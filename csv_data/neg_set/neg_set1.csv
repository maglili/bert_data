Measuring Drosophila (fruit fly) activity during microgravity exposure,11543046,,"Important advances in the understanding of the aging process could be obtained through comprehension of the changes experienced by Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) during microgravity. Previous experiments flown on Cosmos satellites and various Space Shuttle missions have shown a significant decrease in the life span of young male Drosophila after microgravity exposure. Additionally, postflight analysis indicated an accelerated aging of the microgravity exposed male flies since they exhibited a significant decrease in mating ability and a consistently lower negative geotaxis response than the 1 g ground controls. The negative geotaxis response is the Drosophila's reaction to move opposite to the Earth's gravitational vector when disturbed in certain manners. Researchers have hypothesized that the accelerated aging, is due to an increased locomotor activity which causes a subsequent increase in mitochondrial activity. The increased mitochondrial activity, in turn, causes increased aging through accelerated damage to the mitochondrial system. An increase in locomotor activity was indicated by analyzing only a fraction (1/6th of a second) of the 15 minute video recordings of groups of Drosophila taken approximately every two days during a 14-day Space Shuttle flight. The increased locomotor activity may be related to the Drosophila's negative geotaxis response in that the flies may be reacting to the absence of normal gravity by continuously searching for the gravity vector. The aims of this study are to develop methods to accurately measure individual Drosophila activity, use these derived methods in 1 g to create a Drosophila activity baseline, and use the methods during short and long duration microgravity exposure (sounding rockets, parabolic flights, Space Shuttle, International Space Station, etc.) to examine Drosophila activity. The role of the negative geotaxis response on locomotor activity will be examined by using two strains of behaviorally selected Drosophila, one that exhibits a large or hyper negative geotaxis response and another that has a positive geotaxis response, in addition to examining flies with a normal or negative geotaxis response.",1999,"M S Miller, T S Keller, M S Miller, M S Miller, T S Keller, M S Miller"
DNA sequence variation and the recombinational landscape in Drosophila pseudoobscura: a study of the second chromosome,10511563,,"The relationship between rates of recombination and DNA sequence polymorphism was analyzed for the second chromosome of Drosophila pseudoobscura. We constructed integrated genetic and physical maps of this chromosome using molecular markers at 10 loci spanning most of its physical length. The total length of the map was 128.2 cM, almost twice that of the homologous chromosome arm (3R) in D. melanogaster. There appears to be very little centromeric suppression of recombination, and rates of recombination are quite uniform across most of the chromosome. Levels of sequence variation (theta(W), based on the number of segregating sites) at seven loci (tropomyosin 1, Rhodopsin 3, Rhodopsin 1, bicoid, Xanthine dehydrogenase, Myosin light chain 1, and ribosomal protein 49) varied from 0.0036 to 0.0167. Generally consistent with earlier studies, the average estimate of theta(W) at total sites is 1.5-fold higher than that in D. melanogaster, while average theta(W) at silent sites is almost 3-fold higher. These estimates of variation were analyzed in the context of a background selection model under the same parameters of mutation rate and selection as have been proposed for D. melanogaster. It is likely that a significant fraction of the higher level of sequence variation in D. pseudoobscura can be explained by differences in regional rates of recombination rather than a larger species-level effective population size. However, the distribution of variation among synonymous, nonsynonymous, and noncoding sites appears to be quite different between the species, making direct comparisons of neutral variation, and hence inferences about effective population size, difficult. Tajima's D statistics for 6 out of the 7 loci surveyed are negative, suggesting that D. pseudoobscura may have experienced a rapid population expansion in the recent past or, alternatively, that slightly deleterious mutations constitute an important component of standing variation in this species.",1999,"M T Hamblin, C F Aquadro, M T Hamblin, C F Aquadro"
[Maternal and paternal effects on the specific mutation l(1)ts403 of thermosensitivity of early Drosophila melanogaster embryos],10546112,,"High thermosensitivity of early embryos controlled by mutation l(1)ts403 with disturbed heat-shock response was studied. Thermosensitivity was examined in early (0-1 h) and late (3.5-4.5 h) embryos obtained by reciprocal crosses and backcrosses. It was shown that mutation l(1)ts403 lacks maternal effect. In progeny of reciprocal crosses, early embryonic thermosensitivity was intermediate with regard to that of progeny obtained by interlinear crosses. In early embryos of Drosophila, zygotic genes are not expressed and synthesis heat-shock protein synthesis is not induced. Based on this, it was proposed that the product of gene l(1)ts403, which affects early embryonic thermosensitivity, is transmitted both paternally and maternally and shows dosage effect.",1999,"L A Mamon, E A Nikitina, O M Pugacheva, E V Golubkova, L A Mamon, E A Nikitina, O M Pugacheva, E V Golubkova"

"Molecular evolution of two linked genes, Est-6 and Sod, in Drosophila melanogaster",10545464,,"We have obtained 15 sequences of Est-6 from a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster to test whether linkage disequilibrium exists between Est-6 and the closely linked Sod, and whether natural selection may be involved. An early experiment with allozymes had shown linkage disequilibrium between these two loci, while none was detected between other gene pairs. The Sod sequences for the same 15 haplotypes were obtained previously. The two genes exhibit similar levels of nucleotide polymorphism, but the patterns are different. In Est-6, there are nine amino acid replacement polymorphisms, one of which accounts for the S-F allozyme polymorphism. In Sod, there is only one replacement polymorphism, which corresponds to the S-F allozyme polymorphism. The transversion/transition ratio is more than five times larger in Sod than in Est-6. At the nucleotide level, the S and F alleles of Est-6 make up two allele families that are quite different from each other, while there is relatively little variation within each of them. There are also two families of alleles in Sod, one consisting of a subset of F alleles, and the other consisting of another subset of F alleles, designed F(A), plus all the S alleles. The Sod F(A) and S alleles are completely or nearly identical in nucleotide sequence, except for the replacement mutation that accounts for the allozyme difference. The two allele families have independent evolutionary histories in the two genes. There are traces of statistically significant linkage disequilibrium between the two genes that, we suggest, may have arisen as a consequence of selection favoring one particular sequence at each locus.",1999,"E S Balakirev, E I Balakirev, F RodrÃ­guez-Trelles, F J Ayala, E S Balakirev, E I Balakirev, F RodrÃ­guez-Trelles, F J Ayala"
Oviposition-site preference in Drosophila following interspecific gene transfer of the Alcohol dehydrogenase locus,10547927,10.1023/a:1021648103496,"The preference of Drosophila females to lay eggs on substrates that do or do not contain alcohol is an excellent system to study the evolutionary genetics of behavior, because (1) there is variation in this behavior within and among species, (2) the behavior is amenable to laboratory investigation, and (3) the behavior presumably has a direct relationship to reproductive fitness. Moreover, a key genetic component of the system, the Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) locus, is arguably the most well characterized gene known. However, because the Adh gene and its genetic background are inseparable in reproductively isolated species, it is difficult to establish its role in behavioral divergence. By transgene coplacement, we created pairs of strains of D. melanogaster expressing an Adh allele from either D. melanogaster or D. affinidisjuncta, a Hawaiian species with very low levels of ADH in adults. When raised on ethanol-containing medium, the affinidisjuncta-Adh strains experience high mortality relative to the melanogaster-Adh strains. However, affinidisjuncta-Adh females show the same preference for oviposition on ethanol-containing medium as melanogaster-Adh females. Thus, preference for ethanol in these strains is not determined primarily by Adh genotype.",1999,"M L Siegal, D L Hartl, M L Siegal, D L Hartl"
Drosophila telomeres: two transposable elements with important roles in chromosomes,10952212,,"Telomeres in Drosophila melanogaster are composed of multiple copies of two retrotransposable elements, HeT-A and TART instead of the short DNA repeats generated by telomerase in most organisms. Transpositions of HeT-A and TART yield arrays of repeats larger and more irregular than the repeats produced by telomerase; nevertheless, these transpositions are, in principle, equivalent to the telomere-building action of telomerase. Both telomerase and transposition of HeT-A and TART extend chromosomes by RNA-templated addition of specific sequences. We have proposed that HeT-A has evolved from genes encoding telomerase components. Although both HeT-A and TART share some novel features, TART probably has a different origin from HeT-A. HeT-A and TART are clearly identifiable as non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons. Both telomere elements transpose only to the ends of chromosomes (apparently to any chromosome end in D. melanogaster) and each contains a large segment of untranslated sequence. HeT-A and TART are the first examples of transposable elements with a clear role in chromosome structure. This has interesting implications for the evolution of both chromosomes and transposable elements. The finding also raises the possibility that other transposable elements with bona fide roles in the cell will be detected, not only in Drosophila, but also in other organisms.",1999,"M L Pardue, P G DeBaryshe, M L Pardue, P G DeBaryshe"
"Evolution of the RECQ family of helicases: A drosophila homolog, Dmblm, is similar to the human bloom syndrome gene",10049920,,"Several eukaryotic homologs of the Escherichia coli RecQ DNA helicase have been found. These include the human BLM gene, whose mutation results in Bloom syndrome, and the human WRN gene, whose mutation leads to Werner syndrome resembling premature aging. We cloned a Drosophila melanogaster homolog of the RECQ helicase family, Dmblm (Drosophila melanogaster Bloom), which encodes a putative 1487-amino-acid protein. Phylogenetic and dot plot analyses for the RECQ family, including 10 eukaryotic and 3 prokaryotic genes, indicate Dmblm is most closely related to the Homo sapiens BLM gene, suggesting functional similarity. Also, we found that Dmblm cDNA partially rescued the sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate of Saccharomyces cerevisiae sgs1 mutant, demonstrating the presence of a functional similarity between Dmblm and SGS1. Our analyses identify four possible subfamilies in the RECQ family: (1) the BLM subgroup (H. sapiens Bloom, D. melanogaster Dmblm, and Caenorhabditis elegans T04A11.6); (2) the yeast RECQ subgroup (S. cerevisiae SGS1 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe rqh1/rad12); (3) the RECQL/Q1 subgroup (H. sapiens RECQL/Q1 and C. elegans K02F3.1); and (4) the WRN subgroup (H. sapiens Werner and C. elegans F18C5.2). This result may indicate that metazoans hold at least three RECQ genes, each of which may have a different function, and that multiple RECQ genes diverged with the generation of multicellular organisms.

This research program has led to exciting but sweeping generalizations about how development evolves. Here we examine several underlying assumptions of this approach in terms of comparative and historical biology. First, we evaluate the logic that underlies the equation of gene expression similarity with homologous morphology.

Correlated responses to selection on body size in Drosophila melanogaster,10505406,10.1017/s0016672399003778,"Correlated responses to artificial selection on body size in Drosophila melanogaster were investigated, to determine how the changes in size were produced during development.

Selection for reduced thorax length was associated with reduced growth rate, no change in duration of larval development and a reduced critical larval weight for pupariation. In both lines selected for thorax length and lines selected for wing area, total body size changed in the same direction as the artificially selected trait. In large selection lines of both types, the increase in size was achieved almost entirely by an increase in cell number, while in the small lines the decrease in size was achieved predominantly by reduced cell size, and also by a reduction in cell number.

Suppression of polyglutamine-mediated neurodegeneration in Drosophila by the molecular chaperone HSP70,10581028,10.1038/70532,"At least eight inherited human neurodegenerative diseases are caused by expansion of a polyglutamine domain within the respective proteins. This confers dominant toxicity on the proteins, leading to dysfunction and loss of neurons. Expanded polyglutamine proteins form aggregates, including nuclear inclusions (NI), within neurons, possibly due to misfolding of the proteins. NI are ubiquitinated and sequester molecular chaperone proteins and proteasome components, suggesting that disease pathogenesis includes activation of cellular stress pathways to help refold, disaggregate or degrade the mutant disease proteins. Overexpression of specific chaperone proteins reduces polyglutamine aggregation in transfected cells, but whether this alters toxicity is unknown. Using a Drosophila melanogaster model of polyglutamine disease, we show that directed expression of the molecular chaperone HSP70 suppresses polyglutamine-induced neurodegeneration in vivo. Suppression by HSP70 occurred without a visible effect on NI formation, indicating that polyglutamine toxicity can be dissociated from formation of large aggregates. Our studies indicate that HSP70 or related molecular chaperones may provide a means of treating these and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with abnormal protein conformation and toxicity.",1999,"J M Warrick, H Y Chan, G L Gray-Board, Y Chai, H L Paulson, N M Bonini, J M Warrick, H Y Chan, G L Gray-Board, Y Chai, H L Paulson, N M Bonini"
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the SNF4/AMPK gamma subunit gene from Drosophila melanogaster,10659773,10.1139/gen-42-6-1077,"To optimize gene expression under different environmental conditions, many organisms have evolved systems which can quickly up- and down-regulate the activity of other genes. Recently, the SNF1 kinase complex from yeast and the AMP-activated protein kinase complex from mammals have been shown to represent homologous metabolic sensors that are key to regulating energy levels under times of metabolic stress. Using heterologous probing, we have cloned the Drosophila melanogaster homologue of SNF4, the noncatalytic effector subunit from this kinase complex. A sequence corresponding to the partial genomic sequence as well as the full-length cDNA was obtained, and shows that the D. melanogaster SNF4 is encoded in a 1944-bp cDNA representing a protein of 648 amino acids (aa). Southern analysis of Drosophila genomic DNA in concert with a survey of mammalian SNF4 ESTs indicates that in metazoans, SNF4 is a duplicated gene, and possibly even a larger gene family. We propose that one gene copy codes for a short (330 aa) protein, whereas the second locus codes for a longer version (<410 aa) that is extended at the carboxy terminus, as typified by the Drosophila homologue presented here. Phylogenetic analysis of yeast, invertebrate, and multiple mammalian isoforms of SNF4 shows that the gene duplication likely occurred early in the metazoan lineage, as the protein products of the different loci are relatively divergent. When the phylogeny was extended beyond the SNF4 gene family, SNF4 shares sequence similarity with other cystathionine-beta-synthase domain-containing proteins, including IMP dehydrogenase and a variety of uncharacterized Methanococcus proteins.",1999,"E N Yoshida, B F Benkel, Y Fong, D A Hickey, E N Yoshida, B F Benkel, Y Fong, D A Hickey"

Five of these eight complementation groups, including the semidominant mutation, have been mapped using chromosomal deficiencies and meiotic recombination. Two complementation groups mapped close to the Myosin heavy chain gene, but they are shown to be in different loci. Developmental analysis of three mutations showed that two of these are involved in the early stages of adult myogenesis while the other showed late defects.

Untranslated 3' ends of the convergently transcribed genes Cs and Ddc are known to overlap by 88bp. A number of questions arise about the organization of this tightly-packed gene region and about the evolution and function of the Cs gene. We have now investigated this three-gene cluster in Scaptodrosophila lebanonensis (which diverged from D. melanogaster 60-65 MYA), as well as in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Gene order and direction of transcription is the same in all three species. The Cs gene codes, in Scaptodrosophila, for a polypeptide of 544 amino acids; in D. melanogaster, it consists of 504 amino acids, which is twice as long as previously suggested, which makes the gene density even more spectacular. The Cs sequences exhibit higher number of non-synonymous substitutions between species, higher ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, and lower codon usage bias than other genes, suggesting that Cs is less functionally constrained than the other genes. This is consistent with the failure of inducing phenotypic mutations in D. melanogaster. The function of Cs remains to be identified, but a high degree of similarity indicates that it is homologous to genes coding for a corticosteroid-binding protein in yeast and a polyamine oxidase in maize.",1999,"A Tatarenkov, A G SÃ¡ez, F J Ayala, A Tatarenkov, A G SÃ¡ez, F J Ayala"
Identification of novel Drosophila meiotic genes recovered in a P-element screen,10353897,,"The segregation of homologous chromosomes from one another is the essence of meiosis. In many organisms, accurate segregation is ensured by the formation of chiasmata resulting from crossing over. Drosophila melanogaster females use this type of recombination-based system, but they also have mechanisms for segregating achiasmate chromosomes with high fidelity. We describe a P-element mutagenesis and screen in a sensitized genetic background to detect mutations that impair meiotic chromosome pairing, recombination, or segregation. Our screen identified two new recombination-deficient mutations: mei-P22, which fully eliminates meiotic recombination, and mei-P26, which decreases meiotic exchange by 70% in a polar fashion. We also recovered an unusual allele of the ncd gene, whose wild-type product is required for proper structure and function of the meiotic spindle. However, the screen yielded primarily mutants specifically defective in the segregation of achiasmate chromosomes.

Lack of nucleotide polymorphism in the Y-linked sperm flagellar dynein gene Dhc-Yh3 of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans,10581278,,"We studied levels of intra- and interspecific nucleotide variation associated with a Y-linked gene in five members of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. Using published sequence for 348 bp of the Dhc-Yh3 gene, and degenerate PCR primers designed from comparisons of the sea urchin and Chlamydomonas flagellar dynein genes, we recovered a 1738-bp region in D. melanogaster. Analyses of sequence variation in a worldwide collection of 11 lines of D. melanogaster and 10 lines of D. simulans found only a single silent polymorphism in the latter species. The synonymous site divergence per site for Dhc-Yh3 is comparable to values for X and autosomal genes. Assuming a Wright-Fisher population model, the lack of variation is statistically less than expected using appropriately reduced estimates of theta from the X and autosomes. Because the Y chromosome encodes only six known genes, genetic hitchhiking associated with background selection is unlikely to explain this low variation. Conversely, adaptive hitchhiking, as associated with sex-ratio chromosomes, or a large variance in male fertility may reduce the polymorphism on the Y chromosome. Codon bias is very low, as seen for other genes in regions of low recombination.",1999,"M Zurovcova, W F Eanes, M Zurovcova, W F Eanes"

In all these bioassays on Drosophila larvae, the two purely synthetic hydrazines exhibited similar dose-response relationships as did the natural steroid hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone. In assays involving induction of early chromosomal puffs (74EF, 75B) or regression of the preexisting puffs (25AC, 68C), the dosages required for induction of standard ED-50 effects were one order of magnitude larger for the hydrazines in comparison with 20-hydroxyecdysone. In the assays related to glycoprotein glue secretion, evagination of imaginal discs, or rescue of phenotypic expression in ecdysone-deficient mutants, 20-hydroxyecdysone was two orders of magnitude more active than RH-5849 and RH-5992. We conclude that, in spite of these quantitative differences, the two hydrazine compounds studied are able to duplicate in Drosophila larvae the complex of qualitative biological effects that are a prerequisite for ecdysteroid hormones.

Results were consistent with most pattern modifications being small rearrangements within the body of the element. In agreement with the existence of spontaneous rearrangements of this kind is the observation that many genomic copies of element 297 are defective and these are not limited to heterochromatin.

Spectral sensitivity of wild-type and mutant Drosophila melanogaster larvae,10928215,10.3109/01677069909083471,"Wild-type (Canton-S) Drosophila melanogaster larvae are generally repelled by white light.

To characterize the behavior of larvae from the mutant stocks and the isofemale line more precisely, we determined the range of wavelengths that repel wild-type (Canton-S) D. melanogaster larvae and identified wavelengths to which larvae are most sensitive. In comparison to adult flies, Canton-S larvae are much less sensitive to white light and respond to a narrower range of wavelengths. The wavelengths to which Canton-S larvae are maximally sensitive are 500 nm (green), 420 nm (indigo), and 380 nm (ultraviolet). Mutant lphA larvae respond abnormally to green and indigo light but are as strongly repelled by ultraviolet light as controls. In contrast, mutant LphB larvae and larvae from the LI2 isofemale line are unresponsive to green, indigo, or ultraviolet light. Thus, lphA larvae have a wavelength-specific defect, while LphB and LI2 larvae are generally unresponsive to wavelengths that repel wild-type larvae.",1999,"J M Warrick, M F Vakil, L Tompkins, J M Warrick, M F Vakil, L Tompkins"
Polymorphism in structure of the retrotransposable element 412 in Drosophila simulans and D. melanogaster populations,10352229,10.1016/s0378-1119(99)00126-2,"The structure of the 412 retrotransposable element was investigated in various natural populations of D. melanogaster and D. simulans by a restriction enzyme analysis. We show that although the canonical structure of the 412 element was the same in both species, a high structural polymorphism existed with various rearranged elements. A 412 family was thus composed of heterogeneous copies of different sizes, with a large proportion of full-size copies. D. simulans had more rearranged copies than D. melanogaster, with some specific copies, such as a 5.6-kb BsrBI fragment, present in all populations of D. simulans. Full-size and rearranged copies were detected in both the euchromatin and the heterochromatin, with many rearranged copies in D. simulans, suggesting a recent mobilization of the 412 element in this species.",1999,"G Cizeron, C BiÃ©mont, G Cizeron, C BiÃ©mont"
Antioxidative effects of melatonin in Drosophila melanogaster: antagonization of damage induced by the inhibition of catalase,10535764,10.1111/j.1600-079x.1999.tb00610.x,"In Drosophila melanogaster strain Canton S, the catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole was used to enhance oxidative stress from endogenous sources. This treatment was chosen as an alternative to direct administration of oxidants, which would cause damage and interact with melatonin already in the extracellular space before they reach the intracellular compartments. Male flies were kept in constant darkness and fed 1% sucrose as the only diet, with or without additions of melatonin (2 mM), inhibitor (100 mM), or combinations of both. After 20 or 24 hr, most of the animals exposed to 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole only had died, whereas a large number of flies had survived the inhibitor treatment in the presence of melatonin. Protein carbonyl, an indicator of oxidative protein modification, and lipid peroxidation, as determined by the formation of malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxyalkenal, were measured in flies treated for 20 hr. Melatonin alone did not substantially change these parameters, but prevented the increase in protein carbonyl caused by the catalase inhibitor. The effect of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole on lipid peroxidation was relatively minor, but a clear-cut inhibition was found after simultaneous administration of melatonin. The preferential suppression of oxidative damage of proteins, as compared to lipids, indicates a particular protective role for melatonin in the aqueous phase of cellular compartments.",1999,"A Coto-Montes, R Hardeland, A Coto-Montes, R Hardeland"
Evidence for the recent horizontal transfer of long terminal repeat retrotransposon,10535972,10.1073/pnas.96.22.12621,"The evolutionary dynamics existing between transposable elements (TEs) and their host genomes have been likened to an ""arms race."" The selfish drive of TEs to replicate, in turn, elicits the evolution of host-mediated regulatory mechanisms aimed at repressing transpositional activity. It has been postulated that horizontal (cross-species) transfer may be one effective strategy by which TEs and other selfish genes can escape host-mediated silencing mechanisms over evolutionary time; however, to date, the most definitive evidence that TEs horizontally transfer between species has been limited to class II or DNA-type elements. Evidence that the more numerous and widely distributed retroelements may also be horizontally transferred between species has been more ambiguous.

Drosophila wing melanin patterns form by vein-dependent elaboration of enzymatic prepatterns,10607562,10.1016/s0960-9822(00)80083-4,"Background:
      
    

    
      Animal melanin patterns are involved in diverse aspects of their ecology, from thermoregulation to mimicry. Many theoretical models have simulated pigment patterning, but little is known about the developmental mechanisms of color pattern formation. In Drosophila melanogaster, several genes are known to be necessary for cuticular melanization, but the involvement of these genes in melanin pattern evolution is unknown. We have taken a genetic approach to elucidate the developmental mechanisms underlying melanin pattern formation in various drosophilids.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We show that, in D. melanogaster, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopa decarboxylase (DDC) are required for melanin synthesis. Ectopic expression of TH, but not DDC, alone was sufficient to cause ectopic melanin patterns in the wing. Thus, changes in the level of expression of a single gene can result in a new level of melanization. The ontogeny of this ectopic melanization resembled that found in Drosophila species bearing wing melanin patterns and in D. melanogaster ebony mutants. Importantly, we discovered that in D. melanogaster and three other Drosophila species these wing melanin patterns are dependent upon and shaped by the circulation patterns of hemolymph in the wing veins.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Complex wing melanin patterns are determined by two distinct developmental mechanisms. Spatial prepatterns of enzymatic activity are established late in wing development. Then, in newly eclosed adults, melanin precursors gradually diffuse out from wing veins and are oxidized into dark brown or black melanin. Both the prepatterning and hemolymph-supplied components of this system can change during evolution to produce color pattern diversity.",1999,"J R True, K A Edwards, D Yamamoto, S B Carroll, J R True, K A Edwards, D Yamamoto, S B Carroll"
The synergistic effects of vanillin on recombination predominate over its antimutagenic action in relation to MMC-induced lesions in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,10521675,10.1016/s1383-5718(99)00101-1,"The wing Somatic Mutation And Recombination Test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster was used to study the modulating action of vanillin (VA) in combination with the alkylating agents mitomycin C (MMC), methylmethanesulphonate (MMS) and the bifunctional nitrogen mustard (HN2). Two types of treatments with VA and each of the three genotoxins were performed: chronic co-treatments of three-day-old larvae of the standard cross as well as post-treatments after acute exposure with the genotoxins. This allowed the study of the action of VA not only in the steps that precede the induction of DNA lesions but also in the repair processes. The overall findings from the co-treatment series suggest that ingestion of VA with MMS or MMC can lead to significant protection against genotoxicity; but this is not the case with HN2. Antioxidant activity, suppression of metabolic activation or interaction with the active groups of these two alkylating agents could be mechanisms by means of which VA exerts its desmutagenic action. In contrast, when evaluated in the post-treatment procedure, VA causes two antagonistic effects on the genotoxicity of MMC: (i) synergism on recombination (172.8%) and (ii) protection against mutation (79.0%). Consequently, both activities together lead to a considerable increase in mitotic recombination. In spite of being separate events, recombination and gene mutation are correlated during mitosis since the fate of a DNA lesion depends on the repair pathway followed. Our results may suggest that VA is a modifying factor that blocks the mutagenic pathway and consequently directs the MMC-induced lesions into a recombinational repair. Furthermore, VA did not modify the genotoxicity when administered after treatments with HN2 or MMS. Therefore, the major finding of the present study, namely the co-recombinagenic activity of VA on MMC-induced lesions, seems to be related to the type of induced lesion and consequently to the repair processes involved in its correction.",1999,"J H Santos, U Graf, M L Reguly, H H Rodrigues de Andrade, J H Santos, U Graf, M L Reguly, H H Rodrigues de Andrade"
"A role for amontillado, the Drosophila homolog of the neuropeptide precursor processing protease PC2, in triggering hatching behavior",10436051,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.19-16-06942.1999,"Accurate proteolytic processing of neuropeptide and peptide hormone precursors by members of the kexin/furin family of proteases is key to determining both the identities and activities of signaling peptides. Here we identify amontillado (amon), the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of the mammalian neuropeptide processing protease PC2, and show that in contrast to vertebrate PC2, amontillado expression undergoes extensive regulation in the nervous system during development. In situ hybridization reveals that expression of amontillado is restricted to the final stages of embryogenesis when it is found in anterior sensory structures and in only 168 cells in the brain and ventral nerve cord. After larvae hatch from their egg shells, the sensory structures and most cells in the CNS turn off or substantially reduce amontillado expression, suggesting that amontillado plays a specific role late in embryogenesis. Larvae lacking the chromosomal region containing amontillado show no gross anatomical defects and respond to touch. However, such larvae show a greatly reduced frequency of a hatching behavior of wild-type Drosophila in which larvae swing their heads, scraping through the eggshell with their mouth hooks. Ubiquitous expression of amontillado can restore near wild-type levels of this behavior, whereas expression of amontillado with an alanine substitution for the catalytic histidine cannot. These results suggest that amontillado expression is regulated as part of a programmed modulation of neural signaling that controls hatching behavior by producing specific neuropeptides in particular neurons at an appropriate developmental time.",1999,"D E Siekhaus, R S Fuller, D E Siekhaus, R S Fuller"
Hedgehog signaling and the axial patterning of Drosophila wings,11103949,10.1139/o00-072,Growth and cell fate in the anterior-posterior (A/P) axis of the developing wing of Drosophila melanogaster are controlled by a stripe of cells bisecting the axis called the A/P organizer. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling from posterior to anterior cells induces the organizer. Several Hh-responsive genes expressed by cells of the organizer mediate its patterning activity. The Hh-signaling pathway controls the post-translational modification of the transcription factor Cubitus-interruptus (Ci) and the resulting local activation of Ci is required for the correct location of the A/P organizer.,2000,"W J Brook, W J Brook"
Behavioral characterization and genetic analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster larval response to light as revealed by a novel individual assay,10934800,10.1023/a:1002090627601,"A new assay was designed, named checker, that measures the individual response to light in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster larva. In this assay the Drosophila larva apparently modulates its pattern of locomotion when faced with a choice between a dark and lit environment by orienting its movement towards the dark environment. We show that, in this assay, a response to light can be measured as an increase in residence time in the dark versus the lit quadrant. Mutations that disrupt phototransduction in the adult Drosophila abolish the larval response to light, demonstrating that this larval visual function is similar to that of the adult fly. Similarly, no response to light was detected in strains where the larval visual system (photoreceptors and target area) was disrupted by a mutation in the homeobox containing gene sine oculis (so) gene. Ablation of photoreceptors by the targeted expression of the cell death gene hid under the control of the photoreceptor-specific transcription factor glass (gl) abolishes this response entirely. Finally, we demonstrate that this response to light can be mediated by rhodopsins other than the blue absorbing Rh1.",2000,"J Hassan, M Busto, B Iyengar, A R Campos, J Hassan, M Busto, B Iyengar, A R Campos"

While D. mauritiana males mate well with both D. melanogaster and D. simulans females, females of D. mauritiana discriminate strongly against males of these two species. Similarly, D. simulans males mate with D. melanogaster females but the reciprocal cross is difficult. Interspecific crosses between several populations of the three species were performed to determine if (i) males and females of the same species share a common sexual isolation genetic system, and (ii) males (or females) use the same genetic system to discriminate against females (or males) of the other two species. Results indicate that although differences in male and female isolation depend on the populations tested, the isolation behaviour between a pair of species is highly correlated despite the variations. However, the rank order of the isolation level along the populations was not correlated in both sexes, which suggests that different genes act in male and female sexual isolation. Neither for males nor for females, the isolation behaviour of one species was paralleled in the other two species, which indicates that the genetic systems involved in this trait are species-pair specific.

"Temporally restricted expression of transcription factor betaFTZ-F1: significance for embryogenesis, molting and metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster",11060234,,"FTZ-F1, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, has been implicated in the activation of the segmentation gene fushi tarazu during early embryogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster. We found that an isoform of FTZ-F1, betaFTZ-F1, is expressed in the nuclei of almost all tissues slightly before the first and second larval ecdysis and before pupation. Severely affected ftz-f1 mutants display an embryonic lethal phenotype, but can be rescued by ectopic expression of betaFTZ-F1 during the period of endogenous betaFTZ-F1 expression in the wild type. The resulting larvae are not able to molt, but this activity is rescued again by forced expression of betaFTZ-F1, allowing progression to the next larval instar stage. On the other hand, premature expression of betaFTZ-F1 in wild-type larvae at mid-first instar or mid-second instar stages causes defects in the molting process. Sensitive periods were found to be around the time of peak ecdysteroid levels and slightly before the start of endogenous betaFTZ-F1 expression. A hypomorphic ftz-f1 mutant that arrests in the prepupal stage can also be rescued by ectopic, time-specific expression of betaFTZ-F1. Failure of salivary gland histolysis, one of the phenotypes of the ftz-f1 mutant, is rescued by forced expression of the ftz-f1 downstream gene BR-C during the late prepupal period. These results suggest that betaFTZ-F1 regulates genes associated with ecdysis and metamorphosis, and that the exact timing of its action in the ecdysone-induced gene cascade is important for proper development.",2000,"M Yamada, T Murata, S Hirose, G Lavorgna, E Suzuki, H Ueda, M Yamada, T Murata, S Hirose, G Lavorgna, E Suzuki, H Ueda"
Novel aspects of the transport of organic anions by the malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster,11060218,,"Para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) is a negatively charged organic ion that can pass across the epithelium of Malpighian tubules. Its mode of transport was studied in Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster. PAH transport was an active process, with a K(m) of 2. 74 mmol l(-)(1) and a V(max) of 88.8 pmol min(-)(1). Tubules had a low passive permeability to PAH, but PAH transport rates (832 nmol min(-)(1 )mm(2)) and concentrative ability ([PAH](secreted fluid):[PAH](bath)=81.2) were the highest measured to date for insects. Competition experiments indicated that there were two organic anion transporters, one that transports carboxylate compounds, such as PAH and fluorescein, and another that transports sulphonates, such as amaranth and Indigo Carmine. PAH transport appears to be maximal in vivo because the rate of transport by isolated tubules is not increased when these are challenged with cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP, leucokinin I or staurosporine. Basolateral PAH transport was inhibited by ouabain and dependent on the Na(+) gradient. The Malpighian tubules appeared not to possess an organic acid/ &agr; -keto acid exchanger because PAH accumulation was not affected by low concentrations (100 micromol l(-)(1)) of &agr; -keto acids ( &agr; -ketoglutarate, glutarate, citrate and succinate) or the activity of phosphokinase C. PAH transport may be directly coupled to the Na(+) gradient, perhaps via Na(+)/organic acid cotransport. Fluorescence microscopy showed that transport of the carboxylate fluorescein was confined to the principal cells of the main (secretory) segment and all the cells of the lower (reabsorptive) segment. Organic anions were transported across the cytoplasm of the principal cells both by diffusion and in vesicles. The accumulation of punctate fluorescence in the lumen is consistent with exocytosis of the cytoplasmic vesicles. Apical PAH transport was independent of the apical membrane potential and may not occur by an electrodiffusive mechanism.",2000,"S M Linton, M J O'Donnell, S M Linton, M J O'Donnell"
The longitudinal visceral musculature of Drosophila melanogaster persists through metamorphosis,10906449,10.1016/s0925-4773(00)00328-2,"The larval gut of Drosophila is coated with visceral muscles of mesodermal origin.

The complete visceral musculature is described to be removed during metamorphosis and to be replaced by a newly differentiated imaginal tissue resembling the morphology of the larval musculature. However, progenitors of this imaginal visceral musculature have never been detected prior to differentiation. Here I present results indicating that the longitudinal visceral musculature of the midgut completely persists through metamorphosis. Single cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker were transplanted at the blastoderm stage. All clones contributing to the longitudinal visceral musculature detected in third instar larvae were recovered after metamorphosis in adult flies. Further evidence for the persistence of the larval visceral musculature was obtained from the P[Gal4] insertion line 5053A. It expresses GAL4 specifically in the longitudinal visceral muscles of the midgut of all developmental stages to the adult fly beginning at the end of embryogenesis. By using GFP as a reporter, it was possible to follow these cells through the entire metamorphosis. Although the muscles undergo dramatic morphological changes including the loss of their contractile system, no evidence for a replacement of the larval visceral musculature by imaginal precursor cells was detected.",2000,"R Klapper, R Klapper"

Just two integrins are present in C. elegans: one putative RGD binding integrin alphapat-2betapat-3, corresponding to Drosophila alphaPS2betaPS and vertebrate alpha5beta1, alphaVbeta1 and alpha8beta1, and one putative laminin binding integrin alphaina-1betapat-3, corresponding to Drosophila alphaPS1betaPS and vertebrate alpha3beta1, alpha6beta1 and alpha7beta1. In this review, the function of this minimal set of integrins during the development of these two invertebrates is compared. Despite the differences in bodyplan and developmental strategy, integrin adhesion to the extracellular matrix is required for similar processes: the formation of the link that translates muscle contraction into movement of the exoskeleton, cell migration, and morphogenetic interactions between epithelia. Other integrin functions, such as regulation of gene expression, have not yet been experimentally demonstrated in both organisms. Additional proteins have been characterised in each organism that are essential for integrin function, including extracellular matrix ligands and intracellular interacting proteins, but so far different proteins have been found in the two organisms. This in part represents the fact that the characterisation of the full set of interacting proteins is not complete in either system. However, in other cases different proteins appear to be used for similar functions in the two animals. The continued use of genetic approaches to identify proteins required for integrin function in these two model organisms should lead to the identification of the minimal set of conserved components that form integrin adhesive structures.",2000,"N H Brown, N H Brown"

Functional evolution of the Ultrabithorax protein,10639143,10.1073/pnas.97.2.704,"The Hox genes have been implicated as central to the evolution of animal body plan diversity. Regulatory changes both in Hox expression domains and in Hox-regulated gene networks have arisen during the evolution of related taxa, but there is little knowledge of whether functional changes in Hox proteins have also contributed to morphological evolution. For example, the evolution of greater numbers of differentiated segments and body parts in insects, compared with the simpler body plans of arthropod ancestors, may have involved an increase in the spectrum of biochemical interactions of individual Hox proteins. Here, we compare the in vivo functions of orthologous Ultrabithorax (Ubx) proteins from the insect Drosophila melanogaster and from an onychophoran, a member of a sister phylum with a more primitive and homonomous body plan. These Ubx proteins, which have been diverging in sequence for over 540 million years, can generate many of the same gain-of-function tissue transformations and can activate and repress many of the same target genes when expressed during Drosophila development. However, the onychophora Ubx (OUbx) protein does not transform the segmental identity of the embryonic ectoderm or repress the Distal-less target gene. This functional divergence is due to sequence changes outside the conserved homeodomain region. The inability of OUbx to function like Drosophila Ubx (DUbx) in the embryonic ectoderm indicates that the Ubx protein may have acquired new cofactors or activity modifiers since the divergence of the onychophoran and insect lineages.",2000,"J K Grenier, S B Carroll, J K Grenier, S B Carroll"

Quantitative trait loci affecting components of wing shape in Drosophila melanogaster,10835390,,"Two composite multiple regression-interval mapping analyses were performed to identify candidate quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting components of wing shape in Drosophila melanogaster defined by eight relative warp-based measures. A recombinant inbred line design was used to map QTL for the shape of two intervein regions in the anterior compartment of the wing, using a high resolution map of retrotransposon insertion sites between Oregon-R and Russian 2b. A total of 35 QTL representing up to 23 different loci were identified, many of which are located near components of the epidermal growth factor-Ras signal transduction pathway that regulates vein vs. intervein decision making and vein placement. Over one-half of the loci were detected in both sexes, and just under one-half were detected at two different growth temperatures. Different loci were found to affect aspects of shape in each intervein region, confirming that the shape of the whole wing should be regarded as a compound trait composed of several developmental units. In addition, a reciprocal backcross design was used to map QTL affecting shape in the posterior compartment of the wings of 831 flies, using a molecular map of 16 allele-specific oligohybridization single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers between two divergent inbred lines. A total of 13 QTL were detected and shown to have generally additive effects on separable components of shape, in both sexes. By contrast, 8 QTL that affected wing size in these backcrosses were nearly dominant in their effects. The results confirm at the genetic level that wing shape is regulated independent of wing size and set up the hypothesis that wing shape is regulated in part through the regulation of the length and positioning of wing veins, involving quantitative regulation of the activity of secreted growth factors.",2000,"E Zimmerman, A Palsson, G Gibson, E Zimmerman, A Palsson, G Gibson"
Regulation of the vitellogenin receptor during Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis,10679010,10.1091/mbc.11.2.511,"In many insects, development of the oocyte arrests temporarily just before vitellogenesis, the period when vitellogenins (yolk proteins) accumulate in the oocyte. Following hormonal and environmental cues, development of the oocyte resumes, and endocytosis of vitellogenins begins. An essential component of yolk uptake is the vitellogenin receptor. In this report, we describe the ovarian expression pattern and subcellular localization of the mRNA and protein encoded by the Drosophila melanogaster vitellogenin receptor gene yolkless (yl). yl RNA and protein are both expressed very early during the development of the oocyte, long before vitellogenesis begins. RNA in situ hybridization and lacZ reporter analyses show that yl RNA is synthesized by the germ line nurse cells and then transported to the oocyte. Yl protein is evenly distributed throughout the oocyte during the previtellogenic stages of oogenesis, demonstrating that the failure to take up yolk in these early stage oocyte is not due to the absence of the receptor. The transition to the vitellogenic stages is marked by the accumulation of yolk via clathrin-coated vesicles. After this transition, yolk protein receptor levels increase markedly at the cortex of the egg. Consistent with its role in yolk uptake, immunogold labeling of the receptor reveals Yl in endocytic structures at the cortex of wild-type vitellogenic oocytes. In addition, shortly after the inception of yolk uptake, we find multivesicular bodies where the yolk and receptor are distinctly partitioned. By the end of vitellogenesis, the receptor localizes predominantly to the cortex of the oocyte. However, during oogenesis in yl mutants that express full-length protein yet fail to incorporate yolk proteins, the receptor remains evenly distributed throughout the oocyte.",2000,"C P Schonbaum, J J Perrino, A P Mahowald, C P Schonbaum, J J Perrino, A P Mahowald"

The number of epidermal cells roughly equals the number of sensilla, except for regions where the latter are scarce or absent. Each epidermal cell forms about two non-innervated spinules, a prominent subcuticular space and a conspicuous basal labyrinth, suggesting a high rate of fluid transport through the sensory epithelium. The internal organization and fine structure of trichoid, intermediate and basiconic sensilla is very similar. Receptor cell somata are invested by thin glial sheaths extending distad to the inner dendritic segments. Further distally, the thecogen cell forms a sleeve around the dendrites, but an extracellular dendrite sheath is absent. At the base of the cuticular apparatus, the inner sensillum-lymph space around the ciliary and outer dendritic segments is confluent with the large outer sensillum-lymph space formed by the trichogen and tormogen cells. All three auxiliary cells exhibit many features of secretory and transport cells but extend only thin basal processes towards the haemolymph sinus. The bauplan and fine structure of coeloconic sensilla differs in the following aspects: (1) the ciliary segment of the dendrites is located deeper below the base of the cuticular apparatus than in the other sensillum types; (2) a prominent dendrite sheath is always present, separating inner and outer sensillum-lymph spaces completely; (3) the apical microlamellae of the auxiliary cells are more elaborate, but free sensillum-lymph spaces are almost absent; (4) there are always four not three auxiliary cells. Morphometric data are presented on the diameter of inner and outer dendritic segments and on the size of receptor cells, as well as of the receptor and auxiliary cell nuclei. The special fine structural features of Drosophila olfactory sensilla are discussed under the aspects of sensillar function and the localization of proteins relevant for stimulus transduction.",2000,"S R Shanbhag, B MÃ¼ller, R A Steinbrecht, S R Shanbhag, B MÃ¼ller, R A Steinbrecht"
The occurrence of double strand DNA breaks is not the sole condition for meiotic crossing over in Drosophila melanogaster,11145425,10.1023/a:1004003319569,"Analysis of the interchromosomal effects of In(2L + 2R)Cy, In(3L + 3R)LVM and their joint effect on the frequencies of single and double crossovers in the cv-v-f region of the X chromosome as well as interference showed that both inversions, occurring separately, increased the frequency of single as well as double crossovers and the coefficient of coincidence. However, when the inversions occurred together the frequencies of single crossovers no longer increased, but the frequency of double crossovers, as well as the coefficient of coincidence did increase. These results indicate firstly that the interchromosomal effects influence some precondition of exchange, but that this precondition is not an occurrence of double strand DNA breaks. Thus, the occurrence of double strand DNA breaks is not the sole condition for crossing over in Drosophila melanogaster.",2000,"P Portin, M Rantanen, P Portin, M Rantanen"

The determination of histamine in the Drosophila head,10996374,10.1016/s0165-0270(00)00259-4,"Histamine is a neurotransmitter at arthropod photoreceptors. Even though the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a widely used model in neuroscience research, the histamine content of its nervous system has not so far been reported. We have developed a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with pre-column o-phtaldialdehyde-mercaptoethanol (OPA-ME) derivatization and electrochemical detection, to determine this amine in Drosophila. The histamine content of the fly's head averages about 2.0 ng per head. In heads of the mutant hdc(JK910), a presumed null for the gene encoding the enzyme that synthesizes histamine, histamine was not detected in measurable amounts. In heads of the mutant sine oculis, which lacks compound eyes, only 28% of this amine was found compared with wild type flies, so histamine is mainly present in the compound eye photoreceptors. Also observed in histamine-deficient mutants was a decrease in the peak which contains a substance having the same retention time as carcinine (beta-alanyl-histamine). Our method was not able to detect compounds previously reported as histamine metabolites in insects. In spite of this, the method we have developed enables the fast and accurate measurement of histamine in the heads of Drosophila, suitable for screening mutants.",2000,"J Borycz, M Vohra, G Tokarczyk, I A Meinertzhagen, J Borycz, M Vohra, G Tokarczyk, I A Meinertzhagen"
"Debcl, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologue, is a component of the Drosophila melanogaster cell death machinery",10684252,10.1083/jcb.148.4.703,"Bcl-2 family of proteins are key regulators of apoptosis. Both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members of this family are found in mammalian cells, but no such proteins have been described in insects. Here, we report the identification and characterization of Debcl, the first Bcl-2 homologue in Drosophila melanogaster. Structurally, Debcl is similar to Bax-like proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Ectopic expression of Debcl in cultured cells and in transgenic flies causes apoptosis, which is inhibited by coexpression of the baculovirus caspase inhibitor P35, indicating that Debcl is a proapoptotic protein that functions in a caspase-dependent manner. debcl expression correlates with developmental cell death in specific Drosophila tissues. We also show that debcl genetically interacts with diap1 and dark, and that debcl-mediated apoptosis is not affected by gene dosage of rpr, hid, and grim. Biochemically, Debcl can interact with several mammalian and viral prosurvival Bcl-2 family members, but not with the proapoptotic members, suggesting that it may regulate apoptosis by antagonizing prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins. RNA interference studies indicate that Debcl is required for developmental apoptosis in Drosophila embryos. These results suggest that the main components of the mammalian apoptosis machinery are conserved in insects.",2000,"P A Colussi, L M Quinn, D C Huang, M Coombe, S H Read, H Richardson, S Kumar, P A Colussi, L M Quinn, D C Huang, M Coombe, S H Read, H Richardson, S Kumar"
P-element transposition in Drosophila melanogaster: influence of size and arrangement in pairs,10821178,10.1007/pl00008684,"In Drosophila melanogaster, several factors have been suggested to influence the rates of P-element transposition and excision, including position effects, size and structure of the elements and differences in transposase source. We have investigated the effect of the size of the starting P-element on the rates of excision and transposition. Four transgenes localized at the same insertion site on the X chromosome and which differ by the number of copies of an internal repeated sequence, were studied. Transgenes with sizes ranging from 11 kb to 22 kb excise at similar rates, and size does not correlate with the differences in transposition rate between them. We also studied the behavior of double P-elements, located at the same site and arranged in various configurations: nested, contiguous or separated by a few base pairs, in the same or reverse orientation. These double P-elements display different mobilities depending on the arrangement of the two transgenes. Transposition and excision rates were also studied for an insertion bearing four transgenes in very close proximity. Our results suggest that several neighboring elements could excise together. We also propose a new model to explain the formation of all the double P-elements we describe.",2000,"M Delattre, C Tatout, D Coen, M Delattre, C Tatout, D Coen"
hobo-induced rearrangements are responsible for mutation bursts at the yellow locus in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster,10778753,10.1007/s004380051176,"In 1981 recurrent local bursts of mutability of the yellow gene were observed in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster from Uman' (Ukraine). A series of y2-like mutations in the yellow gene were recovered during the period 1982 to 1991. Most of the mutants display the y2-phenotype, i.e. mutant yellow color of wings and body cuticle. Ninety-nine y2 mutants were shown to be generated by an inversion that occurred between two hobo elements, one located 129 bp from the start site of yellow transcription, and the other in the distal telomere region. The y2 phenotype was caused by the separation of the body and wing enhancers from the transcription unit. Many of the y2-like alleles were highly unstable and reverted to y+, which again, gave rise to y2-like mutants. We found that the y2-->y+-->y2 transitions were generated by repeated inversions between the two hobo elements mentioned.

"Very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases. Human ""bubblegum"" represents a new family of proteins capable of activating very long-chain fatty acids",10954726,10.1074/jbc.M006403200,"Activation by thioesterification to coenzyme A is a prerequisite for most reactions involving fatty acids. Enzymes catalyzing activation, acyl-CoA synthetases, have been classified by their chain length specificities. The most recently identified family is the very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (VLCS). Although several members of this group are capable of activating very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA), one is a bile acid-CoA synthetase, and others have been characterized as fatty acid transport proteins. It was reported that the Drosophila melanogaster mutant bubblegum (BGM) had elevated VLCFA and that the product of the defective gene had sequence homology to acyl-CoA synthetases. Therefore, we cloned full-length cDNA for a human homolog of BGM, and we investigated the properties of its protein product, hsBG, to determine whether it had VLCS activity. Northern blot analysis showed that hsBG is expressed primarily in brain. Compared with vector-transfected cells, COS-1 cells expressing hsBG had increased acyl-CoA synthetase activity with either long-chain fatty acid (2.4-fold) or VLCFA (2.6-fold) substrates. Despite this increased VLCFA activation, hsBG-expressing cells did not have increased rates of VLCFA degradation. Confocal microscopy showed that hsBG had a cytoplasmic localization in some COS-1 cells expressing the protein, whereas it appeared to associate with plasma membrane in others. Fractionation of these cells revealed that most of the hsBG-dependent acyl-CoA synthetase activity was soluble and not membrane-bound. Immunoaffinity-purified hsBG from transfected COS-1 cells was enzymatically active. hsBG and hsVLCS are only 15% identical, and comparison with sequences of two conserved motifs from all known families of acyl-CoA synthetases revealed that hsBG along with the D. melanogaster and murine homologs comprise a new family of acyl-CoA synthetases. Thus, two protein families are now known that contain enzymes capable of activating VLCFA. Because hsBG is expressed in brain but previously described VLCSs were not highly expressed in this organ, hsBG may play a central role in brain VLCFA metabolism and myelinogenesis.",2000,"S J Steinberg, J Morgenthaler, A K Heinzer, K D Smith, P A Watkins, S J Steinberg, J Morgenthaler, A K Heinzer, K D Smith, P A Watkins"
The properties of a tRNA-specific adenosine deaminase from Drosophila melanogaster support an evolutionary link between pre-mRNA editing and tRNA modification,10629039,10.1128/mcb.20.3.825-833.2000,"Pre-mRNA editing involving the conversion of adenosine to inosine is mediated by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR1 and ADAR2). ADARs contain multiple double-stranded RNA(dsRNA)-binding domains in addition to an adenosine deaminase domain. An adenosine deaminase acting on tRNAs, scTad1p (also known as scADAT1), cloned from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a deaminase domain related to the ADARs but lacks dsRNA-binding domains. We have identified a gene homologous to scADAT1 in the region of Drosophila melanogaster Adh chromosome II. Recombinant Drosophila ADAT1 (dADAT1) has been expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and purified. The enzyme has no activity on dsRNA substrates but is a tRNA deaminase with specificity for adenosine 37 of insect alanine tRNA. dADAT1 shows greater similarity to vertebrate ADARs than to yeast Tad1p, supporting the hypothesis of a common evolutionary origin for ADARs and ADATs. dAdat1 transcripts are maternally supplied in the egg.

Somatic EGFP expression was observed during early instars in approximately one-half of all G0 individuals. Two G1 individuals arising from a G0 female displayed high levels of EGFP gene expression during all stages of development. EGFP was transmitted in a Mendelian fashion to the G2 and G3 generations and molecular analysis confirmed the presence of the Hermes[actin5C:EGFP] gene in these insects.

The fru gene has seven exons spanning 15-kb encoding two transcripts with ORFs of 841 and 695 amino acids. The protein encoded by the fruA transcript is well conserved with the D. melanogaster type A protein, particularly the BTB protein-protein-binding domain, which is encoded by exons I and II and is 100% conserved. The peptide encoded by exon III has several sequence differences but these are confined mostly to regions of repetitive sequence and exons IV to VI are well conserved. The peptide encoded by exon VII is semi-conserved for the 5' end and 100% conserved for the Zinc finger domains; the rest of the peptide is virtually unconserved. The FRUA protein has a BTB domain and two zinc finger domains whereas the FRUC protein only has the BTB domain. The genomic DNA sequence encoding the BTB domain of the fru gene has been cloned from 21 species of Diptera. The protein-coding sequence is highly conserved and the amino acid sequence is identical except for two changes in the Tephritidae. The intron sequences are completely unconserved except between very closely related species such as the Hawaiian Drosophila. The phylogeny produced using the BTB exon sequences suggests that the most closely related mainland Drosophila species to the Hawaiian clade is D. moriwakii of the melanica species group. The phylogeny also shows that the Scaptomyza are closely related to the Hawaiian Drosophila so supporting a Hawaiian origin for the Scaptomyza.

Human scribble (Vartul) is targeted for ubiquitin-mediated degradation by the high-risk papillomavirus E6 proteins and the E6AP ubiquitin-protein ligase,11027293,10.1128/mcb.20.21.8244-8253.2000,"The high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 proteins stimulate the ubiquitination and degradation of p53, dependent on the E6AP ubiquitin-protein ligase. Other proteins have also been shown to be targeted for degradation by E6, including hDlg, the human homolog of the Drosophila melanogaster Discs large (Dlg) tumor suppressor. We show here that the human homolog of the Drosophila Scribble (Vartul) (hScrib) tumor suppressor protein is also targeted for ubiquitination by the E6-E6AP complex in vitro and that expression of E6 induces degradation of hScrib in vivo. Characterization of the E6AP-E6-hScrib complex indicated that hScrib binds directly to E6 and that the binding is mediated by the PDZ domains of hScrib and a carboxyl-terminal epitope conserved among the high-risk HPV E6 proteins. Green fluorescent protein-hScrib was localized to the periphery of MDCK cells, where it colocalized with ZO-1, a component of tight junctions. E6 expression resulted in loss of integrity of tight junctions, as measured by ZO-1 localization, and this effect was dependent on the PDZ binding epitope of E6. Thus, the high-risk HPV E6 proteins induce the degradation of the human homologs of two Drosophila PDZ domain-containing tumor suppressor proteins, hDlg and hScrib, both of which are associated with cell junction complexes. The fact that Scrib/Vart and Dlg appear to cooperate in a pathway that controls Drosophila epithelial cell growth suggests that the combined targeting of hScrib and hDlg is an important component of the biologic activity of high-risk HPV E6 proteins.",2000,"S Nakagawa, J M Huibregtse, S Nakagawa, J M Huibregtse"
Identification and characterization of a SUMO-1 conjugation system that modifies neuronal calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in Drosophila melanogaster,10995744,10.1074/jbc.M003949200,"Drosophila Uba2 and Ubc9 SUMO-1 conjugation enzyme homologs (DmUba2 and DmUbc9) were isolated as calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) interacting proteins by yeast two-hybrid screening of an adult head cDNA library. We found that at least one isoform of Drosophila neuronal CaMKII is conjugated to DmSUMO-1 in vivo. The interactions observed in the two-hybrid screen may therefore reflect catalytic events. To understand the role of SUMO conjugation in the brain, we undertook a characterization of the system. The other required components of the system, Drosophila Aos1 and SUMO-1 (DmAos1 and DmSUMO-1), were identified in expressed sequence tag data base searches. Purified recombinant DmUba2/DmAos1 dimer can activate DmSUMO-1 in vitro and transfer DmSUMO-1 to recombinant DmUbc9. DmSUMO-1 conjugation occurs in all developmental stages of Drosophila and in the adult central nervous system. Overexpression of a putative dominant negative DmUba2(C175S) mutant protein in the Drosophila central nervous system resulted in an increase in overall DmSUMO-1 conjugates and a base-sensitive p120 species, which is likely to be DmUba2(C175S) linked to endogenous DmSUMO-1 through an oxygen ester bond. Overexpression of DmUba2(wt) protein in vivo also led to increased levels of DmSUMO-1 conjugates. High level overexpression of either DmUba2(wt) or DmUba2(C175S) in the Drosophila central nervous system caused pupal and earlier stage lethality. Expression in the developing eye led to a rough eye phenotype with retinal degeneration.

Latitudinal variation for two enzyme loci and an inversion polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster from Central and South America,10937196,,"Many organisms show latitudinal variation for various genetically determined traits. Such clines may involve neutral variation and originate from historical events or their maintenance may be explained by selection. For Drosophila melanogaster, latitudinal variation for allozymes, inversions, and quantitative traits has been found on several continents. We sampled D. melanogaster populations in Panama and along a transect of 40 latitudinal degrees on the west coast of South America. Negative correlations with latitude were found for AdhS and alpha GpdhF allele frequencies and for the frequency of the cosmopolitan inversion In(2L)t in AdhS alpha GpdhF chromosomes. A positive correlation existed between wing length and latitude. Significant correlations were found between these traits and climatic variables like temperature and rainfall. The observed clines show considerable resemblance to those found on other continents. Gametic disequilibrium between AdhS and alpha GpdhF occurred predominantly at higher latitudes and was caused by the presence of In(2L)t. The reasons for the clinal distributions are discussed and it is argued that selection is the most likely explanation. However, the exact nature of the selective force and the interactions of allozymes with each other and with In(2L)t are complex and not fully understood.

However, the molecular identities of such receptors are still obscure. Here, we present data showing that Drosophila possesses at least three cDNAs encoding members of the Gram-negative bacteria-binding protein (DGNBP) family, one of which, DGNBP-1, has been characterized. Western blot, flow cytometric, and confocal laser microscopic analyses demonstrate that DGNBP-1 exists in both a soluble and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane form in culture medium supernatant and on Drosophila immunocompetent cells, respectively. DGNBP-1 has a high affinity to microbial immune elicitors such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and beta-1,3-glucan whereas no binding affinity is detected with peptidoglycan, beta-1,4-glucan, or chitin. Importantly, the overexpression of DGNBP-1 in Drosophila immunocompetent cells enhances LPS- and beta-1,3-glucan-induced innate immune gene (NF-kappaB-dependent antimicrobial peptide gene) expression, which can be specifically blocked by pretreatment with anti-DGNBP-1 antibody.

This remarkable differentiation has evolved despite small interslope distances (only 100-400 m), within easy dispersal distance. The differences between populations are those expected from genetic adaptation to local microclimates. How such differentiation could evolve and be maintained despite the likelihood of genetic exchange between populations is a challenging question. We hypothesized that interslope microclimatic differences caused strong differential selection for stress tolerance, accompanied by behavioral differentiation (habitat choice and reduced migration rate), reinforced by sexual isolation.

The Dictyostelium homologue of mammalian soluble adenylyl cyclase encodes a guanylyl cyclase,11500361,10.1093/emboj/20.16.4341,"A new Dictyostelium discoideum cyclase gene was identified that encodes a protein (sGC) with 35% similarity to mammalian soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC). Gene disruption of sGC has no effect on adenylyl cyclase activity and results in a >10-fold reduction in guanylyl cyclase activity. The scg- null mutants show reduced chemotactic sensitivity and aggregate poorly under stringent conditions. With Mn(2+)/GTP as substrate, most of the sGC activity is soluble, but with the more physiological Mg(2+)/GTP the activity is detected in membranes and stimulated by GTPgammaS. Unexpectedly, orthologues of sGC and sAC are present in bacteria and vertebrates, but absent from Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",2001,"J Roelofs, M Meima, P Schaap, P J Van Haastert, J Roelofs, M Meima, P Schaap, P J Van Haastert"
Reduced enzyme activity following Hsp70 overexpression in Drosophila melanogaster,11444022,10.1023/a:1002701420091,"Acclimation to environmental change can impose costs to organisms. One potential cost is the change in cell metabolism that follows a physiological response, e.g., high expression of heat shock proteins may alter specific activity of important enzymes. We examined the significance of this cost in a pair of Drosophila melanogaster lines transformed with additional copies of a gene that encodes the heat shock protein, Hsp70. Heat shock induces Hsp70 expression in all lines, but lines with extra copies produce much more Hsp70 than do excision control strains. The consequence of this supranormal Hsp70 expression is to reduce specific activity of both enzymes analyzed, adult alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which is heat sensitive, and lactate dehydrogenase, which is not. Strain differences were most pronounced under those conditions where Hsp70 expression was maximized, and not where the heat stress denatured proteins. That result supported the idea that Hsp70 expression is constrained evolutionarily by its tendency to bind nascent peptides when overabundant within the cell.",2001,"R A Krebs, S H Holbrook, R A Krebs, S H Holbrook"

Fish retroposons related to the Penelope element of Drosophila virilis define a new group of retrotransposable elements,11459192,10.1007/s004380100468,"Poseidon and Neptune are two ancient lineages of retroposons related to the Penelope element from Drosophila virilis. They have been identified in various teleost fish species, including the medakafish (Oryzias latipes), and the pufferfishes Fugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis, whose genomes are currently being sequenced. Some of these elements are highly reiterated in fish genomes. Penelope-related elements were also identified in blood fluke, shrimp, sea urchin, cichlid fish and frog, showing that they are widespread in animals. Penelope-related retroposons were not detected among sequences from the Drosophila melanogaster and human genome projects, suggesting that they have been lost from certain animal lineages. A sequence encoding a putative Uri (also called GIY-YIG) endonuclease domain was detected downstream from the gene for reverse transcriptase. To the best of our knowledge, this type of endonuclease sequence has previously been identified in group I introns and in genes for prokaryotic excinucleases but not in retrotransposable elements. Penelope-related elements are frequently truncated at their 5' ends and can also be flanked by long terminal repeat-like structures. Phylogenetic analysis of the reverse transcriptase domain failed to assign Penelope-related retroposons to one of the major groups of retroelements. Overall, therefore, the evidence strongly suggests that these sequences represent a new group of retrotransposable elements.",2001,"J N Volff, U Hornung, M Schartl, J N Volff, U Hornung, M Schartl"
Electron microscope mapping of the pericentric and intercalary heterochromatic regions of the polytene chromosomes of the mutant Suppressor of underreplication in Drosophila melanogaster,11862456,10.1007/s004120100164,"Breaks and ectopic contacts in the heterochromatic regions of Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes are the manifestations of the cytological effects of DNA underreplication. Their appearance makes these regions difficult to map. The Su(UR)ES gene, which controls the phenomenon, has been described recently. Mutation of this locus gives rise to new blocks of material in the pericentric heterochromatic regions and causes the disappearance of breaks and ectopic contacts in the intercalary heterochromatic regions, thereby making the banding pattern distinct and providing better opportunities for mapping of the heterochromatic regions in polytene chromosomes. Here, we present the results of an electron microscope study of the heterochromatic regions. In the wild-type salivary glands, the pericentric regions correspond to the beta-heterochromatin and do not show the banding pattern. The most conspicuous cytological effect of the Su(UR)ES mutation is the formation of a large banded chromosome fragment comprising at least 25 bands at the site where the 3L and 3R proximal arms connect. In the other pericentric regions, 20CF, 40BF and 41BC, 15, 12 and 9 new bands were revealed, respectively. A large block of densely packed material appears in the most proximal part of the fourth chromosome. An electron microscope analysis of 26 polytene chromosome regions showing the characteristic features of intercalary heterochromatin was also performed.

Cultured cells were cotransfected with reporter plasmids and dsRNA. The inhibitor effect on reporter gene expression depended on the extent of homology between dsRNA and the target gene. RNA interference was also studied in cells cotransfected with plasmids directing synthesis of sense and antisense RNAs. Production of antisense RNA only slightly inhibited expression of the reporter gene. Simultaneous expression of both sense and antisense RNAs from a special plasmid did not inhibit expression of the reporter construct.,2001,"A A Aravin, V V Vagin, Ia M RozovskiÄ­, V A Gvozdev, A A Aravin, V V Vagin, Ia M RozovskiÄ­, V A Gvozdev"

The literature data on the structure and functions of genes TAP in humans and Mex67 in yeast are discussed. These genes are orthologous to the sbr gene of Drosophila and control mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The literature evidence is consistent with the recessive expression of mutation l(1)ts403 (sbr10) upon heat treatment that is manifested as impaired HSP synthesis at the posttranscriptional level. However, it fails to explain the semidominant effect of the mutation manifested in high frequency of meiotic sex-chromosome nondisjunction in heat-treated females.

Does the difference in the timing of eclosion of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster reflect differences in the circadian organization?,11587084,10.1081/cbi-100106075,"The eclosion rhythm of a laboratory population of Drosophila melanogaster was studied under 12h light, 12h dark (LD 12:12) cycles. Although most of the flies were found to eclose just after ""lights on"" in LD 12:12, termed within gate (WG) flies, a few flies were found to eclose nearly 10h after peak eclosion, termed outside gate (OG) flies. The circadian parameters of the clocks controlling oviposition rhythms in the WG and the OG flies were estimated to understand the cause of such differences in the timing of eclosion. The distribution of the fraction of individual flies exhibiting single, multiple, and no significant period in the WG flies was significantly different from distribution in the OG flies. Compared to the WG flies, more OG flies were found to exhibit oviposition rhythm with multiple periodicity, whereas more WG flies exhibited an oviposition rhythm with a single significant period. The fraction of flies with arrhythmic oviposition was similar in both the WG and the OG flies. Free-running period tau in constant darkness (DD) and the phase angle difference psi in LD 12:12 for the oviposition rhythm of WG and OG flies were significantly different. These results suggest that the differences in the time of eclosion between the flies eclosing within the gate and outside the gate of eclosion are probably due to differences in the circadian system controlling eclosion, which is reflected by the differences in their oviposition rhythm.",2001,"V Sheeba, M Nihal, S J Mathew, N M Swamy, M K Chandrashekaran, A Joshi, V K Sharma, V Sheeba, M Nihal, S J Mathew, N M Swamy, M K Chandrashekaran, A Joshi, V K Sharma"

Not surprisingly, both the Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila genomes contain a conserved repertoire of neuronal signaling proteins that are also present in mammals. This includes a large number of neuronal cell adhesion receptors, synapse-organizing proteins, ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors, and synaptic vesicle-trafficking proteins. In addition, there are a significant number of fly homologs of human neurological disease loci, suggesting that Drosophila is likely to be an important disease model for human neuropathology in the near future.

Expression and function of the Drosophila ACT88F actin isoform is not restricted to the indirect flight muscles,11519734,10.1023/a:1010308326890,"Most higher eukaryotic genomes contain multiple actin genes, yet the sequence differences between isoforms are few. In Drosophila melanogaster it was previously established that one of the six actin genes, Act88F, is expressed only in the indirect flight muscles (IFMs). These muscles are highly specialised for oscillatory contractions to power flight. The implication was that this isoform had tissue-specific properties. In this paper we show using two reporter constructs expressing either beta-galactosidase, Act88F-lacZ, or the green fluorescent protein, Act88F-GFP, that the Act88F promoter is active in a small number of other muscles, including leg (femoral) and uterine muscles. However, the levels of Act88F driven non-IFM expression are much less than in the IFMs. We have confirmed endogenous Act88F gene expression in these other muscles by in situ hybridisation studies. Using null and antimorphic mutants to show decreased walking ability and delayed/reduced oviposition we demonstrated that Act88F expression is functionally important in multiple muscle groups. Since the mutant effects are mild, this supports the expectation that other actin genes are also expressed in these muscles. The Act88F-GFP promoter-reporter also detects Act88F-driven expression in the bristle-forming cells in the pupal wings. The implications of these results for the functions and developmental expression of the Drosophila ACT88F isoform are discussed.",2001,"U Nongthomba, S Pasalodos-Sanchez, S Clark, J D Clayton, J C Sparrow, U Nongthomba, S Pasalodos-Sanchez, S Clark, J D Clayton, J C Sparrow"
Developmental regulation and complex organization of the promoter of the non-coding hsr(omega) gene of Drosophila melanogaster,11255511,10.1007/BF02708978,"The nucleus-limited large non-coding hsr(omega)-n RNA product of the 93D or the hsr(omega) gene of Drosophila melanogaster binds to a variety of RNA-binding proteins involved in nuclear RNA processing. We examined the developmental and heat shock induced expression of this gene by in situ hybridization of nonradioactively labelled riboprobe to cellular transcripts in intact embryos, larval and adult somatic tissues of wild type and an enhancer-trap line carrying the hsr(omega) 05241 allele due to insertion of a P-LacZ-rosy+ transposon at -130 bp position of the hsr(omega) promoter. We also examined LacZ expression in the enhancer-trap line and in two transgenic lines carrying different lengths of the hsr(omega) promoter upstream of the LacZ reporter. The hsr(omega) gene is expressed widely at all developmental stages; in later embryonic stages, its expression in the developing central nervous system was prominent. In spite of insertion of a big transposon in the promoter, expression of the hsr(omega) 05241 allele in the enhancer-trap line, as revealed by in situ hybridization to hsr(omega) transcripts in cells, was similar to that of the wild type allele in all the embryonic, larval and adult somatic tissues examined. Expression of the LacZ gene in this enhancer-trap line was similar to that of the hsr(omega) RNA in all diploid cell types in embryos and larvae but in the polytene cells, the LacZ gene did not express at all, neither during normal development nor after heat shock. Comparison of the expression patterns of hsr(omega) gene and those of the LacZ reporter gene under its various promoter regions in the enhancer-trap and transgenic lines revealed a complex pattern of regulation, which seems to be essential for its dynamically varying expression in diverse cell types.",2001,"S C Lakhotia, T K Rajendra, K V Prasanth, S C Lakhotia, T K Rajendra, K V Prasanth"
A new approach reveals syncytia within the visceral musculature of Drosophila melanogaster,11493568,,"In order to reveal syncytia within the visceral musculature of Drosophila melanogaster, we have combined the GAL4/UAS system with the single-cell transplantation technique. After transplantation of single cells from UAS-GFP donor embryos into ubiquitously GAL4-expressing recipients, the expression of the reporter gene was exclusively activated in syncytia containing both donor- and recipient-derived nuclei. In the first trial, we tested the system in the larval somatic musculature, which is already known to consist of syncytia. By this means we could show that most of the larval somatic muscles are generated by clonally non-related cells. Moreover, using this approach we were able to detect syncytia within the visceral musculature - a tissue that has previously been described as consisting of mononuclear cells. Both the longitudinal visceral musculature of the midgut and the circular musculature of the hindgut consist of syncytia and persist through metamorphosis. This novel application of the transplantation technique might be a powerful tool to trace syncytia in any organism using the GAL4/UAS system.",2001,"R Klapper, S Heuser, T Strasser, W Janning, R Klapper, S Heuser, T Strasser, W Janning"
SNARE-dependent signaling at the Drosophila wing margin,11356016,10.1006/dbio.2001.0228,"The wing of Drosophila melanogaster has long been used as a model system to characterize intermolecular interactions important in development. Implicit in our understanding of developmental processes is the proper trafficking and sorting of signaling molecules, although the precise mechanisms that regulate membrane trafficking in a developmental context are not well studied. We have therefore chosen the Drosophila wing to assess the importance of SNARE-dependent membrane trafficking during development. N-Ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) is a key component of the membrane-trafficking machinery and we constructed a mutant form of NSF whose expression we directed to the developing wing margin. This resulted in a notched-wing phenotype, the severity of which was enhanced when combined with mutants of VAMP/Synaptobrevin or Syntaxin, indicating that it results from impaired membrane trafficking. Importantly, we find that the phenotype is also enhanced by mutations in genes for wingless and components of the Notch signaling pathway, suggesting that these signaling pathways were disrupted. Finally, we used this phenotype to conduct a screen for interacting genes, uncovering two Notch pathway components that had not previously been linked to wing development. We conclude that SNARE-mediated membrane trafficking is an important component of wing margin development and that dosage-sensitive developmental pathways will act as a sensitive reporter of partial membrane-trafficking disruption.",2001,"B A Stewart, M Mohtashami, L Zhou, W S Trimble, G L Boulianne, B A Stewart, M Mohtashami, L Zhou, W S Trimble, G L Boulianne"
Recombinagenic activity of four compounds in the standard and high bioactivation crosses of Drosophila melanogaster in the wing spot test,11507237,10.1093/mutage/16.5.385,"The wing somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) using Drosophila melanogaster was employed to determine the recombinagenic and mutagenic activity of four chemicals in an in vivo eukaryotic system. Two different crosses involving the wing cell markers mwh and flr(3) were used: the standard cross and a high bioactivation cross. The high bioactivation cross is characterized by a high constitutive level of cytochromes P450 which leads to an increased sensitivity to a number of promutagens and procarcinogens. Three-day-old larvae derived from both crosses were treated chronically with the oxidizing agent potassium chromate and with the three procarcinogens cyclophosphamide, p-dimethylaminoazobenzene and 9,10-dimethylanthracene. From both crosses two types of progeny were obtained: marker-heterozygous and balancer-heterozygous. The wings of both genotypes were analysed for the occurrence of single and twin spots expressing the mwh and/or flr(3) mutant phenotypes. In the marker-heterozygous genotype the spots can be due either to mitotic recombination or to mutation. In contrast, in the balancer-heterozygous genotype only mutational events lead to spot formation, all recombination events being eliminated. The oxidizing agent potassium chromate was equally and highly genotoxic in both crosses. Surprisingly, the promutagen cyclophosphamide also showed equal genotoxicity in both crosses, whereas p-dimethylaminoazobenzene was negative in the standard cross, but clearly genotoxic in the high bioactivation cross. 9,10-Dimethylanthracene showed a rather weak genotoxicity in the high bioactivation cross. Analyses of the dose-response relationships for mwh clones recorded in the two wing genotypes demonstrated that all four compounds are recombinagenic. The fraction of all genotoxic events which are due to mitotic recombination ranged from 83% (9,10-dimethylanthracene) to 99% (p-dimethylaminoazobenzene). These results demonstrate that the wing spot test in Drosophila is most suited to the detection of recombinagenic activity of genotoxic chemicals.",2001,"M A SpanÃ³, H Frei, F E WÃ¼rgler, U Graf, M A SpanÃ³, H Frei, F E WÃ¼rgler, U Graf"
Substitution rates in Drosophila nuclear genes: implications for translational selection,11139510,,"The relationships between synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates and between synonymous rate and codon usage bias are important to our understanding of the roles of mutation and selection in the evolution of Drosophila genes. Previous studies used approximate estimation methods that ignore codon bias. In this study we reexamine those relationships using maximum-likelihood methods to estimate substitution rates, which accommodate the transition/transversion rate bias and codon usage bias. We compiled a sample of homologous DNA sequences at 83 nuclear loci from Drosophila melanogaster and at least one other species of Drosophila. Our analysis was consistent with previous studies in finding that synonymous rates were positively correlated with nonsynonymous rates. Our analysis differed from previous studies, however, in that synonymous rates were unrelated to codon bias. We therefore conducted a simulation study to investigate the differences between approaches. The results suggested that failure to properly account for multiple substitutions at the same site and for biased codon usage by approximate methods can lead to an artifactual correlation between synonymous rate and codon bias. Implications of the results for translational selection are discussed.",2001,"K A Dunn, J P Bielawski, Z Yang, K A Dunn, J P Bielawski, Z Yang"
Drosophila RNase H1 is essential for development but not for proliferation,11523794,10.1007/s004380100483,"Ribonucleases H (RNases H) recognize and specifically degrade RNA that is bound to complementary DNA and are thought to be involved in DNA replication and transcriptional regulation.

Here, we report the characterization of the first loss-of-function mutation in an RNase H1 gene in a metazoan organism, Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic studies of this mutant showed that this gene is essential for metamorphosis in Drosophila. However, disruption of the RNase H1 gene does not affect proliferation, but probably alters the regulation of gene expression. The lethal phenotype of this mutant also demonstrates that RNase H1 activity in Drosophila cannot be provided by other cellular RNase H activities. Analysis of the developmental and spatial expression profiles of a reporter gene placed under the control of the RNase H1 promoter revealed increased expression in several larval tissues. In salivary glands this increase was shown to be inducible by treatment with ecdysone.",2001,"V Filippov, M Filippov, S S Gill, V Filippov, M Filippov, S S Gill"

However, none of these enzymes have been characterized completely. The present data show that the wild-type genes of two members of the Halloween family of embryonic lethals, disembodied (dib) and shadow (sad), code for mitochondrial cytochromes P450 that mediate the last two hydroxylation reactions in the ecdysteroidogenic pathway in Drosophila, namely the C22- and C2-hydroxylases. When sad (CYP315A1) is transfected into Drosophila S2 cells, the cells metabolize 2-deoxyecdysone (2dE) to E and the [3H]ketotriol (2,22-dideoxyecdysone) to 22-deoxyecdysone. In contrast, dib (CYP302A1) is responsible for the conversion of the [3H]ketotriol to [3H]2dE. When cells are transfected with both dib and sad, they metabolize the [3H]ketotriol to [3H]E in high yield. The expression of sad and dib is concentrated within the individual segments of the developing epidermis when there is a surge of ecdysteroid midway through embryogenesis. This result occurs before the ring gland has developed and suggests that the embryonic epidermis is a site of ecdysteroid biosynthesis. This pattern then diminishes, and, during late embryogenesis, expression of both genes is concentrated in the prothoracic gland cells of the developing ring gland. Expression of dib and sad continues to be localized in this endocrine compartment during larval development, being maximal in both the late second and third instar larvae, about the time of the premolt peaks in the ecdysteroid titer.",2002,"James T Warren, Anna Petryk, Guillermo Marques, Michael Jarcho, Jean-Philippe Parvy, Chantal Dauphin-Villemant, Michael B O'Connor, Lawrence I Gilbert, James T Warren, Anna Petryk, Guillermo Marques, Michael Jarcho, Jean-Philippe Parvy, Chantal Dauphin-Villemant, Michael B O'Connor, Lawrence I Gilbert"

The Dh gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a diuretic peptide that acts through cyclic AMP,12432004,,"Dh, the gene that encodes a CRF-like peptide in Drosophila melanogaster, is described. The product of this gene is a 44-amino-acid peptide (Drome-DH(44)) with a sequence almost identical to the Musca domestica and Stomoxys calcitrans diuretic hormones. There are no other similar peptides encoded within the known Drosophila genomic sequence. Functional studies showed that the deduced peptide stimulated fluid production, and that this effect was mediated by cyclic AMP in principal cells only: there was no effect on the levels of either cyclic GMP or intracellular calcium. Stimulation also elevated levels of cyclic AMP (but not cyclic GMP) phosphodiesterase, a new mode of action for this class of hormone. The transcript was localised by in situ hybridisation, and the peptide by immunocytochemistry, to two groups of three neurones in the pars intercerebralis within the brain.

"The Drosophila slamdance gene: a mutation in an aminopeptidase can cause seizure, paralysis and neuronal failure",12454073,,"We report here the characterization of slamdance (sda), a Drosophila melanogaster ""bang-sensitive"" (BS) paralytic mutant. This mutant exhibits hyperactive behavior and paralysis following a mechanical ""bang"" or electrical shock. Electrophysiological analyses have shown that this mutant is much more prone to seizure episodes than normal flies because it has a drastically lowered seizure threshold. Through genetic mapping, molecular cloning, and RNA interference, we have demonstrated that the sda phenotype can be attributed to a mutation in the Drosophila homolog of the human aminopeptidase N (APN) gene. Furthermore, using mRNA in situ hybridization and LacZ staining, we have found that the sda gene is expressed specifically in the central nervous system at particular developmental stages. Together, these results suggest that the bang sensitivity in sda mutants is caused by a defective APN gene that somehow increases seizure susceptibility. Finally, by using the sda mutation as a sensitized background, we have been able to identify a rich variety of sda enhancers and other independent BS mutations.",2002,"HaiGuang Zhang, Jeff Tan, Elaine Reynolds, Daniel Kuebler, Sally Faulhaber, Mark Tanouye, HaiGuang Zhang, Jeff Tan, Elaine Reynolds, Daniel Kuebler, Sally Faulhaber, Mark Tanouye"
ACK family tyrosine kinase activity is a component of Dcdc42 signaling during dorsal closure in Drosophila melanogaster,11997505,10.1128/mcb.22.11.3685-3697.2002,"We have characterized Drosophila melanogaster ACK (DACK), one of two members of the ACK family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases in Drosophila. The ACKs are likely effectors for the small GTPase Cdc42, but signaling by these proteins remains poorly defined. ACK family tyrosine kinase activity functions downstream of Drosophila Cdc42 during dorsal closure of the embryo, as overexpression of DACK can rescue the dorsal closure defects caused by dominant-negative Dcdc42. Similar to known participants in dorsal closure, DACK is enriched in the leading edge cells of the advancing epidermis, but it does not signal through activation of the Jun amino-terminal kinase cascade operating in these cells. Transcription of DACK is responsive to changes in Dcdc42 signaling specifically at the leading edge and in the amnioserosa, two tissues involved in dorsal closure. Unlike other members of the ACK family, DACK does not contain a conserved Cdc42-binding motif, and transcriptional regulation may be one route by which Dcdc42 can affect DACK function. Expression of wild-type and kinase-dead DACK transgenes in embryos, and in the developing wing and eye, reveals that ACK family tyrosine kinase activity is involved in a range of developmental events similar to that of Dcdc42.",2002,"Kai Ping Sem, Baharak Zahedi, Ivan Tan, Maria Deak, Louis Lim, Nicholas Harden, Kai Ping Sem, Baharak Zahedi, Ivan Tan, Maria Deak, Louis Lim, Nicholas Harden"
"Sexual signaling and speciation, a microevolutionary perspective",12555779,,"Despite the growing evidence that sexual selection can drive speciation, the evolution of sexual signals in natural populations is far from being well-understood. Sexual signals evolve in response to a variety of factors. Some of the most important selective factors are conspecifics, transmission efficiency in a particular environment, detection by predators, and phylogenetic constraints. These factors have been addressed quite successfully in studies of single types of signals in both vertebrates and invertebrates. However, it is less clear how multimodal signals evolve because the factors listed above will act on every component of the signaling system, and the relative weights of each type of signal must be taken into account. Species of Drosophila are excellent for such analyses because they are amenable to both phenotypic experimentation and genetic manipulation. This paper presents an approach that involves two analyses: studies of which signals are sexually selected within a species, and parallel studies of the signals that are involved in behavioral isolation between closely related species. If the same signal characteristics are involved in both processes, they would provide support for the hypothesis that sexual selection can drive speciation. This approach is illustrated with studies of Hawaiian Drosophila and a review of signals that could be sexually selected in Drosophila melanogaster.",2002,"Christine R B Boake, Christine R B Boake"

Nucleotide and repeat length variation at the nonA gene of the Drosophila virilis group species and its effects on male courtship song,12403170,10.1023/a:1020102602268,"Genes found to affect male courtship song characters in Drosophila melanogaster are good candidates when tracing genes responsible for species-specific songs in other Drosophila species. It has previously been shown that Thr-Gly repeat length variation at the period gene affects song traits in D. melanogaster, which gives the repetitive regions a special interest. In this work, we have characterised the patterns of nucleotide variation for gene regions containing two Gly and one Gln-Ala repeat in another D. melanogaster song gene, no-on-transient A, in D. virilis group species. The levels of nucleotide variability in D. virilis nonA were similar to those found for other genes of the species, and the gene sequences showed no signs of deviation from neutrality. The Gly 2 repeat preceding the central domain of the gene exhibited length variation, which did not, however, correlate with song variation either within D. virilis or between the species of D. virilis group. The Gly 3 repeat located on the other side of the central domain showed amino acid divergence parallel to the consensus phylogeny of the D. virilis group species. The species of the virilis subgroup having Asn after the first three glycines in this repeat have simple songs with no species-specificity, while the species of the montana subgroup having two Gly or Asn-Ser in this site have unique courtship songs. Amino acid differences between the species in this repeat may, however, reflect species phylogeny rather than have an effect on song divergence per se.",2002,"Susanna Huttunen, Jorge Vieira, Anneli Hoikkala, Susanna Huttunen, Jorge Vieira, Anneli Hoikkala"
Determination of the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region oligosaccharide structures of proteoglycans from Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans,12058048,10.1074/jbc.M205078200,"Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster are relevant models for studying the roles of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) during the development of multicellular organisms. The genome projects of these organisms have revealed the existence of multiple genes related to GAG-synthesizing enzymes. Although the putative genes encoding the enzymes that synthesize the GAG-protein linkage region have also been identified, there is no direct evidence that the GAG chains bind covalently to core proteins. This study aimed to clarify whether GAG chains in these organisms are linked to core proteins through the conventional linkage region tetrasaccharide sequence found in vertebrates and whether modifications by phosphorylation and sulfation reported for vertebrates are present also in invertebrates. The linkage region oligosaccharides were isolated from C. elegans chondroitin in addition to D. melanogaster heparan and chondroitin sulfate after digestion with the respective bacterial eliminases and were then derivatized with a fluorophore 2-aminobenzamide. Their structures were characterized by gel filtration and anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography in conjunction with enzymatic digestion and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectrometry, which demonstrated a uniform linkage tetrasaccharide structure of -GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl- or -GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl(2-O-phosphate)- for C. elegans chondroitin and D. melanogaster CS, respectively. In contrast, the unmodified and phosphorylated counterparts were demonstrated in heparan sulfate of adult flies at a molar ratio of 73:27, and in that of the immortalized D. melanogaster S2 cell line at a molar ratio of 7:93, which suggests that the linkage region in the fruit fly first becomes phosphorylated uniformly on the Xyl residue and then dephosphorylated. It has been established here that GAG chains in both C. elegans and D. melanogaster are synthesized on the core protein through the ubiquitous linkage region tetrasaccharide sequence, suggesting that indispensable functions of the linkage region in the GAG synthesis have been well conserved during evolution.",2002,"Shuhei Yamada, Yukihiko Okada, Momoyo Ueno, Satomi Iwata, S S Deepa, Shuji Nishimura, Masaki Fujita, Irma Van Die, Yoshio Hirabayashi, Kazuyuki Sugahara, Shuhei Yamada, Yukihiko Okada, Momoyo Ueno, Satomi Iwata, S S Deepa, Shuji Nishimura, Masaki Fujita, Irma Van Die, Yoshio Hirabayashi, Kazuyuki Sugahara"
A novel acetylcholinesterase gene in mosquitoes codes for the insecticide target and is non-homologous to the ace gene in Drosophila,12396499,10.1098/rspb.2002.2122,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the target of two major insecticide families, organophosphates (OPs) and carbamates. AChE insensitivity is a frequent resistance mechanism in insects and responsible mutations in the ace gene were identified in two Diptera, Drosophila melanogaster and Musca domestica. However, for other insects, the ace gene cloned by homology with Drosophila does not code for the insensitive AChE in resistant individuals, indicating the existence of a second ace locus. We identified two AChE loci in the genome of Anopheles gambiae, one (ace-1) being a new locus and the other (ace-2) being homologous to the gene previously described in Drosophila. The gene ace-1 has no obvious homologue in the Drosophila genome and was found in 15 mosquito species investigated. In An. gambiae, ace-1 and ace-2 display 53% similarity at the amino acid level and an overall phylogeny indicates that they probably diverged before the differentiation of insects. Thus, both genes are likely to be present in the majority of insects and the absence of ace-1 in Drosophila is probably due to a secondary loss. In one mosquito (Culex pipiens), ace-1 was found to be tightly linked with insecticide resistance and probably encodes the AChE OP target. These results have important implications for the design of new insecticides, as the target AChE is thus encoded by distinct genes in different insect groups, even within the Diptera: ace-2 in at least the Drosophilidae and Muscidae and ace-1 in at least the Culicidae.

Transrepression of AP-1 by nuclear receptors in Drosophila,12049770,10.1016/s0925-4773(02)00116-8,"Mammalian cell culture studies have shown that several members of the nuclear receptor super family such as glucocorticoid receptor, retinoic acid receptor and thyroid hormone receptor can repress the activity of AP-1 proteins by a mechanism that does not require the nuclear receptor to bind to DNA directly, but that is otherwise poorly understood. Several aspects of nuclear receptor function are believed to rely on this inhibitory mechanism, which is referred to as transrepression. This study presents evidence that nuclear receptor-mediated transrepression of AP-1 occurs in Drosophila melanogaster. In two different developmental situations, embryonic dorsal closure and wing development, several nuclear receptors, including Seven up, Tailless, and Eagle antagonize AP-1. The inhibitory interactions with nuclear receptors are integrated with other modes of AP-1 regulation, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling.

One of the cloned genes, hclA (synonyms: HisCl-alpha1; HisCl2), corresponds to ort (ora transientless), mutationsin which affect synaptic transmission in the Drosophila visual system. We identified a mutational change (a null mutation) in the genomic and RNA copies of hclA derived from mutants carrying the ort(1) allele. This correlates with new phenotypes observed in the mutant strain. We found hypersensitivity to the avermectin neurotoxins in both the ort(1) adult flies and third instar larvae compared to Oregon R wild-type animals. On the other hand, the mutation makes both male and female adult flies more resistant to treatment with diethyl ether, and the animals show substantially prolonged recovery from paralysis after diethylether anaesthesia, as well as from paralysis after mechanical shock, as revealed by the bang sensitivity test. Altogether, our data give direct evidence that in vivo a HCLA subunit-containing receptor has a distinct role in the neurotoxic action of the avermectins. They also provide new evidence for a function in the response to diethylether anaesthesia and, moreover, that HCLA function is not limited to the visual system.",2002,"Mladen Iovchev, Plamen Kodrov, Adrian J Wolstenholme, William L Pak, Eugene P Semenov, Mladen Iovchev, Plamen Kodrov, Adrian J Wolstenholme, William L Pak, Eugene P Semenov"

In this study, we took systematic steps to examine various types of Mediator complexes in Drosophila melanogaster. Such efforts led to the identification of three distinct forms of Mediator complexes. In exploring their compositional and functional heterogeneity, we found that the smallest complex (C1) is highly enriched in a certain type of Drosophila cells and possesses novel Mediator proteins. The subunits shared among the three Mediator complexes (C1, C2, and C3) appear to form a stable modular structure that serves as a binding surface for transcriptional activator proteins.

Tracheal cells stop to divide early in the process of tracheogenesis and the formation of the interconnected network requires highly controlled cell migration events and cell shape changes. A number of genes involved in these two processes have been identified but in order to obtain a more complete view of branching morphogenesis, many more genes carrying essential functions have to be isolated and characterized. Here, we provide a progress report on our attempts to identify further genes expressed in the tracheal system. We show that empty spiracles (ems), a head gap gene, is required for the formation of a specific tracheal branch, the visceral branch.

Abdominal epidermal cells that are mutant for Dm myb proliferate more slowly than wild-type controls throughout pupation, with particularly sluggish progression through the early stages of mitosis. Abnormal mitoses associated with multiple functional centrosomes, unequal chromosome segregation, formation of micronuclei, and/or failure to complete cell division are common in the later cell cycles of mutant cells. Resulting nuclei are often aneuploid and/or polyploid. Similar defects have also been observed in loss-of-function mutations of the tumor suppressor genes p53, Brca1 and Brca2.

Cell-autonomous rescue experiments showed that Sema-1a is involved in assembly of a central synapse and that it is required both pre- and postsynaptically. We also found that pre- but not postsynaptic gain-of-function Sema-1a was able to disrupt the GF-motor neuron synapse and that the phenotype depended on a proline-rich intracellular domain that contains a putative Enabled binding site.

Comparative and functional studies of Drosophila species invasion by the gypsy endogenous retrovirus,11805056,,"Gypsy is an endogenous retrovirus of Drosophila melanogaster.

The ability of gypsy to invade the genome of a new species is conditioned by its capacity to be expressed in the naive genome. The genetic basis for the regulation of gypsy activity in D. melanogaster is now well known, and it has been assigned to an X-linked gene called flamenco.

We have identified several hephaestus mutations that map to a gene encoding a predicted RNA-binding protein highly related to human polypyrimidine tract binding protein and Xenopus laevis 60 kDa Vg1 mRNA-binding protein. Polypyrimidine tract binding proteins play diverse roles in RNA processing including the subcellular localization of mRNAs, translational control, internal ribosome entry site use, and the regulation of alternate exon selection. The analysis of gene expression in imaginal discs and adult cuticle of genetic mosaic animals supports a role for hephaestus in Notch signalling. Somatic clones lacking hephaestus express the Notch target genes wingless and cut, induce ectopic wing margin in adjacent wild-type tissue, inhibit wing-vein formation and have increased levels of Notch intracellular domain immunoreactivity. Clones mutant for both Delta and hephaestus have the characteristic loss-of-function thick vein phenotype of DELTA: These results lead to the hypothesis that hephaestus is required to attenuate Notch activity following its activation by Delta.

Role of trehalose phosphate synthase in anoxia tolerance and development in Drosophila melanogaster,11719513,10.1074/jbc.M109479200,"Recent studies have shown that trehalose plays a protective role in yeast in a variety of stresses, including heat, freezing and thawing, dehydration, hyperosmotic shock, and oxidant injury. Because (a) heat shock and anoxia share mechanisms that allow organisms to survive, (b) Drosophila melanogaster is tolerant to anoxia, and (c) trehalose is present in flies and is metabolically active, we asked whether trehalose can protect against anoxic stress. Here we report on a new role of trehalose in anoxia resistance in Drosophila. We first cloned the gene trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (tps1), which synthesizes trehalose, and examined the effect of tps1 overexpression as well as mutation on the resistance of Drosophila to anoxia. Upon induction of tps1, trehalose increased, and this was associated with increased tolerance to anoxia. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that trehalose reduced protein aggregation caused by anoxia. Homozygous tps1 mutant (P-element insertion into the third intron of the gene) leads to lethality at an early larval stage, and excision of the P-element rescues totally the phenotype. We conclude that trehalose contributes to anoxia tolerance in flies; this protection is likely to be due to a reduction of protein aggregation.",2002,"Qiaofang Chen, Enbo Ma, Kevin L Behar, Tian Xu, Gabriel G Haddad, Qiaofang Chen, Enbo Ma, Kevin L Behar, Tian Xu, Gabriel G Haddad"
Sperm competitive ability and genetic relatedness in Drosophila melanogaster: similarity breeds contempt,12389723,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb00192.x,"Offspring of close relatives often suffer severe fitness consequences. Previous studies have demonstrated that females, when given a choice, will choose to avoid mating with closely related males. But where opportunities for mate choice are limited or kin recognition is absent, precopulatory mechanisms may not work. In this case, either sex could reduce the risks of inbreeding through mechanisms that occur during or after copulation. During mating, males or females could commit fewer gametes when mating with a close relative. After mating, females could offset the effects of mating with a closely related male through cryptic choice. Few prior studies of sperm competition have examined the effect of genetic similarity, however, and what studies do exist have yielded equivocal results. In an effort to resolve this issue, we measured the outcome of sperm competition when female Drosophila melanogaster were mated to males of four different degrees of genetic relatedness and then to a standardized competitor.

This anomalous plateau in late-life mortality has been explained theoretically in two ways: (1) as a strictly demographic result of heterogeneity in life-long robustness between individuals within cohorts, and (2) as an evolutionary result of the plateau in the force of natural selection after the end of reproduction. Here we test the latter theory using cohorts of Drosophila melanogaster cultured with different ages of reproduction for many generations. We show in two independent comparisons that populations that evolve with early truncation of reproduction exhibit earlier onset of mortality-rate plateaus, in conformity with evolutionary theory. In addition, we test two population genetic mechanisms that may be involved in the evolution of late-life mortality: mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy. We test mutation accumulation by crossing genetically divergent, yet demographically identical, populations, testing for hybrid vigor between the hybrid and nonhybrid parental populations. We found no difference between the hybrid and nonhybrid populations in late-life mortality rates, a result that does not support mutation accumulation as a genetic mechanism for late-life mortality, assuming mutations act recessively. Finally, we test antagonistic pleiotropy by returning replicate populations to a much earlier age of last reproduction for a short evolutionary time, testing for a rapid indirect response of late-life mortality rates. The positive results from this test support antagonistic pleiotropy as a genetic mechanism for the evolution of late-life mortality. Together these experiments comprise the first corroborations of the evolutionary theory of late-life mortality.",2002,"Michael R Rose, Mark D Drapeau, Puya G Yazdi, Kandarp H Shah, Diana B Moise, Rena R Thakar, Casandra L Rauser, Laurence D Mueller, Michael R Rose, Mark D Drapeau, Puya G Yazdi, Kandarp H Shah, Diana B Moise, Rena R Thakar, Casandra L Rauser, Laurence D Mueller"
Genes affecting aging: mapping quantitative trait loci in Drosophila melanogaster using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs),12041827,10.1023/a:1015139514332,"This study examines the use of AFLPs (amplified fragment length polymorphisms) for locating QTL for longevity. Inbred long and short-lived lines from selected stocks of D. melanogaster were backcrossed and measurements of life span compiled into a distribution. AFLP markers assorting with long life were screened from the extremes of that distribution. To test their association with further recombination, a second F1 was backcrossed for three generations and measured. Sires and progeny were genotyped for the markers initially screened. Three AFLP primer pairs identified markers assorting with long life in six of 48 sires. An a posteriori test showed that families of sires with putative markers lived significantly longer on average. A second test showed that within families, progeny with markers lived significantly longer than sibs without them. Marker positions were mapped by hybridization to a P1 genomic miniblot. AFLP markers were cloned, sequenced and matched to known genomic sequences in a BLAST search. Positions were compared to QTL known from other studies. The BLAST search indicated hybridization at multiply dispersed sites throughout the genome. Marker positions also corresponded to many from independent QTL maps. These results indicate that some QTL consist of dispersed duplications that contribute independently to longevity.",2002,"L S Luckinbill, Edward M Golenberg, L S Luckinbill, Edward M Golenberg"
Genetic control of cuticle formation during embryonic development of Drosophila melanogaster,12019232,,"The embryonic cuticle of Drosophila melanogaster is deposited by the epidermal epithelium during stage 16 of development. This tough, waterproof layer is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the larval body. We have characterized mutations in a set of genes required for proper deposition and/or morphogenesis of the cuticle. Zygotic disruption of any one of these genes results in embryonic lethality. Mutant embryos are hyperactive within the eggshell, resulting in a high proportion reversed within the eggshell (the ""retroactive"" phenotype), and all show poor cuticle integrity when embryos are mechanically devitellinized. This last property results in embryonic cuticle preparations that appear grossly inflated compared to wild-type cuticles (the ""blimp"" phenotype). We find that one of these genes, krotzkopf verkehrt (kkv), encodes the Drosophila chitin synthase enzyme and that a closely linked gene, knickkopf (knk), encodes a novel protein that shows genetic interaction with the Drosophila E-cadherin, shotgun. We also demonstrate that two other known mutants, grainy head (grh) and retroactive (rtv), show the blimp phenotype when devitellinized, and we describe a new mutation, called zeppelin (zep), that shows the blimp phenotype but does not produce defects in the head cuticle as the other mutations do.",2002,"Stephen Ostrowski, Herman A Dierick, Amy Bejsovec, Stephen Ostrowski, Herman A Dierick, Amy Bejsovec"
Overexpression of a CREB repressor isoform enhances the female sexual receptivity in Drosophila,12467339,10.1023/a:1020828227074,"The cAMP responsive transcriptional factor, CREB, is highly conserved among animal species, and its activity affects their behavior. In Drosophila melanogaster, one of alternatively spliced products of the CREB gene, dCREB2-a, is a transcriptional activator, while another isoform, dCREB2-b, is a repressor of dCREB2-a. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of dCREB2-b in virgin females enhances their sexual receptivity. We studied the role of dCREB2 in female mating behavior using two transgenic lines, hs-dCREB2-a and hs-dCREB2-b, which overexpress respective products with heat-shock treatment. Wild-type males started their courtship behavior and mated more quickly with heat-shocked hs-dCREB2-b females than with non-heat-shocked hs-dCREB2-b females. Overexpression of dCREB2-a in females affected neither their courtship behavior nor mating frequency. The effects of overexpressed dCREB2-b were not due to elevated locomotor activities of heat-shocked females nor due to more vigorous courtship behavior of paired wild-type males. CREB might be involved in female sexual behavior of animals.",2002,"Takaomi Sakai, Yoshiaki Kidokoro, Takaomi Sakai, Yoshiaki Kidokoro"

The protein sequences of Drosophila KirI (dKirI) and dKirII are moderately (<44%) and dKirIII sequence is weakly (<27%) identical to human Kir channel subunits. During fly development, five dKir channel transcripts derived from three genes are differentially expressed. Whole mount in situ hybridizations revealed dKirI transcripts absent from embryos, but dKirII and dKirIII are expressed in the embryonic hind gut and in Malpighian tubules, respectively, thus covering the entire osmoregulatory system of the developing fly. In the head of adult flies, predominantly dKirII transcripts were detected. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, dKir channel activity was only observed after amino acid substitutions in their cytosolic tails (e.g. exchange of a unique valine in the NH(2) terminus). In contrast, heterologous expression of wild type dKirI and dKirII in Drosophila S2 cells readily evoked typical inwardly rectifying K(+) currents, which were weakly sensitive to Ba(2+).

COP9 signalosome subunits 4 and 5 regulate multiple pleiotropic pathways in Drosophila melanogaster,12223399,,"The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is an essential eight-subunit repressor of light-regulated development in Arabidopsis. This complex has also been identified in animals, though its developmental role remains obscure. CSN subunits have been implicated in various cellular processes, suggesting a possible role for the CSN as an integrator of multiple signaling pathways. In order to elucidate the function of the CSN in animals, a Drosophila model system has previously been established. Gel-filtration analysis with antibodies against CSN subunits 4, 5 and 7 revealed that these proteins act as a complex in Drosophila that is similar in size to the plant and mammalian complexes. Null mutations in either one of two subunits, CSN4 or CSN5, are larval lethal. Successful embryogenesis appears to be a consequence of maternal contribution of the complex. Biochemical analysis indicates that the different subunits are found in both CSN-dependent and CSN-independent forms, and that these forms are differentially affected by the mutations. Phenotypic characterization of these two mutants indicates that they show both shared and unique phenotypes, which suggest specific roles for each subunit.

We report a new gene in the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup, Drosophila nuclear transport factor-2-related (Dntf-2r). Its sequence features and phylogenetic distribution indicate that Dntf-2r is a retroposed functional gene and originated in the common ancestor of D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. mauritiana, within the past 3-12 million years (MY). Dntf-2r evolved more rapidly than the parental gene, under positive Darwinian selection as revealed by the McDonald-Kreitman test and other evolutionary analyses. Comparative expression analysis shows that Dntf-2r is male specific whereas the parental gene, Dntf-2, is widely expressed in D. melanogaster. In agreement with its new expression pattern, the Dntf-2r putative promoter sequence is similar to the late testis promoter of beta2-tubulin.

GAL4 causes developmental defects and apoptosis when expressed in the developing eye of Drosophila melanogaster,12917801,,"The UAS/GAL4 ectopic expression system is widely used in Drosophila melanogaster for the overexpression of transgenes. This system operates under the assumption that the yeast transcription factor, GAL4, is inactive in D. melanogaster. Thus, GAL4 can be expressed under the control of D. melanogaster -specific promoters with little effect upon the organism. We have shown that expression of GAL4 in the developing eye under the control of the glass multiple reporter (GMR) promoter element does have an effect on eye development. Although GMR-GAL4 heterozygotes appear normal when raised at 25 degrees C, the homozygotes have a highly disorganized ommatidial array. In addition, the levels of apoptosis in the third-instar larval eye imaginal disc (where GAL4 is expressed) are slightly higher in GMR-GAL4 heterozygotes, and much higher in GMR-GAL4 homozygotes when compared to wild type discs. The morphological eye defects caused by GMR-GAL4 are significantly enhanced when flies are raised at 29 degrees C (presumably due to the higher activity of GAL4 at this temperature); however, the levels of apoptosis appear to be similar at these two temperatures. Taken together, these data suggest that GAL4 can have adverse effects on D. melanogaster development, especially at high expression levels. In addition, GAL4 appears to induce apoptosis even in the absence of any visible morphological defects. Thus, despite the benefits of the UAS/GAL4 ectopic expression system, one must use caution in the design and interpretation of experiments.",2003,"Jamie M Kramer, Brian E Staveley"
RNomics in Drosophila melanogaster: identification of 66 candidates for novel non-messenger RNAs,12736298,10.1093/nar/gkg361,"By generating a specialised cDNA library from four different developmental stages of Drosophila melanogaster, we have identified 66 candidates for small non-messenger RNAs (snmRNAs) and have confirmed their expression by northern blot analysis. Thirteen of them were expressed at certain stages of D.melanogaster development, only. Thirty-five species belong to the class of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), divided into 15 members from the C/D subclass and 20 members from the H/ACA subclass, which mostly guide 2'-O-methylation and pseudouridylation, respectively, of rRNA and snRNAs. These also include two outstanding C/D snoRNAs, U3 and U14, both functioning as pre-rRNA chaperones. Surprisingly, the sequence of the Drosophila U14 snoRNA reflects a major change of function of this snoRNA in Diptera relative to yeast and vertebrates. Among the 22 snmRNAs lacking known sequence and structure motifs, five were located in intergenic regions, two in introns, five in untranslated regions of mRNAs, eight were derived from open reading frames, and two were transcribed opposite to an intron. Interestingly, detection of two RNA species from this group implies that certain snmRNA species are processed from alternatively spliced pre-mRNAs. Surprisingly, a few snmRNA sequences could not be found on the published D.melanogaster genome, which might suggest that more snmRNA genes (as well as mRNAs) are hidden in unsequenced regions of the genome.",2003,"Guozhong Yuan, Christian KlÃ¤mbt, Jean-Pierre Bachellerie, JÃ¼rgen Brosius, Alexander HÃ¼ttenhofer"

Conditions under which flies in glass tubes placed in the monitor can survive over one month at 25 degrees C were optimized. The active periods of flies were reduced by administration of H(2)O(2) into the media in a dose-dependent manner. Although we used only eight flies per assay, far fewer individuals than in conventional methods, it was possible to detect the effects of H(2)O(2) at a statistically significant level. Increased levels of H(2)O(2) resistance were confirmed in transgenic flies overexpressing antioxidant enzymes, catalase or Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. We applied the method to determine oxidative stress resistance in fly lines bearing insertions of a gene misexpression vector. H(2)O(2) resistance in these flies varied considerably depending on the insertion, and positively correlated with previously determined longevity. We identified one insertion that conferred a significantly higher level of resistance to H(2)O(2) compared to controls. Molecular analysis of the insertion revealed that a misexpressed transcript matched an expressed sequence tag, and suggested that its full-length product was overproduced upon GAL4 activation.

The genetics of mating recognition between Drosophila simulans and D. sechellia,14768896,10.1017/s0016672303006360,"During courtship, visual and chemical signals are often exchanged between the sexes. The proper exchange of such signals ensures intraspecific recognition. We have examined the genetic basis of interspecific differences in male mating behaviour and pheromone concentration between Drosophila simulans and D. sechellia by using Drosophila simulans/D. sechellia introgression lines. Our results show a majority of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) explaining variation in both male mating behaviour and pheromone concentration to be located on the third chromosome. One QTL found on the third chromosome explains variation in time needed to start courtship and copulation as well as time spent courting. The position of such QTL (approximately 84A-88B) with effects on courtship and copulation aspects of mating includes the candidate sex determination gene doublesex (84E5-6) and Voila (86E1-2), a gene that affects male courtship in D. melanogaster. One additional third chromosome QTL explained variation in 7-tricosene pheromone concentrations among males. The interval mapping position of this QTL (approximately 68E-76E) did not overlap with the position detected for differences in mating behaviour and the intervals did not include candidate genes previously identified as having an effect on D. melanogaster cuticular hydrocarbon production.

In addition, nine more members of the Epsilon cluster have been identified through bioinformatic analysis but not further characterized. Of the 11 expressed enzymes, seven accepted the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal as substrate, and nine were active in glutathione conjugation of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Since the enzymically active proteins included the gene products of DmGSTD3 and DmGSTD7 which were previously deemed to be pseudogenes, we investigated them further and determined that both genes are transcribed in Drosophila. Thus our present results indicate that DmGSTD3 and DmGSTD7 are probably functional genes. The existence and multiplicity of insect GSTs capable of conjugating 4-hydroxynonenal, in some cases with catalytic efficiencies approaching those of mammalian GSTs highly specialized for this function, indicates that metabolism of products of lipid peroxidation is a highly conserved biochemical pathway with probable detoxification as well as regulatory functions.",2003,"Rafa?

These post-mating responses are induced mainly by seminal fluid. In Drosophila melanogaster, males transfer two peptides (sex-peptides, = Sps) that reduce receptivity and elicit increased egg laying in their mating partners. Similarities in the open reading frames of the genes suggest that they have arisen by gene duplication. In females, Sps bind to specific sites in the central and peripheral nervous system, and to the genital tract. The binding proteins of the nervous system and genital tract are membrane proteins, but they differ molecularly. The former protein is proposed to be a receptor located at the top of a signalling cascade leading to the two post-mating responses, whereas the latter is a carrier protein moving Sps from the genital tract into the haemolymph. Sps bind to sperm. Together with sperm they are responsible for the persistence of the two post-mating responses.

The sex peptide of Drosophila melanogaster: female post-mating responses analyzed by using RNA interference,12893873,10.1073/pnas.1631635100,"Mating induces profound changes in female insect behavior and physiology. In Drosophila melanogaster, mating causes a reduction in sexual receptivity and an elevation in egg production for at least 5 days. Injection of the seminal fluid sex peptide (SP) induces both responses in virgin females, but only for 1-2 days. The role of SP in eliciting the responses to mating remains to be elucidated. Functional redundancy between seminal fluid components may occur. In addition, mating with spermless males results in brief (1- to 2-day) post-mating responses, indicating either that there is a ""sperm effect"" or that sperm act as carriers for SP or other seminal fluid components. Here we used RNA interference to suppress SP expression, to determine whether SP is required to elicit full post-mating responses, the magnitude of responses due to other seminal fluid components, and whether SP accounts for the ""sperm effect."" Receptivity was higher and egg production lower in females mated to SP knock-down males than in controls. Comparison with virgins showed that the responses were brief. SP is therefore required for normal magnitude and persistence of postmating responses. Sperm transfer and use were normal in mates of SP knock-down males, yet their post-mating responses were briefer than after normal matings, and similar to those reported in mates of spermless son-of-tudor males. The prolonged ""sperm effect"" on female receptivity and egg production is therefore entirely attributable to SP, but sperm are necessary for its occurrence.",2003,"Tracey Chapman, Jenny Bangham, Giovanna Vinti, Beth Seifried, Oliver Lung, Mariana F Wolfner, Hazel K Smith, Linda Partridge, Tracey Chapman, Jenny Bangham, Giovanna Vinti, Beth Seifried, Oliver Lung, Mariana F Wolfner, Hazel K Smith, Linda Partridge"

Four independent Drosophila strains were found with P-element insertions near the dsir2 transcriptional start site as well as extraneous linked recessive lethal mutations. Imprecise excision of one of these P elements (PlacW07223) from a chromosome freed of extraneous lethal mutations produced dsir2(17), a null intragenic deletion allele that generates no DSIR2 protein. Contrary to expectations from the report by Rosenberg and Parkhurst on their P-mobilization allele dSir2(ex10), homozygosity for dsir2(17) had no apparent deleterious effects on viability, developmental rate, or sex ratio, and it fully complemented sir2(ex10). Moreover, through a genetic test, we ruled out the reported effect of dSir2(ex10) on Sex-lethal expression.

Phenotypic plasticity of sternopleural bristle number in temperate and tropical populations of Drosophila melanogaster,12693680,10.1017/s0016672302005967,"We investigated the phenotypic plasticity of sternopleural bristle (SB) number as a function of growth temperature in isofemale lines from temperate (France) and tropical (Congo) populations of Drosophila melanogaster. We found concave reaction norms with a maximum in the middle of the thermal range, except in four African lines which exhibited a regularly decreasing response curve. Genetic variability (intraclass correlation) and evolvability (genetic CV, coefficient of variation) were independent properties and did not change with temperature. Residual, within-line variability was, however, strongly influenced by growth temperature, showing a U-shaped response curve and a minimum CV of 9% at 21.5 degrees C. As expected from a previously known latitudinal cline, maximum values (MV) were higher in temperate than in tropical flies. The temperature of maximum value (TMV) was observed at a higher temperature in the tropical population, in agreement with similar adaptive trends already observed for other quantitative traits. Significant negative correlations within each population were observed between a plasticity curvature parameter and MV or TMV. No difference in curvature was, however, observed between populations, in spite of their very different MVs.",2003,"Brigitte Moreteau, Patricia Gibert, Jean-Marie Delpuech, Georges Petavy, Jean R David, Brigitte Moreteau, Patricia Gibert, Jean-Marie Delpuech, Georges Petavy, Jean R David"
Requirement of the roughest gene for differentiation and time of death of interommatidial cells during pupal stages of Drosophila compound eye development,12782271,10.1016/s0925-4773(03)00040-6,"The roughest locus of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily required for several developmental processes, including axonal pathfinding in the developing optic lobe, mechanosensory bristle differentiation and myogenesis.

We have further investigated its function in the developing pupal retina by performing a developmental and molecular analysis of a novel dominant rst allele, rst(D).

Evaluation of toxic potential of captan: Induction of hsp70 and tissue damage in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster (hsp70-lacZ) Bg9,12717743,10.1002/jbt.10066,"The study investigated the working hypothesis that a widely used fungicide captan exerts toxic effects on nontarget organisms. Transgenic Drosophila melanogaster (hsp70-lacZ) was used as a model by assaying stress gene expression as an endpoint for cytotoxicity and also to evaluate whether stress gene expression is sufficient enough to protect and to prevent tissue damage against toxic insult of the chemical. The study was further extended to understand the effect of the pesticide on development, life cycle, and reproduction of the organism and finally to evaluate a concentration of the chemical to be nontoxic to the organism. The study showed that (i) captan causes cytotoxicity at and above 0.015 ppm; (ii) at 0.0015 ppm captan, absence of hsp70 expression in the exposed organism was evaluated as the concentration referred to as no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for Drosophila; (iii) emergence pattern of flies was affected only at the highest concentration of captan by 4 days, while hatching and survivorship were unaffected even at this concentration; (iv) reproductive performance was significantly affected only at 125.0 and 1250.0 ppm captan, while in the lower dietary concentrations no such deleterious effects were observed; (v) at 1250.0 ppm, hsp70 failed to protect the cells from toxicant assault after 48 h exposure, thus leading to tissue damage as revealed by Trypan Blue staining. The present study shows the cytotoxic potential of captan and further reveals the application of stress genes in determining NOAEL and its expression as bioindicator of exposure to environmental contaminants.",2003,"Aamir Nazir, Indranil Mukhopadhyay, D K Saxena, M Saeed Siddiqui, D Kar Chowdhuri, Aamir Nazir, Indranil Mukhopadhyay, D K Saxena, M Saeed Siddiqui, D Kar Chowdhuri"
Experimental evolution in Drosophila melanogaster: interaction of temperature and food quality selection regimes,14503624,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00590.x,"In Drosophila, both the phenotypic and evolutionary effect of temperature on adult size involves alterations to larval resource processing and affects other life-history traits, that is, development time but most notably, larval survival. Therefore, thermal evolution of adult body size might not be independent of simultaneous adaptation of larval traits to resource availability. Using experimental evolution lines adapted to high and low temperatures at different levels of food, we show that selection pressures interact in shaping larval resource processing. Evolution on poor food invariably leads to lower resource acquisition suggesting a cost to feeding behavior. However, following low temperature selection, lower resource acquisition led to a higher adult body size, probably by more efficient allocation to growth. In contrast, following high temperature selection, low resource acquisition benefited larval survival, possibly by reducing feeding-associated costs. We show that evolved differences to larval resource processing provide a possible proximate mechanism to variation in a suite of correlated life-history traits during adaptation to different climates. The implication for natural populations is that in nature, thermal evolution drives populations to opposite ends of an adult size versus larval survival trade-off by altering resource processing, if resource availability is limited.",2003,"ZoltÃ¡n Bochdanovits, Gerdien de Jong, ZoltÃ¡n Bochdanovits, Gerdien de Jong"

To confirm whether the tim gene exists and works as a clock component in other Drosophila species, we cloned a tim homolog from Drosophila ananassae that shared 85.9% similarity with Drosophila melanogaster tim at the amino acid level. In addition, the PER interaction domains and NLS were highly conserved. Introduction of the D. ananassae tim homolog rescued the rhythm of the locomotor activity of about 44% of a population of D. melanogaster tim(01) flies.

The proportion and genomic distribution of noncanonical copies is distinctive to each family and presents constant features in the four different D. melanogaster strains studied. Most elements of families 297 and mdg 1 were noncanonical and presented large interstock and intrastock polymorphism. Noncanonical elements of these two families were mostly located in euchromatin, although not restricted to it. The elements of families 412 and copia were better conserved.

Several previous studies on Drosophila melanogaster populations from the two disparate slopes of the canyon suggest that these two populations are experiencing incipient speciation. However, recent microsatellite data did not reveal the expected level of population differentiation. Given the importance of this system for studying speciation, we set out to test two predictions of the incipient speciation hypothesis--genetic differentiation and sexual isolation. We sequenced six different Acp genes from isofemale lines from the south-facing slope (11 lines) and north-facing slope (nine lines) of Evolution Canyon. We found no evidence of genetic differentiation between the two slopes (F(ST) = -0.03). We also conducted mate choice tests, using intraslope F1 hybrids between different isofemale lines. There was no significant departure from random mating in mixtures of flies from the two slopes.

Argemone oil induced cellular damage in the reproductive tissues of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster: protective role of 70 kDa heat shock protein,12898646,10.1002/jbt.10082,"We explored the reproductive toxicity of argemone oil and its principal alkaloid fraction in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster (hsp70-lacZ) Bg(9). The toxicity of argemone oil has been attributed to two of its physiologically active benzophenanthridine alkaloids, sanguinarine and dihydrosanguinarine. Freshly eclosed first instar larvae of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster were transferred to different concentrations of argemone oil and its alkaloid fraction contaminated food. Virgin flies that eclosed from the contaminated food were pair-mated to look into the effect on reproduction. The study was further extended by investigating hsp70 expression and tissue damage in larval gonads, genital discs, and reproductive organs of adult fly. Our results showed that argemone oil was more cytotoxic than its principal alkaloid fraction. Moreover, it was the male fly that was more affected compared to its opposite number. The accessory glands of male reproductive system of the fly, which did not express hsp70, exhibited severe damage as evidenced by Trypan blue staining. This prompted us to explore the ultrastructural morphology of the gland, which showed acute signs of necrosis in both the cell types as evident by necrotic nuclei, higher vacuolization, and disorganized endoplasmic reticulum, decrease in the number of Golgi vesicles and disorganized, loosely packed filamentous structures in the lumen of the accessory gland, at the higher concentrations of the adulterant.

We test the role of dietary CoQ in determining Drosophila melanogaster longevity by measuring survival and cytochrome c-oxidase activity (a proxy for aerobic metabolic performance) in flies fed wild-type yeast, CoQ-less yeast, or respiratory control (RC) yeast replete with CoQ but independently deficient in mitochondrial respiration. We find no evidence that dietary manipulation of CoQ in D. melanogaster increases life span or decreases age-dependent decline in cytochrome c oxidase activity.

Fire exit is a potential four transmembrane protein expressed in developing Drosophila glia,12640618,10.1002/gene.10177,"Glia from many diverse organisms play a number of important roles during the development of the nervous system. Therefore, knowing the molecules that control glial cell function will further our understanding of the mechanisms that control nervous system development. We have isolated a novel gene in Drosophila melanogaster that is expressed in a subset of the peripheral glia. We call this gene ""Fire exit"" (Fie), as the glia that express this gene do so during a time when they mark the entry and exit point of axons at the CNS/PNS boundary. This subset of peripheral glia act as intermediate targets during pathfinding and migration of the sensory axons in particular. Fire exit has been cloned and found to encode a novel transmembrane protein. Fire exit belongs to a group of proteins identified in the Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae databases which contain four predicted transmembrane domains and a shared intracellular motif. Mutations that remove the fire exit protein have no obvious disruption to glial function. On the other hand, glia expressing the Fire exit gene bridge the transition zone between CNS and PNS and play a role in sensory axon guidance. Therefore, it appears that, while the glia that express this protein mediate axon guidance, Fire exit itself plays a nonessential part in this function. A role for Fire exit in glial development may be suggested by its evolutionary relationship to a family of lysosome-associated proteins called LAPTMs and suggests that Fire exit may function in intracellular transport during glial development.",2003,"Sheila With, Tiffany Rice, Claudia Salinas, Vanessa Auld, Sheila With, Tiffany Rice, Claudia Salinas, Vanessa Auld"

There was significant variation among substituted lines; lines possessing the third chromosome from the resistant line, which confers resistance to the three organophosphates, generally showed lower mean values of these fitness measures. Chromosomal analyses also indicated significant negative contributions of the third chromosome from the resistant line. However, significant positive contributions of the interactions among chromosomes from the resistant line to these fitness measures were also detected. We further conducted a local stability analysis, in which each chromosome-substituted line was assumed to be introduced at a low frequency into the initial susceptible population. It was demonstrated that the resistance factor(s) on the third chromosome tend to decrease in their frequency under both density-independent and juvenile density-regulated conditions.

An urbilaterian origin of the tripartite brain: developmental genetic insights from Drosophila,12702651,10.1242/dev.00438,"Studies on expression and function of key developmental control genes suggest that the embryonic vertebrate brain has a tripartite ground plan that consists of a forebrain/midbrain, a hindbrain and an intervening midbrain/hindbrain boundary region, which are characterized by the specific expression of the Otx, Hox and Pax2/5/8 genes, respectively. We show that the embryonic brain of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster expresses all three sets of homologous genes in a similar tripartite pattern. Thus, a Pax2/5/8 expression domain is located at the interface of brain-specific otd/Otx2 and unpg/Gbx2 expression domains anterior to Hox expression regions. We identify this territory as the deutocerebral/tritocerebral boundary region in the embryonic Drosophila brain. Mutational inactivation of otd/Otx2 and unpg/Gbx2 result in the loss or misplacement of the brain-specific expression domains of Pax2/5/8 and Hox genes. In addition, otd/Otx2 and unpg/Gbx2 appear to negatively regulate each other at the interface of their brain-specific expression domains. Our studies demonstrate that the deutocerebral/tritocerebral boundary region in the embryonic Drosophila brain displays developmental genetic features similar to those observed for the midbrain/hindbrain boundary region in vertebrate brain development. This suggests that a tripartite organization of the embryonic brain was already established in the last common urbilaterian ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes.",2003,"Frank Hirth, Lars Kammermeier, Erich Frei, Uwe Walldorf, Markus Noll, Heinrich Reichert, Frank Hirth, Lars Kammermeier, Erich Frei, Uwe Walldorf, Markus Noll, Heinrich Reichert"

An association between ADH protein levels and polymorphic nucleotide variation in the Adh gene of Drosophila melanogaster,1584018,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040739,"Southern analysis of the Adh region of 212 Drosophila melanogaster lines collected from the Tahbilk winery revealed linkage disequilibrium between a 37-bp insertion [designated delta 2 by Kreitman (1983)] and the fast electrophoretic variant of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH-F). Among these lines 34% contained the insert and encoded ADH-F, 33.5% encoded ADH-F and did not have the insert, and 32.5% encoded the slow electrophoretic variant of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH-S). Strong linkage association between this insert and ADH-F is evident worldwide. Twenty-nine of the second chromosome lines were characterized for ADH protein quantity by using radial immunodiffusion. ADH quantity was estimated in both larvae and adult males raised in the presence and absence of alcohol supplement to each of two different food media. Analyses of variance indicated higher levels of ADH protein in larvae from lines with the insert (all ADH-F), compared with those without (both ADH-F and ADH-S), independent of either dietary alcohol or media type. No such difference in ADH quantity between insert- and noninsert-containing ADH-F lines was detected in adults, although the expected higher levels occurred in ADH-F lines compared with ADH-S lines. Given the high levels of linkage disequilibrium in the Adh region, these data suggest that either polymorphic nucleotide-site variants positively associated with delta 2 on the second chromosome or delta 2 itself increases larval levels of ADH protein.",1992,"P Matthew, A Agrotis, A C Taylor, S W McKechnie, P Matthew, A Agrotis, A C Taylor, S W McKechnie"
[Influence of mutations in the suppressor of hairy wing and modifier of MDG4 loci on phenotype expression of super-unstable alleles at the yellow locus of Drosophila melanogaster],1446816,,A number of super-unstable systems were obtained earlier by the induction of P-M hybrid dysgenesis in the strains with a mobilized Stalker. One of the super-unstable mutations appeared at the yellow locus of Drosophila melanogaster on the background of preexisting y mutation. The latter had been induced by mdg4 insertion into the regulatory region of the yellow locus. The suppressor genes of Hairy wing and modifier of mdg4 are known to encode proteins which bind to the mdg4 enhancer and are involved in the control of its transcription. A large spectrum of yellow alleles was obtained in super-unstable systems which could be recognized by the intensity of pigmentation in twelve different areas of the cuticle.

Evolution of the expression of the Gld gene in the reproductive tract of Drosophila,1435233,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040777,"During the preadult development of Drosophila melanogaster, the GLD (glucose dehydrogenase) gene (Gld) is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the immature reproductive tract. At the adult stage the expression of Gld becomes largely restricted to the reproductive tract of males and females. We examined the expression of GLD in the adult reproductive tract of 50 species in the genus Drosophila, as well as in those of a few representative species from four other closely related genera. GLD exhibits considerable organ-specific diversity in the reproductive tract of males and females. Among these species, five male GLD phenotypes and six female GLD phenotypes were found. In contrast, the preadult expression of GLD in representative species from each distinct adult pattern type was determined and found to be highly conserved in both the immature reproductive tract and non-reproductive organs. Moreover, the set of reproductive organs that express GLD during preadult development is equivalent to the sum of the five male and six female adult GLD phenotypes. To initially define the contribution of cis- versus trans-acting factors responsible for differences in adult GLD expression between two of these species--D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura--we transferred the D. pseudoobscura Gld to the genome of D. melanogaster and investigated its expression.

We present here the analysis of two mutant strains: the catn1/catn4 heterozygote which exhibits no detectable catalase activity and the catn2 homozygote which exhibits approximately 14% that of the parent reference strain. Since insects lack glutathione peroxidase activity, catalase activity provides the sole enzymatic mechanism for the removal of H2O2. Average and maximum life spans of flies were unaffected by the absence or low levels of catalase activity. The mutants however exhibited adaptive responses in their metabolic rate or glutathione content. The metabolic rate of flies was significantly lowered in the null mutants. Glutathione concentration tended to increase in flies with the hypomorphic catalase allele (exhibiting 14% of the normal catalase activity). Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase activity was significantly higher in the null flies. Activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase were unaffected. Results of this study indicate that 14% of the normal level of catalase activity allows flies to achieve both a normal life span and a normal metabolic potential.

We have used this unique transformant as a tool for studying the expression of the P1 promoter in embryonic, larval and adult development. Parallel lines transformed with the same fusion gene construct did not confer a correct P1 pattern of expression.

There was no notable sex-linked recessive lethal mutation of parent flies and no gene mutation found in their test-cross examination.

The application of Markov chain analysis to oligonucleotide frequency prediction and physical mapping of Drosophila melanogaster,1641330,10.1093/nar/20.14.3651,"Here we compare several methods for predicting oligonucleotide frequencies in 691 kb of Drosophila melanogaster DNA. As in previous work on Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a relatively simple equation based on tetranucleotide frequencies can be used in predicting frequencies of higher order oligonucleotides. For example, the mean of observed/expected abundances of 4,096 hexamers was 1.07 with a sample standard deviation of .55. This simple predictor arises by considering each base on the sense strand of D. melanogaster to depend only on the three bases 5' to it (a 3rd order Markov chain) and is more accurate than the random predictor. This equation is useful in predicting restriction enzyme fragment sizes, selecting restriction enzymes that cut preferentially in coding vs noncoding regions, and in selecting probes to fingerprint clones in contig mapping. Once again, this equation well predicts the occurrence of higher order oligonucleotides, supporting our hypothesis that this predictor holds in evolutionarily diverse organisms. When ranked from highest to lowest abundance, the observed frequencies of oligomers of a given length are closely tracked by the predicted abundances of a 3rd order Markov chain. Through use of the dependence of oligomer frequencies on base composition, we report a list of oligomers that will be useful for the completion of a cosmid physical map of D. melanogaster. Presently, the library is such that it will be possible to construct large contigs using only 30 oligonucleotide probes to fingerprint cosmids.",1992,"A J Cuticchia, R Ivarie, J Arnold, A J Cuticchia, R Ivarie, J Arnold"
A comprehensive study of genic variation in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. V. Structural-functional constraints on protein molecules and enzymes and the levels and patterns of variation among genes,1572525,10.1139/g92-019,"Ever since isozyme-allozyme polymorphisms were detected there has been an incessant effort to relate the amount of observed protein variation to various aspects of molecular structure and function. Structural-functional constraints can limit the amount of overall genic variation, and the observed variation can be due to neutral mutation and random genetic drift, mutation-selection balance, or balancing selection. The present analysis of structural-functional constraints on gene-enzyme variation in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster shows that while both subunit size and substrate group show significant effects on number of alleles and mean heterozygosity, only substrate group affects population structure significantly. Subunit structure (monomer vs. multimer), IUB enzyme class (e.g., transferase, lyase), and tolerance of null alleles showed no significant effect on level or pattern of variation. While partly interdependent, these results suggest that efforts should be made to distinguish between constraints arising from molecular structure and physiological function.",1992,"R S Singh, R S Singh"
Quantitative genetic study on sexual difference in emigration behavior of Drosophila melanogaster in a natural population,1304770,10.1266/jjg.67.463,"A quantitative genetic analysis was conducted on emigration response behavior using 140 second chromosome lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Fourteen sets of 5 x 5 partial diallel cross experiments were made in the parental generation. The emigration activity per batch of 50 male and 50 female F1 progeny was scored with Sakai's population system. Sexual difference did not appear in the emigration activity in these experiments. A significant genotype x sex x set interaction was detected. The genetic variance components of emigration activity differed between sexes: In males, additive genetic variance of emigration activity was 0.0497 +/- 0.0092 and dominance variance, 0.0018 +/- 0.0046; in females, additive, 0.0373 +/- 0.0076 and dominance, 0.0169 +/- 0.0044. Additive genetic correlation between sexes for the emigration activity was 0.685 +/- 0.150, deviating significantly from unity. These results suggested that the genes affecting emigration activity would operate differently between sexes of D. melanogaster in natural populations.",1992,"K Mikasi, K Mikasi"
Maternal effect mutations of the sponge locus affect actin cytoskeletal rearrangements in Drosophila melanogaster embryos,1447298,10.1083/jcb.119.5.1205,"In the syncytial blastoderm stage of Drosophila embryogenesis, dome-shaped actin ""caps"" are observed above the interphase nuclei. During mitosis, this actin rearranges to participate in the formation of pseudocleavage furrows, transient membranous invaginations between dividing nuclei. Embryos laid by homozygous sponge mothers lack these characteristic actin structures, but retain other actin associated structures and processes. Our results indicate that the sponge product is specifically required for the formation of actin caps and metaphase furrows. The specificity of the sponge phenotype permits dissection of both the process of actin cap formation and the functions of actin caps and metaphase furrows. Our data demonstrate that the distribution of actin binding protein 13D2 is unaffected in sponge embryos and suggest that 13D2 is upstream of actin in cortical cap assembly. Although actin caps and metaphase furrows have been implicated in maintaining the fidelity of nuclear division and the positions of nuclei within the cortex, our observations indicate that these structures are dispensible during the early syncytial blastoderm cell cycles. A later requirement for actin metaphase furrows in preventing the nucleation of mitotic spindles between inappropriate centrosomes is observed. Furthermore, the formation of actin caps and metaphase furrows is not a prerequisite for the formation of the hexagonal array of actin instrumental in the conversion of the syncytial embryo into a cellular blastoderm.",1992,"M A Postner, K G Miller, E F Wieschaus, M A Postner, K G Miller, E F Wieschaus"
Role of oxidative stress in Drosophila aging,1383769,10.1016/0921-8734(92)90031-j,"We review the role that oxidative damage plays in regulating the lifespan of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Results from our laboratory show that the lifespan of Drosophila is inversely correlated to its metabolic rate. The consumption of oxygen by adult insects is related to the rate of damage induced by oxygen radicals, which are purported to be generated as by-products of respiration. Moreover, products of activated oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and lipofuscin are higher in animals kept under conditions of increased metabolic rate. In order to understand the in vivo relationship between oxidative damage and the production of the superoxide radical, we generated transgenic strains of Drosophila melanogaster that synthesize excess levels of enzymatically active superoxide dismutase. This was accomplished by P-element transformation of Drosophila melanogaster with the bovine cDNA for CuZn superoxide dismutase, an enzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of the superoxide radical to hydrogen peroxide and water. Adult flies that express the bovine SOD in addition to native Drosophila SOD are more resistant to oxidative stresses and have a slight but significant increase in their mean lifespan. Thus, resistance to oxidative stress and lifespan of Drosophila can be manipulated by molecular genetic intervention. In addition, we have examined the ability of adult flies to respond to various environmental stresses during senescence. Resistance to oxidative stress, such as that induced by heat shock, is drastically reduced in senescent flies. This loss of resistance is correlated with the increase in protein damage generated in old flies by thermal stress and by the insufficient protection from cellular defense systems which includes the heat shock proteins as well as the oxygen radical scavenging enzymes. Collectively, results from our laboratory demonstrate that oxidative damage plays a role in governing the lifespan of Drosophila during normal metabolism and under conditions of environmental stress.",1992,"J E Fleming, I Reveillaud, A Niedzwiecki, J E Fleming, I Reveillaud, A Niedzwiecki"
Variable rates of evolution among Drosophila opsin genes,1398053,,"DNA sequences and chromosomal locations of four Drosophila pseudoobscura opsin genes were compared with those from Drosophila melanogaster, to determine factors that influence the evolution of multigene families. Although the opsin proteins perform the same primary functions, the comparisons reveal a wide range of evolutionary rates. Amino acid identities for the opsins range from 90% for Rh2 to more than 95% for Rh1 and Rh4. Variation in the rate of synonymous site substitution is especially striking: the major opsin, encoded by the Rh1 locus, differs at only 26.1% of synonymous sites between D. pseudoobscura and D. melanogaster, while the other opsin loci differ by as much as 39.2% at synonymous sites. Rh3 and Rh4 have similar levels of synonymous nucleotide substitution but significantly different amounts of amino acid replacement. This decoupling of nucleotide substitution and amino acid replacement suggests that different selective pressures are acting on these similar genes. There is significant heterogeneity in base composition and codon usage bias among the opsin genes in both species, but there are no consistent relationships between these factors and the rate of evolution of the opsins. In addition to exhibiting variation in evolutionary rates, the opsin loci in these species reveal rearrangements of chromosome elements.",1992,"J P Carulli, D L Hartl, J P Carulli, D L Hartl"
Suboptimal 5' and 3' splice sites regulate alternative splicing of Drosophila melanogaster myosin heavy chain transcripts in vitro,1498040,10.1016/0925-4773(92)90075-u,"Using a Drosophila cell-free system, we have analyzed the regulation of alternative splicing of Drosophila muscle myosin heavy chain (MHC) transcripts. Splicing of MHC 3' end transcripts results in exclusion of adult-specific alternative exon 18, as is observed in embryonic and larval muscle in vivo. Mutations that strengthen either the 5' or the 3' splice sites of exon 18 do not promote inclusion of this exon. However, strengthening both splice junctions results in efficient removal of both introns and completely inhibits skip splicing. Our data suggest that the affinity of exons 17 and 19, as well as failure of constitutive splicing factors to recognize exon 18 splice sites, causes the exclusion of exon 18 in wild-type transcripts processed in vitro.",1992,"D Hodges, S I Bernstein, D Hodges, S I Bernstein"
Cell type-specific gene expression in the Drosophila melanogaster male accessory gland,1525037,10.1016/0925-4773(92)90036-j,"The accessory gland of the male Drosophila melanogaster plays a vital role in reproduction. This secretory organ synthesizes products that are transferred to the female and are necessary to elicit the proper physiological and behavioral responses in the female. The accessory gland is composed of two morphologically distinct secretory cell types, the main cells and the secondary cells. Previous studies identified some genes expressed in main cells or in all accessory gland cells. In this paper we use P-element mediated enhancer traps to examine gene expression in the accessory gland. We show that, in addition to genes expressed in main cells only or in all accessory gland secretory cells, there are genes expressed specifically in secondary cells. Each cell type is uniform in the expression of its genes. Our results demonstrate that the two cell types are not only morphologically distinct but also biochemically distinct. We also show that the two cell types differ in their regulation of gene expression in response to mating activity.",1992,"M J Bertram, G A Akerkar, R L Ard, C Gonzalez, M F Wolfner, M J Bertram, G A Akerkar, R L Ard, C Gonzalez, M F Wolfner"
Tissue-specific and dietary control of alpha-amylase gene expression in the adult midgut of Drosophila melanogaster,1374789,10.1002/jez.1402620203,"The regulatory effects of allelic substitution at the trans-acting mapP locus and of dietary glucose on the expression of the duplicate genes for alpha-amylase (Amy) in Drosophila melanogaster were examined in the anterior midgut and posterior midgut regions of mature flies. The levels of amylase activity and amylase protein, as well as the abundance of amylase-specific RNA, were quantified. All 3 parameters of Amy expression were concordant. Results indicate that the effects of both mapP and dietary glucose are exerted at the level of amylase RNA. However, the tissue-specific effects of mapP are restricted to the posterior midgut and can therefore be distinguished from the effects of glucose in food medium, which influences amylase RNA levels in both the anterior and posterior midgut regions. Our data suggest that, in large part, strain-specific effects of dietary glucose can be explained on the basis of alternate alleles at the mapP locus in different homozygous strains of flies. Levels of amylase RNA in tissue extracts of flies from an amylase-null strain were also measured. Low levels were observed in both anterior and posterior midgut extracts. These were unresponsive to dietary conditions.",1992,"D B Thompson, L G Treat-Clemons, W W Doane, D B Thompson, L G Treat-Clemons, W W Doane"
Developmental expression of the Drosophila melanogaster calmodulin gene,1280154,,"The highly conserved, intracellular calcium binding protein calmodulin is present in all cells at all times. In addition to this constitutive level, the amount of calmodulin is highly regulated according to the tissue or stage of development. Since there are only a few genes or a single gene for this protein in most species, intricate regulatory elements may be necessary to effect its complex regulation. This report adds new information concerning the gene structure and outlines the developmental and spatial regulation of Drosophila melanogaster calmodulin transcripts. The gene contains five exons, including a 49 bp exon in the 5' untranslated region, and spans over 16 kb. Homologues to this small, 5' noncoding exon have not been found in other calmodulin genes. The combined level of the transcripts is developmentally regulated, and the relative amounts of the two transcript size classes (1.65 kb and 1.9 kb) are differentially regulated during development. Primer extension experiments and RNase protection mapping show that both size classes of Drosophila calmodulin transcripts initiate at the same site but undergo alternative termination within the final exon. The spatial distribution of calmodulin transcripts was examined by in situ hybridization to sections of adults and to developmentally staged whole mount embryos. Calmodulin transcripts are evenly distributed early in embryogenesis. In later stages of embryogenesis, higher levels accumulate in the developing nerve cord and other tissues. Elevated levels of calmodulin transcripts are seen quite distinctly in the adult neural tissues and in the photoreceptor region of the compound eye.",1992,"O Hanson-Painton, V Randolph, J A Saugstad, S K Oh, S L Tobin, O Hanson-Painton, V Randolph, J A Saugstad, S K Oh, S L Tobin"

The present study describes such investigations. Levels of persistent genetic damage in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster found in the vicinity of the Chernobyl accident site were examined from August 1986 to September 1989. Evidence is presented which indicates a relationship between the levels of radioactive pollution resulting from the Chernobyl accident and increasing genetic damage to exposed populations.

Drosophila melanogaster innate immunity: an emerging role for peptidoglycan recognition proteins in bacteria detection,15004693,10.1007/s00018-003-3243-0,"Over the past years, parallel studies conducted in mammals and flies have emphasized the existence of common mechanisms regulating the vertebrate and invertebrate innate immune systems. This culminated in the discovery of the central role of the Toll pathway in Drosophila immunity and in the implication of Toll-like receptors (TLRs)/interleukin-1(IL-1) in the mammalian innate immune response. In spite of clear similarities, such as shared intracellular pathway components, important divergences are expected between the two groups, whose last common ancestor lived more than half a billion years ago. The most obvious discrepancies lie in the mode of activation of the signalling receptors by microorganisms. In mammals, TLRs are part of protein complexes which directly recognize microbe-associated patterns, whereas Drosophila Toll functions like a classical cytokine receptor rather than a pattern recognition receptor. Recent studies demonstrate that members of the evolutionarily conserved peptidoglycan recognition protein family play an essential role in microbial sensing during immune response of Drosophila.",2004,"J Royet, J Royet"
Organic cation transport by Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster: application of two novel electrophysiological methods,15143149,10.1242/jeb.01003,"Transport of the prototypical organic cation tetraethylammonium (TEA) by the Malpighian tubules, ureters and gut of Drosophila melanogaster was studied using two novel electrophysiological techniques. Both techniques exploited the high selectivity of the cation exchanger potassium tetra-p-chlorophenylborate for tetraalkylammonium compounds relative to inorganic cations such as K(+). In the first technique, TEA fluxes were measured using a non-invasive self-referencing TEA-selective microelectrode positioned in the unstirred layer near the surface of each tissue. TEA fluxes from bath to lumen as large as 6 pmol cm(-2) s(-1) were measured across the lower (reabsorptive) segment of the Malpighian tubule and the ureter bathed in saline containing 0.1 mmol l(-1) TEA. Corresponding bath-to-lumen fluxes across the secretory main segment of the Malpighian tubule and the posterior midgut were approximately 1 pmol cm(-2) s(-1). TEA transport by the lower Malpighian tubule was enhanced by hyperpolarization of the basolateral membrane potential and was inhibited by cimetidine, quinidine, vinblastine and verapamil. In the second technique, TEA concentration was measured using a TEA-selective microelectrode positioned in droplets of fluid secreted by Malpighian tubules set up in saline droplets under oil in a Ramsay assay. Results from the Ramsay assay confirmed the dominant role of the lower Malpighian tubule in net transepithelial secretion of TEA and inhibition of TEA transport by cimetidine.

Functional characterisation of the Anopheles leucokinins and their cognate G-protein coupled receptor,15579553,10.1242/jeb.01317,"Identification of the Anopheles gambiae leucokinin gene from the completed A. gambiae genome revealed that this insect species contains three leucokinin peptides, named Anopheles leucokinin I-III. These peptides are similar to those identified in two other mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Culex salinarius. Additionally, Anopheles leucokinin I displays sequence similarity to Drosophila melanogaster leucokinin. Using a combination of computational and molecular approaches, a full-length cDNA for a candidate leucokinin-like receptor was isolated from A. stephensi, a close relative of A. gambiae. Alignment of the known leucokinin receptors--all G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)--with this receptor, identified some key conserved regions within the receptors, notably transmembrane (TM) domains I, II, III, VI and VII. The Anopheles leucokinins and receptor were shown to be a functional receptor-ligand pair. All three Anopheles leucokinins caused a dose-dependent rise in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) when applied to S2 cells co-expressing the receptor and an aequorin transgene, with a potency order of I>II>III. Drosophila leucokinin was also found to activate the Anopheles receptor with a similar EC50 value to Anopheles leucokinin I. However, when the Anopheles peptides were applied to the Drosophila receptor, only Anopheles leucokinin I and II elicited a rise in [Ca2+]i. This suggests that the Anopheles receptor has a broader specificity for leucokinin ligands than the Drosophila receptor. Antisera raised against the Anopheles receptor identified a doublet of approx. 65 and 72 kDa on western blots, consistent with the presence of four N-glycosylation sites within the receptor sequence, and the known glycosylation of the receptor in Drosophila. In Anopheles tubules, as in Drosophila, the receptor was localised to the stellate cells. Thus we provide the first identification of Anopheles mosquito leucokinins (Anopheles leucokinins) and a cognate leucokinin receptor, characterise their interaction and show that Dipteran leucokinin signalling is closely conserved between Drosophila and Anopheles.",2004,"Jonathan C Radford, Selim Terhzaz, Pablo Cabrero, Shireen-A Davies, Julian A T Dow, Jonathan C Radford, Selim Terhzaz, Pablo Cabrero, Shireen-A Davies, Julian A T Dow"
Overlapping mechanisms function to establish transcriptional quiescence in the embryonic Drosophila germline,14960492,10.1242/dev.01004,"In Drosophila melanogaster, the germline precursor cells, i.e. pole cells, are formed at the posterior of the embryo. As observed for newly formed germ cells in many other eukaryotes, the pole cells are distinguished from the soma by their transcriptional quiescence. To learn more about the mechanisms involved in establishing quiescence, we ectopically expressed a potent transcriptional activator, Bicoid (Bcd), in pole cells. We find that Bcd overrides the machinery that downregulates transcription, and activates not only its target gene hunchback but also the normally female specific Sex-lethal promoter, Sxl-Pe, in the pole cells of both sexes. Unexpectedly, the terminal pathway gene torso-like is required for Bcd-dependent transcription. However, terminal signaling is known to be attenuated in pole cells, and this raises the question of how this is accomplished. We present evidence indicating that polar granule component (pgc) is required to downregulate terminal signaling in early pole cells. Consistently, pole cells compromised for pgc function exhibit elevated levels of activated MAP kinase and premature transcription of the target gene tailless (tll). Furthermore, pgc is required to establish a repressive chromatin architecture in pole cells.",2004,"Girish Deshpande, Gretchen Calhoun, Paul Schedl, Girish Deshpande, Gretchen Calhoun, Paul Schedl"

"Testing the ""rate of living"" model: further evidence that longevity and metabolic rate are not inversely correlated in Drosophila melanogaster",15234957,10.1152/japplphysiol.00505.2004,"In a recent study examining the relationship between longevity and metabolism in a large number of recombinant inbred Drosophila melanogaster lines, we found no indication of the inverse relationship between longevity and metabolic rate that one would expect under the classical ""rate of living"" model. A potential limitation in generalizing from that study is that it was conducted on experimental material derived from a single set of parental strains originally developed over 20 years ago. To determine whether the observations made with those lines are characteristic of the species, we studied metabolic rates and longevities in a second, independently derived set of recombinant inbred lines. We found no correlation in these lines between metabolic rate and longevity, indicating that the ability to both maintain a normal metabolic rate and have extended longevity may apply to D. melanogaster in general. To determine how closely our measurements reflect metabolic rates of flies maintained under conditions of life span assays, we used long-term, flow-through metabolic rate measurements and closed system respirometry to examine the effects of variables such as time of day, feeding state, fly density, mobility of the flies, and nitrogen knockout on D. melanogaster metabolic rate.

Overexpression of the small mitochondrial Hsp22 extends Drosophila life span and increases resistance to oxidative stress,14734639,10.1096/fj.03-0860fje,"Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are involved in protein folding, transport and stress resistance. Studies reporting an increased mRNA level of hsp genes in aged Drosophila suggest that expression of Hsp might be beneficial in preventing damages induced by aging. Because oxidative damage is often observed in aged organisms and mitochondria are sensitive to reactive oxygen species, we tested the hypothesis that increased levels of a small Hsp localized in mitochondria, Hsp22 of Drosophila melanogaster, could protect mitochondrial proteins and influence the aging process. We demonstrate that a ubiquitous or a targeted expression of Hsp22 within motorneurons increases the mean life span by more than 30%. Hsp22 shows beneficial effects on early-aging events since the premortality phase displays the same increase as the mean lifespan. Moreover, flies expressing Hsp22 in their motorneurons maintain their locomotor activity longer as assessed by a negative geotaxis assay. The motorneurons-targeted expression of Hsp22 also significantly increases flies' resistance to oxidative injuries induced by paraquat (up to 35%) and thermal stress (39% at 30 degrees C and 23% at 37 degrees C). These observations establish Hsp22 as a key player in cell-protection mechanisms against oxidative injuries and aging in Drosophila and corroborate the pivotal role of mitochondria in the process of aging.",2004,"GeneviÃ¨ve Morrow, MÃ©lanie Samson, SÃ©bastien Michaud, Robert M Tanguay, GeneviÃ¨ve Morrow, MÃ©lanie Samson, SÃ©bastien Michaud, Robert M Tanguay"

The gene sra encodes a protein similar to human Down syndrome critical region 1 (DSCR1). The ovulation phenotype was reproduced in transgenic virgins expressing UAS-sra in the nervous system. The flies also extruded the ovipositor toward courting males as seen in wild-type mated females, supporting the notion that ovulation and behavioral patterns are physiologically coupled. The sra insertions were found to be hypomorphic alleles with reduced expression levels. Females homozygous for these alleles show: (1) spontaneous ovulation in virgins, (2) sterility with impaired meiotic progression, and (3) compromised postmating responses with lower ovulation level, higher remating rate, and shorter period for restoration of receptivity. No obvious defects were observed in the homozygous males. The gene sra is predominantly expressed in oocytes, nurse cells, and the nervous system.

Three sublines were established from three selected isofemale lines of all four samples (altogether 36 sublines). Alcohol tolerance of the adult flies was assayed in these sublines. The activity of ADH was similar in the two habitats; so was the sensitivity to ethanol. Accordingly, no differences in adaptation to environmental ethanol were detected between the two habitats. The deviations between the two habitats in average activities and in the total variation of enzyme activities were not consistent in the two villages. These results suggest that founder effects and genetic drift are more pronounced in distilleries than selection. The association among enzyme activities varied greatly both between the two villages and between the two habitats.

Decreased expression of Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase 1 in ants with extreme lifespan,14993600,10.1073/pnas.0400222101,"Reactive oxygen species, the by-products of oxidative energy metabolism, are considered a main proximate cause of aging. Accordingly, overexpression of the enzyme Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) can lengthen lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster in the laboratory. However, the role of SOD1 as a main determinant of lifespan has been challenged on the grounds that overexpression might be effective only in compromised genetic backgrounds. Moreover, interspecific comparisons show lower levels of antioxidant activities in longer-lived species, suggesting that life-span extension may evolve through less reactive oxygen species generation from the mitochondria rather than higher expression of SOD1. The tremendous variation in lifespan between ant castes, ranging over 2 orders of magnitude, coupled with the fact that all individuals share the same genome, provides a system to investigate the role of SOD1 in the wild. We used the ant Lasius niger as a model system, because queens can reach the extreme age of 28 years, whereas workers and males live only 1-2 years and a few weeks, respectively. We cloned SOD1 and found that long-lived queens have a lower level of expression than workers and males. Specific enzyme-activity assays also showed higher SOD1 activity levels in males and workers compared with queens, which had SOD1 activity levels similar to that of D. melanogaster. Altogether, these data show that increased expression of SOD1 is not required for the evolution of extreme lifespan, even in a system in which differential gene expression is the only way to express phenotypes with great lifespan differences.",2004,"Joel D Parker, Karen M Parker, Barbara H Sohal, Rajindar S Sohal, Laurent Keller, Joel D Parker, Karen M Parker, Barbara H Sohal, Rajindar S Sohal, Laurent Keller"

Although quantitative genetic data are often consistent with pleiotropy, there are few explicit examples of pleiotropic loci. The Drosophila melanogaster gene Methoprene-tolerant (Met) may be such a locus. The Met gene product, a putative juvenile hormone receptor, facilitates the action of juvenile hormone (JH) and JH analogs; JH affects many life history traits in arthropods. Here we use quantitative complementation to investigate effects of Met mutant and wildtype alleles on female developmental time, onset of reproduction, and fecundity. Whereas the alleles did not differ in their effects on developmental time, we detected allelic variation for the onset of reproduction and for age-specific fecundity. Alleles influenced phenotypic co-variances among traits (developmental time and onset of reproduction; onset of reproduction and both early and late fecundity; early and late fecundity), suggesting that alleles of Met vary in their pleiotropic effects upon life history. Furthermore, the genetic covariance between developmental time and early fecundity attributed to alleles of Met was negative, indicating consistent pleiotropic effects among alleles on these traits. The allelic effects of Met support genetic models where pleiotropy at genes associated with hormone regulation can contribute to the evolution of life history traits.",2004,"Thomas Flatt, Tadeusz J Kawecki, Thomas Flatt, Tadeusz J Kawecki"
Osmotic regulation in adult Drosophila melanogaster during dehydration and rehydration,15159436,10.1242/jeb.01024,"We have examined the osmoregulatory capacities of laboratory populations of the insect Drosophila melanogaster by measuring hemolymph osmotic concentration during desiccation and upon recovery from a bout of desiccation. Recovery treatments entailed allowing the flies access to distilled water, a saline solution or a saline+sucrose solution after a desiccation bout shown to reduce hemolymph volume by approximately 60%. Prior to desiccation, the hemolymph osmotic concentration was 353+/-11 mOsm. We found that Drosophila display strict osmotic regulation under prolonged conditions of dehydration. Osmotic regulation continued during recovery from desiccation, regardless of the fluid provided. This result is evidence that this insect does not require an external source of osmolytes or energy to regulate its hemolymph osmotic concentration or to restore hemolymph volume, which is reduced during desiccation. We also examined populations that have been selected for over 250 generations for enhanced desiccation resistance to identify physiological characters that have evolved in response to the selection regime. The selected lines displayed a reduced pre-desiccation hemolymph osmotic concentration (315+/-7 mOsm) and a marginally improved capacity for osmoregulation.",2004,"Melissa A Albers, Timothy J Bradley, Melissa A Albers, Timothy J Bradley"
Computational identification of microRNA targets,15013811,10.1016/j.ydbio.2003.12.003,"Recent experiments have shown that the genomes of organisms such as worm, fly, human, and mouse encode hundreds of microRNA genes. Many of these microRNAs are thought to regulate the translational expression of other genes by binding to partially complementary sites in messenger RNAs. Phenotypic and expression analysis suggests an important role of microRNAs during development. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to identify microRNA targets. However, no experimental or computational high-throughput method for target site identification in animals has been published yet. Our main result is a new computational method that is designed to identify microRNA target sites. This method recovers with high specificity known microRNA target sites that have previously been defined experimentally. Based on these results, we present a simple model for the mechanism of microRNA target site recognition. Our model incorporates both kinetic and thermodynamic components of target recognition. When we applied our method to a set of 74 Drosophila melanogaster microRNAs, searching 3'UTR sequences of a predefined set of fly mRNAs for target sites which were evolutionary conserved between D. melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura, we found that many key developmental body patterning genes such as hairy and fushi-tarazu are likely to be translationally regulated by microRNAs.",2004,"Nikolaus Rajewsky, Nicholas D Socci, Nikolaus Rajewsky, Nicholas D Socci"
Experimental reduction of codon bias in the Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase gene results in decreased ethanol tolerance of adult flies,15271077,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2004.00725.x,"The ethanol tolerance of adult transgenic flies of Drosophila containing between zero and ten unpreferred synonymous mutations that reduced codon bias in the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene was assayed. As the amino acid sequences of the ADH protein were identical in the four genotypes assayed, differences in ethanol tolerance were due to differences in the abundance of ADH protein, presumably driven by the effects of codon bias on translational efficiency. The ethanol tolerance of genotypes decreased with the number of unpreferred synonymous mutations, and a positive correlation between ADH protein abundance and ethanol tolerance was observed. This work confirms that the fitness effects of unpreferred synonymous mutations that reduce codon bias in a highly expressed gene are experimentally measurable in Drosophila melanogaster.",2004,"David B Carlini, David B Carlini"

The maximum reduction of eye facets was observed in descendants of four-day imago, while in the progeny of older parents, the mutation expressivity was sharply reduced.

Recent studies indicate that DNA methylation in the fruit fly depends on one DNA methyltransferase, dDNMT2. No obvious phenotype is associated with the downregulation of this DNA methyltransferase. Thus, identifying the target sequences methylated by dDNMT2 may constitute the first step towards understanding the biological functions of this enzyme. We used anti-5-methylcytosine antibodies as affinity column to identify the methylated sequences in the genome of adult flies.

Effects of population structure and sex on association between serotonin receptors and Drosophila heart rate,15611167,10.1534/genetics.104.028712,"As a first step toward population and quantitative genetic analysis of neurotransmitter receptors in Drosophila melanogaster, we describe the parameters of nucleotide variation in three serotonin receptors and their association with pupal heart rate. Thirteen kilobases of DNA including the complete coding regions of 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2 were sequenced in 216 highly inbred lines extracted from two North American populations in California and North Carolina. Nucleotide and amino acid polymorphism is in the normal range for Drosophila genes and proteins, and linkage disequilibrium decays rapidly such that haplotype blocks are typically only a few SNPs long. However, intron 1 of 5-HT1A consists of two haplotypes that are at significantly different frequencies in the two populations. Neither this region of the gene nor any of the common amino acid polymorphisms in the three loci associate with either heart rate or heart rate variability. A cluster of SNPs in intron 2 of 5-HT1A, including a triallelic site, do show a highly significant interaction between genotype, sex, and population. While it is likely that a combination of weak, complex selection pressures and population structure has helped shape variation in the serotonin receptors of Drosophila, much larger sampling strategies than are currently adopted in evolutionary genetics will be required to disentangle these effects.",2004,"Naruo Nikoh, April Duty, Greg Gibson, Naruo Nikoh, April Duty, Greg Gibson"
Mutation accumulation and the effect of copia insertions in Drosophila melanogaster,15125062,10.1017/s0016672303006505,"Repeated efforts to estimate the genomic deleterious mutation rate per generation (U) in Drosophila melanogaster have yielded inconsistent estimates ranging from 0.01 to nearly 1. We carried out a mutation-accumulation experiment with a cryopreserved control population in hopes of resolving some of the uncertainties raised by these estimates. Mutation accumulation (MA) was carried out by brother sister mating of 150 sublines derived from two inbred lines. Fitness was measured under conditions chosen to mimic the ancestral laboratory environment of these genotypes. We monitored the insertions of a transposable element, copia, that proved to accumulate at the unusually high rate of 0.24 per genome per generation in one of our MA lines. Mutational variance in fitness increased at a rate consistent with previous studies, yielding a mutational coefficient of variation greater than 3%. The performance of the cryopreserved control relative to the MA lines was inconsistent, so estimates of mutation rate by the Bateman-Mukai method are suspect. Taken at face value, these data suggest a modest decline in fitness of about 0.3% per generation. The element number of copia was a significant predictor of fitness within generations; on average, insertions caused a 0.76% loss in fitness, although the confidence limits on this estimate are wide.",2004,"David Houle, Sergey V Nuzhdin, David Houle, Sergey V Nuzhdin"

Phenotypic deconstruction reveals involvement of manganese transporter malvolio in honey bee division of labor,15326204,10.1242/jeb.01151,"Molecular analysis of a complex behavioral phenotype is facilitated by dissecting it into simpler behavioral components. Using this approach, we present evidence implicating increased manganese transport by the malvolio (mvl) gene into brain cells as one factor that influences age-related division of labor in honey bee colonies. We studied mvl because manganese affects sucrose responsiveness in Drosophila melanogaster, and sucrose responsiveness is related to division of labor in honey bee colonies. Honey bee foragers are more responsive to sucrose in the laboratory than are younger nurse bees, and pollen foragers are more responsive to sucrose than nectar foragers. Levels of mvl mRNA in the brain and manganese in the head were higher in pollen foragers compared with nurses, with nectar foragers intermediate. Manganese treatment increased honey bee sucrose responsiveness and caused precocious foraging. Manganese levels showed a similar pattern to mvl mRNA but manganese treatment did not increase pollen foraging. These results suggest that, while there are molecular pathways common to sucrose responsiveness and division of labor, linkages between a complex behavior and some of its simpler behavioral components are not obligatory. Together with previous findings, these results support the idea that some feeding-related genes in Drosophila have been used in social evolution to regulate division of labor.",2004,"Yehuda Ben-Shahar, Nichole L Dudek, Gene E Robinson, Yehuda Ben-Shahar, Nichole L Dudek, Gene E Robinson"

Several different genotypes of reproducing and non-reproducing males from F(1) crosses among isogenic lines were studied. Our results suggest that significant mortality levelling can occur even in non-reproducing males, but that reproduction also significantly affects mortality patterns. The results show that mortality levelling is strongly affected by the Gompertz initial mortality rate and exponential rate of increase parameters, probably through the effects of heterogeneity in mortality risks.",2004,"Takahiro Miyo, Brian Charlesworth, Takahiro Miyo, Brian Charlesworth"

Activity of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) affects sucrose responsiveness and habituation in Drosophila melanogaster,15169860,10.1101/lm.71604,"The cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) has many cellular functions in vertebrates and insects that affect complex behaviors such as locomotion and foraging. The foraging (for) gene encodes a PKG in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we demonstrate a function for the for gene in sensory responsiveness and nonassociative learning. Larvae of the natural variant sitter (for(s)) show less locomotor activity during feeding and have a lower PKG activity than rover (for(R)) larvae. We used rover and sitter adult flies to test whether PKG activity affects (1) responsiveness to sucrose stimuli applied to the front tarsi, and (2) habituation of proboscis extension after repeated sucrose stimulation. To determine whether the differences observed resulted from variation in the for gene, we also tested for(s2), a sitter mutant produced on a rover genetic background. We found that rovers (for(R)) were more responsive to sucrose than sitters (for(s) and for(s2)) at 1-, 2-, and 3-wk old. This was true for both sexes. Differences in sucrose responsiveness between rovers and sitters were greater after 2 h of food deprivation than after 24 h. Of flies with similar sucrose responsiveness, for(R) rovers showed less habituation and generalization of habituation than for(s) and for(s2) sitters.

Unusual functional properties of homo- and heteromultimeric histamine-gated chloride channels of Drosophila melanogaster: spontaneous currents and dual gating by GABA and histamine,15531107,10.1016/j.neulet.2004.09.031,"Histamine acts as a neurotransmitter of photoreceptors in insects and other arthropods, where it directly activates a chloride channel and mediates rapid inhibitory responses. Homo- and heteromultimeric histamine-gated ion channels formed by HisCl-alpha2 or HisCl-alpha1 + alpha2 subunits from Drosophila melanogaster were characterized by two-electrode voltage-clamp measurements of functionally expressed ion channels in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The sensitivity of heteromultimeric histamine receptors with an EC(50) of 2.3 microM is lower than that of either homomultimeric receptor. They can be further distinguished from the homomultimeric channels by their reduced sensitivity to d-tubocurarine. Heteromultimeric channels generate a spontaneous current in the absence of any agonist. This spontaneous current can be blocked in the absence of an agonist by d-tubocurarine and the histamine antagonists cimetidine, thioperamide and pyrilamine. Homomultimeric HisCl-alpha2 channels are dually gated by histamine (IC(50)=9.4 microM) and GABA (IC(50)=1.0mM), both of which are full agonists. The action of both agonists can be blocked with comparable IC(50) values by the histamine antagonists cimetidine, thioperamide and pyrilamine but not by the GABA antagonist bicuculline. Picrotoxin blocked with an IC(50) of 403 microM.

Although the XPG-N- and XPG-I-domains are highly conserved in sequence, locations of the domains are similar to those of FEN-1 and EXO-1, and the molecular weight of the protein is close to that of EXO-1. In vitro, DmGEN showed endonuclease and 3'-5' exonuclease activities with both single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), but the endonuclease action with dsDNA was quite specific: 5'-3' exonuclease activity was found to occur with nicked DNA, while dsDNA was endonucleolytically cut at 3-4 bp from the 5' end.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain these differences, based on the evolutionary history of the two species, and claim differences either in the effective size of the population or in genome characteristics. Recent data suggest, however, that the higher amount of TEs in D. melanogaster could be associated with the worldwide invasion of D. melanogaster a long time ago while D. simulans is still under the process of such geographical spread. Stresses due to new environmental conditions and crosses between migrating populations could explain the mobilization of TEs while the flies colonize.

Copper homoeostasis in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells,15239669,10.1042/BJ20040745,"Copper homoeostasis was investigated in the Drosophila melanogaster S2 cell line to develop an insect model for the study of copper regulation. Real-time PCR studies have demonstrated expression in S2 cells of putative orthologues of human Cu regulatory genes involved in the uptake, transport, sequestration and efflux of Cu. Drosophila orthologues of the mammalian Cu chaperones, ATOX1 (a human orthologue of yeast ATX1), CCS (copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase), COX17 (a human orthologue of yeast COX17), and SCO1 and SCO2, did not significantly respond transcriptionally to increased Cu levels, whereas MtnA, MtnB and MtnD (Drosophila orthologues of human metallothioneins) were up-regulated by Cu in a time- and dose-dependent manner. To examine the effect on Cu homoeostasis, expression of several key copper homoeostasis genes was suppressed using double-stranded RNA interference. Suppression of the MTF-1 (metal-regulatory transcription factor 1), reduced both basal and Cu-induced gene expressions of MtnA, MtnB and MtnD, significantly reducing the tolerance of these cells to increased Cu. Suppression of either Ctr1A (a Drosophila orthologue of yeast CTR1) or Ctr1B significantly reduced Cu uptake from media, demonstrating that both these proteins function to transport Cu into S2 cells. Significantly, Cu induced Ctr1B gene expression, and this could be prevented by suppressing MTF-1, suggesting that Ctr1B might be involved in Cu detoxification. Suppression of DmATP7, the putative homologue of human Cu transporter genes ATP7A and ATP7B, significantly increased Cu accumulation, demonstrating that DmATP7 is essential for efflux of excess Cu.

Interactions of ultraspiracle with ecdysone receptor in the transduction of ecdysone- and juvenile hormone-signaling,15794746,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2005.04578.x,"Analyses of integration of two-hormone signaling through the vertebrate nuclear hormone receptors, for which the retinoid X receptor is one partner, have generated a number of mechanistic models, including those described as 'subordination' models wherein ligand-activation of one partner is subordinate to the liganded state of the other partner. However, mechanisms by which two-hormone signaling is integrated through invertebrate nuclear hormone-binding receptors has not been heretofore experimentally elucidated. This report investigates the integration of signaling of invertebrate juvenile hormone (JH) and 20-OH ecdysone (20OHE) at the level of identified nuclear receptors (ultraspiracle and ecdysone receptor), which transcriptionally activate a defined model core promoter (JH esterase gene), through specified hormone response elements (DR1 and IR1). Application of JH III, or 20OHE, to cultured Sf9 cells transfected with a DR1JHECoreLuciferase (or IR1JHECoreLuciferase) reporter promoter each induced expression of the reporter. Cotreatment of transfected cells with both hormones yielded a greater than additive effect on transcription, for especially the IR1JHECoreLuciferase reporter. Overexpression in Sf9 cells of recombinant Drosophila melanogaster ultraspiracle (dUSP) fostered formation of dUSP oligomer (potentially homodimer), as measured by coimmunoprecipitation assay and electrophoretic mobility assay (EMSA) on a DR1 probe, and also increased the level of transcription in response to JH III, but did not increase the transcriptional response to either 20OHE treatment alone or to the two hormones together. Inapposite, overexpression of recombinant D. melanogaster ecdysone receptor (dEcR) in the transfected cells generated dUSP/dEcR heterodimer [as measured by EMSA (supershift) on a DR1 probe] and increased the transcriptional response to 20OHE-alone treatment, but did not increase the transcriptional response to the JH III-alone treatment. Our studies provide evidence that in this model system, JH III-activation of the reporter promoter is through USP oligomer (homodimer) that does not contain EcR, while the 20OHE-activation is through the USP/EcR heterodimer. These results also show that the integration of JH III and 20OHE signaling is through the USP/EcR heterodimer, but that when the EcR partner is unliganded, the USP partner in this system is unable to transduce the JH III-activation.",2005,"Fang Fang, Yong Xu, Davy Jones, Grace Jones, Fang Fang, Yong Xu, Davy Jones, Grace Jones"

The mushroom bodies of dachshund mutants exhibit a marked reduction in the size of the vertical lobes and disorganization of the horizontal lobes. In mosaic animals, mutant axons fail to contribute significantly to the mushroom body alpha lobe. Here we show that this defect is due to the misrouting of alphabeta axons to the region normally occupied by alpha'beta' axons. This defect is pronounced for clones generated in larval stages but not clones generated after pupariation, indicating that dachshund function is particularly important around the time of puparium formation. In addition, mushroom body axons exhibit excessive branching in dachshund mutant clones. Thus, dachshund is required in mushroom body neurons for proper axon guidance and branching.",2005,"Sharyl R Martini, Ronald L Davis, Sharyl R Martini, Ronald L Davis"

Human Hop and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog Sti1p, which share a common domain arrangement, are functionally interchangeable in a yeast growth assay and in supporting the efficient maturation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function. To gain a better understanding of Hop structure/function relationships, we have extended comparisons to the Hop ortholog from Drosophila melanogaster (dHop), which lacks DP1. Although dHop binds Hsp70 and Hsp90 and can rescue the growth defect in yeast lacking Sti1p, dHop failed to support GR function in yeast, which suggests a novel role for Hop in GR maturation that goes beyond Hsp binding.

Profiling early infection responses: Pseudomonas aeruginosa eludes host defenses by suppressing antimicrobial peptide gene expression,15695583,10.1073/pnas.0409588102,"Insights into the host factors and mechanisms mediating the primary host responses after pathogen presentation remain limited, due in part to the complexity and genetic intractability of host systems. Here, we employ the model Drosophila melanogaster to dissect and identify early host responses that function in the initiation and progression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenesis. First, we use immune potentiation and genetic studies to demonstrate that flies mount a heightened defense against the highly virulent P. aeruginosa strain PA14 when first inoculated with strain CF5, which is avirulent in flies; this effect is mediated via the Imd and Toll signaling pathways. Second, we use whole-genome expression profiling to assess and compare the Drosophila early defense responses triggered by the PA14 vs. CF5 strains to identify genes whose expression patterns are different in susceptible vs. resistant host-pathogen interactions, respectively. Our results identify pathogenesis- and defense-specific genes and uncover a previously undescribed mechanism used by P. aeruginosa in the initial stages of its host interaction: suppression of Drosophila defense responses by limiting antimicrobial peptide gene expression. These results provide insights into the genetic factors that mediate or restrict pathogenesis during the early stages of the bacterial-host interaction to advance our understanding of P. aeruginosa-human infections.",2005,"Yiorgos Apidianakis, Michael N Mindrinos, Wenzhong Xiao, Gee W Lau, Regina L Baldini, Ronald W Davis, Laurence G Rahme, Yiorgos Apidianakis, Michael N Mindrinos, Wenzhong Xiao, Gee W Lau, Regina L Baldini, Ronald W Davis, Laurence G Rahme"
Basigin (EMMPRIN/CD147) interacts with integrin to affect cellular architecture,15928045,10.1242/jcs.02408,"Basigin, an IgG family glycoprotein found on the surface of human metastatic tumors, stimulates fibroblasts to secrete matrix metalloproteases that remodel the extracellular matrix. Using Drosophila melanogaster we identify intracellular, matrix metalloprotease-independent, roles for basigin. Specifically, we found that basigin, interacting with integrin, is required for normal cell architecture in some cell types. Basigin promotes cytoskeletal rearrangements and the formation of lamellipodia in cultured insect cells. Loss of basigin from photoreceptors leads to misplaced nuclei, rough ER and mitochondria, as well as to swollen axon terminals. These changes in intracellular structure suggest cytoskeletal disruptions. These defects can be rescued by either fly or mouse basigin. Basigin and integrin colocalize to cultured cells and to the visual system. Basigin-mediated changes in the architecture of cultured cells require integrin binding activity. Basigin and integrin interact genetically to affect cell structure in the animal, possibly by forming complexes at cell contacts that help organize internal cell structure.",2005,"Kathryn D Curtin, Ian A Meinertzhagen, Robert J Wyman, Kathryn D Curtin, Ian A Meinertzhagen, Robert J Wyman"
Genotoxicity testing of Plantago major extracts in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,15612001,10.1002/em.20079,"Plantago major is used in many parts of the world for the treatment of diseases and to promote the healing of wounds. In the present study, the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster was used to evaluate the genotoxic activity of an aqueous extract of P. major. The following Drosophila crosses were made: standard (ST) cross, in which virgin flare females (flr3/TM3, Bds) were mated with mwh/mwh males, and high-bioactivation (HB) cross, in which virgin ORR females (ORR/ORR; flr3/TM3, Bds) were mated with mwh/mwh males. Each cross produced two types of descendents, marker-transheterozygous (MH) (mwh +/+ flr3) and balancer-heterozygous (BH) (mwh +/+ TM3, Bds) flies. Three-day-old larvae of both types of descendents were treated with undiluted and diluted (1:1 and 1:2 in water) aqueous extracts of P. major. The extracts were genotoxic in both crosses, producing similar induced frequencies in ST and HB flies. Comparison of the frequencies of wing spots in the BH and MH descendents indicated that recombination was a major response. The results indicate that, under these experimental conditions, aqueous extracts of P. major are genotoxic (recombinagenic).",2005,"VÃ¢nia Maria Sartini Dutra Pimenta, JÃºlio CÃ©sar Nepomuceno, VÃ¢nia Maria Sartini Dutra Pimenta, JÃºlio CÃ©sar Nepomuceno"
Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells: a model system to study Chlamydia interaction with host cells,15839901,10.1111/j.1462-5822.2005.00508.x,"Chlamydia spp. are major causes of important human diseases, but dissecting the host-pathogen interactions has been hampered by the lack of bacterial genetics and the difficulty in carrying out forward genetic screens in mammalian hosts. RNA interference (RNAi)-based methodologies for gene inactivation can now be easily carried out in genetically tractable model hosts, such as Drosophila melanogaster, and offer a new approach to identifying host genes required for pathogenesis. We tested whether Chlamydia trachomatis infection of D. melanogaster S2 cells recapitulated critical aspects of mammalian cell infections. As in mammalian cells, C. trachomatis entry was greatly reduced by heparin and cytochalasin D. Inclusions were formed in S2 cells, acquired Golgi-derived sphingolipids, and avoided phagolysosomal fusion. Elementary body (EB) to reticulate body (RB) differentiation was observed, however, no RB to EB development or host cell killing was observed. RNAi-mediated inactivation of Rac, a Rho GTPase recently shown to be required for C. trachomatis entry in mammalian cells, inhibits C. trachomatis infection in S2 cells. We conclude that Drosophila S2 cells faithfully mimic early events in Chlamydia host cell interactions and provides a bona fide system to systematically dissect host functions important in the pathogenesis of obligate intracellular pathogens.",2005,"C Elwell, J N Engel, C Elwell, J N Engel"

It was shown that Adement as neuroprotector causes the delay of neurodegenerative changes by 10-15 days and increase of lifetime by 14%. None of the studied low-molecular fractions did not reveal the better effect on these indices than the total preparation. The use of Adement as neuroactivating agent in the complex with other preparations (neuroprotective agent + neuroactivating agent + neuroretardant) is more effective as the development of neurodegenerative changes in mutant brain stops for 20-27 days depending on genotype and a mean lifetime increases by 10-33%.",2005,"V Radysh, I Stupnyts'ka, M Kucherenko, O Plakhta, O Makarenko, E Hasul', D Maksymiv, Ia Chernyk, V Radysh, I Stupnyts'ka, M Kucherenko, O Plakhta, O Makarenko, E Hasul', D Maksymiv, Ia Chernyk"

Female-specific hyperacetylation of histone H4 in the chicken Z chromosome,15861309,10.1007/s10577-005-1505-4,"Birds undergo genetic sex determination using a ZW sex chromosome system. Although the avian mechanisms of neither sex determination nor dosage compensation are understood, a female-specific non-coding RNA (MHM) is expressed soon after fertilisation from the single Z chicken chromosome and is likely to have a role in one or both processes. We have now discovered a prominent female-specific modification to the Z chromatin in the region of the MHM locus. We find that chicken chromatin at Zp21, including the MHM locus, is strongly enriched for acetylation of histone H4 at lysine residue 16 in female but not male chromosomes. Interestingly, this specific histone modification is also enriched along the length of the up-regulated Drosophila melanogaster male X chromosome where it plays a vital role in the dosage compensation process.",2005,"Laura Bisoni, Laura Batlle-Morera, Adrian P Bird, Miho Suzuki, Heather A McQueen, Laura Bisoni, Laura Batlle-Morera, Adrian P Bird, Miho Suzuki, Heather A McQueen"

Here, we have subjected Drosophila melanogaster to 29 generations of replicated divergent artificial selection for mating speed. The phenotypic response to selection was highly asymmetrical in the direction of reduced mating speed, with estimates of realized heritability averaging 7%. The selection response was largely attributable to a reduction in female receptivity. We assessed the whole genome transcriptional response to selection for mating speed using Affymetrix GeneChips and a rigorous statistical analysis. Remarkably, >3,700 probe sets (21% of the array elements) exhibited a divergence in message levels between the Fast and Slow replicate lines. Genes with altered transcriptional abundance in response to selection fell into many different biological process and molecular function Gene Ontology categories, indicating substantial pleiotropy for this complex behavior.

Naturally occurring transposable elements disrupt hsp70 promoter function in Drosophila melanogaster,15574805,10.1093/molbev/msi063,"Naturally occurring transposable element (TE) insertions that disrupt Drosophila promoters are correlated with modified promoter function and are posited to play a significant role in regulatory evolution, but their phenotypes have not been established directly. To establish the functional consequences of these TE insertions, we created constructs with either TE-bearing or TE-lacking hsp70 promoters fused to a luciferase reporter gene and assayed luciferase luminescence in transiently transfected Drosophila cells. Each of the four TEs reduces luciferase signal after heat shock and heat inducibility of the hsp70 promoter. To test if the differences in hsp70 promoter activity are TE-sequence dependent, we replaced each of the TEs with multiple intergenic sequences of equal length. These replacement insertions similarly reduced luciferase signal, suggesting that the TEs affect hsp70 promoter function by altering promoter architecture. These results are consistent with differences in Hsp70 expression levels, inducible thermotolerance, and fecundity previously associated with the TEs. That two different varieties of TEs in two different hsp70 genes have common effects suggests that TE insertion represents a general mechanism through which selection manipulates hsp70 gene expression.",2005,"Daniel N Lerman, Martin E Feder, Daniel N Lerman, Martin E Feder"
The insulin-PI3K/TOR pathway induces a HIF-dependent transcriptional response in Drosophila by promoting nuclear localization of HIF-alpha/Sima,16278294,10.1242/jcs.02648,"The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of a constitutively expressed HIF-beta subunit and an oxygen-regulated HIF-alpha subunit. We have previously defined a hypoxia-inducible transcriptional response in Drosophila melanogaster that is homologous to the mammalian HIF-dependent response. In Drosophila, the bHLH-PAS proteins Similar (Sima) and Tango (Tgo) are the functional homologues of the mammalian HIF-alpha and HIF-beta subunits, respectively. HIF-alpha/Sima is regulated by oxygen at several different levels that include protein stability and subcellular localization. We show here for the first time that insulin can activate HIF-dependent transcription, both in Drosophila S2 cells and in living Drosophila embryos. Using a pharmacological approach as well as RNA interference, we determined that the effect of insulin on HIF-dependent transcriptional induction is mediated by PI3K-AKT and TOR pathways. We demonstrate that stimulation of the transcriptional response involves upregulation of Sima protein but not sima mRNA. Finally, we have analyzed in vivo the effect of the activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway on the subcellular localization of Sima protein. Overexpression of dAKT and dPDK1 in normoxic embryos provoked a major increase in Sima nuclear localization, mimicking the effect of a hypoxic treatment. A similar increase in Sima nuclear localization was observed in dPTEN homozygous mutant embryos, confirming that activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway promotes nuclear accumulation of Sima protein. We conclude that regulation of HIF-alpha/Sima by the PI3K-AKT-TOR pathway is a major conserved mode of regulation of the HIF-dependent transcriptional response in Drosophila.",2005,"AndrÃ©s Dekanty, SofÃ­a Lavista-Llanos, Maximiliano Irisarri, Sean Oldham, Pablo Wappner, AndrÃ©s Dekanty, SofÃ­a Lavista-Llanos, Maximiliano Irisarri, Sean Oldham, Pablo Wappner"

The interactions inter se of this set of genes were then assayed in the presence and in the absence of the original Syntaxin1A mutation to ask whether the relationships among the 16 genes remain stable or differ after a change in genetic context.

Molecular genetic analysis of the nested Drosophila melanogaster lamin C gene,15965247,10.1534/genetics.105.043208,"Lamins are intermediate filaments that line the inner surface of the nuclear envelope, providing structural support and making contacts with chromatin.

LamC is nested within an intron of the essential gene ttv. We demonstrate that null mutations in LamC are lethal, and expression of a wild-type LamC transgene rescues lethality of LamC but not ttv mutants. Mutations in the human A-type lamin gene lead to diseases called laminopathies. To determine if Drosophila might serve as a useful model to study lamin biology and disease mechanisms, we generated transgenic flies expressing mutant LamC proteins modeled after human disease-causing lamins. These transgenic animals display a nuclear lamin aggregation phenotype remarkably similar to that observed when human mutant A-type lamins are expressed in mammalian cells. LamC aggregates also cause disorganization of lamin Dm0, indicating interdependence of both lamin types for proper lamina assembly.

"Behavioral, physical, and demographic changes in Drosophila populations through dietary restriction",16300483,10.1111/j.1474-9726.2005.00181.x,"Dietary restriction (DR) is a valuable experimental tool for studying the aging process. Primary advancement of research in this area has relied on rodent models, but attention has recently turned toward Drosophila melanogaster. However, little is known about the baseline effects of DR on wild-type Drosophila and continued experimentation requires such information. The findings described here survey the effects of DR on inbred, wild-type populations of Canton-S fruit flies and demonstrate a robust effect of diet on longevity. Over a circumscribed range of dietary conditions, healthy lifespan varies by as much as 121% for wild-type Drosophila females. Significant differences are also observed for male flies, but the magnitude of the DR effect is less robust. Mortality analyses of the survivorship data reveal that this variation in lifespan can be attributed to a modulation of the rate parameter for the mortality function - a change in the demographic rate of aging. Since the feeding of fruit flies is less easily controlled than that of rodents, this research also addresses the validity of applying a DR model to Drosophila populations. Feeding and body weight data for flies given the various dietary conditions surveyed indicate that Drosophila on higher-calorie diets consume a similar volume of food to those on a low-calorie diet, resulting in different levels of calorie intake. Fertility and activity levels demonstrate that the diets surveyed are comparable, and that increasing the calorie content of laboratory food up to twice the normal concentration is not pathologic for experimental fly populations.",2005,"Tyson G Bross, Blanka Rogina, Stephen L Helfand, Tyson G Bross, Blanka Rogina, Stephen L Helfand"

Fucosyltransferase substrate specificity and the order of fucosylation in invertebrates,15604090,10.1093/glycob/cwi028,"Core alpha1,6-fucosylation is a conserved feature of animal N-linked oligosaccharides being present in both invertebrates and vertebrates. To prove that the enzymatic basis for this modification is also evolutionarily conserved, cDNAs encoding the catalytic regions of the predicted Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster homologs of vertebrate alpha1,6-fucosyltransferases (E.C. 2.4.1.68) were engineered for expression in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Recombinant forms of both enzymes were found to display core fucosyltransferase activity as shown by a variety of methods. Unsubstituted nonreducing terminal GlcNAc residues appeared to be an obligatory feature of the substrate for the recombinant Caenorhabditis and Drosophila alpha1,6-fucosyltransferases, as well as for native Caenorhabditis and Schistosoma mansoni core alpha1,6-fucosyltransferases. On the other hand, these alpha1,6-fucosyltransferases could not act on N-glycopeptides already carrying core alpha1,3-fucose residues, whereas recombinant Drosophila and native Schistosoma core alpha1,3-fucosyltransferases were able to use core alpha1,6-fucosylated glycans as substrates. Lewis-type fucosylation was observed with native Schistosoma extracts and could take place after core alpha1,3-fucosylation, whereas prior Lewis-type fucosylation precluded the action of the Schistosoma core alpha1,3-fucosyltransferase. Overall, we conclude that the strict order of fucosylation events, previously determined for fucosyltransferases in crude extracts from insect cell lines (core alpha1,6 before core alpha1,3), also applies for recombinant Drosophila core alpha1,3- and alpha1,6-fucosyltransferases as well as for core fucosyltransferases in schistosomal egg extracts.",2005,"Katharina Paschinger, Erika Staudacher, Ute Stemmer, GustÃ¡v Fabini, Iain B H Wilson, Katharina Paschinger, Erika Staudacher, Ute Stemmer, GustÃ¡v Fabini, Iain B H Wilson"

Here we report that the classical Drosophila melanogaster locus tan encodes a novel enzyme required for two very different cellular functions: hydrolysis of N-beta-alanyl dopamine (NBAD) to dopamine during cuticular melanization, and hydrolysis of carcinine to histamine in the metabolism of photoreceptor neurotransmitter. We characterized two tan-like P-element insertions that failed to complement classical tan mutations. Both are inserted in the 5' untranslated region of the previously uncharacterized gene CG12120, a putative homolog of fungal isopenicillin-N N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.164). Both P insertions showed abnormally low transcription of the CG12120 mRNA. Ectopic CG12120 expression rescued tan mutant pigmentation phenotypes and caused the production of striking black melanin patterns. Electroretinogram and head histamine assays indicated that CG12120 is required for hydrolysis of carcinine to histamine, which is required for histaminergic neurotransmission. Recombinant CG12120 protein efficiently hydrolyzed both NBAD to dopamine and carcinine to histamine. We conclude that D. melanogaster CG12120 corresponds to tan.

Multilocus patterns of nucleotide variability and the demographic and selection history of Drosophila melanogaster populations,15930491,10.1101/gr.3541005,"Uncertainty about the demographic history of populations can hamper genome-wide scans for selection based on population genetic models. To obtain a portrait of the effects of demographic history on genome variability patterns in Drosophila melanogaster populations, we surveyed noncoding DNA polymorphism at 10 X-linked loci in large samples from three African and two non-African populations. All five populations show significant departures from expectations under the standard neutral model. We detect weak but significant differentiation between East (Kenya and Zimbabwe) and West/Central sub-Saharan (Gabon) African populations. A skew toward high-frequency-derived polymorphisms, elevated levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and significant heterogeneity in levels of polymorphism and divergence in the Gabon sample suggest that this population is further from mutation-drift equilibrium than the two Eastern African populations. Both non-African populations harbor significantly higher levels of LD, a large excess of high-frequency-derived mutations and extreme heterogeneity among loci in levels of polymorphism and divergence. Rejections of the neutral model in D. melanogaster populations using these and similar features have been interpreted as evidence for an important role for natural selection in shaping genome variability patterns. Based on simulations, we conclude that simple bottleneck models are sufficient to account for most, if not all, polymorphism features of both African and non-African populations. In contrast, we show that a steady-state recurrent hitchhiking model fails to account for several aspects of the data.

A mutation with major effects on Drosophila melanogaster sex pheromones,15489528,10.1534/genetics.104.033159,"Sex pheromones are intraspecific chemical signals that are crucial for mate attraction and discrimination. In Drosophila melanogaster, the predominant hydrocarbons on the cuticle of mature female and male flies are radically different and tend to stimulate or inhibit male courtship, respectively. This sexual difference depends largely upon the number of double bonds (one in males and two in females) added by desaturase enzymes. A mutation was caused by a PGal4 transposon inserted in the desat1 gene that codes for the desaturase crucial for setting these double bonds. Homozygous mutant flies produced 70-90% fewer sex pheromones than control flies, and the pheromonal difference between the sexes was almost abolished. A total of 134 excision alleles were induced by pulling out all or a part of the transposon. The pheromonal profile was generally rescued in excision alleles with a completely or largely removed transposon whereas it remained mutant in alleles with a larger piece of the transposon. Five desat1 transcripts were detected during larval-to-adult development. Their levels were precisely quantified in 24-hr-old adults, a critical period for the production of sex pheromones. Three transcripts significantly varied between control females and males; however, the predominant transcript showed no difference. In mutant flies, the predominant transcript was highly decreased with the two sexually dimorphic transcripts.

In Drosophila melanogaster, three genes, paired, gooseberry and gooseberry-neuro, regulate segmental patterning of the epidermis and nervous system. Paired acts as a pair-rule gene and gooseberry as a segment polarity gene. Studies of Pax group III genes in other insects have indicated that their expression is a good marker for understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of segmentation. We have cloned three Pax group III genes from the honeybee (Apis mellifera) and examined their relationships to other insect Pax group III genes and their expression patterns during honeybee segmentation. The expression pattern of the honeybee homologue of paired is similar to that of paired in Drosophila, but its expression is modulated by anterior-posterior temporal patterning similar to the expression of Pax group III proteins in Tribolium. The expression of the other two Pax group III genes in the honeybee indicates that they also act in segmentation and nervous system development, as do these genes in other insects.",2005,"Peter W Osborne, Peter K Dearden, Peter W Osborne, Peter K Dearden"
Paucity of chimeric gene-transposable element transcripts in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,16283942,10.1186/1741-7007-3-24,"Background:
      
    

    
      Recent analysis of the human and mouse genomes has shown that a substantial proportion of protein coding genes and cis-regulatory elements contain transposable element (TE) sequences, implicating TE domestication as a mechanism for the origin of genetic novelty. To understand the general role of TE domestication in eukaryotic genome evolution, it is important to assess the acquisition of functional TE sequences by host genomes in a variety of different species, and to understand in greater depth the population dynamics of these mutational events.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Using an in silico screen for host genes that contain TE sequences, we identified a set of 63 mature ""chimeric"" transcripts supported by expressed sequence tag (EST) evidence in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. We found a paucity of chimeric TEs relative to expectations derived from non-chimeric TEs, indicating that the majority (approximately 80%) of TEs that generate chimeric transcripts are deleterious and are not observed in the genome sequence. Using a pooled-PCR strategy to assay the presence of gene-TE chimeras in wild strains, we found that over half of the observed chimeric TE insertions are restricted to the sequenced strain, and approximately 15% are found at high frequencies in North American D. melanogaster populations. Estimated population frequencies of chimeric TEs did not differ significantly from non-chimeric TEs, suggesting that the distribution of fitness effects for the observed subset of chimeric TEs is indistinguishable from the general set of TEs in the genome sequence.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      In contrast to mammalian genomes, we found that fewer than 1% of Drosophila genes produce mRNAs that include bona fide TE sequences. This observation can be explained by the results of our population genomic analysis, which indicates that most potential chimeric TEs in D. melanogaster are deleterious but that a small proportion may contribute to the evolution of novel gene sequences such as nested or intercalated gene structures. Our results highlight the need to establish the fixity of putative cases of TE domestication identified using genome sequences in order to demonstrate their functional importance, and reveal that the contribution of TE domestication to genome evolution may vary drastically among animal taxa.",2005,"Mikhail Lipatov, Kapa Lenkov, Dmitri A Petrov, Casey M Bergman, Mikhail Lipatov, Kapa Lenkov, Dmitri A Petrov, Casey M Bergman"
Reverse transcriptional profiling: non-correspondence of transcript level variation and proximal promoter polymorphism,16107220,10.1186/1471-2164-6-110,"Background:
      
    

    
      Variation in gene expression between two Drosophila melanogaster strains, as revealed by transcriptional profiling, seldom corresponded to variation in proximal promoter sequence for 34 genes analyzed. Two sets of protein-coding genes were selected from pre-existing microarray data: (1) those whose expression varied significantly and reproducibly between strains, and (2) those whose transcript levels did not vary. Only genes whose regulation of expression was uncharacterized were chosen. At least one kB of the proximal promoters of 15-19 genes in each set was sequenced and compared between strains (Oregon R and Russian 2b).
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Of the many promoter polymorphisms, 89.6% were SNPs and 10.4% were indels, including homopolymer tracts, microsatellite repeats, and putative transposable element footprints. More than half of the SNPs were changes within a nucleotide class. Hypothetically, genes differing in expression between the two strains should have more proximal promoter polymorphisms than those whose expression is similar. The number, frequency, and type of polymorphism, however, were the same in both sets of genes. In fact, the promoters of six genes with significantly different mRNA expression were identical in sequence.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:

A single mutation alters production and discrimination of Drosophila sex pheromones,15705556,10.1098/rspb.2004.2971,"The evolution of communication is a fundamental biological problem. The genetic control of the signal and its reception must be tightly coadapted, especially in inter-individual sexual communication. However, there is very little experimental evidence for tight genetic linkage connecting the emission of a signal and its reception. We found that a single genomic transposon inserted in the desatl gene of Drosophila melanogaster simultaneously affected the emission and the perception of sex-specific signals. This mutation greatly decreased the production of unsaturated hydrocarbons on the cuticle of mature flies of both sexes. These substances represent the sex pheromones necessary for mate discrimination: control males could not discriminate the sex of mutant desatl flies. Moreover, mutant males were unable to discriminate the sex pheromones of con-trol flies. Expression of desatl was found in the peripheral tissues that produce and detect sex pheromones. Excision of the transposon rescued both the production and discrimination phenotypes, but the two effects did not always coincide. This indicates that the emission and perception of pheromones are coded by differ-ent products of the same gene, reflecting the pleiotropic activity of desatl .",2005,"Fabrice Marcillac, YaÃ«l Grosjean, Jean-FranÃ§ois Ferveur, Fabrice Marcillac, YaÃ«l Grosjean, Jean-FranÃ§ois Ferveur"
Pattern profiling and mapping of the fat body transcriptome in Drosophila melanogaster,16339120,10.1038/oby.2005.233,"In Drosophila, the fat body is a collective name for the masses and sheets of adipose tissue that are distributed throughout the fly body.

The objective of this study was to map the transcriptome of the fat body in flies and thus provide genomics and bioinformatics tools for developing a Drosophila model for addressing the genetic complexity of obesity in humans. The gene-EST Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) matches revealed that these ESTs could represent 12,188 coding genes in the Drosophila genome. Among them, at least 2,261 are expressed in the fat body, including 41 identified as preferentially expressed genes with logarithm of odds >3.0. Self-organizing map analysis revealed a cluster of 290 genes favorably expressed in the fat body compared with genes expressed in five other tissues.

Structure and microtubule-nucleation activity of isolated Drosophila embryo centrosomes characterized by whole mount scanning and transmission electron microscopy,16091939,10.1007/s00418-005-0032-x,"Experimental approaches in Drosophila melanogaster over the last 20 years have played a fundamental role in elucidating the function, structure and molecular composition of the centrosome. However, quantitative data on the structure and function of the Drosophila centrosome are still lacking. This study uses, for the first time, whole mount electron microscopy in combination with negative staining on isolated centrosomes from the early Drosophila embryos to analyze its dimensions, structure and capacity to nucleate microtubules in vitro. We show that these organelles are on average 0.75 microm in diameter and have abundant pericentriolar material which often appears fibrillar and with bulbous protrusions. Corresponding to the abundant pericentriolar material, extensive microtubule nucleation occurs. Quantification of the number of microtubules nucleated showed that 50-300 active nucleation sites are present. We examined via electron microscopy immunogold labeling the distribution of gamma-tubulin, CNN, Asp and the MPM-2 epitopes that are phosphorylated through Polo and the Cdk1 kinase. The distribution of these proteins is homogeneous, with the MPM-2 epitopes exhibiting the highest density. In contrast, centrosomal subdomains are identified using a centriole marker to relate centrosome size to the centriole number by electron microscopy. In conclusion, we present a clear-cut technique assaying and quantifying the microtubule nucleation capacity and antigen distribution complementing molecular studies on centrosome protein complexes, cell organelle assembly and protein composition.",2005,"B M H Lange, G Kirfel, I Gestmann, V Herzog, C GonzÃ¡lez, B M H Lange, G Kirfel, I Gestmann, V Herzog, C GonzÃ¡lez"

Testing whether male age or high nutrition causes the cessation of reproductive aging in female Drosophila melanogaster populations,15929716,10.1089/rej.2005.8.86,"Fecundity seems to stop declining and plateaus at low levels very late in Drosophila melanogaster populations. Here we test whether this apparent cessation of reproductive aging by a population, herein referred to as fecundity plateaus, is robust under various environmental influences: namely, male age and nutrition. The effect of male age on late age fecundity patterns was tested by supplying older females with young males before average population fecundity declined to plateau levels. The second possible environmental influence we tested was nutrition and whether late-life fecundity plateaus arise from a decline in the calories available for reproduction. This hypothesis was tested by comparing average daily female fecundity with both low- and high-lifetime nutrition. Both hypotheses were tested by measuring mid- and late-life fecundity for each cohort under the various environmental influences, and statistically testing whether fecundity stops declining and plateaus at late ages. These experiments demonstrate that mid- and late-life population fecundity patterns are significantly affected by the age of males and nutrition level. However, male age and nutrition level did not affect the existence of late-life fecundity plateaus, which demonstrates the robustness of our earlier findings.

We generated multiple fusions between DE-cadherin and alpha-catenin as well as point-mutated beta-catenin and analyzed their ability to support these types of adhesion. We found that (1) although linking DE-cadherin to alpha-catenin is essential, regulation of the link is not required in any of these types of adhesion; (2) beta-catenin is required only to link DE-cadherin to alpha-catenin; and (3) the cytoplasmic domain of DE-cadherin has an additional specific function for the invasive migration of border cells, which is conserved to other cadherins.

The Y chromosome as a target for acquired and amplified genetic material in evolution,16299764,10.1002/bies.20321,"The special properties of the Y chromosome stem form the fact that it is a non-recombining degenerate derivative of the X chromosome. The absence of homologous recombination between the X and the Y chromosome leads to gradual degeneration of various Y chromosome genes on an evolutionary timescale. The absence of recombination, however, also favors the accumulation of transposable elements on the Y chromosome during its evolution, as seen with both Drosophila and mammalian Y chromosomes. Alongside these processes, the acquisition and amplification of autosomal male benefit genes occur. This review will focus on recent studies that reveal the autosome-acquired genes on the Y chromosome of both Drosophila and humans. The evolution of the acquired and amplified genes on the Y chromosome is also discussed. Molecular and comparative analyses of Y-linked repeats in the Drosophila melanogaster genome demonstrate that there was a period of their degeneration followed by a period of their integration into RNAi silencing, which was beneficial for male fertility.

Hypoxia induces major effects on cell cycle kinetics and protein expression in Drosophila melanogaster embryos,15498965,10.1152/ajpregu.00520.2004,"Hypoxia induces a stereotypic response in Drosophila melanogaster embryos: depending on the time of hypoxia, embryos arrest cell cycle activity either at metaphase or just before S phase. To understand the mechanisms underlying hypoxia-induced arrest, two kinds of experiments were conducted. First, embryos carrying a kinesin-green fluorescent protein construct, which permits in vivo confocal microscopic visualization of the cell cycle, showed a dose-response relation between O2 level and cell cycle length. For example, mild hypoxia (Po2 approximately 55 Torr) had no apparent effect on cell cycle length, whereas severe hypoxia (Po2 approximately 25-35 Torr) or anoxia (Po2 = 0 Torr) arrested the cell cycle. Second, we utilized Drosophila embryos carrying a heat shock promoter driving the string (cdc25) gene (HS-STG3), which permits synchronization of embryos before the start of mitosis. Under conditions of anoxia, we induced a stabilization or an increase in the expression of several G1/S (e.g., dE2F1, RBF2) and G2/M (e.g., cyclin A, cyclin B, dWee1) proteins. This study suggests that, in fruit fly embryos, 1) there is a dose-dependent relationship between cell cycle length and O2 levels in fruit fly embryos, and 2) stabilized cyclin A and E2F1 are likely to be the mediators of hypoxia-induced arrest at metaphase and pre-S phase.",2005,"R M Douglas, R Farahani, P Morcillo, A Kanaan, T Xu, G G Haddad, R M Douglas, R Farahani, P Morcillo, A Kanaan, T Xu, G G Haddad"

We present here the crystal structure of recombinant D. melanogaster hemoglobin at 1.20 A resolution. Spectroscopic data show that the protein displays a hexacoordinated heme, whose axial ligands are the proximal and distal His residues. Such bis-His ligation of the heme has sizable effects on the protein local structure.

Dorsal closure is a morphogenetic process similar to wound healing, whereby a gap in the epithelium is closed through the coordinated action of different cell types. Surprisingly, this complex process requires microtubule function exclusively in epithelial cells and only for the last step, the zippering, which seals the gap. Preceding zippering, the epithelial microtubules reorganize to attain an unusual spatial distribution, which we describe with subcellular resolution in the intact, living organism.

Virulence traits that are involved in mammalian infection are important for the interaction of fungi with these hosts. Screening of fungal virulence traits using mutagenized fungi to determine changes in fungal infectivity of non-mammalian hosts has been used to identify novel virulence proteins used to infect C. elegans such as Kin1 (a serine/threonine protein kinase) and Rom2 (a Rho1 guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor) from Cryptococcus neoformans.

Parasitic arthropod Wolbachia are characterized by the presence of phages that carry ankyrin-repeat proteins; these proteins might be exported to the host cell to manipulate reproduction. In nematode Wolbachia, which lack these phages, several biochemical pathways can deliver essential metabolites to the nematode hosts.

Changes in genetic architecture during relaxation in Drosophila melanogaster selected on divergent virgin life span,16405593,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2005.00972.x,"Artificial selection experiments often confer important information on the genetic correlations constraining the evolution of life history.

The decrease in progeny production in long-lived lines, a strong indication of antagonistic pleiotropy, had disappeared during relaxation. This was associated with a higher cost of reproduction to long-lived flies in mated, but not in virgin life span. These data strongly suggest that genetic mechanisms of mated and virgin life span determination are partly independent. Furthermore, data on body weight, developmental time and viability indicated deleterious effects of longevity selection in either direction, giving rise to a nonlinear relationship with life span for these characters.

We find a signature of positive selection in the ds2 promoter, but not in the control gene, sas. This signature appears to be confined to the derived M population. We also find that the selection has been recent because the gene retains a signature of a selective sweep evidenced by the departure of Fay and Wu's H test from neutral expectation. We also find that ds2, as well as its duplicate pair ds1, has been maintained in the Drosophila genus for at least 40 Myr without any sign of adaptive change.

Evidence of an in vivo functional link between the related coactivator dAda2a and dGcn5, however, is lacking. Here we present data on the genetic interaction of dGcn5 and dAda2a.

Multitrait evolution in lines of Drosophila melanogaster selected for increased starvation resistance: the role of metabolic rate and implications for the evolution of longevity,16929660,,"Starvation resistance is a trait often associated with longevity. Animals with increased longevity frequently show elevated starvation resistance and vice versa. Consequently, both life-history traits are thought to share genetic and physiological mechanisms, such as increased fat content and lowered metabolic rate. Here, we present results from 20 generations of selection on Drosophila melanogaster for increased starvation resistance at the time of adult eclosion. We observe that starvation resistance can be the result of more than one mechanism, all associated with an increase in fat resources. In general, metabolic rate is lowered under starved conditions relative to fed conditions. Metabolic rate in the starvation resistant lines is generally higher than in control lines under starved conditions. Starvation resistant flies are able to sustain a higher metabolic rate for a longer period of time when food is unavailable. This implies depletion of the increased fat reserves. However, longevity was not consistently affected by selection for increased starvation resistance.

Conservation patterns in different functional sequence categories of divergent Drosophila species,16697139,10.1016/j.ygeno.2006.03.012,"We have explored the distributions of fully conserved ungapped blocks in genome-wide pair-wise alignments of recently completed species of Drosophila: D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D. virilis, and D. mojavensis. Based on these distributions we have found that nearly every functional sequence category possesses its own distinctive conservation pattern, sometimes independent of the overall sequence conservation level. In the coding and regulatory regions, the ungapped blocks were longer than in introns, UTRs, and nonfunctional sequences. At the same time, the blocks in the coding regions carried a 3N + 2 signature characteristic of synonymous substitutions in the third-codon position. Larger block sizes in transcription regulatory regions can be explained by the presence of conserved arrays of binding sites for transcription factors. We also have shown that the longest ungapped blocks, or ""ultraconserved"" sequences, are associated with specific gene groups, including those encoding ion channels and components of the cytoskeleton. We discuss how restraining conservation patterns may help in mapping functional sequence categories and improve genome annotation.",2006,"Dmitri Papatsenko, Andrey Kislyuk, Michael Levine, Inna Dubchak, Dmitri Papatsenko, Andrey Kislyuk, Michael Levine, Inna Dubchak"
"The Drosophila ortholog of the endolysosomal membrane protein, endolyn, regulates cell proliferation",16924678,10.1002/jcb.20965,"Endolyn (CD164) is a sialomucin that regulates the proliferation, adhesion, and migration of human haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. This molecule is predominately localized in endocytotic compartments, where it may contribute to endolysosomal biogenesis and trafficking. In order to more closely define the function of endolyn from an evolutionary view-point, we first analyzed endolyn orthologs in species ranging from insects, fish, and birds to mammals. The predicted molecular structures of the endolyn orthologs from these species are well conserved, particularly with respect to significant O-linked glycosylation of the extracellular domain, and the high degree of amino acid similarities within their transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, with the latter possessing the lysosomal target signal, YXXphi. Focusing on Drosophila, our studies showed that the subcellular distribution of endolyn in non-polarized Drosophila S2 cells resembles that of its human counterpart in hematopoietic cells, with its predominant localization being within intracellular vesicles, while a small fraction occurs on the cell surface. Both Y --> A and L --> A mutations in the YHTL motif perturbed the normal subcellular distribution of Drosophila endolyn. Interestingly, embryonic and early larval development was often arrested in endolyn-deficient Drosophila mutants. This may partly be due to the role of endolyn in regulating cell proliferation, since knock-down of endolyn expression in S2 cells resulted in up to 50% inhibition of cell growth, with a proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that endolyn is an evolutionarily conserved sialomucin fundamentally involved in cell proliferation in both the human and Drosophila melanogaster.",2006,"Guang-Qian Zhou, Youyi Zhang, David J P Ferguson, Sa Chen, Asa Rasmuson-Lestander, Frederick C Campbell, Suzanne M Watt, Guang-Qian Zhou, Youyi Zhang, David J P Ferguson, Sa Chen, Asa Rasmuson-Lestander, Frederick C Campbell, Suzanne M Watt"
Activity-dependent synaptic capture of transiting peptidergic vesicles,16767091,10.1038/nn1719,"Synapses require resources synthesized in the neuronal soma, but there are no known mechanisms to overcome delays associated with the synthesis and axonal transport of new proteins generated in response to activity, or to direct resources specifically to active synapses. Here, in vivo imaging of the Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction reveals a cell-biological strategy that addresses these constraints. Peptidergic vesicles continually transit through resting terminals, but retrograde peptidergic vesicle flux is accessed following activity to rapidly boost neuropeptide content in synaptic boutons. The presence of excess transiting vesicles implies that synaptic neuropeptide stores are limited by the capture of peptidergic vesicles at the terminal, rather than by synthesis in the soma or delivery via the axon. Furthermore, activity-dependent capture from a pool of transiting vesicles provides a nerve terminal-based mechanism for directing distally and slowly generated resources quickly to active synapses. Finally, retrograde transport in the nerve terminal is regulated by activity.",2006,"Dinara Shakiryanova, Arvonn Tully, Edwin S Levitan, Dinara Shakiryanova, Arvonn Tully, Edwin S Levitan"
Increase of the spontaneous mutation rate in a long-term experiment with Drosophila melanogaster,16547099,10.1534/genetics.106.056200,"In a previous experiment, the effect of 255 generations of mutation accumulation (MA) on the second chromosome viability of Drosophila melanogaster was studied using 200 full-sib MA1 lines and a large C1 control, both derived from a genetically homogeneous base population. At generation 265, one of those MA1 lines was expanded to start 150 new full-sib MA2 lines and a new C2 large control. After 46 generations, the rate of decline in mean viability in MA2 was approximately 2.5 times that estimated in MA1, while the average degree of dominance of mutations was small and nonsignificant by generation 40 and moderate by generation 80. In parallel, the inbreeding depression rate for viability and the amount of additive variance for two bristle traits in C2 were 2-3 times larger than those in C1. The results are consistent with a mutation rate in the line from which MA2 and C2 were derived about 2.5 times larger than that in MA1. The mean viability of C2 remained roughly similar to that of C1, but the rate of MA2 line extinction increased progressively, leading to mutational collapse, which can be ascribed to accelerated mutation and/or synergy after important deleterious accumulation.",2006,"Victoria Avila, David ChavarrÃ­as, Enrique SÃ¡nchez, Antonio Manrique, Carlos LÃ³pez-Fanjul, Aurora GarcÃ­a-Dorado, Victoria Avila, David ChavarrÃ­as, Enrique SÃ¡nchez, Antonio Manrique, Carlos LÃ³pez-Fanjul, Aurora GarcÃ­a-Dorado"
Does the desaturase-2 locus in Drosophila melanogaster cause adaptation and sexual isolation?,16610320,,"The desaturase-2 (desat2) locus of Drosophila melanogaster has two alleles whose frequencies vary geographically: one (the ""Z"" allele) is found primarily in east Africa and the Caribbean, and the other (the ""M"" allele) occurs in other parts of the world. It has been suggested that these alleles not only cause sexual isolation between races, but that their distribution reflects differential adaptation to climate: Z alleles are supposedly adapted to tropical conditions and M alleles to temperate ones. This has thus been viewed as a case of reproductive isolation evolving as a pleiotropic byproduct of adaptation. Here we reinvestigate this presumed climatic adaptation, using transgenic lines differing in the nature of their desat2 alleles. We were unable to replicate earlier results showing that carriers of M alleles are uniformly more cold resistant and less starvation resistant than carriers of Z alleles. It is thus doubtful whether the distribution of these alleles reflects natural selection involving climate. Mating studies of transgenic lines show some evidence for sexual isolation due to desat2. However, work on other, wild-type lines, as well as observations on the nature of sexual isolation, suggest that this conclusion--and thus the relationship between this locus and mating discrimination between races of D. melanogaster--may also be doubtful.",2006,"Jerry A Coyne, Susannah Elwyn, Jerry A Coyne, Susannah Elwyn"

A generalization of the van-der-Pol oscillator underlies active signal amplification in Drosophila hearing,16612585,10.1007/s00249-006-0059-5,"The antennal hearing organs of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster boost their sensitivity by an active mechanical process that, analogous to the cochlear amplifier of vertebrates, resides in the motility of mechanosensory cells. This process nonlinearly improves the sensitivity of hearing and occasionally gives rise to self-sustained oscillations in the absence of sound. Time series analysis of self-sustained oscillations now unveils that the underlying dynamical system is well described by a generalization of the van-der-Pol oscillator. From the dynamic equations, the underlying amplification dynamics can explicitly be derived. According to the model, oscillations emerge from a combination of negative damping, which reflects active amplification, and a nonlinear restoring force that dictates the amplitude of the oscillations. Hence, active amplification in fly hearing seems to rely on the negative damping mechanism initially proposed for the cochlear amplifier of vertebrates.",2006,"R Stoop, A Kern, M C GÃ¶pfert, D A Smirnov, T V Dikanev, B P Bezrucko, R Stoop, A Kern, M C GÃ¶pfert, D A Smirnov, T V Dikanev, B P Bezrucko"
Dynamic genetic interactions determine odor-guided behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,17028343,10.1534/genetics.106.060574,"Understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits requires identification of the underlying genes and characterization of gene-by-gene and genotype-by-environment interactions. Behaviors that mediate interactions between organisms and their environment are complex traits expected to be especially sensitive to environmental conditions. Previous studies on the olfactory avoidance response of Drosophila melanogaster showed that the genetic architecture of this model behavior depends on epistatic networks of pleiotropic genes. We performed a screen of 1339 co-isogenic p[GT1]-element insertion lines to identify novel genes that contribute to odor-guided behavior and identified 55 candidate genes with known p[GT1]-element insertion sites. Characterization of the expression profiles of 10 p[GT1]-element insertion lines showed that the effects of the transposon insertions are often dependent on developmental stage and that hypomorphic mutations in developmental genes can elicit profound adult behavioral deficits. We assessed epistasis among these genes by constructing all possible double heterozygotes and measuring avoidance responses under two stimulus conditions. We observed enhancer and suppressor effects among subsets of these P-element-tagged genes, and surprisingly, epistatic interactions shifted with changes in the concentration of the olfactory stimulus. Our results show that the manifestation of epistatic networks dynamically changes with alterations in the environment.",2006,"Deepa Sambandan, Akihiko Yamamoto, Juan-JosÃ© Fanara, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt, Deepa Sambandan, Akihiko Yamamoto, Juan-JosÃ© Fanara, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt"
Quantitative trait loci for thermotolerance phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster,16404413,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800786,"For insects, temperature is a major environmental variable that can influence an individual's behavioral activities and fitness. Drosophila melanogaster is a cosmopolitan species that has had great success in adapting to and colonizing diverse thermal niches. This adaptation and colonization has resulted in complex patterns of genetic variation in thermotolerance phenotypes in nature. Although extensive work has been conducted documenting patterns of genetic variation, substantially less is known about the genomic regions or genes that underlie this ecologically and evolutionarily important genetic variation. To begin to understand and identify the genes controlling thermotolerance phenotypes, we have used a mapping population of recombinant inbred (RI) lines to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect variation in both heat- and cold-stress resistance. The mapping population was derived from a cross between two lines of D. melanogaster (Oregon-R and 2b) that were not selected for thermotolerance phenotypes, but exhibit significant genetic divergence for both phenotypes. Using a design in which each RI line was backcrossed to both parental lines, we mapped seven QTL affecting thermotolerance on the second and third chromosomes. Three of the QTL influence cold-stress resistance and four affect heat-stress resistance. Most of the QTL were trait or sex specific, suggesting that overlapping but generally unique genetic architectures underlie resistance to low- and high-temperature extremes. Each QTL explained between 5 and 14% of the genetic variance among lines, and degrees of dominance ranged from completely additive to partial dominance. Potential thermotolerance candidate loci contained within our QTL regions are identified and discussed.",2006,"T J Morgan, T F C Mackay, T J Morgan, T F C Mackay"
The Drosophila melanogaster Cajal body,16533947,10.1083/jcb.200511038,"Cajal bodies (CBs) are nuclear organelles that are usually identified by the marker protein p80-coilin.

U85 small CB-specific RNA, U2 small nuclear RNA, the survival of motor neurons protein, and fibrillarin occur together in a nuclear body that is closely associated with the nucleolus. Based on its similarity to CBs in other organisms, we refer to this structure as the D. melanogaster CB. Surprisingly, the D. melanogaster U7 small nuclear RNP resides in a separate nuclear body, which we call the histone locus body (HLB). The HLB is invariably colocalized with the histone gene locus. Thus, canonical CB components are distributed into at least two nuclear bodies in D. melanogaster.

To identify the biochemical reaction catalyzed by tafazzin, we expressed the full-length isoform of Drosophila melanogaster tafazzin in a baculovirus-Sf9 insect cell system. Tafazzin expression induced a new enzymatic function in Sf9 cell mitochondria, namely 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-phosphatidylcholine:monolysocardiolipin linoleoyltransferase. We also found evidence for the reverse reaction, because tafazzin expression caused transfer of acyl groups from phospholipids to 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-lyso-phosphatidylcholine. An affinity-purified tafazzin construct, tagged with the maltose-binding protein, catalyzed both forward and reverse transacylations between cardiolipin and phosphatidylcholine, but was unable to utilize CoA or acyl-CoA as substrates. Whereas tafazzin supported transacylations between various phospholipid-lysophospholipid pairs, it showed the highest rate for the phosphatidylcholine-cardiolipin transacylation. Transacylation activities were about 10-fold higher for linoleoyl groups than for oleoyl groups, and they were negligible for arachidonoyl groups. The data show that Drosophila tafazzin is a CoA-independent, acyl-specific phospholipid transacylase with substrate preference for cardiolipin and phosphatidylcholine.",2006,"Yang Xu, Ashim Malhotra, Mindong Ren, Michael Schlame, Yang Xu, Ashim Malhotra, Mindong Ren, Michael Schlame"

Similarities and differences of polyadenylation signals in human and fly,16836751,10.1186/1471-2164-7-176,"Background:
      
    

    
      Cleavage of messenger RNA (mRNA) precursors is an essential step in mRNA maturation. The signal recognized by the cleavage enzyme complex has been characterized as an A rich region upstream of the cleavage site containing a motif with consensus AAUAAA, followed by a U or UG rich region downstream of the cleavage site.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We studied these signals using exhaustive databases of cleavage sites obtained from aligning raw expressed sequence tags (EST) sequences to genomic sequences in Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster. These data show that the polyadenylation signal is highly conserved in human and fly. In addition, de novo motif searches generated a refined description of the U-rich downstream sequence (DSE) element, which shows more divergence between the two species. These refined motifs are applied, within a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework, to predict mRNA cleavage sites.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:

Inhibitory activity of the Drosophila melanogaster serpin Necrotic is dependent on lysine residues in the D-helix,16835244,10.1074/jbc.M606085200,"Necrotic is a member of the serine protease inhibitor or serpin superfamily.

Necrotic contains three basic lysine residues within the D-helix that are homologous to those found in the heparin-binding domain of antithrombin and heparin co-factor II. We show here that substitution of all three lysine residues for glutamines caused cellular necrosis and premature death in Drosophila in keeping with a loss of function phenotype. The lysine to glutamine substitutions had no effect on the overall structure of recombinant Necrotic protein but abolished the formation of stable complexes with target proteases. Individual substitutions with either glutamine or alanine demonstrated that lysine 68 was the most critical residue for inhibitory activity. Despite the homology to other serpins, Necrotic did not bind, nor was it activated by sulfated glycans. These data demonstrate a critical role for basic residues within the D-helix (and lysine 68 in particular) in the inhibitory mechanism of the serpin Necrotic.",2006,"Andrew S Robertson, Didier Belorgey, David Gubb, Timothy R Dafforn, David A Lomas, Andrew S Robertson, Didier Belorgey, David Gubb, Timothy R Dafforn, David A Lomas"

These factors collectively predict lamin binding behavior, indicating that the nuclear lamina integrates variant and invariant chromatin features. Consistently, proximity of genomic regions to the nuclear lamina is partly conserved between cell types, and induction of gene expression or active histone marks reduces Lam binding. Lam target genes cluster in the genome, and these clusters are coordinately expressed during development.

Specifically, we use our approach to fit models using a smooth nonlinear formalism for modeling gene regulation (gene circuits) as well as models using logical rules based on activation and repression thresholds for transcription factors. Our technique also allows us to infer regulatory relationships de novo or to test network structures suggested by the literature. We fit a series of models to test several outstanding questions about gap gene regulation, including regulation of and by hunchback and the role of autoactivation. Based on our modeling results and validation against the experimental literature, we propose a revised network structure for the gap gene system.

Conserved arrangement of nested genes at the Drosophila Gart locus,3123310,,"The Drosophila melanogaster Gart gene encodes three enzymatic activities in the pathway for purine de novo synthesis. Alternative processing of the primary transcript leads to the synthesis of two overlapping polypeptides. The coding sequence for both polypeptides is interrupted by an intron that contains a functional cuticle protein gene encoded on the opposite DNA strand. Here we show that this nested organization also exists at the homologous locus of a distantly related species, Drosophila pseudoobscura. In both species, the intronic cuticle gene is expressed in wandering larvae and in prepupae. Remarkably, there are 24 different highly conserved noncoding segments within the intron containing the cuticle gene. These are found upstream of the transcriptional start, at the 3' end, and even within the single intronic gene intron. Other introns in the purine gene, including the intron at which alternative processing occurs, show no such homologies. It seems likely that at least some of the conserved noncoding regions are involved in specifying the high level developmental expression of the cuticle gene. We discuss the possibility that shared cis-acting regulatory sites might enhance transcription of both genes and help explain their nested arrangement.",1987,"S Henikoff, M K Eghtedarzadeh, S Henikoff, M K Eghtedarzadeh"

The MLC2 sequence at 99E1-3 appears to encode all of the isoforms of Drosophila MLC2. The polypeptide encoded at 99E was identified as MLC2 by the following criteria: the in vitro translation product is identical in size to MLC2 isolated from Drosophila muscle, and on two-dimensional gels the in vitro translation product can be separated into two or more peptides that co-migrate with isoforms of larval and thoracic MLC2. RNA encoding the polypeptide was detected in embryos only after the onset of muscle differentiation and was also abundant in adult thoracic muscle. The nucleotide sequence of cDNA generated from late embryonic RNA would be translated to yield a protein sequence with multiple regions of homology to vertebrate MLC2.

Restriction of P-element insertions at the Notch locus of Drosophila melanogaster,3037327,10.1128/mcb.7.4.1545,"P elements move about the Drosophila melanogaster genome in a nonrandom fashion, preferring some chromosomal targets for insertion over others (J.

Some of this specificity may be due to recognition of a particular DNA sequence in the target DNA; derivatives of an 8-base-pair consensus sequence are occupied by these transposable elements at many different chromosomal locations (K. O'Hare and G. M. Rubin, Cell 34:25-36, 1983). An additional level of specificity of P-element insertions is described in this paper. Of 14 mutations induced in the complex locus Notch by hybrid dysgenesis, 13 involved P-element insertions at or near the transcription start site of the gene. This clustering was not seen in other transposable element-induced mutations of Notch. DNA sequences homologous to the previously described consensus target for P-element insertion are not preferentially located in this region of the locus.

Parasite-induced enhancement of hemolymph tyrosinase activity in a selected immune reactive strain of Drosophila melanogaster,1932781,10.1002/arch.940180304,"Larval hemolymph tyrosinase activity in Drosophila melanogaster was detected with high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The enzyme hydroxylated L-tyrosine, and oxidized the diphenol substrates L-dopa and dopamine. In larvae of a selected immune-reactive strain the rates of tyrosine hydroxylation, dopa oxidation, and dopamine oxidation were markedly increased during the early stages of melanotic encapsulation of the eggs of the parasitic wasp Leptopilina boulardi. Tyrosinase activity was not modified in parasitized larvae of a selected susceptible strain of D. melanogaster, in which hosts the parasitoids developed unmolested. During the same period of parasitization, the amount of free tyrosine in immune reactive larvae was approximately three times higher than in susceptible hosts. These data indicate that the tyrosinase system of the immune reactive strain is activated during parasitization, and this results in the synthesis of some precursors which ultimately produce a melanotic and sclerotic capsule around the eggs of the parasite. Based on known genetic information of the enzyme system in Drosophila, it appears that at least two genes may be involved in the activation process, one associated with the proenzyme for monophenol oxidase activity, and the second with the proenzyme for diphenol oxidase activity.",1991,"A J Nappi, Y Carton, F Frey, A J Nappi, Y Carton, F Frey"
Distribution of hobo transposable elements in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster,1712890,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040649,"Forty-six strains derived from American and French natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster were tested for the presence and activity of hobo elements by using Southern blotting and a gonadal dysgenesis assay. The oldest available strains exhibited weak detectable hybridization to the hobo-element probe and revealed neither hobo-activity potential nor hobo-repression potential. In contrast, all recently collected strains harbored hobo sequences and revealed a strong hobo-repression potential but no strong hobo-activity potential. On the basis of restriction-enzyme analysis, old strains appear to have numerous fragments hybridizable to hobo sequences, several probably conserved at the same locations in the genome of the tested strain and others dispersed. In recently isolated strains, and unlike the situation in the published sequence of the cloned hobo108 element, a PvuII site is present in the great majority of full-sized hobo elements and their deletion derivatives. When the genetic and molecular characteristics are considered together, the available evidence is consistent with the hypothesis of a worldwide hobo-element invasion of D. melanogaster during the past 50 years. Comparison of data from the I-R and P-M systems suggests that the putative invasion followed the introduction of the I element but preceded that of the P element. This hypothesis poses the problem of the plausibility of three virtually simultaneous element invasions in this species. Such a possibility might be due to a modification of the genetic structure of American populations of D. melanogaster during the first part of the 20th century.",1991,"L Pascual, G Periquet, L Pascual, G Periquet"
Interspecific comparisons of the structure and regulation of the Drosophila ecdysone-inducible gene E74,2016053,,"The Drosophila melanogaster E74 gene is induced directly by the steroid hormone ecdysone and is a member of a small set of ""early"" genes that appear to trigger the onset of metamorphosis. The gene consists of three overlapping transcription units encoding two proteins, E74A and E74B, which possess a common C terminus. According to the Ashburner model for ecdysone's action, an E74 protein product potentially functions as a transcriptional activator of ""late"" genes as well as a repressor of early genes. We have taken an evolutionary approach to understand the function and regulation of E74 by isolating the homologous genes from Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila virilis and comparing them to D. melanogaster E74 sequences. Conserved characteristics of the E74 genes include ecdysone inducibility, localization to ecdysone-induced polytene chromosome puffs, and gene size. Amino acid sequence comparisons of the E74A protein reveal a highly conserved C-terminal region that is rich in basic amino acid residues and which has been proposed to possess sequence-specific DNA binding activity. The moderately conserved N-terminal region has maintained its overall acidic character and is a potential transcriptional activator domain. The central region contains conserved glutamine and alanine homopolymeric repeats of variable lengths.

The zfh-1 gene is expressed in the mesoderm of early embryos and in a number of mesodermally-derived structures of late embryos, including the dorsal vessel, support cells of the gonads, and segment-specific arrays of adult muscle precursors. In addition, zfh-1 is expressed in the majority of identified motor neurons of the developing CNS. The mesodermal zfh-1 expression requires the products of the twist and snail genes. The zfh-2 gene displays a more limited expression pattern, largely restricted to the CNS of late embryos. Ubiquitous zfh-1 expression in transgenic flies bearing an hsp70-zfh-1 construct has specific developmental consequences, including embryonic CNS defects as well as adult eye and bristle abnormalities. The expression patterns of zfh-1 and zfh-2 suggest that both genes may be involved in Drosophila neurogenesis and that zfh-1 may have additional functions in mesoderm development.",1991,"Z C Lai, M E Fortini, G M Rubin, Z C Lai, M E Fortini, G M Rubin"
[Non-random distribution of spontaneous and high temperature-induced recessive lethal mutations in the X-chromosome of Drosophila],1778461,,"Frequency and localization of spontaneous and induced by high temperature (37 degrees C) recessive lethal mutations in X-chromosome of females belonging to the 1(1) ts 403 strain defective in synthesis of heat-shock proteins (HSP) were studied. No differences in frequencies of both spontaneous and induced lethals between 1(1) ts 403 and control strain were found, thus implying that the disturbances in HSP synthesis have no effect on this process in oocytes of Drosophila melanogaster females. Surprisingly, distribution of spontaneous and induced lethals along the X-chromosome of 1(1) ts 403 strain appeared to be non-random: they primarily are located in its distal portion (1-44 cM of genetic map or in I-II sections of the Bridges cytogenetic map). This correlates with non-random distribution of mobile elements in the X-chromosome of D. melanogaster (Leibovich, 1990).",1991,"L A Mamon, L V Barabanova, L A Mamon, L V Barabanova"
Properties of photoreceptor-specific phospholipase C encoded by the norpA gene of Drosophila melanogaster,1662208,,"Mutations in the norpA gene drastically affect the phototransduction process in Drosophila. To study the biochemical characteristics of the norpA protein and its cellular and subcellular distributions, we have generated antisera against the major gene product of norpA. The antisera recognize an eye-specific protein of 130-kDa relative molecular mass that is present in wild-type head extracts but not in those of strong norpA mutants. The protein is associated with membranes and can be extracted with high salt. Immunohistochemical analysis at the light and electron microscopic levels indicates that the protein is expressed in all adult photoreceptor cells and specifically localized within the rhabdomeres, preferentially adjacent to, but not within, the rhabdomeric membranes. The results of the present study strongly support the previous suggestion that the norpA gene encodes the major phosphoinositol-specific phospholipase C in the photoreceptors. Moreover, insofar as the rhabdomeres are specialized structures for photoreception and phototransduction, specific localization of the norpA protein within these structures, in close association with the membranes, is consistent with the proposal that it has an important role in phototransduction.",1991,"S Schneuwly, M G Burg, C Lending, M H Perdew, W L Pak, S Schneuwly, M G Burg, C Lending, M H Perdew, W L Pak"
Expression of carbohydrate epitopes L2/HNK-1 and L3 in the larva and imago of Drosophila melanogaster and Calliphora vicina,1723933,10.1007/BF00340883,"The carbohydrate epitopes L2/HNK-1 and L3 belong to two overlapping families of adhesion molecules in the vertebrate, and probably the invertebrate nervous systems. To investigate their pattern of expression during the development of insects, cryosections of late third instar larvae and imagoes of Drosophila melanogaster and Calliphora vicina were studied by indirect immunofluorescence using several monoclonal antibodies to the L2/HNK-1 and one monoclonal antibody to the L3 epitope. Each monoclonal antibody to the L2/HNK-1 epitope showed a different immunohistological staining pattern, which differed from that of the L3 monoclonal antibody. In both insect species the immunohistological staining patterns for the two carbohydrate epitopes were similar at the two developmental stages, with immunoreactivity not confined to the nervous system. In larvae, immunoreactivities of the monoclonal antibodies L2.334 and L3.492 were predominantly associated with the extracellular matrix as indicated by co-localization with laminin, particularly in the imaginal discs, while L2.349 revealed a more cell surface-associated distribution. In imagoes, immunoreactivities were detectable in most organs studied.",1991,"R D Dennis, R Martini, M Schachner, R D Dennis, R Martini, M Schachner"
Organizational analysis of elav gene and functional analysis of ELAV protein of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis,1903840,10.1128/mcb.11.6.2994,"Drosophila virilis genomic DNA corresponding to the D. melanogaster embryonic lethal abnormal visual system (elav) locus was cloned. DNA sequence analysis of a 3.8-kb genomic piece allowed identification of (i) an open reading frame (ORF) with striking homology to the previously identified D. melanogaster ORF and (ii) conserved sequence elements of possible regulatory relevance within and flanking the second intron. Conceptual translation of the D. virilis ORF predicts a 519-amino-acid-long ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence-type protein. Similar to D. melanogaster ELAV protein, it contains three tandem RNA-binding domains and an alanine/glutamine-rich amino-terminal region. The sequence throughout the RNA-binding domains, comprising the carboxy-terminal 346 amino acids, shows an extraordinary 100% identity at the amino acid level, indicating a strong structural constraint for this functional domain. The amino-terminal region is 36 amino acids longer in D. virilis, and the conservation is 66%. In in vivo functional tests, the D. virilis ORF was indistinguishable from the D. melanogaster ORF. Furthermore, a D. melanogaster ORF encoding an ELAV protein with a 40-amino-acid deletion within the alanine/glutamine-rich region was also able to supply elav function in vivo. Thus, the divergence of the amino-terminal region of the ELAV protein reflects lowered functional constraint rather than species-specific functional specification.",1991,"K M Yao, K White, K M Yao, K White"
Effects of chemical and physical agents on recombination events in cells of the germ line of male and female Drosophila melanogaster,1658639,10.1016/0027-5107(91)90183-o,"Genotoxic agents can induce mutations as well as recombination in the genetic material. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster was one of the first assay systems to test physical and chemical agents for recombinogenic effects. Such effects can be observed in cells of the germ line as well as in somatic cells. At present information is available on 54 agents, among them 48 chemicals that have been tested in cells of the germ line of males and/or females. Effects on meiotic recombination in female germ cells cannot simply be classified as positive or negative since for a number of agents, depending on the chromosome region studied, recombination frequencies may be increased, unaffected or decreased. The male germ line of D. melanogaster represents a unique situation because meiotic recombination does not occur. Among 25 agents tested in male germ cells 24 did induce male recombination, among them alkylating, intercalating and cross-linking agents, direct-acting ones as well as compounds needing metabolic activation. With several compounds the frequency of induced recombination is highest in the heterochromatic regions near the centromeres. In brood pattern analyses, e.g., after exposure of adult males to ionizing radiation, the first appearance of crossover progeny is indicative of the sampling of exposed spermatocytes. In premeiotic cells of the male and the female germ line mitotic recombination can occur. Upon clonal expansion of the recombinant cells, clusters of identical crossovers can be observed.",1991,"F E WÃ¼rgler, F E WÃ¼rgler"
The complex genetic locus polyhomeotic in Drosophila melanogaster potentially encodes two homologous zinc-finger proteins,1937015,10.1016/0378-1119(91)90150-a,"Differential expression of the homeotic gene complexes, ANT-C and BX-C, of Drosophila melanogaster is partly controlled by trans-regulating factors located outside the two complexes. The complex genetic locus, polyhomeotic (ph), is one of these trans regulators required during development for correct expression of the homeotic selector genes. The ph locus comprises two genetically independent units whose functions are largely redundant. There are two duplicated sequences arranged as a tandem repeat in the ph region, defining two molecular ph units. Sequence analysis of the 28.6 kb of DNA comprising the locus shows varying degrees of sequence conservation between these two molecular units. Long open reading frames with a high degree of conservation have been localized in each tandem repeat. Putative protein products encoded by both the proximal and the distal unit contain several identical or practically identical protein domains: a zinc-finger-forming motif, an alpha-helix motif, a domain rich in serine and threonine residues and stretches of glutamine residues. The presence of these protein domains supports the hypothesis that ph encodes a transcription factor that may function as part of a protein complex. Possible molecular mechanisms leading to the particular structure of the locus are discussed.",1991,"J Deatrick, M Daly, N B Randsholt, H W Brock, J Deatrick, M Daly, N B Randsholt, H W Brock"
Molecular cloning and analysis of forked locus in Drosophila ananassae,1851948,10.1007/BF00273582,"Drosophila ananassae, in spite of its unique genetic characters including high mutability and high frequency of male recombination has been little studied at the molecular level. Since the species is very similar to D. melanogaster, it is natural to expect that the high spontaneous mutation rate and male recombination may be caused by inserted mobile DNA elements, as in D. melanogaster. The present study was designed to determine whether or not most spontaneous mutations of the forked locus of D. ananassae are caused by insertion sequences as is found in D. melanogaster. I cloned the forked locus of D. ananassae, using forked DNA from D. melanogaster as a probe and investigated the molecular structure and transcription of the gene by Southern and Northern analyses. The results suggest that the restriction map and transcriptional patterns of the forked locus of D. ananassae are similar to those of D. melanogaster, while the spontaneous mutations available in D. ananassae are induced quite differently from those that have been described in D. melanogaster; in four (f;cd, f10-14, f49 and f86) out of eight forked alleles, neither insertions nor deletions were detected around the forked coding region. Forked transcripts are expressed in a pattern which is very similar to that of D. melanogaster and were all of normal size in these mutants. The other four mutants (f10-3, f9-10, f83i and f79b) had insertion sequences upstream of the forked coding region, while transcripts of the forked gene were of normal size. Hence, none of the eight mutations studied appear to affect the structure of the forked transcripts.",1991,"Y Hatano, Y Hatano"

Possible horizontal transfer of Drosophila genes by the mite Proctolaelaps regalis,1653453,10.1126/science.1653453,"There is strong inferential evidence for recent horizontal gene transfer of the P (mobile) element to Drosophila melanogaster from a species of the Drosophila willistoni group. One potential vector of this transfer is a semiparasitic mite, Proctolaelaps regalis DeLeon, whose morphology, behavior, and co-occurrence with Drosophila are consistent with the properties necessary for such a vector. Southern blot hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, and DNA sequencing showed that samples of P. regalis associated with a P strain of D. melanogaster carried P element sequences. Similarly, Drosophila ribosomal DNA sequences were identified in P. regalis samples that had been associated with Drosophila cultures. These results have potentially important evolutionary implications, not only for understanding the mechanisms by which genes may be transferred between reproductively isolated species, but also for improved detection of some host-parasite and predator-prey relationships.",1991,"M A Houck, J B Clark, K R Peterson, M G Kidwell, M A Houck, J B Clark, K R Peterson, M G Kidwell"
The Drosophila Broad-Complex encodes a family of related proteins containing zinc fingers,1743483,,"The Broad-Complex (BR-C) is essential for metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster. This locus is coextensive with the 2B5 ecdysone-responsive early puff and is necessary for puffing and transcription of many subsequently activated late genes in the developing salivary gland. Mapping of 31 cDNA clones indicates that approximately 100 kb of the genome is devoted to the synthesis of many BR-C RNAs. Sequence analyses of these cDNA clones show that the BR-C encodes a family of related proteins characterized by a common core amino-terminal domain fused to alternate carboxy domains each containing a pair of zinc fingers. Most proteins also contain domains rich in distinctive amino acids located between the common core and zinc finger regions. BR-C mutant alleles resulting from chromosomal rearrangements at 2B5 are associated with deletions of 5'-untranslated sequences, separation of the core coding domain from the downstream zinc finger domains, or a P element insertional disruption of a zinc finger coding sequence. We infer that the BR-C directly regulates late gene expression by specifying the synthesis of a family of proteins with DNA binding potential.",1991,"P R DiBello, D A Withers, C A Bayer, J W Fristrom, G M Guild, P R DiBello, D A Withers, C A Bayer, J W Fristrom, G M Guild"

Ultrastructural analysis of polytene chromatin of Drosophila melanogaster reveals clusters of tightly linked co-expressed genes,1904022,10.1007/BF00337246,"Patterns of gene activity on individual chromatids of polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster white prepupae were ultrastructurally characterized by electron microscopy. The band-interband structure of salivary gland polytene chromosomes is lost when they are dispersed in a low ionic strength detergent solution. Morphologically similar, active genes in close proximity to one another were seen in dispersed white prepupal chromatin. The arrays of genes almost certainly represent sister copies of the same locus. Although lateral register between gene copies on multiple strands was not maintained, analysis of sister transcriptional units of unknown identity was achieved at the periphery of the chromatin arrays. Juxtaposed genes with divergent transcriptional polarity were prevalent. The morphology, size and transcriptional polarity of multiple copies of short, tandemly organized, RNA polymerase dense, co-expressed gene clusters is reported. One highly transcriptionally active region, designated the white prepupal locus (WPP locus), composed of a co-expressed tandem cluster of ten genes within an approximately 50 kb region was analyzed on six separate chromatids. The transcriptional map suggests that the pattern of gene activity for at least one gene within the cluster may not be identical on all homologous strands. The survey of active polytene genes provides ultrastructural correlation with previous molecular data that demonstrate tight linkage of certain developmentally co-regulated Drosophila genes.

The extra Y chromosome significantly increased the number of sternopleural bristles especially in the lateral areas of the sternopleura, which hampered the analysis of the effect of the extra Y chromosome on fluctuating asymmetry. The formula used was one which assumes that the fluctuating asymmetry is dependent on the total number of bristles. It was found that the extra Y chromosome increased fluctuating asymmetry at 18 degrees C but decreased it at 25 degrees C. There was less fluctuating asymmetry in females than in males. It appears that the extra Y chromosome has an effect on the temperature which is most favourable to the development of the sternopleural bristles.",1991,"P Jokela, P Portin, P Jokela, P Portin"

Biochemical and physiological studies of soluble esterases from Drosophila melanogaster,1747098,10.1007/BF00554144,"Twenty-two soluble esterases have been identified in D. melanogaster by combining the techniques of native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. The sensitivity of each isozyme to three types of inhibitors (organophosphates, eserine sulfate, and sulfydryl reagents) identified 10 as carboxylesterases, 6 as cholinesterases, and 3 as acetylesterases. Three isozymes could not be classified and no arylesterases were identified. The carboxyl- and cholinesterases could each be further divided into two subclasses on the basis of inhibition by organophosphates and sulfhydryl reagents, respectively. Choline- and acetylesterases have characteristic substrate preferences but both subclasses of carboxylesterases are heterogeneous in substrate utilization. Subclass 2 carboxylesterases exhibit diverse temporal expression patterns, with subclass 1 carboxylesterases generally found in larvae and subclass 1 cholinesterases and acetylesterases more characteristic of pupae and adults. Tissues showing the greatest number of isozymes are larval body wall (eight) and digestive tract (six in larvae, six in adults).

Relationship between general anesthesia and memory in Drosophila involving the cAMP/PKA pathways and adhesion-related molecules,17584057,10.2174/092986707780831140,"On undergoing an operation under general anesthesia, we tend to lose consciousness, and on recovering from the anesthetic effect, we realize a memory loss during the operation, but do remember the happenings before the operation. It implies that the anesthesia deprivers us of short-term memory without affecting long-term memory. Drosophila melanogaster is known to be an excellent model for genetic studies related to general anesthesia and memory. The various mutants in the genes related to general anesthesia and memory have been found to influence these mechanisms at the molecular level. In Drosophila, learning and memory are classified into four distinct phases: (1) short-term memory (STM), (2) middle-term memory (MTM), (3) longer-lasting anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM), and (4) long-term memory (LTM). On the other hand, based on the genetic studies of the putative target molecules of general anesthetics in model animals, the anesthetic action is classified into five pathways: (1) presynaptic pathway including action potential production, its transmission, and neurotransmitter release; (2) postsynaptic pathway including inhibitory receptors for sleep and pain; (3) memory pathway coupled with cAMP/PKA signaling; (4) adhesion pathway in neuron; and (5) energy production pathway. Memory and adhesion pathways of the anesthetic action are developed in the Drosophila melanogaster model. Many mutants of general anesthesia and those of memory are overlapped suggesting that common molecules and signal pathways are involved in both phenomena. In this review, we will describe the relation between anesthesia and memory, especially highlighting the interaction between the general anesthetics and STM and MTM processes in Drosophila, especially concentrating on the cAMP/PKA signaling and molecular adhesion pathways.",2007,"Yoshiharu Tanaka, Masaya Takase, Sumiko Gamo, Yoshiharu Tanaka, Masaya Takase, Sumiko Gamo"
Evolutionary conservation and divergence of the segmentation process in arthropods,17440988,10.1002/dvdy.21157,"A fundamental characteristic of the arthropod body plan is its organization in metameric units along the anterior-posterior axis. The segmental organization is laid down during early embryogenesis. Our view on arthropod segmentation is still strongly influenced by the huge amount of data available from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (the Drosophila paradigm). However, the simultaneous formation of the segments in Drosophila is a derived mode of segmentation. Successive terminal addition of segments from a posteriorly localized presegmental zone is the ancestral mode of arthropod segmentation. This review focuses on the evolutionary conservation and divergence of the genetic mechanisms of segmentation within arthropods. The more downstream levels of the segmentation gene network (e.g., segment polarity genes) appear to be more conserved than the more upstream levels (gap genes, Notch/Delta signaling). Surprisingly, the basally branched arthropod groups also show similarities to mechanisms used in vertebrate somitogenesis. Furthermore, it has become clear that the activation of pair rule gene orthologs is a key step in the segmentation of all arthropods. Important findings of conserved and diverged aspects of segmentation from the last few years now allow us to draw an evolutionary scenario on how the mechanisms of segmentation could have evolved and led to the present mechanisms seen in various insect groups including dipterans like Drosophila.",2007,"Wim G M Damen, Wim G M Damen"
Feeding Drosophila a biotin-deficient diet for multiple generations increases stress resistance and lifespan and alters gene expression and histone biotinylation patterns,17709434,10.1093/jn/137.9.2006,"Energy restriction increases stress resistance and lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster and other species. The roles of individual nutrients in stress resistance and longevity are largely unknown. The vitamin biotin is a potential candidate for mediating these effects, given its known roles in stress signaling and gene regulation by epigenetic mechanisms, i.e. biotinylation of histones. Here, we tested the hypothesis that prolonged culture of Drosophila on biotin-deficient (BD) medium increases stress resistance and lifespan. Flies were fed a BD diet for multiple generations; controls were fed a biotin-normal diet. In some experiments, a third group of flies was fed a BD diet for 12 generations and then switched to control diets for 2 generations to eliminate potential effects of short-term biotin deficiency. Flies fed a BD diet exhibited a 30% increase in lifespan. This increase was associated with enhanced resistance to the DNA-damaging agent hydroxyurea and heat stress. Also, fertility increased significantly compared with biotin-normal controls.

A significant difference in desiccation resistance was observed between the sexes, females were more resistant than males, but this relationship was reversed when taking into account body mass differences between the sexes. The degree of observed within-species variability demonstrates that studies focusing upon differences between species can produce different conclusions if they rely on observations for only single populations of a given species.

Moonlight shifts the endogenous clock of Drosophila melanogaster,17307880,10.1073/pnas.0606870104,"The ability to be synchronized by light-dark cycles is a fundamental property of circadian clocks. Although there are indications that circadian clocks are extremely light-sensitive and that they can be set by the low irradiances that occur at dawn and dusk, this has not been shown on the cellular level. Here, we demonstrate that a subset of Drosophila's pacemaker neurons responds to nocturnal dim light. At a nighttime illumination comparable to quarter-moonlight intensity, the flies increase activity levels and shift their typical morning and evening activity peaks into the night. In parallel, clock protein levels are reduced, and clock protein rhythms shift in opposed direction in subsets of the previously identified morning and evening pacemaker cells. No effect was observed on the peripheral clock in the eye. Our results demonstrate that the neurons driving rhythmic behavior are extremely light-sensitive and capable of shifting activity in response to the very low light intensities that regularly occur in nature. This sensitivity may be instrumental in adaptation to different photoperiods, as was proposed by the morning and evening oscillator model of Pittendrigh and Daan.

MC22 is a biallelic, nonrepetitive-length polymorphism 97 bp downstream of the scute transcript. It has been previously shown to be associated with sternopleural bristle number variation in both sexes in a set of isogenic lines. We replicated this association in a large cohort of wild-caught Drosophila melanogaster. We also detected a significant association at MC22 in an outbred population maintained under laboratory conditions for approximately 25 years, but the phenotypic effects in this sample were opposite from the direction estimated in the initial study. Finally, no significant associations were detected in a second large wild-caught cohort or in a set of 134 nearly isogenic lines. Our ability to repeat the initial association in wild samples suggests that it was not spurious.

Localization and characterization of X chromosome inversion breakpoints separating Drosophila mojavensis and Drosophila arizonae,17194790,10.1093/jhered/esl065,"Ectopic exchange between transposable elements or other repetitive sequences along a chromosome can produce chromosomal inversions. As a result, genome sequence studies typically find sequence similarity between corresponding inversion breakpoint regions.

We localize one inversion breakpoint to 13.7 kb and localize the other to a 1-Mb interval. Using this localization and assuming microsynteny between Drosophila melanogaster and D. arizonae, we pinpoint likely positions of the inversion breakpoints to windows of less than 3000 bp.

Regulation of Drosophila life span by olfaction and food-derived odors,17272684,10.1126/science.1136610,"Smell is an ancient sensory system present in organisms from bacteria to humans. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, gustatory and olfactory neurons regulate aging and longevity. Using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, we showed that exposure to nutrient-derived odorants can modulate life span and partially reverse the longevity-extending effects of dietary restriction. Furthermore, mutation of odorant receptor Or83b resulted in severe olfactory defects, altered adult metabolism, enhanced stress resistance, and extended life span. Our findings indicate that olfaction affects adult physiology and aging in Drosophila, possibly through the perceived availability of nutritional resources, and that olfactory regulation of life span is evolutionarily conserved.",2007,"Sergiy Libert, Jessica Zwiener, Xiaowen Chu, Wayne Vanvoorhies, Gregg Roman, Scott D Pletcher, Sergiy Libert, Jessica Zwiener, Xiaowen Chu, Wayne Vanvoorhies, Gregg Roman, Scott D Pletcher"
Aberrant monomethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 activates the DNA damage checkpoint in Drosophila melanogaster,17227890,10.1083/jcb.200607178,"PR-Set7 is a histone methyltransferase that specifically monomethylates histone H4 lysine 20 (K20) and is essential for cell proliferation. Our results show that in PR-Set7 mutants, the DNA damage checkpoint is activated. This phenotype is manifested by reduction in both the mitotic and the S phase indexes, a delay in the progression through early mitosis, and strong reduction of cyclin B. Furthermore, in a double mutant of PR-Set7 and mei-41 (the fly ATR orthologue), the abnormalities of mitotic progression and the cyclin B protein level were rescued. PR-Set7 also showed a defect in chromosome condensation that was enhanced in the double mutant. We therefore propose that monomethylated H4K20 is involved in the maintenance of proper higher order structure of DNA and is consequently essential for chromosome condensation.",2007,"Ayako Sakaguchi, Ruth Steward, Ayako Sakaguchi, Ruth Steward"
Drosophila hemopoiesis and cellular immunity,17404248,10.4049/jimmunol.178.8.4711,"In Drosophila melanogaster larvae, three classes of circulating cellular immune surveillance cells (hemocytes) can be identified: plasmatocytes, crystal cells, and lamellocytes. Plasmatocytes are professional phagocytes most similar to the mammalian monocyte/macrophage lineage and make up approximately 95% of circulating hemocytes. The other approximately 5% of circulating hemocytes consists of crystal cells, which secrete components necessary for the melanization of invading organisms, as well as for wound repair. A third cell type known as lamellocytes are rarely seen in healthy larvae and are involved in the encapsulation of invading pathogens. There are no obvious mammalian counterparts for crystal cells or lamellocytes, and there is no equivalent to the lymphoid lineage in insects. In this review, I will discuss what is currently known about Drosophila hemopoiesis and the cellular immune response and where possible compare it to vertebrate mechanisms.",2007,"Michael J Williams, Michael J Williams"
"SUUR joins separate subsets of PcG, HP1 and B-type lamin targets in Drosophila",17606990,10.1242/jcs.006007,"Drosophila melanogaster Suppressor of Under-Replication (SuUR) gene encodes a protein that modulates replicative properties of heterochromatin in endocycles of polytene cells. The SuUR mutation abolishes underreplication of intercalary heterochromatin and results in partial underreplication of pericentric heterochromatin. We performed a genome-wide mapping of SUUR target genes in non-polytenic Drosophila Kc cells by using the DamID approach. We show that SUUR preferentially binds genes that are transcriptionally silent and late-replicated. Distinct subsets of SUUR targets are associated with PcG proteins (Pc and Esc; Polycomb and Extra sexcombs), heterochromatic proteins [HP1 and SU(VAR)3-9] and B-type lamin. The SUUR binding profile negatively correlates with the DNA polytenization levels of salivary gland polytene chromosomes. Finally, SUUR target genes are repressed in Drosophila embryos and gradually activated later in development. Together these results suggest that SUUR is a ubiquitous marker of heterochromatin in different cell types.",2007,"Alexey V Pindyurin, Celine Moorman, Elzo de Wit, Stepan N Belyakin, Elena S Belyaeva, George K Christophides, Fotis C Kafatos, Bas van Steensel, Igor F Zhimulev, Alexey V Pindyurin, Celine Moorman, Elzo de Wit, Stepan N Belyakin, Elena S Belyaeva, George K Christophides, Fotis C Kafatos, Bas van Steensel, Igor F Zhimulev"
Model organisms and molecular genetics for endocrinology,17324417,10.1016/j.ygcen.2007.01.023,"Molecular endocrinology has revolutionised our understanding of neuroendocrine signalling. However, reductionist technologies emphasise the molecule at the expense of the organism. Can modern, post-genomic technologies also help us understand neuroendocrine signalling in the whole organism? The judicious use of genetic model organisms, and their associated genetic tools, can help this integrative approach. This theme is illustrated with the study of fluid balance in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This organism is a member of the Diptera, a large Order of the largest Class of life on earth (Insecta); one with a huge impact on human health and wealth. Advanced genetic technologies allow the modulation of function of individual genes in specific cells of otherwise normal tissues in a normal animal. This organotypic context is a prerequisite for integrative physiology. Such technologies have been exploited to generate the first animals transgenic for both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial calcium reporters, and to generate a transgenic toolkit that allows cAMP, cGMP or calcium to be manipulated in any cell or tissue of choice. The results have provided new insights into neuroendocrine control in Drosophila and other organisms.",2007,"Julian A T Dow, Julian A T Dow"

Effects of chronic exposure to dietary salicylate on elimination and renal excretion of salicylate by Drosophila melanogaster larvae,17601950,10.1242/jeb.003152,"The effects of chronic exposure to dietary salicylate on elimination and renal excretion of salicylate by D. melanogaster larvae were evaluated using salicylate-selective microelectrodes. Larvae chronically exposed to dietary salicylate showed 25% less salicylate in the haemolymph compared to the control group after feeding on a salicylate-enriched diet. By 1 h after transfer to a salicylate-free diet the levels of salicylate in the haemolymph of larvae raised on dietary salicylate were 46% lower than in the control group. Salicylate flux increased dramatically across Malpighian tubules but not across midgut or hindgut isolated from larvae chronically exposed to dietary salicylate, relative to the control group. Malpighian tubules isolated from experimental larvae showed a 4.7-fold increase in Kt and a nearly 5-fold increase in Jmax relative to the control. These changes in salicylate transport were accompanied by a 3.2-fold increase in fluid secretion rate. Moreover, the high rates of fluid secretion by the Malpighian tubules isolated from experimental larvae were stimulated 2.1-fold and 2.8-fold when tubules were challenged with 1 mmol l(-1) cAMP and 10 micromol l(-1) leucokinin I, respectively. Taken together, these results indicate that chronic exposure of D. melanogaster larvae to dietary salicylate alters elimination of such toxins from the haemolymph and increases the basal rate of fluid secretion and excretion of salicylate by the Malpighian tubules.",2007,"Esau Ruiz-Sanchez, Michael J O'Donnell, Esau Ruiz-Sanchez, Michael J O'Donnell"

Here we show for the first time that his methods had flaws, including the elimination of genetic variance, sampling biases, miscalculations of fitness variances, statistical pseudo-replication, and selective presentation of data. We conclude that Bateman's results are unreliable, his conclusions are questionable, and his observed variances are similar to those expected under random mating. Despite our analysis, we do not intend this article as a criticism of Bateman; he accomplished his work without modern computational tools, and his approach was groundbreaking emphasizing the significance of fitness variance for sexual selection. However, this reanalysis has implications for what counts as evidence for sexual selection and we believe that our concerns should be of interest to contemporary students of sexual selection.

A search for principles of disability using experimental impairment of Drosophila melanogaster,17118600,10.1016/j.exger.2006.10.002,The results of life table experiments to determine the effects of artificial impairment (leg amputation) in 7500 Drosophila melanogaster adults revealed that the extent to which life expectancy was reduced in impaired individuals was conditional on: (1) leg location and number amputated--front leg had greatest impact and the number of legs amputated directly correlated with mortality impact; (2) age of amputation--the greatest relative reduction in remaining life expectancy occurred when young flies were impaired; (3) vial orientation--mortality in impaired flies was the least when vials held upside-down (most friendly environment) and the greatest when they were right-side up (least friendly environment); and (4) sex--male mortality was increased more than female mortality in nearly all impairment treatments.

A single class of olfactory neurons mediates behavioural responses to a Drosophila sex pheromone,17392786,10.1038/nature05672,"Insects, like many other animals, use sex pheromones to coordinate their reproductive behaviours. Volatile pheromones are detected by odorant receptors expressed in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Whereas fruit odours typically activate multiple ORN classes, pheromones are thought to act through single dedicated classes of ORN. This model predicts that activation of such an ORN class should be sufficient to trigger the appropriate behavioural response. Here we show that the Drosophila melanogaster male-specific pheromone 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) acts through the receptor Or67d to regulate both male and female mating behaviour. Mutant males that lack Or67d inappropriately court other males, whereas mutant females are less receptive to courting males. These data suggest that cVA has opposite effects in the two sexes: inhibiting mating behaviour in males but promoting mating behaviour in females. Replacing Or67d with moth pheromone receptors renders these ORNs sensitive to the corresponding moth pheromones. In such flies, moth pheromones elicit behavioural responses that mimic the normal response to cVA. Thus, activation of a single ORN class is both necessary and sufficient to mediate behavioural responses to the Drosophila sex pheromone cVA.",2007,"Amina Kurtovic, Alexandre Widmer, Barry J Dickson, Amina Kurtovic, Alexandre Widmer, Barry J Dickson"
Odor and pheromone detection in Drosophila melanogaster,17205355,10.1007/s00424-006-0190-2,"Drosophila melanogaster has proven to be a useful model system to probe the mechanisms underlying the detection, discrimination, and perception of volatile odorants. The relatively small receptor repertoire of 62 odorant receptors makes the goal of understanding odor responses from the total receptor repertoire approachable in this system, and recent work has been directed toward this goal. In addition, new work not only sheds light but also raises more questions about the initial steps in odor perception in this system. Odorant receptor genes in Drosophila are predicted to encode seven transmembrane receptors, but surprising data suggest that these receptors may be inverted in the plasma membrane compared to classical G-protein coupled receptors. Finally, although some Drosophila odorant receptors are activated directly by odorant molecules, detection of a volatile pheromone, 11-cis vaccenyl acetate requires an extracellular adapter protein called LUSH for activation of pheromone sensitive neurons. Because pheromones are used by insects to trigger mating and other behaviors, these insights may herald new approaches to control behavior in pathogenic and agricultural pest insects.",2007,"Dean P Smith, Dean P Smith"

Novel eye-specific calmodulin methylation characterized by protein mapping in Drosophila melanogaster,17610210,10.1002/pmic.200700343,"Post-translational methylation of the epsilon-amino group of lysine residues regulates a number of protein functions. Calmodulin, a key modulator of intracellular calcium signaling, is methylated on lysine 115 in many species. Although the amino acid sequence of calmodulin is highly conserved in eukaryotes, it has been shown that lysine 115 is not methylated in Drosophila calmodulin and no other methylation site has been reported. In this study, we characterized in vivo modification states of Drosophila calmodulin using proteomic methodology involving the protein mapping of microdissected Drosophila tissues on 2-D gels. We found that Drosophila calmodulin was highly expressed in methylated forms in the compound eye, whereas its methylation was hardly detected in other tissues. We identified that lysine 94 located in an EF-hand III is the methylation site in Drosophila calmodulin. The predominance of methylated calmodulin in the compound eye may imply the involvement of calmodulin in photoreceptor-specific functions through methylation.",2007,"Nobuaki Takemori, Naoka Komori, James N Thompson Jr, Masa-Toshi Yamamoto, Hiroyuki Matsumoto, Nobuaki Takemori, Naoka Komori, James N Thompson Jr, Masa-Toshi Yamamoto, Hiroyuki Matsumoto"

Climatic selection on genes and traits after a 100 year-old invasion: a critical look at the temperate-tropical clines in Drosophila melanogaster from eastern Australia,16955331,10.1007/s10709-006-9010-z,"Drosophila melanogaster invaded Australia around 100 years ago, most likely through a northern invasion. The wide range of climatic conditions in eastern Australia across which D. melanogaster is now found provides an opportunity for researchers to identify traits and genes that are associated with climatic adaptation. Allozyme studies indicate clinal patterns for at least four loci including a strong linear cline in Adh and a non-linear cline in alpha-Gpdh. Inversion clines were initially established from cytological studies but have now been validated with larger sample sizes using molecular markers for breakpoints. Recent collections indicate that some genetic markers (Adh and In(3R)Payne) have changed over the last 20 years reflecting continuing evolution. Heritable clines have been established for quantitative traits including wing length/area, thorax length and cold and heat resistance. A cline in egg size independent of body size and a weak cline in competitive ability have also been established. Postulated clinal patterns for resistance to desiccation and starvation have not been supported by extensive sampling. Experiments under laboratory and semi-natural conditions have suggested selective factors generating clinal patterns, particularly for reproductive patterns over winter. Attempts are being made to link clinal variation in traits to specific genes using QTL analysis and the candidate locus approach, and to identify the genetic architecture of trait variation along the cline. This is proving difficult because of inversion polymorphisms that generate disequilibrium among genes. Substantial gaps still remain in linking clines to field selection and understanding the genetic and physiological basis of the adaptive shifts. However D. melanogaster populations in eastern Australia remain an excellent resource for understanding past and future evolutionary responses to climate change.",2007,"Ary A Hoffmann, Andrew R Weeks, Ary A Hoffmann, Andrew R Weeks"

Despite being expressed in a variety of tissues, most of the work on SD has been restricted to understanding its role and function in patterning the adult wing. To gain a better understanding of its role in development, we generated sd(47M) flip-in mitotic clones. The mitotic clones had developmental defects in the leg and eye. Further, by removing the VG domains involved in activation, we created a reagent (VGDeltaACT) that disrupts the ability of SD to form a functional transcription factor complex and produced similar phenotypes to the flip-in mitotic clones. The VGDeltaACT construct also disrupted adult CNS development. Expression of the VGDeltaACT construct in the wing alters the cellular localization of VG and produces a mutant phenotype, indicating that the construct is able to antagonize the normal function of the SD/VG complex. Expression of the protein:protein interaction portion of SD is also able to elicit similar phenotypes, suggesting that SD interacts with other cofactors in the leg, eye, and adult CNS. Furthermore, antagonizing SD in larval tissues results in cell death, indicating that SD may also have a role in cell survival.",2007,"Ankush Garg, Ajay Srivastava, Monica M Davis, Sandra L O'Keefe, Leola Chow, John B Bell, Ankush Garg, Ajay Srivastava, Monica M Davis, Sandra L O'Keefe, Leola Chow, John B Bell"

We found several such genes, which show testis-biased expression and are often X-linked. Comparative data indicate that three of these genes have very short open reading frames, which suggests the possibility that a significant number of testis-biased de novo genes in the D. yakuba/D. erecta clade may be noncoding RNA genes. These data, along with previously published data from D. melanogaster, support the idea that many de novo Drosophila genes function in male reproduction and that a small region of the X chromosome in the melanogaster subgroup may be a hotspot for the evolution of novel testis-biased genes.",2007,"David J Begun, Heather A Lindfors, Andrew D Kern, Corbin D Jones, David J Begun, Heather A Lindfors, Andrew D Kern, Corbin D Jones"

"Cloning, expression and characterization of a dipteran farnesyl diphosphate synthase",17916506,10.1016/j.ibmb.2007.07.011,"Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) of the dipteran Drosophila melanogaster has been cloned and its catalytic properties have been assessed. Analysis of the D. melanogaster genome and of ESTs indicates that FPPS is a single copy gene that produces two transcripts, which differ only by 5' extension. The cDNA of shorter and longer D. melanogaster FPPSs (DmFPPS-1a and DmFPPS-1b, respectively) were each subcloned into pET28a and expressed as an N-His6 fusion protein in BL21 E. coli cells. The DmFPPSs similarly catalyzed the coupling of the allylic substrates, GPP and DMAPP, with IPP, producing FPP as product. The longer protein was further characterized. The enzyme required divalent metal for activity, and was activated by 0.1% Triton X-100. Higher detergent concentration and the addition of glycerol, conditions that activate certain insect FPPSs, inhibited prenyl coupling by DmFPPS-1b. Although DmFPPS-1b does not efficiently couple homologous GPP compounds, homodimethylallyl diphosphate (HDMAPP), which is precursor to all homologous JH structures, was a reactive substrate.",2007,"Stephanie E Sen, Corey Trobaugh, Catherine BÃ©liveau, Thenesha Richard, Michel Cusson, Stephanie E Sen, Corey Trobaugh, Catherine BÃ©liveau, Thenesha Richard, Michel Cusson"
Preliminary characterization of hemolymph coagulation in Anopheles gambiae larvae,17287020,10.1016/j.dci.2006.12.006,"Hemolymph coagulation is a first response to injury, impeding infection, and ending bleeding. Little is known about its molecular basis in insects, but clotting factors have been identified in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we have begun to study coagulation in the aquatic larvae of the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles gambiae using methods developed for Drosophila. A delicate clot was seen by light microscopy, and pullout and proteomic analysis identified phenoloxidase and apolipophorin-I as major candidate clotting factors. Electron microscopic analysis confirmed clot formation and revealed it contains fine molecular sheets, most likely a result of lipophorin assembly. Phenoloxidase appears to be more critical in clot formation in Anopheles than in Drosophila. The Anopheles larval clot thus differs in formation, structure, and composition from the clot in Drosophila, confirming the need to study coagulation in different insect species to learn more about its evolution and adaptation to different lifestyles.",2007,"Bogos Agianian, Christine Lesch, Olga Loseva, Mitchell S Dushay, Bogos Agianian, Christine Lesch, Olga Loseva, Mitchell S Dushay"
Joint estimates of quantitative trait locus effect and frequency using synthetic recombinant populations of Drosophila melanogaster,17435224,10.1534/genetics.106.069641,"We develop and implement a strategy to map QTL in two synthetic populations of Drosophila melanogaster each initiated with eight inbred founder strains. These recombinant populations allow simultaneous estimates of QTL location, effect, and frequency. Five X-linked QTL influencing bristle number were resolved to intervals of approximately 1.3 cM. We confirm previous observations of bristle number QTL distal to 4A at the tip of the chromosome and identify two novel QTL in 7F-8C, an interval that does not include any classic bristle number candidate genes. If QTL at the tip of the X are biallelic they appear to be intermediate in frequency, although there is evidence that these QTL may reside in multiallelic haplotypes. Conversely, the two QTL mapping to the middle of the X chromosome are likely rare: in each case the minor allele is observed in only 1 of the 16 founders. Assuming additivity and biallelism we estimate that identified QTL contribute 1.0 and 8.7%, respectively, to total phenotypic variation in male abdominal and sternopleural bristle number in nature. Models that seek to explain the maintenance of genetic variation make different predictions about the population frequency of QTL alleles. Thus, mapping QTL in eight-way recombinant populations can distinguish between these models.",2007,"Stuart J Macdonald, Anthony D Long, Stuart J Macdonald, Anthony D Long"

An evolutionary cost of separate genders revealed by male-limited evolution,17206582,10.1086/509941,"Theory predicts that intralocus sexual conflict can constrain the evolution of sexual dimorphism, preventing each sex from independently maximizing its fitness. To test this idea, we limited genome-wide gene expression to males in four replicate Drosophila melanogaster populations, removing female-specific selection. Over 25 generations, male fitness increased markedly, as sexually dimorphic traits evolved in the male direction. When male-evolved genomes were expressed in females, their fitness displayed a nearly symmetrical decrease. These results suggest that intralocus conflict strongly limits sex-specific adaptation, promoting the maintenance of genetic variation for fitness. Populations may carry a heavy genetic load as a result of selection for separate genders.",2007,"N G Prasad, S Bedhomme, T Day, A K Chippindale, N G Prasad, S Bedhomme, T Day, A K Chippindale"
Cell lineage-specific expression and function of the empty spiracles gene in adult brain development of Drosophila melanogaster,17314131,10.1242/dev.02814,"The empty spiracles (ems) gene, encoding a homeodomain transcription factor, is a member of the cephalic gap gene family that acts in early specification of the anterior neuroectoderm in the embryonic brain of Drosophila. Here we show that ems is also expressed in the mature adult brain in the lineage-restricted clonal progeny of a single neuroblast in each brain hemisphere. These ems-expressing neuronal cells are located ventral to the antennal lobes and project a fascicle to the superior medial protocerebrum. All adult-specific secondary neurons in this lineage persistently express ems during postembryonic larval development and continue to do so throughout metamorphosis and into the adult. Mosaic-based MARCM mutant analysis and genetic rescue experiments demonstrate that ems function is autonomously required for the correct number of cells in the persistently expressing adult-specific lineage. Moreover, they indicate that ems is also required cell autonomously for the formation of the correct projections in this specific lineage. This analysis of ems expression and function reveals novel and unexpected roles of a cephalic gap gene in translating lineage information into cell number control and projection specificity in an individual clonal unit of the adult brain.",2007,"Robert Lichtneckert, Bruno Bello, Heinrich Reichert, Robert Lichtneckert, Bruno Bello, Heinrich Reichert"
Regulation of the activity of the tumor suppressor PTEN by thioredoxin in Drosophila melanogaster,17316609,10.1016/j.yexcr.2007.01.004,"Human Thioredoxin-1 (hTrx-1) is a small redox protein with a molecular weight of 12 kDa that contains two cysteine residues found in its catalytic site. HTrx-1 plays an important role in cell growth, apoptosis, and cancer patient prognosis. Recently, we have demonstrated that hTrx-1 binds to the C2 domain of the human tumor suppressor, PTEN, in a redox dependent manner. This binding leads to the inhibition of PTEN lipid phosphatase activity in mammalian tissue culture systems. In this study, we show that over-expression of hTrx-1 in Drosophila melanogaster promotes cell growth and proliferation during eye development as measured by eye size and ommatidia size. Furthermore, hTrx-1 rescues the small eye phenotype induced by the over-expression of PTEN. We demonstrate that this rescue of the PTEN-induced eye size phenotype requires cysteine-218 in the C2 domain of PTEN. We also show that hTrx-1 over-expression results in increased Akt phosphorylation in fly head extracts supporting our observations that the hTrx-1-induced eye size increase results from the inhibition of PTEN activity. Our study confirms the redox regulation of PTEN through disulfide bond formation with the hTrx-1 in Drosophila and suggests conserved mechanisms for thioredoxins and their interactions with the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase signaling pathway in humans and fruit flies.",2007,"Zuohe Song, Negin Saghafi, Vijay Gokhale, Marc Brabant, Emmanuelle J Meuillet, Zuohe Song, Negin Saghafi, Vijay Gokhale, Marc Brabant, Emmanuelle J Meuillet"
Oskar controls morphology of polar granules and nuclear bodies in Drosophila,17151014,10.1242/dev.02729,"Germ cell formation in Drosophila relies on polar granules, which are large ribonucleoprotein complexes found at the posterior end of the embryo. The granules undergo characteristic changes in morphology during development, including the assembly of multiple spherical bodies from smaller precursors. Several polar granule components, both protein and RNA, have been identified. One of these, the protein Oskar, acts to initiate granule formation during oogenesis and to recruit other granule components. To investigate whether Oskar has a continuing role in organization of the granules and control of their morphology, we took advantage of species-specific differences in polar granule structure. The polar granules of D. immigrans fuse into a single large oblong aggregate, as opposed to the multiple, distinct, spherical granules of D. melanogaster embryos. D. immigrans oskar rescues the body patterning and pole cell defects of embryos from D. melanogaster oskar(-) mothers, and converts the morphology of the polar granules to that of D. immigrans. The nuclear bodies, which are structures that appear to be closely related to polar granules, are also converted to the D. immigrans type morphology. We conclude that oskar plays a persistent and central role in the polar granules, not only initiating their formation but also controlling their organization and morphology.",2007,"Jennifer R Jones, Paul M Macdonald, Jennifer R Jones, Paul M Macdonald"
Drosophila spermatogenesis: insights into testicular cancer,17573852,10.1111/j.1365-2605.2007.00767.x,"Geneticists have a long history of studying reproduction in the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, and in recent years it has become apparent that many of the genes that regulate invertebrate reproduction have been conserved through vertebrate evolution. As with other higher eukaryotes, spermatogenesis in Drosophila is characterized by a regenerative germline stem cell population that divides asymmetrically to produce mitotic spermatogonia which will eventually differentiate into spermatocytes. Germline tumours consisting of undifferentiated germ cells have been associated with both loss-of-function mutations and ectopic gene expression. While the genesis of these tumours may not be identical to human germ cell tumours many of the genes that regulate stem cell proliferation and aberrant over-proliferation in the Drosophila testis provide candidate molecules that may underlie the genetic programmes that contribute to human testicular oncogenesis.",2007,"G R Hime, K L Loveland, H E Abud, G R Hime, K L Loveland, H E Abud"
Classical reward conditioning in Drosophila melanogaster,16740144,10.1111/j.1601-183X.2006.00241.x,"Negatively reinforced olfactory conditioning has been widely employed to identify learning and memory genes, signal transduction pathways and neural circuitry in Drosophila. To delineate the molecular and cellular processes underlying reward-mediated learning and memory, we developed a novel assay system for positively reinforced olfactory conditioning. In this assay, flies were involuntarily exposed to the appetitive unconditioned stimulus sucrose along with a conditioned stimulus odour during training and their preference for the odour previously associated with sucrose was measured to assess learning and memory capacities. After one training session, wild-type Canton S flies displayed reliable performance, which was enhanced after two training cycles with 1-min or 15-min inter-training intervals. Higher performance scores were also obtained with increasing sucrose concentration. Memory in Canton S flies decayed slowly when measured at 30 min, 1 h and 3 h after training; whereas, it had declined significantly at 6 h and 12 h post-training. When learning mutant t beta h flies, which are deficient in octopamine, were challenged, they exhibited poor performance, validating the utility of this assay. As the Drosophila model offers vast genetic and transgenic resources, the new appetitive conditioning described here provides a useful tool with which to elucidate the molecular and cellular underpinnings of reward learning and memory. Similar to negatively reinforced conditioning, this reward conditioning represents classical olfactory conditioning. Thus, comparative analyses of learning and memory mutants in two assays may help identify the molecular and cellular components that are specific to the unconditioned stimulus information used in conditioning.",2007,"Y-C Kim, H-G Lee, K-A Han, Y-C Kim, H-G Lee, K-A Han"

Monitoring miRNA-mediated silencing in Drosophila melanogaster S2-cells,18634912,10.1016/j.bbagrm.2008.06.008,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small cellular RNAs that participate in post-transcriptional gene regulation.

In this study, we have compared expression strategies for miRNA-activity reporter constructs and have examined the dependence of silencing by a particular Drosophila miRNA, bantam, on specific argonaute proteins. Consistent with previous biochemical experiments, we found that bantam silencing is strongly dependent on Ago1, but in addition we could detect the activity of Ago2-loaded bantam. Our experiments suggest that a perfectly complementary design and a transient expression strategy for reporter constructs may--in the case of catalytically active Ago-proteins--lead to a disproportionately strong response mediated by a minor fraction of silencing complexes. We present evidence that Drosophila S2-cells of independent sources differ in their RNAi efficiency in response to dsRNA added to the growth medium, and that the selection antibiotic G418 acts as an inhibitor of RNAi induced by soaking.",2008,"Claudio Shah, Klaus FÃ¶rstemann, Claudio Shah, Klaus FÃ¶rstemann"

Programmed cell death of primordial germ cells in Drosophila is regulated by p53 and the Outsiders monocarboxylate transporter,18057102,10.1242/dev.010389,"Primordial germ cell development uses programmed cell death to remove abnormal, misplaced or excess cells. Precise control of this process is essential to maintain the continuity and integrity of the germline, and to prevent germ cells from colonizing locations other than the gonads. Through careful analyses of primordial germ cell distribution in developing Drosophila melanogaster embryos, we show that normal germ cell development involves extensive programmed cell death during stages 10-12 of embryogenesis. This germ cell death is mediated by Drosophila p53 (p53). Mutations in p53 result in excess primordial germ cells that are ectopic to the gonads. Initial movements of the germ cells appear normal, and wild-type numbers of germ cells populate the gonads, indicating that p53 is required for germ cell death, but not migration. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a loss-of-function phenotype for Drosophila p53 in a non-sensitized background. The p53 phenotype is remarkably similar to that of outsiders (out) mutants. Here, we show that the out gene encodes a putative monocarboxylate transporter. Mutations in p53 and out show nonallelic noncomplementation. Interestingly, overexpression of p53 in primordial germ cells of out mutant embryos partially suppresses the out germ cell death phenotype, suggesting that p53 functions in germ cells either downstream of out or in a closely linked pathway. These findings inform models in which signaling between p53 and cellular metabolism are integrated to regulate programmed cell death decisions.",2008,"Yukiko Yamada, Keri D Davis, Clark R Coffman, Yukiko Yamada, Keri D Davis, Clark R Coffman"

Akirin is highly conserved, and the human genome contains two homologs, one of which was able to rescue the loss-of-function phenotype in drosophila cells. Akirins were strictly localized to the nucleus. Knockout of both Akirin homologs in mice showed that one had an essential function downstream of the Toll-like receptor, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin (IL)-1beta signaling pathways leading to the production of IL-6.

Superoxide dismutase overexpression protects dopaminergic neurons in a Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease,18243716,10.1016/j.nbd.2007.11.013,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Some of the inherited forms of the disease are caused by mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene and the triplication of its locus. Oxidative stress has been proposed as a central mechanism for the progression of the disease although its relation with alpha-synuclein toxicity remains obscure. Targeted expression of human alpha-synuclein has been effectively used to recreate the pathology of PD in Drosophila melanogaster and it has been proved an excellent tool for the study of testable hypothesis in relation to the disease. We show that dopaminergic neurons are specifically sensitive to hyperoxia induced oxidative stress and that mutant forms of alpha-synuclein show an enhanced toxicity under these conditions suggesting synergic interactions. In addition, the co-expression of Cu/Zn superoxid dismutase protects against the dopaminergic neuronal loss induced by mutant alpha-synuclein overexpression thus identifying oxidative stress as an important causative factor in the pathology of autosomal-dominant Parkinsonism.",2008,"Jose A Botella, Florian Bayersdorfer, Stephan Schneuwly, Jose A Botella, Florian Bayersdorfer, Stephan Schneuwly"
Neurogenetic networks for startle-induced locomotion in Drosophila melanogaster,18713854,10.1073/pnas.0804889105,"Understanding how the genome empowers the nervous system to express behaviors remains a critical challenge in behavioral genetics. The startle response is an attractive behavioral model for studies on the relationship between genes, brain, and behavior, as the ability to respond rapidly to harmful changes in the environment is a universal survival trait. Drosophila melanogaster provides a powerful system in which genetic studies on individuals with controlled genetic backgrounds and reared under controlled environmental conditions can be combined with neuroanatomical studies to analyze behaviors. In a screen of 720 lines of D. melanogaster, carrying single P[GT1] transposon insertions, we found 267 lines that showed significant changes in startle-induced locomotor behavior. Excision of the transposon reversed this effect in five lines out of six tested. We infer that most of the 267 lines show mutant effects on startle-induced locomotion that are caused by the transposon insertions. We selected a subset of 15 insertions in the same genetic background in autosomal genes with strong mutant effects and crossed them to generate all 105 possible nonreciprocal double heterozygotes. These hybrids revealed an extensive network of epistatic interactions on the behavioral trait. In addition, we observed changes in neuroanatomy that were caused by these 15 mutations, individually and in their double heterozygotes. We find that behavioral and neuroanatomical phenotypes are determined by a common set of genes that are organized as partially overlapping genetic networks.",2008,"Akihiko Yamamoto, Liesbeth Zwarts, Patrick Callaerts, Koenraad Norga, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt, Akihiko Yamamoto, Liesbeth Zwarts, Patrick Callaerts, Koenraad Norga, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt"

Australin: a chromosomal passenger protein required specifically for Drosophila melanogaster male meiosis,18268101,10.1083/jcb.200708072,"The chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), which is composed of conserved proteins aurora B, inner centromere protein (INCENP), survivin, and Borealin/DASRA, localizes to chromatin, kinetochores, microtubules, and the cell cortex in a cell cycle-dependent manner. The CPC is required for multiple aspects of cell division. Here we find that Drosophila melanogaster encodes two Borealin paralogues, Borealin-related (Borr) and Australin (Aust). Although Borr is a passenger in all mitotic tissues studied, it is specifically replaced by Aust for the two male meiotic divisions. We analyzed aust mutant spermatocytes to assess the effects of fully inactivating the Aust-dependent functions of the CPC. Our results indicate that Aust is required for sister chromatid cohesion, recruitment of the CPC to kinetochores, and chromosome alignment and segregation but not for meiotic histone phosphorylation or spindle formation.

Ion transport peptide splice forms in central and peripheral neurons throughout postembryogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster,18418898,10.1002/cne.21715,"Ion transport peptides (ITPs) belong to a large arthropod neuropeptide family including crustacean hyperglycaemic hormones and are antidiuretic hormones in locusts. Because long and short ITP isoforms are generated by alternative splicing from a single gene in locusts and moths, we investigated whether similarly spliced gene products occur in the nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster throughout postembryogenesis. The itp gene CG13586 was reanalyzed, and we found three instead of the two previously annotated alternatively spliced mRNAs. These give rise to three different neuropeptides, two long C-terminally carboxylated isoforms (DrmITPL1 and DrmITPL2, both 87 amino acids) and one short amidated DrmITP (73 amino acids), which were partially identified biochemically.

The neurosecretory neurons persist throughout postembryogenesis, form release sites in corpora cardiaca, and invade corpora allata. One type of ITP-expressing interneuron exists only in the larval and prepupal subesophageal ganglia, whereas three types of interneurons in the adult brain arise in late pupae and invade circumscribed neuropils in superior median and lateral brain areas. One peripheral bipolar and putative sensory neuron type occurs in the larval, pupal, and adult preterminal abdominal segments. Although the neurosecretory neurons may release DrmITP and DrmITPL2 into the haemolymph, possible physiological roles of the hindgut-innervating and peripheral neurons as well as the interneurons are yet to be identified.",2008,"Heinrich Dircksen, Lily Kahsai Tesfai, Christina Albus, Dick R NÃ¤ssel, Heinrich Dircksen, Lily Kahsai Tesfai, Christina Albus, Dick R NÃ¤ssel"

Drosophila short neuropeptide F signalling regulates growth by ERK-mediated insulin signalling,18344986,10.1038/ncb1710,"Insulin and insulin growth factor have central roles in growth, metabolism and ageing of animals, including Drosophila melanogaster. In Drosophila, insulin-like peptides (Dilps) are produced by specialized neurons in the brain. Here we show that Drosophila short neuropeptide F (sNPF), an orthologue of mammalian neuropeptide Y (NPY), and sNPF receptor sNPFR1 regulate expression of Dilps. Body size was increased by overexpression of sNPF or sNPFR1. The fat body of sNPF mutant Drosophila had downregulated Akt, nuclear localized FOXO, upregulated translational inhibitor 4E-BP and reduced cell size. Circulating levels of glucose were elevated and lifespan was also extended in sNPF mutants. We show that these effects are mediated through activation of extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK) in insulin-producing cells of larvae and adults. Insulin expression was also increased in an ERK-dependent manner in cultured Drosophila central nervous system (CNS) cells and in rat pancreatic cells treated with sNPF or NPY peptide, respectively.

"Identification of the Drosophila melanogaster mitochondrial citrate carrier: bacterial expression, reconstitution, functional characterization and developmental distribution",18515854,10.1093/jb/mvn076,"The mitochondrial carriers are a family of transport proteins that shuttle metabolites, nucleotides and cofactors across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The genome of Drosophila melanogaster encodes at least 46 members of this family. Only four of them have been characterized: the two isoforms of the ADP/ATP translocase, the brain uncoupling protein and the carnitine/acylcarnitine carriers. The transport functions of the remainders cannot be assessed with certainty. One of them, the product of the gene CG6782, shows a fairly close sequence homology to the known sequence of the rat mitochondrial citrate carrier. In this article the fruit fly protein coding by the CG6782 gene has been functionally characterized by over-expression in Escherichia coli and reconstitution into liposomes. It shows to have similar transport properties of the eukaryotic mitochondrial citrate carriers previously biochemically characterized. This indicates that in addition to the protein sequence conservation, insect and mammalian citrate carriers are also significantly related at the functional level suggesting that Drosophila may be used as model organism for the study of mitochondrial solute transporter.

Porin isoform 2 has a different localization in Drosophila melanogaster ovaries than porin 1,18686020,10.1007/s10863-008-9149-7,"Eukaryotic porins or VDACs are a class of transmembrane proteins mainly localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane, whose function is to allow the diffusion of metabolites between the cytosol and the mitochondrion. In Drosophila melanogaster, as in other organisms, a small family of genes encoding porins has been discovered from the sequence of the genome. It is of general interest to understand whether these genes represent functional entities or not, and whether their product is associated to any particular tissue. In previous work we reported about the transcriptional and translational analysis of porin 1 and porin 2, and we proposed the specific presence of the latter in spermatozoa of the fly. In this paper we performed real time RT-PCR quantification of porin 1 and porin 2 transcripts in germ cells of the fly. It indicates that Porin 1 is abundantly expressed in both male and female tissues; Porin 2 instead, is very abundant in testis and it is present in ovaries as well, but in a small amount. The immuno-histological stain of ovaries shows that Porin isoform 1 is selectively targeted to follicular cells while Porin isoform 2 is present in mitochondria of the epithelial sheath cells of the ovariole.

We have studied the visual system of Drosophila melanogaster in which histamine is the primary neurotransmitter released from photoreceptor cells. We report here that a novel mRNA splice variant of Drosophila VMAT (DVMAT-B) is expressed not in neurons but rather in a small subset of glia in the lamina of the fly's optic lobe.

"The gene structure of the Drosophila melanogaster proto-oncogene, kayak, and its nested gene, fos-intronic gene",18571877,10.1016/j.gene.2008.05.001,"We present herein a new model for the structure of the Drosophila kayak gene as well as preliminary data on the functional differences of its various isoforms. kayak is a homolog of the human proto-oncogene, c-fos. kayak has three different starts of transcription, and therefore promoters (P)kay-alpha, (P)kay-beta and (P)kay-gamma. These three promoters lead to four different transcripts: kay-alpha, kay(sro), kay-beta and kay-gamma. (P)kay-alpha produces two different transcripts: kay-alpha and kay(sro) where the other two promoters, (P)kay-beta and (P)kay-gamma, produce a single transcript each. The transcripts kay-alpha, beta and gamma all splice into the mainbody of the kay gene, which codes for the DNA binding domain and leucine zipper; kay(sro) is not spliced. Also, within this region is a nested gene, fos-intronic gene (fig) which is transcribed in the opposite direction. fig codes for a predicted PP2C phosphatase. fig has two different promoters which produce two different transcripts, both in the same reading frame, fig-alpha and beta. This is an unusual gene structure for Drosophila. Only 13% of Drosophila genes have multiple promoters and only 7% have a nested gene. RT-PCR was performed on each transcript to determine the relative amounts of each RNA produced. All spliced kay transcripts appear to have equal abundance. The unspliced kay(sro) transcript has a lower abundance than kay-alpha. Both fig transcripts are also detected in all stages tested.

Effector caspase Dcp-1 and IAP protein Bruce regulate starvation-induced autophagy during Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis,18794330,10.1083/jcb.200712091,"A complex relationship exists between autophagy and apoptosis, but the regulatory mechanisms underlying their interactions are largely unknown.

During D. melanogaster oogenesis, we found that autophagy is induced at two nutrient status checkpoints: germarium and mid-oogenesis. At these two stages, the effector caspase Dcp-1 and the inhibitor of apoptosis protein Bruce function to regulate both autophagy and starvation-induced cell death. Mutations in Atg1 and Atg7 resulted in reduced DNA fragmentation in degenerating midstage egg chambers but did not appear to affect nuclear condensation, which indicates that autophagy contributes in part to cell death in the ovary.

On the origin of new genes in Drosophila,18550802,10.1101/gr.076588.108,"Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the origination of new genes. Despite extensive case studies, the general principles governing this fundamental process are still unclear at the whole-genome level. Here, we unveil genome-wide patterns for the mutational mechanisms leading to new genes and their subsequent lineage-specific evolution at different time nodes in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup. We find that (1) tandem gene duplication has generated approximately 80% of the nascent duplicates that are limited to single species (D. melanogaster or Drosophila yakuba); (2) the most abundant new genes shared by multiple species (44.1%) are dispersed duplicates, and are more likely to be retained and be functional; (3) de novo gene origination from noncoding sequences plays an unexpectedly important role during the origin of new genes, and is responsible for 11.9% of the new genes; (4) retroposition is also an important mechanism, and had generated approximately 10% of the new genes; (5) approximately 30% of the new genes in the D. melanogaster species complex recruited various genomic sequences and formed chimeric gene structures, suggesting structure innovation as an important way to help fixation of new genes; and (6) the rate of the origin of new functional genes is estimated to be five to 11 genes per million years in the D. melanogaster subgroup. Finally, we survey gene frequencies among 19 globally derived strains for D. melanogaster-specific new genes and reveal that 44.4% of them show copy number polymorphisms within a population.

DNA damage induced by industrial solid waste leachates in Drosophila melanogaster: a mechanistic approach,18240159,10.1002/em.20373,"Genomic stability requires that error-free genetic information be transmitted from generation to generation, a process that is dependent upon efficient DNA repair. Industrial leachates which contain mixtures of diverse chemicals are a major environmental concern. The interaction between these chemicals may have synergistic, antagonistic, or simply additive effects on biological systems. In the present study, the Comet assay was used to measure the DNA damage produced by leachates of solid wastes from flashlight battery, pigment, and tanning factories in the midgut cells and brain ganglia of Drosophila melanogaster mutants deficient in DNA repair proteins. Larvae were allowed to feed for 48 or 72 hr on diets containing 0.1, 0.5, and 2.0% (v/v) of the leachates. Physicochemical analysis run on the solid wastes, leachates, and treated larvae detected elevated levels of heavy metals. Leachates produced significantly greater levels of DNA damage in mutant strains mei41 (deficient in cell cycle check point protein), mus201 (deficient in excision repair protein), mus308 (deficient in postreplication repair protein), and rad54 (deficient in double strand break repair protein) than in the OregonR(+) wild-type strain. Larvae of the ligaseIV mutant (deficient in double strand break repair protein) were hypersensitive only to the pigment plant waste leachate. Conversely, the dnase2 mutant (deficient in protein responsible for degrading fragmented DNA) was more sensitive to DNA damage induction from the flashlight battery and tannery waste leachates. Our data demonstrate that repair of DNA damage in organisms exposed to leachates is dependent upon several DNA repair proteins, indicative of the involvement of multiple overlapping repair pathways.

Mating frequency and inclusive fitness in Drosophila melanogaster,18171147,10.1086/523944,"In many species, increased mating frequency reduces maternal survival and reproduction. In order to understand the evolution of mating frequency, we need to determine the consequences of increased mating frequency for offspring. We conducted an experiment in Drosophila melanogaster in which we manipulated the mating frequency of mothers and examined the survival and fecundity of the mothers and their daughters. We found that mothers with the highest mating frequency had accelerated mortality and more rapid reproductive senescence. On average, they had 50% shorter lives and 30% lower lifetime reproductive success (LRS) than did mothers with the lowest mating frequency. However, mothers with the highest mating frequency produced daughters with 28% greater LRS. This finding implies that frequent mating stimulates cross-generational fitness trade-offs such that maternal fitness is reduced while offspring fitness is enhanced. We evaluate these results using a demographic metric of inclusive fitness. We show that the costs and benefits of mating frequency depend on the growth rate of the population. In an inclusive fitness context, there was no evidence that increased mating frequency results in fitness costs for mothers. These results indicate that cross-generational fitness trade-offs have an important role in sexual selection and life-history evolution.",2008,"Nicholas K Priest, Laura F Galloway, Deborah A Roach, Nicholas K Priest, Laura F Galloway, Deborah A Roach"

Cold-induced alteration in the global structure of the male sex chromosome of In1BM2(reinverted) of Drosophila melanogaster is associated with increased acetylation of histone 4 at lysine 16,19147908,10.1007/s12041-008-0037-z,"In Drosophila melanogaster, dosage compensation occurs through hypertranscription of sex-linked genes in males. The hypertranscription involves acetylation of histone 4 at lysine 16 (H4K16) on amale X-chromosome, brought about by a histone acetyltransferase encoded by the dosage compensation gene, males absent on the first (mof). We report a phenomenon in the strain In(1)B(M2)(reinverted) of D. melanogaster where the global structure of the male X-chromosome can be altered at the third instar larval stage through a 4-h cold shock at 12+/-1 degrees C. We show that the cold shock results in a transient hyperacetylation of H4K16 and an increased expression of MOF. Control proteins H4 acetylated at lysine 5, and the dosage compensation gene msl-2, do not show any change in expression after cold shock. Cytology of the male X-chromosome at different time points during cold shock and recovery, suggests that the hyperacetylation of H4 at lysine 16 causes the X-chromosome to corkscrew into itself, thereby achieving the cold-induced change in the higher order structure of the male polytene X-chromosome. Our studies suggest a role for H4K16 in maintaining the structure of the male X-chromosome in Drosophila.",2008,"S Kulkarni-Shukla, A P Barge, R S Vartak, Anita Kar, S Kulkarni-Shukla, A P Barge, R S Vartak, Anita Kar"

To address this question, we systematically assessed Notch localization, processing, and signaling in a comprehensive set of Drosophila melanogaster mutants that block access of cargo to different endocytic compartments. We find that gamma-secretase cleavage and signaling of endogenous Notch is reduced in mutants that impair entry into the early endosome but is enhanced in mutants that increase endosomal retention. In mutants that block endosomal entry, we also uncover an alternative, low-efficiency Notch trafficking route that can contribute to signaling. Our data show that endosomal access of the Notch receptor is critical to achieve physiological levels of signaling and further suggest that altered residence in distinct endocytic compartments could underlie pathologies involving aberrant Notch pathway activation.",2008,"Thomas Vaccari, Han Lu, Ritu Kanwar, Mark E Fortini, David Bilder, Thomas Vaccari, Han Lu, Ritu Kanwar, Mark E Fortini, David Bilder"
Drosophila melanogaster mounts a unique immune response to the Rhabdovirus sigma virus,18378641,10.1128/AEM.02248-07,"Rhabdoviruses are important pathogens of humans, livestock, and plants that are often vectored by insects.

The infection is maintained in Drosophila populations through vertical transmission via germ cells. We report here the nature of the Drosophila innate immune response to SIGMAV infection as revealed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis of differentially expressed genes identified by microarray analysis. We have also compared and contrasted the immune response of the host with respect to two nonenveloped viruses, Drosophila C virus (DCV) and Drosophila X virus (DXV).

A peripheral pacemaker drives the circadian rhythm of synaptic boutons in Drosophila independently of synaptic activity,18688648,10.1007/s00441-008-0670-0,"Circadian rhythms in the morphology of neurons have been demonstrated in the fly Drosophila melanogaster. One such rhythm is characterized by changes in the size of synaptic boutons of an identified flight motor neuron, with larger boutons during the day compared with those at night. A more detailed temporal resolution of this rhythm shows here that boutons grow at a time of increased locomotor activity during the morning but become gradually smaller during the day and second period of increased locomotor activity in the evening. We have experimentally manipulated the synaptic activity of the fly during short periods of the day to investigate whether changes in bouton size might be a consequence of the different levels of synaptic activity associated with the locomotion rhythm of the fly. In the late night and early morning, when the flies normally have an intense period of locomotion, the boutons grow independently of whether the flies are active or completely paralyzed. Bouton size is not affected by sleep-deprivation during the early night. The cycle in bouton size persists for 2 days even in decapitated flies, which do not move, reinforcing the notion that it is largely independent of synaptic activity, and showing that a pacemaker other than the main biological clock can drive it.",2008,"Kerstin I Mehnert, Rafael Cantera, Kerstin I Mehnert, Rafael Cantera"
Sex combs are important for male mating success in Drosophila melanogaster,18213513,10.1007/s10519-008-9190-7,"The sex comb is one of the most rapidly evolving male-specific traits in Drosophila, making it an attractive model to study sexual selection and developmental evolution. Drosophila males use their sex combs to grasp the females' abdomen and genitalia and to spread their wings prior to copulation. To test the role of this structure in male mating success in Drosophila melanogaster, we genetically ablated the sex comb by expressing the female-specific isoform of the sex determination gene transformer in the tarsal segments of male legs. This technique does not remove the sex comb entirely, but simply restores the morphology of its constituent bristles to the ancestral condition found in Drosophila species that lack sex combs. Direct observations and differences in long-term insemination rates show that the loss of the sex comb strongly reduces the ability of males to copulate with females. Detailed analysis of video recordings indicates that this effect is not due to changes in the males' courtship behavior. Rapid evolution of sex comb morphology may be driven either by changes in female preferences, or by co-evolution between sex combs and female external genitalia.",2008,"Chen Siang Ng, Artyom Kopp, Chen Siang Ng, Artyom Kopp"

      With the worldwide use of insecticides, an increasing number of pest insect species have evolved target-site or metabolism-based resistance towards some of these compounds. The resulting decreased efficacy of pesticides threatens human welfare by its impact on crop safety and further disease transmission. Environmental concentrations of some insecticides are so high that even natural populations of non-target, non-pest organisms such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster Meig. have been selected for resistance. Cyp6g1-overexpressing strains of D. melanogaster are resistant to a wide range of chemically diverse insecticides, including DDT and imidacloprid. However, up to now there has been no evidence that the CYP6G1 enzyme metabolises any of these compounds.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here it is shown, by heterologous expression in cell suspension cultures of Nicotiana tabacum L. (tobacco), that CYP6G1 is capable of converting DDT (20 microg per cell culture assay) by dechlorination to DDD (18% of applied amount in 48 h), and imidacloprid (400 microg) mainly by hydroxylation to 4-hydroxyimidacloprid and 5-hydroxyimidacloprid (58 and 19% respectively in 48 h).
    

    
  


        Conclusion:

In light of these results, we suggest that CO2 should not be used after hardening in heat resistance assays due to the complete reversal of the heat hardening process upon exposure to CO2.",2008,"Claire C Milton, Linda Partridge, Claire C Milton, Linda Partridge"
Adenylyl cyclase encoded by AC78C participates in sugar perception in Drosophila melanogaster,19046378,10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06507.x,"In gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) in Drosophila melanogaster, Gr5a and one of the Gr64s encode sugar receptors with seven transmembrane domains. Previously, we have shown that the responses to various sugars are depressed in DGsalpha mutant flies (Ueno et al., 2006). Because DGsalpha is a homolog of Gs, we hypothesized that the sugar receptors are coupled to adenylyl cyclase (AC) in Drosophila. The aim of this study was to identify the AC that participates in sugar perception. Here, we found that an AC inhibitor, MDL-12330A, depressed the response in GRNs to trehalose as well as sucrose; that an AC gene, AC78C, was expressed in the sugar-sensitive GRNs; that RNAi against AC78C depressed the electrical response in GRNs to sucrose; and that the sugar response in GRNs, as well as sugar intake in a behavioral assay in an AC78C mutant, was depressed at low sugar concentrations. We conclude that AC78C, via cAMP, participates in the sugar-taste signaling pathway at the low concentration range.",2008,"Kohei Ueno, Yoshiaki Kidokoro, Kohei Ueno, Yoshiaki Kidokoro"
unpaired (upd)-3 expression and other immune-related functions are stimulated by interleukin-8 in Drosophila melanogaster SL2 cell line,18926718,10.1016/j.cyto.2008.08.011,"Invertebrate innate immunity relies on both cellular and humoral components. Among humoral factors, there is less information on soluble molecules able to act as signals during the immune response (i.e. cytokines). In Drosophila melanogaster, the cytokine Unpaired (Upd)-3, is known to activate the JAK/STAT pathway, but it is still not clear which molecules and pathways are responsible for its induction and secretion. It has been proposed that highly chemotactic factors may increase the expression of upd-3. In this respect, we have studied the effects of the chemotactic human recombinant (hr) interleukin (IL)-8 on the immune functions of Drosophila SL2 macrophage-like cells. The hrIL-8 increases the percentage of phagocytic cells with a specific timing and enhances the expression of the cytokine, upd-3, as well as that of the putative cytokine Drosophila helical factor (dhf). The antimicrobial peptides defensin, cecropin A1 and diptericin, are all influenced in their expression by the human chemokine, while hrIL-8 leaves unaffected the expression of drosomycin, i.e. the antimicrobial peptide more strictly connected with the Toll pathway. Similar effects to those registered for hrIL-8 are also provoked by a specific activator of the Imd pathway, i.e. the Escherichia coli peptidoglycan. RNAi experiments demonstrated that the silencing of the Imd pathway-associated kinase dTAK1, leaves unaffected the induction of upd-3, while it completely abolishes the effects of hrIL-8-on the expression of dhf. Our data suggest that the Imd pathway is not fundamental in regulating the levels of upd-3, whereas it controls the expression of the putative cytokine dhf.",2008,"Davide Malagoli, Sandro Sacchi, Enzo Ottaviani, Davide Malagoli, Sandro Sacchi, Enzo Ottaviani"
Proteomics reveals novel Drosophila seminal fluid proteins transferred at mating,18666829,10.1371/journal.pbio.0060178,"Across diverse taxa, seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) transferred at mating affect the reproductive success of both sexes. Such reproductive proteins often evolve under positive selection between species; because of this rapid divergence, Sfps are hypothesized to play a role in speciation by contributing to reproductive isolation between populations. In Drosophila, individual Sfps have been characterized and are known to alter male sperm competitive ability and female post-mating behavior, but a proteomic-scale view of the transferred Sfps has been missing. Here we describe a novel proteomic method that uses whole-organism isotopic labeling to detect transferred Sfps in mated female D. melanogaster. We identified 63 proteins, which were previously unknown to function in reproduction, and confirmed the transfer of dozens of predicted Sfps. Relative quantification of protein abundance revealed that several of these novel Sfps are abundant in seminal fluid. Positive selection and tandem gene duplication are the prevailing forces of Sfp evolution, and comparative proteomics with additional species revealed lineage-specific changes in seminal fluid content. We also report a proteomic-based gene discovery method that uncovered 19 previously unannotated genes in D. melanogaster. Our results demonstrate an experimental method to identify transferred proteins in any system that is amenable to isotopic labeling, and they underscore the power of combining proteomic and evolutionary analyses to shed light on the complex process of Drosophila reproduction.",2008,"Geoffrey D Findlay, Xianhua Yi, Michael J Maccoss, Willie J Swanson, Geoffrey D Findlay, Xianhua Yi, Michael J Maccoss, Willie J Swanson"
The expression of heat shock protein HSP60A reveals a dynamic mitochondrial pattern in Drosophila melanogaster embryos,18549261,10.1021/pr800006x,"The evolutionarily conserved hsp60 ( heat-shock protein 60) family of molecular chaperones ensures the correct folding of nuclear-encoded proteins after their translocation across the mitochondrial membrane during development as well as after heat-shock treatment. Although the overexpression of HSP60 proteins and their localization in the cytoplasm have been linked with many humans pathologies, the detailed pattern of their expression in different animal models and their subcellular localization during normal development and in stress conditions are little-known. In this report, we have used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by MALDI-TOF to identify and purify heat shock protein HSP60A of Drosophila melanoagaster. We demonstrate that it is heat-shock inducible and describe two novel antisera, specifically designed to recognize the denatured and native polypeptide, respectively, in Drosophila. Immunoelectron microscopy and immunostaining of Drosophila cells with these antibodies reveals that HSP60A is always localized to the inner membrane of mitochondria. Expression of HSP60A is post-transcriptionally regulated in a highly dynamic pattern during embryogenesis, even under heat-shock conditions. In contrast, in very stressful situations, its expression is upregulated transcriptionally over the entire embryo. These findings suggest novel roles for HSP60 family proteins during normal Drosophila development.",2008,"Luis Alberto Baena-LÃ³pez, Jana Alonso, Javier Rodriguez, Juan F SantarÃ©n, Luis Alberto Baena-LÃ³pez, Jana Alonso, Javier Rodriguez, Juan F SantarÃ©n"
Insect odorant receptors are molecular targets of the insect repellent DEET,18339904,10.1126/science.1153121,"DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) is the world's most widely used topical insect repellent, with broad effectiveness against most insects. Its mechanism of action and molecular target remain unknown. Here, we show that DEET blocks electrophysiological responses of olfactory sensory neurons to attractive odors in Anopheles gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster. DEET inhibits behavioral attraction to food odors in Drosophila, and this inhibition requires the highly conserved olfactory co-receptor OR83b. DEET inhibits odor-evoked currents mediated by the insect odorant receptor complex, comprising a ligand-binding subunit and OR83b. We conclude that DEET masks host odor by inhibiting subsets of heteromeric insect odorant receptors that require the OR83b co-receptor. The identification of candidate molecular targets for the action of DEET may aid in the design of safer and more effective insect repellents.",2008,"Mathias Ditzen, Maurizio Pellegrino, Leslie B Vosshall, Mathias Ditzen, Maurizio Pellegrino, Leslie B Vosshall"
Drosophila melanogaster prefers compounds perceived sweet by humans,18234713,10.1093/chemse/bjm088,"To understand the functional similarities of fly and mammalian taste receptors, we used a top-down approach that first established the fly sweetener-response profile. We employed the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, an omnivorous human commensal, and determined its sensitivity to an extended set of stimuli that humans find sweet. Flies were tested with all sweeteners in 2 assays that measured their taste reactivity (proboscis extension assay) and their ingestive preferences (free roaming ingestion choice test). A total of 21 sweeteners, comprised of 11 high-potency sweeteners, 2 amino acids, 5 sugars, 2 sugar alcohols, and a sweet salt (PbCl2), were tested in both assays. We found that wild-type Drosophila responded appetitively to most high-potency sweeteners preferred by humans, even those not considered sweet by rodents or new world monkeys. The similarities in taste preferences for sweeteners suggest that frugivorous/omnivorous apes and flies have evolved promiscuous carbohydrate taste detectors with similar affinities for myriad high-potency sweeteners. Whether these perceptual parallels are the result of convergent evolution of saccharide receptor-binding mechanisms remains to be determined.",2008,"Beth Gordesky-Gold, Natasha Rivers, Osama M Ahmed, Paul A S Breslin, Beth Gordesky-Gold, Natasha Rivers, Osama M Ahmed, Paul A S Breslin"
Establishment of cell fate during early Drosophila embryogenesis requires transcriptional Mediator subunit dMED31,18083158,10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.11.019,"During early Drosophila embryogenesis, formation of the anterior-posterior (A/P) axis depends on spatial gradients of maternal morphogens. It is well recognized that positional information is transmitted from these morphogens to the gap genes. However, how this information is being transmitted is largely unknown. The transcriptional Mediator complex is involved in the fine tuning of the signaling between chromatin status, transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. We found that a mutation in the conserved subunit of the Mediator complex, dMED31, hampers embryogenesis prior to gastrulation and leads to aberrant expression of the gap genes knirps and KrÃ¼ppel and the pair-rule genes fusi tarazu and even-skipped along the A/P axis. Expression of the maternal morphogens dorsal and hunchback was not affected in dMED31 mutants. mRNA expression of dMED31 exactly peaks between the highest expression levels of the maternal genes and the gap genes. Together, our results point to a role for dMED31 in guiding maternal morphogen directed zygotic gap gene expression and provide the first in vivo evidence for a role of the Mediator complex in the establishment of cell fate during the cellular blastoderm stage of Drosophila melanogaster.",2008,"Floris Bosveld, Sjoerd van Hoek, Ody C M Sibon, Floris Bosveld, Sjoerd van Hoek, Ody C M Sibon"
Contrasting patterns of sequence evolution at the functionally redundant bric ? brac paralogs in Drosophila melanogaster,19639236,10.1007/s00239-009-9265-y,"Genes with overlapping expression and function may gradually diverge despite retaining some common functions. To test whether such genes show distinct patterns of molecular evolution within species, we examined sequence variation at the bric ? brac (bab) locus of Drosophila melanogaster. This locus is composed of two anciently duplicated paralogs, bab1 and bab2, which are involved in patterning the adult abdomen, legs, and ovaries. We have sequenced the 148 kb genomic region spanning the bab1 and bab2 genes from 94 inbred lines of D. melanogaster sampled from a single location. Two non-coding regions, one in each paralog, appear to be under selection. The strongest evidence of directional selection is found in a region of bab2 that has no known functional role. The other region is located in the bab1 paralog and is known to contain a cis-regulatory element that controls sex-specific abdominal pigmentation. The coding region of bab1 appears to be under stronger functional constraint than the bab2 coding sequences. Thus, the two paralogs are evolving under different selective regimes in the same natural population, illuminating the different evolutionary trajectories of partially redundant duplicate genes.",2009,"Ryan D Bickel, Wendy S Schackwitz, Len A Pennacchio, Sergey V Nuzhdin, Artyom Kopp, Ryan D Bickel, Wendy S Schackwitz, Len A Pennacchio, Sergey V Nuzhdin, Artyom Kopp"
A complex suite of forces drives gene traffic from Drosophila X chromosomes,20333188,10.1093/gbe/evp018,"Theoretical studies predict X chromosomes and autosomes should be under different selection pressures, and there should therefore be differences in sex-specific and sexually antagonistic gene content between the X and the autosomes. Previous analyses have identified an excess of genes duplicated by retrotransposition from the X chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster. A number of hypotheses may explain this pattern, including mutational bias, escape from X-inactivation during spermatogenesis, and the movement of male-favored (sexually antagonistic) genes from a chromosome that is predominantly carried by females. To distinguish among these processes and to examine the generality of these patterns, we identified duplicated genes in nine sequenced Drosophila genomes. We find that, as in D. melanogaster, there is an excess of genes duplicated from the X chromosome across the genus Drosophila. This excess duplication is due almost completely to genes duplicated by retrotransposition, with little to no excess from the X among genes duplicated via DNA intermediates. The only exception to this pattern appears within the burst of duplication that followed the creation of the Drosophila pseudoobscura neo-X chromosome. Additionally, we examined genes relocated among chromosomal arms (i.e., genes duplicated to new locations coupled with the loss of the copy in the ancestral locus) and found an excess of genes relocated off the ancestral X and neo-X chromosomes. Interestingly, many of the same genes were duplicated or relocated from the independently derived neo-X chromosomes of D. pseudoobscura and Drosophila willistoni, suggesting that natural selection favors the traffic of genes from X chromosomes. Overall, we find that the forces driving gene duplication from X chromosomes are dependent on the lineage in question, the molecular mechanism of duplication considered, the preservation of the ancestral copy, and the age of the X chromosome.",2009,"Richard P Meisel, Mira V Han, Matthew W Hahn, Richard P Meisel, Mira V Han, Matthew W Hahn"
Nora virus persistent infections are not affected by the RNAi machinery,19478998,10.1371/journal.pone.0005731,"Drosophila melanogaster is widely used to decipher the innate immune system in response to various pathogens. The innate immune response towards persistent virus infections is among the least studied in this model system. We recently discovered a picorna-like virus, the Nora virus which gives rise to persistent and essentially symptom-free infections in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we have used this virus to study the interaction with its host and with some of the known Drosophila antiviral immune pathways. First, we find a striking variability in the course of the infection, even between flies of the same inbred stock. Some flies are able to clear the Nora virus but not others. This phenomenon seems to be threshold-dependent; flies with a high-titer infection establish stable persistent infections, whereas flies with a lower level of infection are able to clear the virus. Surprisingly, we find that both the clearance of low-level Nora virus infections and the stability of persistent infections are unaffected by mutations in the RNAi pathways. Nora virus infections are also unaffected by mutations in the Toll and Jak-Stat pathways. In these respects, the Nora virus differs from other studied Drosophila RNA viruses.",2009,"Mazen S Habayeb, Jens-Ola EkstrÃ¶m, Dan Hultmark, Mazen S Habayeb, Jens-Ola EkstrÃ¶m, Dan Hultmark"
Interactions between environmental stress and male mating success may enhance evolutionary divergence of stress-resistant Drosophila populations,19187243,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00648.x,"Adaptation of natural and laboratory-selected populations of Drosophila to desiccation stress results in enhanced water conservation abilities, and thus increased stress resistance. In this study, we tested whether laboratory selection for desiccation resistance is also reflected in increased mating success of adapted D. melanogaster males under desiccating conditions. Adapted flies perform better under stressful conditions, and as expected males from desiccation-selected populations exhibited significantly higher relative mating success in comparison with controls after 5-6 h of desiccation. However, we show evidence for a trade-off between survival under stressful conditions and mating success in nonstressful and even mildly stressful environments (2.5-3 h of desiccation), where males from selected populations were involved in only approximately 40% of observed copulations. This suggests that mutations favored by natural selection, associated with survival when resources are limited, may only be favored by sexual selection above a minimal ""threshold"" stress level. At milder stress levels increased resistance comes at a cost of lower relative mating success, and thus reduced fitness. This interaction between stress and relative male mating success of adapted and nonadapted males could interrupt gene flow, thus facilitating divergence of resistant populations from the ancestral population.",2009,"Eran Gefen, Allen G Gibbs, Eran Gefen, Allen G Gibbs"
Preferential ethanol consumption in Drosophila models features of addiction,20005106,10.1016/j.cub.2009.10.070,"Alcohol addiction is a common affliction with a strong genetic component [1]. Although mammalian studies have provided significant insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying ethanol consumption [2], other organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster are better suited for unbiased, forward genetic approaches to identify novel genes. Behavioral responses to ethanol, such as hyperactivity, sedation, and tolerance, are conserved between flies and mammals [3, 4], as are the underlying molecular pathways [5-9]. However, few studies have investigated ethanol self-administration in flies [10]. Here we characterize ethanol consumption and preference in Drosophila. Flies prefer to consume ethanol-containing food over regular food, and this preference increases over time. Flies are attracted to the smell of ethanol, which partially mediates ethanol preference, but are averse to its taste. Preference for consuming ethanol is not entirely explained by attraction to either its sensory or caloric properties. We demonstrate that flies can exhibit features of alcohol addiction. First, flies self-administer ethanol to pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Second, flies will overcome an aversive stimulus in order to consume ethanol. Third, flies rapidly return to high levels of ethanol consumption after a period of imposed abstinence. Thus, ethanol preference in Drosophila provides a new model for studying aspects of addiction.",2009,"Anita V Devineni, Ulrike Heberlein, Anita V Devineni, Ulrike Heberlein"

Unexpectedly, we found DMRP to exhibit an extremely high turnover rate for the substrate transport as compared to its human orthologues. Furthermore, DMRP showed remarkably high basal ATPase activity (68-75 nmol Pi/mg membrane protein/min), which could be further stimulated by probenecid and the glutathione conjugate of N-ethylmaleimide.

There was a rapid, approximately linear reduction in fly metabolic rate at P(O(2))s between 3 and 0.5 kPa. The reduction in metabolic rate was especially pronounced at P(O(2)) levels <0.5 kPa, and at a P(O(2)) of 0.1 kPa fly metabolic rate was reduced approximately 10-fold relative to normoxic levels. The metabolic rate of flies exposed to anoxia and then returned to normoxia recovered to pre-anoxic levels within 30 min with no apparent payment of a hypoxia-induced oxygen debt. Flies tolerated exposure to hypoxia and/or anoxia for 40 min with nearly 100% survival. Fly mortality increased rapidly after 2 h of anoxia and >16 h exposure was uniformly lethal. Flies exposed to pure O(2) for 24 h showed no apparent alteration of metabolic rate, even though such O(2) tensions should damage respiratory enzymes critical to mitochondria function.

Synergic entrainment of Drosophila's circadian clock by light and temperature,19926805,10.1177/0748730409348551,"Daily light and temperature cycles are considered the most important zeitgebers for circadian clocks in many organisms. The influence of each single zeitgeber on the clock has been well studied, but little is known about any synergistic effects of both zeitgebers on the clock. In nature, light and temperature show characteristic daily oscillations with the temperature rising during the light phase and reaching its maximum in the late afternoon. Here, we studied behavioral and molecular rhythms in Drosophila melanogaster under simulated natural low light-dark (LD) and temperature (T) cycles that typically occur during the September equinox. Wild-type flies were either subjected to simulated LD or T cycles alone or to a combination of both. Behavioral rhythms and molecular rhythms in the different clock neurons were assessed under the 3 different conditions. Although behavioral rhythms entrained to all conditions, the rhythms were most robust under the combination of LD and T cycles. The clock neurons responded differently to LD and T cycles. Some were not entrained by T cycles alone; others were only slightly entrained by LD cycles alone. The amplitude of the molecular cycling was not different between LD alone and T cycles alone; but LD alone could set the pacemaker neurons to similar phases, whereas T cycles alone could not. The combination of the 2 zeitgebers entrained all clock neurons not only with similar phase but also enhanced the amplitude of Timeless cycling in the majority of cells.

The Tribolium spineless ortholog specifies both larval and adult antennal identity,19030877,10.1007/s00427-008-0261-9,"The morphology of insect antennae varies widely among species, but our understanding of antennal development comes almost solely from studies of one species-the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Moreover, this knowledge applies mostly to adult structures, since Drosophila lacks external larval appendages. In contrast to Drosophila, the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, has both larval and adult antennae, which are very different from one another in morphology. Thus, Tribolium provides an ideal system to compare modes of antennal development both within and between species. Here, we report that the Tribolium ortholog of spineless (Tc-ss) is required in both the larval and adult antennae. Knockdown of Tc-ss by RNAi during either larval or imaginal development causes transformation of the distal portion of the antennae to legs. Thus, the function of ss is conserved between Drosophila and Tribolium with respect to adult antennal specification and also between Tribolium larval and adult antennal development. The similarity of the Tc-ss RNAi phenotype to that of a classically described Tribolium mutation, antennapedia (ap) (of no relationship to the Drosophila Hox gene of the same name), led us to characterize the original ap mutation and two newly identified ap alleles. Our mapping and phenotypic data suggest that Tc-ss is the best candidate for the ap locus.

      A molecular process based genotype-to-phenotype map will ultimately enable us to predict how genetic variation among individuals results in phenotypic alterations. Building such a map is, however, far from straightforward. It requires understanding how molecular variation re-shapes developmental and metabolic networks, and how the functional state of these networks modifies phenotypes in genotype specific way. We focus on the latter problem by describing genetic variation in transcript levels of genes in the InR/TOR pathway among 72 Drosophila melanogaster genotypes.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We observe tight co-variance in transcript levels of genes not known to influence each other through direct transcriptional control. We summarize transcriptome variation with factor analyses, and observe strong co-variance of gene expression within the dFOXO-branch and within the TOR-branch of the pathway. Finally, we investigate whether major axes of transcriptome variation shape phenotypes expected to be influenced through the InR/TOR pathway. We find limited evidence that transcript levels of individual upstream genes in the InR/TOR pathway predict fly phenotypes in expected ways. However, there is no evidence that these effects are mediated through the major axes of downstream transcriptome variation.

Drosophila melanogaster males respond differently at the behavioural and genome-wide levels to Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans females,19765174,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01834.x,"Drosophila melanogaster are found in sympatry with Drosophila simulans, and matings between the species produce nonfertile hybrid offspring at low frequency. Evolutionary theory predicts that females choose mates, so males should alter their behaviour in response to female cues. We show that D. melanogaster males quickly decrease courtship towards D. simulans females. Courtship levels are reduced within 5 min of exposure to a heterospecific female, and overall courtship is significantly lower than courtship towards conspecific females. To understand changes at the molecular level during mate choice, we performed microarray analysis on D. melanogaster males that courted heterospecific D. simulans females and found nine genes have altered expression compared with controls. In contrast, males that court conspecific females alter expression of at least 35 loci.

A transcriptional network associated with natural variation in Drosophila aggressive behavior,19607677,10.1186/gb-2009-10-7-r76,"Background:
      
    

    
      Aggressive behavior is an important component of fitness in most animals. Aggressive behavior is genetically complex, with natural variation attributable to multiple segregating loci with allelic effects that are sensitive to the physical and social environment. However, we know little about the genes and genetic networks affecting natural variation in aggressive behavior. Populations of Drosophila melanogaster harbor quantitative genetic variation in aggressive behavior, providing an excellent model system for dissecting the genetic basis of naturally occurring variation in aggression.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Correlating variation in transcript abundance with variation in complex trait phenotypes is a rapid method for identifying candidate genes. We quantified aggressive behavior in 40 wild-derived inbred lines of D. melanogaster and performed a genome-wide association screen for quantitative trait transcripts and single feature polymorphisms affecting aggression. We identified 266 novel candidate genes associated with aggressive behavior, many of which have pleiotropic effects on metabolism, development, and/or other behavioral traits. We performed behavioral tests of mutations in 12 of these candidate genes, and show that nine indeed affected aggressive behavior. We used the genetic correlations among the quantitative trait transcripts to derive a transcriptional genetic network associated with natural variation in aggressive behavior. The network consists of nine modules of correlated transcripts that are enriched for genes affecting common functions, tissue-specific expression patterns, and/or DNA sequence motifs.

Splice-variant- and stage-specific RNA editing of the Drosophila GABA receptor modulates agonist potency,19339622,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5251-08.2009,"The molecular diversity of many gene products functioning in the nervous system is enhanced by alternative splicing and adenosine-to-inosine editing of pre-mRNA. Using RDL, a Drosophila melanogaster GABA-gated ion channel, we examined the functional impact of RNA editing at several sites along with alternative splicing of more than one exon. We show that alternative splicing and RNA editing have a combined influence on the potency of the neurotransmitter GABA, and the editing isoforms detected in vivo span the entire functional range of potencies seen for all possible edit variants expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The extent of RNA editing is developmentally regulated and can also be linked to the choice of alternative exons.

Here we provide a review of the genetics of longevity in D. melanogaster, in which we describe the characterization of individual aging genes, the complexity of the genetic architecture of this quantitative trait, and the evaluation of natural genetic variation in the evolution of life histories.",2009,"Annalise B Paaby, Paul S Schmidt"
"Live imaging reveals that the Drosophila actin-binding ERM protein, moesin, co-localizes with the mitotic spindle",19592131,10.1016/j.ejcb.2009.05.006,"Members of the vertebrate ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) protein family crosslink the actin cytoskeleton and the cell membrane and are, therefore, considered cytoplasmic regulators of cell adhesion, cell movement and membrane trafficking. Here we demonstrate that besides its cytoplasmic functions Drosophila moesin, the only ERM protein in Drosophila melanogaster, exhibits a dynamic cell cycle-dependent nuclear localization. In a small fraction of cells and at a low level, moesin can be detected in interphase nuclei in regions complementary to the chromatin; its level rapidly increases during prophase and it co-localizes with the actin network surrounding the mitotic spindles throughout mitosis. We also found that the predicted single nuclear localization signal in moesin is not necessary for the nuclear accumulation of the protein. FRAP experiments confirmed this finding and further revealed that the mitotic localization of moesin is highly dynamic. Immuno-histochemical staining for moesin demonstrated the existence of spindle association in wild-type embryos. The biological relevance of this phenomenon is indicated by the mitotic phenotypes detected in S2 cells treated with moesin RNAi, and awaits future exploration.",2009,"PÃ©ter Vilmos, Ferenc Jankovics, Margit SzathmÃ¡ri, TamÃ¡s LukÃ¡csovich, LÃ¡szlÃ³ Henn, MiklÃ³s ErdÃ©lyi, PÃ©ter Vilmos, Ferenc Jankovics, Margit SzathmÃ¡ri, TamÃ¡s LukÃ¡csovich, LÃ¡szlÃ³ Henn, MiklÃ³s ErdÃ©lyi"

Evolutionary conservation and changes in insect TRP channels,19740447,10.1186/1471-2148-9-228,"Background:
      
    

    
      TRP (Transient Receptor Potential) channels respond to diverse stimuli and thus function as the primary integrators of varied sensory information. They are also activated by various compounds and secondary messengers to mediate cell-cell interactions as well as to detect changes in the local environment. Their physiological roles have been primarily characterized only in mice and fruit flies, and evolutionary studies are limited. To understand the evolution of insect TRP channels and the mechanisms of integrating sensory inputs in insects, we have identified and compared TRP channel genes in Drosophila melanogaster, Bombyx mori, Tribolium castaneum, Apis mellifera, Nasonia vitripennis, and Pediculus humanus genomes as part of genome sequencing efforts.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      All the insects examined have 2 TRPV, 1 TRPN, 1 TRPM, 3 TRPC, and 1 TRPML subfamily members, demonstrating that these channels have the ancient origins in insects. The common pattern also suggests that the mechanisms for detecting mechanical and visual stimuli and maintaining lysosomal functions may be evolutionarily well conserved in insects. However, a TRPP channel, the most ancient TRP channel, is missing in B. mori, A. mellifera, and N. vitripennis. Although P. humanus and D. melanogaster contain 4 TRPA subfamily members, the other insects have 5 TRPA subfamily members. T. castaneum, A. mellifera, and N. vitripennis contain TRPA5 channels, which have been specifically retained or gained in Coleoptera and Hymenoptera. Furthermore, TRPA1, which functions for thermotaxis in Drosophila, is missing in A. mellifera and N. vitripennis; however, they have other Hymenoptera-specific TRPA channels (AmHsTRPA and NvHsTRPA). NvHsTRPA expressed in HEK293 cells is activated by temperature increase, demonstrating that HsTRPAs function as novel thermal sensors in Hymenoptera.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The total number of insect TRP family members is 13-14, approximately half that of mammalian TRP family members. As shown for mammalian TRP channels, this may suggest that single TRP channels are responsible for integrating diverse sensory inputs to maintain the insect sensory systems. The above results demonstrate that there are both evolutionary conservation and changes in insect TRP channels. In particular, the evolutionary processes have been accelerated in the TRPA subfamily, indicating divergence in the mechanisms that insects use to detect environmental temperatures.",2009,"Hironori Matsuura, Takaaki Sokabe, Keigo Kohno, Makoto Tominaga, Tatsuhiko Kadowaki, Hironori Matsuura, Takaaki Sokabe, Keigo Kohno, Makoto Tominaga, Tatsuhiko Kadowaki"
Evolutionary modeling and prediction of non-coding RNAs in Drosophila,19668382,10.1371/journal.pone.0006478,"We performed benchmarks of phylogenetic grammar-based ncRNA gene prediction, experimenting with eight different models of structural evolution and two different programs for genome alignment. We evaluated our models using alignments of twelve Drosophila genomes. We find that ncRNA prediction performance can vary greatly between different gene predictors and subfamilies of ncRNA gene. Our estimates for false positive rates are based on simulations which preserve local islands of conservation; using these simulations, we predict a higher rate of false positives than previous computational ncRNA screens have reported. Using one of the tested prediction grammars, we provide an updated set of ncRNA predictions for D. melanogaster and compare them to previously-published predictions and experimental data. Many of our predictions show correlations with protein-coding genes. We found significant depletion of intergenic predictions near the 3' end of coding regions and furthermore depletion of predictions in the first intron of protein-coding genes. Some of our predictions are colocated with larger putative unannotated genes: for example, 17 of our predictions showing homology to the RFAM family snoR28 appear in a tandem array on the X chromosome; the 4.5 Kbp spanned by the predicted tandem array is contained within a FlyBase-annotated cDNA.",2009,"Robert K Bradley, Andrew V Uzilov, Mitchell E Skinner, Yuri R BendaÃ±a, Lars Barquist, Ian Holmes, Robert K Bradley, Andrew V Uzilov, Mitchell E Skinner, Yuri R BendaÃ±a, Lars Barquist, Ian Holmes"

Minimal functional sequences and key residues were identified from Sun and SPAM by studying truncation and alanine-scanning mutations. These peptide agonists share little sequence homology and illustrate the promiscuity of Mth for activation. mth mutants exhibit no defects in behaviors controlled by SP, casting doubt on the biological significance of Mth activation by any of these agonists, and illustrating the difficulty in applying in vitro studies to their relevance in vivo.

The relationship of heart function to temperature in Drosophila melanogaster and its heritability,19637324,10.1002/jez.556,"We measured heart rate and rhythmicity (regularity) of heartbeat in Drosophila melanogaster at five different temperatures (20, 25, 30, 35, and 37 degrees C) for a Florida population and estimated the narrow-sense heritability of both traits. Heritability of heart rate ranged from 0.17 to 0.24, but was statistically significant only at 20 degrees (h(2)=0.24) and at 30 degrees (h(2)=0.23). The heritability of heartbeat rhythmicity ranged from -0.034 to 0.11, and was not significant at any temperature. Heart rate increased linearly with increasing temperature; the temperature-dependence of heart rate was itself heritable (h(2)=0.29). Heart rhythmicity varied curvilinearly and was well-represented by a parabolic function, peaking at about 27 degrees which suggests a temperature optimum. The regularity of the heartbeat did not covary with heart rate except at 20 degrees . Neither heart rate nor regularity covaried with the change in heart rate with temperature. For this population of D. melanogaster, we conclude that there is substantial genetic variation for the mechanism whereby the cardiac pacemaker reacts to changes in temperature, but not for the cardiac pacemaker's rhythmicity. The small values of h(2) for temperature-specific heart rate and heartbeat rhythmicity suggest that these traits have been subjected to natural selection.",2009,"Tricia Jennings, John Ringo, Harold Dowse, Tricia Jennings, John Ringo, Harold Dowse"

A sustained increase in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism caused by the reduced expression of DmDG accounted for the cryophilic phenotype of the atu mutant.

Genetic changes accompanying the evolution of host specialization in Drosophila sechellia,19033155,10.1534/genetics.108.093419,"Changes in host specialization contribute to the diversification of phytophagous insects. When shifting to a new host, insects evolve new physiological, morphological, and behavioral adaptations. Our understanding of the genetic changes responsible for these adaptations is limited. For instance, we do not know how often host shifts involve gain-of-function vs. loss-of-function alleles. Recent work suggests that some genes involved in odor recognition are lost in specialists. Here we show that genes involved in detoxification and metabolism, as well as those affecting olfaction, have reduced gene expression in Drosophila sechellia-a specialist on the fruit of Morinda citrifolia. We screened for genes that differ in expression between D. sechellia and its generalist sister species, D. simulans. We also screened for genes that are differentially expressed in D. sechellia when these flies chose their preferred host vs. when they were forced onto other food. D. sechellia increases expression of genes involved with oogenesis and fatty acid metabolism when on its host. The majority of differentially expressed genes, however, appear downregulated in D. sechellia. For several functionally related genes, this decrease in expression is associated with apparent loss-of-function alleles. For example, the D. sechellia allele of Odorant binding protein 56e (Obp56e) harbors a premature stop codon. We show that knockdown of Obp56e activity significantly reduces the avoidance response of D. melanogaster toward M. citrifolia. We argue that apparent loss-of-function alleles like Obp56e potentially contributed to the initial adaptation of D. sechellia to its host. Our results suggest that a subset of genes reduce or lose function as a consequence of host specialization, which may explain why, in general, specialist insects tend to shift to chemically similar hosts.",2009,"Ian Dworkin, Corbin D Jones, Ian Dworkin, Corbin D Jones"

Analysis of the genes composing the cluster indicates that their transcription in Drosophila melanogaster is a stage-specific process. Comparison of the expression of these genes in the strains OreR, SS, and MS having the flamenco phenotype and in the strain 413 having the flamenco+ phenotype revealed differences only for the DIP1 gene, transcription of this gene being altered only in the OreR strain.

Additional deletion leading to the appearance of the stop-codon TGA was found in exon 1 in populations inhabiting opposite slopes at Nahal Oren canyon. Mating experiments between carriers of various desat2 alleles estimated the putative effect of desat2 status on courtship behaviour. The allele with an additional deletion in exon 1 seems to play some role in mating success, which is associated with shorter courtship latency and courtship duration.

Loss of RecQ5 leads to spontaneous mitotic defects and chromosomal aberrations in Drosophila melanogaster,19013260,10.1016/j.dnarep.2008.10.007,"RecQ5 belongs to the RecQ DNA helicase family that includes genes causative of Bloom, Werner, and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes. Although no human disease has been genetically linked to a mutation in RecQ5, Drosophila melanogaster RecQ5 is highly expressed in early embryos, suggesting an important role for it in the DNA metabolism of the early embryo. In this present study, we generated RecQ5 mutants in D. melanogaster. Embryos lacking maternally derived RecQ5 contained irregular nuclei in early embryogenesis. These irregular nuclei emerged in nuclear cycle 11-13, lost cell-cycle markers, and were located below the surface monolayer of nuclei. By time-lapse microscopy, these irregular nuclei were observed not to divide, whereas all neighboring nuclei proceeded through normal mitotic division with synchrony. These data suggest that the irregular nuclei exited from the nuclear division cycle. This phenotype is reminiscent of the effect of X-ray irradiation on wild-type embryos and was rescued by expression of RecQ5. Thus, the maternal supply of RecQ5 is important for the nuclear cycles in syncytical embryos. Furthermore, the frequencies of spontaneous and induced chromosomal aberrations were increased in RecQ5 mutant neuroblasts. These data imply that DNA damage accumulates spontaneously in RecQ5 mutants. Therefore, endogenous genomic damage may be produced in Drosophila development, and RecQ5 would be involved in the maintenance of genomic stability by suppressing the accumulation of DNA damage.",2009,"Minoru Nakayama, Shin-Ichiroh Yamaguchi, Yoshiko Sagisu, Haruna Sakurai, Fumiaki Ito, Katsumi Kawasaki, Minoru Nakayama, Shin-Ichiroh Yamaguchi, Yoshiko Sagisu, Haruna Sakurai, Fumiaki Ito, Katsumi Kawasaki"

The time-lapse analysis was augmented by a high-resolution analysis of fixed embryos where it was possible to unambiguously trace the three-dimensional paths of individual chromosomes. In prophase, the centromeres were found to be clustered at the top of the nucleus while the telomeres were situated at the bottom of the nucleus or towards the embryo interior. This polarized centromere-telomere orientation, perpendicular to the embryo surface, was preserved during the process of prometaphase chromosome congression.

Restriction enzyme analysis was used to screen 1666 wild third chromosomes for Mtn duplications and a subset (327) of these lines for Mto duplications.

Postmetamorphic cell death in the nervous and muscular systems of Drosophila melanogaster,2106014,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.10-02-00403.1990,"Programmed cell death occurs in the nervous and muscular system of newly emerged adult Drosophila melanogaster. Many of the abdominal muscles that were used for eclosion and wing-spreading behavior degenerate by 12 hr after eclosion. Related neurons in the ventral ganglion also die within the first 24 hr. Ligation experiments showed that the muscle breakdown is triggered by a signal from the anterior region, presumably the head, that occurs about 1 hr before adult emergence. The timing of this signal suggests that eclosion hormone may be involved. Although muscle death is triggered prior to ecdysis, it can be delayed, at least temporarily, by forcing the emerging flies to show a prolonged ecdysis behavior. In contrast to the muscles, the death of the neurons is triggered after emergence. The signal for neuronal degeneration is closely correlated with the initiation of wing inflation behavior. Ligation and digging experiments and behavioral manipulations that either blocked or delayed wing expansion behavior had a parallel effect in suppressing or delaying neuronal death.",1990,"K I Kimura, J W Truman, K I Kimura, J W Truman"
The fatty acid constitution and ordering state of membranes in dominant temperature-sensitive lethal mutation and wild-type Drosophila melanogaster larvae,2168167,10.1007/BF02401414,"The ordering state and changes in fatty acid composition of microsomal (MS) and mitochondrial (MC) membranes of two dominant temperature-sensitive (DTS) lethal mutations and the wild-type Oregon-R strain larvae of Drosophila melanogaster have been studied at 18 and 29 degrees C and after temperature-shift experiments. The membranes of wild-type larvae have a stable ordering state, with ""S"" values between 0.6 (18 degrees C) and 0.5 (29 degrees C) in both membranes which remained unchanged in shift experiments, although the ratios of saturated/unsaturated fatty acids were changed as expected. The strongly DTS mutation 1(2) 10DTS forms very rigid membranes at the restrictive temperature (29 degrees C) which cannot be normalized after shift down, while shift up or development at the permissive temperature results in normal ordering state. This mutant is less able to adjust MS and MC fatty acid composition in response to the growth temperature than the wild type. The less temperature-sensitive 1(2)2DTS allele occupies an intermediate state between Oregon-R and 1(2)10DTS in both respects. We assume and the genetical data suggest that the DTS mutant gene product is in competition with the wild-type product, resulting in a membrane structure which is not able to accommodate to the restrictive temperature.",1990,"J Szidonya, T Farkas, T Pali, J Szidonya, T Farkas, T Pali"

Analysis of competitive interactions in triocultures of Drosophila melanogaster,2111299,10.1038/hdy.1990.26,"Competitive interactions in complex mixtures of genotypes have rarely been studied despite their obvious importance in both natural and commercial populations. Here, we describe a procedure for the analysis of competition in tripartite mixtures of Drosophila melanogaster genotypes. We have utilised a substitution design coupled with a yield-density regression analysis which describes intra- and inter-genotypic competitive effects in terms of simple linear parameters. The experimental design allows any of the competitors to be considered as the primary or indicator genotype and also incorporates variation in the relative proportions of the two associate competitors. The regression parameters are used to derive estimates of the competitive pressure exerted by each associate on the indicator genotype and also the response or sensitivity of the indicator to the competitive pressure which it faces in mixed culture. The results indicate that the joint pressure exerted by the paired associate genotypes in trioculture is equal to the sum of the individual pressures of those associates. This additive relationship holds for a variety of indicator genotypes isolated from the Texas population and appears to be a general property of Drosophila competition. We identified one indicator genotype which consistently departed from this relationship although additivity of joint pressures could be restored in combination with particular associate genotypes. The possible role of larval interference in the determination of these interactions is discussed.",1990,"M Hemmat, P Eggleston, M Hemmat, P Eggleston"
Drosophila melanogaster troponin-T mutations engender three distinct syndromes of myofibrillar abnormalities,2124273,10.1016/0022-2836(90)90390-8,"In vertebrates troponin complexes interact co-operatively with tropomyosin dimers to modulate skeletal muscle contraction. In order further to investigate troponin assembly and function in vivo, we are developing molecular genetic approaches. Here we report characterization of the gene that encodes Drosophila tropinin-T and analyses of muscle defects engendered by several mutant alleles. We found that the Drosophila troponin-T locus specifies at least three proteins having sequences similar to vertebrate troponin-T. All are significantly larger than any avian or mammalian isoforms, however, due to a highly acidic carboxy-terminal extension. Comparisons of the chromosomal arrangements of vertebrate and Drosophila troponin-T genes revealed that the location of one intron-exon boundary is conserved. This observation and the similarity of vertebrate and Drosophila troponin-T primary sequences suggest that the respective proteins are homologous, and that troponin-T pre-dates the divergence of vertebrate and invertebrate organisms. In situ hybridization of the Drosophila troponin-T gene to polytene chromosomes demonstrated that it resides within subdivision 12A of the X chromosome, precisely where upheld and indented thorax flight muscle mutations have been mapped previously. We determined the nucleotide sequences of troponin-T genes in five extant mutants. All have deleterious alterations, directly establishing that upheld and indented thorax muscle abnormalities are due to defective troponin-T. Two of the alleles, upheld2 and upheld3, apparently disrupt RNA splicing and eliminate most or all troponin-T from flight and jump muscles, while the remaining three alleles change the identities of single amino acids of troponin-T. Electron microscopy of mutant muscles revealed that the two null alleles eliminate thin filaments, except where they are bound by electron-dense material presumed to be Z-disc proteins. Two of the point mutations, upheld101 and indented thorax3, do not perturb assembly of myofibrils, but cause their degeneration within days after muscles begin to be utilized. The final mutation, upheldwhu, reduces the diameter of the myofibril lattice by approximately one-half.

Preferential insertion of P elements into genes expressed in the germ-line of Drosophila melanogaster,2177140,10.1007/BF00633856,"A Drosophila transposable element, the P element, containing the bacterial gene encoding beta-galactosidase is widely used to search for tissue-specific enhancers. This lac-Z-containing P element (P-lacZ ry+) can be moved around the genome by a number of techniques. When it comes to lie close to a tissue-specific enhancer, blue staining results in particular tissues of the fly. Many different patterns of expression have already been obtained with the long-term aim of cloning the nearby genes that these enhancers normally regulate. Whilst analysing a set of flies containing these P-lacZ inserts for sex-specific expression in the adult, a preference was noticed for insertion into regions of DNA generating expression of beta-galactosidase in the male gonad. Since the transposition events generating these flies occurs in the male germ-line, it seemed possible that there was preferential insertion of the element into DNA which was being transcribed. To test this, transpositions were generated of the same P-lacZ ry+ in both the male and female germ-lines. The results are compatible with the above hypothesis. This finding has important implications for the type of enhancers likely to be found by this method, and may also be relevant to those using P elements as mutagens in Drosophila and for the study of the mechanism of P transposition.",1990,"M Bownes, M Bownes"

The pattern of transcription of the neurogenic gene Delta of Drosophila melanogaster,2128477,,"The function of the Delta locus of Drosophila melanogaster is required for the correct separation of neural and epidermal cell lineages. We describe here the transcriptional organization of this locus and the spatial pattern of mRNA accumulation during embryogenesis. Delta produces three mRNAs with protein-coding capacity, which differ only at their untranslated 3' ends and thus encode the same protein; other minor RNAs from the locus are shown not to have any protein-coding capacity and to correspond to introns. No indications were obtained for multiple translational products of the locus. In situ hybridization using digoxigenin-labelled probes confirms that Delta RNA is present at high concentration in all presumptive neurogenic territories of the embryo. Since all the constituent cells of these territories contain Delta RNA, a differential distribution of the protein among the derivatives of the neuroectodermal cells is improbable. Some time after segregation of lineages, Delta RNA reappears in neuroblasts. The possible significance of these observations with respect to the function of the Delta product during lineage segregation is discussed.",1990,"M Haenlin, B Kramatschek, J A Campos-Ortega, M Haenlin, B Kramatschek, J A Campos-Ortega"

The chromosomal locations of this stably inherited transgenic locus differed from strain to strain and demonstrated various expressivity on the whole-insect basis. Transcriptional induction of opd in one of these strains under control of the Drosophila heat shock promoter, hsp70, resulted in the synthesis of stable active enzyme that accumulated to high levels with repeated induction.

Natural variation of the amino-terminal glutamine-rich domain in Drosophila argonaute2 is not associated with developmental defects,21253006,10.1371/journal.pone.0015264,"The Drosophila argonaute2 (ago2) gene plays a major role in siRNA mediated RNA silencing pathways. Unlike mammalian Argonaute proteins, the Drosophila protein has an unusual amino-terminal domain made up largely of multiple copies of glutamine-rich repeats (GRRs). We report here that the ago2 locus produces an alternative transcript that encodes a putative short isoform without this amino-terminal domain. Several ago2 mutations previously reported to be null alleles only abolish expression of the long, GRR-containing isoform. Analysis of drop out (dop) mutations had previously suggested that variations in GRR copy number result in defects in RNAi and embryonic development. However, we find that dop mutations genetically complement transcript-null alleles of ago2 and that ago2 alleles with variant GRR copy numbers support normal development. In addition, we show that the assembly of the central RNAi machinery, the RISC (RNA induced silencing complex), is unimpaired in embryos when GRR copy number is altered. In fact, we find that GRR copy number is highly variable in natural D. melanogaster populations as well as in laboratory strains. Finally, while many other insects share an extensive, glutamine-rich Ago2 amino-terminal domain, its primary sequence varies drastically between species.

Proteomic characterization of a temperature-sensitive conditional lethal in Drosophila melanogaster,19812620,10.1038/hdy.2009.132,"Genetic variation that is expressed only under specific environmental conditions can contribute to additional adverse effects of inbreeding if environmental conditions change. We present a proteomic characterization of a conditional lethal found in an inbred line of Drosophila melanogaster. The lethal effect is apparent as a large increase in early mortality at the restrictive temperature (29 degrees C) as opposed to normal survival at the permissive temperature (20 degrees C). The increased mortality in response to the restrictive temperature is probably caused by a single recessive major locus. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) region segregating variation affecting the lethal effect has been identified, allowing for a separation of primary/causal effects and secondary consequences in the proteome expression patterns observed. In this study, the proteomic response to the restrictive temperature in the lethal-line (L-line) was compared with the response in an inbred-control-line (IC-line) and an outbred-control-line (OC-line). Quantitative protein changes were detected using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In all, 45 proteins were found to be significantly differently regulated in response to the restrictive temperature in the L-line as compared with the IC-line. No proteins were significantly differently regulated between the IC-line and the OC-line, verifying that differential protein regulation was specific to a genetic defect in the L-line. Proteins associated with oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondria were significantly overrepresented within the list of differentially expressed proteins. Proteins related to muscle contraction were also found to be differentially expressed in the L-line in response to the restrictive temperature, supporting phenotypic observations of moribund muscle hyper-contraction.",2010,"K S Pedersen, M C Codrea, C J Vermeulen, V Loeschcke, E Bendixen, K S Pedersen, M C Codrea, C J Vermeulen, V Loeschcke, E Bendixen"

The mechanisms that determine complete versus incomplete cytokinesis are not known. Here we report a novel in vivo role of the Drosophila CD2AP/CIN85 ortholog Cindr in both complete and incomplete cytokinesis. We also show evidence for the presence of persistent intercellular bridges in the major larval imaginal disc epithelia. During conventional division of both cultured and embryonic cells, Cindr localizes to cleavage furrows, intercellular bridges, and midbodies. Moreover, in cells undergoing incomplete cytokinesis in the female germline and the somatic ovarian follicle cell and larval imaginal disc epithelia, Cindr localizes to arrested cleavage furrows and stable intercellular bridges, respectively. In these structures, Cindr colocalizes with the essential cytokinesis regulator Anillin. We show that Cindr interacts with Anillin and that depletion of either Cindr or Anillin gives rise to binucleate cells and fewer intercellular bridges in vivo.

Further Cr (10 mM) markedly offset rotenone induced mitochondrial oxidative stress, completely restored the GSH levels, nitric oxide levels, activity of Mn-SOD and dopamine depletion.

Here, we examine thermotactic behavior of the Drosophila melanogaster larva using a tracking microscope to study individual larval movements on defined temperature gradients. We discover that larval thermotaxis involves a larger repertoire of strategies than navigation in smaller organisms such as motile bacteria and Caenorhabditis elegans. Beyond regulating run length (i.e., biasing a random walk), the Drosophila melanogaster larva also regulates the size and direction of turns to achieve and maintain favorable orientations. Thus, the sharp turns in a larva's trajectory represent decision points for selecting new directions of forward movement. The larva uses the same strategies to move up temperature gradients during positive thermotaxis and to move down temperature gradients during negative thermotaxis. Disrupting positive thermotaxis by inactivating cold-sensitive neurons in the larva's terminal organ weakens all regulation of turning decisions, suggesting that information from one set of temperature sensors is used to regulate all aspects of turning decisions. The Drosophila melanogaster larva performs thermotaxis by biasing stochastic turning decisions on the basis of temporal variations in thermosensory input, thereby augmenting the likelihood of heading toward favorable temperatures at all times.",2010,"Linjiao Luo, Marc Gershow, Mark Rosenzweig, Kyeongjin Kang, Christopher Fang-Yen, Paul A Garrity, Aravinthan D T Samuel, Linjiao Luo, Marc Gershow, Mark Rosenzweig, Kyeongjin Kang, Christopher Fang-Yen, Paul A Garrity, Aravinthan D T Samuel"

We eliminated intralocus conflict in Drosophila melanogaster by limiting transmission of all major chromosomes to males, thereby allowing them to win the intersexual tug-of-war. Here, we show that this male-limited (ML) evolution treatment led to the evolution (in both sexes) of masculinized wing morphology, body size, growth rate, wing loading, and allometry. In addition to more male-like size and shape, ML evolution resulted in an increase in developmental stability for males. However, females expressing ML chromosomes were less developmentally stable, suggesting that being ontogenetically more male-like was disruptive to development. We suggest that sexual selection over size and shape of the imago may therefore explain the persistence of substantial genetic variation in these characters and the ontogenetic processes underlying them.",2010,"J K Abbott, S Bedhomme, A K Chippindale, J K Abbott, S Bedhomme, A K Chippindale"
Genomic instability of I elements of Drosophila melanogaster in absence of dysgenic crosses,20957225,10.1371/journal.pone.0013142,"Retrotranspostion of I factors in the female germline of Drosophila melanogaster is responsible for the so called I-R hybrid dysgenesis, a phenomenon that produces a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities including reduced fertility, increased frequency of mutations and chromosome loss. Transposition of I factor depends on cellular conditions that are established in the oocytes of the reactive females and transmitted to their daughters. The so-called reactivity is a cellular state that may exhibit variable levels of expression and represents a permissive condition for I transposition at high levels. Defective I elements have been proposed to be the genetic determinants of reactivity and, through their differential expression, to modulate transposition of active copies in somatic and/or germ line cells. Recently, control of transposable element activity in the germ line has been found to depend on pi-RNAs, small repressive RNAs interacting with Piwi-family proteins and derived from larger transposable elements (TE)-derived primary transcripts. In particular, maternally transmitted I-element piRNAs originating from the 42AB region of polytene chromosomes were found to be involved in control of I element mobility. In the present work, we use a combination of cytological and molecular approaches to study the activity of I elements in three sublines of the inducer y; cn bw; sp isogenic strain and in dysgenic and non-dysgenic genetic backgrounds. Overall, the results of FISH and Southern blotting experiments clearly show that I elements are highly unstable in the Montpellier subline in the absence of classical dysgenic conditions. Such instability appears to be correlated to the amount of 5' and 3' I element transcripts detected by quantitative and real-time RT-PCR. The results of this study indicate that I elements can be highly active in the absence of a dysgenic crosses.

Drosophila Mtm and class II PI3K coregulate a PI(3)P pool with cortical and endolysosomal functions,20696708,10.1083/jcb.200911020,"Reversible phosphoinositide phosphorylation provides a dynamic membrane code that balances opposing cell functions. However, in vivo regulatory relationships between specific kinases, phosphatases, and phosphoinositide subpools are not clear. We identified myotubularin (mtm), a Drosophila melanogaster MTM1/MTMR2 phosphoinositide phosphatase, as necessary and sufficient for immune cell protrusion formation and recruitment to wounds. Mtm-mediated turnover of endosomal phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) pools generated by both class II and III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (Pi3K68D and Vps34, respectively) is needed to down-regulate membrane influx, promote efflux, and maintain endolysosomal homeostasis. Endocytosis, but not endolysosomal size, contributes to cortical remodeling by mtm function. We propose that Mtm-dependent regulation of an endosomal PI(3)P pool has separable consequences for endolysosomal homeostasis and cortical remodeling. Pi3K68D depletion (but not Vps34) rescues protrusion and distribution defects in mtm-deficient immune cells and restores functions in other tissues essential for viability.

Production of reactive oxygen species by the mitochondrial electron transport chain in Drosophila melanogaster,20300811,10.1007/s10863-010-9281-z,"Mitochondrial free radicals and in particular mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species (mtROS) are considered to be totally or partially responsible for several different diseases including Parkinson, diabetes or cancer. Even more importantly, mtROS have also been proposed as the main driving force behind the aging process. Thus, in the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the role of free radicals as signalling molecules. Collectively this makes understanding mechanisms controlling free radical production extremely important. There is extensive published literature on mammalian models (essentially rat, mouse and guinea pig) however; this is not the case in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila is an excellent model to study different physiological and pathological processes. Additionally a robust method to study mtROS is extremely useful. In the present article, we describe a simple--but extremely sensitive--method to study mtROS production in Drosophila. We have performed various experiments to determine which specific respiratory complexes produce free radicals in the electron transport chain of Drosophila melanogaster. Complex I is the main generator of ROS in Drosophila mitochondria, leaking electrons either in the forward or reverse direction. The production of ROS during reverse electron transport can be prevented either by rotenone or by the oxidation of NADH by complex I. These results clearly show that Drosophila mitochondria function in a very similar way to mammalian mitochondria, and therefore are a very relevant experimental model for biochemical studies related to ageing.",2010,"Alberto Sanz, Rhoda Stefanatos, George McIlroy, Alberto Sanz, Rhoda Stefanatos, George McIlroy"
Developmental and functional studies of the SLC12 gene family members from Drosophila melanogaster,19828839,10.1152/ajpcell.00376.2009,"The electroneutral cation-chloride cotransporter gene family, SLC12, contains nine members in vertebrates. These include seven sodium and/or potassium-coupled chloride transporters and two membrane proteins of unknown function. Although SLC12 family members have been identified in a number of lower species, the functional properties of these proteins are unknown. There are five SLC12 homologues in Drosophila melanogaster, including at least one member on each of the four main branches of the vertebrate phylogenetic tree. We have employed in situ hybridization to study the expression patterns of the Drosophila SLC12 proteins during embryonic development. Our studies indicate that all five members of this family are expressed during early embryogenesis (stages 1-6), but that spatial and temporal expression patterns become more refined as development proceeds. Expression during late embryogenesis was seen predominantly in the ventral nerve cord, salivary gland, gut, and anal pad. In parallel studies, we have carried out transport assays on each of the five Drosophila homologues, expressed as recombinant proteins in the cultured insect cell line High Five. Under our experimental conditions, we found that only one of these proteins, CG4357, transported the potassium congener (86)Rb. Additional experiments established that rubidium transport via CG4357 was saturable (K(m) = 0.29 +/- 0.05 mM), sodium-dependent (half-saturation constant = 53 +/- 11 mM), chloride-dependent (half-saturation constant = 48 +/- 5 mM), and potently inhibited by bumetanide (inhibitor constant = 1.17 +/- 0.08 muM), a specific inhibitor of Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporters. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence that CG4357 is an insect ortholog of the vertebrate Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporters.",2010,"Qifei Sun, E Tian, R James Turner, Kelly G Ten Hagen, Qifei Sun, E Tian, R James Turner, Kelly G Ten Hagen"

Ecdysone signaling and transcript signature in Drosophila cells resistant against methoxyfenozide,20816975,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.08.022,"Methoxyfenozide (RH-2485) is a non-steroidal ecdysteroid agonist with a dibenzoylhydrazine structure, representing a group used as novel biorational insecticides in the control of insect pests. Here we report on the selection of Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells for resistance to inhibition of cell proliferation by methoxyfenozide by ??1000-fold over 4 months. Cells were exposed to gradually increasing concentrations of methoxyfenozide and selected out based on the ecdysteroid-sensitive response for cell proliferation. In the resistant cells, the ecdysteroid receptor (EcR/USP) complex was no longer active in the presence of methoxyfenozide. But when resistant cells were relaxed from pressure in methoxyfenozide-free medium, induction of the reporter construct was observed. In parallel, EcR/USP functionality was also restored when resistant cells were rescued by a Drosophila EcR plasmid. However, it was striking that in the resistant cells the ecdysteroid-sensitive response for cell proliferation was not restored upon methoxyfenozide withdrawal, indicating permanent changes in the physiology of the cells during selection. To investigate changes in gene expression caused by inactivation of the EcR/USP complex in resistant cells, Drosophila oligo 14kv1 microarrays were used and probed with cDNAs from resistant cells in the presence and absence of ecdysone agonist on one hand and from unselected sensitive cells on the other hand. A selection of 324 differentially expressed genes was assigned covering diverse functions as transport, enzyme activity, cytoskeleton organization, cell cycle machinery, transcription/translation and ecdysteroid signaling.

Evening circadian oscillator as the primary determinant of rhythmic motivation for Drosophila courtship behavior,21083635,10.1111/j.1365-2443.2010.01456.x,"Circadian clocks of Drosophila melanogaster motivate males to court females at a specific time of day. However, clock neurons involved in courtship rhythms in the brain of Drosophila remain totally unknown. The circadian locomotor behavior of Drosophila is controlled by morning (M cells) and evening (E cells) cells in the brain, which regulate morning and evening activities, respectively. Here, we identified the brain clock neurons that are responsible for the circadian rhythms of the close-proximity (CP) behavior that reflects male courtship motivation. Interestingly, the ablation or functional molecular clock disruption of E cells caused arrhythmic CP behavior, but that of M cells resulted in sustained CP rhythms even in constant darkness. In addition, the ablation of some dorsal lateral neurons (LNd) of E cells using neuropeptide-F (NPF)-GAL4 did not impair CP rhythms. These findings suggested that the NPF-negative LNds and DN1s of E cells include cells essential for circadian CP behavior in Drosophila.",2010,"Yasutaka Hamasaka, Takahiro Suzuki, Shuji Hanai, Norio Ishida, Yasutaka Hamasaka, Takahiro Suzuki, Shuji Hanai, Norio Ishida"
ON and OFF pathways in Drosophila motion vision,21068841,10.1038/nature09545,"Motion vision is a major function of all visual systems, yet the underlying neural mechanisms and circuits are still elusive. In the lamina, the first optic neuropile of Drosophila melanogaster, photoreceptor signals split into five parallel pathways, L1-L5. Here we examine how these pathways contribute to visual motion detection by combining genetic block and reconstitution of neural activity in different lamina cell types with whole-cell recordings from downstream motion-sensitive neurons. We find reduced responses to moving gratings if L1 or L2 is blocked; however, reconstitution of photoreceptor input to only L1 or L2 results in wild-type responses. Thus, the first experiment indicates the necessity of both pathways, whereas the second indicates sufficiency of each single pathway. This contradiction can be explained by electrical coupling between L1 and L2, allowing for activation of both pathways even when only one of them receives photoreceptor input. A fundamental difference between the L1 pathway and the L2 pathway is uncovered when blocking L1 or L2 output while presenting moving edges of positive (ON) or negative (OFF) contrast polarity: blocking L1 eliminates the response to moving ON edges, whereas blocking L2 eliminates the response to moving OFF edges. Thus, similar to the segregation of photoreceptor signals in ON and OFF bipolar cell pathways in the vertebrate retina, photoreceptor signals segregate into ON-L1 and OFF-L2 channels in the lamina of Drosophila.",2010,"Maximilian Joesch, Bettina Schnell, Shamprasad Varija Raghu, Dierk F Reiff, Alexander Borst, Maximilian Joesch, Bettina Schnell, Shamprasad Varija Raghu, Dierk F Reiff, Alexander Borst"

To study the role of zyxin during development, we generated a zyx102 RNA-interference transgenic line that allows for the conditional knockdown of Zyx102. When UAST-zyx102-dsRNAi expression is driven broadly by Actin5C-GAL4, loss of Zyx102 results in lethality during the pharate adult stage, a narrow developmental window during which the fly must molt, resorb molting fluid, fill adult trachea with air, and execute a behavioral program to eclose.

Effects of zinc on programmed cell death of Musca domestica and Drosophila melanogaster blood cells,19941868,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2009.11.010,"Programmed cell death (PCD) and phagocytotic activity of immune cells play a pivotal role in insect development. We examined the influence of Zn(2+), an important element to fundamental biological processes, on phagocytosis and apoptosis of hemocytes in two fly species: Musca domestica and Drosophila melanogaster. Hemocytes were isolated from the third instar larvae of both species and treated for 3h with zinc chloride solutions, containing 0.35 mM or 1.7 mM of Zn(2+), and untreated as control. Phagocytotic activity of hemocytes was examined by flow cytometry after adding latex fluorescent beads to the medium, while apoptosis was evaluated by application of annexinV-FITC and pan-caspase-FITC inhibitor. Mitochondrial viability was determined by measuring resazurin absorbancy in the cell medium. The obtained results showed that Zn(2+) increases phagocytosis and affects PCD of both species hemocytes but each in a different way. Zinc decreases fraction of annexin-positive hemocytes in M. domestica but increases it in D. melanogaster. The pan-caspase analysis revealed low and high activity of caspases in hemocytes of M. domestica and D. melanogaster, respectively. Zn(2+) also decreased the viability of hemocyte mitochondria but only in D. melanogaster.

Evolution of diverse mechanisms for protecting chromosome ends by Drosophila TART telomere retrotransposons,21088221,10.1073/pnas.1015926107,"The retrotransposons HeT-A, TART, and TAHRE, which maintain Drosophila telomeres, transpose specifically onto chromosome ends to form long arrays that extend the chromosome and compensate for terminal loss. Because they transpose by target-primed reverse transcription, each element is oriented so that its 5' end serves as the extreme end of the chromosome until another element transposes to occupy the terminal position. Thus 5' sequences are at risk for terminal erosion while the element is at the chromosome end. Here we report that TART elements in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis show species-specific innovations in promoter architecture that buffer loss of sequence exposed at chromosome ends. The two elements have evolved different ways to effect this protection. The D. virilis TART (TART(vir)) promoter is found in the 3' UTR of the element directly upstream of the element transcribed. Transcription starts within the upstream element so that a ""Tag"" of extra sequence is added to the 5' end of the newly transcribed RNA. This Tag provides expendable sequence to buffer end erosion of essential 5' sequence after the RNA is reverse transcribed onto the chromosome. In contrast, the D. melanogaster TART (TART(mel)) promoter initiates transcription deep within the 5' UTR, but the element is able to replace and extend the 5' UTR sequence by copying sequence from its 3' UTR, we believe while being reverse transcribed onto the chromosome end. Astonishingly, end-protection in TART(vir) and HeT-A(mel) are essentially identical (using Tags), whereas HeT-A(vir) is clearly protected from end erosion by an as-yet-unspecified program.",2010,"Janet A George, Karen L Traverse, P G DeBaryshe, Kerry J Kelley, Mary-Lou Pardue, Janet A George, Karen L Traverse, P G DeBaryshe, Kerry J Kelley, Mary-Lou Pardue"
Two PABPC1-binding sites in GW182 proteins promote miRNA-mediated gene silencing,21063388,10.1038/emboj.2010.274,"miRNA-mediated gene silencing requires the GW182 proteins, which are characterized by an N-terminal domain that interacts with Argonaute proteins (AGOs), and a C-terminal silencing domain (SD). In Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) GW182 and a human (Hs) orthologue, TNRC6C, the SD was previously shown to interact with the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC1). Here, we show that two regions of GW182 proteins interact with PABPC1: the first contains a PABP-interacting motif 2 (PAM2; as shown before for TNRC6C) and the second contains the M2 and C-terminal sequences in the SD. The latter mediates indirect binding to the PABPC1 N-terminal domain. In D. melanogaster cells, the second binding site dominates; however, in HsTNRC6A-C the PAM2 motif is essential for binding to both Hs and DmPABPC1. Accordingly, a single amino acid substitution in the TNRC6A-C PAM2 motif abolishes the interaction with PABPC1. This mutation also impairs TNRC6s silencing activity. Our findings reveal that despite species-specific differences in the relative strength of the PABPC1-binding sites, the interaction between GW182 proteins and PABPC1 is critical for miRNA-mediated silencing in animal cells.",2010,"Eric Huntzinger, Joerg E Braun, Susanne HeimstÃ¤dt, Latifa Zekri, Elisa Izaurralde, Eric Huntzinger, Joerg E Braun, Susanne HeimstÃ¤dt, Latifa Zekri, Elisa Izaurralde"

In Drosophila, invading pathogens that pass through the epithelial barriers (a first line of self-defense) can encounter humoral and cellular responses that utilize pattern-recognition receptors to identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns in the hemolymph or on the immune cell surface. Some pathogens escape recognition and elimination in the hemolymph by invading the host cytoplasm.

Recombination yet inefficient selection along the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup's fourth chromosome,20008457,10.1093/molbev/msp291,"A central goal of evolutionary genetics is an understanding of the forces responsible for the observed variation, both within and between species. Theoretical and empirical work have demonstrated that genetic recombination contributes to this variation by breaking down linkage between nucleotide sites, thus allowing them to behave independently and for selective forces to act efficiently on them. The Drosophila fourth chromosome, which is believed to experience no-or very low-rates of recombination has been an important model for investigating these effects. Despite previous efforts, central questions regarding the extent of recombination and the predominant modes of selection acting on it remain open. In order to more comprehensively test hypotheses regarding recombination and its potential influence on selection along the fourth chromosome, we have resequenced regions from most of its genes from Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. yakuba. These data, along with available outgroup sequence, demonstrate that recombination is low but significantly greater than zero for the three species. Despite there being recombination, there is strong evidence that its frequency is low enough to have rendered selection relatively inefficient.

Effects of acute or chronic exposure to dietary organic anions on secretion of methotrexate and salicylate by Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster larvae,20077573,10.1002/arch.20346,"The effects of dietary exposure to organic anions on the physiology of isolated Malpighian tubules and on tubule gene expression were examined using larvae of Drosophila melanogaster. Acute (24 h) or chronic (7 d) exposure to type I organic anions (fluorescein or salicylate) was associated with increased fluid secretion rates and increased fluxes of both salicylate and the type II organic anion methotrexate. By contrast, chronic exposure to dietary methotrexate was associated with increased fluid secretion rate and increased flux of methotrexate, but not salicylate. Exposure to methotrexate in the diet resulted in increases in the expression of a multidrug efflux transporter gene (MET; CG30344) in the Malpighian tubules. There were also increases in expression of genes for either a Drosophila multidrug resistance-associated protein (dMRP; CG6214) or an organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP; CG3380), depending on the concentration of methotrexate in the diet. Exposure to salicylate in the diet was associated with an increase in expression of dMRP and with decreases of MET and OATP. Exposure to dietary salicylate or methotrexate was also associated with different patterns of expression of heat shock protein genes. The results suggest that exposure to specific type I or type II organic anions has multiple effects and results not only in increased organic anion transport but also in increased rates of inorganic ion transport, which drives osmotically-obliged fluid secretion. Increased fluid secretion may enhance secretion of organic anions by eliminating diffusive backflux from the tubule lumen to the hemolymph.",2010,"Sarah Chahine, Michael J O'Donnell, Sarah Chahine, Michael J O'Donnell"

These olfactory sensory neurons express IR64a, a member of the recently identified ionotropic receptor (IR) family of putative olfactory receptors. In vivo calcium imaging showed that IR64a+ neurons projecting to the DC4 glomerulus in the antennal lobe are specifically activated by acids. Flies in which the function of IR64a+ neurons or the IR64a gene is disrupted had defects in acid-evoked physiological and behavioural responses, but their responses to non-acidic odorants remained unaffected.

In humans, loss of ATM function is associated with ataxia telangiectasia, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by extreme sensitivity to DNA damage. Drosophila melanogaster has recently emerged as a useful animal model for analyzing the molecular functions of specific domains of this large, multifunctional kinase. The gene encoding Drosophila ATM kinase (dATM) was originally designated tefu because of the telomere fusion defects observed in atm mutants. In this report, molecular characterization of eight atm (tefu) alleles identified nonsense mutations predicted to truncate conserved C-terminal domains of the dATM protein, as well as two interesting missense mutations. One of these missense mutations localized within a putative HEAT repeat in the poorly characterized N-terminal domain of dATM (atm4), whereas another associated with a temperature-sensitive allele (atm8) changed the last amino acid of the conserved FATC domain.

Optogenetically Induced Olfactory Stimulation in Drosophila Larvae Reveals the Neuronal Basis of Odor-Aversion behavior,20577637,10.3389/fnbeh.2010.00027,"Olfactory stimulation induces an odor-guided crawling behavior of Drosophila melanogaster larvae characterized by either an attractive or a repellent reaction. In order to understand the underlying processes leading to these orientations we stimulated single olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) through photo-activation within an intact neuronal network. Using the Gal4-UAS system two light inducible proteins, the light-sensitive cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR-2) or the light-sensitive adenylyl cyclase (Pacalpha) were expressed in all or in individual ORNs of the larval olfactory system. Blue light stimulation caused an activation of these neurons, ultimately producing the illusion of an odor stimulus. Larvae were tested in a phototaxis assay for their orientation toward or away from the light source. Here we show that activation of Pacalpha expressing ORNs bearing the receptors Or33b or Or45a in blind norpA mutant larvae induces a repellent behavior away from the light. Conversely, photo-activation of the majority of ORNs induces attraction towards the light. Interestingly, in wild type larvae two ligands of Or33b and Or45a, octyl acetate and propionic ethylester, respectively, have been found to cause an escape reaction. Therefore, we combined light and odor stimulation to analyze the function of Or33b and Or45a expressing ORNs.

Drosophila male sex peptide inhibits siesta sleep and promotes locomotor activity in the post-mated female,19793753,10.1098/rspb.2009.1236,"Quiescence, or a sleep-like state, is a common and important feature of the daily lives of animals from both invertebrate and vertebrate taxa, suggesting that sleep appeared early in animal evolution. Recently, Drosophila melanogaster has been shown to be a relevant and powerful model for the genetic analysis of sleep behaviour. The sleep architecture of D. melanogaster is sexually dimorphic, with females sleeping much less than males during day-time, presumably because reproductive success requires greater foraging activity by the female as well as the search for egg-laying sites. However, this loss of sleep and increase in locomotor activity will heighten the risk for the female from environmental and predator hazards. In this study, we show that virgin females can minimize this risk by behaving like males, with an extended afternoon 'siesta'. Copulation results in the female losing 70 per cent of day-time sleep and becoming more active. This behaviour lasts for at least 8 days after copulation and is abolished if the mating males lack sex peptide (SP), normally present in the seminal fluid. Our results suggest that SP is the molecular switch that promotes wakefulness in the post-mated female, a change of behaviour compatible with increased foraging and egg-laying activity. The stress resulting from SP-dependent sleep deprivation might be an important contribution to the toxic side-effects of male accessory gland products that are known to reduce lifespan in post-mated females.",2010,"R Elwyn Isaac, Chenxi Li, Amy E Leedale, Alan D Shirras, R Elwyn Isaac, Chenxi Li, Amy E Leedale, Alan D Shirras"

We have tested the ability of mini-white to be used as a marker for insertional mutagenesis, and have observed mini-white derived pigmentation of the testes sheath in a subset of lines from D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis. We have incorporated a source of piggyBac transposase into nine Drosophila species, and have demonstrated the functionality of these transposase lines for mobilization of marked inserts in vivo.

This is due to the intrinsic nature of this genetic element, namely, (1) its molecular composition (mainly transposable elements and satellite DNA), (2) its genetic inertia (lack of recombination due to its heterochromatic nature), (3) the absence of homology with the X (with the only exception of the nucleolar organizer), (4) the lack of visible phenotypes when it is missing (indeed, except for their sterility, X0 flies are normal males), and (5) its low density as for protein-coding sequences (to date, only 13 genes out of approximately 14,000 have been mapped on this chromosome in D. melanogaster, i.e., ~0.1% of the total). Nonetheless, a more accurate analysis reveals that this chromosome can influence several complex phenotypes: (1) it has a role in the fertility of both sexes and viability of males when over-represented; (2) it can unbalance the intracellular nucleotide pool; (3) it can interfere with the gene expression either by recruiting proteins involved in chromatin remodeling (PEV) or, to a higher extent, by influencing the expression of up to 1,000 different genes, probably by changing the availability of transcription factors; (4) it plays a major role (up to 50%) in the resistance to heat-induced male sterility; (5) it affects the behavior; and (6) it plays a role in genetic imprinting. In the present paper, all these Y-related phenotypes are described and a potential similarity with the human Y chromosome is drawn.",2010,"Roberto Piergentili, Roberto Piergentili"
The interphase microtubule aster is a determinant of asymmetric division orientation in Drosophila neuroblasts,20194641,10.1083/jcb.200905024,"The mechanisms that maintain the orientation of cortical polarity and asymmetric division unchanged in consecutive mitoses in Drosophila melanogaster neuroblasts (NBs) are unknown. By studying the effect of transient microtubule depolymerization and centrosome mutant conditions, we have found that such orientation memory requires both the centrosome-organized interphase aster and centrosome-independent functions. We have also found that the span of such memory is limited to the last mitosis. Furthermore, the orientation of the NB axis of polarity can be reset to any angle with respect to the surrounding tissue and is, therefore, cell autonomous.",2010,"Jens Januschke, Cayetano Gonzalez, Jens Januschke, Cayetano Gonzalez"
Locomotor activity level monitoring using the Drosophila Activity Monitoring (DAM) System,21041391,10.1101/pdb.prot5518,"Adult behavioral assays have been used with great success in Drosophila melanogaster to identify circadian rhythm genes. In particular, the locomotor activity assay can identify altered behavior patterns over the course of several days in small populations, or even individual flies. Commercially available, highly efficient automated systems allow for continuous data collection from large numbers of individuals, and analytical tools make it possible to quickly analyze multiple aspects of circadian behavior from each experiment. These features make the locomotor activity assay useful for high-throughput analyses, leading to the rapid discovery and functional characterization of many Drosophila circadian rhythm genes. The locomotor assay described here can simultaneously assess both circadian and sleep behavior, and several methods can be used to analyze the data generated from such assays. This protocol details the use of the Drosophila Activity Monitoring (DAM) System from TriKinetics. Briefly, the system records activity from individual flies maintained in sealed tubes placed in activity monitors. An infrared beam directed through the midpoint of each tube measures an ""activity event"" each time a fly crosses the beam. Events detected over the course of each consecutive sampling interval are summed and recorded over the course of the experiment for each fly. The general approaches described here can be applied to a wide range of behavioral activity experiments, including sleep deprivation analyses and general studies of hypoactivity and hyperactivity.",2010,"Cory Pfeiffenberger, Bridget C Lear, Kevin P Keegan, Ravi Allada, Cory Pfeiffenberger, Bridget C Lear, Kevin P Keegan, Ravi Allada"
Chlorpyrifos induces apoptosis and DNA damage in Drosophila through generation of reactive oxygen species,20627310,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2010.05.013,"The present study investigated the apoptosis and DNA damage inducing potential of chlorpyrifos (CP) in Drosophila melanogaster. Third instar larvae of Drosophila were treated with different concentrations of CP (0.015-15.0 microg/L) for 2-48 h. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, oxidative stress markers, DNA damage and apoptotic cell death end points were measured in them. A significant increase in DNA damage was concomitant with apoptotic mode of cell death in 15.0 microg/L CP-treated organisms for 24 and 48 h. Depolarization in mitochondrial membrane potential and increased casapase-3 and caspase-9 activities in these organisms indicated both as potential targets of CP. A significant positive correlation was observed among ROS generation, apoptosis and DNA damage.

Phosphorylation alters tau distribution and elongates life span in Drosophila,20555141,10.3233/JAD-2010-091678,"The microtubule-associated tau protein has long been considered an axon-specific protein. Although many articles describe the subcellular localization of tau as regulated by post-modification in cultured cells, the intracellular regulation of its distribution in living animals has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrate that phosphorylation alters tau polarity in Drosophila melanogaster. Interestingly, it was observed that expression of phosphorylation-incompetent tau impaired neurite growth more severely than either hyperphosphorylated or pseudophosphorylated tau. We also found that inducible expression of hyper- or pseudo-phosphorylated tau in adult flies strikingly prolonged their lifespan. This study offers an alternative tauopathic model by demonstrating that hyperphosphorylated tau has a beneficial effect on the nervous system. This is also corroborated by common effects seen in a variety of organisms in response to various stresses. We hope that this important animal model leads to a paradigm shift in thinking about hyperphosphorylated tau, which plays a protective role in nervous systems rather than the toxic role that many have historically been given to it.",2010,"Po-An Yeh, Ching-Jin Chang, Pong-Hsien Tu, Harry Iain Wilson, Ju-Yi Chien, Chiou-Yang Tang, Ming-Tsan Su, Po-An Yeh, Ching-Jin Chang, Pong-Hsien Tu, Harry Iain Wilson, Ju-Yi Chien, Chiou-Yang Tang, Ming-Tsan Su"
Analyses of nuclearly encoded mitochondrial genes suggest gene duplication as a mechanism for resolving intralocus sexually antagonistic conflict in Drosophila,21037198,10.1093/gbe/evq069,"Gene duplication is probably the most important mechanism for generating new gene functions. However, gene duplication has been overlooked as a potentially effective way to resolve genetic conflicts. Here, we analyze the entire set of Drosophila melanogaster nuclearly encoded mitochondrial duplicate genes and show that both RNA- and DNA-mediated mitochondrial gene duplications exhibit an unexpectedly high rate of relocation (change in location between parental and duplicated gene) as well as an extreme tendency to avoid the X chromosome. These trends are likely related to our observation that relocated genes tend to have testis-specific expression. We also infer that these trends hold across the entire Drosophila genus. Importantly, analyses of gene ontology and functional interaction networks show that there is an overrepresentation of energy production-related functions in these mitochondrial duplicates. We discuss different hypotheses to explain our results and conclude that our findings substantiate the hypothesis that gene duplication for male germline function is likely a mechanism to resolve intralocus sexually antagonistic conflicts that we propose are common in testis. In the case of nuclearly encoded mitochondrial duplicates, our hypothesis is that past sexually antagonistic conflict related to mitochondrial energy function in Drosophila was resolved by gene duplication.",2010,"Miguel Gallach, Chitra Chandrasekaran, Esther BetrÃ¡n, Miguel Gallach, Chitra Chandrasekaran, Esther BetrÃ¡n"
A novel function for the PAR complex in subcellular morphogenesis of tracheal terminal cells in Drosophila melanogaster,21750259,10.1534/genetics.111.130351,"The processes that generate cellular morphology are not well understood. To investigate this problem, we use Drosophila melanogaster tracheal terminal cells, which undergo two distinct morphogenetic processes: subcellular branching morphogenesis and subcellular apical lumen formation. Here we show these processes are regulated by components of the PAR-polarity complex. This complex, composed of the proteins Par-6, Bazooka (Par-3), aPKC, and Cdc42, is best known for roles in asymmetric cell division and apical/basal polarity. We find Par-6, Bazooka, and aPKC, as well as known interactions between them, are required for subcellular branch initiation, but not for branch outgrowth. By analysis of single and double mutants, and isolation of two novel alleles of Par-6, one of which specifically truncates the Par-6 PDZ domain, we conclude that dynamic interactions between apical PAR-complex members control the branching pattern of terminal cells. These data suggest that canonical apical PAR-complex activity is required for subcellular branching morphogenesis. In addition, we find the PAR proteins are downstream of the FGF pathway that controls terminal cell branching. In contrast, we find that while Par-6 and aPKC are both required for subcellular lumen formation, neither Bazooka nor a direct interaction between Par-6 and aPKC is needed for this process. Thus a novel, noncanonical role for the polarity proteins Par-6 and aPKC is used in formation of this subcellular apical compartment. Our results demonstrate that proteins from the PAR complex can be deployed independently within a single cell to control two different morphogenetic processes.",2011,"Tiffani A Jones, Mark M Metzstein, Tiffani A Jones, Mark M Metzstein"
Host and pathogen glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins modulate antimicrobial peptide responses in Drosophila melanogaster,21078848,10.1128/IAI.00254-10,"During group B streptococcal infection, the alpha C protein (ACP) on the bacterial surface binds to host cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and facilitates entry of bacteria into human epithelial cells. Previous studies in a Drosophila melanogaster model showed that binding of ACP to the sulfated polysaccharide chains (glycosaminoglycans) of HSPGs promotes host death and is associated with higher bacterial burdens. We hypothesized that ACP-glycosaminoglycan binding might determine infection outcome by altering host responses to infection, such as expression of antimicrobial peptides. As glycosaminoglycans/HSPGs also interact with a number of endogenous secreted signaling molecules in Drosophila, we examined the effects of host and pathogen glycosaminoglycan/HSPG-binding structures in host survival of infection and antimicrobial peptide expression. Strikingly, host survival after infection with wild-type streptococci was enhanced among flies overexpressing the endogenous glycosaminoglycan/HSPG-binding morphogen Decapentaplegic-a transforming growth factor Î²-like Drosophila homolog of mammalian bone morphogenetic proteins-but not by flies overexpressing a mutant, non-glycosaminoglycan-binding Decapentaplegic, or the other endogenous glycosaminoglycan/HSPG-binding morphogens, Hedgehog and Wingless. While ACP-glycosaminoglycan binding was associated with enhanced transcription of peptidoglycan recognition proteins and antimicrobial peptides, Decapentaplegic overexpression suppressed transcription of these genes during streptococcal infection. Further, the glycosaminoglycan-binding domain of ACP competed with Decapentaplegic for binding to the soluble glycosaminoglycan heparin in an in vitro assay. These data suggest that, in addition to promoting bacterial entry into host cells, ACP competes with Decapentaplegic for binding to glycosaminoglycans/HSPGs during infection and that these bacterial and endogenous glycosaminoglycan-binding structures determine host survival and regulate antimicrobial peptide transcription.",2011,"Zhipeng Wang, Lindsay A Flax, Melissa M Kemp, Robert J Linhardt, Miriam J Baron, Zhipeng Wang, Lindsay A Flax, Melissa M Kemp, Robert J Linhardt, Miriam J Baron"
Differential sensitivity of Ctenocephalides felis and Drosophila melanogaster nicotinic acetylcholine receptor Î±1 and Î±2 subunits in recombinant hybrid receptors to nicotinoids and neonicotinoid insecticides,20933086,10.1016/j.ibmb.2010.09.012,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are the binding sites for nicotinoid drugs, such as nicotine and epibatidine, and are the molecular targets of the selectively insecticidal neonicotinoids. In this study we report the full length cDNA cloning of the three Ctenocephalides (C.) felis (cat flea) nAChR Î± subunits CfÎ±1, CfÎ±2, and CfÎ±3. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes as hybrid receptors with the Gallus gallus (chicken) Î²2 (GgÎ²2) subunit, these cat flea Î± subunits formed acetylcholine-responsive ion channels. Acetylcholine-evoked currents of CfÎ±2/GgÎ²2 were resistant to Î±-bungarotoxin, while those of CfÎ±1/GgÎ²2 were sensitive to this snake toxin. The pharmacological profiles of CfÎ±1/GgÎ²2, CfÎ±2/GgÎ²2 and the chicken neuronal receptor GgÎ±4/GgÎ²2 for acetylcholine, two nicotinoids and 6 insecticidal neonicotinoids were determined and compared. Particularly remarkable was the finding that CfÎ±1/GgÎ²2 was far more sensitive to acetylcholine, nicotine and neonicotinoid agonists than either CfÎ±2/GgÎ²2 or GgÎ±4/GgÎ²2: for the anti flea neonicotinoid market compound imidacloprid the respective EC?â?s were 0.02 Î¼M, 1.31 Î¼M and 10 Î¼M. These results were confirmed for another insect species, Drosophila melanogaster, where the pharmacological profile of the DmÎ±1 and DmÎ±2 subunits as hybrid receptors with GgÎ²2 in Xenopus oocyte expressions resulted in a similar sensitivity pattern as those identified for the C. felis orthologs. Our results show that at least in a GgÎ²2 hybrid receptor setting, insect Î±1 subunits confer higher sensitivity to neonicotinoids than Î±2 subunits, which may contribute in vivo to the insect-selective action of this pesticide class.",2011,"Helene Dederer, Margaret Werr, Thomas Ilg, Helene Dederer, Margaret Werr, Thomas Ilg"
Analysis of thioester-containing proteins during the innate immune response of Drosophila melanogaster,21063077,10.1159/000321554,"Thioester-containing proteins (TEPs) are conserved proteins among insects that are thought to be involved in innate immunity. In Drosophila, the Tep family is composed of 6 genes named Tep1-Tep6. In this study, we investigated the phylogeny, expression pattern and roles of these genes in the host defense of Drosophila. Protostomian Tep genes are clustered in 3 distinct branches, 1 of which is specific to mosquitoes. Most D. melanogaster Tep genes are expressed in hemocytes, can be induced in the fat body, and are expressed in specific regions of the hypodermis. This expression pattern is consistent with a role in innate immunity. However, we find that TEP1, TEP2, and TEP4 are not strictly required in the body cavity to fight several bacterial and fungal infections. One possibility is that Drosophila TEPs act redundantly or that their absence can be compensated by other components of the immune response. TEPs may thus provide a subtle selective advantage during evolution. Alternatively, they may be required in host defense against specific as yet unidentified natural pathogens of Drosophila.",2011,"Richard Bou Aoun, Charles Hetru, Laurent Troxler, Daniel Doucet, Dominique Ferrandon, Nicolas Matt, Richard Bou Aoun, Charles Hetru, Laurent Troxler, Daniel Doucet, Dominique Ferrandon, Nicolas Matt"

We include a fifth isoform in this study, named MtnE, and recently annotated. The MTs polymorphism pattern is essentially the same for the 12 Drosophila species. Invariably, a MtnA form and an MtnB-cluster, comprising the MtnB-to-MtnE forms in tandem array, are observed. The whole set of genes are kept in the same synteny element (Muller E), but implicated in rearrangement events (mainly inversions), encompassing all or some of the isogenes.

      The Australian sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) is a destructive pest of the sheep, a model organism for insecticide resistance research, and a valuable tool for medical and forensic professionals. However, genomic information on L. cuprina is still sparse.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We report here the construction of an embryonic and 2 larval cDNA libraries for L. cuprina. A total of 29,816 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were obtained and assembled into 7,464 unique clusters. The sequence collection captures a great diversity of genes, including those related to insecticide resistance (e.g., 12 cytochrome P450s, 2 glutathione S transferases, and 6 esterases). Compared to Drosophila melanogaster, codon preference is different in 13 of the 18 amino acids encoded by redundant codons, reflecting the lower overall GC content in L. cuprina. In addition, we demonstrated that the ESTs could be converted into informative gene markers by capitalizing on the known gene structures in the model organism D. melanogaster. We successfully assigned 41 genes to their respective chromosomes in L. cuprina. The relative locations of these loci revealed high but incomplete chromosomal synteny between L. cuprina and D. melanogaster.

Ectopic eyes are induced in definite regions of the wing disc and form a stable pattern on the wing of an adult fly. Here, we have shown that the ectopic expression of Wg inhibits the formation of ectopic eyes, and conversely the expression of Wg is reduced in the sites of ectopic Ey expression. Experiments with overexpression of the vesicular traffic protein H rs capable of inhibiting the Wg signaling agree with the notion on antagonism of Wg and Ey in ectopic eyes.

The Putzig-NURF nucleosome remodeling complex is required for ecdysone receptor signaling and innate immunity in Drosophila melanogaster,21385730,10.1534/genetics.111.127795,"Putzig (Pzg) was originally identified as being an integral component of the TRF2/DREF complex in Drosophila melanogaster, thereby regulating the transcriptional activation of replication-related genes. In a DREF-independent manner, Pzg was shown to mediate Notch target gene activation. This function of Pzg entails an association with the nucleosome remodeling factor complex NURF, which directly binds the ecdysone receptor EcR and coregulates targets of the EcR via the NURF-specific subunit Nurf-301. In contrast, Nurf-301 acts as a negative regulator of JAK/STAT signaling. Here, we provide evidence to show that Pzg is fundamental for these functions of NURF, apart from the regulation of Notch signaling activity. A jump-out mutagenesis provided us with a pzg null mutant displaying early larval lethality, defects in growth, and molting accompanied by aberrant feeding behavior. We show that Pzg is associated with EcR in vivo and required for the transcriptional induction of EcR target genes, whereas reduced ecdysteroid levels imply a NURF-independent function of Pzg. Moreover, pzg interferes with JAK/STAT-signaling activity by acting as a corepressor of Ken. Lamellocyte differentiation was consistently affected in a JAK/STAT mutant background and the expression level of defense response genes was elevated in pzg mutants, leading to the formation of melanotic tumors. Our results suggest that Pzg acts as an important partner of NURF in the regulation of EcR and JAK/STAT signaling.",2011,"Sabrina J Kugler, Eva-Maria Gehring, Veronika Wallkamm, Victoria KrÃ¼ger, Anja C Nagel, Sabrina J Kugler, Eva-Maria Gehring, Veronika Wallkamm, Victoria KrÃ¼ger, Anja C Nagel"

Sound production during agonistic behavior of male Drosophila melanogaster,20953152,10.4161/fly.5.1.13713,"Male Drosophila fruit flies acquire and defend territories in order to attract females for reproduction. Both, male-directed agonistic behavior and female-directed courtship consist of series of recurrent stereotypical components. Various studies demonstrated the importance of species-specific sound patterns generated by wing vibration as being critical for male courtship success. In this study we analyzed the patterns and importance of sound signals generated during agonistic interactions of male Drosophila melanogaster. In contrast to acoustic courtship signals that consist of sine and pulse patterns and are generated by one extended wing, agonistic signals lack sine-like components and are generally produced by simultaneous movements of both wings. Though intra-pulse oscillation frequencies (carrier frequency) are identical, inter-pulse intervals are twice as long and more variable in aggression signals than in courtship songs, where their precise temporal pattern serves species recognition. Acoustic signals accompany male agonistic interactions over their entire course but occur particularly often after tapping behavior which is a major way to identify the gender of the interaction partner. Since similar wing movements may either be silent or generate sound and wing movements with sound have a greater impact on the subsequent behavior of a receiver, sound producing wing movements seem to be generated intentionally to serve as a specific signal during fruit fly agonistic encounters.",2011,"Thorin Jonsson, Edward A Kravitz, Ralf Heinrich, Thorin Jonsson, Edward A Kravitz, Ralf Heinrich"
The P-element-induced silencing effect of KP transposons is dose dependent in Drosophila melanogaster,21888571,10.1139/g11-023,"Transposable elements are found in the genomes of all eukaryotes and play a critical role in altering gene expression and genome organization. In Drosophila melanogaster, transposable P elements are responsible for the phenomenon of hybrid dysgenesis. KP elements, a deletion-derivative of the complete P element, can suppress this mutagenic effect. KP elements can also silence the expression of certain other P-element-mediated transgenes in a process called P-element-dependent silencing (PDS), which is thought to involve the recruitment of heterochromatin proteins. To explore the mechanism of this silencing, we have mobilized KP elements to create a series of strains that contain single, well-defined KP insertions that show PDS. To understand the quantitative role of KP elements in PDS, these single inserts were combined in a series of crosses to obtain genotypes with zero, one, or two KP elements, from which we could examine the effect of KP gene dose. The extent of PDS in these genotypes was shown to be dose dependent in a logarithmic rather than linear fashion. A logarithmic dose dependency is consistent with the KP products interacting with heterochromatic proteins in a concentration-dependent manner such that two molecules are needed to induce gene silencing.",2011,"Alireza Sameny, John Locke, Alireza Sameny, John Locke"

Homologous pairing and the role of pairing centers in meiosis,21625006,10.1242/jcs.006387,"Homologous pairing establishes the foundation for accurate reductional segregation during meiosis I in sexual organisms. This Commentary summarizes recent progress in our understanding of homologous pairing in meiosis, and will focus on the characteristics and mechanisms of specialized chromosome sites, called pairing centers (PCs), in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. In C. elegans, each chromosome contains a single PC that stabilizes chromosome pairing and initiates synapsis of homologous chromosomes. Specific zinc-finger proteins recruited to PCs link chromosomes to nuclear envelope proteins--and through them to the microtubule cytoskeleton--thereby stimulating chromosome movements in early prophase, which are thought to be important for homolog sorting. This mechanism appears to be a variant of the 'telomere bouquet' process, in which telomeres cluster on the nuclear envelope, connect chromosomes through nuclear envelope proteins to the cytoskeleton and lead chromosome movements that promote homologous synapsis. In Drosophila males, which undergo meiosis without recombination, pairing of the largely non-homologous X and Y chromosomes occurs at specific repetitive sequences in the ribosomal DNA. Although no other clear examples of PC-based pairing mechanisms have been described, there is evidence for special roles of telomeres and centromeres in aspects of chromosome pairing, synapsis and segregation; these roles are in some cases similar to those of PCs.",2011,"Jui-He Tsai, Bruce D McKee, Jui-He Tsai, Bruce D McKee"
Dopamine in Drosophila: setting arousal thresholds in a miniature brain,21208962,10.1098/rspb.2010.2564,"In mammals, the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) modulates a variety of behaviours, although DA function is mostly associated with motor control and reward.

How can a single molecule play so many different roles? Adaptive changes within the DA system, anatomical specificity of action and effects on a variety of behaviours highlight the remarkable versatility of this neurotransmitter. Recent genetic and pharmacological manipulations of DA signalling in Drosophila have launched a surfeit of stories-each arguing for modulation of some aspect of the fly's waking (and sleeping) life. Although these stories often seem distinct and unrelated, there are some unifying themes underlying DA function and arousal states in this insect model. One of the central roles played by DA may involve perceptual suppression, a necessary component of both sleep and selective attention.",2011,"Bruno Van Swinderen, Rozi Andretic, Bruno Van Swinderen, Rozi Andretic"
Drosophila sex combs as a model of evolutionary innovations,23016935,10.1111/j.1525-142X.2011.00507.x,"The diversity of animal and plant forms is shaped by nested evolutionary innovations. Understanding the genetic and molecular changes responsible for these innovations is therefore one of the key goals of evolutionary biology. From the genetic point of view, the origin of novel traits implies the origin of new regulatory pathways to control their development. To understand how these new pathways are assembled in the course of evolution, we need model systems that combine relatively recent innovations with a powerful set of genetic and molecular tools. One such model is provided by the Drosophila sex comb-a male-specific morphological structure that evolved in a relatively small lineage related to the model species D. melanogaster. Our extensive knowledge of sex comb development in D. melanogaster provides the basis for investigating the genetic changes responsible for sex comb origin and diversification. At the same time, sex combs can change on microevolutionary timescales and differ spectacularly among closely related species, providing opportunities for direct genetic analysis and for integrating developmental and population-genetic approaches. Sex comb evolution is associated with the origin of novel interactions between Hox and sex determination genes. Activity of the sex determination pathway was brought under the control of the Hox code to become segment-specific, while Hox gene expression became sexually dimorphic. At the same time, both Hox and sex determination genes were integrated into the intrasegmental spatial patterning network, and acquired new joint downstream targets. Phylogenetic analysis shows that similar sex comb morphologies evolved independently in different lineages. Convergent evolution at the phenotypic level reflects convergent changes in the expression of Hox and sex determination genes, involving both independent gains and losses of regulatory interactions. However, the downstream cell-differentiation programs have diverged between species, and in some lineages, similar adult morphologies are produced by different morphogenetic mechanisms. These features make the sex comb an excellent model for examining not only the genetic changes responsible for its evolution, but also the cellular processes that translate DNA sequence changes into morphological diversity. The origin and diversification of sex combs provides insights into the roles of modularity, cooption, and regulatory changes in evolutionary innovations, and can serve as a model for understanding the origin of the more drastic novelties that define higher order taxa.",2011,"Artyom Kopp, Artyom Kopp"

A comparison of the larvae acclimated at constant 25Â°C with those acclimated at constant 15Â°C followed by constant 6Â°C for 2 d (15Â°C??Â°C) showed that long-term cold acclimation extended the lethal time for 50% of the population (Lt(50)) during exposure to constant 0Â°C as much as 630-fold (from 0.137 h to 86.658 h). Such marked physiological plasticity in Lt(50) (in contrast to LLT) suggested that chronic indirect chilling injury at 0Â°C differs from that caused by cold shock. Long-term cold acclimation modified the metabolomic profiles of the larvae. Accumulations of proline (up to 17.7 mM) and trehalose (up to 36.5 mM) were the two most prominent responses. In addition, restructuring of the glycerophospholipid composition of biological membranes was observed. The relative proportion of glycerophosphoethanolamines (especially those with linoleic acid at the sn-2 position) increased at the expense of glycerophosphocholines.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:

FlyExpress: visual mining of spatiotemporal patterns for genes and publications in Drosophila embryogenesis,21994220,10.1093/bioinformatics/btr567,"Summary:
      
    

    
      Images containing spatial expression patterns illuminate the roles of different genes during embryogenesis. In order to generate initial clues to regulatory interactions, biologists frequently need to know the set of genes expressed at the same time at specific locations in a developing embryo, as well as related research publications. However, text-based mining of image annotations and research articles cannot produce all relevant results, because the primary data are images that exist as graphical objects. We have developed a unique knowledge base (FlyExpress) to facilitate visual mining of images from Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis. By clicking on specific locations in pictures of fly embryos from different stages of development and different visual projections, users can produce a list of genes and publications instantly. In FlyExpress, each queryable embryo picture is a heat-map that captures the expression patterns of more than 4500 genes and more than 2600 published articles. In addition, one can view spatial patterns for particular genes over time as well as find other genes with similar expression patterns at a given developmental stage. Therefore, FlyExpress is a unique tool for mining spatiotemporal expression patterns in a format readily accessible to the scientific community.

Dietary epicatechin promotes survival of obese diabetic mice and Drosophila melanogaster,21525262,10.3945/jn.110.134270,"The lifespan of diabetic patients is 7-8 y shorter than that of the general population because of hyperglycemia-induced vascular complications and damage to other organs such as the liver and skeletal muscle. Here, we investigated the effects of epicatechin, one of the major flavonoids in cocoa, on health-promoting effects in obese diabetic (db/db) mice (0.25% in drinking water for 15 wk) and Drosophila melanogaster (0.01-8 mmol/L in diet). Dietary intake of epicatechin promoted survival in the diabetic mice (50% mortality in diabetic control group vs. 8.4% in epicatechin group after 15 wk of treatment), whereas blood pressure, blood glucose, food intake, and body weight gain were not significantly altered. Pathological analysis showed that epicatechin administration reduced the degeneration of aortic vessels and blunted fat deposition and hydropic degeneration in the liver caused by diabetes. Epicatechin treatment caused changes in diabetic mice that are associated with a healthier and longer lifespan, including improved skeletal muscle stress output, reduced systematic inflammation markers and serum LDL cholesterol, increased hepatic antioxidant glutathione concentration and total superoxide dismutase activity, decreased circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (from 303 Â± 21 mg/L in the diabetic control group to 189 Â± 21 mg/L in the epicatechin-treated group), and improved AMP-activated protein kinase-Î± activity in the liver and skeletal muscle. Consistently, epicatechin (0.1-8 mmol/L) also promoted survival and increased mean lifespan of Drosophila.

From L-dopa to dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde: a toxic biochemical pathway plays a vital physiological function in insects,21283636,10.1371/journal.pone.0016124,"One protein in Aedes aegypti, classified into the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) family based on extremely high sequence homology (??0%) with dopa decarboxylase (Ddc), was biochemically investigated. Our data revealed that this predicted AAAD protein use L-dopa as a substrate, as does Ddc, but it catalyzes the production of 3,4-dihydroxylphenylacetaldehyde (DHPAA) directly from L-dopa and apparently has nothing to do with the production of any aromatic amine. The protein is therefore named DHPAA synthase. This subsequently led to the identification of the same enzyme in Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus by an initial prediction of putative DHPAA synthase based on sequence homology and subsequent verification of DHPAA synthase identity through protein expression and activity assays. DHPAA is highly toxic because its aldehyde group readily reacts with the primary amino groups of proteins, leading to protein crosslinking and inactivation. It has previously been demonstrated by several research groups that Drosophila DHPAA synthase was expressed in tissues that produce cuticle materials and apparent defects in regions of colorless, flexible cuticular structures have been observed in its gene mutants. The presence of free amino groups in proteins, the high reactivity of DHPAA with the free amino groups, and the genetically ascertained function of the Drosophila DHPAA synthase in the formation of colorless, flexible cuticle, when taken together, suggest that mosquito and Drosophila DHPAA synthases are involved in the formation of flexible cuticle through their reactive DHPAA-mediated protein crosslinking reactions.

MAP4K3 is a component of the TORC1 signalling complex that modulates cell growth and viability in Drosophila melanogaster,21267071,10.1371/journal.pone.0014528,"Background:
      
    

    
      MAP4K3 is a conserved Ser/Thr kinase that has being found in connection with several signalling pathways, including the Imd, EGFR, TORC1 and JNK modules, in different organisms and experimental assays. We have analyzed the consequences of changing the levels of MAP4K3 expression in the development of the Drosophila wing, a convenient model system to characterize gene function during epithelial development.
    

    
  


        Methodology and principal findings:
      
    

    
      Using loss-of-function mutants and over-expression conditions we find that MAP4K3 activity affects cell growth and viability in the Drosophila wing. These requirements are related to the modulation of the TORC1 and JNK signalling pathways, and are best detected when the larvae grow in a medium with low protein concentration (TORC1) or are exposed to irradiation (JNK). We also show that MAP4K3 display strong genetic interactions with different components of the InR/Tor signalling pathway, and can interact directly with the GTPases RagA and RagC and with the multi-domain kinase Tor.
    

    
  


        Conclusions and significance:
      
    

    
      We suggest that MAP4K3 has two independent functions during wing development, one related to the activation of the JNK pathway in response to stress and other in the assembling or activation of the TORC1 complex, being critical to modulate cellular responses to changes in nutrient availability.",2011,"MartÃ­n Resnik-Docampo, Jose F de Celis, MartÃ­n Resnik-Docampo, Jose F de Celis"
Comprehensive analysis of the chromatin landscape in Drosophila melanogaster,21179089,10.1038/nature09725,"Chromatin is composed of DNA and a variety of modified histones and non-histone proteins, which have an impact on cell differentiation, gene regulation and other key cellular processes.

Integrative analysis with other data (non-histone chromatin proteins, DNase I hypersensitivity, GRO-Seq reads produced by engaged polymerase, short/long RNA products) reveals discrete characteristics of chromosomes, genes, regulatory elements and other functional domains. We find that active genes display distinct chromatin signatures that are correlated with disparate gene lengths, exon patterns, regulatory functions and genomic contexts.

These factors are mapped at 50-bp resolution genome-wide and at 5-bp resolution for regulatory sequences of genes, which reveals fundamental features of chromatin modification landscape shared by major adult Drosophila cell types: the enrichment of both heterochromatic and euchromatic marks in transposons and repetitive sequences, the accumulation of HP1a at transcription start sites with stalled polII, the signatures of histone code and polII level/position around the transcriptional start sites that predict both the mRNA level and functionality of genes, and the enrichment of elongating polII within exons at splicing junctions.

"Genotoxicity and apoptosis in Drosophila melanogaster exposed to benzene, toluene and xylene: attenuation by quercetin and curcumin",21420423,10.1016/j.taap.2011.03.006,"Monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) such as benzene, toluene and xylene are being extensively used for various industrial and household purposes. Exposure to these hydrocarbons, occupationally or non-occupationally, is harmful to organisms including human. Several studies tested for toxicity of benzene, toluene and xylene, and interestingly, only a few studies looked into the attenuation. We used Drosophila model to test the genotoxic and apoptotic potential of these compounds and subsequently evaluated the efficiency of two phytochemicals, namely, quercetin and curcumin in attenuating test chemical induced toxicity. We exposed third instar larvae of wild type Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon R+) to 1.0-100.0 mM benzene, toluene or xylene, individually, for 12, 24 and 48 h and examined their apoptotic and genotoxic potential. We observed significantly (P<0.001) increased apoptotic markers and genotoxicity in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in organisms exposed to benzene, toluene or xylene.

Interactions between detoxification mechanisms and excretion in Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster,21228205,10.1242/jeb.048884,"Insects have long been known to excrete toxins via the Malpighian (renal) tubules. In addition, exposure to natural or synthetic toxins is commonly associated with increases in the activity of detoxification enzymes such as the P450 monoxygenases (P450s) and the glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs). We examined the links between mechanisms for detoxification and excretion in adult Drosophila melanogaster using functional assays and measurements of changes in gene expression by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR in response to dietary exposure to compounds known to alter activity or gene expression of P450s and GSTs. Dietary exposure to phenol, which alters gene expression for multiple GSTs after seven to 10 generations, was also associated with an increase (more than twofold) in secretion of the organic anion methotrexate (MTX) by isolated tubules. Dietary exposure to the insecticide synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) was associated with reduced expression of two P450 genes (Cyp4e2, Cyp4p1) and two GST genes (GstD1, GstD5) in the tubules, as well as increased expression of Cyp12d1 and GstE1. Thin layer chromatographic analysis of fluid secreted by isolated tubules indicated that dietary exposure to PBO resulted in increased levels of an MTX metabolite. In addition, exposure to PBO altered the expression of transporter genes in the tubules, including a Drosophila multidrug resistance-associated protein, and was associated with a 73% increase in MTX secretion by isolated tubules. The results suggest that exposure of Drosophila to toxins evokes a coordinated response by the Malpighian tubules, involving both alterations in detoxification pathways as well as enhanced transport.",2011,"Sarah Chahine, Michael J O'Donnell, Sarah Chahine, Michael J O'Donnell"
Determinants of synonymous and nonsynonymous variability in three species of Drosophila,21191087,10.1093/molbev/msq354,"We estimated the intensity of selection on preferred codons in Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. miranda at X-linked and autosomal loci, using a published data set on sequence variability at 67 loci, by means of an improved method that takes account of demographic effects. We found evidence for stronger selection at X-linked loci, consistent with their higher levels of codon usage bias. The estimates of the strength of selection and mutational bias in favor of unpreferred codons were similar to those found in other species, after taking into account the fact that D. pseudoobscura showed evidence for a recent expansion in population size. We examined correlates of synonymous and nonsynonymous diversity in these species and found no evidence for effects of recurrent selective sweeps on nonsynonymous mutations, which is probably because this set of genes have much higher than average levels of selective constraints. There was evidence for correlated effects of levels of selective constraints on protein sequences and on codon usage, as expected under models of selection for translational accuracy. Our analysis of a published data set on D. melanogaster provided evidence for the effects of selective sweeps of nonsynonymous mutations on linked synonymous diversity, but only in the subset of loci that experienced the highest rates of nonsynonymous substitutions (about one-quarter of the total) and not at more slowly evolving loci. Our correlational analysis of this data set suggested that both selective constraints on protein sequences and recurrent selective sweeps affect the overall level of codon usage.",2011,"Penelope R Haddrill, Kai Zeng, Brian Charlesworth, Penelope R Haddrill, Kai Zeng, Brian Charlesworth"

The intricate machinery required to establish and maintain divergent cell fates within a syncytium, and the importance of associated oocyte patterning for subsequent embryonic development, have made polarized cysts valuable subjects of study in developmental and cell biology. Nurse cell/oocyte specification is best understood in insects, particularly Drosophila melanogaster. However, polarized cysts have evolved independently in several other animal phyla. We describe the differentiation of female cystocytes in an annelid worm, the polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica. These worms are remarkable for their elegantly simple cysts, which comprise a single oocyte and nurse cell, making them an appealing complement to insects as subjects of study. To elucidate the process of cystocyte differentiation in O. labronica, we have constructed digital 3D models from electron micrographs of serially sectioned ovarian tissue. These models show that 2-cell cysts arise by fragmentation of larger ""parental"" cysts, rather than as independent units. The parental cysts vary in size and organization, are produced by asynchronous, indeterminate mitotic divisions of progenitor cystoblasts, and lack fusome-like organizing organelles. All of these characteristics represent key cytological differences from ""typical"" cyst development in insects like D. melanogaster.

A Genetic Screen for Dominant Enhancers of the Cell-Cycle Regulator Î±-Endosulfine Identifies Matrimony as a Strong Functional Interactor in Drosophila,22384372,10.1534/g3.111.001438,"The coordination of cell-cycle events with developmental processes is essential for the reproductive success of organisms. In Drosophila melanogaster, meiosis is tightly coupled to oocyte development, and early embryos undergo specialized S-M mitoses that are supported by maternal products. We previously showed that the small phosphoprotein Î±-endosulfine (Endos) is required for normal oocyte meiotic maturation and early embryonic mitoses in Drosophila. In this study, we performed a genetic screen for dominant enhancers of endos(00003) and identified several genomic regions that, when deleted, lead to impaired fertility of endos(00003)/+ heterozygous females. We uncovered matrimony (mtrm), which encodes a Polo kinase inhibitor, as a strong dominant enhancer of endos. mtrm(126) +/+ endos(00003) females are sterile because of defects in early embryonic mitoses, and this phenotype is reverted by removal of one copy of polo. These results provide compelling genetic evidence that excessive Polo activity underlies the strong functional interaction between endos(00003) and mtrm(126). Moreover, we show that endos is required for the increased expression of Mtrm in mature oocytes, which is presumably loaded into early embryos. These data are consistent with the model that maternal endos antagonizes Polo function in the early embryo to ensure normal mitoses through its effects on Mtrm expression during late oogenesis. Finally, we also identified genomic deletions that lead to loss of viability of endos(00003)/+ heterozygotes, consistent with recently published studies showing that endos is required zygotically to regulate the cell cycle during development.",2011,"Jessica R Von Stetina, Kimberly S Lafever, Mayer Rubin, Daniela Drummond-Barbosa, Jessica R Von Stetina, Kimberly S Lafever, Mayer Rubin, Daniela Drummond-Barbosa"

Structural analyses and alignment of the Daphnia proteins with their Drosophila counterparts revealed extensive sequence conservation, particularly in functional domains. Comparisons of the Daphnia proteins with other sequences showed that they are, in most cases, more similar to homologs from other species, including vertebrates, than they are to those of Drosophila.

Drosophila melanogaster flies produce a pheromonal bouquet with many cuticular hydrocarbons some of which diverge between the sexes and differently affect male courtship behavior. Cuticular pheromones have a relatively high weight and are thought to be -- mostly but not only -- detected by gustatory contact. However, the response of the peripheral and central gustatory systems to these substances remains poorly explored. We measured the effect induced by pheromonal cuticular mixtures on (i) the electrophysiological response of peripheral gustatory receptor neurons, (ii) the calcium variation in brain centers receiving these gustatory inputs and (iii) the behavioral reaction induced in control males and in mutant desat1 males, which show abnormal pheromone production and perception. While male and female pheromones induced inhibitory-like effects on taste receptor neurons, the contact of male pheromones on male fore-tarsi elicits a long-lasting response of higher intensity in the dedicated gustatory brain center. We found that the behavior of control males was more strongly inhibited by male pheromones than by female pheromones, but this difference disappeared in anosmic males. Mutant desat1 males showed an increased sensitivity of their peripheral gustatory neurons to contact pheromones and a behavioral incapacity to discriminate sex pheromones.

SHY is intuitively appealing because it relates the homeostatic regulation of sleep to an important function (synaptic plasticity). SHY has also received important experimental support from recent studies in Drosophila melanogaster. There remain, however, a number of unanswered questions about SHY. What is the cellular mechanism governing SHY? How does it fit with what we know about plasticity mechanisms in the brain? In this review, I discuss the evidence and theory of SHY in the context of what is known about Hebbian and non-Hebbian synaptic plasticity. I conclude that while SHY remains an elegant idea, the underlying mechanisms are mysterious and its functional significance unknown.",2012,"Marcos Gabriel Frank, Marcos Gabriel Frank"
Avoidance of heat and attraction to optogenetically induced sugar sensation as operant behavior in adult Drosophila,22834571,10.3109/01677063.2012.700266,"Animals have to perform adequate behavioral actions dependent on internal states and environmental situations, and adjust their behavior according to positive or negative consequences. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represents a key model organism for the investigation of neuronal mechanisms underlying adaptive behavior. The authors are using a behavioral paradigm in which fruit flies attached to a manipulator can walk on a Styrofoam ball whose movements are recorded such that intended left or right turns of the flies can be registered and used to operantly control heat stimuli or optogenetic activation of distinct subsets of neurons. As proof of principle, the authors find that flies in this situation avoid heat stimuli but prefer optogenetic self-stimulation of sugar receptors. Using this setup it now should be possible to study the neuronal network underlying positive and negative value assessment of adult Drosophila in an operant setting.",2012,"Nidhi Nuwal, Patrick Stock, Jochen Hiemeyer, Benjamin Schmid, AndrÃ© Fiala, Erich Buchner, Nidhi Nuwal, Patrick Stock, Jochen Hiemeyer, Benjamin Schmid, AndrÃ© Fiala, Erich Buchner"
Genotoxic evaluation of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors by use of the somatic mutation and recombination test in Drosophila melanogaster,22750076,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2012.06.004,"This study evaluated different concentrations of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (citalopram and sertraline) for genotoxicity by use of the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster. Three-day-old larvae, trans-heterozygous for the multiple wing hairs (mwh) and flare (flrÂ³) genes were treated with these two compounds. Two recessive markers were located on the left arm of chromosome 3, i.e. 'multiple wing hairs' (mwh) in map position 0.3 and 'flare-3' (flrÂ³) at 38.8, while the centromere was located in position 47.7. SMART is based on the loss of heterozygosity, which may occur through various mechanisms, such as mitotic recombination, mutation, deletion, half-translocation, chromosome loss, and non-disjunction. Genetic changes occurring in somatic cells of the wing's imaginal discs, cause the formation of mutant clones on the wing blade. The results of this study show that citalopram had a genotoxic effect in the Drosophila SMART. Sertraline, however, did not show any genotoxic effect in balancer heterozygous wings. This study concluded that more information is needed to be certain regarding the mutagenic effects of sertraline.",2012,"Mehmet GÃ¼rbÃ¼zel, Elif Oral, Halit Kizilet, Zekai Halici, Mustafa Gulec, Mehmet GÃ¼rbÃ¼zel, Elif Oral, Halit Kizilet, Zekai Halici, Mustafa Gulec"

Larva growing on the diet with sucrose led to the mild oxidative stress development in adult insects, which was differently expressed in both sexes. In males mainly molecules of proteins were subjected to oxidative damages, whereas in females--lipid molecules. This is evidenced by 77% increased content of protein carbonyl groups and decreased (by 40%) level of protein SH-groups in males fed on sucrose. In females fed on sucrose the content of lipid peroxides was by 44% higher, than in individuals, hold on the diet with equimolar mixture of glucose and fructose. The oxidative stress in females was accompanied with increased activity of catalase, superoxide dismutase and thiredoxin reductase by 30, 15 and 34%, respectively.

The ovicidal, larvacidal and adulticidal effects of 5,5'-dimethyl -2, 2'-dipyridyl (termed Ha44), which is being developed as a treatment for head lice, were evaluated in the Drosophila melanogaster model system. Ha44 demonstrated significant activity against embryos and was capable of arresting development at a number of stages of embryogenesis. The effects of Ha44 on embryos was shown to be reversible following the addition of the metal ions Fe(II) and Fe(III), Cu and Zn. When larvae were exposed to Ha44, lethality was recorded at similar concentrations to those observed for embryos. Using an eYFP reporter system it was shown that Ha44 was able to reduce the levels of both copper and zinc in the digestive tract, confirming the binding of Ha44 to these metals in vivo. Ha44 has further been shown to inhibit a zinc containing metalloproteinase in vitro. Exposure of adult flies to Ha44 resulted in lethality, but at higher concentrations than those observed for embryos and larvae. The median lethal dose in adult flies was shown to be associated with the type of exposure, with an LD-50 of 1.57 mM being recorded following the direct contact of flies with Ha44, while an LD-50 of 12.29 mM was recorded following the ingestion of the compound.

In the first part of the study we sequenced nearly 3.6 kb of this gene in a northern Drosophila species (Drosophila montana) with a robust photoperiodically determined diapause and found several types of polymorphisms along the sequenced area. We also found variation among five Drosophila virilis group species in the length of the 5th exon of cpo and in the site of the stop codon at the end of this exon. The second part of the study was targeted on a deletion of six amino acids located in the last section of exon 5, which in D. melanogaster, is translated only in one short transcript lacking the following exons. The studied deletion appeared to be extremely rare in the wild D. montana population where it was found, but its frequency rapidly increased during laboratory culture. qPCR analyses showed the expression level of the deletion allele to be significantly downregulated in both the diapausing and non-diapausing females compared to the wild type allele. At the phenotypic level, the deletion and the decreased expression of cpo transcript involving it did not have direct effect on the incidence of female reproductive diapause, but it was associated with a reduction in development time under diapause-inducing conditions. This suggests that while the cpo transcript containing the prolonged version of the 5th exon with a stop codon is clearly associated with fly development time, the exons with RNA domains included in other transcripts of the gene may be more directly related to diapause regulation.",2012,"Maaria Kankare, Tiina S Salminen, Hanna Lampinen, Anneli Hoikkala, Maaria Kankare, Tiina S Salminen, Hanna Lampinen, Anneli Hoikkala"

Typically, Drosophila sleep displays a bimodal pattern, consisting of distinct daytime and nighttime components. Notably, daytime and nighttime sleep differ with respect to several qualities, such as sleep-bout lengths and arousal thresholds. In this short review, we describe several genetic and environmental factors that differentially affect daytime and nighttime sleep, highlighting the observations suggesting the notion that these temporally distinct components of Drosophila sleep may have unique biological functions and be regulated by different homeostatic regulatory mechanisms.",2012,"Hiroshi Ishimoto, Arianna Lark, Toshihiro Kitamoto, Hiroshi Ishimoto, Arianna Lark, Toshihiro Kitamoto"
Ectopic assembly of heterochromatin in Drosophila melanogaster triggered by transposable elements,22891327,10.1073/pnas.1207036109,"A persistent question in biology is how cis-acting sequence elements influence trans-acting factors and the local chromatin environment to modulate gene expression. We reported previously that the DNA transposon 1360 can enhance silencing of a reporter in a heterochromatic domain of Drosophila melanogaster. We have now generated a collection of variegating phiC31 landing-pad insertion lines containing 1360 and a heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70)-driven white reporter to explore the mechanism of 1360-sensitive silencing. Many 1360-sensitive sites were identified, some in apparently euchromatic domains, although all are close to heterochromatic masses. One such site (line 1198; insertion near the base of chromosome arm 2L) has been investigated in detail. ChIP analysis shows 1360-dependent Heterochromatin Protein 1a (HP1a) accumulation at this otherwise euchromatic site. The phiC31 landing pad system allows different 1360 constructs to be swapped with the full-length element at the same genomic site to identify the sequences that mediate 1360-sensitive silencing. Short deletions over sites with homology to PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are sufficient to compromise 1360-sensitive silencing. Similar results were obtained on replacing 1360 with Invader4 (a retrotransposon), suggesting that this phenomenon likely applies to a broader set of transposable elements. Our results suggest a model in which piRNA sequence elements behave as cis-acting targets for heterochromatin assembly, likely in the early embryo, where piRNA pathway components are abundant, with the heterochromatic state subsequently propagated by chromatin modifiers present in somatic tissue.",2012,"Monica F Sentmanat, Sarah C R Elgin, Monica F Sentmanat, Sarah C R Elgin"

We compared mating and nonmating individuals to test whether mating was nonrandom with respect to relatedness. Consistent with optimal inbreeding, males were more closely related to their mate than to randomly sampled females. However, all individuals collected mating showed higher relatedness and males were not significantly more related to their mate than to other mating females.

Defining protein-protein interactions in protein complexes, and establishing the when, what and where of potential interactions, is therefore crucial to understanding the cellular function of any protein-especially those that have not been well studied by traditional molecular genetic approaches.

Protein phosphorylation changes reveal new candidates in the regulation of egg activation and early embryogenesis in D. melanogaster,22884528,10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.07.024,"Egg activation is the series of events that must occur for a mature oocyte to become capable of supporting embryogenesis. These events include changes to the egg's outer coverings, the resumption and completion of meiosis, the translation of new proteins, and the degradation of specific maternal mRNAs. While we know some of the molecules that direct the initial events of egg activation, it remains unclear how multiple pathways are coordinated to change the cellular state from mature oocyte to activated egg. Using a proteomic approach we have identified new candidates for the regulation and progression of egg activation. Reasoning that phosphorylation can simultaneously and rapidly modulate the activity of many proteins, we identified proteins that are post-translationally modified during the transition from oocyte to activated egg in Drosophila melanogaster. We find that at least 311 proteins change in phosphorylation state between mature oocytes and activated eggs. These proteins fall into various functional classes related to the events of egg activation including calcium binding, proteolysis, and protein translation. Our set of candidates includes genes already associated with egg activation, as well as many genes not previously studied during this developmental period. RNAi knockdown of a subset of these genes revealed a new gene, mrityu, necessary for embryonic development past the first mitosis.

Characterization of genomic regulatory domains conserved across the genus Drosophila,23042552,10.1093/gbe/evs089,"In both vertebrates and insects, the conservation of local gene order among distantly related species (microsynteny) is higher than expected in the presence of highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs). Dense clusters of HCNEs, or HCNE peaks, have been proposed to mediate the regulation of sometimes distantly located genes, which are central for the developmental program of the organism. Thus, the regions encompassing HCNE peaks and their targets in different species would form genomic regulatory domains (GRDs), which should presumably enjoy an enhanced stability over evolutionary time. By leveraging genome rearrangement information from nine Drosophila species and using gene functional and phenotypic information, we performed a comprehensive characterization of the organization of microsynteny blocks harboring HCNE peaks and provide a functional portrait of the putative HCNE targets that reside therein. We found that Drosophila HCNE peaks tend to colocalize more often than expected and to be evenly distributed across chromosomal elements. Putative HCNE peak targets are characterized by a tight association with particular promoter motifs, higher incidence of severe mutant phenotypes, and evidence of a more precise regulation of gene expression during important developmental transitions. As for their physical organization, ~65% of these putative targets are separated by a median of two genes from their nearest HCNE peaks. These observations represent the first functional portrait of this euchromatic fraction of the Drosophila genome with distinctive evolutionary dynamics, which will facilitate future experimental studies on the interactions between HCNE peaks and their targets in a genetically tractable system such as Drosophila melanogaster.",2012,"Virginia Sahagun, JosÃ© M Ranz, Virginia Sahagun, JosÃ© M Ranz"
dSet1 is the main H3K4 di- and tri-methyltransferase throughout Drosophila development,22048023,10.1534/genetics.111.135863,"In eukaryotes, the post-translational addition of methyl groups to histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) plays key roles in maintenance and establishment of appropriate gene expression patterns and chromatin states. We report here that an essential locus within chromosome 3L centric heterochromatin encodes the previously uncharacterized Drosophila melanogaster ortholog (dSet1, CG40351) of the Set1 H3K4 histone methyltransferase (HMT). Our results suggest that dSet1 acts as a ""global"" or general H3K4 di- and trimethyl HMT in Drosophila. Levels of H3K4 di- and trimethylation are significantly reduced in dSet1 mutants during late larval and post-larval stages, but not in animals carrying mutations in genes encoding other well-characterized H3K4 HMTs such as trr, trx, and ash1. The latter results suggest that Trr, Trx, and Ash1 may play more specific roles in regulating key cellular targets and pathways and/or act as global H3K4 HMTs earlier in development. In yeast and mammalian cells, the HMT activity of Set1 proteins is mediated through an evolutionarily conserved protein complex known as Complex of Proteins Associated with Set1 (COMPASS). We present biochemical evidence that dSet1 interacts with members of a putative Drosophila COMPASS complex and genetic evidence that these members are functionally required for H3K4 methylation.

Rhodopsin 5- and Rhodopsin 6-mediated clock synchronization in Drosophila melanogaster is independent of retinal phospholipase C-Î² signaling,22306971,10.1177/0748730411431673,"Circadian clocks of most organisms are synchronized with the 24-hour solar day by the changes of light and dark. In Drosophila, both the visual photoreceptors in the compound eyes as well as the blue-light photoreceptor Cryptochrome expressed within the brain clock neurons contribute to this clock synchronization. A specialized photoreceptive structure located between the retina and the optic lobes, the Hofbauer-Buchner (H-B) eyelet, projects to the clock neurons in the brain and also participates in light synchronization. The compound eye photoreceptors and the H-B eyelet contain Rhodopsin photopigments, which activate the canonical invertebrate phototransduction cascade after being excited by light. We show here that 2 of the photopigments present in these photoreceptors, Rhodopsin 5 (Rh5) and Rhodopsin 6 (Rh6), contribute to light synchronization in a mutant (norpA(P41) ) that disrupts canonical phototransduction due to the absence of Phospholipase C-Î² (PLC-Î²). We reveal that norpA(P41) is a true loss-of-function allele, resulting in a truncated PLC-Î² protein that lacks the catalytic domain. Light reception mediated by Rh5 and Rh6 must therefore utilize either a different (nonretinal) PLC-Î² enzyme or alternative signaling mechanisms, at least in terms of clock-relevant photoreception.

Physiology declines prior to death in Drosophila melanogaster,22960750,10.1007/s10522-012-9398-z,"For a period of 6-15 days prior to death, the fecundity and virility of Drosophila melanogaster fall significantly below those of same-aged flies that are not near death.

Using individual fecundity estimates and previously described models, it is possible to accurately predict which flies in a population are near death at any given age; these flies are said to be in the ""death spiral"". In this study of approximately 7,600 females, we used cohort mortality data and individual fecundity estimates to dichotomize each of five replicate populations of same-aged D. melanogaster into ""death spiral"" and ""non-spiral"" groups. We then compared these groups for two physiological characteristics that decline during aging. We describe the statistical properties of a new multivariate test statistic that allows us to compare the desiccation resistance and time-in-motion for two populations chosen on the basis of their fecundity. This multivariate representation of the desiccation resistance and time-in-motion of spiral and non-spiral females was shown to be significantly different with the spiral females characterized by lower desiccation resistance and time spent in motion.

An independent set with flies not involved in initial cross-validation was then used to validate the accuracy of each calibration model. Flies from the independent sets were correctly classified into Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans with 94% and 82% accuracy, respectively, whereas flies were successfully classified by gender with accuracy greater than 90%. In the age grading test, correlation plots of the actual and predicted age for males and females of D. melanogaster and D. simulans were shown to be overlapping between the adjacent age groups.

Regulation of epithelial polarity by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Neuralized and the Bearded inhibitors in Drosophila,22504274,10.1038/ncb2481,"Understanding how epithelial polarity is established and regulated during tissue morphogenesis is a major issue.

This mechanism involves the inhibition of the conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase Neuralized by proteins of the Bearded family. First, Bearded mutant embryos exhibited a loss of epithelial polarity associated with an early loss of the apical domain. Bearded regulated epithelial polarity by antagonizing neuralized. Second, repression of Bearded gene expression by Snail was required for the Snail-dependent disassembly of adherens junctions in the mesoderm. Third, neuralized was strictly required to promote the downregulation of the apical domain in the midgut epithelium and to facilitate the transepithelial migration of primordial germ cells across this epithelium.

Plasticity and genotype ? environment interactions for locomotion in Drosophila melanogaster larvae,21818661,10.1007/s10519-011-9490-1,"Locomotion is a primary means by which animals interact with the world. To understand the contribution of genotype ? environment interactions to individual differences in D. melanogaster larval locomotion we investigated phenotypic sensitivity to environmental changes in four strains of this species and their F1 hybrids. We also investigated to what extent flexibility and plasticity of locomotion depend upon larval age. Specifically, we examined larval locomotion at 48 and 96 h of development on three different substrates. Locomotion was influenced by the structure of the substrate, but this depended on both the genotype and larval age. At 48 h of larval development phenotypic variation in locomotion was attributable to both genotype ? environment interactions and genotypic differences among the larvae, while at 96 h of age, differences were mainly due to genotype ? environment interactions. An analysis of variance of the 4 ? 4 diallel cross made at 48 and 96 h of development showed, depending on the cross, either dominance to increase/decrease locomotion, overdominance to increase/decrease locomotion, or no dominance to increase/decrease locomotion. Furthermore, the diversity of behavioral responses in the F1 hybrids was greater at 96 than at 48 h of larval development. Our results demonstrate that genotype ? environment interactions result in plasticity of D. melanogaster larval locomotion, which makes sense in light of the fact that larvae, in the wild, develop in heterogeneous and rapidly changing environments.",2012,"Francisco Del Pino, Erika Salgado, RaÃºl Godoy-Herrera, Francisco Del Pino, Erika Salgado, RaÃºl Godoy-Herrera"
Optical calcium imaging in the nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster,22402253,10.1016/j.bbagen.2012.02.013,"Background:
      
    

    
      Drosophila melanogaster is one of the best-studied model organisms in biology, mainly because of the versatility of methods by which heredity and specific expression of genes can be traced and manipulated. Sophisticated genetic tools have been developed to express transgenes in selected cell types, and these techniques can be utilized to target DNA-encoded fluorescence probes to genetically defined subsets of neurons. Neuroscientists make use of this approach to monitor the activity of restricted types or subsets of neurons in the brain and the peripheral nervous system. Since membrane depolarization is typically accompanied by an increase in intracellular calcium ions, calcium-sensitive fluorescence proteins provide favorable tools to monitor the spatio-temporal activity across groups of neurons.
    

    
  


        Scope of review:

For this purpose, RNAi was used to efficiently deplete dH1 in flies. Expression-profiling shows that dH1 depletion affects expression of a relatively small number of genes in a regional manner. Furthermore, depletion up-regulates inactive genes, preferentially those located in heterochromatin, while active euchromatic genes are down-regulated, suggesting that the contribution of dH1 to transcription regulation is mainly structural, organizing chromatin for proper gene-expression regulation. Up-regulated genes are remarkably enriched in transposons. In particular, R1/R2 retrotransposons, which specifically integrate in the rDNA locus, are strongly up-regulated. Actually, depletion increases expression of transposon-inserted rDNA copies, resulting in synthesis of aberrant rRNAs and enlarged nucleolus. Concomitantly, dH1-depleted cells accumulate extra-chromosomal rDNA, show increased Î³H2Av content, stop proliferation and activate apoptosis, indicating that depletion causes genome instability and affects proliferation. Finally, the contributions to maintenance of genome integrity and cell proliferation appear conserved in human hH1s, as their expression rescues proliferation of dH1-depleted cells.",2012,"Olivera Vujatovic, Katrin Zaragoza, Alejandro Vaquero, Oscar Reina, Jordi BernuÃ©s, Fernando AzorÃ­n, Olivera Vujatovic, Katrin Zaragoza, Alejandro Vaquero, Oscar Reina, Jordi BernuÃ©s, Fernando AzorÃ­n"
CoREST acts as a positive regulator of Notch signaling in the follicle cells of Drosophila melanogaster,22331351,10.1242/jcs.089797,"The Notch signaling pathway plays important roles in a variety of developmental events. The context-dependent activities of positive and negative modulators dramatically increase the diversity of cellular responses to Notch signaling. In a screen for mutations affecting the Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium, we isolated a mutation in CoREST that disrupts the Notch-dependent mitotic-to-endocycle switch of follicle cells at stage 6 of oogenesis. We show that Drosophila CoREST positively regulates Notch signaling, acting downstream of the proteolytic cleavage of Notch but upstream of Hindsight activity; the Hindsight gene is a Notch target that coordinates responses in the follicle cells. We show that CoREST genetically interacts with components of the Notch repressor complex, Hairless, C-terminal Binding Protein and Groucho. In addition, we demonstrate that levels of H3K27me3 and H4K16 acetylation are dramatically increased in CoREST mutant follicle cells. Our data indicate that CoREST acts as a positive modulator of the Notch pathway in the follicular epithelium as well as in wing tissue, and suggests a previously unidentified role for CoREST in the regulation of Notch signaling. Given its high degree of conservation among species, CoREST probably also functions as a regulator of Notch-dependent cellular events in other organisms.",2012,"Elena Domanitskaya, Trudi SchÃ¼pbach, Elena Domanitskaya, Trudi SchÃ¼pbach"
Attraction of Drosophila melanogaster males to food-related and fly odours,22067291,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.10.009,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has become a model for olfaction and odour-mediated behaviour. In the wild, Drosophila flies aggregate on decaying fruit where they mate and oviposit and a strategy to find mates would be to locate fruit which has already been colonized by other flies. We therefore developed a bioassay to investigate attraction of males to food and fly odours. We showed that upwind flights are initiated by food odours. At shorter distances, males are attracted by volatiles produced by conspecifics. However, only odours produced by copulating flies attract males. This suggests either a synergistic effect of both male and female odours or changes in pheromone release during mating, that indicate the presence of sexually receptive females. Our findings demonstrate the essential role of food odours and pheromones for mate location in D. melanogaster.",2012,"SÃ©bastien Lebreton, Paul G Becher, Bill S Hansson, Peter Witzgall"
"High hemocyte load is associated with increased resistance against parasitoids in Drosophila suzukii, a relative of D. melanogaster",22529929,10.1371/journal.pone.0034721,"Among the most common parasites of Drosophila in nature are parasitoid wasps, which lay their eggs in fly larvae and pupae. D. melanogaster larvae can mount a cellular immune response against wasp eggs, but female wasps inject venom along with their eggs to block this immune response. Genetic variation in flies for immune resistance against wasps and genetic variation in wasps for virulence against flies largely determines the outcome of any fly-wasp interaction. Interestingly, up to 90% of the variation in fly resistance against wasp parasitism has been linked to a very simple mechanism: flies with increased constitutive blood cell (hemocyte) production are more resistant. However, this relationship has not been tested for Drosophila hosts outside of the melanogaster subgroup, nor has it been tested across a diversity of parasitoid wasp species and strains. We compared hemocyte levels in two fly species from different subgroups, D. melanogaster and D. suzukii, and found that D. suzukii constitutively produces up to five times more hemocytes than D. melanogaster. Using a panel of 24 parasitoid wasp strains representing fifteen species, four families, and multiple virulence strategies, we found that D. suzukii was significantly more resistant to wasp parasitism than D. melanogaster. Thus, our data suggest that the relationship between hemocyte production and wasp resistance is general. However, at least one sympatric wasp species was a highly successful infector of D. suzukii, suggesting specialists can overcome the general resistance afforded to hosts by excessive hemocyte production. Given that D. suzukii is an emerging agricultural pest, identification of the few parasitoid wasps that successfully infect D. suzukii may have value for biocontrol.",2012,"Balint Z Kacsoh, Todd A Schlenke, Balint Z Kacsoh, Todd A Schlenke"
Nuclear genomic control of naturally occurring variation in mitochondrial function in Drosophila melanogaster,23171078,10.1186/1471-2164-13-659,"Background:
      
    

    
      Mitochondria are organelles found in nearly all eukaryotic cells that play a crucial role in cellular survival and function. Mitochondrial function is under the control of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. While the latter has been the focus of most genetic research, we remain largely ignorant about the nuclear-encoded genomic control of inter-individual variability in mitochondrial function. Here, we used Drosophila melanogaster as our model organism to address this question.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We quantified mitochondrial state 3 and state 4 respiration rates and P:O ratio in mitochondria isolated from the thoraces of 40 sequenced inbred lines of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel. We found significant within-population genetic variability for all mitochondrial traits. Hence, we performed genome-wide association mapping and identified 141 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with differences in mitochondrial respiration and efficiency (P ?? ? 10-5). Gene-centered regression models showed that 2-3 SNPs can explain 31, 13, and 18% of the phenotypic variation in state 3, state 4, and P:O ratio, respectively. Most of the genes tagged by the SNPs are involved in organ development, second messenger-mediated signaling pathways, and cytoskeleton remodeling. One of these genes, sallimus (sls), encodes a component of the muscle sarcomere. We confirmed the direct effect of sls on mitochondrial respiration using two viable mutants and their coisogenic wild-type strain. Furthermore, correlation network analysis revealed that sls functions as a transcriptional hub in a co-regulated module associated with mitochondrial respiration and is connected to CG7834, which is predicted to encode a protein with mitochondrial electron transfer flavoprotein activity. This latter finding was also verified in the sls mutants.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our results provide novel insights into the genetic factors regulating natural variation in mitochondrial function in D. melanogaster. The integrative genomic approach used in our study allowed us to identify sls as a novel hub gene responsible for the regulation of mitochondrial respiration in muscle sarcomere and to provide evidence that sls might act via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex.",2012,"Patricia Jumbo-Lucioni, Su Bu, Susan T Harbison, Juanita C Slaughter, Trudy F C Mackay, Douglas R Moellering, Maria De Luca, Patricia Jumbo-Lucioni, Su Bu, Susan T Harbison, Juanita C Slaughter, Trudy F C Mackay, Douglas R Moellering, Maria De Luca"
Identifying behavioral circuits in Drosophila melanogaster: moving targets in a flying insect,22285110,10.1016/j.conb.2012.01.002,"Drosophila melanogaster has historically been the premier model system for understanding the molecular and genetic bases of complex behaviors. In the last decade technical advances, in the form of new genetic tools and electrophysiological and optical methods, have allowed investigators to begin to dissect the neuronal circuits that generate behavior in the adult. The blossoming of circuit analysis in this organism has also reinforced our appreciation of the inadequacy of wiring diagrams for specifying complex behavior. Neuromodulation and neuronal plasticity act to reconfigure circuits on both short and long time scales. These processes act on the connectome, providing context by integrating external and internal cues that are relevant for behavioral choices. New approaches in the fly are providing insight into these basic principles of circuit function.",2012,"Leslie C Griffith, Leslie C Griffith"
Drosophila regulate yeast density and increase yeast community similarity in a natural substrate,22860093,10.1371/journal.pone.0042238,"Drosophila melanogaster adults and larvae, but especially larvae, had profound effects on the densities and community structure of yeasts that developed in banana fruits. Pieces of fruit exposed to adult female flies previously fed fly-conditioned bananas developed higher yeast densities than pieces of the same fruits that were not exposed to flies, supporting previous suggestions that adult Drosophila vector yeasts to new substrates. However, larvae alone had dramatic effects on yeast density and species composition. When yeast densities were compared in pieces of the same fruits assigned to different treatments, fruits that developed low yeast densities in the absence of flies developed significantly higher yeast densities when exposed to larvae. Across all of the fruits, larvae regulated yeast densities within narrow limits, as compared to a much wider range of yeast densities that developed in pieces of the same fruits not exposed to flies. Larvae also affected yeast species composition, dramatically reducing species diversity across fruits, reducing variation in yeast communities from one fruit to the next (beta diversity), and encouraging the consistent development of a yeast community composed of three species of yeast (Candida californica, C. zemplinina, and Pichia kluvyeri), all of which were palatable to larvae. Larvae excreted viable cells of these three yeast species in their fecal pools, and discouraged the growth of filamentous fungi, processes which may have contributed to their effects on the yeast communities in banana fruits. These and other findings suggest that D. melanogaster adults and their larval offspring together engage in 'niche construction', facilitating a predictable microbial environment in the fruit substrates in which the larvae live and develop.",2012,"Judy A Stamps, Louie H Yang, Vanessa M Morales, Kyria L Boundy-Mills, Judy A Stamps, Louie H Yang, Vanessa M Morales, Kyria L Boundy-Mills"
Drosophila melanogaster prophenoloxidases respond inconsistently to Cu2+ and have different activity in vitro,22178920,10.1016/j.dci.2011.12.001,"Dipteran insects, like mosquitoes, possess more than two prophenoloxidase (PPO) genes, but it is unclear whether their gene products differ in biochemical properties and physiological functions. Here, we used three Drosophila melanogaster PPOs as models to study their properties through expression in S2 cells. Our data revealed that the PPOs were expressed in the ethanol-activatable conformation: rPPO1 and rPPO2 needed additional Cu(2+) in the medium, but rPPO3 did not. rPPO1 bound Cu(2+) within minutes; rPPO2 did that in hours when Cu(2+) were present at a higher concentration. Thus, rPPO1 and rPPO2 were expressed as apo-rPPO and became holo-PPO upon Cu(2+) binding; rPPO3 was holo-PPO immediately after expression. Surprisingly, in the absence of ethanol, the apparently intact rPPO3 catalyzed dopamine oxidation and melanization. The successful method for rPPO expression in S2 cells described in this paper will provide us with an opportunity to study the properties of a specific PPO gene in a small insect like mosquitoes in the future.",2012,"Fei Liu, Yang Chen, Bing Yang, Jingfang Wang, Qin Peng, Qimiao Shao, Xuan Li, Brenda T Beerntsen, Yechun Xu, Jianyong Li, Xiao-Qiang Yu, Erjun Ling, Fei Liu, Yang Chen, Bing Yang, Jingfang Wang, Qin Peng, Qimiao Shao, Xuan Li, Brenda T Beerntsen, Yechun Xu, Jianyong Li, Xiao-Qiang Yu, Erjun Ling"
Effects of genetic knock-down of organic anion transporter genes on secretion of fluorescent organic ions by Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster,22972675,10.1002/arch.21066,"An earlier study has shown that RNAi knock-down of a single organic anion transporter (OAT) gene in the principal cells of Drosophila Malpighian tubules is associated with reductions in the expression of multiple, functionally related genes. In this study, we measured the rates of secretion of four fluorescent ions by tubules isolated from flies expressing targeted RNAi knock-down of specific OAT genes. Droplets secreted by isolated tubules set up in the Ramsay assay were collected in optically flat capillary tubes and the concentrations of fluorescent ions were determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Reductions in the expression of organic anion (OA) transporting polypeptide 58Dc (OATP; CG3380) were associated with reduced secretion of the OAs fluorescein and Texas Red. Reduction in the expression of Drosophila multidrug resistance associated protein (dMRP; CG6214) was correlated with reduced secretion of the P-glycoprotein substrate daunorubicin. Secretion of the organic cation quinacrine was unaffected by reduced expression of OATP, dMRP, or a multidrug efflux transporter (MET; CG30344).

In the first part of the study, we monitored the entrained and free-running locomotor activity rhythms of females in different light-dark and temperature regimes. These studies showed that D. montana flies completely lack the morning activity component typical to more southern Drosophila species in an entrained environment and that they are able to maintain their free-running locomotor activity rhythm better in constant light than in constant darkness. In the second part of the study, we traced the expression of the PDF neuropeptide and the CRY protein in the neurons of the brain in D. montana adults and found differences in the number and location of PDF- and CRY-expressing neurons compared with those described in Drosophila melanogaster.

The initial sequencing of the Drosophila melanogaster genome has served as a scaffold to study the transcriptional profile of an animal, revealing the complexities of the function and biogenesis of regulatory RNAs. The comparative analysis of 12 Drosophila genomes has been crucial for the study of microRNA evolution.

Hierarchical deployment of factors regulating temporal fate in a diverse neuronal lineage of the Drosophila central brain,22365543,10.1016/j.neuron.2011.12.018,"The anterodorsal projection neuron lineage of Drosophila melanogaster produces 40 neuronal types in a stereotypic order.

Kr mutation affects the temporal fate of the neuroblast (NB) itself, causing a single fate to be skipped, whereas Chinmo null only elicits fate transformation of NB progeny without altering cell counts. Notably, Chinmo operates in two separate windows to prevent fate transformation (into the subsequent Chinmo-indenpendent fate) within each window. By contrast, Hb/Pdm/Cas play no detectable role, indicating that Kr either acts outside of the cascade identified in the ventral nerve cord or that redundancy exists at the level of fating factors.

Effect of microwave exposure on the ovarian development of Drosophila melanogaster,22367734,10.1007/s12013-012-9347-0,"In the present experiments the effect of GSM radiation on ovarian development of virgin Drosophila melanogaster female insects was studied. Newly emerged adult female flies were collected and divided into separate identical groups. After the a lapse of certain number of hours-different for each group-the insects (exposed and sham-exposed) were dissected and their intact ovaries were collected and photographed under an optical microscope with the same magnification. The size of the ovaries was compared between exposed and sham-exposed virgin female insects, during the time needed for the completion of oogenesis and maturation of the first eggs in the ovarioles. Immediately after the intact ovaries were photographed, they were further dissected into individual ovarioles and treated for TUNEL and acridine-orange assays to determine the degree of DNA damage in the egg chamber cells. The study showed that the ovarian size of the exposed insects is significantly smaller than that of the corresponding sham-exposed insects, due to destruction of egg chambers by the GSM radiation, after DNA damage and consequent cell death induction in the egg chamber cells of the virgin females as shown in previous experiments on inseminated females. The difference in ovarian size between sham-exposed and exposed virgin female flies becomes most evident 39-45 h after eclosion when the first eggs within the ovaries are at the late vitellogenic and post-vitellogenic stages (mid-late oogenesis).

We used two different inducers that produced different levels of tau expression. The expression of these forms of tau did not significantly affect the lifespan of the flies. Flies expressing PH-tau displayed a clear locomotor dysfunction compared to those expressing normal tau regardless of the level of expression. At lower level of expression, this pathological phenotype was found to be age-dependent. At 35 days old, PH-tau flies showed the strongest locomotor impairment compare to flies expressing human tau or control flies (46%, 18% and 18% of flies remained on the bottom of the vials, respectively). At higher levels of expression, PH-tau flies showed these defects at seven days of age and the dysfunction also became significant for flies expressing tauR406W and PH-tauR406W. Whole brain immunochemistry analysis revealed that PH-tau as well as PH-tauR406W appeared to have abnormal mushroom body structures, critical structures involved in olfactory learning and memory in Drosophila. Severe olfactory learning deficits were induced by the expression of PH-tau.

The insulin receptor cellular IRES confers resistance to eIF4A inhibition,23878722,10.7554/eLife.00542,"Under conditions of stress, such as limited growth factor signaling, translation is inhibited by the action of 4E-BP and PDCD4. These proteins, through inhibition of eIF4E and eIF4A, respectively, impair cap-dependent translation. Under stress conditions FOXO transcription factors activate 4E-BP expression amplifying the repression. Here we show that Drosophila FOXO binds the PDCD4 promoter and stimulates the transcription of PDCD4 in response to stress. We have shown previously that the 5' UTR of the Drosophila insulin-like receptor (dINR) supports cap-independent translation that is resistant to 4E-BP. Using hippuristanol, an eIF4A inhibitor, we find that translation of dINR UTR containing transcripts are also resistant to eIF4A inhibition. In addition, the murine insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor receptor 5' UTRs support cap-independent translation and have a similar resistance to hippuristanol. This resistance to inhibition of eIF4E and eIF4A indicates a conserved strategy to allow translation of growth factor receptors under stress conditions.

Evolution of three parent genes and their retrogene copies in Drosophila species,23841016,10.1155/2013/693085,"Retrogenes form a class of gene duplicate lacking the regulatory sequences found outside of the mRNA-coding regions of the parent gene.

We investigated the embryonic expression patterns of these gene pairs across multiple Drosophila species. Expression patterns of the parent genes and their single copy orthologs are relatively conserved across species, whether or not a species has a retrogene copy, although there is some variation in CG8331 and CG17734. In contrast, expression patterns of the retrogene orthologs have diversified. We used the genome sequences of 20 Drosophila species to investigate coding sequence evolution. The coding sequences of the three gene pairs appear to be evolving predominantly under negative selection; however, the parent genes and retrogenes show some distinct differences in amino acid sequence. Therefore, in general, retrogene expression patterns and coding sequences are distinct compared to their parents and, in some cases, retrogene expression patterns diversify.",2013,"Ryan S O'Neill, Denise V Clark, Ryan S O'Neill, Denise V Clark"
Optimized position weight matrices in prediction of novel putative binding sites for transcription factors in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,23936309,10.1371/journal.pone.0068712,"Position weight matrices (PWMs) have become a tool of choice for the identification of transcription factor binding sites in DNA sequences. DNA-binding proteins often show degeneracy in their binding requirement and thus the overall binding specificity of many proteins is unknown and remains an active area of research. Although existing PWMs are more reliable predictors than consensus string matching, they generally result in a high number of false positive hits. Our previous study introduced a promising approach to PWM refinement in which known motifs are used to computationally mine putative binding sites directly from aligned promoter regions using composition of similar sites. In the present study, we extended this technique originally tested on single examples of transcription factors (TFs) and showed its capability to optimize PWM performance to predict new binding sites in the fruit fly genome. We propose refined PWMs in mono- and dinucleotide versions similarly computed for a large variety of transcription factors of Drosophila melanogaster. Along with the addition of many auxiliary sites the optimization includes variation of the PWM motif length, the binding sites location on the promoters and the PWM score threshold. To assess the predictive performance of the refined PWMs we compared them to conventional TRANSFAC and JASPAR sources. The results have been verified using performed tests and literature review.

Three pooling functions including max pooling, average pooling and Sqrt (square root of mean squared statistics) pooling are employed to transform the sparse codes to image features. Based on the constructed features, we develop both an image-level scheme and a group-level scheme to tackle the key challenges in annotating Drosophila gene expression pattern images automatically. To deal with the imbalanced data distribution inherent in image annotation tasks, the undersampling method is applied together with majority vote. Results on Drosophila embryonic expression pattern images verify the efficacy of our approach.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      In our experiment, the three pooling functions perform comparably well in feature dimension reduction. The undersampling with majority vote is shown to be effective in tackling the problem of imbalanced data. Moreover, combining sparse coding and image-level scheme leads to consistent performance improvement in keywords annotation.",2013,"Qian Sun, Sherin Muckatira, Lei Yuan, Shuiwang Ji, Stuart Newfeld, Sudhir Kumar, Jieping Ye, Qian Sun, Sherin Muckatira, Lei Yuan, Shuiwang Ji, Stuart Newfeld, Sudhir Kumar, Jieping Ye"
Adaptive divergence of a transcriptional enhancer between populations of Drosophila melanogaster,24218636,10.1098/rstb.2013.0024,"As species colonize new habitats they must adapt to the local environment. Much of this adaptation is thought to occur at the regulatory level; however, the relationships among genetic polymorphism, expression variation and adaptation are poorly understood. Drosophila melanogaster, which expanded from an ancestral range in sub-Saharan Africa around 15 000 years ago, represents an excellent model system for studying regulatory evolution. Here, we focus on the gene CG9509, which differs in expression between an African and a European population of D. melanogaster. The expression difference is caused by variation within a transcriptional enhancer adjacent to the CG9509 coding sequence. Patterns of sequence variation indicate that this enhancer was the target of recent positive selection, suggesting that the expression difference is adaptive. Analysis of the CG9509 enhancer in new population samples from Europe, Asia, northern Africa and sub-Saharan Africa revealed that sequence polymorphism is greatly reduced outside the ancestral range. A derived haplotype absent in sub-Saharan Africa is at high frequency in all other populations. These observations are consistent with a selective sweep accompanying the range expansion of the species. The new data help identify the sequence changes responsible for the difference in enhancer activity.",2013,"Amanda Glaser-Schmitt, Ana CatalÃ¡n, John Parsch, Amanda Glaser-Schmitt, Ana CatalÃ¡n, John Parsch"
Mycobacterium marinum infection in Drosophila melanogaster for antimycobacterial activity assessment,23118147,10.1093/jac/dks425,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      The major advantages of Drosophila melanogaster are a well-characterized immune system and high degree of susceptibility to tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium marinum. The D. melanogaster-M. marinum infection model is gaining momentum as a screening tool because it is genetically amenable, low priced, rapid, technically convenient and ethically acceptable. In this context, the aim of this study was to develop a new, effective D. melanogaster-M. marinum in vivo efficacy model for antimycobacterial drug discovery.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      D. melanogaster were challenged with intra-abdominal injections of M. marinum and infected flies were fed with a fly medium containing isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, amikacin, dinitrobenzamide or ampicillin dissolved in DMSO at different concentrations (0, 100 and 500 mg/L). Bacterial dissemination in flies was monitored by fluorescence microscopy/cfu counts and a fly survival curve was plotted.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The D. melanogaster-M. marinum model allowed assessment of the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment not only with conventional drugs, but also with newly discovered antimycobacterial agents. Rifampicin, dinitrobenzamide, amikacin and isoniazid effectively extended the life span of infected flies and ethambutol showed slightly improved survival. However, M. marinum infection was not cured by ampicillin or pyrazinamide.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This D. melanogaster-M. marinum infection/curing methodology may be valuable in the rapid evaluation of the activity of new antimycobacterial agents in drug discovery.",2013,"Chun-Taek Oh, Cheol Moon, Tae Hyun Choi, Byoung Soo Kim, Jichan Jang"
Early manipulation of juvenile hormone has sexually dimorphic effects on mature adult behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,24012944,10.1016/j.yhbeh.2013.08.018,"Hormones are critical for the development, maturation, and maintenance of physiological systems; therefore, understanding their involvement during maturation of the brain is important for the elucidation of mechanisms by which adults become behaviorally competent. Changes in exogenous and endogenous factors encountered during sexual maturation can have long lasting effects in mature adults. In this study, we investigated the role of the gonadotropic hormone, juvenile hormone (JH), in the modulation of adult behaviors in Drosophila. Here we utilized methoprene (a synthetic JH analog) and precocene (a JH synthesis inhibitor) to manipulate levels of JH in sexually immature male and female Drosophila with or without decreased synthesis of neuronal dopamine (DA). Locomotion and courtship behavior were assayed once the animals had grown to sexual maturity. The results demonstrate a sexually dimorphic role for JH in the modulation of these centrally controlled behaviors in mature animals that is dependent on the age of the animals assayed, and present DA as a candidate neuronal factor that differentially interacts with JH depending on the sex of the animal. The data also suggest that JH modulates these behaviors through an indirect mechanism. Since gonadotropic hormones and DA interact in mammals to affect brain development and later function, our results suggest that this mechanism for the development of adult behavioral competence may be evolutionarily conserved.",2013,"Kathryn J Argue, Amber J Yun, Wendi S Neckameyer, Kathryn J Argue, Amber J Yun, Wendi S Neckameyer"
Upd3--an ancestor of the four-helix bundle cytokines,23707937,10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.04.107,"The unpaired-like protein 3 (Upd3) is one of the three cytokines of Drosophila melanogaster supposed to activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (Janus tyrosine kinases/signal transducer and activator of transcription). This activation occurs via the type-I cytokine receptor domeless, an orthologue of gp130, the common signal transducer of all four-helix bundle interleukin-6 (IL-6) type cytokines. Both receptors are known to exist as preformed dimers in the plasma membrane and initiate the acute-phase response. These facts indicate an evolutionary relation between vertebrate IL-6 and the Drosophila protein Upd3. Here we presented data which strengthen this notion. Upd3 was recombinantly expressed, a renaturation and purification protocol was established which allows to obtain high amounts of biological active protein.

Dietary cholesterol modulates pathogen blocking by Wolbachia,23825950,10.1371/journal.ppat.1003459,"The bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis protects its hosts from a range of pathogens by limiting their ability to form infections inside the insect. This ""pathogen blocking"" could be explained by innate immune priming by the symbiont, competition for host-derived resources between pathogens and Wolbachia, or the direct modification of the cell or cellular environment by Wolbachia. Recent comparative work in Drosophila and the mosquito Aedes aegypti has shown that an immune response is not required for pathogen blocking, implying that there must be an additional component to the mechanism. Here we have examined the involvement of cholesterol in pathogen blocking using a system of dietary manipulation in Drosophila melanogaster in combination with challenge by Drosophila C virus (DCV), a common fly pathogen. We observed that flies reared on cholesterol-enriched diets infected with the Wolbachia strains wMelPop and wMelCS exhibited reduced pathogen blocking, with viral-induced mortality occurring 2-5 days earlier than flies reared on Standard diet. This shift toward greater virulence in the presence of cholesterol also corresponded to higher viral copy numbers in the host. Interestingly, an increase in dietary cholesterol did not have an effect on Wolbachia density except in one case, but this did not directly affect the strength of pathogen blocking. Our results indicate that host cholesterol levels are involved with the ability of Wolbachia-infected flies to resist DCV infections, suggesting that cholesterol contributes to the underlying mechanism of pathogen blocking.",2013,"Eric P Caragata, Edwige RancÃ¨s, Lauren M Hedges, Alexander W Gofton, Karyn N Johnson, Scott L O'Neill, Elizabeth A McGraw, Eric P Caragata, Edwige RancÃ¨s, Lauren M Hedges, Alexander W Gofton, Karyn N Johnson, Scott L O'Neill, Elizabeth A McGraw"
Scavenger receptors mediate the role of SUMO and Ftz-f1 in Drosophila steroidogenesis,23637637,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003473,"SUMOylation participates in ecdysteroid biosynthesis at the onset of metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster. Silencing the Drosophila SUMO homologue smt3 in the prothoracic gland leads to reduced lipid content, low ecdysone titers, and a block in the larval-pupal transition. Here we show that the SR-BI family of Scavenger Receptors mediates SUMO functions. Reduced levels of Snmp1 compromise lipid uptake in the prothoracic gland. In addition, overexpression of Snmp1 is able to recover lipid droplet levels in the smt3 knockdown prothoracic gland cells. Snmp1 expression depends on Ftz-f1 (an NR5A-type orphan nuclear receptor), the expression of which, in turn, depends on SUMO. Furthermore, we show by in vitro and in vivo experiments that Ftz-f1 is SUMOylated. RNAi-mediated knockdown of ftz-f1 phenocopies that of smt3 at the larval to pupal transition, thus Ftz-f1 is an interesting candidate to mediate some of the functions of SUMO at the onset of metamorphosis. Additionally, we demonstrate that the role of SUMOylation, Ftz-f1, and the Scavenger Receptors in lipid capture and mobilization is conserved in other steroidogenic tissues such as the follicle cells of the ovary. smt3 knockdown, as well as ftz-f1 or Scavenger knockdown, depleted the lipid content of the follicle cells, which could be rescued by Snmp1 overexpression. Therefore, our data provide new insights into the regulation of metamorphosis via lipid homeostasis, showing that Drosophila Smt3, Ftz-f1, and SR-BIs are part of a general mechanism for uptake of lipids such as cholesterol, required during development in steroidogenic tissues.",2013,"Ana Talamillo, Leire Herboso, Lucia Pirone, Coralia PÃ©rez, Monika GonzÃ¡lez, Jonatan SÃ¡nchez, Ugo Mayor, Fernando Lopitz-Otsoa, Manuel S Rodriguez, James D Sutherland, Rosa Barrio, Ana Talamillo, Leire Herboso, Lucia Pirone, Coralia PÃ©rez, Monika GonzÃ¡lez, Jonatan SÃ¡nchez, Ugo Mayor, Fernando Lopitz-Otsoa, Manuel S Rodriguez, James D Sutherland, Rosa Barrio"
In vitro maturation of Drosophila melanogaster SpÃ¤tzle protein with refolded Easter reveals a novel cleavage site within the prodomain,23729565,10.1515/hsz-2013-0131,"Dorsoventral patterning during Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis is mediated by a well-defined gradient of the mature NGF-like ligand SpÃ¤tzle. Easter, the ultimate protease of a ventrally-restricted serine protease cascade, plays a key role in the regulation of the morphogenic gradient, catalyzing the activation cleavage of proSpÃ¤tzle. As a result of alternative splicing, proSpÃ¤tzle exists in multiple isoforms, almost all of which differ only in their prodomain. Although this domain is unstructured in isolation, it has a stabilizing influence on the mature cystine knot domain and is involved in the binding to the Toll receptor. Here, we report the expression and refolding of Easter, and show that the renatured enzyme performs the activation cleavage of two SpÃ¤tzle isoforms. We determine the affinity of the prodomain for the cystine knot domain, and show that Easter performs a previously unknown secondary cleavage in each prodomain.",2013,"Christian Ursel, Uwe Fandrich, Anita Hoffmann, Torsten Sieg, Christian Ihling, Milton T Stubbs, Christian Ursel, Uwe Fandrich, Anita Hoffmann, Torsten Sieg, Christian Ihling, Milton T Stubbs"
Spatial and temporal distribution of pathogenic Wolbachia strain wMelPop in Drosophila melanogaster central nervous system under different temperature conditions,23672808,10.1016/j.jip.2013.05.001,"The pathogenic Wolbachia strain, wMelPop, of Drosophila melanogaster is propagated in the fly's brain and muscles. To determine how wMelPop spreads in the host's central nervous system (CNS) during its life cycle, we used whole-mount fluorescent in situ hybridization to demonstrate the spatial distribution of wMelPop in D.melanogaster larvae and adults. To assess the effect of temperature on the pattern of wMelPop spread, we performed this analysis under moderate (25Â°C) and high (29Â°C) temperature conditions. Wolbachia distribution pattern in the third instar larva and adult brain was similar at both temperatures. wMelPop was generally localized to the subesophageal ganglion and the central brain of the host, whereas optic lobe anlagen cells of third instar larvae and cells of the optic lobe, lamina and retina of adult flies were mostly free of bacteria. Interestingly, high temperature had no significant effect on wMelPop titer or localization in the brain during larval development, but considerably altered it in adults immediately after eclosion. At both temperatures and within all tested stages of the life cycle, the bacterial titer varied only slightly between individuals. The observed differences in wMelPop titers in the central brain, subesophageal ganglion and optic lobe anlagen cells of third instar larva's CNS, together with the observation that these patterns are conserved in the adult brain, suggest that Wolbachia distribution is determined during fly embryogenesis.",2013,"Anton Strunov, Elena Kiseleva, Yuval Gottlieb, Anton Strunov, Elena Kiseleva, Yuval Gottlieb"
How to design a genetic mating scheme: a basic training package for Drosophila genetics,23390611,10.1534/g3.112.004820,"Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model organism for biological research. The essential and common instrument of fly research is genetics, the art of applying Mendelian rules in the specific context of Drosophila with its unique classical genetic tools and the breadth of modern genetic tools and strategies brought in by molecular biology, transgenic technologies and the use of recombinases. Training newcomers to fly genetics is a complex and time-consuming task but too important to be left to chance. Surprisingly, suitable training resources for beginners currently are not available. Here we provide a training package for basic Drosophila genetics, designed to ensure that basic knowledge on all key areas is covered while reducing the time invested by trainers. First, a manual introduces to fly history, rationale for mating schemes, fly handling, Mendelian rules in fly, markers and balancers, mating scheme design, and transgenic technologies. Its self-study is followed by a practical training session on gender and marker selection, introducing real flies under the dissecting microscope. Next, through self-study of a PowerPoint presentation, trainees are guided step-by-step through a mating scheme. Finally, to consolidate knowledge, trainees are asked to design similar mating schemes reflecting routine tasks in a fly laboratory. This exercise requires individual feedback but also provides unique opportunities for trainers to spot weaknesses and strengths of each trainee and take remedial action. This training package is being successfully applied at the Manchester fly facility and may serve as a model for further training resources covering other aspects of fly research.",2013,"John Roote, Andreas Prokop, John Roote, Andreas Prokop"
Novel whole-tissue quantitative assay of nitric oxide levels in Drosophila neuroinflammatory response,24335747,10.3791/50892,"Neuroinflammation is a complex innate immune response vital to the healthy function of the central nervous system (CNS). Under normal conditions, an intricate network of inducers, detectors, and activators rapidly responds to neuron damage, infection or other immune infractions. This inflammation of immune cells is intimately associated with the pathology of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease and ALS. Under compromised disease states, chronic inflammation, intended to minimize neuron damage, may lead to an over-excitation of the immune cells, ultimately resulting in the exacerbation of disease progression. For example, loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain, a hallmark of PD, is accelerated by the excessive activation of the inflammatory response. Though the cause of PD is largely unknown, exposure to environmental toxins has been implicated in the onset of sporadic cases. The herbicide paraquat, for example, has been shown to induce Parkinsonian-like pathology in several animal models, including Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we have used the conserved innate immune response in Drosophila to develop an assay capable of detecting varying levels of nitric oxide, a cell-signaling molecule critical to the activation of the inflammatory response cascade and targeted neuron death. Using paraquat-induced neuronal damage, we assess the impact of these immune insults on neuroinflammatory stimulation through the use of a novel, quantitative assay. Whole brains are fully extracted from flies either exposed to neurotoxins or of genotypes that elevate susceptibility to neurodegeneration then incubated in cell-culture media. Then, using the principles of the Griess reagent reaction, we are able to detect minor changes in the secretion of nitric oxide into cell-culture media, essentially creating a primary live-tissue model in a simple procedure. The utility of this model is amplified by the robust genetic and molecular complexity of Drosophila melanogaster, and this assay can be modified to be applicable to other Drosophila tissues or even other small, whole-organism inflammation models.",2013,"Rami R Ajjuri, Janis M O'Donnell, Rami R Ajjuri, Janis M O'Donnell"
Development of a Drosophila cell-based error correction assay,23888285,10.3389/fonc.2013.00187,"Accurate transmission of the genome through cell division requires microtubules from opposing spindle poles to interact with protein super-structures called kinetochores that assemble on each sister chromatid. Most kinetochores establish erroneous attachments that are destabilized through a process called error correction. Failure to correct improper kinetochore-microtubule (kt-MT) interactions before anaphase onset results in chromosomal instability (CIN), which has been implicated in tumorigenesis and tumor adaptation. Thus, it is important to characterize the molecular basis of error correction to better comprehend how CIN occurs and how it can be modulated. An error correction assay has been previously developed in cultured mammalian cells in which incorrect kt-MT attachments are created through the induction of monopolar spindle assembly via chemical inhibition of kinesin-5. Error correction is then monitored following inhibitor wash out. Implementing the error correction assay in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells would be valuable because kt-MT attachments are easily visualized and the cells are highly amenable to RNAi and high-throughput screening. However, Drosophila kinesin-5 (Klp61F) is unaffected by available small molecule inhibitors. To overcome this limitation, we have rendered S2 cells susceptible to kinesin-5 inhibitors by functionally replacing Klp61F with human kinesin-5 (Eg5). Eg5 expression rescued the assembly of monopolar spindles typically caused by Klp61F depletion. Eg5-mediated bipoles collapsed into monopoles due, in part, to kinesin-14 (Ncd) activity when treated with the kinesin-5 inhibitor S-trityl-L-cysteine (STLC). Furthermore, bipolar spindles reassembled and error correction was observed after STLC wash out. Importantly, error correction in Eg5-expressing S2 cells was dependent on the well-established error correction kinase Aurora B. This system provides a powerful new cell-based platform for studying error correction and CIN.",2013,"Jeffrey D Salemi, Philip T McGilvray, Thomas J Maresca, Jeffrey D Salemi, Philip T McGilvray, Thomas J Maresca"
Elevated expression of the integrin-associated protein PINCH suppresses the defects of Drosophila melanogaster muscle hypercontraction mutants,23555310,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003406,"A variety of human diseases arise from mutations that alter muscle contraction. Evolutionary conservation allows genetic studies in Drosophila melanogaster to be used to better understand these myopathies and suggest novel therapeutic strategies. Integrin-mediated adhesion is required to support muscle structure and function, and expression of Integrin adhesive complex (IAC) proteins is modulated to adapt to varying levels of mechanical stress within muscle. Mutations in flapwing (flw), a catalytic subunit of myosin phosphatase, result in non-muscle myosin hyperphosphorylation, as well as muscle hypercontraction, defects in size, motility, muscle attachment, and subsequent larval and pupal lethality. We find that moderately elevated expression of the IAC protein PINCH significantly rescues flw phenotypes. Rescue requires PINCH be bound to its partners, Integrin-linked kinase and Ras suppressor 1. Rescue is not achieved through dephosphorylation of non-muscle myosin, suggesting a mechanism in which elevated PINCH expression strengthens integrin adhesion. In support of this, elevated expression of PINCH rescues an independent muscle hypercontraction mutant in muscle myosin heavy chain, Mhc(Samba1). By testing a panel of IAC proteins, we show specificity for PINCH expression in the rescue of hypercontraction mutants. These data are consistent with a model in which PINCH is present in limiting quantities within IACs, with increasing PINCH expression reinforcing existing adhesions or allowing for the de novo assembly of new adhesion complexes. Moreover, in myopathies that exhibit hypercontraction, strategic PINCH expression may have therapeutic potential in preserving muscle structure and function.",2013,"Stephen M Pronovost, Mary C Beckerle, Julie L Kadrmas, Stephen M Pronovost, Mary C Beckerle, Julie L Kadrmas"

Sexual selection could act to eliminate deleterious alleles in concert with other forms of selection, thereby improving the fitness of sexual populations. Alternatively, the divergent reproductive strategies of the sexes could promote the maintenance of sexually antagonistic variation, causing sexual populations to be less fit. The net impact of sexual selection on fitness is not well understood, due in part to limited data on the sex-specific effects of spontaneous mutations on total fitness. Using a set of mutation accumulation lines of Drosophila melanogaster, we found that mutations were deleterious in both sexes and had larger effects on fitness in males than in females.

However, the regulation of EcR action is still unclear, especially in mammals and as far as posttranslational modifications are concerned. Up until now, there has been no study on EcR sumoylation. Using bioinformatic predictors, a Ubc9 fusion-directed sumoylation system and mutagenesis experiments, we present EcR as a new target of SUMO1 and SUMO3 modification. Our research revealed that EcR undergoes isoform-specific multisumoylation. The pattern of modification remains unchanged in the presence of the ligand and the dimerization partner. The SUMO acceptor sites are located in the DNA-binding domain and the ligand-binding domain that both exhibit structural plasticity. We also demonstrated the existence of a sumoylation site in the F region and EcRA-A/B region, both revealing characteristics of intrinsically disordered regions.

Apical localization and activity of Dia are at the core of restricting F-actin formation to the correct membrane domain. Here we identify the mechanisms that target Dia to the apical surface. PI(4,5)P2 levels at the apical membrane regulate Dia localization in both the MDCK cyst model and in Drosophila tubular epithelia. An N-terminal basic domain of Dia is crucial for apical localization, implying direct binding to PI(4,5)P2. Dia apical targeting also depends on binding to Rho1, which is critical for activation-induced conformational change, as well as physically anchoring Dia to the apical membrane. We demonstrate that binding to Rho1 facilitates interaction with PI(4,5)P2 at the plane of the membrane. Together these cues ensure efficient and distinct restriction of Dia to the apical membrane.

Adult wild-type flies were concomitantly exposed to rotenone (500 Î¼M) and V. officinalis aqueous extract (10mg/mL) in the food during 7 days. Rotenone-fed flies had a worse performance in the negative geotaxis assay (i.e. climbing capability) and open-field test (i.e. mobility time) as well as a higher incidence of mortality when compared to control group. V. officinalis treatment offered protection against these detrimental effects of rotenone. In contrast, the decreased number of crossings observed in the flies exposed to rotenone was not modified by V. officinalis. Rotenone toxicity was also associated with a marked decrease on the total-thiol content in the homogenates and cell viability of flies, which were reduced by V. officinalis treatment. Indeed, rotenone exposure caused a significant increase in the mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) and also in the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene. The expression of SOD and CAT mRNAs was normalized by V. officinalis treatment.

Toll-6 and Toll-7 are expressed in the CNS throughout development and regulate locomotion, motor axon targeting and neuronal survival. DNT1 (also known as NT1 and spz2) and DNT2 (also known as NT2 and spz5) interact genetically with Toll-6 and Toll-7, and DNT1 and DNT2 bind to Toll-6 and Toll-7 promiscuously and are distributed in vivo in domains complementary to or overlapping with those of Toll-6 and Toll-7.

Developmental thermal plasticity among Drosophila melanogaster populations,26230171,10.1111/jeb.12321,"Many biotic and abiotic variables influence the dispersal and distribution of organisms. Temperature has a major role in determining these patterns because it changes daily, seasonally and spatially, and these fluctuations have a significant impact on an organism's behaviour and fitness. Most ecologically relevant phenotypes that are adaptive are also complex and thus they are influenced by many underlying loci that interact with the environment. In this study, we quantified the degree of thermal phenotypic plasticity within and among populations by measuring chill-coma recovery times of lines reared from egg to adult at two different environmental temperatures. We used sixty genotypes from six natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster sampled along a latitudinal gradient in South America. We found significant variation in thermal plasticity both within and among populations. All populations exhibit a cold acclimation response, with flies reared at lower temperatures having increased resistance to cold. We tested a series of environmental parameters against the variation in population mean thermal plasticity and discovered the mean thermal plasticity was significantly correlated with altitude of origin of the population. Pairing our data with previous experiments on viability fitness assays in the same populations in fixed and variable environments suggests an adaptive role of this thermal plasticity in variable laboratory environments.

A deregulated intestinal cell cycle program disrupts tissue homeostasis without affecting longevity in Drosophila,25170078,10.1074/jbc.M114.578708,"Recent studies illuminate a complex relationship between the control of stem cell division and intestinal tissue organization in the model system Drosophila melanogaster. Host and microbial signals drive intestinal proliferation to maintain an effective epithelial barrier. Although it is widely assumed that proliferation induces dysplasia and shortens the life span of the host, the phenotypic consequences of deregulated intestinal proliferation for an otherwise healthy host remain unexplored.

"Long-lasting, experience-dependent alcohol preference in Drosophila",24164972,10.1111/adb.12105,"To understand the molecular and neural mechanisms underlying alcohol addiction, many models ranging from vertebrates to invertebrates have been developed. In Drosophila melanogaster, behavioral paradigms from assaying acute responses to alcohol and to behaviors more closely modeling addiction have emerged in recent years. However, both the CAF? assay, similar to a two-bottle choice consumption assay, as well as conditioned odor preference, where ethanol is used as the reinforcer, are labor intensive and have low throughput. To address this limitation, we have established a novel ethanol consumption preference assay, called FRAPP?, which allows for fast, high throughput measurement of consumption in individual flies, using a fluorescence plate reader. We show that naÃ¯ve flies do not prefer to consume ethanol, but various pre-exposures, such as ethanol vapor or voluntary ethanol consumption, induce ethanol preference. This ethanol-primed preference is long lasting and is not driven by calories contained in ethanol during the consumption choice. Our novel experience-dependent model of ethanol preference in Drosophila-a highly genetically tractable organism-therefore recapitulates salient features of human alcohol abuse and will facilitate the molecular understanding of the development of alcohol preference.",2014,"Raniero L Peru Y ColÃ³n de Portugal, Shamsideen A Ojelade, Pranav S Penninti, Rachel J Dove, Matthew J Nye, Summer F Acevedo, Antonio Lopez, Aylin R Rodan, Adrian Rothenfluh, Raniero L Peru Y ColÃ³n de Portugal, Shamsideen A Ojelade, Pranav S Penninti, Rachel J Dove, Matthew J Nye, Summer F Acevedo, Antonio Lopez, Aylin R Rodan, Adrian Rothenfluh"
Mitotic misbehavior of a Drosophila melanogaster satellite in ring chromosomes: insights into intragenomic conflict among heterochromatic sequences,25483254,10.4161/fly.29488,"In eukaryotes, abnormally circularized chromosomes, known as 'rings,' can be mitotically unstable. Some rings derived from a compound X-Y chromosome induce mitotic abnormalities during the embryonic cleavage divisions and early death in Drosophila melanogaster, but the underlying basis is poorly understood. We recently demonstrated that a large region of 359-bp satellite DNA, which normally resides on the X chromosome, prevents sister ring chromatids from segregating properly during these divisions. Cytogenetic comparisons among 3 different X-Y rings with varying levels of lethality showed that all 3 contain similar amounts of 359-bp DNA, but the repetitive sequences surrounding the 359-bp DNA differ in each case. This finding suggests that ring misbehavior results from novel heterochromatin position effects on the 359-bp satellite. The purpose of this view is to explore possible explanations for these effects with regard to heterochromatin formation and replication of repetitive sequences. Also discussed are similarities of this system to a satellite-based hybrid incompatibility and potential influences on genome evolution.",2014,"Patrick M Ferree, Patrick M Ferree"
No evidence for a global male-specific lethal complex-mediated dosage compensation contribution to the demasculinization of the Drosophila melanogaster X chromosome,25093841,10.1371/journal.pone.0103659,"In Drosophila melanogaster males, the expression of X-linked genes is regulated by mechanisms that operate on a chromosomal scale. One such mechanism, male-specific lethal complex-dependent X-linked dosage compensation, is thought to broadly enhance the expression of male X-linked genes through two-fold transcriptional upregulation. The evolutionary consequences of this form of dosage compensation are not well understood, particularly with regard to genes more highly expressed in males. It has been observed the X chromosome arrangement of these male-biased genes is non-random, consistent with what one might expect if there is a selective advantage for male-biased genes to avoid dosage compensation. Separately, it has been noted that the male-specific lethal complex and its dosage compensation mechanism appear absent in some male tissues, thus providing a control for the selection hypothesis. Here we utilized publicly available datasets to reassess the arrangement of X-linked male-biased expressed genes after accounting for expression in tissues not dosage compensated by the male-specific lethal complex. Our results do not corroborate previous observations supporting organismal-wide detrimental effects by dosage compensation on X-linked male-biased expressed genes. We instead find no evidence that dosage compensation has played a role in the arrangement of dosage compensated male-biased genes on the X chromosome.",2014,"Steven P Vensko 2nd, Eric A Stone, Steven P Vensko 2nd, Eric A Stone"
Lipid flippase modulates olfactory receptor expression and odorant sensitivity in Drosophila,24821794,10.1073/pnas.1401938111,"In Drosophila melanogaster, the male-specific pheromone cVA (11-cis-vaccenyl acetate) functions as a sex-specific social cue. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cVA pheromone transduction and its regulation are incomplete. Using a genetic screen combined with an electrophysiological assay to monitor pheromone-evoked activity in the cVA-sensing Or67d neurons, we identified an olfactory sensitivity factor encoded by the dATP8B gene, the Drosophila homolog of mammalian ATP8B. dATP8B is expressed in all olfactory neurons that express Orco, the odorant receptor coreceptor, and the odorant responses in most Orco-expressing neurons are reduced. Or67d neurons are severely affected, with strongly impaired cVA-induced responses and lacking spontaneous spiking in the mutants. The dATP8B locus encodes a member of the P4-type ATPase family thought to flip aminophospholipids such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine from one membrane leaflet to the other. dATP8B protein is concentrated in the cilia of olfactory neuron dendrites, the site of odorant transduction. Focusing on Or67d neuron function, we show that Or67d receptors are mislocalized in dATP8B mutants and that cVA responses can be restored to dATP8B mutants by misexpressing a wild-type dATP8B rescuing transgene, by expressing a vertebrate P4-type ATPase member in the pheromone-sensing neurons or by overexpressing Or67d receptor subunits. These findings reveal an unexpected role for lipid translocation in olfactory receptor expression and sensitivity to volatile odorants.",2014,"Tal Soo Ha, Ruohan Xia, Haiying Zhang, Xin Jin, Dean P Smith, Tal Soo Ha, Ruohan Xia, Haiying Zhang, Xin Jin, Dean P Smith"
The effect of neurospecific knockdown of candidate genes for locomotor behavior and sound production in Drosophila melanogaster,25494872,10.4161/19336934.2014.983389,"Molecular mechanisms underlying the functioning of central pattern generators (CPGs) are poorly understood. Investigations using genetic approaches in the model organism Drosophila may help to identify unknown molecular players participating in the formation or control of motor patterns. Here we report Drosophila genes as candidates for involvement in the neural mechanisms responsible for motor functions, such as locomotion and courtship song. Twenty-two Drosophila lines, used for gene identification, were isolated from a previously created collection of 1064 lines, each carrying a P element insertion in one of the autosomes. The lines displayed extreme deviations in locomotor and/or courtship song parameters compared with the whole collection. The behavioral consequences of CNS-specific RNAi-mediated knockdowns for 10 identified genes were estimated. The most prominent changes in the courtship song interpulse interval (IPI) were seen in flies with Sps2 or CG15630 knockdown. Glia-specific knockdown of these genes produced no effect on the IPI. Estrogen-induced knockdown of CG15630 in adults reduced the IPI. The product of the CNS-specific gene, CG15630 (a predicted cell surface receptor), is likely to be directly involved in the functioning of the CPG generating the pulse song pattern. Future studies should ascertain its functional role in the neurons that constitute the song CPG. Other genes (Sps2, CG34460), whose CNS-specific knockdown resulted in IPI reduction, are also worthy of detailed examination.",2014,"Sergey A Fedotov, Julia V Bragina, Natalia G Besedina, Larisa V Danilenkova, Elena A Kamysheva, Anna A Panova, Nikolai G Kamyshev, Sergey A Fedotov, Julia V Bragina, Natalia G Besedina, Larisa V Danilenkova, Elena A Kamysheva, Anna A Panova, Nikolai G Kamyshev"
Genetic damage induced by CrO 3 can be reduced by low doses of Protoporphyrin-IX in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,28962301,10.1016/j.toxrep.2014.10.007,"Several epidemiological studies have reported the relation between chromium exposure (used in different industrial processes) and cancer risk. Evidence indicates that the hexavalent form is mutagenic and carcinogenic. Chemoprevention has emerged as a good strategy for reducing the risk from exposure to heavy metals. There is evidence that some tetrapyrrols such as protoporphyrin IX (PP-IX), a porphyrin without a metal center and which is a precursor of hemoglobin and cytochrome, acts as an antioxidant modulating the induction of antioxidant enzymes. The present study was performed to evaluate their antimutagenic potential of PP-IX against genetic damage induced by chromium trioxide (CrO3). The wing spot test was used. Groups of 48 h-old larvae were pretreated for 24 h with 0, 0.69, 6.9, or 69 mM of PP-IX, after which groups of larvae were fed 0.025-2.5 mM CrO3 solution in Drosophila instant medium. The results indicated that the lower PP-IX concentration (0.69 mM) significantly reduced the genetic damage induced by all CrO3 concentrations tested. In contrast, 6.9 and 69 mM only inhibited the damage induced by CrO3 2.5 mM. Absence of an inhibitor effect of PP-IX against 20 Gy gamma rays suggested that this porphyrin acted primarily by forming complexes with chromium at low doses, inactivating its genotoxic action rather than capturing or inactivating the reactive oxygen species generated by the chromium.",2014,"Luz M Vidal E, Emilio Pimentel P, M Patricia Cruces M, Juan C SÃ¡nchez M, Luz M Vidal E, Emilio Pimentel P, M Patricia Cruces M, Juan C SÃ¡nchez M"

The Cyps associated with insecticide resistance and their neighboring non-Cyp genes have accumulated a greater number of TE fragments than the other Cyps or a random sample of genes, predominantly in the 5'-flanking regions. Most of the insertions were due to DNA transposons, with DNAREP1 fragments being the most common. These fragments carry putative binding sites for transcription factors, which reinforces the hypothesis that DNAREP1 may influence gene regulation and play a role in the adaptation of the Drosophila species.",2014,"Claudia M A Carareto, Eric H Hernandez, Cristina Vieira, Claudia M A Carareto, Eric H Hernandez, Cristina Vieira"
Fine-mapping nicotine resistance loci in Drosophila using a multiparent advanced generation inter-cross population,25236448,10.1534/genetics.114.162107,"Animals in nature are frequently challenged by toxic compounds, from those that occur naturally in plants as a defense against herbivory, to pesticides used to protect crops. On exposure to such xenobiotic substances, animals mount a transcriptional response, generating detoxification enzymes and transporters that metabolize and remove the toxin. Genetic variation in this response can lead to variation in the susceptibility of different genotypes to the toxic effects of a given xenobiotic. Here we use Drosophila melanogaster to dissect the genetic basis of larval resistance to nicotine, a common plant defense chemical and widely used addictive drug in humans. We identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the trait using the DSPR (Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource), a panel of multiparental advanced intercross lines. Mapped QTL collectively explain 68.4% of the broad-sense heritability for nicotine resistance. The two largest-effect loci-contributing 50.3 and 8.5% to the genetic variation-map to short regions encompassing members of classic detoxification gene families. The largest QTL resides over a cluster of ten UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) genes, while the next largest QTL harbors a pair of cytochrome P450 genes. Using RNAseq we measured gene expression in a pair of DSPR founders predicted to harbor different alleles at both QTL and showed that Ugt86Dd, Cyp28d1, and Cyp28d2 had significantly higher expression in the founder carrying the allele conferring greater resistance. These genes are very strong candidates to harbor causative, regulatory polymorphisms that explain a large fraction of the genetic variation in larval nicotine resistance in the DSPR.",2014,"Tara N Marriage, Elizabeth G King, Anthony D Long, Stuart J Macdonald, Tara N Marriage, Elizabeth G King, Anthony D Long, Stuart J Macdonald"

Signal characteristics effectively distinguish between different types of behaviors, such as feeding and tasting events. The FLIC system performs as well or better than popular methods for simple assays, and it provides an unprecedented opportunity to study novel components of feeding behavior, such as time-dependent changes in food preference and individual levels of motivation and hunger. Furthermore, FLIC experiments can persist indefinitely without disturbance, and we highlight this ability by establishing a detailed picture of circadian feeding behaviors in the fly. We believe that the FLIC system will work hand-in-hand with modern molecular techniques to facilitate mechanistic studies of feeding behaviors in Drosophila using modern, high-throughput technologies.",2014,"Jennifer Ro, Zachary M Harvanek, Scott D Pletcher, Jennifer Ro, Zachary M Harvanek, Scott D Pletcher"
Natural Populations of Drosophila melanogaster Reveal Features of an Uncharacterized Circadian Property: The Lower Temperature Limit of Rhythmicity,24916390,10.1177/0748730414537801,"Most cyclic biological processes are under control of a circadian molecular timing system that synchronizes these phenomena to the 24-h day. One generic property of circadian-controlled processes is that they operate within a specific temperature range, below which the manifestation of rhythm ceases. Little is known about the evolutionary relevance of the lower temperature limit of rhythmicity or about the mechanism underlying the loss of overt circadian behavior below this lower limit, especially in one model organism of chronobiology, Drosophila melanogaster. Natural populations of Drosophila are evolving under divergent selection pressures and so provide a source of diversity necessary to address these issues. Using lines derived from African populations, we find that there is natural variation in the expression of rhythmic behavior under low-temperature conditions. We found evidence that this variability is evolutionarily relevant at extremely low temperature (12 Â°C) because high-altitude populations exhibit selection for locally adapted genomes that contribute to rhythmic behavior. Lines resistant to 15 Â°C show an additional layer of diversity in their response to temperature extremes because some lines are resistant to low temperature (15 Â°C) only, whereas others are cross-resistant to high and low temperature (15 Â°C and 30 Â°C). Genetic analysis of one cold-resistant circadian line at 15 Â°C reveals that the phenotype maps to the X-chromosome but not to the core clock genes, per and sgg. Analysis of the central clock cells of this line reveals that maintenance of rhythm is associated with robust clock function, which is compromised in a standard laboratory strain. These data indicate that the cold-resistant circadian phenotype is clock based. This study highlights the importance of using natural populations to inform us of the basic features of circadian traits, especially those that might be under temperature-based selection.",2014,"Sarah E Maguire, Paul S Schmidt, Amita Sehgal, Sarah E Maguire, Paul S Schmidt, Amita Sehgal"

Hemiclonal analysis of interacting phenotypes in male and female Drosophila melanogaster,24884361,10.1186/1471-2148-14-95,"Background:
      
    

    
      Identifying the sources of variation in mating interactions between males and females is important because this variation influences the strength and/or the direction of sexual selection that populations experience. While the origins and effects of variation in male attractiveness and ornamentation have received much scrutiny, the causes and consequences of intraspecific variation in females have been relatively overlooked. We used cytogenetic cloning techniques developed for Drosophila melanogaster to create ""hemiclonal"" males and females with whom we directly observed sexual interaction between individuals of different known genetic backgrounds and measured subsequent reproductive outcomes. Using this approach, we were able to quantify the genetic contribution of each mate to the observed phenotypic variation in biologically important traits including mating speed, copulation duration, and subsequent offspring production, as well as measure the magnitude and direction of intersexual genetic correlation between female choosiness and male attractiveness.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We found significant additive genetic variation contributing to mating speed that can be attributed to male genetic identity, female genetic identity, but not their interaction. Furthermore we found that phenotypic variation in copulation duration had a significant male-associated genetic component. Female genetic identity and the interaction between male and female genetic identity accounted for a substantial amount of the observed phenotypic variation in egg size. Although previous research predicts a trade-off between egg size and fecundity, this was not evident in our results. We found a strong negative genetic correlation between female choosiness and male attractiveness, a result that suggests a potentially important role for sexually antagonistic alleles in sexual selection processes in our population.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      These results further our understanding of sexual selection because they identify that genetic identity plays a significant role in phenotypic variation in female behaviour and fecundity. This variation may be potentially due to ongoing sexual conflict found between the sexes for interacting phenotypes. Our unexpected observation of a negative correlation between female choosiness and male attractiveness highlights the need for more explicit theoretical models of genetic covariance to investigate the coevolution of female choosiness and male attractiveness.",2014,"Hannah M E Tennant, Erin E Sonser, Tristan A f Long, Hannah M E Tennant, Erin E Sonser, Tristan A f Long"
Lack of response to artificial selection on developmental stability of partial wing shape components in Drosophila melanogaster,24744255,10.1007/s10709-014-9765-6,"Developmental stability, the ability of organisms to buffer their developmental processes against developmental noise is often evaluated with fluctuating asymmetry (FA). Natural genetic variation in FA has been investigated using Drosophila wings as a model system and the recent estimation of the heritability of wing shape FA was as large as 20%. Because natural genetic variation in wing shape FA was found to localize in a partial component of the wings, heritable variation in specific parts of the wings might be responsible for FA estimation based on the whole wing shape. In this study, we quantified the shape of three partial components of the wings, and estimated the heritability of the wing shape FA based on artificial selections. As a result, FA values for the partial wing shape components did not respond to artificial selections and the heritability scores estimated were very small. These results indicate that natural additive genetic variation in FA of partial wing components was very small compared with that in a complex wing trait.",2014,"Masahiro Tsujino, Kazuo H Takahashi, Masahiro Tsujino, Kazuo H Takahashi"

We have studied the influence of the dietary supplement of the polysaccharides containing a hot water extract of the mushroom L. edodes on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster in terms of food intake, body weight, life span, and age-related locomotor activity. L. edodes extract, when added to the D. melanogaster feeding substrate at a 0.003-0.030% concentration (calculated for the dry weight of the polysaccharide fraction) did not influence food intake or body weight of the flies. It increased the life span and locomotor activities of male flies but was associated with early mortality and decreased locomotor activity of female flies. We conclude that the observed anti-aging effects of L. edodes extracts in the male D. melanogaster are not the result of dietary restriction.

Differential associative training enhances olfactory acuity in Drosophila melanogaster,24478363,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2598-13.2014,"Training can improve the ability to discriminate between similar, confusable stimuli, including odors. One possibility of enhancing behaviorally expressed discrimination (i.e., sensory acuity) relies on differential associative learning, during which animals are forced to detect the differences between similar stimuli. Drosophila represents a key model organism for analyzing neuronal mechanisms underlying both odor processing and olfactory learning. However, the ability of flies to enhance fine discrimination between similar odors through differential associative learning has not been analyzed in detail. We performed associative conditioning experiments using chemically similar odorants that we show to evoke overlapping neuronal activity in the fly's antennal lobes and highly correlated activity in mushroom body lobes. We compared the animals' performance in discriminating between these odors after subjecting them to one of two types of training: either absolute conditioning, in which only one odor is reinforced, or differential conditioning, in which one odor is reinforced and a second odor is explicitly not reinforced. First, we show that differential conditioning decreases behavioral generalization of similar odorants in a choice situation. Second, we demonstrate that this learned enhancement in olfactory acuity relies on both conditioned excitation and conditioned inhibition. Third, inhibitory local interneurons in the antennal lobes are shown to be required for behavioral fine discrimination between the two similar odors. Fourth, differential, but not absolute, training causes decorrelation of odor representations in the mushroom body. In conclusion, differential training with similar odors ultimately induces a behaviorally expressed contrast enhancement between the two similar stimuli that facilitates fine discrimination.",2014,"Jonas Barth, Shubham Dipt, Ulrike Pech, Moritz Hermann, Thomas Riemensperger, AndrÃ© Fiala, Jonas Barth, Shubham Dipt, Ulrike Pech, Moritz Hermann, Thomas Riemensperger, AndrÃ© Fiala"

Here, we report the first draft genome of Ch. tentans and characterize its gene expression machineries and genomic architecture of the BR genes.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The genome of Ch. tentans is approximately 200 Mb in size, and has a low GC content (31%) and a low repeat fraction (15%) compared to other Dipteran species. Phylogenetic inference revealed that Ch. tentans is a sister clade to mosquitoes, with a split 150-250 million years ago. To characterize the Ch. tentans gene expression machineries, we identified potential orthologus sequences to more than 600 Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster) proteins involved in the expression of protein-coding genes. We report novel data on the organization of the BR gene loci, including a novel putative BR gene, and we present a model for the organization of chromatin bundles in the BR2 puff based on genic and intergenic in situ hybridizations.

A staging scheme for the development of the moth midge Clogmia albipunctata,24409296,10.1371/journal.pone.0084422,"Model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, allow us to address a wide range of biological questions with experimental rigour. However, studies in model species need to be complemented by comparative studies if we are to fully understand the functional properties and evolutionary history of developmental processes. The establishment of new model organisms is crucial for this purpose. One of the first essential steps to establish a species as an experimental model is to carefully describe its life cycle and development. The resulting staging scheme serves as a framework for molecular studies, and allows us to homologise developmental processes between species. In this paper, we have characterised the life cycle and development of an emerging non-drosophilid dipteran model system: the moth midge Clogmia albipunctata. In particular, we focus on early embryogenesis (cleavage and blastoderm cycles before gastrulation), on formation and retraction of extraembryonic tissues, and on formation of the germ line. Considering the large evolutionary distance between the two species (approximately 250 million years), we find that the development of C. albipunctata is remarkably conserved compared to D. melanogaster. On the other hand, we detect significant differences in morphology and timing affecting the development of extraembryonic tissues and the germ line. Moreover, C. albipunctata shows several heterochronic shifts, and lacks head involution and associated processes during late stages of development.",2014,"Eva JimÃ©nez-Guri, Karl R Wotton, Brenda GavilÃ¡n, Johannes Jaeger, Eva JimÃ©nez-Guri, Karl R Wotton, Brenda GavilÃ¡n, Johannes Jaeger"
Stereotyped connectivity and computations in higher-order olfactory neurons,24362761,10.1038/nn.3613,"In the first brain relay of the olfactory system, odors are encoded by combinations of glomeruli, but it is not known how glomerular signals are ultimately integrated. In Drosophila melanogaster, the majority of glomerular projections target the lateral horn. Here we show that lateral horn neurons (LHNs) receive input from sparse and stereotyped combinations of glomeruli that are coactivated by odors, and certain combinations of glomeruli are over-represented. One morphological LHN type is broadly tuned and sums input from multiple glomeruli. These neurons have a broader dynamic range than their individual glomerular inputs do. By contrast, a second morphological type is narrowly tuned and receives prominent odor-selective inhibition through both direct and indirect pathways. We show that this wiring scheme confers increased selectivity. The biased stereotyped connectivity of the lateral horn contrasts with the probabilistic wiring of the mushroom body, reflecting the distinct roles of these regions in innate as compared to learned behaviors.",2014,"Mehmet Fi?ek, Rachel I Wilson, Mehmet Fi?ek, Rachel I Wilson"
Regulation of Drosophila intestinal stem cell maintenance and differentiation by the transcription factor Escargot,25433031,10.15252/embj.201489050,"Tissue stem cells divide to self-renew and generate differentiated cells to maintain homeostasis. Although influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, the genetic mechanisms coordinating the decision between self-renewal and initiation of differentiation remain poorly understood. The escargot (esg) gene encodes a transcription factor that is expressed in stem cells in multiple tissues in Drosophila melanogaster, including intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Here, we demonstrate that Esg plays a pivotal role in intestinal homeostasis, maintaining the stem cell pool while influencing fate decisions through modulation of Notch activity. Loss of esg induced ISC differentiation, a decline in Notch activity in daughter enteroblasts (EB), and an increase in differentiated enteroendocrine (EE) cells. Amun, an inhibitor of Notch in other systems, was identified as a target of Esg in the intestine. Decreased expression of esg resulted in upregulation of Amun, while downregulation of Amun rescued the ectopic EE cell phenotype resulting from loss of esg. Thus, our findings provide a framework for further comparative studies addressing the conserved roles of Snail factors in coordinating self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells across tissues and species.",2014,"Mariano A Loza-Coll, Tony D Southall, Sharsti L Sandall, Andrea H Brand, D Leanne Jones, Mariano A Loza-Coll, Tony D Southall, Sharsti L Sandall, Andrea H Brand, D Leanne Jones"
Copper overload and deficiency both adversely affect the central nervous system of Drosophila,25322772,10.1039/c4mt00140k,"The human copper homeostasis disorders Menkes and Wilson disease both have severe neurological symptoms. Menkes is a copper deficiency disorder whereas Wilson disease patients suffer from copper toxicity, indicating that tight control of neuronal copper levels is essential for proper nervous system development and function. Here we examine the consequences of neuronal copper deficiency and excess in the Drosophila melanogaster nervous system, using targeted manipulation of the copper uptake genes Ctr1A and Ctr1B and efflux gene ATP7 in combination with altered dietary copper levels. We find that pan-neuronal over expression of Ctr1B and ATP7 both result in a reduction in viability. The effects of Ctr1B over expression are exacerbated by dietary copper supplementation and rescued by copper limitation indicating a copper toxicity phenotype. Dietary manipulation has the opposite effect on ATP7 over expression, indicating that this causes neuronal copper deficiency due to excessive copper efflux. Copper deficiency also causes a highly penetrant developmental defect in surviving adult flies which can be replicated by both copper excess and copper deficiency targeted specifically to a small subset of neuropeptidergic cells. We conclude that both copper overload and excess have detrimental effects on Drosophila neuronal function, reducing overall fly viability as well as impacting on a specific neuropeptide pathway.",2014,"Joab E C Hwang, Marinus de Bruyne, Coral G Warr, Richard Burke, Joab E C Hwang, Marinus de Bruyne, Coral G Warr, Richard Burke"
In between: gypsy in Drosophila melanogaster reveals new insights into endogenous retrovirus evolution,25502325,10.3390/v6124914,"Retroviruses are RNA viruses that are able to synthesize a DNA copy of their genome and insert it into a chromosome of the host cell. Sequencing of different eukaryote genomes has revealed the presence of many such endogenous retroviral sequences. The mechanisms by which these retroviral sequences have colonized the genome are still unknown, and the endogenous retrovirus gypsy of Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful experimental model for deciphering this process in vivo. Gypsy is expressed in a layer of somatic cells, and then transferred into the oocyte by an unknown mechanism. This critical step is the start of the endogenization process. Moreover gypsy has been shown to have infectious properties, probably due to its envelope gene acquired from a baculovirus. Recently we have also shown that gypsy maternal transmission is reduced in the presence of the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia. These studies demonstrate that gypsy is a unique and powerful model for understanding the endogenization of retroviruses.",2014,"Franck Touret, FranÃ§ois Guiguen, Timothy Greenland, Christophe Terzian, Franck Touret, FranÃ§ois Guiguen, Timothy Greenland, Christophe Terzian"
Fine mapping of dominant X-linked incompatibility alleles in Drosophila hybrids,24743238,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004270,"Sex chromosomes have a large effect on reproductive isolation and play an important role in hybrid inviability. In Drosophila hybrids, X-linked genes have pronounced deleterious effects on fitness in male hybrids, which have only one X chromosome. Several studies have succeeded at locating and identifying recessive X-linked alleles involved in hybrid inviability. Nonetheless, the density of dominant X-linked alleles involved in interspecific hybrid viability remains largely unknown. In this report, we study the effects of a panel of small fragments of the D. melanogaster X-chromosome carried on the D. melanogaster Y-chromosome in three kinds of hybrid males: D. melanogaster/D. santomea, D. melanogaster/D. simulans and D. melanogaster/D. mauritiana. D. santomea and D. melanogaster diverged over 10 million years ago, while D. simulans (and D. mauritiana) diverged from D. melanogaster over 3 million years ago. We find that the X-chromosome from D. melanogaster carries dominant alleles that are lethal in mel/san, mel/sim, and mel/mau hybrids, and more of these alleles are revealed in the most divergent cross. We then compare these effects on hybrid viability with two D. melanogaster intraspecific crosses. Unlike the interspecific crosses, we found no X-linked alleles that cause lethality in intraspecific crosses. Our results reveal the existence of dominant alleles on the X-chromosome of D. melanogaster which cause lethality in three different interspecific hybrids. These alleles only cause inviability in hybrid males, yet have little effect in hybrid females. This suggests that X-linked elements that cause hybrid inviability in males might not do so in hybrid females due to differing sex chromosome interactions.",2014,"Daniel R Matute, Jackie Gavin-Smyth, Daniel R Matute, Jackie Gavin-Smyth"

Loss of dcr-2 function reduces the resistance of adult flies to various stresses and shortens their life span. The mutants also exhibit alterations in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. These findings suggest that the endo-siRNA pathway plays a protective role during exposure to stress and aging in D. melanogaster, possibly by regulating metabolic homeostasis.

Decoding odor quality and intensity in the Drosophila brain,25512254,10.7554/eLife.04147,"To internally reflect the sensory environment, animals create neural maps encoding the external stimulus space. From that primary neural code relevant information has to be extracted for accurate navigation. We analyzed how different odor features such as hedonic valence and intensity are functionally integrated in the lateral horn (LH) of the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We characterized an olfactory-processing pathway, comprised of inhibitory projection neurons (iPNs) that target the LH exclusively, at morphological, functional and behavioral levels. We demonstrate that iPNs are subdivided into two morphological groups encoding positive hedonic valence or intensity information and conveying these features into separate domains in the LH. Silencing iPNs severely diminished flies' attraction behavior. Moreover, functional imaging disclosed a LH region tuned to repulsive odors comprised exclusively of third-order neurons.

Here, we identify the scaffold G protein coupled receptor kinase 2 interacting (GIT) protein as a component of the AZ-associated cytomatrix and as a regulator of SV endocytosis. GIT1 and its D. melanogaster ortholog, dGIT, are shown to directly associate with the endocytic adaptor stonin 2/stoned B. In Drosophila dgit mutants, stoned B and synaptotagmin levels are reduced and stoned B is partially mislocalized. Moreover, dgit mutants show morphological and functional defects in SV recycling.

This resulted in two relatively small regions of 131 kb and 124 kb. The latter one co-localizes with a very strong selective sweep in the European population. We examined the genes within and near the sweep region individually using gene expression analysis and P-element insertion lines. Of the genes overlapping with the sweep, none appears to be related to CCRT. However, we have identified a new candidate gene of CCRT, brinker, which is located just outside the sweep region and is inducible by cold stress.

Drosophila modifier screens to identify novel neuropsychiatric drugs including aminergic agents for the possible treatment of Parkinson's disease and depression,23229049,10.1038/mp.2012.170,"Small molecules that increase the presynaptic function of aminergic cells may provide neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as treatments for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression. Model genetic organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster may enhance the detection of new drugs via modifier or 'enhancer/suppressor' screens, but this technique has not been applied to processes relevant to psychiatry. To identify new aminergic drugs in vivo, we used a mutation in the Drosophila vesicular monoamine transporter (dVMAT) as a sensitized genetic background and performed a suppressor screen. We fed dVMAT mutant larvae ??1000 known drugs and quantitated rescue (suppression) of an amine-dependent locomotor deficit in the larva. To determine which drugs might specifically potentiate neurotransmitter release, we performed an additional secondary screen for drugs that require presynaptic amine storage to rescue larval locomotion. Using additional larval locomotion and adult fertility assays, we validated that at least one compound previously used clinically as an antineoplastic agent potentiates the presynaptic function of aminergic circuits. We suggest that structurally similar agents might be used to development treatments for PD, depression and ADHD, and that modifier screens in Drosophila provide a new strategy to screen for neuropsychiatric drugs.

Germ line reversion events are genetically stable, while the somatic variegation patterns are not heritable. The patterns of eye pigment variegation produced suggests that reversion events are occurring throughout development.

Genomic distribution of copia-like transposable elements in somatic tissues and during development of Drosophila melanogaster,2560696,10.1007/BF00292785,"The genomic distribution of elements of the copia, 412, B 104, mdg 1, mdg 4 and 1731 transposon families was compared by the Southern technique in DNA preparations extracted from brains, salivary glands and adult flies of two related Drosophila lines. The copia, 412 and mdg 1 sequences were also probed in DNA from sperm, embryos, and 1st and 2nd instar larvae. The homogeneity of the patterns observed shows that somatic transposition is unlikely to occur frequently. A correlation between mobility and the euchromatic or heterochromatic location of transposable elements is discussed. In addition, an explanation of the variable band intensities of transposable elements in Southern autoradiographs is proposed.",1989,"C Di Franco, C Pisano, P Dimitri, S Gigliotti, N Junakovic, C Di Franco, C Pisano, P Dimitri, S Gigliotti, N Junakovic"
Distribution and conservation of the foldback transposable element in Drosophila,2538638,10.1007/BF02102479,Foldback elements are a family of transposable elements described in Drosophila melanogaster. The members of this dispersed repetitive family have terminal inverted repeats that sometimes flank a central region. The inverted repeats of all the family members are homologous. The study of the distribution and conservation of the foldback elements in different Drosophila species shows that this distribution is different from that of the hybrid dysgenesis systems (PM and IR). Sequences homologous to foldback elements were observed by Southern blots and in situ hybridization in all species of the melanogaster subgroup and in some species of the montium and takahashii subgroups. The element was probably already present before the radiation of these subgroups. No evidence of horizontal transmission of the foldback element could be observed.,1989,"J Silber, C Bazin, F Lemeunier, S Aulard, M Volovitch, J Silber, C Bazin, F Lemeunier, S Aulard, M Volovitch"
The expression of the neurogenic locus Notch during the postembryonic development of Drosophila melanogaster and its relationship to mitotic activity,2506320,10.3109/01677068909107097,"The molecular analysis of the Notch locus of Drosophila melanogaster demonstrated that it codes for a protein which shows homology to the epidermal growth factor as well as to the products of certain yeast genes involved in the control of the cell cycle (Wharton et al., 1985a; Breeden and Nasmyth, 1987). The structure of the protein suggests that Notch is involved in a cell interaction mechanism which controls the differentiation of several different tissues during development. Here we examine Notch expression during imaginal development using in situ hybridization to tissue sections and demonstrate that Notch is not expressed ubiquitously during the postembryonic stages, but rather is confined to specific tissues. During the larval and early pupal period Notch transcripts are predominantly localized in the imaginal discs and the central nervous system. In the middle and late pupal period the signal levels in these tissues drop dramatically and in the adult animal Notch transcripts are essentially detected only in the ovaries. In the larval stages the pattern of Notch expression appears to be closely correlated with mitotically active tissues, while in later stages this correlation appears less strict. The findings reported here indicate that there is a requirement for normal Notch function in a number of tissues at several developmental stages and that the pleiotropic phenotypic manifestation of Notch mutations is a context dependent developmental result. The observed association of Notch expression with mitotically active cell populations raises the possibility that Notch may play a role in the cell cycle.",1989,"K Markopoulou, S Artavanis-Tsakonas, K Markopoulou, S Artavanis-Tsakonas"
Complex spatio-temporal accumulation of alternative transcripts from the neurogenic gene Delta during Drosophila embryogenesis,2612381,,"Delta (Dl) function is required for proper specification of epidermal and neural lineages within the neurogenic ectoderm of Drosophila melanogaster. We have determined the spatial accumulation of five Dl transcripts that arise as the result of alternative RNA processing during embryogenesis. We find that these transcripts accumulate in all cells of the neurogenic ectoderm immediately preceding neuroblast segregation, indicating that transcription of Dl does not differ between presumptive neuroblasts and presumptive dermoblasts. Dl transcripts also accumulate transiently in mesodermal and endodermal cells, suggesting that Dl may function in developmental processes in addition to differentiation of the neurogenic ectoderm. We find that three of the Dl transcripts are localized to the base of the nucleus during cellularization. The apparent association of these three transcripts with polysomes suggests that they accumulate within the cytoplasm at the nuclear periphery and is consistent with the hypothesis that Dl encodes multiple translational products.",1989,"C C Kopczynski, M A Muskavitch, C C Kopczynski, M A Muskavitch"

Transposable elements and fitness in Drosophila melanogaster,2556325,10.1139/g89-046,"Transposable elements constitute a significant fraction of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The five families of moderately repeated transposable elements identified to date occupy dispersed and variable genomic locations, but have relatively constant copy numbers per individual. What effect to these elements have on the fitness of the individuals harboring them? Experimental evidence relating to this question is reviewed. The relevant data fall into two broad categories. The first involves the determination of the distribution of transposable elements in natural populations, by restriction mapping or in situ hybridization, and the comparison of the observed distribution with different theoretical expectations. The second approach is to study directly the effects of new transposable element-induced mutations on fitness. The P family of transposable elements is a particularly efficient mutagen, and the results of experiments in which initially P-free chromosomes are contaminated with P elements are discussed with regard to P-induced fitness mutations.",1989,"T F Mackay, T F Mackay"
Transcriptional activation and repression by Ultrabithorax proteins in cultured Drosophila cells,2567632,10.1016/0092-8674(89)90341-3,"Homeotic genes of Drosophila melanogaster such as Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and Antennapedia (Antp) have long been thought to select metameric identity during development by controlling the expression of various target genes. Here we describe a cotransfection assay in cultured D. melanogaster cells that is used to demonstrate that Ubx proteins (UBX) can repress an Antp promoter fusion and activate a Ubx promoter fusion, activities predicted from genetic studies. We show (a) that UBX proteins regulated the level of accurately initiated Antp P1 and Ubx transcripts, (b) that activation of the Ubx promoter required a downstream cluster of UBX binding sites, and (c) that binding site sequences were sufficient to confer regulation on a heterologous promoter, regardless of their orientation or precise position. We conclude that UBX proteins are transcriptional repressors and activators, and that their actions are mediated by binding to promoter region sequences. Each member of the UBX protein family has similar regulatory abilities, but the properties of synthetic mutant forms suggest that UBX proteins may have a modular design similar to other transcriptional regulators.",1989,"M A Krasnow, E E Saffman, K Kornfeld, D S Hogness, M A Krasnow, E E Saffman, K Kornfeld, D S Hogness"
Nucleotide variation and divergence in the histone multigene family in Drosophila melanogaster,2499516,,"Nucleotide differences in the histone H3 gene family in Drosophila melanogaster were studied on three levels: (1) within a chromosome, (2) within a population and (3) between species (D. melanogaster and Drosophila simulans). The average difference within the H3 gene within a chromosome was 0.0040 per nucleotide site, about 52% of that within a population (0.0077). The proportion of divergent sites between the two species was 0.0575, which is about 8.5 times the difference within a species. The distribution of divergence between species was similar to that of variation within a species. Divergence and variation were noted to be greatest in the 3' noncoding region and least in the coding region. Values intermediate between these were found for the 5' noncoding region. Divergence and variation in silent sites exceeded those in the total coding region, thus indicating possible purifying selection for amino-acid-altering change. Phylogenetic relations among H3 genes and genetic differences on these three levels are evidence for the concerted evolution of the histone gene family. The molecular mechanism by which variation is produced and maintained is discussed.",1989,"Y Matsuo, T Yamazaki, Y Matsuo, T Yamazaki"
Genetic analysis of the claret locus of Drosophila melanogaster,2513253,,"The claret (ca) locus of Drosophila melanogaster comprises two separately mutable domains, one responsible for eye color and one responsible for proper disjunction of chromosomes in meiosis and early cleavage divisions. Previously isolated alleles are of three types: (1) alleles of the claret (ca) type that affect eye color only, (2) alleles of the claret-nondisjunctional (cand) type that affect eye color and chromosome behavior, and (3) a meiotic mutation, non-claret disjunctional (ncd), that affects chromosome behavior only. In order to investigate the genetic structure of the claret locus, we have isolated 19 radiation-induced alleles of claret on the basis of the eye color phenotype. Two of these 19 new alleles are of the cand type, while 17 are of the ca type, demonstrating that the two domains do not often act as a single target for mutagenesis. This suggests that the two separately mutable functions are likely to be encoded by separate or overlapping genes rather than by a single gene. One of the new alleles of the cand type is a chromosome rearrangement with a breakpoint at the position of the claret locus. If this breakpoint is the cause of the mutant phenotype and there are no other mutations associated with the rearrangement, the two functions must be encoded by overlapping genes.",1989,"W Sequeira, C R Nelson, P Szauter, W Sequeira, C R Nelson, P Szauter"
Restriction-map variation with the yellow-achaete-scute region in five populations of Drosophila melanogaster,2552253,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040565,"It has been proposed that the degree of recombination for a genomic region will affect the level of both nucleotide heterozygosity and the density of transposable elements. Both features of genomic diversity have been examined in a number of recent reports for regions undergoing relatively normal levels of recombination in Drosophila melanogaster. In this study the genomic variation associated with yellow-achaete-scute loci located at the tip of the X chromosome is examined by six-cutter restriction mapping. In this region, as usual for regions adjacent to telomeres, crossing-over is dramatically reduced, and published studies of visible mutants indicate extremely little restriction-map variation. Eight six-cutter restriction endonucleases were used to locate sequence variation in 14- and 16.5-kb regions in 109 lines sampled from North America, Africa, and Europe. The overall level of heterozygosity is estimated as 0.29%. Nine large insertions, all presumed to be transposable elements, were observed. Base-pair heterozygosity appears to be reduced compared with regions having normal levels of recombination. The estimated heterozygosity is much higher than reported in earlier studies of restriction-map variation among visible mutations in the complex. The incidence of large insertions is not elevated compared with that in other regions of the genome. This suggests that asymmetric synapsis and exchange is not an important mechanism for the elimination of transposable elements.",1989,"W F Eanes, J Labate, J W Ajioka, W F Eanes, J Labate, J W Ajioka"

Germ line clones of all eight mutants were generated using the dominant female sterile technique. Seven of the eight mutations are germ line specific, indicating that, although the eggshell is produced by the follicular cells, germ line functions play a significant role in its elaboration.

Genetic characterization of the mei-41 locus in Drosophila melanogaster,2496295,10.1007/BF00339717,"The mutagen-sensitive mutant mus(1) 104D1 of Drosophila melanogaster maps to a position on the X chromosome very close to the meiotic mutant mei-41D5. Both mutants have been characterized as mutagen-sensitive and defective in post-replication repair. In the present report we show by complementation studies that mus(1) 104 and mus(1) 103 are allelic with mei-41. In addition, two reported alleles of mus(1) 104 lie between the mei-41 alleles A10 and D5. The size of the mei-41 locus is estimated to be about 0.1 centimorgans (cM). Because several alleles of mei-41 have been shown to reduce recombination and increase meiotic chromosome loss and nondisjunction, mus(1) 104D1 females were examined for defects in meiosis. Although there was no evidence for reduced recombination on the second chromosome in homozygous mus(1) 104D1 females, heterozygous mus(1) 104D1/mei-41D5 and mus(1) 104D1/deficiency females showed reduced levels of recombination.

Tea polyphenols ameliorate fat storage induced by high-fat diet in Drosophila melanogaster,29124233,10.1016/j.bbrep.2015.10.013,"Background:
      
    

    
      Polyphenols in tea are considered beneficial to human health. However, many such claims of their bioactivity still require in vitro and in vivo evidence.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model multicellular organism, we assess the fat accumulation-suppressing effects of theaflavin (TF), a tea polyphenol; epitheaflagallin (ETG), which has an unknown function; and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), a prominent component of green tea. Dietary TF reduced the malondialdehyde accumulation related to a high-fat diet in adult flies. Other physiological and genetic responses induced by the high-fat diet, such as lipid accumulation in the fat body and expression of lipid metabolism-related genes, were ameliorated by the addition of TF, ETG, and EGCg, in some cases approaching respective levels without high-fat diet exposure. Continuous ingestion of the three polyphenols resulted in a shortened lifespan.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:

An Interaction between RRP6 and SU(VAR)3-9 Targets RRP6 to Heterochromatin and Contributes to Heterochromatin Maintenance in Drosophila melanogaster,26389589,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005523,"RNA surveillance factors are involved in heterochromatin regulation in yeast and plants, but less is known about the possible roles of ribonucleases in the heterochromatin of animal cells. Here we show that RRP6, one of the catalytic subunits of the exosome, is necessary for silencing heterochromatic repeats in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. We show that a fraction of RRP6 is associated with heterochromatin, and the analysis of the RRP6 interaction network revealed physical links between RRP6 and the heterochromatin factors HP1a, SU(VAR)3-9 and RPD3. Moreover, genome-wide studies of RRP6 occupancy in cells depleted of SU(VAR)3-9 demonstrated that SU(VAR)3-9 contributes to the tethering of RRP6 to a subset of heterochromatic loci. Depletion of the exosome ribonucleases RRP6 and DIS3 stabilizes heterochromatic transcripts derived from transposons and repetitive sequences, and renders the heterochromatin less compact, as shown by micrococcal nuclease and proximity-ligation assays. Such depletion also increases the amount of HP1a bound to heterochromatic transcripts. Taken together, our results suggest that SU(VAR)3-9 targets RRP6 to a subset of heterochromatic loci where RRP6 degrades chromatin-associated non-coding RNAs in a process that is necessary to maintain the packaging of the heterochromatin.",2015,"Andrea B Eberle, Antonio JordÃ¡n-Pla, Antoni GaÃ±ez-Zapater, Viktoria Hessle, Gilad Silberberg, Anne von Euler, Rebecca A Silverstein, Neus Visa, Andrea B Eberle, Antonio JordÃ¡n-Pla, Antoni GaÃ±ez-Zapater, Viktoria Hessle, Gilad Silberberg, Anne von Euler, Rebecca A Silverstein, Neus Visa"
Unique transposon landscapes are pervasive across Drosophila melanogaster genomes,26578579,10.1093/nar/gkv1193,"To understand how transposon landscapes (TLs) vary across animal genomes, we describe a new method called the Transposon Insertion and Depletion AnaLyzer (TIDAL) and a database of >300 TLs in Drosophila melanogaster (TIDAL-Fly).

On average, >500 novel insertions exist in every lab strain, inbred strains of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), and fly isolates in the Drosophila Genome Nexus (DGN). A minority (<25%) of transposon families comprise the majority (>70%) of TL diversity across fly strains. A sharp contrast between insertion and depletion patterns indicates that many transposons are unique to the ISO1 reference genome sequence. Although TL diversity from fly strains reaches asymptotic limits with increasing sequencing depth, rampant TL diversity causes unsaturated detection of TLs in pools of flies. Finally, we show novel transposon insertions negatively correlate with Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) levels for most transposon families, except for the highly-abundant roo retrotransposon.

Here we discuss the similarities of plasmatocyte developmental migration and its functions to that of vertebrate macrophages, considering the recent controversy regarding the functions of Drosophila PDGF/VEGF related ligands.

Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a key gene product in the response to oxygen deprivation, is primarily regulated by prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs). However, recent findings have uncovered novel HIF-independent functions of PHDs. This review provides an overview of how invertebrates are able to sustain hypoxic damages, and highlights some recent discoveries in the regulation of cellular signalling by PHDs.

Related male Drosophila melanogaster reared together as larvae fight less and sire longer lived daughters,26306167,10.1002/ece3.1549,"Competition over access to reproductive opportunities can lead males to harm females. However, recent work has shown that, in Drosophila melanogaster, male competition and male harm of females are both reduced under conditions simulating male-specific population viscosity (i.e., in groups where males are related and reared with each other as larvae). Here, we seek to replicate these findings and investigate whether male population viscosity can have repercussions for the fitness of offspring in the next generation. We show that groups of unrelated-unfamiliar (i.e., unrelated individuals raised apart) males fight more intensely than groups of related-familiar males (i.e., full siblings raised together as larvae), supporting previous findings, and that exposure to a female is required to trigger these differential patterns of male-male competition. Importantly, we show that differences in male-male competition can be associated with transgenerational effects: the daughters of females exposed to unrelated-unfamiliar males suffered higher mortality than the daughters of females exposed to related-familiar males. Collectively, these results suggest that population structure (i.e., variation in the relatedness and/or larval familiarity of local male groups) can modulate male-male competition with important transgenerational consequences.",2015,"Pau Carazo, Jennifer C Perry, Fern Johnson, Tommaso Pizzari, Stuart Wigby, Pau Carazo, Jennifer C Perry, Fern Johnson, Tommaso Pizzari, Stuart Wigby"

An effector Peptide family required for Drosophila toll-mediated immunity,25915418,10.1371/journal.ppat.1004876,"In Drosophila melanogaster, recognition of an invading pathogen activates the Toll or Imd signaling pathway, triggering robust upregulation of innate immune effectors. Although the mechanisms of pathogen recognition and signaling are now well understood, the functions of the immune-induced transcriptome and proteome remain much less well characterized. Through bioinformatic analysis of effector gene sequences, we have defined a family of twelve genes - the Bomanins (Boms) - that are specifically induced by Toll and that encode small, secreted peptides of unknown biochemical activity. Using targeted genome engineering, we have deleted ten of the twelve Bom genes. Remarkably, inactivating these ten genes decreases survival upon microbial infection to the same extent, and with the same specificity, as does eliminating Toll pathway function. Toll signaling, however, appears unaffected. Assaying bacterial load post-infection in wild-type and mutant flies, we provide evidence that the Boms are required for resistance to, rather than tolerance of, infection. In addition, by generating and assaying a deletion of a smaller subset of the Bom genes, we find that there is overlap in Bom activity toward particular pathogens. Together, these studies deepen our understanding of Toll-mediated immunity and provide a new in vivo model for exploration of the innate immune effector repertoire.",2015,"Alexa W Clemmons, Scott A Lindsay, Steven A Wasserman, Alexa W Clemmons, Scott A Lindsay, Steven A Wasserman"
The carcinine transporter CarT is required in Drosophila photoreceptor neurons to sustain histamine recycling,26653853,10.7554/eLife.10972,"Synaptic transmission from Drosophila photoreceptors to lamina neurons requires recycling of histamine neurotransmitter. Synaptic histamine is cleared by uptake into glia and conversion into carcinine, which functions as transport metabolite. How carcinine is transported from glia to photoreceptor neurons remains unclear. In a targeted RNAi screen for genes involved in this pathway, we identified carT, which encodes a member of the SLC22A transporter family. CarT expression in photoreceptors is necessary and sufficient for fly vision and behavior. Carcinine accumulates in the lamina of carT flies. Wild-type levels are restored by photoreceptor-specific expression of CarT, and endogenous tagging suggests CarT localizes to synaptic endings. Heterologous expression of CarT in S2 cells is sufficient for carcinine uptake, demonstrating the ability of CarT to utilize carcinine as a transport substrate. Together, our results demonstrate that CarT transports the histamine metabolite carcinine into photoreceptor neurons, thus contributing an essential step to the histamine-carcinine cycle.",2015,"Drew Stenesen, Andrew T Moehlman, Helmut KrÃ¤mer, Drew Stenesen, Andrew T Moehlman, Helmut KrÃ¤mer"

Genome-wide association studies to identify the genetic basis of the microbiota-dependent variation reveal polymorphisms in largely non-overlapping sets of genes associated with variation in the nutritional traits, including strong representation of conserved genes functioning in signalling.

Retention of Ejaculate by Drosophila melanogaster Females Requires the Male-Derived Mating Plug Protein PEBme,26058847,10.1534/genetics.115.176669,"Within the mated reproductive tracts of females of many taxa, seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) coagulate into a structure known as the mating plug (MP). MPs have diverse roles, including preventing female remating, altering female receptivity postmating, and being necessary for mated females to successfully store sperm. The Drosophila melanogaster MP, which is maintained in the mated female for several hours postmating, is comprised of a posterior MP (PMP) that forms quickly after mating begins and an anterior MP (AMP) that forms later. The PMP is composed of seminal proteins from the ejaculatory bulb (EB) of the male reproductive tract. To examine the role of the PMP protein PEBme in D. melanogaster reproduction, we identified an EB GAL4 driver and used it to target PEBme for RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown. PEBme knockdown in males compromised PMP coagulation in their mates and resulted in a significant reduction in female fertility, adversely affecting postmating uterine conformation, sperm storage, mating refractoriness, egg laying, and progeny generation. These defects resulted from the inability of females to retain the ejaculate in their reproductive tracts after mating. The uncoagulated MP impaired uncoupling by the knockdown male, and when he ultimately uncoupled, the ejaculate was often pulled out of the female. Thus, PEBme and MP coagulation are required for optimal fertility in D. melanogaster. Given the importance of the PMP for fertility, we identified additional MP proteins by mass spectrometry and found fertility functions for two of them. Our results highlight the importance of the MP and the proteins that comprise it in reproduction and suggest that in Drosophila the PMP is required to retain the ejaculate within the female reproductive tract, ensuring the storage of sperm by mated females.",2015,"Frank W Avila, Allie B Cohen, Fatima S Ameerudeen, David Duneau, Shruthi Suresh, Alexandra L Mattei, Mariana F Wolfner"
Asterless Reduction during Spermiogenesis Is Regulated by Plk4 and Is Essential for Zygote Development in Drosophila,26480844,10.1016/j.cub.2015.09.045,"Centrosome reduction is the decrease in centrosomal components during spermatid differentiation (spermiogenesis). It is one of several dramatic subcellular reorganizations that lead to spermatozoa formation common to a wide range of animals. However, the mechanism underlying centrosome reduction is unknown and its functions are unclear. Here, we show that in Drosophila melanogaster spermiogenesis, the quantity of centrosomal proteins is dramatically reduced; for example, Asterless (Asl) is reduced ??00-fold and is barely detected in spermatozoa. Asl reduction is regulated through a subset of its domains by the master regulator of centriole duplication Plk4 and by the ubiquitin ligase that targets Plk4 for degradation: Slimb. When Asl reduction is attenuated by Asl overexpression, plk4 mutations, Plk4 RNAi, or Slimb overexpression, Asl levels are higher in spermatozoa, resulting in embryos with reduced viability. Significantly, overexpressing Plk4 and Asl simultaneously, or combining plk4 and slimb mutations, balances their opposing effects on Asl reduction, restoring seemingly normal fertility. This suggests that increased Asl levels cause the observed reduced fertility and not other pleotropic effects. Attenuation of Asl reduction also causes delayed development and a failure to form astral microtubules in the zygote. Together, we provide the first insight into a molecular mechanism that regulates centrosome reduction and the first direct evidence that centrosome reduction is essential for post-fertilization development.",2015,"Atul Khire, Alberto A Vizuet, Enrique Davila, Tomer Avidor-Reiss, Atul Khire, Alberto A Vizuet, Enrique Davila, Tomer Avidor-Reiss"
Temporal and spatial dynamics of scaling-specific features of a gene regulatory network in Drosophila,26644070,10.1038/ncomms10031,"A widely appreciated aspect of developmental robustness is pattern formation in proportion to size. But how such scaling features emerge dynamically remains poorly understood. Here we generate a data set of the expression profiles of six gap genes in Drosophila melanogaster embryos that differ significantly in size. Expression patterns exhibit size-dependent dynamics both spatially and temporally. We uncover a dynamic emergence of under-scaling in the posterior, accompanied by reduced expression levels of gap genes near the middle of large embryos. Simulation results show that a size-dependent Bicoid gradient input can lead to reduced KrÃ¼ppel expression that can have long-range and dynamic effects on gap gene expression in the posterior. Thus, for emergence of scaled patterns, the entire embryo may be viewed as a single unified dynamic system where maternally derived size-dependent information interpreted locally can be propagated in space and time as governed by the dynamics of a gene regulatory network.",2015,"Honggang Wu, Manu, Renjie Jiao, Jun Ma, Honggang Wu, Manu, Renjie Jiao, Jun Ma"
Efficacy of methuselah gene mutation toward tolerance of dichlorvos exposure in Drosophila melanogaster,25746179,10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.02.025,"Adverse reports on the exposure of organisms to dichlorvos (DDVP; an organophosphate insecticide) necessitate studies of organismal resistance/tolerance by way of pharmacological or genetic means. In the context of genetic modulation, a mutation in methuselah (mth; encodes a class II G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)) is reported to extend (~35%) the life span of Drosophila melanogaster and enhance their resistance to oxidative stress induced by paraquat exposure (short term, high level). A lack of studies on organismal tolerance of DDVP by genetic modulation prompted us to examine the protective efficacy of mth mutation in exposed Drosophila. Flies were exposed to 1.5 and 15.0 ng/ml DDVP for 12-48 h to examine oxidative stress endpoints and chemical resistance. After prolonged exposure of flies to DDVP, antioxidant enzyme activities, oxidative stress, glutathione content, and locomotor performance were assayed at various days (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50) of age. Flies with the mth mutation (mth(1)) showed improved chemical resistance and rescued redox impairment after acute DDVP exposure. Exposed mth(1) flies exhibited improved life span along with enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities and rescued oxidative perturbations and locomotor insufficiency up to middle age (~20 days) over similarly exposed w(1118) flies. However, at late (??0 days) age, these benefits were undermined. Further, similarly exposed mth-knockdown flies showed effects similar to those observed in mth(1) flies. This study provides evidence of tolerance in organisms carrying a mth mutation against prolonged DDVP exposure and further warrants examination of similar class II GPCR signaling facets toward better organismal health.",2015,"Ashutosh Pandey, Rehana Khatoon, Sanjay Saini, Divya Vimal, Devendra Kumar Patel, Gopeshwar Narayan, Debapratim Kar Chowdhuri, Ashutosh Pandey, Rehana Khatoon, Sanjay Saini, Divya Vimal, Devendra Kumar Patel, Gopeshwar Narayan, Debapratim Kar Chowdhuri"
Expression of membrane proteins in the eyes of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster,25857784,10.1016/bs.mie.2014.12.012,"In recent years, improved protein expression and crystallization strategies, as well as advanced synchrotron radiation sources and crystallographic tools considerably increased the number of crystal structures of integral membrane proteins from higher eukaryotes. However, seen as a proportion of the total number of candidate proteins, these achievements still appear meager, reflecting the huge effort that is often required to obtain high-level and functional expression of eukaryotic membrane proteins. Besides bacteria, yeast, insect, or mammalian cells are frequently used for heterologous expression, but despite considerable investments in time, labor, and money, there are numerous drawbacks to these systems. Are there other strategies that allow for an effective, large-scale production of functional membrane proteins? This chapter describes the expression of proteins in photoreceptor cells of transgenic Drosophila as an easily accessible, versatile alternative. We present step-by-step protocols starting from the cloning of the target gene into a suitable vector for fly eye expression and ending with the harvest of transgenic Drosophila and subsequent protein purification from the eye. Our examples span a number of eukaryotic membrane proteins from different classes-including receptors, transporters, channels, and enzymes-that were successfully expressed without further optimization.

The present study tested whether feeding flies with frozen yeast rather than with fresh yeast could have some effect on these traits, the other components of the food being similar in the two groups. Freezing altered live yeast quality and flies feeding on frozen yeast lived slightly less (males), were less fecund at older ages, and poorly resisted to some severe stresses (cold and starvation), no negative effect being observed on resistance to heat. It seems that, like in humans, feeding on a low quality food can negatively impact healthspan and that an appropriate food is not only a food with optimal number of calories and appropriate ratios of proteins, carbohydrates, and fat.",2015,"Eric Le Bourg, Tiphaine Gauthier, HervÃ© Colinet, Eric Le Bourg, Tiphaine Gauthier, HervÃ© Colinet"
A Drosophila Gustatory Receptor Required for Strychnine Sensation,26187906,10.1093/chemse/bjv038,"Strychnine is a potent, naturally occurring neurotoxin that effectively protects plants from animal pests by deterring feeding behavior. In insects, such as the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, bitter-tasting aversive compounds are detected primarily through a family of gustatory receptors (GRs), which are expressed in gustatory receptor neurons. We previously described multiple GRs that eliminate the behavioral avoidance to all bitter compounds tested, with the exception of strychnine. Here, we report the identity of a strychnine receptor, referred to as GR47a. We generated a mutation in Gr47a and found that it eliminated strychnine repulsion and strychnine-induced action potentials. GR47a was narrowly tuned, as the responses to other avoidance compounds were unaffected in the mutant animals. This analysis supports an emerging model that Drosophila GRs fall broadly into two specificity classes-one class is comprised of core receptors that are broadly required, whereas the other class, which includes GR47a, consists of narrowly tuned receptors that define chemical specificity.",2015,"Youngseok Lee, Seok Jun Moon, Yijin Wang, Craig Montell, Youngseok Lee, Seok Jun Moon, Yijin Wang, Craig Montell"
No evidence that within-group male relatedness reduces harm to females in Drosophila,25750723,10.1002/ece3.1417,"Conflict between males and females over whether, when, and how often to mate often leads to the evolution of sexually antagonistic interactions that reduce female reproductive success. Because the offspring of relatives contribute to inclusive fitness, high relatedness between rival males might be expected to reduce competition and result in the evolution of reduced harm to females. A recent study investigated this possibility in Drosophila melanogaster and concluded that groups of brothers cause less harm to females than groups of unrelated males, attributing the effect to kin selection. That study did not control for the rearing environment of males, rendering the results impossible to interpret in the context of kin selection. Here, we conducted a similar experiment while manipulating whether males developed with kin prior to being placed with females. We found no difference between related and unrelated males in the harm caused to females when males were reared separately. In contrast, when related males developed and emerged together before the experiment, female reproductive output was higher. Our results show that relatedness among males is insufficient to reduce harm to females, while a shared rearing environment - resulting in males similar to or familiar with one another - is necessary to generate this pattern.",2015,"Brian Hollis, Tadeusz J Kawecki, Laurent Keller, Brian Hollis, Tadeusz J Kawecki, Laurent Keller"

Conservation of the ethanol-induced locomotor stimulant response among arthropods,25721420,10.1159/000370099,"Ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation has been variously described as reflective of the disinhibitory, euphoric, or reinforcing effects of ethanol and is commonly used as an index of acute ethanol sensitivity in rodents. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster also shows a locomotor stimulant response to ethanol that is believed to occur via conserved, ethanol-sensitive neurobiological mechanisms, but it is currently unknown whether this response is conserved among arthropod species or is idiosyncratic to D. melanogaster. The current experiments surveyed locomotor responses to ethanol in a phylogenetically diverse panel of insects and other arthropod species. A clear ethanol-induced locomotor stimulant response was seen in 9 of 13 Drosophilidae species tested, in 8 of 10 other species of insects, and in an arachnid (wolf spider) and a myriapod (millipede) species. Given the diverse phylogenies of the species that showed the response, these experiments support the hypothesis that locomotor stimulation is a conserved behavioral response to ethanol among arthropod species. Further comparative studies are needed to determine whether the specific neurobiological mechanisms known to underlie the stimulant response in D. melanogaster are conserved among arthropod and vertebrate species.",2015,"Christopher L Kliethermes, Christopher L Kliethermes"
KPNB1 mediates PER/CRY nuclear translocation and circadian clock function,26319354,10.7554/eLife.08647,"Regulated nuclear translocation of the PER/CRY repressor complex is critical for negative feedback regulation of the circadian clock of mammals. However, the precise molecular mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we report that KPNB1, an importin Î² component of the ncRNA repressor of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NRON) ribonucleoprotein complex, mediates nuclear translocation and repressor function of the PER/CRY complex. RNAi depletion of KPNB1 traps the PER/CRY complex in the cytoplasm by blocking nuclear entry of PER proteins in human cells. KPNB1 interacts mainly with PER proteins and directs PER/CRY nuclear transport in a circadian fashion. Interestingly, KPNB1 regulates the PER/CRY nuclear entry and repressor function, independently of importin Î±, its classical partner. Moreover, inducible inhibition of the conserved Drosophila importin Î² in lateral neurons abolishes behavioral rhythms in flies. Collectively, these data show that KPNB1 is required for timely nuclear import of PER/CRY in the negative feedback regulation of the circadian clock.",2015,"Yool Lee, A Reum Jang, Lauren J Francey, Amita Sehgal, John B Hogenesch, Yool Lee, A Reum Jang, Lauren J Francey, Amita Sehgal, John B Hogenesch"

We investigate the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon through a systems-level analysis of the gap gene network in the scuttle fly Megaselia abdita (Phoridae). It combines quantification of gene expression at high spatio-temporal resolution with systematic knock-downs by RNA interference (RNAi). Initiation and dynamics of gap gene expression differ markedly between M. abdita and Drosophila melanogaster, while the output of the system converges to equivalent patterns at the end of the blastoderm stage. Although the qualitative structure of the gap gene network is conserved, there are differences in the strength of regulatory interactions between species.

Using behavioral analysis, genetic manipulation, and live calcium imaging, we show that Gr68a-expressing neurons on the forelegs of male flies exhibit a sexually dimorphic physiological response to the pheromone and relay information to the central brain via peptidergic neurons. The release of tachykinin from 8 to 10 cells within the subesophageal zone is required for the pheromone-triggered courtship suppression.

Yet, Wolbachia abundance has been shown to vary greatly between individuals and the magnitude of the effects of infection on host life-history traits and protection against infection is correlated to within-host Wolbachia abundance. It is therefore essential to better understand the factors that modulate Wolbachia abundance and effects on host fitness. Nutrition is known to be one of the most important mediators of host-symbiont interactions. Here, we used nutritional geometry to quantify the role of macronutrients on insect-Wolbachia relationships in Drosophila melanogaster.

The Esg Gene Is Involved in Nicotine Sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster,26222315,10.1371/journal.pone.0133956,"In humans, there is a strong correlation between sensitivity to substances of abuse and addiction risk. This differential tolerance to drugs has a strong genetic component. The identification of human genetic factors that alter drug tolerance has been a difficult task. For this reason and taking advantage of the fact that Drosophila responds similarly to humans to many drugs, and that genetically it has a high degree of homology (sharing at least 70% of genes known to be involved in human genetic diseases), we looked for genes in Drosophila that altered their nicotine sensitivity. We developed an instantaneous nicotine vaporization technique that exposed flies in a reproducible way. The amount of nicotine sufficient to ""knock out"" half of control flies for 30 minutes was determined and this parameter was defined as Half Recovery Time (HRT). Two fly lines, L4 and L70, whose HRT was significantly longer than controlÂ´s were identified. The L4 insertion is a loss of function allele of the transcriptional factor escargot (esg), whereas L70 insertion causes miss-expression of the microRNA cluster miR-310-311-312-313 (miR-310c). In this work, we demonstrate that esg loss of function induces nicotine sensitivity possibly by altering development of sensory organs and neurons in the medial section of the thoracoabdominal ganglion. The ectopic expression of the miR-310c also induces nicotine sensitivity by lowering Esg levels thus disrupting sensory organs and possibly to the modulation of other miR-310c targets.",2015,"IvÃ¡n Sanchez-DÃ­az, Fernando Rosales-Bravo, JosÃ© Luis Reyes-Taboada, Alejandra A Covarrubias, VerÃ³nica Narvaez-Padilla, Enrique Reynaud, IvÃ¡n Sanchez-DÃ­az, Fernando Rosales-Bravo, JosÃ© Luis Reyes-Taboada, Alejandra A Covarrubias, VerÃ³nica Narvaez-Padilla, Enrique Reynaud"
Expression Divergence of Chemosensory Genes between Drosophila sechellia and Its Sibling Species and Its Implications for Host Shift,26430061,10.1093/gbe/evv183,"Drosophila sechellia relies exclusively on the fruits of Morinda citrifolia, which are toxic to most insects, including its sibling species Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans. Although several odorant binding protein (Obp) genes and olfactory receptor (Or) genes have been suggested to be associated with the D. sechellia host shift, a broad view of how chemosensory genes have contributed to this shift is still lacking. We therefore studied the transcriptomes of antennae, the main organ responsible for detecting food resource and oviposition, of D. sechellia and its two sibling species. We wanted to know whether gene expression, particularly chemosensory genes, has diverged between D. sechellia and its two sibling species. Using a very stringent definition of differential gene expression, we found a higher percentage of chemosensory genes differentially expressed in the D. sechellia lineage (7.8%) than in the D. simulans lineage (5.4%); for upregulated chemosensory genes, the percentages were 8.8% in D. sechellia and 5.2% in D. simulans. Interestingly, Obp50a exhibited the highest upregulation, an approximately 100-fold increase, and Or85c--previously reported to be a larva-specific gene--showed approximately 20-fold upregulation in D. sechellia. Furthermore, Ir84a (ionotropic receptor 84a), which has been proposed to be associated with male courtship behavior, was significantly upregulated in D. sechellia.

Dosage Compensation of X-Linked Muller Element F Genes but Not X-Linked Transgenes in the Australian Sheep Blowfly,26506426,10.1371/journal.pone.0141544,"In most animals that have X and Y sex chromosomes, chromosome-wide mechanisms are used to balance X-linked gene expression in males and females. In the fly Drosophila melanogaster, the dosage compensation mechanism also generally extends to X-linked transgenes. Over 70 transgenic lines of the Australian sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina have been made as part of an effort to develop male-only strains for a genetic control program of this major pest of sheep. All lines carry a constitutively expressed fluorescent protein marker gene. In all 12 X-linked lines, female larvae show brighter fluorescence than male larvae, suggesting the marker gene is not dosage compensated. This has been confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR for selected lines. To determine if endogenous X-linked genes are dosage compensated, we isolated 8 genes that are orthologs of genes that are on the fourth chromosome in D. melanogaster. Recent evidence suggests that the D. melanogaster fourth chromosome, or Muller element F, is the ancestral X chromosome in Diptera that has reverted to an autosome in Drosophila species. We show by quantitative PCR of male and female DNA that 6 of the 8 linkage group F genes reside on the X chromosome in L. cuprina. The other two Muller element F genes were found to be autosomal in L. cuprina, whereas two Muller element B genes were found on the same region of the X chromosome as the L. cuprina orthologs of the D. melanogaster Ephrin and gawky genes. We find that the L. cuprina X chromosome genes are equally expressed in males and females (i.e., fully dosage compensated). Thus, unlike in Drosophila, it appears that the Lucilia dosage compensation system is specific for genes endogenous to the X chromosome and cannot be co-opted by recently arrived transgenes.",2015,"Rebecca J Linger, Esther J Belikoff, Maxwell J Scott, Rebecca J Linger, Esther J Belikoff, Maxwell J Scott"

We also evaluated functioning of piRNA-machinery in the absence of major stress protein Hsp70 in this species. We analyzed the deep sequence data of piRNA expression after HS treatment and demonstrated that it modulates the expression of certain double-stranded germinal piRNA-clusters. Notable, we demonstrated significant changes in piRNA levels targeting a group of MEs after HS only in the strain containing normal set of hsp70 genes.

A Major Locus Controls a Genital Shape Difference Involved in Reproductive Isolation Between Drosophila yakuba and Drosophila santomea,26511499,10.1534/g3.115.023481,"Rapid evolution of genitalia shape, a widespread phenomenon in animals with internal fertilization, offers the opportunity to dissect the genetic architecture of morphological evolution linked to sexual selection and speciation.

We report the first genetic study of male genitalia evolution between D. yakuba and D. santomea, two species of the D. melanogaster species subgroup. We focus on male ventral branches, which harm females during interspecific copulation. Using landmark-based geometric morphometrics, we characterized shape variation in parental species, F1 hybrids, and backcross progeny and show that the main axis of shape variation within the backcross population matches the interspecific variation between parental species. For genotyping, we developed a new molecular method to perform multiplexed shotgun genotyping (MSG), which allowed us to prepare genomic DNA libraries from 365 backcross individuals in a few days using little DNA. We detected only three QTL, one of which spans 2.7 Mb and exhibits a highly significant effect on shape variation that can be linked to the harmfulness of the ventral branches.

dTRPA1 in Non-circadian Neurons Modulates Temperature-dependent Rhythmic Activity in Drosophila melanogaster,26868037,10.1177/0748730415627037,"In fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster, environmental cycles of light and temperature are known to influence behavioral rhythms through dedicated sensory receptors. But the thermosensory pathways and molecular receptors by which thermal cycles modulate locomotor activity rhythms remain unclear. Here, we report that neurons expressing warmth-activated ion channel Drosophila Transient Receptor Potential-A1 (dTRPA1) modulate distinct aspects of the rhythmic activity/rest rhythm in a light-dependent manner. Under light/dark (LD) cycles paired with constantly warm ambient conditions, flies deficient in dTRPA1 expression are unable to phase morning and evening activity bouts appropriately. Correspondingly, we show that electrical activity of a few neurons targeted by the dTRPA1(SH)-GAL4 driver modulates temperature-dependent phasing of activity/rest rhythm under LD cycles. The expression of dTRPA1 also affects behavior responses to temperature cycles combined with constant dark (DD) or light (LL) conditions. We demonstrate that the mid-day ""siesta"" exhibited by flies under temperature cycles in DD is dependent on dTRPA1 expression in a small number of neurons that include thermosensory anterior cell neurons. Although a small subset of circadian pacemaker neurons may express dTRPA1, we show that CRY-negative dTRPA1(SH)-GAL4 driven neurons are critical for the suppression of mid-thermophase activity, thus enabling flies to exhibit siesta. In contrast to temperature cycles in DD, under LL, dTRPA1 is not required for exhibiting siesta but is important for phasing of evening peak.

Drosophila Adaptation to Viral Infection through Defensive Symbiont Evolution,27684942,10.1371/journal.pgen.1006297,"Microbial symbionts can modulate host interactions with biotic and abiotic factors. Such interactions may affect the evolutionary trajectories of both host and symbiont. Wolbachia protects Drosophila melanogaster against several viral infections and the strength of the protection varies between variants of this endosymbiont. Since Wolbachia is maternally transmitted, its fitness depends on the fitness of its host. Therefore, Wolbachia populations may be under selection when Drosophila is subjected to viral infection. Here we show that in D. melanogaster populations selected for increased survival upon infection with Drosophila C virus there is a strong selection coefficient for specific Wolbachia variants, leading to their fixation. Flies carrying these selected Wolbachia variants have higher survival and fertility upon viral infection when compared to flies with the other variants. These findings demonstrate how the interaction of a host with pathogens shapes the genetic composition of symbiont populations. Furthermore, host adaptation can result from the evolution of its symbionts, with host and symbiont functioning as a single evolutionary unit.",2016,"Vitor G Faria, Nelson E Martins, Sara MagalhÃ£es, TÃ¢nia F Paulo, Viola Nolte, Christian SchlÃ¶tterer, ?lio Sucena, Luis Teixeira, Vitor G Faria, Nelson E Martins, Sara MagalhÃ£es, TÃ¢nia F Paulo, Viola Nolte, Christian SchlÃ¶tterer, ?lio Sucena, Luis Teixeira"
The origin of chromosomal inversions as a source of segmental duplications in the Sophophora subgenus of Drosophila,27470196,10.1038/srep30715,"Chromosomal inversions can contribute to the adaptation of organisms to their environment by capturing particular advantageous allelic combinations of a set of genes included in the inverted fragment and also by advantageous functional changes due to the inversion process itself that might affect not only the expression of flanking genes but also their dose and structure. Of the two mechanisms originating inversions -ectopic recombination, and staggered double-strand breaks and subsequent repair- only the latter confers the inversion the potential to have dosage effects and/or to generate advantageous chimeric genes. In Drosophila subobscura, there is ample evidence for the adaptive character of its chromosomal polymorphism, with an important contribution of some warm-climate arrangements such as E1+2+9+12. Here, we have characterized the breakpoints of inversion E12 and established that it originated through the staggered-break mechanism like four of the five inversions of D. subobscura previously studied. This mechanism that also predominates in the D. melanogaster lineage might be prevalent in the Sophophora subgenus and contribute to the adaptive character of the polymorphic and fixed inversions of its species. Finally, we have shown that the D. subobscura inversion breakpoint regions have generally been disrupted by additional structural changes occurred at different time scales.",2016,"Eva Puerma, Dorcas J Orengo, Montserrat AguadÃ©, Eva Puerma, Dorcas J Orengo, Montserrat AguadÃ©"

A Single Pair of Serotonergic Neurons Counteracts Serotonergic Inhibition of Ethanol Attraction in Drosophila,27936023,10.1371/journal.pone.0167518,"Attraction to ethanol is common in both flies and humans, but the neuromodulatory mechanisms underlying this innate attraction are not well understood. Here, we dissect the function of the key regulator of serotonin signaling-the serotonin transporter-in innate olfactory attraction to ethanol in Drosophila melanogaster. We generated a mutated version of the serotonin transporter that prolongs serotonin signaling in the synaptic cleft and is targeted via the Gal4 system to different sets of serotonergic neurons. We identified four serotonergic neurons that inhibit the olfactory attraction to ethanol and two additional neurons that counteract this inhibition by strengthening olfactory information. Our results reveal that compensation can occur on the circuit level and that serotonin has a bidirectional function in modulating the innate attraction to ethanol. Given the evolutionarily conserved nature of the serotonin transporter and serotonin, the bidirectional serotonergic mechanisms delineate a basic principle for how random behavior is switched into targeted approach behavior.",2016,"Li Xu, Jianzheng He, Andrea Kaiser, Nikolas GrÃ¤ber, Laura SchlÃ¤ger, Yvonne Ritze, Henrike Scholz, Li Xu, Jianzheng He, Andrea Kaiser, Nikolas GrÃ¤ber, Laura SchlÃ¤ger, Yvonne Ritze, Henrike Scholz"

By combining minimal photo-damage with high imaging speed and sample mounting tailored toward the needs of the specimen, it enables in toto imaging of embryogenesis with high spatial and temporal resolution. Drosophila embryos are particularly well suited for SPIM imaging because the volume of the embryo does not change from the single cell embryo to the hatching larva. SPIM microscopes can therefore image Drosophila embryos embedded in rigid media, such as agarose, from multiple angles every few minutes from the blastoderm stage until hatching.

Transdifferentiation and Proliferation in Two Distinct Hemocyte Lineages in Drosophila melanogaster Larvae after Wasp Infection,27414410,10.1371/journal.ppat.1005746,"Cellular immune responses require the generation and recruitment of diverse blood cell types that recognize and kill pathogens. In Drosophila melanogaster larvae, immune-inducible lamellocytes participate in recognizing and killing parasitoid wasp eggs. However, the sequence of events required for lamellocyte generation remains controversial. To study the cellular immune system, we developed a flow cytometry approach using in vivo reporters for lamellocytes as well as for plasmatocytes, the main hemocyte type in healthy larvae. We found that two different blood cell lineages, the plasmatocyte and lamellocyte lineages, contribute to the generation of lamellocytes in a demand-adapted hematopoietic process. Plasmatocytes transdifferentiate into lamellocyte-like cells in situ directly on the wasp egg. In parallel, a novel population of infection-induced cells, which we named lamelloblasts, appears in the circulation. Lamelloblasts proliferate vigorously and develop into the major class of circulating lamellocytes. Our data indicate that lamellocyte differentiation upon wasp parasitism is a plastic and dynamic process.

Measuring activity in olfactory receptor neurons in Drosophila: Focus on spike amplitude,27614176,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2016.09.003,"Olfactory responses at the receptor level have been thoroughly described in Drosophila melanogaster by electrophysiological methods. Single sensilla recordings (SSRs) measure neuronal activity in intact individuals in response to odors. For sensilla that contain more than one olfactory receptor neuron (ORN), their different spontaneous spike amplitudes can distinguish each signal under resting conditions. However, activity is mainly described by spike frequency. Some reports on ORN response dynamics studied two components in the olfactory responses of ORNs: a fast component that is reflected by the spike frequency and a slow component that is observed in the LFP (local field potential, the single sensillum counterpart of the electroantennogram, EAG). However, no apparent correlation was found between the two elements. In this report, we show that odorant stimulation produces two different effects in the fast component, affecting spike frequency and spike amplitude. Spike amplitude clearly diminishes at the beginning of a response, but it recovers more slowly than spike frequency after stimulus cessation, suggesting that ORNs return to resting conditions long after they recover a normal spontaneous spike frequency. Moreover, spike amplitude recovery follows the same kinetics as the slow voltage component measured by the LFP, suggesting that both measures are connected. These results were obtained in ab2 and ab3 sensilla in response to two odors at different concentrations. Both spike amplitude and LFP kinetics depend on odorant, concentration and neuron, suggesting that like the EAG they may reflect olfactory information.",2016,"Fernando Martin, Esther Alcorta, Fernando Martin, Esther Alcorta"
Rhodopsin 7-The unusual Rhodopsin in Drosophila,27651995,10.7717/peerj.2427,"Rhodopsins are the major photopigments in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.

Phylogenetic trees based on protein sequences suggest that the seven Drosophila Rhodopsins cluster in three different groups. While Rh1, Rh2 and Rh6 form a ""vertebrate-melanopsin-type""-cluster, and Rh3, Rh4 and Rh5 form an ""insect-type""-Rhodopsin cluster, Rh7 seem to form its own cluster.

"Identification of Bari Transposons in 23 Sequenced Drosophila Genomes Reveals Novel Structural Variants, MITEs and Horizontal Transfer",27213270,10.1371/journal.pone.0156014,"Bari elements are members of the Tc1-mariner superfamily of DNA transposons, originally discovered in Drosophila melanogaster, and subsequently identified in silico in 11 sequenced Drosophila genomes and as experimentally isolated in four non-sequenced Drosophila species. Bari-like elements have been also studied for their mobility both in vivo and in vitro. We analyzed 23 Drosophila genomes and carried out a detailed characterization of the Bari elements identified, including those from the heterochromatic Bari1 cluster in D. melanogaster. We have annotated 401 copies of Bari elements classified either as putatively autonomous or inactive according to the structure of the terminal sequences and the presence of a complete transposase-coding region. Analyses of the integration sites revealed that Bari transposase prefers AT-rich sequences in which the TA target is cleaved and duplicated. Furthermore evaluation of transposon's co-occurrence near the integration sites of Bari elements showed a non-random distribution of other transposable elements. We also unveil the existence of a putatively autonomous Bari1 variant characterized by two identical long Terminal Inverted Repeats, in D. rhopaloa. In addition, we detected MITEs related to Bari transposons in 9 species. Phylogenetic analyses based on transposase gene and the terminal sequences confirmed that Bari-like elements are distributed into three subfamilies. A few inconsistencies in Bari phylogenetic tree with respect to the Drosophila species tree could be explained by the occurrence of horizontal transfer events as also suggested by the results of dS analyses.

We show that so-called phosphomimetic mutants of the Drosophila regulatory light chain (RLC) do not mimic the phosphorylated RLC state in vitro.

"Identification and characterization of haemofungin, a novel antifungal compound that inhibits the final step of haem biosynthesis",26747101,10.1093/jac/dkv446,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      During recent decades, the number of invasive fungal infections among immunosuppressed patients has increased significantly, whereas the number of effective systemic antifungal drugs remains low and unsatisfactory. The aim of this study was to characterize a novel antifungal compound, CW-8/haemofungin, which we previously identified in a screen for compounds affecting fungal cell wall integrity.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      The in vitro characteristics of haemofungin were investigated by MIC evaluation against a panel of pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi, bacteria and mammalian cells in culture. Haemofungin mode-of-action studies were performed by screening an Aspergillus nidulans overexpression genomic library for resistance-conferring plasmids and biochemical validation of the target. In vivo efficacy was tested in the Galleria mellonella and Drosophila melanogaster insect models of infection.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We demonstrate that haemofungin causes swelling and lysis of growing fungal cells. It inhibits the growth of pathogenic Aspergillus, Candida, Fusarium and Rhizopus isolates at micromolar concentrations, while only weakly affecting the growth of mammalian cell lines. Genetic and biochemical analyses in A. nidulans and Aspergillus fumigatus indicate that haemofungin primarily inhibits ferrochelatase (HemH), the last enzyme in the haem biosynthetic pathway. Haemofungin was non-toxic and significantly reduced mortality rates of G. mellonella and D. melanogaster infected with A. fumigatus and Rhizopus oryzae, respectively.

A novel Drosophila model of TDP-43 proteinopathies: N-terminal sequences combined with the Q/N domain induce protein functional loss and locomotion defects,27101846,10.1242/dmm.023382,"Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43, also known as TBPH in Drosophila melanogaster and TARDBP in mammals) is the main protein component of the pathological inclusions observed in neurons of patients affected by different neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fronto-temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). The number of studies investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration is constantly growing; however, the role played by TDP-43 in disease onset and progression is still unclear. A fundamental shortcoming that hampers progress is the lack of animal models showing aggregation of TDP-43 without overexpression. In this manuscript, we have extended our cellular model of aggregation to a transgenic Drosophila line. Our fly model is not based on the overexpression of a wild-type TDP-43 transgene. By contrast, we engineered a construct that includes only the specific TDP-43 amino acid sequences necessary to trigger aggregate formation and capable of trapping endogenous Drosophila TDP-43 into a non-functional insoluble form. Importantly, the resulting recombinant product lacks functional RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and, thus, does not have specific TDP-43-physiological functions (i.e. splicing regulation ability) that might affect the animal phenotype per se. This novel Drosophila model exhibits an evident degenerative phenotype with reduced lifespan and early locomotion defects. Additionally, we show that important proteins involved in neuromuscular junction function, such as syntaxin (SYX), decrease their levels as a consequence of TDP-43 loss of function implying that the degenerative phenotype is a consequence of TDP-43 sequestration into the aggregates. Our data lend further support to the role of TDP-43 loss-of-function in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders.

We show that in Drosophila melanogaster, mild TZ defects are observed in the absence of MKS components. In contrast, Cby and Azi1 cooperate to build the TZ by acting upstream of Cep290 and MKS components. Without Cby and Azi1, centrioles fail to form the TZ, precluding sensory cilia assembly, and no ciliary membrane cap associated with sperm ciliogenesis is made. This ciliary cap is critical to recruit the tubulin-depolymerizing kinesin Klp59D, required for regulation of axonemal growth. Our results show that Drosophila TZ assembly in sensory neurons and male germ cells involves cooperative actions of Cby and Dila.

Arginine to glycine mutations do not induce significant changes in tryptophan fluorescence, and the mutated proteins form oligomers that are of equal or smaller size than the wild-type protein. They all form oligomer with one single peak as determined by size exclusion chromatography. While all mutants demonstrate the same efficiency as the DmHsp22WT in a DTT-induced insulin aggregation assay, all are more efficient chaperones to prevent aggregation of malate dehydrogenase. Arginine mutants of DmHsp22 are efficient chaperones to retard aggregation of CS and Luc. In summary, this study shows that mutations of arginine to glycine in DmHsp22 ACD induce a number of structural changes, some of which differ from those described in mammalian sHsps.

Complex Coding and Regulatory Polymorphisms in a Restriction Factor Determine the Susceptibility of Drosophila to Viral Infection,28630113,10.1534/genetics.117.201970,"It is common to find that major-effect genes are an important cause of variation in susceptibility to infection. Here we have characterized natural variation in a gene called pastrel that explains over half of the genetic variance in susceptibility to the Drosophila C virus (DCV) in populations of Drosophila melanogaster We found extensive allelic heterogeneity, with a sample of seven alleles of pastrel from around the world conferring four phenotypically distinct levels of resistance. By modifying candidate SNPs in transgenic flies, we show that the largest effect is caused by an amino acid polymorphism that arose when an ancestral threonine was mutated to alanine, greatly increasing resistance to DCV. Overexpression of the ancestral, susceptible allele provides strong protection against DCV; indicating that this mutation acted to improve an existing restriction factor. The pastrel locus also contains complex structural variation and cis-regulatory polymorphisms altering gene expression. We find that higher expression of pastrel is associated with increased survival after DCV infection. To understand why this variation is maintained in populations, we investigated genetic variation surrounding the amino acid variant that is causing flies to be resistant. We found no evidence of natural selection causing either recent changes in allele frequency or geographical variation in frequency, suggesting that this is an old polymorphism that has been maintained at a stable frequency.

Chronic exposure to dim artificial light at night decreases fecundity and adult survival in Drosophila melanogaster,28499591,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.04.009,"The presence of artificial light at night is expanding in geographical range and increasing in intensity to such an extent that species living in urban environments may never experience natural darkness. The negative ecological consequences of artificial night lighting have been identified in several key life history traits across multiple taxa (albeit with a strong vertebrate focus); comparable data for invertebrates is lacking. In this study, we explored the effect of chronic exposure to different night-time lighting intensities on growth, reproduction and survival in Drosophila melanogaster. We reared three generations of flies under identical daytime light conditions (2600lx) and one of four ecologically relevant ALAN treatments (0, 1, 10 or 100lx), then explored variation in oviposition, number of eggs produced, juvenile growth and survival and adult survival. We found that, in the presence of light at night (1, 10 and 100lx treatments), the probability of a female commencing oviposition and the number of eggs laid was significantly reduced. This did not translate into differences at the juvenile phase: juvenile development times and the probability of eclosing as an adult were comparable across all treatments. However, we demonstrate for the first time a direct link between chronic exposure to light at night (greater than 1lx) and adult survival. Our data highlight that ALAN has the capacity to cause dramatic shifts in multiple life history traits at both the individual and population level. Such shifts are likely to be species-specific, however a more in depth understanding of the broad-scale impact of ALAN and the relevant mechanisms driving biological change is urgently required as we move into an increasing brightly lit future.",2017,"L K McLay, M P Green, T M Jones, L K McLay, M P Green, T M Jones"

We find that two motor input types, Ib and Is, provide distinct forms of excitatory drive during crawling and differ in key transmission properties. Although both inputs vary in transmission probability, active Is synapses are more reliable. High-frequency firing ""wakes up"" silent Ib synapses and depresses Is synapses. Strikingly, homeostatic compensation in presynaptic strength only occurs at Ib synapses. This specialization is associated with distinct regulation of postsynaptic CaMKII.

The route of infection determines Wolbachia antibacterial protection in Drosophila,28592678,10.1098/rspb.2017.0809,"Bacterial symbionts are widespread among metazoans and provide a range of beneficial functions. Wolbachia-mediated protection against viral infection has been extensively demonstrated in Drosophila. In mosquitoes that are artificially transinfected with Drosophila melanogaster Wolbachia (wMel), protection from both viral and bacterial infections has been demonstrated. However, no evidence for Wolbachia-mediated antibacterial protection has been demonstrated in Drosophila to date. Here, we show that the route of infection is key for Wolbachia-mediated antibacterial protection. Drosophila melanogaster carrying Wolbachia showed reduced mortality during enteric-but not systemic-infection with the opportunist pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosaWolbachia-mediated protection was more pronounced in male flies and is associated with increased early expression of the antimicrobial peptide Attacin A, and also increased expression of a reactive oxygen species detoxification gene (Gst D8). These results highlight that the route of infection is important for symbiont-mediated protection from infection, that Wolbachia can protect hosts by eliciting a combination of resistance and disease tolerance mechanisms, and that these effects are sexually dimorphic. We discuss the importance of using ecologically relevant routes of infection to gain a better understanding of symbiont-mediated protection.",2017,"Vanika Gupta, Radhakrishnan B Vasanthakrishnan, Jonathon Siva-Jothy, Katy M Monteith, Sam P Brown, Pedro F Vale, Vanika Gupta, Radhakrishnan B Vasanthakrishnan, Jonathon Siva-Jothy, Katy M Monteith, Sam P Brown, Pedro F Vale"
Infection avoidance behavior: Viral exposure reduces the motivation to forage in female Drosophila melanogaster,27362557,10.1080/19336934.2016.1207029,"Infection avoidance behaviors are the first line of defense against pathogenic encounters. Behavioral plasticity in response to internal or external cues of infection can therefore generate potentially significant heterogeneity in infection. We tested whether Drosophila melanogaster exhibits infection avoidance behavior, and whether this behavior is modified by prior exposure to Drosophila C Virus (DCV) and by the risk of DCV encounter. We examined 2 measures of infection avoidance: (1) the motivation to seek out food sources in the presence of an infection risk and (2) the preference to land on a clean food source over a potentially infectious source. While we found no evidence for preference of clean food sources over potentially infectious ones, previously exposed female flies showed lower motivation to pick a food source when presented with a risk of encountering DCV. We discuss the relevance of behavioral plasticity during foraging for host fitness and pathogen spread.",2017,"Pedro F Vale, Michael D Jardine, Pedro F Vale, Michael D Jardine"
Metabolic and functional characterization of effects of developmental temperature in Drosophila melanogaster,27927623,10.1152/ajpregu.00268.2016,"The ability of ectotherms to respond to changes in their thermal environment through plastic mechanisms is central to their adaptive capability. However, we still lack knowledge on the physiological and functional responses by which ectotherms acclimate to temperatures during development, and in particular, how physiological stress at extreme temperatures may counteract beneficial acclimation responses at benign temperatures. We exposed Drosophila melanogaster to 10 developmental temperatures covering their entire permissible temperature range. We obtained metabolic profiles and reaction norms for several functional traits: egg-to-adult viability, developmental time, and heat and cold tolerance. Females were more heat tolerant than males, whereas no sexual dimorphism was found in cold tolerance. A group of metabolites, mainly free amino acids, had linear reaction norms. Several energy-carrying molecules, as well as some sugars, showed distinct inverted U-shaped norms of reaction across the thermal range, resulting in a positive correlation between metabolite intensities and egg-to-adult viability. At extreme temperatures, low levels of these metabolites were interpreted as a response characteristic of costs of homeostatic perturbations. Our results provide novel insights into a range of metabolites reported to be central for the acclimation response and suggest several new candidate metabolites. Low and high temperatures result in different adaptive physiological responses, but they also have commonalities likely to be a result of the failure to compensate for the physiological stress. We suggest that the regulation of metabolites that are tightly connected to the performance curve is important for the ability of ectotherms to cope with variation in temperature.",2017,"Mads F Schou, Torsten N Kristensen, Anders Pedersen, B GÃ¶ran Karlsson, Volker Loeschcke, Anders Malmendal, Mads F Schou, Torsten N Kristensen, Anders Pedersen, B GÃ¶ran Karlsson, Volker Loeschcke, Anders Malmendal"
Semi-automated quantitative Drosophila wings measurements,28659123,10.1186/s12859-017-1720-y,"Background:
      
    

    
      Drosophila melanogaster is an important organism used in many fields of biological research such as genetics and developmental biology. Drosophila wings have been widely used to study the genetics of development, morphometrics and evolution. Therefore there is much interest in quantifying wing structures of Drosophila. Advancement in technology has increased the ease in which images of Drosophila can be acquired. However such studies have been limited by the slow and tedious process of acquiring phenotypic data.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We have developed a system that automatically detects and measures key points and vein segments on a Drosophila wing. Key points are detected by performing image transformations and template matching on Drosophila wing images while vein segments are detected using an Active Contour algorithm. The accuracy of our key point detection was compared against key point annotations of users. We also performed key point detection using different training data sets of Drosophila wing images. We compared our software with an existing automated image analysis system for Drosophila wings and showed that our system performs better than the state of the art. Vein segments were manually measured and compared against the measurements obtained from our system.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our system was able to detect specific key points and vein segments from Drosophila wing images with high accuracy.",2017,"Sheng Yang Michael Loh, Yoshitaka Ogawa, Sara Kawana, Koichiro Tamura, Hwee Kuan Lee, Sheng Yang Michael Loh, Yoshitaka Ogawa, Sara Kawana, Koichiro Tamura, Hwee Kuan Lee"
Dendritic and Axonal L-Type Calcium Channels Cooperate to Enhance Motoneuron Firing Output during Drosophila Larval Locomotion,28986465,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1064-17.2017,"Behaviorally adequate neuronal firing patterns are critically dependent on the specific types of ion channel expressed and on their subcellular localization. This study combines in situ electrophysiology with genetic and pharmacological intervention in larval Drosophila melanogaster of both sexes to address localization and function of L-type like calcium channels in motoneurons. We demonstrate that Dmca1D (Cav1 homolog) L-type like calcium channels localize to both the somatodendritic and the axonal compartment of larval crawling motoneurons. In situ patch-clamp recordings in genetic mosaics reveal that Dmca1D channels increase burst duration and maximum intraburst firing frequencies during crawling-like motor patterns in semi-intact animals. Genetic and acute pharmacological manipulations suggest that prolonged burst durations are caused by dendritically localized Dmca1D channels, which activate upon cholinergic synaptic input and amplify EPSPs, thus indicating a conserved function of dendritic L-type channels from Drosophila to vertebrates. By contrast, maximum intraburst firing rates require axonal calcium influx through Dmca1D channels, likely to enhance sodium channel de-inactivation via a fast afterhyperpolarization through BK channel activation. Therefore, in unmyelinated Drosophila motoneurons different functions of axonal and dendritic L-type like calcium channels likely operate synergistically to maximize firing output during locomotion.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Nervous system function depends on the specific excitabilities of different types of neurons. Excitability is largely shaped by different combinations of voltage-dependent ion channels. Despite a high degree of conservation, the huge diversity of ion channel types and their differential localization pose challenges in assigning distinct functions to specific channels across species. We find a conserved role, from fruit flies to mammals, for L-type calcium channels in augmenting motoneuron excitability. As in spinal cord, dendritic L-type channels amplify excitatory synaptic input. In contrast to spinal motoneurons, axonal L-type channels enhance firing rates in unmyelinated Drosophila motoraxons. Therefore, enhancing motoneuron excitability by L-type channels seems an old strategy, but localization and interactions with other channels are tuned to species-specific requirements.",2017,"Dimitrios Kadas, Aylin Klein, Niklas Krick, Jason W Worrell, Stefanie Ryglewski, Carsten Duch, Dimitrios Kadas, Aylin Klein, Niklas Krick, Jason W Worrell, Stefanie Ryglewski, Carsten Duch"
Neuromodulation and Strategic Action Choice in Drosophila Aggression,28375770,10.1146/annurev-neuro-072116-031240,"In this review, I discuss current knowledge and outstanding questions on the neuromodulators that influence aggressive behavior of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. I first present evidence that Drosophila exchange information during an agonistic interaction and choose appropriate actions based on this information. I then discuss the influence of several biogenic amines and neuropeptides on aggressive behavior. One striking characteristic of neuromodulation is that it can configure a neural circuit dynamically, enabling one circuit to generate multiple outcomes. I suggest a consensus effect of each neuromodulatory molecule on Drosophila aggression, as well as effects of receptor proteins where relevant data are available. Lastly, I consider neuromodulation in the context of strategic action choices during agonistic interactions. Genetic components of neuromodulatory systems are highly conserved across animals, suggesting that molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling Drosophila aggression can shed light on neural principles governing action choice during social interactions.",2017,"Kenta Asahina, Kenta Asahina"
Natural and laboratory mutations in kuzbanian are associated with zinc stress phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster,28218276,10.1038/srep42663,"Organisms must cope with altered environmental conditions such as high concentrations of heavy metals. Stress response to heavy metals is mediated by the metal-responsive transcription factor 1 (MTF-1), which is conserved from Drosophila to humans. MTF-1 binds to metal response elements (MREs) and changes the expression of target genes. kuzbanian (kuz), a metalloendopeptidase that activates the evolutionary conserved Notch signaling pathway, has been identified as an MTF-1 target gene. We have previously identified a putatively adaptive transposable element in the Drosophila melanogaster genome, named FBti0019170, inserted in a kuz intron. In this work, we investigated whether a laboratory mutant stock overexpressing kuz is associated with zinc stress phenotypes. We found that both embryos and adult flies overexpressing kuz are more tolerant to zinc compared with wild-type flies. On the other hand, we found that the effect of FBti0019170 on zinc stress tolerance depends on developmental stage and genetic background. Moreover, in the majority of the genetic backgrounds analyzed, FBti0019170 has a deleterious effect in unpolluted environments in pre-adult stages.

Protective action of Omega-3 on paraquat intoxication in Drosophila melanogaster,28849990,10.1080/15287394.2017.1357345,"Paraquat (PQ) (1,1'-dimethyl-4-4'-bipyridinium dichloride) is the second most widely used herbicide worldwide; however, in countries different sales and distribution remain restricted. Chronic exposure to PQ leads to several diseases related to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions including myocardial failure, cancer, and neurodegeneration and subsequently death depending upon the dose level. The aim of this study was to examine if diet supplementation with eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA and DHA, omega-3 long-chain fatty acids) serves a protective mechanism against neuromuscular dysfunctions mediated by PQ using Drosophila melanogaster as a model with focus on mitochondrial metabolism. PQ ingestion (170 mg/kg b.w. for 3 d) resulted in a decreased life span and climbing ability in D. melanogaster. In the brain, PQ increased thioflavin fluorescence and reduced either 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) nuclei staining and neuronal nuclei protein (NeuN) positive neurons, indicating amyloid formation and neurodegenetation, respectively. In the thorax, PQ ingestion lowered citrate synthase activity and respiratory functions indicating a reduction in mitochondrial content. PQ elevated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) mRNA expression levels, indicative of high calcium influx from cytosol to mitochondrial matrix. In brain and thorax, PQ also increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and impaired acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Concomitant EPA/DHA ingestion (0.31/0.19 mg/kg b.w.) protected D. melanogaster against PQ-induced toxicity preserving neuromuscular function and slowing down the rate of aging. In brain and thorax, these omega-3 fatty acids inhibited excess H2O2 production and restored AChE activity. EPA/DHA delayed amyloid deposition in the brain, and restored low citrate synthase activity and respiratory functions in the thorax. The effects in the thorax were attributed to stimulated mRNA expression level of genes involved either in mitochondrial dynamics or biogenesis promoted by EPA/DHA: dynamin-related protein (DRP1), mitochondrial assembly regulatory factor (MARF), mitochondrial dynamin like GTPase (OPA1), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ coactivator 1Î± (PGC1Î±).

Wiring variations that enable and constrain neural computation in a sensory microcircuit,28530904,10.7554/eLife.24838,"Neural network function can be shaped by varying the strength of synaptic connections. One way to achieve this is to vary connection structure. To investigate how structural variation among synaptic connections might affect neural computation, we examined primary afferent connections in the Drosophila olfactory system. We used large-scale serial section electron microscopy to reconstruct all the olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons that target a left-right pair of glomeruli, as well as all the projection neurons (PNs) postsynaptic to these ORNs. We found three variations in ORN?PN connectivity. First, we found a systematic co-variation in synapse number and PN dendrite size, suggesting total synaptic conductance is tuned to postsynaptic excitability. Second, we discovered that PNs receive more synapses from ipsilateral than contralateral ORNs, providing a structural basis for odor lateralization behavior.

Molecular Affinity of Mabolo Extracts to an Octopamine Receptor of a Fruit Fly,29064449,10.3390/molecules22101677,"Essential oils extracted from plants are composed of volatile organic compounds that can affect insect behavior. Identifying the active components of the essential oils to their biochemical target is necessary to design novel biopesticides. In this study, essential oils extracted from Diospyros discolor (Willd.) were analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) to create an untargeted metabolite profile. Subsequently, a conformational ensemble of the Drosophila melanogaster octopamine receptor in mushroom bodies (OAMB) was created from a molecular dynamics simulation to resemble a flexible receptor for docking studies. GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of several metabolites, i.e. mostly aromatic esters. Interestingly, these aromatic esters were found to exhibit relatively higher binding affinities to OAMB than the receptor's natural agonist, octopamine. The molecular origin of this observed enhanced affinity is the ? -stacking interaction between the aromatic moieties of the residues and ligands. This strategy, computational inspection in tandem with untargeted metabolomics, may provide insights in screening the essential oils as potential OAMB inhibitors.",2017,"Francoise Neil D Dacanay, Ma Carmina Joyce A Ladra, Hiyas A Junio, Ricky B Nellas, Francoise Neil D Dacanay, Ma Carmina Joyce A Ladra, Hiyas A Junio, Ricky B Nellas"
Little effect of HSP90 inhibition on the quantitative wing traits variation in Drosophila melanogaster,27909948,10.1007/s10709-016-9940-z,"Drosophila wings have been a model system to study the effect of HSP90 on quantitative trait variation. The effect of HSP90 inhibition on environmental buffering of wing morphology varies among studies while the genetic buffering effect of it was examined in only one study and was not detected. Variable results so far might show that the genetic background influences the environmental and genetic buffering effect of HSP90. In the previous studies, the number of the genetic backgrounds used is limited. To examine the effect of HSP90 inhibition with a larger number of genetic backgrounds than the previous studies, 20 wild-type strains of Drosophila melanogaster were used in this study. Here I investigated the effect of HSP90 inhibition on the environmental buffering of wing shape and size by assessing within-individual and among-individual variations, and as a result, I found little or very weak effects on environmental and genetic buffering. The current results suggest that the role of HSP90 as a global regulator of environmental and genetic buffering is limited at least in quantitative traits.",2017,"Kazuo H Takahashi, Kazuo H Takahashi"
Microenvironmental autophagy promotes tumour growth,28077876,10.1038/nature20815,"As malignant tumours develop, they interact intimately with their microenvironment and can activate autophagy, a catabolic process which provides nutrients during starvation. How tumours regulate autophagy in vivo and whether autophagy affects tumour growth is controversial. Here we demonstrate, using a well characterized Drosophila melanogaster malignant tumour model, that non-cell-autonomous autophagy is induced both in the tumour microenvironment and systemically in distant tissues. Tumour growth can be pharmacologically restrained using autophagy inhibitors, and early-stage tumour growth and invasion are genetically dependent on autophagy within the local tumour microenvironment. Induction of autophagy is mediated by Drosophila tumour necrosis factor and interleukin-6-like signalling from metabolically stressed tumour cells, whereas tumour growth depends on active amino acid transport. We show that dormant growth-impaired tumours from autophagy-deficient animals reactivate tumorous growth when transplanted into autophagy-proficient hosts.

Myc suppresses tumor invasion and cell migration by inhibiting JNK signaling,28068320,10.1038/onc.2016.463,"Tumor metastasis, but not primary overgrowth, is the leading cause of mortality for cancer patients. During the past decade, Drosophila melanogaster has been well-accepted as an excellent model to address the intrinsic mechanism of different aspects of cancer progression, ranging from tumor initiation to metastasis. In a genetic screen performed in Drosophila, aiming to find novel modulators of tumor invasion, we identified the oncoprotein Myc as a negative regulator. While expression of Myc dramatically blocks tumor invasion and cell migration, loss of Myc promotes cell migration in vivo. The activity of Myc is further enhanced by the co-expression of its transcription partner Max. Mechanistically, we found Myc/Max directly upregulates the transcription of puc, which encodes an inhibitor of JNK signaling crucial for tumor invasion and cell migration. Furthermore, we demonstrated that human cMyc potently suppresses JNK-dependent cell invasion and migration in both Drosophila and lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. These findings provide novel molecular insights into Myc-mediated cancer progression and raise the noteworthy problem in therapeutic strategies as inhibiting Myc might conversely accelerate tumor metastasis.",2017,"X Ma, J Huang, Y Tian, Y Chen, Y Yang, X Zhang, F Zhang, L Xue, X Ma, J Huang, Y Tian, Y Chen, Y Yang, X Zhang, F Zhang, L Xue"
AmiD Is a Novel Peptidoglycan Amidase in Wolbachia Endosymbionts of Drosophila melanogaster,28824885,10.3389/fcimb.2017.00353,"Wolbachia endobacteria are obligate intracellular bacteria with a highly reduced genome infecting many arthropod and filarial species, in which they manipulate arthropod reproduction to increase their transmission and are essential for nematode development and survival.

Despite the ability to synthesize lipid II, Wolbachia from arthropods and nematodes have only a subset of genes encoding enzymes involved in the periplasmic processing of lipid II and peptidoglycan recycling, with arthropods having two more than nematodes. We functionally analyzed the activity of the putative cell wall hydrolase AmiD from the Wolbachia endosymbiont of Drosophila melanogaster, an enzyme not encoded by the nematode endobacteria. Wolbachia AmiD has Zn2+-dependent amidase activity and cleaves intact peptidoglycan, monomeric lipid II and anhydromuropeptides, substrates that are generated during bacterial growth.

D. melanogaster, which was observed on citrus, mates at its feeding site, whereas D. nigrospiracula, which is cactiphilic, mates on a non-resource-based male territory adjacent to its feeding site. In both species large male size is important for reproductive success. However, in D. melanogaster smaller males tended to be excluded from the breeding site and were therefore not among the pool of potential mates to which females were exposed. Sex ratios were biased toward females in both species, but the high frequency of female remating in D. nigrospiracula may have provided more mating opportunities for the males of this species.

Participation of Drosophila melanogaster alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in the detoxification of 1-pentene-3-ol and 1-pentene-3-one,3139586,10.1038/hdy.1988.93,"The participation of the ADH enzymes in the detoxification by D. melanogaster of 1-pentene-3-ol (also called pentenol) and its oxidized product, 1-pentene-3-one (usually known as ethyl-vinyl-ketone or pentenone) have been studied using the LR lines. For this purpose flies of AdhS AdhS (SS) and AdhF AdhF (FF) genotypes were independently pretreated with a 2 per cent isopropanol (2-propanol) solution and the survivors exposed to water, to a 0.0075 per cent pentenol solution or to a 0.00375 per cent pentenone solution. After one day in these solutions, the ability to tolerate both compounds was checked and the ADH activity of the surviving flies was measured and compared with those of control flies not pretreated with isopropanol. Additionally, the effects of pentenone on ADH enzymes have been studied by comparing them with those of acetone. Our results show that, in contrast to acetone, pentenone neither reduced significantly the ADH activity in vivo nor altered the normal proportion of ADH isozymes of either SS or FF flies. Our findings also demonstrate that the isopropanol pretreatment implied a considerable decrease in sensitivity not only to pentenol (60 and 91 per cent for SS and FF flies, respectively) but also to pentenone (72 and 80 per cent for SS and FF flies, respectively). After isopropanol pretreatment, FF flies continued exhibiting higher ADH activities than SS ones. However, FF pretreated flies displayed higher tolerance to pentenol and a similar tolerance to pentenone than SS animals. Our results suggest that pentenol (unsaturated secondary alcohol) and isopropanol (saturated secondary alcohol) may be detoxified by slightly different processes (both ADH-activity-dependent), and that pentenone could not be accumulated in the fly but transformed into another compound(s) by means of some ADH-independent mechanism(s).",1988,"J J Garrido, G Dorado, M Barbancho, J J Garrido, G Dorado, M Barbancho"

In males, the dsx locus represses the genes responsible for female sexual differentiation; male differentiation functions, not being repressed, are expressed. Conversely, in females, the dsx locus represses the genes involved in male sexual differentiation and the female sexual differentiation functions, not being repressed, are expressed. We have molecularly cloned the dsx locus by chromosomal walking and localized the gene within the cloned region by determining the positions of breakpoints of chromosomal rearrangements broken in dsx and in closely flanking regions. The dsx locus is about 40 kb in size. Its DNA is unique and appears to be organized in the same way in genomes of males and females. There is a developmentally and sexually regulated set of transcripts produced by the dsx locus. During the larval period, two sex-nonspecific dsx transcripts are produced. At the end of the larval period, these transcripts disappear and are replaced by a set of male-specific and female-specific transcripts. In adults, an additional male-specific transcript appears. Because genetic analysis has shown that transcription of the dsx locus must occur during the pupal period for proper sexual differentiation, we infer that the sex-specific transcripts seen during the pupal period correspond to the sex determination regulatory functions defined by mutational analysis.

Using an immunoscreen, we identified two mutations in the encoding gene that cause microvillar disorganization in developing rhabdomeres and disruption of the closely apposed membranes of adjacent cells. In accordance with the mutant phenotype, we have renamed this genetic locus chaoptic and the encoded glycoprotein, chaoptin. Immunoelectron microscopy indicates that chaoptin is distributed along the length of the microvillus. This localization and the morphological abnormalities in mutants support the hypothesis that chaoptin may mediate adhesion between closely apposed membranes. In principle, the immunoscreen utilized here can be used to identify mutations in any gene in Drosophila for which antibodies to the gene product are available.",1988,"D Van Vactor Jr, D E Krantz, R Reinke, S L Zipursky, D Van Vactor Jr, D E Krantz, R Reinke, S L Zipursky"

Argonaute2 attenuates active transcription by limiting RNA Polymerase II elongation in Drosophila melanogaster,30356106,10.1038/s41598-018-34115-1,"Increasing lines of evidence support that Argonaute2 (AGO2) harbors several nuclear functions in metazoa. In particular, Drosophila AGO2 modulates transcription of developmentally regulated genes; however, the molecular mechanisms behind AGO2 recruitment into chromatin and its function in transcription have not been deeply explored. In this study, we show that Drosophila AGO2 chromatin association depends on active transcription. In order to gain insight into how AGO2 controls transcription, we performed differential ChIP-seq analysis for RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) upon depletion of AGO2. Remarkably, we find specific accumulation of the elongating but not initiating form of Pol II after AGO2 knockdown, suggesting that AGO2 impairs transcription elongation. Finally, AGO2 also affects Negative Elongation Factor (NELF) chromatin association but not the Cyclin Dependent Kinase 9 (CDK9).

Developmental nicotine exposure affects larval brain size and the adult dopaminergic system of Drosophila melanogaster,29898654,10.1186/s12861-018-0172-6,"Background:
      
    

    
      Pregnant women may be exposed to nicotine if they smoke or use tobacco products, nicotine replacement therapy, or via e-cigarettes. Prenatal nicotine exposure has been shown to have deleterious effects on the nervous system in mammals including changes in brain size and in the dopaminergic system. The genetic and molecular mechanisms for these changes are not well understood. A Drosophila melanogaster model for these effects of nicotine exposure could contribute to faster identification of genes and molecular pathways underlying these effects. The purpose of this study was to determine if developmental nicotine exposure affects the nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster, focusing on changes to brain size and the dopaminergic system at two developmental stages.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We reared flies on control or nicotine food from egg to 3rd instar larvae or from egg to adult and determined effectiveness of the nicotine treatment. We used immunohistochemistry to visualize the whole brain and dopaminergic neurons, using tyrosine hydroxylase as the marker. We measured brain area, tyrosine hydroxylase fluorescence, and counted the number of dopaminergic neurons in brain clusters. We detected an increase in larval brain hemisphere area, a decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase fluorescence in adult central brains, and a decrease in the number of neurons in the PPM3 adult dopaminergic cluster. We tested involvement of DÎ±7, one of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits, and found it was involved in eclosion, as previously described, but not involved in brain size.

      We conclude that developmental nicotine exposure in Drosophila melanogaster affects brain size and the dopaminergic system. Prenatal nicotine exposure in mammals has also been shown to have effects on brain size and in the dopaminergic system.

Structures reveal opening of the store-operated calcium channel Orai,30160233,10.7554/eLife.36758,"The store-operated calcium (Ca2+) channel Orai governs Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane of many non-excitable cells in metazoans.

Well-defined electron density maps reveal that the pore is dramatically dilated on its cytosolic side in comparison to the slender closed pore. Cations and anions bind in different regions of the open pore, informing mechanisms for ion permeation and Ca2+ selectivity. Opening of the pore requires the release of cytosolic latches.

Cucurbitacin B acts a potential insect growth regulator by antagonizing 20-hydroxyecdysone activity,29205800,10.1002/ps.4817,"Background:
      
    

    
      20-Hydroxyecdysone (20E), a crucial insect steroid hormone, can bind to its cognate nuclear receptor composed of ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle (USP) to activate expression of 20E-response genes, enabling subsequent metamorphosis. In this study, we tried to find out which steroid-like compounds can block insect metamorphosis effectively and provide useful information for biopesticide study. For this purpose, we screened 126 steroid-like compounds for possible 20E antagonists using a dual-luciferase reporter assay with Drosophila melanogaster Kc and Bombyx mori Bm12 cells.
    

    
  


        Results:

Temporally specific engagement of distinct neuronal circuits regulating olfactory habituation in Drosophila,30576281,10.7554/eLife.39569,"Habituation is the process that enables salience filtering, precipitating perceptual changes that alter the value of environmental stimuli. To discern the neuronal circuits underlying habituation to brief inconsequential stimuli, we developed a novel olfactory habituation paradigm, identifying two distinct phases of the response that engage distinct neuronal circuits. Responsiveness to the continuous odor stimulus is maintained initially, a phase we term habituation latency and requires Rutabaga Adenylyl-Cyclase-depended neurotransmission from GABAergic Antennal Lobe Interneurons and activation of excitatory Projection Neurons (PNs) and the Mushroom Bodies. In contrast, habituation depends on the inhibitory PNs of the middle Antenno-Cerebral Track, requires inner Antenno-Cerebral Track PN activation and defines a temporally distinct phase. Collectively, our data support the involvement of Lateral Horn excitatory and inhibitory stimulation in habituation. These results provide essential cellular substrates for future analyses of the molecular mechanisms that govern the duration and transition between these distinct temporal habituation phases.

Triple-Helical DNA in Drosophila Heterochromatin,30477098,10.3390/cells7120227,"Polynucleotide chains obeying Watson-Crick pairing are apt to form non-canonical complexes such as triple-helical nucleic acids. From early characterization in vitro, their occurrence in vivo has been strengthened by increasing evidence, although most remain circumstantial particularly for triplex DNA. Here, different approaches were employed to specify triple-stranded DNA sequences in the Drosophila melanogaster chromosomes. Antibodies to triplex nucleic acids, previously characterized, bind to centromeric regions of mitotic chromosomes and also to the polytene section 59E of mutant strains carrying the brown dominant allele, indicating that AAGAG tandem satellite repeats are triplex-forming sequences. The satellite probe hybridized to AAGAG-containing regions omitting chromosomal DNA denaturation, as expected, for the intra-molecular triplex DNA formation model in which single-stranded DNA coexists with triplexes. In addition, Thiazole Orange, previously described as capable of reproducing results obtained by antibodies to triple-helical DNA, binds to AAGAG repeats in situ thus validating both detection methods. Unusual phenotype and nuclear structure exhibited by Drosophila correlate with the non-canonical conformation of tandem satellite arrays. From the approaches that lead to the identification of triple-helical DNA in chromosomes, facilities particularly provided by Thiazole Orange use may broaden the investigation on the occurrence of triplex DNA in eukaryotic genomes.",2018,"Eduardo Gorab, Eduardo Gorab"
Parallel clinal variation in the mid-day siesta of Drosophila melanogaster implicates continent-specific targets of natural selection,30180162,10.1371/journal.pgen.1007612,"Similar to many diurnal animals, Drosophila melanogaster exhibits a mid-day siesta that is more robust as ambient temperature rises, an adaptive response aimed at minimizing exposure to heat. Mid-day siesta levels are partly regulated by the thermosensitive splicing of a small intron (termed dmpi8) found in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the circadian clock gene period (per). Using the well-studied D. melanogaster latitudinal cline along the eastern coast of Australia, we show that flies from temperate populations sleep less during the day compared to those from tropical regions. We identified combinations of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3' UTR of per that yield several different haplotypes. The two most abundant of these haplotypes exhibit a reciprocal tropical-temperate distribution in relative frequency. Intriguingly, transgenic flies with the major tropical isoform manifest increased daytime sleep and reduced dmpi8 splicing compared to those carrying the temperate variant. Our results strongly suggest that for a major portion of D. melanogaster in Australia, thermal adaptation of daily sleep behavior included spatially varying selection on ancestrally derived polymorphisms in the per 3' UTR that differentially control dmpi8 splicing efficiency. Prior work showed that African flies from high altitudes manifest reduced mid-day siesta levels, indicative of parallel latitudinal and altitudinal adaptation across continents. However, geographical variation in per 3' UTR haplotypes was not observed for African flies, providing a compelling case for inter-continental variation in factors targeted by natural selection in attaining a parallel adaptation. We propose that the ability to calibrate mid-day siesta levels to better match local temperature ranges is a key adaptation contributing to the successful colonization of D. melanogaster beyond its ancestral range in the lowlands of Sub-Saharan Africa.",2018,"Yong Yang, Isaac Edery, Yong Yang, Isaac Edery"
In vitro transport of methotrexate by Drosophila Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein,30312334,10.1371/journal.pone.0205657,"Methotrexate (MTX) is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, immune suppressant and antimalarial drug. It is a substrate of several human ABC proteins that confer multidrug resistance to cancer cells and determine compartmentalization of a wide range of physiological metabolites and endo or xenobiotics, by their primary active transport across biological membranes. The substrate specificity and tissue distribution of these promiscuous human ABC transporters show a high degree of redundancy, providing robustness to these key physiological and pharmacological processes, such as the elimination of toxins, e.g. methotrexate from the body. A similar network of proteins capable of transporting methotrexate has been recently suggested to exist in Drosophila melanogaster. One of the key players of this putative network is Drosophila Multidrug-resistance Associated Protein (DMRP). DMRP has been shown to be a highly active and promiscuous ABC transporter, capable of transporting various organic anions. Here we provide the first direct evidence that DMRP, expressed alone in a heterologous system lacking other, potentially functionally overlapping D. melanogaster organic anion transporters, is indeed able to transport methotrexate. Our in vitro results support the hypothesized but debated role of DMRP in in vivo methotrexate excretion.",2018,"Agnes Karasik, AndrÃ¡s VÃ¡radi, FlÃ³ra Szeri, Agnes Karasik, AndrÃ¡s VÃ¡radi, FlÃ³ra Szeri"
Frequencies of chromosomal inversions in Drosophila melanogaster in Fukushima after the nuclear power plant accident,29420572,10.1371/journal.pone.0192096,"In order to investigate genetic impact of a large amount of radionuclides released by the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident in 2011, we surveyed 2,304 haploid genomes of Drosophila melanogaster collected in three localities in Fukushima in 2012 and 2013 for chromosomal inversions. No unique inversion was found in 298 genomes in 2012 and only two in 2,006 genomes in 2013. The observed frequencies were even lower than the long-term average frequency of unique inversions in Japan. The common cosmopolitan inversions were also examined in Fukushima, Kyoto, and Iriomote (Okinawa) in 2012. Among three samples in Fukushima, the flies in Iizaka, where environmental radiation level was the highest, showed the lowest frequency of In(2L)t, but the highest frequency of In(3R)P, contrary to the expectation of decreasing of their frequencies in higher polluted areas. These results suggest that, at this level of genetic analysis, Fukushima populations of D. melanogaster would not have been negatively impacted following the release of radionuclides. Transposable P-element mobility was not likely to induce DNA damage solely or synergistically with radioactivity, because their transposition activity was totally repressed in the Fukushima strains. However, it should be noted that, because of limitations in access to the exclusion zone, we could only sample the populations in areas of relatively low radioactive contamination (0.39-0.63 Î¼Sv/h).

Drosophila HUWE1 Ubiquitin Ligase Regulates Endoreplication and Antagonizes JNK Signaling During Salivary Gland Development,30261639,10.3390/cells7100151,"The HECT-type ubiquitin ligase HECT, UBA and WWE Domain Containing 1, (HUWE1) regulates key cancer-related pathways, including the Myc oncogene.

HUWE1 is evolutionarily conserved from Caenorhabditis elegance to Drosophila melanogaster and Humans. Here, we report that the Drosophila ortholog, dHUWE1 (CG8184), is an essential gene whose loss results in embryonic lethality and whose tissue-specific disruption establishes its regulatory role in larval salivary gland development. dHUWE1 is essential for endoreplication of salivary gland cells and its knockdown results in the inability of these cells to replicate DNA. Remarkably, dHUWE1 is a survival factor that prevents premature activation of JNK signaling, thus preventing the disintegration of the salivary gland, which occurs physiologically during pupal stages. This function of dHUWE1 is general, as its inhibitory effect is observed also during eye development and at the organismal level. Epistatic studies revealed that the loss of dHUWE1 is compensated by dMyc proeitn expression or the loss of dmP53. dHUWE1 is therefore a conserved survival factor that regulates organ formation during Drosophila development.",2018,"Yifat Yanku, Eliya Bitman-Lotan, Yaniv Zohar, Estee Kurant, Norman Zilke, Martin Eilers, Amir Orian, Yifat Yanku, Eliya Bitman-Lotan, Yaniv Zohar, Estee Kurant, Norman Zilke, Martin Eilers, Amir Orian"

Asobara tabida is a parasitoid, which mainly parasitizes Drosophila melanogaster and D. subobscura, the first species being able to resist to the parasitoid development while the second species is not. To parasitize resistant hosts, including D. melanogaster, A. tabida develops sticky eggs, which prevent encapsulation, but this virulence mechanism may be costly. Interindividual and interpopulation variation in the proportion of sticky eggs respectively allowed us to (i) artificially select and compare life-history traits of a virulent and a nonvirulent laboratory strain, and (ii) compare a virulent and a nonvirulent field strain, to investigate the hypothetical costs of virulence. We observed strong differences between the 2 laboratory strains. The nonvirulent strain invested fewer resources in reproduction and walked less than the virulent one but lived longer. Concerning the field strains, we observed that the nonvirulent strain had larger wings while the virulent one walked more and faster.

The patterns of changes during aging were notably different for these two social responses. Flies were initially closer in space and then became further apart. However, the pattern of change in response to dSO followed a more typical decline in performance, similarly to changes in locomotion. Interestingly, the increased social space of old parents, as well as their reduced performance in avoiding dSO, was passed on to their progeny, such that young adults adopted the behavioural characteristic of their old parents. While the response to social cues was inherited, the changes in locomotion were not. We were able to scale the changes in the social space of parents and their progeny by accelerating or decelerating the physiological process of aging by increasing temperatures and exposure to oxidative stress, or via caloric restriction, respectively.

Structure and transcription of the Drosophila mulleri alcohol dehydrogenase genes,2997730,10.1093/nar/13.19.6899,"The D. melanogaster Adh gene is transcribed from two different promoters; a proximal (larval) promoter is active during late embryonic and larval stages, and a distal (adult) promoter is active primarily in third instar larvae and in adult flies (1).

The temporal pattern of expression of Adh-1 and Adh-2 is similar to the expression of D. melanogaster Adh from the proximal and distal promoters (2,3,4). We are interested in the molecular basis for the pattern of Adh expression in the mulleri subgroup species and in the mechanism of the switch in Adh promoter utilization. For these reasons, we have studied the structure and transcription of the Adh locus of D. mulleri, a species of the mulleri subgroup. We show that the ADH-1 and ADH-2 proteins are expressed from two distinct genes separated by 2 kilobase pairs, and that Adh-1 and Adh-2 are transcribed in the expected temporal pattern. In addition, we find a pseudogene 1.2 kb upstream from Adh-2, which is transcribed in a temporal pattern similar to Adh-2.",1985,"J A Fischer, T Maniatis, J A Fischer, T Maniatis"
The effect of repeated microwave irradiation on the frequency of sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila melanogaster,3927161,10.1016/0165-1218(85)90112-0,"The effect of repeated microwave irradiation (2375 MHz, CW) on mutagenic changes in Drosophila melanogaster was investigated. Oregon-R males were exposed to sublethal doses of microwaves (15 W/cm2 for 60 min, 20 W/cm2 for 10 min, and 25 W/cm2 for 5 min) for 5 days. The Muller-5 cross was used to detect sex-linked recessive lethal mutations. 4 lethals were found in treated groups but their frequency was not significantly different from that of the control group. No cumulative effect of repeated exposures on the mortality of the treated males was observed; on the contrary, their mortality decreased with the number of exposures. Irradiation did not affect the sex ratio of the F1. A significant decrease in the number of F1 offspring was noted in the group exposed to the power density of 15 W/cm2. A negative thermal effect of microwaves on male germ cells was probably manifested by this long exposure.",1985,"F Marec, J OndrÃ¡cek, V Brunnhofer, F Marec, J OndrÃ¡cek, V Brunnhofer"
MiR-219 represses expression of dFMR1 in Drosophila melanogaster,30528775,10.1016/j.lfs.2018.12.008,"Aims:
      
    

    
      Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) plays a vital role in mRNA trafficking and translation inhibition to regulate the synthesis of local proteins in neuronal axons and dendritic terminals. However, there are no reports on microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation of FMRP levels in Drosophila. Here, we aimed to identify miRNAs regulating FMRP levels in Drosophila.
    

    
  


        Main methods:
      
    

    
      Using online software, we predicted and selected 11 miRNAs potentially acting on the Drosophila fragile X mental retardation 1 (dFMR1) transcript. These candidates were screened for modulation of dFMR1 transcript levels at the cellular level using a dual luciferase reporter system. In addition, we constructed a transgenic Drosophila model overexpressing miR-219 in the nervous system and quantified dFMRP by western blotting. The neuromuscular junction phenotype in the model was studied by immunofluorescence staining.
    

    
  


        Key findings:
      
    

    
      Among the 11 miRNAs screened, miR-219 and miR-960 reduced luciferase gene activity by binding to the 3'-UTR of the dFMR1 transcript. Mutation of the miR-219 or miR-960 binding sites on the transcript resulted in complete or partial elimination of the miRNA-induced repression. Western blots revealed that dFMRP expression was decreased in the miR-219 overexpression model (Elav>miR-219). Drosophila larvae overexpressing miR-219 showed morphological abnormalities at the neuromuscular junction (increased synaptic boutons and synaptic branches). This finding is consistent with some phenotypes observed in dfmr1 mutants.
    

    
  


        Significance:
      
    

    
      Our results suggest that miR-219 regulates dFMR1 expression in Drosophila and is involved in fragile X syndrome pathogenesis. Collectively, these findings expand the current understanding of miRNA-mediated regulation of target molecule-related functions.",2019,"Chao Wang, Liang Ge, Jianban Wu, Xuan Wang, Liudi Yuan, Chao Wang, Liang Ge, Jianban Wu, Xuan Wang, Liudi Yuan"
Larvae of Drosophila melanogaster exhibit transcriptional activation of immune response pathways and antimicrobial peptides during recovery from supercooling stress,30660665,10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.01.006,"The biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying insect cold acclimation prior to cold stress are relatively well explored, but the mechanisms linked to recovery and repair after cold stress have received much less attention. Here we focus on recovery from cold stress in the larvae of the vinegar fly (Drosophila melanogaster) that were exposed to two physiologically distinct cold stress situations: supercooling (S, survival > 95%) and freezing (F, survival < 10%), both at -5 Â°C. We analysed the metabolic and transcriptomic responses to cold stress via GC-MS/LC-MS and whole-genome microarrays, respectively. Both stresses (S and F) caused metabolic perturbations which were transient in supercooled larvae but deeper and irreversible in frozen larvae. Differential gene expression analysis revealed a clear disparity in responses to supercooling and freezing (less than 10% of DE genes overlapped between S and F larvae). Using GO term enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway mapping, we identified the stimulation of immune response pathways as a strong candidate mechanism for coping with supercooling. Supercooling caused complex transcriptional activation of innate immunity potential: from Lysozyme-mediated degradation of bacterial cell walls, recognition of pathogen signals, through phagocytosis and lysosomal degradation, Toll and Imd signaling, to upregulation of genes coding for different antimicrobial peptides. The transcriptomic response to freezing was instead dominated by degradation of macromolecules and death-related processes such as autophagy and apoptosis. Of the 45 upregulated DE genes overlapping in responses to supercooling and freezing, 26 were broadly ascribable to defense and repair functions.",2019,"TomÃ¡Å¡ ?t?tina, Rodolphe Poupardin, Martin Moos, Petr ?imek, Petr ?milauer, VladimÃ­r KoÅ¡tÃ¡l, TomÃ¡Å¡ ?t?tina, Rodolphe Poupardin, Martin Moos, Petr ?imek, Petr ?milauer, VladimÃ­r KoÅ¡tÃ¡l"
Mitochondrial fusion regulates lipid homeostasis and stem cell maintenance in the Drosophila testis,31160709,10.1038/s41556-019-0332-3,"The capacity of stem cells to self-renew or differentiate has been attributed to distinct metabolic states. A genetic screen targeting regulators of mitochondrial dynamics revealed that mitochondrial fusion is required for the maintenance of male germline stem cells (GSCs) in Drosophila melanogaster. Depletion of Mitofusin (dMfn) or Opa1 led to dysfunctional mitochondria, activation of Target of rapamycin (TOR) and a marked accumulation of lipid droplets. Enhancement of lipid utilization by the mitochondria attenuated TOR activation and rescued the loss of GSCs that was caused by inhibition of mitochondrial fusion. Moreover, constitutive activation of the TOR-pathway target and lipogenesis factor Sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) also resulted in GSC loss, whereas inhibition of SREBP rescued GSC loss triggered by depletion of dMfn. Our findings highlight a critical role for mitochondrial fusion and lipid homeostasis in GSC maintenance, providing insight into the potential impact of mitochondrial and metabolic diseases on the function of stem and/or germ cells.",2019,"Rafael SÃªnos Demarco, Bradley S Uyemura, Cecilia D'Alterio, D Leanne Jones, Rafael SÃªnos Demarco, Bradley S Uyemura, Cecilia D'Alterio, D Leanne Jones"
The mlpt/Ubr3/Svb module comprises an ancient developmental switch for embryonic patterning,30896406,10.7554/eLife.39748,"Small open reading frames (smORFs) encoding 'micropeptides' exhibit remarkable evolutionary complexity. Conserved peptides encoded by mille-pattes (mlpt)/polished rice (pri)/tarsal less (tal) are essential for embryo segmentation in Tribolium but, in Drosophila, function in terminal epidermal differentiation and patterning of adult legs. Here, we show that a molecular complex identified in Drosophila epidermal differentiation, comprising Mlpt peptides, ubiquitin-ligase Ubr3 and transcription factor Shavenbaby (Svb), represents an ancient developmental module required for early insect embryo patterning. We find that loss of segmentation function for this module in flies evolved concomitantly with restriction of Svb expression in early Drosophila embryos. Consistent with this observation, artificially restoring early Svb expression in flies causes segmentation defects that depend on mlpt function, demonstrating enduring potency of an ancestral developmental switch despite evolving embryonic patterning modes. These results highlight the evolutionary plasticity of conserved molecular complexes under the constraints of essential genetic networks.

A Single-Cell Level and Connectome-Derived Computational Model of the Drosophila Brain,30687056,10.3389/fninf.2018.00099,"Computer simulations play an important role in testing hypotheses, integrating knowledge, and providing predictions of neural circuit functions. While considerable effort has been dedicated into simulating primate or rodent brains, the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is becoming a promising model animal in computational neuroscience for its small brain size, complex cognitive behavior, and abundancy of data available from genes to circuits. Moreover, several Drosophila connectome projects have generated a large number of neuronal images that account for a significant portion of the brain, making a systematic investigation of the whole brain circuit possible. Supported by FlyCircuit (http://www.flycircuit.tw), one of the largest Drosophila neuron image databases, we began a long-term project with the goal to construct a whole-brain spiking network model of the Drosophila brain. In this paper, we report the outcome of the first phase of the project. We developed the Flysim platform, which (1) identifies the polarity of each neuron arbor, (2) predicts connections between neurons, (3) translates morphology data from the database into physiology parameters for computational modeling, (4) reconstructs a brain-wide network model, which consists of 20,089 neurons and 1,044,020 synapses, and (5) performs computer simulations of the resting state. We compared the reconstructed brain network with a randomized brain network by shuffling the connections of each neuron. We found that the reconstructed brain can be easily stabilized by implementing synaptic short-term depression, while the randomized one exhibited seizure-like firing activity under the same treatment. Furthermore, the reconstructed Drosophila brain was structurally and dynamically more diverse than the randomized one and exhibited both Poisson-like and patterned firing activities. Despite being at its early stage of development, this single-cell level brain model allows us to study some of the fundamental properties of neural networks including network balance, critical behavior, long-term stability, and plasticity.",2019,"Yu-Chi Huang, Cheng-Te Wang, Ta-Shun Su, Kuo-Wei Kao, Yen-Jen Lin, Chao-Chun Chuang, Ann-Shyn Chiang, Chung-Chuan Lo, Yu-Chi Huang, Cheng-Te Wang, Ta-Shun Su, Kuo-Wei Kao, Yen-Jen Lin, Chao-Chun Chuang, Ann-Shyn Chiang, Chung-Chuan Lo"
Time-restricted feeding restores muscle function in Drosophila models of obesity and circadian-rhythm disruption,31221967,10.1038/s41467-019-10563-9,"Pathological obesity can result from genetic predisposition, obesogenic diet, and circadian rhythm disruption. Obesity compromises function of muscle, which accounts for a majority of body mass. Behavioral intervention that can counteract obesity arising from genetic, diet or circadian disruption and can improve muscle function holds untapped potential to combat the obesity epidemic. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) subject to obesogenic challenges exhibits metabolic disease phenotypes in skeletal muscle; sarcomere disorganization, mitochondrial deformation, upregulation of Phospho-AKT level, aberrant intramuscular lipid infiltration, and insulin resistance. Imposing time-restricted feeding (TRF) paradigm in which flies were fed for 12 h during the day counteracts obesity-induced dysmetabolism and improves muscle performance by suppressing intramuscular fat deposits, Phospho-AKT level, mitochondrial aberrations, and markers of insulin resistance. Importantly, TRF was effective even in an irregular lighting schedule mimicking shiftwork.

Thermal acclimation of flies from three populations of Drosophila melanogaster fails to support the seasonality hypothesis,30975420,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.009,"In seasonal environments, natural selection should favor genotypes that acclimate to slow and predictable changes in temperature. Selective pressure for acclimation should be especially strong for animals that complete many generations per year, because seasonal warming or cooling causes offspring to experience different temperatures than their parents did. Here, we studied variation in acclimation capacity among three populations of Drosophila melanogaster. We used a reverse acclimation design to see whether developmental acclimation persisted throughout adulthood. Flies developed from fertilization to adulthood at either 16Â° or 26 Â°C. Then, flies either remained at the same temperature or moved to the other temperature for 7 days. We measured fecundity at seven temperatures ranging from 14Â° to 36Â°C. Genotypes from North Carolina and Vermont laid more eggs at 16 Â°C after spending the larval and adult stages at 16 Â°C, instead of 26 Â°C. In both populations, the benefit of acclimation to 16 Â°C during development was erased by acclimation to 26 Â°C during adulthood. In contrast to our prediction, genotypes from Indiana laid fewer eggs at 16 Â°C or 26 Â°C after developing at this temperature.

Germ Cell Lineage Homeostasis in Drosophila Requires the Vasa RNA Helicase,31484689,10.1534/genetics.119.302558,"The conserved RNA helicase Vasa is required for germ cell development in many organisms. In Drosophila melanogaster loss of PIWI-interacting RNA pathway components, including Vasa, causes Chk2-dependent oogenesis arrest. However, whether the arrest is due to Chk2 signaling at a specific stage and whether continuous Chk2 signaling is required for the arrest is unknown. Here, we show that absence of Vasa during the germarial stages causes Chk2-dependent oogenesis arrest. Additionally, we report the age-dependent decline of the ovariole number both in flies lacking Vasa expression only in the germarium and in loss-of-function vasa mutant flies. We show that Chk2 activation exclusively in the germarium is sufficient to interrupt oogenesis and to reduce ovariole number in aging flies. Once induced in the germarium, Chk2-mediated arrest of germ cell development cannot be overcome by restoration of Vasa or by downregulation of Chk2 in the arrested egg chambers. These findings, together with the identity of Vasa-associated proteins identified in this study, demonstrate an essential role of the helicase in the germ cell lineage maintenance and indicate a function of Vasa in germline stem cell homeostasis.",2019,"Zeljko Durdevic, Anne Ephrussi, Zeljko Durdevic, Anne Ephrussi"
Neuronal Gluconeogenesis Regulates Systemic Glucose Homeostasis in Drosophila melanogaster,30930040,10.1016/j.cub.2019.02.053,"Gluconeogenesis is a well-established metabolic process whereby glucose is generated from small carbon molecules in the liver and kidney to maintain blood glucose levels. Expression of gluconeogenic genes has been reported in other organs of mammals and insects, where their function is not yet known. In the fruit fly, one of the gluconeogenic genes, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6P) is exclusively expressed in the CNS. Using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based glucose sensor, we show that a small subset of neurons in the fly brain is capable of carrying out gluconeogenesis. Moreover, we find that G6P mutant flies exhibit low whole-body glucose levels within 24 h of food deprivation. This phenotype can be mimicked by silencing G6P neurons and rescued by experimentally controlled activation in the absence of G6P. These results indicate that neural activity of G6P neurons, but not glucose production per se, is critical for glucose homeostasis. Lastly, we observe that neuronal gluconeogenesis promotes anterograde neuropeptide distribution from the soma to axon terminals, suggesting that the generation of glucose facilitates neuropeptide transport. Together, our analysis reveals a novel role for gluconeogenesis in neuronal signaling.",2019,"Tetsuya Miyamoto, Hubert Amrein, Tetsuya Miyamoto, Hubert Amrein"
A high-fat diet impacts memory and gene expression of the head in mated female Drosophila melanogaster,30810797,10.1007/s00360-019-01209-9,"Obesity predisposes humans to a range of life-threatening comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Obesity also aggravates neural pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease, but this class of comorbidity is less understood. When Drosophila melanogaster (flies) are exposed to high-fat diet (HFD) by supplementing a standard medium with coconut oil, they adopt an obese phenotype of decreased lifespan, increased triglyceride storage, and hindered climbing ability. The latter development has been previously regarded as a potential indicator of neurological decline in fly models of neurodegenerative disease. Our objective was to establish the obesity phenotype in Drosophila and identify a potential correlation, if any, between obesity and neurological decline through behavioral assays and gene expression microarray. We found that mated female w1118 flies exposed to HFD maintained an obese phenotype throughout adult life starting at 7 days, evidenced by increased triglyceride stores, diminished life span, and impeded climbing ability. While climbing ability worsened cumulatively between 7 and 14 days of exposure to HFD, there was no corresponding alteration in triglyceride content. Microarray analysis of the mated female w1118 fly head revealed HFD-induced changes in expression of genes with functions in memory, metabolism, olfaction, mitosis, cell signaling, and motor function. Meanwhile, an Aversive Phototaxis Suppression assay in mated female flies indicated reduced ability to recall an entrained memory 6 h after training. Overall, our results support the suitability of mated female flies for examining connections between diet-induced obesity and nervous or neurobehavioral pathology, and provide many directions for further investigation.",2019,"Osvaldo Rivera, Lara McHan, Bridget Konadu, Sumitkumar Patel, Silvienne Sint Jago, Matthew E Talbert, Osvaldo Rivera, Lara McHan, Bridget Konadu, Sumitkumar Patel, Silvienne Sint Jago, Matthew E Talbert"
"DNA damage response and repair in perspective: Aedes aegypti, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens",31711518,10.1186/s13071-019-3792-1,"Background:
      
    

    
      The maintenance of genomic integrity is the responsibility of a complex network, denominated the DNA damage response (DDR), which controls the lesion detection and DNA repair. The main repair pathways are base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), mismatch repair (MMR), homologous recombination repair (HR) and non-homologous end joining repair (NHEJ). They correct double-strand breaks (DSB), single-strand breaks, mismatches and others, or when the damage is quite extensive and repair insufficient, apoptosis is activated.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      In this study we used the BLAST reciprocal best-hit methodology to search for DDR orthologs proteins in Aedes aegypti. We also provided a comparison between Ae. aegypti, D. melanogaster and human DDR network.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Our analysis revealed the presence of ATR and ATM signaling, including the H2AX ortholog, in Ae. aegypti. Key DDR proteins (orthologs to RAD51, Ku and MRN complexes, XP-components, MutS and MutL) were also identified in this insect. Other proteins were not identified in both Ae. aegypti and D. melanogaster, including BRCA1 and its partners from BRCA1-A complex, TP53BP1, PALB2, POLk, CSA, CSB and POLÎ². In humans, their absence affects DSB signaling, HR and sub-pathways of NER and BER. Seven orthologs not known in D. melanogaster were found in Ae. aegypti (RNF168, RIF1, WRN, RAD54B, RMI1, DNAPKcs, ARTEMIS).
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The presence of key DDR proteins in Ae. aegypti suggests that the main DDR pathways are functional in this insect, and the identification of proteins not known in D. melanogaster can help fill gaps in the DDR network. The mapping of the DDR network in Ae. aegypti can support mosquito biology studies and inform genetic manipulation approaches applied to this vector.",2019,"Maria Beatriz S Mota, Marcelo Alex Carvalho, Alvaro N A Monteiro, Rafael D Mesquita, Maria Beatriz S Mota, Marcelo Alex Carvalho, Alvaro N A Monteiro, Rafael D Mesquita"

Attachment of the blastoderm to the vitelline envelope affects gastrulation of insects,30918398,10.1038/s41586-019-1044-3,"During gastrulation, physical forces reshape the simple embryonic tissue to form the complex body plans of multicellular organisms1. These forces often cause large-scale asymmetric movements of the embryonic tissue2,3. In many embryos, the gastrulating tissue is surrounded by a rigid protective shell4. Although it is well-recognized that gastrulation movements depend on forces that are generated by tissue-intrinsic contractility5,6, it is not known whether interactions between the tissue and the protective shell provide additional forces that affect gastrulation. Here we show that a particular part of the blastoderm tissue of the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) tightly adheres in a temporally coordinated manner to the vitelline envelope that surrounds the embryo. This attachment generates an additional force that counteracts tissue-intrinsic contractile forces to create asymmetric tissue movements. This localized attachment depends on an Î±PS2 integrin (inflated), and the knockdown of this integrin leads to a gastrulation phenotype that is consistent with complete loss of attachment. Furthermore, analysis of another integrin (the Î±PS3 integrin, scab) in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) suggests that gastrulation in this organism also relies on adhesion between the blastoderm and the vitelline envelope. Our findings reveal a conserved mechanism through which the spatiotemporal pattern of tissue adhesion to the vitelline envelope provides controllable, counteracting forces that shape gastrulation movements in insects.",2019,"Stefan MÃ¼nster, Akanksha Jain, Alexander Mietke, Anastasios Pavlopoulos, Stephan W Grill, Pavel Tomancak, Stefan MÃ¼nster, Akanksha Jain, Alexander Mietke, Anastasios Pavlopoulos, Stephan W Grill, Pavel Tomancak"
Selection for Timing of Eclosion Results in Co-evolution of Temperature Responsiveness in Drosophila melanogaster,31608742,10.1177/0748730419877315,"Circadian rhythms in adult eclosion of Drosophila are postulated to be regulated by a pair of coupled oscillators: one is the master clock that is light sensitive and temperature compensated and the other that is a slave oscillator whose period is temperature sensitive and whose phase is reflected in the overt behavior. Within this framework, we reasoned that in populations of Drosophila melanogaster that have been artificially selected for highly divergent phases of eclosion rhythm, there may be changes in this network of the master-slave oscillator system, via changes in the temperature-sensitive oscillator and/or the coupling of the light- and temperature-sensitive oscillators. We used light/dark cycles in conjunction with different constant ambient temperatures and 2 different amplitudes of temperature cycles in an overall cool or warm temperature and analyzed phases, gate width, and normalized amplitude of the rhythms in each of these conditions. We found that the populations selected for eclosion in the morning (early flies) do not vary their phases with change in temperature regimes, whereas the populations selected for eclosion in the evening (late flies) show phase lability of up to ~5 h.

Elav-Mediated Exon Skipping and Alternative Polyadenylation of the Dscam1 Gene Are Required for Axon Outgrowth,31242415,10.1016/j.celrep.2019.05.083,"Many metazoan genes express alternative long 3' UTR isoforms in the nervous system, but their functions remain largely unclear. In Drosophila melanogaster, the Dscam1 gene generates short and long (Dscam1-L) 3' UTR isoforms because of alternative polyadenylation (APA). Here, we found that the RNA-binding protein Embryonic Lethal Abnormal Visual System (Elav) impacts Dscam1 biogenesis at two levels, including regulation of long 3' UTR biogenesis and skipping of an upstream exon (exon 19). MinION long-read sequencing confirmed the connectivity of this alternative splicing event to the long 3' UTR. Knockdown or CRISPR deletion of Dscam1-L impaired axon outgrowth in Drosophila. The Dscam1 long 3' UTR was found to be required for correct Elav-mediated skipping of exon 19.

Participation of the Serine Protease Jonah66Ci in the Drosophila Antinematode Immune Response,31182620,10.1128/IAI.00094-19,"Serine proteases and serine protease homologs form the second largest gene family in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Certain genes in the Jonah multigene family encoding serine proteases have been implicated in the fly antiviral immune response. Here, we report the involvement of Jonah66Ci in the Drosophila immune defense against Steinernema carpocapsae nematode infection. We find that Drosophila Jonah66Ci is upregulated in response to symbiotic (carrying the mutualistic bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophila) or axenic (lacking Xenorhabdus) Steinernema nematodes and is expressed exclusively in the gut of Drosophila larvae. Inactivation of Jonah66Ci provides a survival advantage to larvae against axenic nematodes and results in differential expression of Toll and Imd pathway effector genes, specifically in the gut. Also, inactivation of Jonah66Ci increases the numbers of enteroendocrine and mitotic cells in the gut of uninfected larvae, and infection with Steinernema nematodes reduces their numbers, whereas the numbers of intestinal stem cells are unaffected by nematode infection. Jonah66Ci knockdown further reduces nitric oxide levels in response to infection with symbiotic Steinernema nematodes. Finally, we show that Jonah66Ci knockdown does not alter the feeding rates of uninfected Drosophila larvae; however, infection with axenic Steinernema nematodes lowers larval feeding.

Comparative toxicity evaluation of graphene oxide (GO) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles on Drosophila melanogaster,31428565,10.1016/j.toxrep.2019.07.009,"Engineered nanomaterials consisting of multiple nanoparticles (NPs) are finding their use in fields as wide and diverse as medicine, environment, cosmetics, energy and electronics. However, health and environmental impacts of these NPs need to be discerned individually to understand their true toxicity. Due to the promising application of upcoming material like GO-ZnO nanocomposite, the toxicity of ZnO and GO NPs was evaluated and compared individually in our study. This study compares the toxicity of Graphene Oxide (GO) NPs and Zinc Oxide (ZnO) NPs synthesized by Green method and Chemical method on Drosophila melanogaster. The GO, Chemical ZnO and Green ZnO NPs were synthesized and characterized using SEM, HR-TEM, FT-IR, UV-vis, EDX, XRD and DLS studies. NPs were comparatively analyzed for their cytotoxic and neurotoxic behaviors using different assays like MTT assay, mortality rate, larval crawling and climbing assay, total protein content analysis for evaluating the toxic potential of each of these NPs at different concentrations of use. Green ZnO were found to be least cytotoxic while Chemical ZnO caused the most cell damage. GO were found to have intermediary cytotoxicity. However, a different trend was observed with neurotoxicity wherein Green ZnO reportedly affected the neuromuscular coordination the most, while GO was found to have the least affect. This study provided insights into the different toxic effects caused by GO and ZnO NPs on Drosophila as well as comparative toxic effects of Chemical vs Green ZnO NPs.",2019,"Kritika Sood, Jasreen Kaur, Harpreet Singh, Shailendra Kumar Arya, Madhu Khatri, Kritika Sood, Jasreen Kaur, Harpreet Singh, Shailendra Kumar Arya, Madhu Khatri"
Localization of Drosophila CENP-A to non-centromeric sites depends on the NuRD complex,31713634,10.1093/nar/gkz962,"Centromere function requires the presence of the histone H3 variant CENP-A in most eukaryotes. The precise localization and protein amount of CENP-A are crucial for correct chromosome segregation, and misregulation can lead to aneuploidy. To characterize the loading of CENP-A to non-centromeric chromatin, we utilized different truncation- and localization-deficient CENP-A mutant constructs in Drosophila melanogaster cultured cells, and show that the N-terminus of Drosophila melanogaster CENP-A is required for nuclear localization and protein stability, and that CENP-A associated proteins, rather than CENP-A itself, determine its localization. Co-expression of mutant CENP-A with its loading factor CAL1 leads to exclusive centromere loading of CENP-A whereas co-expression with the histone-binding protein RbAp48 leads to exclusive non-centromeric CENP-A incorporation. Mass spectrometry analysis of non-centromeric CENP-A interacting partners identified the RbAp48-containing NuRD chromatin remodeling complex. Further analysis confirmed that NuRD is required for ectopic CENP-A incorporation, and RbAp48 and MTA1-like subunits of NuRD together with the N-terminal tail of CENP-A mediate the interaction. In summary, our data show that Drosophila CENP-A has no intrinsic specificity for centromeric chromatin and utilizes separate loading mechanisms for its incorporation into centromeric and ectopic sites. This suggests that the specific association and availability of CENP-A interacting factors are the major determinants of CENP-A loading specificity.",2019,"Engin Demirdizen, Matthias Spiller-Becker, Arion FÃ¶rtsch, Alexander Wilhelm, Samuel Corless, Debora Bade, Andrea Bergner, Bernd Hessling, Sylvia Erhardt, Engin Demirdizen, Matthias Spiller-Becker, Arion FÃ¶rtsch, Alexander Wilhelm, Samuel Corless, Debora Bade, Andrea Bergner, Bernd Hessling, Sylvia Erhardt"
Oral clioquinol is effective in the treatment of a fly model of Candida systemic infection,30600560,10.1111/myc.12888,"Background:
      
    

    
      Clioquinol was used in the 1950s-1970s as antimicrobial but its oral formulations were withdrawn from the market due to suspected neurotoxicity. Currently, there is possibility of repositioning of oral clioquinol formulations.
    

    
  


        Objectives:
      
    

    
      To evaluate the antifungal activity and toxicological parameters of clioquinol and the other two 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives using alternative animal models and to study the interaction dynamic of clioquinol with Candida albicans.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      We used Toll-deficient Drosophila melanogaster to test the protective effect of 8-hydroxyquinolines against C. albicans infection. Toxicological parameters were investigated in chicken embryo. A mathematical model-based analysis of the time-kill data of clioquinol was performed to obtain pharmacodynamic characteristics.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Clioquinol fully protected D. melanogaster from the infection. The 8-hydroxyquinolines did not cause changes in opening of the beak and movement of the chicken embryo; however, clioquinol and compound 2 increased arterial pulsation. Compound 3 was lethal at 1 mg mL-1 . Effective concentration found in modelling indicated that clioquinol was highly effective against C. albicans (0.306 Î¼g mL-1 ) in easily achievable serum levels; clioquinol rapidly achieved kill rate reaching the maximum effect after 13 hours.

Distinct Roles of Broadly Expressed Repressors Support Dynamic Enhancer Action and Change in Time,31340149,10.1016/j.celrep.2019.06.063,"How broadly expressed repressors regulate gene expression is incompletely understood. To gain insight, we investigated how Suppressor of Hairless-Su(H)-and Runt regulate expression of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist short-gastrulation via the sog_Distal enhancer. A live imaging protocol was optimized to capture this enhancer's spatiotemporal output throughout the early Drosophila embryo, finding in this context that Runt regulates transcription initiation, Su(H) regulates transcription rate, and both factors control spatial expression. Furthermore, whereas Su(H) functions as a dedicated repressor, Runt temporally switches from repressor to activator. Our results demonstrate that broad repressors play temporally distinct roles and contribute to dynamic gene expression. Both Run and Su(H)'s ability to influence the spatiotemporal domains of gene expression may serve to counterbalance activators and function in this manner as important regulators of the maternal-to-zygotic transition in early embryos.",2019,"Theodora Koromila, Angelike Stathopoulos, Theodora Koromila, Angelike Stathopoulos"
An EGFR-Induced Drosophila Lung Tumor Model Identifies Alternative Combination Treatments,31217165,10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-19-0168,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality. Mutations in the EGFR gene are among the most important inducers of lung tumor development, but success of personalized therapies is still limited because of toxicity or developing resistances. We expressed constitutively active EGFR (EGFRCA) exclusively in the airway system of Drosophila melanogaster and performed comprehensive phenotyping. Ectopic expression of EGFRCA induced massive hyper- and metaplasia, leading to early death. We used the lethal phenotype as a readout and screened a library of FDA-approved compounds and found that among the 1,000 compounds, only the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) afatinib, gefitinib, and ibrutinib rescued lethality in a whole-animal screening approach. Furthermore, we screened the library in the presence of a subtherapeutic afatinib dose and identified bazedoxifene as a synergistically acting compound that rescues EGFR-induced lethality. Our findings highlight the potential of Drosophila-based whole-animal screening approaches not only to identify specific EGFR inhibitors but also to discover compounds that act synergistically with known TKIs.

Assessing the Architecture of Drosophila mojavensis Locomotor Evolution with Bulk Segregant Analysis,30926724,10.1534/g3.119.400036,"Behavior is frequently predicted to be especially important for evolution in novel environments. If these predictions are accurate, there might be particular patterns of genetic architecture associated with recently diverged behaviors. Specifically, it has been predicted that behaviors linked to population divergence should be underpinned by a few genes of relatively large effect, compared to architectures of intrapopulation behavioral variation, which is considered to be highly polygenic. More mapping studies of behavioral variation between recently diverged populations are needed to continue assessing the generality of these predictions. Here, we used a bulk segregant mapping approach to dissect the genetic architecture of a locomotor trait that has evolved between two populations of the cactophilic fly Drosophila mojavensis We created an F8 mapping population of 1,500 individuals from advanced intercross lines and sequenced the 10% of individuals with the highest and lowest levels of locomotor activity. Using three alternative statistical approaches, we found strong evidence for two relatively large-effect QTL that is localized in a region homologous to a region of densely packed behavior loci in Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting that clustering of behavior genes may display relatively deep evolutionary conservation. Broadly, our data are most consistent with a polygenic architecture, though with several loci explaining a high proportion of variation in comparison to similar behavioral traits. We further note the presence of several antagonistic QTL linked to locomotion and discuss these results in light of theories regarding behavioral evolution and the effect size and direction of QTL for diverging traits in general.",2019,"Kyle M Benowitz, Joshua M Coleman, Luciano M Matzkin, Kyle M Benowitz, Joshua M Coleman, Luciano M Matzkin"
Locomotor sensitization modulates voluntary self-administration of methamphetamine in Drosophila melanogaster,32833318,10.1111/adb.12963,"As complexities of addictive behaviors cannot be fully captured in laboratory studies, scientists use simple addiction-associated phenotypes and measure them in laboratory animals. Locomotor sensitization, characterized by an increased behavioral response to the same dose of the drug, has been extensively used to elucidate the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms of neuronal plasticity. However, to what extent it contributes to the development of addiction is not completely clear. We tested if the development of locomotor sensitization to methamphetamine affects voluntary self-administration, and vice versa, in order to investigate how two drug-associated phenotypes influence one another. In our study, we used the genetically tractable model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, and quantified locomotor sensitization and voluntary self-administration to methamphetamine using behavioral tests that were developed and adapted in our laboratory. We show that flies express robust locomotor sensitization to the second dose of volatilized methamphetamine, which significantly lowers preferential self-administration of methamphetamine. Naive flies preferentially self-administer food with methamphetamine over plain food. Exposing flies to volatilized methamphetamine after voluntary self-administration abolishes locomotor sensitization. We tested period null (per01 ) mutant flies and showed that they do not develop locomotor sensitization, nor do they show preferential self-administration of methamphetamine. Our results suggest that there may be partially overlapping neural circuitry that regulates the expression of locomotor sensitization and preferential self-administration to methamphetamine and that this circuitry requires a functional per gene.",2020,"Franka Rigo, Ana FiloÅ¡evi?, Milan Petrovi?, Katarina Jovi?, Rozi Andreti?

EYES ABSENT and TIMELESS integrate photoperiodic and temperature cues to regulate seasonal physiology in Drosophila,32541062,10.1073/pnas.2004262117,"Organisms possess photoperiodic timing mechanisms to detect variations in day length and temperature as the seasons progress. The nature of the molecular mechanisms interpreting and signaling these environmental changes to elicit downstream neuroendocrine and physiological responses are just starting to emerge. Here, we demonstrate that, in Drosophila melanogaster, EYES ABSENT (EYA) acts as a seasonal sensor by interpreting photoperiodic and temperature changes to trigger appropriate physiological responses. We observed that tissue-specific genetic manipulation of eya expression is sufficient to disrupt the ability of flies to sense seasonal cues, thereby altering the extent of female reproductive dormancy. Specifically, we observed that EYA proteins, which peak at night in short photoperiod and accumulate at higher levels in the cold, promote reproductive dormancy in female D. melanogaster Furthermore, we provide evidence indicating that the role of EYA in photoperiodism and temperature sensing is aided by the stabilizing action of the light-sensitive circadian clock protein TIMELESS (TIM). We postulate that increased stability and level of TIM at night under short photoperiod together with the production of cold-induced and light-insensitive TIM isoforms facilitate EYA accumulation in winter conditions. This is supported by our observations that tim null mutants exhibit reduced incidence of reproductive dormancy in simulated winter conditions, while flies overexpressing tim show an increased incidence of reproductive dormancy even in long photoperiod.",2020,"Antoine Abrieux, Yongbo Xue, Yao Cai, Kyle M Lewald, Hoang Nhu Nguyen, Yong Zhang, Joanna C Chiu, Antoine Abrieux, Yongbo Xue, Yao Cai, Kyle M Lewald, Hoang Nhu Nguyen, Yong Zhang, Joanna C Chiu"
Dysfunction of Oskyddad causes Harlequin-type ichthyosis-like defects in Drosophila melanogaster,31929524,10.1371/journal.pgen.1008363,"Prevention of desiccation is a constant challenge for terrestrial organisms. Land insects have an extracellular coat, the cuticle, that plays a major role in protection against exaggerated water loss. Here, we report that the ABC transporter Oskyddad (Osy)-a human ABCA12 paralog-contributes to the waterproof barrier function of the cuticle in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We show that the reduction or elimination of Osy function provokes rapid desiccation. Osy is also involved in defining the inward barrier against xenobiotics penetration. Consistently, the amounts of cuticular hydrocarbons that are involved in cuticle impermeability decrease markedly when Osy activity is reduced. GFP-tagged Osy localises to membrane nano-protrusions within the cuticle, likely pore canals. This suggests that Osy is mediating the transport of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) through the pore canals to the cuticle surface. The envelope, which is the outermost cuticle layer constituting the main barrier, is unaffected in osy mutant larvae. This contrasts with the function of Snu, another ABC transporter needed for the construction of the cuticular inward and outward barriers, that nevertheless is implicated in CHC deposition. Hence, Osy and Snu have overlapping and independent roles to establish cuticular resistance against transpiration and xenobiotic penetration. The osy deficient phenotype parallels the phenotype of Harlequin ichthyosis caused by mutations in the human abca12 gene. Thus, it seems that the cellular and molecular mechanisms of lipid barrier assembly in the skin are conserved during evolution.",2020,"Yiwen Wang, Michaela Norum, Kathrin Oehl, Yang Yang, Renata Zuber, Jing Yang, Jean-Pierre Farine, Nicole Gehring, Matthias FlÃ¶tenmeyer, Jean-FranÃ§ois Ferveur, Bernard Moussian, Yiwen Wang, Michaela Norum, Kathrin Oehl, Yang Yang, Renata Zuber, Jing Yang, Jean-Pierre Farine, Nicole Gehring, Matthias FlÃ¶tenmeyer, Jean-FranÃ§ois Ferveur, Bernard Moussian"
Isolation of stage-specific germ cells using FACS in Drosophila germarium,32423645,10.1016/bs.mcb.2020.02.003,"Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis is a versatile model system to address many fundamental questions of cell and developmental biology, such as stem cell biology, mitosis, meiosis or cell polarity. Many mutagenesis and powerful genetic tools have contributed massively to identify and dissect in vivo gene functions in a stage and tissue specific manner. However, the small number of germ cells during the early steps of oogenesis have hampered a systematic description of RNA and protein contents at each stage. We describe here a protocol for isolating and comparing two small subpopulations of cells in the ovary for the purpose of RNA sequence profiling. The method is based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of GFP- and RFP-labeled proteins that are expressed in distinct and mostly non-overlapping regions of the germline. We used a transgene expressing a GFP-tagged Bam protein driven by its own promoter, labeling specifically the mitotic region of the germarium. We also took advantage of the short-lived Wicked protein tagged with RFP and expressed under the nanos promoter to label the meiotic region. We generated flies expressing both markers and were able to sort enough cells from each region to extract total RNAs and small RNAs. Total RNA or small RNA extracted from sorted cells were then used to generate deep-sequencing libraries that show specificity toward each compartment. This method of isolating a very small number of cells and the data generated from comparing distinct cell populations within the germline should further our understanding of these conserved steps of oogenesis.",2020,"Ana Maria VallÃ©s, Jean-RenÃ© Huynh, Ana Maria VallÃ©s, Jean-RenÃ© Huynh"
Roles of C/EBP class bZip proteins in the growth and cell competition of Rp ('Minute') mutants in Drosophila,31909714,10.7554/eLife.50535,"Reduced copy number of ribosomal protein (Rp) genes adversely affects both flies and mammals. Xrp1 encodes a reportedly Drosophila-specific AT-hook, bZIP protein responsible for many of the effects including the elimination of Rp mutant cells by competition with wild type cells. Irbp18, an evolutionarily conserved bZIP gene, heterodimerizes with Xrp1 and with another bZip protein, dATF4. We show that Irbp18 is required for the effects of Xrp1, whereas dATF4 does not share the same phenotype, indicating that Xrp1/Irbp18 is the complex active in Rp mutant cells, independently of other complexes that share Irbp18. Xrp1 and Irbp18 transcripts and proteins are upregulated in Rp mutant cells by auto-regulatory expression that depends on the Xrp1 DNA binding domains and is necessary for cell competition. We show that Xrp1 is conserved beyond Drosophila, although under positive selection for rapid evolution, and that at least one human bZip protein can similarly affect Drosophila development.",2020,"Jorge Blanco, Jacob C Cooper, Nicholas E Baker, Jorge Blanco, Jacob C Cooper, Nicholas E Baker"
The larval optic nerve is required for the development of an identified serotonergic arborization in Drosophila melanogaster,7781904,10.1006/dbio.1995.1175,"The larval visual system in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster consists of two bilateral clusters of 12 photoreceptor cells.

This arborization is formed by processes from larval neurons born during embryogenesis. However, these neuronal processes do not reach their final destination, the larval optic center, until late in larval development. Using mutations that disrupt the connectivity and/or development of the larval photoreceptor cells, as well as mosaic analysis, we demonstrate that the innervation of the larval optic center by this serotonergic arborization depends upon contact with the larval optic nerve.",1995,"M Mukhopadhyay, A R Campos, M Mukhopadhyay, A R Campos"

Immunoreactivity is first observed in embryonic neural tissue in a cluster of cells in the subesophageal ganglion and immunoreactive fibers projecting from these cells to the brain and ventral ganglion. This pattern of expression is also observed in neural tissue dissected from larva, pupa, and adult. Double-labelling experiments indicate that cells recognized by SDNFM-antisera are also stained with FMRFamide antisera. Based on position, SDNFMRFamide immunoreactive material is expressed in a limited number of cells that contain the FMRFamide polypeptide precursor.

The protein encoded by the cDNA, termed dTFIIF30, was synthesized in Escherichia coli and purified to greater than 95% homogeneity. In reconstituted transcription reactions with purified basal factors, the specific activity of dTFIIF30 was identical to that of its human homologue. Moreover, a carboxyl-terminal fragment, designated dF30(119-276), which contains the carboxyl-terminal 158 amino acid residues of dTFIIF30, was found to possess approximately 50% of the transcriptional activity as full-length dTFIIF30.

"Dissociation of photoreceptors from whole heads of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster",7781044,10.1007/BF00307821,"Photoreceptor cells that were mostly free of extracellular material and suitable for most electrophysiological study procedures were dissociated from whole heads of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, by a simple ""smash"" technique employing gentle chopping by a razor blade through Parafilm sheets. A variety of commonly available proteolytic and glycolytic digestion enzymes were tested as additions to the basic dissociation procedure described. With the aid of Nomarski interference contrast optics, periodic acid-Schiff staining, and fluorescent labeling and microscopy methods, it was determined that proteolytic enzymatic digestion does little to enhance the dissociation procedure, and instead, often damages the cells that one is attempting to recover. Unexpectedly, certain glycolytic enzymes, when added to the basic procedure, appear to enhance the recovery of intact viable Drosophila photoreceptors that are stripped of most extracellular material. Based on these results, a hypothesis concerning the biochemical nature of the extracellular matrix of the Drosophila retina is proposed. Drosophila photoreceptors are an interesting model system for the study of invertebrate phototransduction and photoreceptor cell biology because of their many well-characterized mutant strains.

Establishment of Drosophila imaginal precursor cells is controlled by the Arrowhead gene,8582291,,"Metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster requires synchronization of numerous developmental events that occur in isolated imaginal precursor tissues. The imaginal primordia are established during embryonic stages and are quiescent for much of larval life. The Arrowhead gene is necessary for establishment of proper numbers of cells within a subset of imaginal precursor tissues. Loss-of-function mutations in Arrowhead reduce the number of abdominal histoblasts and salivary gland imaginal ring cells before the proliferative stages of their development. The number of abdominal histoblasts in mutant animals is approximately half that of wild-type, as might result from failure of a single early division of these cells. A neomorphic Arrowhead allele results in the specific loss of the retinal precursors by the early third instar, before they have begun to differentiate. Since Arrowhead mutations affect only subsets of imaginal tissue, there must be distinctions in the developmental regulation of different imaginal precursors. Arrowhead may be part of a regulatory pathway responsible for establishing the proper number of abdominal histoblasts and salivary gland imaginal ring cells. The neomorphic Arrowhead allele, which may cause misexpression of the Arrowhead gene in the eye-antenna imaginal disc, interferes with the establishment or proliferation of retinal precursor cells.",1995,"J Curtiss, J S Heilig, J Curtiss, J S Heilig"
Simple plaque hybridization method for the detection of differentially represented repetitive DNA,7727126,,"A differential DNA hybridization method of detecting moderately repetitive strain-specific or species-specific DNA is described. Two Drosophila melanogaster strains, one with and one without transposable elements, were utilized as a model system to demonstrate the effectiveness of this procedure. A genomic library was constructed from flies of the pi 2 strain, which contains both P and hobo transposable elements. Duplicate plaque lifts of this library were probed with DNA from the same strain and with DNA from the Canton-S strain, which contains neither of these two families of transposable elements. Plaques that hybridized stronger to the genomic DNA that contained elements were noted, and then the filters were stripped and reprobed with P and hobo element DNA. Many of the differentially hybridizing plaques were shown to contain DNA homologous to one of the two known elements. This method should allow the isolation and cloning of any repetitive DNA present in one species or isolate, but absent or present in reduced copy number in another species or isolate. By analogy to the recent invasion of D. melanogaster by P elements, such differentially represented DNA is likely to represent recently invading transposable elements that are actively mobile.",1995,"G A Meister, R A Lansman, T A Grigliatti, G A Meister, R A Lansman, T A Grigliatti"
Malathion resistance levels in sympatric populations of Drosophila simulans (Diptera: Drosophilidae) and D. melanogaster differ by two orders of magnitude,7593892,10.1093/jee/88.5.1138,"Malathion resistance levels were determined in populations of the sympatric species Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) and Drosophila simulans (Sturtevant) from a collection site in Tampa Bay, FL, with a 20+ yr history of intensive malathion exposure. Bioassays of insecticide resistance were done by using a desiccation technique that reduces both the effects of avoidance behavior on the results and the total time of the assay. Resistance levels in isofemale lines of D. simulans are as much as 2 orders of magnitude higher than those in the D. melanogaster lines and are significantly higher than any previously reported resistance levels for organophosphate exposure in Drosophila sp. Comparison with specimens from additional collection sites in the region indicates that the normal ratio of these sympatric species has been altered at our study site. The use of Drosophila sp. as a model system to study resistance management strategies and differences in the evolution of insecticide resistance among sympatric species is discussed.",1995,"M Windelspecht, R C Richmond, B J Cochrane"
Genetic characterization of geographic populations using morphometrical traits in Drosophila melanogaster: isogroups versus isofemale lines,8522161,10.1007/BF01439574,"Studies of short or medium range geographic variations play an increasing role in ecological genetics, and sensitive techniques are required to detect them. In this respect, two sampling techniques were compared in D. melanogaster. The biological data were provided by the analysis of four natural populations from the same geographic area, Spain (one) and Southern France (three), for four morphometrical traits: abdomen and thoracic pigmentation, and wing and thorax lengths. Traits were measured on wild living females and on their progeny reared in the laboratory at 25 degrees C. For progeny analyses, two techniques were compared: the usual isofemale line technique, sib families issued from a single female, and a new isogroup technique, the progeny produced by a group of 20 wild-collected parents. Large phenotypic variations were observed in wild living flies, corresponding to the unstability of natural environmental conditions during their development. Among laboratory grown flies, variations were much smaller. Between isogroups, differences were small, due to sampling error and some common environment effects. Variations between lines were much greater, thus demonstrating a strong genetic component. When different populations have to be compared, the isogroup technique should be preferred since, for the same amount of work, the lesser variability between groups provides a more precise characterization of the population means.",1995,"B Moreteau, P Capy, A Alonso-Moraga, A Munoz-Serrano, J Stockel, J R David, B Moreteau, P Capy, A Alonso-Moraga, A Munoz-Serrano, J Stockel, J R David"
"Identification of homeotic target genes in Drosophila melanogaster including nervy, a proto-oncogene homologue",7498738,,"In Drosophila, the specific morphological characteristics of each segment are determined by the homeotic genes that regulate the expression of downstream target genes. We used a subtractive hybridization procedure to isolate activated target genes of the homeotic gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx). In addition, we constructed a set of mutant genotypes that measures the regulatory contribution of individual homeotic genes to a complex target gene expression pattern. Using these mutants, we demonstrate that homeotic genes can regulate target gene expression at the start of gastrulation, suggesting a previously unknown role for the homeotic genes at this early stage. We also show that, in abdominal segments, the levels of expression for two target genes increase in response to high levels of Ubx, demonstrating that the normal down-regulation of Ubx in these segments is functional. Finally, the DNA sequence of cDNAs for one of these genes predicts a protein that is similar to a human proto-oncogene involved in acute myeloid leukemias. These results illustrate potentially general rules about the homeotic control of target gene expression and suggest that subtractive hybridization can be used to isolate interesting homeotic target genes.",1995,"P G Feinstein, K Kornfeld, D S Hogness, R S Mann, P G Feinstein, K Kornfeld, D S Hogness, R S Mann"

Accumulation of the protein in males is first detected with polyclonal antibodies at 1 day after eclosion. The level of the protein in virgin males reaches a peak 5-8 days post-eclosion, and remains constant for at least 20 days. Upon mating the amount of Acp76A in males drops dramatically, but recovers by 24 h after mating. Immediately after mating the Acp76A is found in the female uterus.

Multiple TAFIIs directing synergistic activation of transcription,8525367,10.1126/science.270.5243.1783,"Coordinate activation of transcription by multiple enhancer binding factors is essential for the regulation of pattern formation during development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cell-free transcription reactions are described that recapitulate transcriptional synergism directed by the Drosophila developmental regulators Bicoid (BCD) and Hunchback (HB). Within the basal transcription factor complex TFIID, two specific targets, TAFII110 and TAFII60, served as coactivators to mediate transcriptional activation by these two enhancer binding proteins. A quadruple complex containing TATA binding protein (TBP), TAFII250, TAFII110, and TAFII60 mediated transcriptional synergism by BCD and HB, whereas triple TBP-TAFII complexes lacking one or the other target coactivator failed to support synergistic activation. Deoxyribonuclease I footprint protection experiments revealed that an integral step leading to transcriptional synergism involves the recruitment of TBP-TAFII complexes to the promoter by way of multivalent contacts between activators and selected TAFIIs. Thus, the concerted action of multiple regulators with different coactivators helps to establish the pattern and level of segmentation gene transcription during Drosophila development.",1995,"F Sauer, S K Hansen, R Tjian, F Sauer, S K Hansen, R Tjian"

A D. virilis pdm cDNA clone was isolated and sequenced. It shares sequence similarity with just the POU domain region of pdm-1, but shares extensive sequence similarity with the largest exon of pdm-2. In situ hybridization to D. virilis embryos shows that virtually all aspects of pdm-2 expression are conserved between D. virilis and D. melanogaster. This includes initial expression in a gap gene-like posterior domain, expression in ectodermal stripes during germ band extension, broad expression in the neurectoderm followed by limitation to discrete subsets of CNS cells, and expression in specific PNS neurons and support cells. The conservation of these expression domains supports the idea that the pdm genes are important for a variety of cell fate decisions in Drosophila development.",1995,"S J Poole, S J Poole"

The analysis of the distribution of nucleosome-free gaps on newly replicated DNA has revealed some structural details about the maturation of nucleosomes and provides direct evidence that parental nucleosomes have an altered structure at the replication fork. Finally, these stretches of nonnucleosomal chromatin are located in a trans disposition inside the active replicon, although there exists a considerable variability.",1995,"J PiÃ±ol, O CabrÃ©, J PiÃ±ol, O CabrÃ©"

The sequence comparison between D. subobscura and D. melanogaster shows an irregular distribution of the conserved and diverged regions, with the homeobox and a putative activating domain completely conserved. Comparisons of the promoter sequence and pattern of expression of the gene during development suggest that the regulation of zen has been conserved during evolution. The conservation of zen expression in a subpopulation of the polar cells indicates the existence of an important role in such cells. We describe a transitory segmented pattern of expression of zen in both species, suggesting the existence of interactions with a pair rule gene. Some indirect clues indicate that the z2 gene might be absent from the D. subobscura genome. A chromosome walk initiated to reach the proboscipedia gene of D. subobscura reveals that the distance between pb and zen is at least four times the one described for D. melanogaster and for D. pseudoobscura.

Work shown here provides evidence that an analogous signaling pathway exists in Drosophila melanogaster. Because many of the ligand-receptor pairs in Drosophila have not been fully characterized, it was necessary to bypass the receptor stimulation event that normally triggers intracellular Jak/Stat activation. This was done by treating Drosophila Schneider 2 cells with vanadate/peroxide, which has been shown to closely mimic some signaling events triggered by interferon gamma, including the activation of Jak1, Jak2, and the Stat1 alpha protein. Evidence presented here demonstrates that vanadate/peroxide can induce a gamma response region binding complex in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells. This complex contains two phosphoproteins of 100 and 150 kDa, respectively, and shares many features with the vanadate/peroxide-stimulated binding complex in the mammalian system.

Conserved alternative splicing patterns and splicing signals in the Drosophila sodium channel gene para,8536968,,"We cloned genomic DNA corresponding to the Drosophila virilis homologue of para, a gene encoding a sodium channel alpha-subunit, and obtained many partial cDNA clones from embryos and adults.

Among 31 different splice-types observed in D. virilis, the stage-specific pattern of alternative splicing seen in D. melanogaster is also conserved. Comparison of genomic DNA sequence revealed three aspects that vary between alternatively and constitutively used exon sequences. Sixteen short blocks (10-75 bp), the only recognizably conserved intron sequence, were disproportionately associated with alternatively used splice sites. Silent site substitutions were found much less frequently in alternative than constitutive exon elements, and the degree of match to the Drosophila splice site consensus tended to be lower at less frequently selected alternative splice junctions. This study shows that the developmentally regulated variability of para products is highly conserved and therefore likely to be of functional significance and suggests that a variety of different sequence-dependent mechanisms may regulate this pattern of alternative splicing.",1995,"J R Thackeray, B Ganetzky, J R Thackeray, B Ganetzky"

Consistent with this result, we show that OTD protein is expressed in a graded fashion across the disc primordia of these structures and that different threshold levels of OTD are required for the formation of specific subdomains of the head.

Main-cell products are also involved in elevating the rate of female egg-laying, in reducing female receptivity to further matings and in removing or destroying sperm of previous mates. The cost of mating to females may therefore represent a side-effect of evolutionary conflict between males.",1995,"T Chapman, L F Liddle, J M Kalb, M F Wolfner, L Partridge, T Chapman, L F Liddle, J M Kalb, M F Wolfner, L Partridge"

About 60 kb of DNA sequence has been isolated following a bidirectional chromosomal walk that extends over the cytogenetic interval 14C1-6. The breakpoints of chromosomal aberrations identified within that walk establish that the entire mei-41 gene has been cloned. Two independently derived mei-41 mutants have been shown to carry P insertions within a single 2.2 kb fragment of the walk. Since revertants of those mutants have lost the P element sequences, an essential region of the mei-41 gene is present in that fragment. A 10.5 kb genomic fragment that spans the P insertion sites has been found to restore methyl methanesulfonate resistance and female fertility of the mei-41D3 mutants. The results demonstrate that all the sequences required for the proper expression of the mei-41 gene are present on this genomic fragment.

P-element-induced male recombination can be produced in Drosophila melanogaster by combining end-deficient elements in trans,7789763,,"Male recombination, not normally present in Drosophila melanogaster, can be produced at high rates when target P elements at homologous sites are combined in the presence of transposase protein. We have produced a set of elements by in situ deletion of a particular insertion and have found elements that have deletions stretching into either end. Elements were tested in pairs to see whether they complement each other in their ability to induce recombination. The combination of elements that are deficient for the same end produces very little recombination, but the combination of a right-end and a left-end element can generate recombination values higher than given by two complete P[CaSpeR] elements at homologous sites. This strongly suggests that ""hybrid"" P elements, containing ends from two different elements, can be recognized by transposase protein. We have also examined genotypes containing a normal and an end-deficient element and found that they yield reasonably high levels of recombination. We interpret the resultant gametes from such genotypes as showing that the majority of events in this genotype derive from the association of complementary ends from the same element, whereas the complementary ends from elements in trans associate in only a minority of cases.",1995,"Y H Svoboda, M K Robson, J A Sved, Y H Svoboda, M K Robson, J A Sved"

Mesoderm-specific B104 expression requires the activity of the mesoderm-determining factors twist and snail. Virtually the same expression patterns were observed in Drosophila yakuba, a species that a separated from D. melanogaster by some 15 million years of evolution. We show that B104 expression is directed by internal sequences of the retrotransposon that are capable of acting as a cis-acting regulatory element in front of a heterologous Drosophila promoter. Our findings suggest that retrotransposon insertions can affect the expression patterns of endogenous genes by adding and distributing specific cis-acting control elements throughout the host genome.

A approximately 3.9 kilobase cDNA clone encoding the putative full-length myosin-IA gene product was isolated from an early embryonic library. Its deduced amino acid sequence predicts a protein of 1011 residues (117,094 Da) with a typical although highly basic myosin head, a neck composed of two IQ motifs, and a unique tail.

Preferential deadenylation of Hsp70 mRNA plays a key role in regulating Hsp70 expression in Drosophila melanogaster,7515148,10.1128/mcb.14.6.3646,"Following a standard heat shock, approximately 40% of Hsp70 transcripts in Drosophila melanogaster lack a poly(A) tail. Since heat shock disrupts other aspects of RNA processing, this observation suggested that heat might disrupt polyadenylation as well. We find, however, that as the temperature is increased a larger fraction of Hsp70 RNA is polyadenylated. Poly(A)-deficient Hsp70 RNAs arise not from a failure in polyadenylation but from the rapid and selective removal of poly(A) from previously adenylated transcripts. Poly(A) removal is highly regulated: poly(A) is (i) removed much more rapidly from Hsp70 RNAs than from Hsp23 RNAs, (ii) removed more rapidly after mild heat shocks than after severe heat shocks, and (iii) removed more rapidly after a severe heat shock if cells have first been conditioned by a mild heat treatment. Poly(A) seems to be removed by simple deadenylation rather than by endonucleolytic cleavage 5' of the adenylation site. During recovery from heat shock, deadenylation is rapidly followed by degradation. In cells maintained at high temperatures, however, the two processes are uncoupled and Hsp70 RNAs are deadenylated without being degraded. These deadenylated mRNAs are translated with low efficiency. Deadenylation therefore allows Hsp70 synthesis to be repressed even when degradation of the mRNA is blocked. Poly(A) tail shortening appears to play a key role in regulating Hsp70 expression.",1994,"R P Dellavalle, R Petersen, S Lindquist, R P Dellavalle, R Petersen, S Lindquist"

A crucial step for obtaining homogeneous enzyme preparations was affinity chromatography on Cibacron Blue Sepharose coupled with specific elution with NAD. Each of the isozymes is a dimer with subunit molecular weight of approximately 27 kDa. Both isozymes show a pH optimum of 9.6. ADH-1 proved to be immunochemically similar to ADH-2 when tested by Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against ADH-1.

Ultrastructural examination of the insemination reaction in Drosophila,8137397,10.1007/BF00318816,"The insemination reaction is a swelling of the female vagina caused by the male ejaculate.

Based on ultrastructural examination of the vaginal contents of five Drosophila species (D. mettleri, D. nigrospiracula, D. melanogaster, D. mojavensis, and D. hexastigma), we propose three terms to describe these vaginal structures: the sperm sac, the mating plug, and the true insemination reaction.

The data reveal that gene conversion is a mechanism responsible for the transfer of genetic information between naturally occurring inversions of Drosophila. The estimated rate of gene transfer by gene conversion at this region, which is close to an inversion breakpoint, is lower than previous estimates obtained experimentally at the rosy (ry) gene in Drosophila melanogaster. Our data indicate that gene arrangements OST and O3 + 4 are monophyletic and rather old (0.58 and 0.73 million years old, respectively).",1994,"J Rozas, M AguadÃ©, J Rozas, M AguadÃ©"
Expression of Drosophila melanogaster F elements in vivo,7816022,10.1007/BF00283262,"Drosophila melanogaster F elements are mobile, oligo(A)-terminated DNA sequences that probably propagate by the retrotranscription of RNA intermediates. Polyadenylated transcripts corresponding in size to full-length (4.7 kb) family members were detected in the Drosophila melanogaster Canton-S strain from 2nd larval instar to the adult stage. RNA accumulation reached a maximum in pupae. In the adult, F elements are transcribed in both sexes. F expression is directed in vivo by the intragenic promoter (Fin) located at the 5' end of F. Whole-mount hybridizations were carried out to define the site of synthesis of full-length transcripts found in the ovary. Selective RNA accumulation was not detected in the cytoplasm of any specific cell type. Stained nuclear dots were observed in nurse cells from stage 2-3 to the end of oogenesis. RNase treatment of egg chambers prior to the addition of the probe led to disappearance of the nuclear dots and appearance of a cytoplasmic hybridization signal suggesting leakage of nuclear transcripts. Transgenic lines harbouring the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene under the control of the Fin promoter were obtained. In independent lines, CAT enzyme levels mirror the ontogenetic profile of F expression drawn from Northern RNA blotting data. An antisense promoter (Fout) that is located downstream from the Fin promoter and transcribe too bords the 5' end of F seems to be constitutively expressed in the fly.",1994,"G Minchiotti, C Contursi, F Graziani, G Gargiulo, P P Di Nocera, G Minchiotti, C Contursi, F Graziani, G Gargiulo, P P Di Nocera"
The Doc transposable element in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans: genomic distribution and transcription,7813908,10.1007/BF01435244,"The mobile element Doc is similar in structure and coding potential to the LINE families found in various organisms. In this paper, we analyze the insertional and structural polymorphism of this element and show that it appears to have a long evolutionary history in the genome of D. melanogaster. Like the family of I elements, the Doc family seems to display three types of elements: full length elements, defective members that have recently transposed and long since immobilized members common to each D. melanogaster strain. These three classes of Doc elements seem to be present in D. simulans, a closely related species to D. melanogaster. Furthermore, we show that Doc is transcribed as a polyadenylated RNA of about 5 kb in length, presumed to be a full length RNA. This transcript is present in different tissues and at different stages of Drosophila development. These results are compared with previous records on the chromosomal distribution of LINEs or other transposable element families.

The gene for Cdk5 consists of 4 exons separated by 3 short introns ranging in size from 61-160 bp. Northern blot analysis revealed a single mRNA of approximately 1.6 kb that is expressed at highest levels in the adult fly. The putative amino acid sequence for Drosophila Cdk5 predicts a protein with a mass of approximately 32 kDa that is 77% identical to its mammalian counter-parts.

We examined the complex array of internal structures of the embryonic Drosophila melanogaster head such as the sensory structures and nerves of the peripheral and stomatogastric nervous systems, and we used embryonic head mutations causing a lack of overlapping segment anlagen to unravel the segmental identity and the sequence of the neural elements.

This partial sequence, homologous to human CPE, CPM, and CPN, contained the conserved arginine and zinc binding domains. Similarities to the human enzymes were found with stretches that were equally divergent from the three vertebrate carboxypeptidases.

The 50-kDa primase subunit of Drosophila melanogaster DNA polymerase alpha. Molecular characterization of the gene and functional analysis of the overexpressed protein,7929411,,"The gene encoding the 50-kDa subunit of Drosophila melanogaster DNA polymerase alpha has been cloned. A comparison of the predicted polypeptide sequence of the Drosophila protein with the equivalent subunits from mouse and yeast suggests that they are closely related and defines three conserved regions which are likely to be important for enzyme activity. The expression patterns of both the 50-kDa protein and its transcript (a single RNA message of 1.6 kilobases) throughout development are consistent with a role of the protein in DNA replication. When overexpressed and purified the 50-kDa subunit displays DNA primase activity. The products of the reaction, mainly oligoribonucleotides 12-14 nucleotides in length, plus dimers and some trimers, are similar to those synthesized by either the intact DNA polymerase alpha, or the biochemically isolated primase heterodimer. The isolated primase also shows similar sensitivity to antibodies, magnesium and monovalent cations, and the same nucleotide requirements as complexed forms of the primase. The isolated subunit, however, is more thermally labile, suggesting a role for the additional subunits in DNA polymerase alpha in stabilizing the primase activity of the 50-kDa primase subunit.",1994,"C J Bakkenist, S Cotterill, C J Bakkenist, S Cotterill"
Isolation of chromosome-associated proteins from Drosophila melanogaster that bind a human centromeric DNA sequence,7962082,10.1083/jcb.127.5.1159,"The molecular mechanism involved in packaging centromeric heterochromatin is still poorly understood. CENP-B, a centromeric protein present in human cells, is though to be involved in this process. This is a DNA-binding protein that localizes to the central domain of the centromere of human and mouse chromosomes due to its association with the 17-bp CENP-B box sequence. We have designed a biochemical approach to search for functional homologues of CENP-B in Drosophila melanogaster. This strategy relies upon the use of DNA fragments containing the CENP-B box to identify proteins that specifically bind this sequence. Three polypeptides were isolated by nuclear protein extraction, followed by sequential ion exchange columns and DNA affinity chromatography. All three proteins are present in the complex formed after gel retardation with the human alphoid satellite DNA that contains the CENP-B box. Footprinting analysis reveals that the complex occupies both strands of the CENP-B box, although it is still unclear which of the polypeptides actually makes contact with the DNA. Localization of fluorescein-labeled proteins after microinjection into early Drosophila embryos shows that they associate with condensed chromosomes. Immunostaining of embryos with a polyclonal serum made against all three polypeptides also shows chromosomal localization throughout mitosis. During metaphase and anaphase the antigens appear to localize preferentially to centromeric heterochromatin. Immunostaining of neuroblasts chromosome spreads confirmed these results, though some staining of chromosomal arms is also observed. The data strongly suggests that the polypeptides we have identified are chromosomal binding proteins that accumulate mainly at the centromeric heterochromatin. Furthermore, DNA binding assays clearly indicate that they have a high specific affinity for the human CENP-B box. This would suggest that at least one of the three proteins isolated might be a functional homologue of the human CENP-B.",1994,"M C Avides, C E Sunkel, M C Avides, C E Sunkel"
Clonal analysis in hybrids between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,28305934,10.1007/BF00361105,"We have analysed the viability of cellular clones induced by mitotic recombination in Drosophila melanogaster/D. simulans hybrid females during larval growth. These clones contain a portion of either melanogaster or simulans genomes in homozygosity. Analysis has been carried out for the X and the second chromosomes, as well as for the 3L chromosome arm. Clones were not found in certain structures, and in others they appeared in a very low frequency. Only in abdominal tergites was a significant number of clones observed, although their frequency was lower than in melanogaster abdomens. The bigger the portion of the genome that is homozygous, the less viable is the recombinant melano-gaster/simulans hybrid clone. The few clones that appeared may represent cases in which mitotic recombination took place in distal chromosome intervals, so that the clones contained a small portion of either melanogaster or simulans chromosomes in homozygosity. Moreover, Lhr, a gene of D. simulans that suppresses the lethality of male and female melanogaster/simulans hybrids, does not suppress the lethality of the recombinant melanogaster/simulans clones. Thus, it appears that there is not just a single gene, but at least one per tested chromosome arm (and maybe more) that cause hybrid lethality. Therefore, the two species, D. melanogaster and D. simulans, have diverged to such a degree that the absence of part of the genome of one species cannot be substituted by the corresponding part of the genome of the other, probably due to the formation of co-adapted gene complexes in both species following their divergent evolution after speciation. The disruption of those coadapted gene complexes would cause the lethality of the recombinant hybrid clones.",1994,"Lucas Sanchez, BegoÃ±a Granadino, Luis Vicente, Lucas Sanchez, BegoÃ±a Granadino, Luis Vicente"

Genetic analysis of the brahma gene of Drosophila melanogaster and polytene chromosome subdivisions 72AB,7916308,,"The brahma gene is required for activation of the homeotic genes of the Antennapedia and bithorax complexes in Drosophila. We have isolated and characterized 21 mutations in brahma. We show that both maternal and zygotic functions of brahma are required during embryogenesis. In addition, the severe abnormalities caused by loss of maternal brahma expression show that the homeotic genes are not the only targets for brahma activation. The complex pattern of interallelic complementation for the 21 brahma alleles suggests that brahama may act as a multimer. In addition to mutations in brahma, we have isolated mutations in four other essential genes within polytene chromosome subdivisions 72AB. Based on a compilation of similar studies that include about 24% of the genome, we estimate that about 3600 genes in Drosophila can mutate to cause recessive lethality, with fewer than 900 additional genes essential only for gametogenesis. We have identified three times more transcripts than lethal complementation groups in 72AB. One transcript in 72AB is the product of the essential arf-like gene and encodes a member of the ARF subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins. Two other transcripts are probably the products of a single gene whose protein products are similar to the catalytic subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinases.",1994,"B J Brizuela, L Elfring, J Ballard, J W Tamkun, J A Kennison, B J Brizuela, L Elfring, J Ballard, J W Tamkun, J A Kennison"

Here, we report the splicing and spliceosome assembly properties of two such introns: one with a pyrimidine-poor 3' splice site and one with a pyrimidine-rich 3' splice site. The pyrimidine-poor intron was absolutely dependent on its small size for in vivo and in vitro splicing and assembly. As such, it had properties reminiscent of those of yeast introns. The pyrimidine-rich intron had properties intermediate between those of yeasts and vertebrates. This 3' splice site directed assembly of ATP-dependent complexes when present as either an intron or exon and supported low levels of in vivo splicing of a moderate-length intron.

In adults, there are at least 10 reproducibly stained components.

The distribution of cytoplasmic bacteria in the early Drosophila embryo is mediated by astral microtubules,8006080,,"Maternally inherited cytoplasmic bacteria have occasionally been observed in embryos and adults of different strains of several Drosophila species. While there is a considerable body of data on the relationship between bacteria and embryo viability, little is known about the behavior of these bacteria during the early development of Drosophila. In eggs laid by infected Drosophila melanogaster females we showed that cytoplasmic bacteria were initially concentrated in a thin cortical layer and scattered in the yolk region. During the following syncytial blastoderm mitoses the bacteria mainly accumulated towards the poles of the mitotic spindles, suggesting that astral microtubules play a role in localizing bacteria. This is supported by the observation that treatment of the infected embryos with the microtubule-disrupting drug colchicine led to the partial dissociation of the bacteria from the spindle poles, whereas cytochalasin treatment left almost all the bacterial clusters intact. Moreover, bacteria were not found near the polar bodies and yolk nuclei, which were without astral microtubules. In mitosis-defective embryos, with centrosomes dissociated from the nuclei, the bacteria were concentrated in association with the isolated astral microtubules, and in cold-treated embryos, in which microtubules regrew from isolated centrosomes after recovering, the bacteria clustered around the newly formed asters. These observations, also supported by electron microscope analysis, indicate a close relationship between cytoplasmic bacteria and astral microtubules, and suggest that the latter were able to build discrete cytoplasmic domains ensuring the proper distribution of cytoplasmic components during the blastoderm mitoses, despite the lack of cell membranes.",1994,"G Callaini, M G Riparbelli, R Dallai, G Callaini, M G Riparbelli, R Dallai"

Our study tries to establish the quantitative importance of both organs as olfactory information mediators. Dose-response curves for three odorants: ethyl acetate, propionaldehyde and benzaldehyde were carried out for comparing olfaction in either complete animals or flies surgically deprived of antennae. Antennaless flies tested in our behavioral assay showed indifferent, attractant and repellent responses depending on concentration, similarly as normal flies do. However, they clearly displayed less sensitivity than normal flies. The range of concentrations they were able to perceive was correlated to antennal sensitivity approximately by a factor 1:10 for ethyl acetate and benzaldehyde, and between 1:10 and 1:100 at high concentrations of propionaldehyde. A complementary experiment was performed to test changes in olfactory behavior produced by removing maxillary palps in the presence of antennae. At high concentrations of odorant, responses to ethyl acetate and propionaldehyde experienced small changes when both palps were removed. Results are compatible with a summation model of all olfactory information reaching the brain either through antennae or palps.",1994,"M J Charro, E Alcorta, M J Charro, E Alcorta"

The discrimination was asymmetrical in that Canton-S females clearly distinguished between the two types of males in no-choice tests, but Tai-Y females did not. F1 females expressed an intermediate ability to discriminate, and female progeny of backcrosses expressed a mating phenotype very similar to that of the parental strain to which the backcross was made.

The Drosophila GAGA transcription factor is associated with specific regions of heterochromatin throughout the cell cycle,7813435,,"In virtually all eukaryotes the centromeric regions of chromosomes are composed of heterochromatin, a specialized form of chromatin that is rich in repetitive DNA sequences and is transcriptionally relatively silent. The Drosophila GAGA transcription factor binds to GA/CT-rich sequences in many Drosophila promoters, where it activates transcription, apparently by locally altering chromatin structure and allowing other transcription factors access to the DNA. Here we report the paradoxical finding that GAGA factor is associated with specific regions of heterochromatin at all stages of the cell cycle. A subset of the highly repetitive DNA sequences that make up the bulk of heterochromatin in D. melanogaster are GA/CT-rich and we find a striking correlation between the distribution of GAGA factor and this class of repeat. We propose that GAGA factor binds directly to these repeats and may thereby play a role in modifying heterochromatin structure in these regions. Our observations demonstrate for the first time that a transcriptional regulator can associate with specific DNA sequences in a fully condensed mitotic chromosome. This may help explain how the distinctive character of a committed or differentiated cell can be maintained during cell proliferation.",1994,"J W Raff, R Kellum, B Alberts, J W Raff, R Kellum, B Alberts"

Here we present evidence that a population from Zimbabwe is more than twice as variable as those from the United States of America at the DNA sequence level, that most variants are not shared between the two geographic regions, and that there are nearly fixed differences between the Zimbabwe and USA samples in genomic regions experiencing low recombination rates.

Evolutionary genetics of Drosophila esterases,8119594,10.1007/BF01435043,"Over 30 carboxylester hydrolases have been identified in D. melanogaster. Most are classified as acetyl, carboxyl or cholinesterases. Sequence similarities among most of the carboxyl and all the cholinesterases so far characterised from D. melanogaster and other eukaryotes justify recognition of a carboxyl/cholinesterase multigene family. This family shows minimal sequence similarities with other esterases but crystallographic data for a few non-drosophilid enzymes show that the family shares a distinctive overall structure with some other carboxyl and aryl esterases, so they are all put in one superfamily of/beta hydrolases. Fifteen esterase genes have been mapped in D. melanogaster and twelve are clustered at two chromosomal sites. The constitution of each cluster varies across Drosophila species but two carboxyl esterases in one cluster are sufficiently conserved that their homologues can be identified among enzymes conferring insecticide resistance in other Diptera. Sequence differences between two other esterases, the EST6 carboxyl esterase and acetylcholinesterase, have been interpreted against the consensus super-secondary structure for the carboxyl/cholinesterase multigene family; their sequence differences are widely dispersed across the structure and include substantial divergence in substrate binding sites and the active site gorge. This also applies when EST6 is compared across species where differences in its expression indicate a difference in function. However, comparisons within and among species where EST6 expression is conserved show that many aspects of the predicted super-secondary structure are tightly conserved. Two notable exceptions are a pair of polymorphisms in the substrate binding site of the enzyme in D. melanogaster. These polymorphisms are associated with differences in substrate interactions in vitro and demographic data indicate that the alternative forms are not selectively equivalent in vivo.",1993,"J G Oakeshott, E A van Papenrecht, T M Boyce, M J Healy, R J Russell, J G Oakeshott, E A van Papenrecht, T M Boyce, M J Healy, R J Russell"
"Behavior in light-dark cycles of Drosophila mutants that are arrhythmic, blind, or both",8490212,10.1177/074873049300800106,"Certain of the rhythm mutations in Drosophila melanogaster lead to arrhythmic locomotor activity (and aperiodic eclosion) in constant conditions. In light-dark (LD) cycles, however, such mutants exhibit clear fluctuations between high levels of activity when the lights are on and much lower ones when they are off. Our data, in contrast to some previous conclusions, strongly suggest that period0 (per0) adults are, in LD conditions, merely being ""forced"" into exhibiting periodic behavior. These experiments involved application of 8-, 12-, 16-, and 24-hr LD cycles, in which the arrhythmic mutant could have any of these periodicities imposed upon it, whereas wild-type flies tended to exhibit periods of about 24 hr in cycling conditions whose T values were > 8 hr different from 24. In phase-shift experiments, it was found that Drosophila expressing genotypes associated with rhythmicity achieved a 5-hr advance over a 2-day period following an advanced lights-on; per0 adults altered the phase of their locomotor peaks more rapidly. Against a background of the fact that eyeless or blind flies exhibit normal entrainment, it was hypothesized that double-mutant flies--carrying such visual mutations and per0 as well--should not synchronize to LD cycles, if the forced rhythms seen in the latter single-mutant type are mediated solely by light input through the external photoreceptors. Since an appreciable proportion of the double mutants did synchronize (to LD 12:12), it is thus suggested that the visual cues involved in forcing rhythmicity could be input through the same extraocular photoreceptors that, in general, subserve the fly's rhythm system.",1993,"D A Wheeler, M J Hamblen-Coyle, M S Dushay, J C Hall, D A Wheeler, M J Hamblen-Coyle, M S Dushay, J C Hall"

Furthermore, in D. melanogaster transgenic flies, the D. pseudoobscura l(2)gl protein is produced at a similar level as the D. melanogaster l(2)gl protein and displays an identical spatial pattern of expression. This shows that the highly divergent cis-regulatory elements of the D. pseudoobscura transgene can be fully recognized in D. melanogaster and lead to the synthesis of a transgenic protein that has enough specificity conserved for replacing the tumour-suppressor function normally fulfilled by the D. melanogaster l(2)gl protein.",1993,"I TÃ¶rÃ¶k, K Hartenstein, A Kalmes, R Schmitt, D Strand, B M Mechler"
Sequence of the cDNA encoding an actin homolog in the crayfish Procambarus clarkii,8224920,10.1016/0378-1119(93)90657-o,"A cDNA library was constructed by using mRNAs purified from crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) muscle.

Visual pattern recognition in Drosophila involves retinotopic matching,8413652,10.1038/365751a0,"Honeybees remember the shapes of flowers and are guided by visual landmarks on their foraging trips. How insects recognize visual patterns is poorly understood. Experiments suggest that they try to match retinotopically the incoming visual pattern with a previously stored memory image. But bees can be conditioned to individual pattern parameters such as orientation of contours, colour or size. These and other results are difficult to reconcile with simple template matching. In such investigations, freely moving animals are observed; their behaviour and visual input, therefore, are not well known. Mostly, processing strategies are inferred from stimulus design. We have studied visual pattern recognition with tethered flies (Drosophila melanogaster) in a flight simulator and report here that flies store visual images at, or together with, fixed retinal positions and can retrieve them from there only. Position invariance, an acknowledged property of human pattern recognition, may not exist as a primary mechanism in insects.",1993,"M Dill, R Wolf, M Heisenberg, M Dill, R Wolf, M Heisenberg"
Solitary and synaptonemal complex-associated recombination nodules in pro-nurse cells during oogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,8365349,10.1007/BF00360404,"An oocyte in Drosophila melanogaster originates from 1 of 16 cells comprising an ovarial syncytium. The two pro-oocytes proceed into the pachytene stage of meiosis, but only one develops further into a mature oocyte while the other reverts to a nurse cell. It is known that pro-nurse cells also enter meiosis, as they contain incomplete synaptonemal complexes (SCs). We now show that these cells also harbour recombination nodules (RNs). In cells that only occasionally contain SC segments, the RNs are typically not located close to distinct tripartite SC structures. Instead, these RNs are frequently associated with a spherical body of amorphous material and two to three, more or less parallel fibres, possibly representing SC material. The significance of the solitary RNs is discussed in relation to the present knowledge of the assembly and disassembly of the SC.",1993,"K Schmekel, J Wahrman, B Daneholt, K Schmekel, J Wahrman, B Daneholt"

The 97-amino-acid translation product contains a signal peptide followed by a 73-amino-acid prohormone. The N-terminus of the prohormone has diverged from lepidopteran EH both in its length and amino acid composition, and contains a potential endoproteolytic cleavage site. The deduced sequence of Drosophila EH is 58% identical (36 of 62 amino acids) to that of Manduca EH.

DIRECTIONAL AND STABILIZING DENSITY-DEPENDENT NATURAL SELECTION FOR PUPATION HEIGHT IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,28568099,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1993.tb01208.x,"Six populations of Drosophila melanogaster have been kept at extreme population densities, three high and three low, for 175 generations.

Histamine is a major mechanosensory neurotransmitter candidate in Drosophila melanogaster,8103421,10.1007/BF00304618,"Histamine is known to be the neurotransmitter of insect photoreceptors. Histamine-like immunoreactivity is also found in a number of interneurons in the central nervous system of various insects. Here, we demonstrate by immunohistochemical techniques that, in Drosophila melanogaster (Acalypterae), most or all mechanosensory neurons of imaginal hair sensilla selectively bind antibodies directed against histamine. The histamine-like staining includes the cell bodies of these neurons as well as their axons, which form prominent fibre bundles in peripheral nerves, and their terminal projections in the central neuropil of head and thoracic ganglia. The specificity of the immunostaining is demonstrated by investigating a Drosophila mutant unable to synthesize histamine. Other mechanosensory organs, such as campaniform sensilla or scolopidial organs, do not stain. In the calypteran flies, Musca and Calliphora, we find no comparable immunoreactivity associated with either hair sensilla or the nerves entering the central nervous system, observations in agreement with earlier studies on Calliphora. Thus, histamine seems to be a major mechanosensory transmitter candidate of the adult nervous system of Drosophila, but apparently not of Musca or Calliphora.",1993,"E Buchner, S Buchner, M G Burg, A Hofbauer, W L Pak, I Pollack, E Buchner, S Buchner, M G Burg, A Hofbauer, W L Pak, I Pollack"

Delays in anaphase initiation occur in individual nuclei of the syncytial Drosophila embryo,8257792,10.1091/mbc.4.9.885,"The syncytial divisions of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo lack some of the well established cell-cycle checkpoints. It has been suggested that without these checkpoints the divisions would display a reduced fidelity. To test this idea, we examined division error frequencies in individuals bearing an abnormally long and rearranged second chromosome, designated C(2)EN. Relative to a normal chromosome, this chromosome imposes additional structural demands on the mitotic apparatus in both the early syncytial embryonic divisions and the later somatic divisions. We demonstrate that the C(2)EN chromosome does not increase the error frequency of the late larva neuroblast divisions. However, in the syncytial embryonic nuclear divisions, the C(2)EN chromosome produces a 10-fold increase in division errors relative to embryos with a normal karyotype. During late anaphase of the neuroblast divisions, the sister C(2)EN chromosomes cleanly separate from one another. In contrast, during late anaphase of the syncytial divisions in C(2)EN-bearing nuclei, large amounts of chromatin often lag on the metaphase plate. Live analysis of C(2)EN-bearing embryos demonstrates that individual nuclei in the syncytial population of dividing nuclei often delay in their initiation of anaphase. These delays frequently lead to division errors. Eventually the products of the nuclei delayed in anaphase sink inward and are removed from the dividing population of syncytial nuclei. These results suggest that the Drosophila embryo may be equipped with mechanisms that monitor the fidelity of the syncytial nuclear divisions. Unlike checkpoints that rely on cell cycle delays to identify and correct division errors, these embryonic mechanisms rely on cell cycle delays to identify and discard the products of division errors.",1993,"W Sullivan, D R Daily, P Fogarty, K J Yook, S Pimpinelli, W Sullivan, D R Daily, P Fogarty, K J Yook, S Pimpinelli"
Population genetics of tandem repeats in centromeric heterochromatin: unequal crossing over and chromosomal divergence at the Responder locus of Drosophila melanogaster,8244009,,"The Responder (Rsp) locus in Drosophila melanogaster is the target locus of segregation distortion and is known to be comprised of a tandem array of 120-bp repetitive sequences. In this study, we first determined the large scale molecular structure of the Rsp locus, which extends over a region of 600 kb on the standard sensitive (cn bw) chromosome. Within the region, small Rsp repeat arrays are interspersed with non-Rsp sequences and account for 10-20% of the total sequences. We isolated and sequenced 32 Rsp clones from three different chromosomes. The main results are: (1) Rsp repeats isolated from the same chromosome are not more similar than those from different chromosomes. This implies either that there are more homologous exchanges at the Rsp locus than expected or, alternatively, that the second chromosomes of D. melanogaster have diverged from one another more recently at the centromeric heterochromatin than at the nearby euchromatin. (2) The repeats usually have a dimeric structure with an average difference of 16% between the left and right halves. The differences allow us to easily identify the products of unequal exchanges. Despite the large differences between the two halves, exchanges have occurred frequently and the majority of them fall within a 29-bp interval of identity between the two halves. Our data thus support the suggestion that recombination depends on short stretches of complete identity rather than long stretches of general homology. (3) Frequent unequal crossover events obscure the phylogenetic relationships between repeats; therefore, different parts of any single repeat could often have different phylogenetic histories. The high rate of unequal crossing over may also help explain the evolutionary dynamics of the Rsp locus.",1993,"E L Cabot, P Doshi, M L Wu, C I Wu, E L Cabot, P Doshi, M L Wu, C I Wu"
A correlation between DNA repair capacity and longevity in adult Drosophila melanogaster,8315215,10.1093/geronj/48.4.b124,"Mutagen-sensitive (mus) mutants in Drosophila melanogaster have been biochemically characterized as defective in DNA repair. Life spans of three temperature-sensitive mus strains have been measured to determine if loss of DNA repair capacity has a substantial influence on the longevity of adult Drosophila. The mus(ts) strains have been tested for an effect on longevity, with and without exposure to low doses of the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate. All three strains tested show substantially reduced life spans in the absence of the mutagen. The effect is seen at the restrictive temperature but not at the permissive temperature. In addition, the reduction in life span is enhanced by exposure to very low, sublethal doses of MMS during development. This effect is also temperature-sensitive. Temperature-shift studies indicate that it is mutagen-sensitivity during development that is leading to reduced longevity in adults. These results suggest that the integrity of DNA repair systems may play a role in the longevity of adult Drosophila melanogaster.",1993,"I Whitehead, T A Grigliatti, I Whitehead, T A Grigliatti"
AU-rich intronic elements affect pre-mRNA 5' splice site selection in Drosophila melanogaster,8246985,10.1128/mcb.13.12.7689,"cis-spliced nuclear pre-mRNA introns found in a variety of organisms, including Tetrahymena thermophila, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and plants, are significantly richer in adenosine and uridine residues than their flanking exons are. The functional significance of this intronic AU richness, however, has been demonstrated only in plant nuclei. In these nuclei, 5' and 3' splice sites are selected in part by their positions relative to AU-rich elements spread throughout the length of an intron. Because of this position-dependent selection scheme, a 5' splice site at the normal (+1) exon-intron boundary having only three contiguous consensus nucleotides can compete effectively with an enhanced exonic site (-57E) having nine consensus nucleotides and outcompete an enhanced site (+106E) embedded within the AU-rich intron. To determine whether transitions from AU-poor exonic sequences to AU-rich intronic sequences influence 5' splice site selection in other organisms, alleles of the pea rbcS3A1 intron were expressed in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells, and their splicing patterns were compared with those in tobacco nuclei. We demonstrate that this heterologous transcript can be accurately spliced in transfected Drosophila nuclei and that a +1 G-to-A knockout mutation at the normal splice site activates the same three cryptic 5' splice sites as in tobacco. Enhancement of the exonic (-57) and intronic (+106) sites to consensus splice sites indicates that potential splice sites located in the upstream exon or at the 5' exon-intron boundary are preferred in Drosophila cells over those embedded within AU-rich intronic sequences. In contrast to tobacco, in which the activities of two competing 5' splice sites upstream of the AU-rich intron are modulated by their proximity to the AU transition point, D. melanogaster utilizes the upstream site which has a higher proportion of consensus nucleotides. The enhanced version of the cryptic intronic site is efficiently selected in D. melanogaster when the normal +1 site is weakened or discrete AU-rich elements upstream of the +106E site are disrupted. Selection of this internal site in tobacco requires more drastic disruption of these motifs. We conclude that 5' splice site selection in Drosophila nuclei is influenced by the intrinsic strengths of competing sites and by the presence of AU-rich intronic elements but to a different extent than in tobacco.",1993,"A J McCullough, M A Schuler, A J McCullough, M A Schuler"
The transposable element mariner mediates germline transformation in Drosophila melanogaster,8394264,,"A vector for germline transformation in Drosophila melanogaster was constructed using the transposable element mariner. The vector, denoted pMlwB, contains a mariner element disrupted by an insertion containing the wild-type white gene from D. melanogaster, the beta-galactosidase gene from Escherichia coli and sequences that enable plasmid replication and selection in E. coli. The white gene is controlled by the promoter of the D. melanogaster gene for heat-shock protein 70, and the beta-galactosidase gene is flanked upstream by the promoter of the transposable element P as well as that of mariner. The MlwB element was introduced into the germline of D. melanogaster by co-injection into embryos with an active mariner element, Mos1, which codes for a functional transposase and serves as a helper. Two independent germline insertions were isolated and characterized. The results show that the MlwB element inserted into the genome in a mariner-dependent manner with the termini of the inverted repeats inserted at a TA dinucleotide. Both insertions exhibit an unexpected degree of germline and somatic stability, even in the presence of an active mariner element in the genetic background. These results demonstrate that the mariner transposable element, which is small (1286 bp) and relatively homogeneous in size among different copies, is nevertheless capable of promoting the insertion of the large (13.2 kb) MlwB element. Because of the widespread phylogenetic distribution of mariner among insects, these results suggest that mariner might provide a wide host-range transformation vector for insects.",1993,"D A Lidholm, A R Lohe, D L Hartl"

Acid phosphatase activity in the larval salivary glands of developing Drosophila melanogaster,8513298,10.1006/cbir.1993.1066,"Both the biochemical profile and the optical and fine structural localization of acid phosphatase activity in the larval salivary glands of developing Drosophila melanogaster is described. Biochemically, acid phosphatase shows peak activity in the glands of feeding larvae, followed by a marked decline. Directly preceding the onset of cell histolysis however, enzyme activity increases 1.5 fold and is maintained at this level. Histochemically, acid phosphatase activity initially appears as discrete point or lysosomal sources. As development proceeds, an intense and diffuse form of enzyme is seen, accompanying an extremely vacuolated cytoplasm. Ultrastructurally, the enzyme is located in lysosomes, Golgi elements, multivesicular bodies and both within, and on the extracisternal surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This extracisternal or cytosolic form appears directly preceding cell lysis and eventually shows a comprehensive cellular distribution. Large numbers of acid phosphatase positive haemocytes are attached to the basal glandular surface at all developmental stages. In morphologically intact gland cells, discrete extracisternal enzyme activity appears associated with local areas of degradation.",1993,"H E Jones, I D Bowen, H E Jones, I D Bowen"
Selective amplification of additional members of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family: cloning of additional human and Drosophila ARF-like genes,8415637,10.1073/pnas.90.19.8952,"The ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family is one of four subfamilies of the RAS superfamily of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins (G proteins). Highly degenerate oligonucleotides encoding two conserved regions were used in a PCR reaction to amplify cDNAs encoding each of the known ARF proteins and eight additional cDNA fragments encoding previously unreported human members of the ARF family. Additional sequences were obtained from yeast or fly libraries by using this technique. These oligonucleotides specifically amplify members of the ARF family but not the structurally related G protein alpha subunits or members of the other three subfamilies of the RAS superfamily. Fragments obtained by PCR were used to obtain full-length sequences encoding highly homologous ARF-like (ARL) gene products from human and Drosophila melanogaster libraries, termed ARL2 and Ar184F, respectively. The encoded proteins are each 184 amino acids long and are 76% identical, with 40-45% identity to human ARF1 and Drosophila arf-like (arl) proteins. These genes appear to be generally expressed in human tissues and during Drosophila development. The purified human ARL2 protein differed in several biochemical properties from human ARF proteins, including the complete absence of ARF activity. Thus, the ARF family of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins includes at least 15 distinct but structurally conserved members, including both the functionally conserved ARF proteins and the functionally disparate ARL proteins.

A Drosophila homolog of the Rac- and Cdc42-activated serine/threonine kinase PAK is a potential focal adhesion and focal complex protein that colocalizes with dynamic actin structures,8628256,10.1128/mcb.16.5.1896,"Changes in cell morphology are essential in the development of a multicellular organism. The regulation of the cytoskeleton by the Rho subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins is an important determinant of cell shape. The Rho subfamily has been shown to participate in a variety of morphogenetic processes during Drosophila melanogaster development. We describe here a Drosophila homolog, DPAK, of the serine/threonine kinase PAK, a protein which is a target of the Rho subfamily proteins Rac and Cdc42. Rac, Cdc42, and PAK have previously been implicated in signaling by c-Jun amino-terminal kinases. DPAK bound to activated (GTP-bound) Drosophila Rac (DRacA) and Drosophila Cdc42. Similarities in the distributions of DPAK, integrin, and phosphotyrosine suggested an association of DPAK with focal adhesions and Cdc42- and Rac-induced focal adhesion-like focal complexes. DPAK was elevated in the leading edge of epidermal cells, whose morphological changes drive dorsal closure of the embryo. We have previously shown that the accumulation of cytoskeletal elements initiating cell shape changes in these cells could be inhibited by expression of a dominant-negative DRacA transgene. We show that leading-edge epidermal cells flanking segment borders, which express particularly large amounts of DPAK, undergo transient losses of cytoskeletal structures during dorsal closure. We propose that DPAK may be regulating the cytoskeleton through its association with focal adhesions and focal complexes and may be participating with DRacA in a c-Jun amino-terminal kinase signaling pathway recently demonstrated to be required for dorsal closure.",1996,"N Harden, J Lee, H Y Loh, Y M Ong, I Tan, T Leung, E Manser, L Lim, N Harden, J Lee, H Y Loh, Y M Ong, I Tan, T Leung, E Manser, L Lim"

Expression is localized to limited parts of the body, including specific cell populations in the nervous system. In the wing disc, spalt and spalt-related are expressed in indistinguishable domains; in the nervous system and some other organs the expression patterns extensively overlap but are not identical, indicating that the genes have partially diverged in terms of developmental regulation.

A quantitative measure of the mitotic pairing of alleles in Drosophila melanogaster and the influence of structural heterozygosity,8722790,,"In Drosophila there exist several examples of gene expression that can be modified by an interaction between alleles; this effect is known as transvection. The inference that alleles interact comes from the observations that homologous chromosomes pair in mitotically dividing cells, and that chromosome rearrangements can alter the phenotype produced by a pair of alleles. It is thought that heterozygous rearrangements impede the ability of alleles to pair and interact. However, because the existing data are inconsistent, this issue is not fully settled. By measuring the frequency of site-specific recombination between homologous chromosomes, we show that structural heterozygosity inhibits the pairing of alleles that lie distal to a rearrangement breakpoint. We suggest that some of the apparent conflicts may owe to variations in cell-cycle lengths in the tissues where the relevant allelic interactions occur. Cells with a longer cell cycle have more time to establish the normal pairing relationships that have been disturbed by rearrangements. In support, we show that Minute mutations, which slow the rate of cell division, partially restore a transvection effect that is disrupted by inversion heterozygosity.",1996,"M M Golic, K G Golic, M M Golic, K G Golic"
Spatial and temporal expression of 4f-rnp gene in Drosophila melanogaster,8983176,10.1046/j.1432-0436.1996.6120103.x,"We have recently discovered that a pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) encoded by the 4f-rnp gene in Drosophila melanogaster undergoes RNA editing by site-specific A-to-G conversions. In this report, we describe the spatial and temporal expression patterns of 4f-rnp mRNA transcripts during fly development. The 4f-rnp locus was mapped by polytene in situ hybridization experiments to the 4F1,2 bands at the distal tip of the X-chromosome, demonstrating that this gene is nuclear. We show that 4f-rnp is a single-copy gene by a combination of genomic Southern blot hybridization and restriction map analysis of clones isolated through chromosome walking techniques. Northern blot analysis indicates that two alternatively spliced messenger RNA transcripts, differing in length by 200-300 nucleotides, are synthesized in adult male and female flies, during embryogenesis and throughout the larval period. Using tissue in situ hybridization techniques that do not distinguish between the transcripts, we find that the distribution of 4f-rnp mRNAs is specific to germline tissue in the ovary, demonstrating that these transcripts are maternally produced. During embryogenesis, 4f-rnp transcripts are localized within cells of most tissues, but they have a very distinct localization pattern within the segmental ganglia of the central nervous system. We discuss the significance that RNA editing is expected to have for the predicted 4F-RNP protein products that may be expressed throughout fly development and in high abundance within the fly's central nervous system.",1996,"K A Hess, A A Simone, J P Petschek, K A Hess, A A Simone, J P Petschek"
Drosophila melanogaster SL2 cells contain a hypoxically inducible DNA binding complex which recognises mammalian HIF-binding sites,8674541,10.1016/0014-5793(96)00484-x,"Nuclear extracts from Drosophila SL2 cells were found to contain a hypoxically inducible complex capable of binding to hypoxia response elements from mammalian genes. This complex (HIF-D) resembled mammalian hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1) in DNA sequence specificity, abrogation of induction by cycloheximide, induction by desferrioxamine and redox sensitivity of DNA binding. However, HIF-D was not induced by cobalt and was less sensitive to phosphatase than HIF-1. Endogenous phosphoglycerate kinase mRNA in SL2 cells showed similar inducible characteristics to HIF-D. These findings are evidence that the mammalian HIF-1 dependent system of oxygen regulated gene expression has a functional homologue in Drosophila.",1996,"M Nagao, B L Ebert, P J Ratcliffe, C W Pugh, M Nagao, B L Ebert, P J Ratcliffe, C W Pugh"
Cloning and characterization of the scute (sc) gene of Drosophila subobscura,8913748,,"The scute (sc) gene, a member of the achaete-scute complex of Drosophila melanogaster, has dual functions: sisterless (sis-b) function required for sex determination and dosage compensation and scute function, which is involved in neurogenesis. The sc homologue of D. subobscura was cloned. It lacks introns and encodes a single 1.7-kb transcript slightly larger than that of D. melanogaster (1.6 kb). The sc protein of D. subobscura is slightly larger than that of D. melanogaster (382 vs. 345 amino acids). Sequence comparisons between both species show the Sc protein to have a highly conserved bHLH domain. Outside this domain, amino acid replacements are not randomly distributed. Two additional conserved domains, of 20 and 36 amino acids, are present near the C-terminal end. They may represent domains confering specificity upon the Sc protein with respect to other proteins of the achaete-scute complex. In its 3' untranslated region, Sc RNA contains uridine stretches, putative Sxl protein DNA-binding sites. The D. subobscura Sc protein can cooperate with other D. melanogaster bHLH proteins because D. subobscura sc supplies sis-b function when introduced into D. melanogaster transgenic flies mutant for sc.",1996,"L M Botella, C DoÃ±oro, L SÃ¡nchez, C Segarra, B Granadino, L M Botella, C DoÃ±oro, L SÃ¡nchez, C Segarra, B Granadino"

The chromatids, however, seem to move to the poles in two separate groups in each half spindle, mingling together during telophase, before the formation of the daughter nuclei.

Requirement of an ICE-like protease for induction of apoptosis and ceramide generation by REAPER,8628997,10.1126/science.271.5250.808,"Genetic studies indicated that the Drosophila melanogaster protein REAPER (RPR) controls apoptosis during embryo development. Induction of RPR expression in Drosophila Schneider cells rapidly stimulated apoptosis. RPR-mediated apoptosis was blocked by N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk), which suggests that an interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE)-like protease is required for RPR function. RPR-induced apoptosis was associated with increased ceramide production that was also blocked by Z-VAD-fmk, which suggests that ceramide generation requires an ICE-like protease as well. Thus, the intracellular RPR protein uses cell death signaling pathways similar to those used by the vertebrate transmembrane receptors Fas (CD95) and tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1.",1996,"G J Pronk, K Ramer, P Amiri, L T Williams, G J Pronk, K Ramer, P Amiri, L T Williams"
Mutations in the Drosophila melanogaster gene encoding S-adenosylmethionine synthetase [corrected] suppress position-effect variegation,8725236,,"In Drosophila melanogaster, the study of trans-acting modifier mutations of position-effect variegation and Polycomb group (Pc-G) genes have been useful tools to investigate genes involved in chromatin structure. We have cloned a modifier gene, Suppressor of zeste 5 (Su(z)5), which encodes S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, and we present here molecular results and data concerning its expression in mutants and genetic interactions. The mutant alleles Su(z)5, l(2)R23 and l(2)M6 show suppression of wm4 and also of two white mutants induced by roo element insertions in the regulatory region i.e., wis (in combination with z1) and wsp1. Two of the Su(z)5 alleles, as well as a deletion of the gene, also act as enhancers of Polycomb by increasing the size of sex combs on midleg. The results suggest that Su(z)5 is connected with regulation of chromatin structure. The enzyme S-adenosylmethionine synthetase is involved in the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine, a methyl group donor and also, after decarboxylation, a propylamino group donor in the bio-synthesis of polyamines. Our results from HPLC analysis show that in ovaries from heterozygous Su(z)5 mutants the content of spermine is significantly reduced.

Drosophila Sgs genes: stage and tissue specificity of hormone responsiveness,8593163,10.1002/bies.950180110,"The up- and down-regulation of the salivary gland secretion protein (Sgs) genes during the third larval instar of Drosophila melanogaster are controlled by fluctuations of the titre of the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). Induction of these genes by a low hormone titre is a secondary response to 20E mediated by products of 20E-induced 'early' genes. Surprisingly, in the case of the Sgs-4 gene this response also requires a direct contribution of the 20E-receptor complex. A model is presented which proposes that the Sgs genes, and other 20E-regulated genes with similar temporal expression profiles, are regulated by complex hormone response units. The hormonal signal is effectively transmitted by these response units only after binding of additional factors, e.g. secretion enhancer binding proteins, which act together in a synergistic manner with the 20E receptor and early gene products to establish a stage- and tissue-specific expression pattern.",1996,"M Lehmann, M Lehmann"
"Mobility of hAT transposable elements in the Old World bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera",8933173,10.1111/j.1365-2583.1996.tb00096.x,"The P, hobo, Hermes, Minos and mariner transposable elements have been successfully used as gene vectors to achieve genetic transformation of Drosophila melanogaster. The hobo transposable element of D. melanogaster, a member of the hAT family of transposable elements, can also transpose in other dipteran species including the house fly Musca domestica and the Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni. Another hAT element, Hermes, can also transpose in a wide range of insect species. We report here that both of these hAT elements are also capable of mobility and accurate transposition in the noctuid Helicoverpa armigera and thus may be able to be used as gene vectors that will enable the genetic transformation of this important pest species. Significantly, the ability of hobo to excise in this species is independent of the presence of an exogenous source of hobo transposase, which suggests that H. armigera may possess an endogenous hobo-like transposable element.",1996,"A C Pinkerton, D A O'Brochta, P W Atkinson, A C Pinkerton, D A O'Brochta, P W Atkinson"
Evolutionary changes in the expression pattern of a developmentally essential gene in three Drosophila species,8692952,10.1073/pnas.93.14.7103,"The hypothesis that morphological evolution may largely result from changes in gene regulation rather than gene structure has been difficult to test. Morphological differences among insects are often apparent in the cuticle structures produced. The dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) and alpha-methyldopa hypersensitive (amd) genes arose from an ancient gene duplication. In Drosophila, they have evolved nonoverlapping functions, including the production of distinct types of cuticle, and for Ddc, the production of the neurotransmitters, dopamine and serotonin. The amd gene is particularly active in the production of specialized flexible cuticles in the developing embryo. We have compared the pattern of amd expression in three Drosophila species. Several regions of expression conserved in all three species but, surprisingly, a unique domain of expression is found in Drosophila simulans that does occur in the closely related (2-5 million years) Drosophila melanogaster or in the more remote (40-50 million years) Drosophila virilis. The ""sudden"" appearance of a completely new and robust domain of expression provides a glimpse of evolutionary variation resulting from changes in regulation of structural gene expression.",1996,"D Wang, J L Marsh, F J Ayala, D Wang, J L Marsh, F J Ayala"
Amino acid polymorphism and rare electrophoretic variants of G6PD from natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster,8722791,,"Identifying the amino acid changes responsible for electrophoretic variants is essential to understanding the significance of allozyme polymorphism in adaptation. The amino acid mutations responsible for the common G6PD allozyme polymorphisms in Drosophila melanogaster have been recently described. This study characterizes the amino acid changes associated with 11 rare electrophoretic G6PD variants. The 11 rare electrophoretic variants result from six independent amino acid mutations. The in vivo function of the rare variants was determined in an earlier study and most variants fell into one of two function classes. It is shown here that the function of the rare variants reflects the state of the Pro/Leu mutation responsible for the A/B allozyme polymorphism in each variant. Two mutations destabilize quaternary structure resulting in shifts from tetrameric dimeric alleles, and one of these also results in a variant with in vivo function intermediate to A and B. That mutation is an aspartic-acid-to-asparagine change that is two residues away from the Pro/Leu polymorphism responsible for the A/B dimertetramer quaternary shift. Structure-function relationships based on studies of human G6PD deficiency-associated mutations predict that these last two amino acid changes fall within the protein domain responsible for NADP binding.",1996,"W F Eanes, M Kirchner, D R Taub, J Yoon, J T Chen, W F Eanes, M Kirchner, D R Taub, J Yoon, J T Chen"
Interallelic complementation at the suppressor of forked locus of Drosophila reveals complementation between suppressor of forked proteins mutated in different regions,8846900,,"The Su(f) protein of Drosophila melanogaster shares extensive homologies with proteins from yeast (RNA14) and man (77 kD subunit of cleavage stimulation factor) that are required for 3' end processing of mRNA. These homologies suggest that su(f) is involved in mRNA 3' end formation and that some aspects of this process are conserved throughout eukaryotes. We have investigated the genetic and molecular complexity of the su(f) locus. The su(f) gene is transcribed to produce three RNAs and could encode two proteins. Using constructs that contain different parts of the locus, we show that only the larger predicted gene product of 84 kD is required for the wild-type function of su(f). Some lethal alleles of su(f) complement to produce viable combinations. The structures of complementing and noncomplementing su(f) alleles indicate that 84-kD Su(f) proteins mutated in different domains can act in combination for partial su(f) function.

When significance levels were corrected on an experimentwide basis, no line had significant increases in phenotypic variance for sternopleural bristle counts, although two lines had significant increases in thorax length variance. These results demonstrate that inbred lines cannot be treated as necessarily more uniform than outbred lines and that results on changes in variance due to inbreeding should be treated with caution unless there has been sufficient replication. These results also demonstrate the validity of an important assumption of models of evolution by variance-mediated mechanisms, such as the variance-induced peak-shift model.",1996,"Michael C Whitlock, Kevin Fowler, Michael C Whitlock, Kevin Fowler"

Egg chorion in the 2 parasitoid strains showed the same morphology and the same modifications after egg laying whatever the host strain. When a capsule is built, a small dotted dense layer was first spread on the chorion, followed by accumulation layers of cells (plasmatocytes and lamellocytes) and lastly necrosis of the inner haemocytes. The encapsulated eggs darken only at the time of necrosis of haemocytes. In susceptible hosts, neither the tiny dense layer nor haemocyte accumulation occurred. We concluded that (1) this tiny dense layer was present before the deposition of the first haemocytes, (2) inhibition of deposition of this dense layer was the initial event of the induced immunosuppression, (3) haemocytes other than lamellocytes were engaged in capsule formation, (4) the immunosuppressive factors did not target only the lamellocytes but also the plasmatocytes, (5) darkening of the encapsulated eggs was due to cell necrosis rather than to extracellular melanin deposition.",1996,"J Russo, S Dupas, F Frey, Y Carton, M Brehelin, J Russo, S Dupas, F Frey, Y Carton, M Brehelin"
Codon usage bias and tRNA abundance in Drosophila,9342399,10.1007/pl00006256,"Codon usage bias of 1,117 Drosophila melanogaster genes, as well as fewer D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis genes, was examined from the perspective of relative abundance of isoaccepting tRNAs and their changes during development. We found that each amino acid contributes about equally and highly significantly to overall codon usage bias, with the exception of Asp which had very low contribution to overall bias. Asp was also the only amino acid that did not show a clear preference for one of its synonymous codons. Synonymous codon usage in Drosophila was consistent with ""optimal"" codons deduced from the isoaccepting tRNA availability. Interestingly, amino acids whose major isoaccepting tRNAs change during development did not show as strong bias as those with developmentally unchanged tRNA pools. Asp is the only amino acid for which the major isoaccepting tRNAs change between larval and adult stages.

Normal lines and exposure lines, kept on 5% ethanol supplemented medium for at least 20 generations, were established from each strain and the responses of the two lines to different ethanol concentrations were compared. Two survival components were estimated in the juvenile life history stages. In addition, the weights of the emerging adult males were measured at various concentrations of ethanol. The changes in the activities of two enzymes (ADH and alpha GPDH) were also surveyed in the larvae after the different ethanol treatments. Strain-specific differences were observed in the responses of all investigated traits to ethanol. OdhS-AldoxF larvae seemed to be more tolerant to ethanol than the larvae of the other two strains while the utilisation of ethanol as energy source appeared to be the least effective in this strain. Larvae of the exposure lines had significantly higher tolerance to ethanol, and the adult males were heavier, than the ones from the normal lines. The enzymatic responses of the two lines to the ethanol treatments were also different. ADH activity, fresh male weight, and pupa-to-adult survival seemed only to be associated under short-term exposure to ethanol.

The overall deduced protein structure for Dmel/Nck is similar to that of mammalian Na+/Ca2+ exchanger genes NCX1 and NCX2, having six hydrophobic regions in the amino terminus separated from six at the carboxy-terminal end by a large intracellular loop. Sequence comparison of the Drosophila exchanger cDNAs with NCX1 and NCX2 Na+/Ca2+ exchangers are approximately 46% identical at the deduced amino acid level. Consensus phosphorylation sites for both protein kinase C and protein kinase A are present on the intracellular loop region of the Dmel/Nck. Alternative splicing for the Dmel/Nck gene is suggested in the same intracellular loop region as demonstrated for NCX1. Functionally, the Drosophila Na+/ Ca2+ exchanger expressed in oocytes differs from expressed mammalian NCX1 with regard to Ca2+ transport in Ca2+/ Ca2+ exchange and the effect of monovalent-dependent Ca2+/ Ca2+ exchange. The Dmel/Nck gene maps to chromosome 3 (93A-B) using in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes, the same position as the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, a related transporter.

Second, a comparison of orthologous gene expression patterns in other insects reveals that these regulatory genes are deployed in similar, yet distinct, patterns in different insects. Third, comparisons of embryonic morphology with gene expression patterns suggest that in general these genes promote a common insect body plan, but that variations in gene expression can often be correlated to variations in morphology. Here, we present a detailed review of the development of the cephalic ectoderm of Drosophila and extrapolate to development of a generalized insect head.

Drug disruption of short-term memory in Drosophila melanogaster,9329066,10.1016/s0091-3057(97)00045-2,"Recent work on operant visual learning and memory in Drosophila has suggested at least three distinct memory phases. Trying to disrupt memory pharmacologically, we fed flies with ouabain or the depolarizing drugs potassium chloride (KCl), lithium chloride (LiCl) and monosodium glutamate for some specific time before training. The depolarizing drugs abolished memory very soon after training. Ouabain exerted no effect on memory within the first 20 min but abolished it more than 30 min after training. These drugs had no diminishing effects on the visual discrimination and behavioral performance of the flies during training. This result suggests that memory disruption may not be induced by nonspecific effects of the drugs. In addition, reversal training of the KCl-fed flies indicates that KCl appears not to impair the retrieval mechanism of flies. These results suggest that the specific disruptive effects of the drugs on memory formation and the existence of a short-term memory phase, are susceptible to disruption of the depolarizing drugs but unaffected by ouabain.",1997,"S Xia, L Liu, C Feng, A Guo, S Xia, L Liu, C Feng, A Guo"

First, genetic analyses allow the integration of phenomena that are analyzed at many levels of observation from the molecule to the intact organism, and second, genetics has the real power to reveal causality by factors that are not dependent upon the prejudice of the investigator.

Males and females mutant for ibx have normal egg-to-adult survival and appear normal in several ""general"" behavioral traits including olfaction, phototaxis, locomotor activity, and heartbeat. ibx males court normally, and are successful in mating. These characteristics suggest that ibx does not cause sensory or motor defects. Ovarian growth and sperm storage are wild-type in ibx/ibx females. Treatment with the JH analog methoprene increases the receptivity of ibx/ibx females.",1997,"C Kerr, J Ringo, H Dowse, E Johnson, C Kerr, J Ringo, H Dowse, E Johnson"

Purification and characterization of the prothoracicotropic hormone of Drosophila melanogaster,9037018,10.1073/pnas.94.4.1130,"The prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) of Drosophila melanogaster is a modulator of ecdysteroid (molting hormone) synthesis and was isolated and characterized from extracts of whole larvae (approximately 4 x 10(5) larvae). The purification protocol included delipidation, salt-extraction, heat treatment, conventional column chromatography, and HPLC, and yielded about 50 microg of pure hormone. Biological activity was followed using a ring gland in vitro assay in which ecdysteroidogenesis by control ring glands as measured by radioimmunoassay was compared with ring gland incubations containing active fractions. The molecular weight of the purified PTTH was 45 kDa and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis indicated that those analyzed sequences displayed no significant homology with known peptides or peptide hormones, including PTTH from the silkmoth, Bombyx mori. Western blot analysis indicated that the native form of Drosophila PTTH was a single 66-kDa polypeptide with N-linked carbohydrate chains and intrachain disulfide bonds. The purified 45-kDa peptide is the deglycosylated form, a result of glycosidase activity present during preparation of the PTTH extract. The deglycosylated form shows heterogeneity, presumably as a result of varying degrees of deglycosylation at the N terminus.",1997,"A J Kim, G H Cha, K Kim, L I Gilbert, C C Lee, A J Kim, G H Cha, K Kim, L I Gilbert, C C Lee"
The phenotypic plasticity of wing size in Drosophila melanogaster: the cellular basis of its genetic variation,9316253,10.1038/hdy.1997.153,"The reaction norms in Drosophila melanogaster of thorax length, wing length and cell size were determined for 28 isofemale lines from three populations to investigate the role of cell size in determining the response of body size to temperature during the preimaginal stages. Both overall level and plasticity of the reaction norms of thorax length and wing length are highly correlated, leading to a relatively constant wing-thorax ratio between lines. Genetic differences in overall level of wing size reaction norms are mainly caused by differences in cell number. The response of wing size to temperature consists of changes in cell size and, to a lesser extent, cell number. The cellular basis of genetic differences in plasticity shows a transition point at an intermediate level. In steeper reaction norms, genetic differences in plasticity result from differences in the plasticity of cell size, whereas less steep reaction norms only differ in the plasticity of cell number. A significant partial correlation between wing length plasticity and cell size plasticity, correcting for thorax length plasticity, indicates a role of cell size in determining the wing-thorax ratio.",1997,"G H De Moed, G De Jong, W Scharloo, G H De Moed, G De Jong, W Scharloo"
Comparing Different Measures of Heat Resistance in Selected Lines of Drosophila melanogaster,12769901,10.1016/s0022-1910(96)00108-4,"Lines of the fly Drosophila melanogaster were selected for increased knockdown resistance to heat (39 degrees C) in a long tube. One set of lines was selected following prior heat hardening (1 h at 37 degrees C) and another without hardening. Each set consisted of three replicate selection lines and three unselected controls. Lines were tested for correlated responses to selection, in order to define the nature of knockdown resistance. Selection had a large effect on knockdown resistance, but selected lines did not differ from controls for knockdown time in small vials, survival, or recovery time following exposure to heat. Selection with and without hardening influenced the hardening response in the long tube, but not in small vial assays of resistance. The hardened selection lines had decreased resistance to ethanol and a reduced dry weight, whereas the non-hardened lines did not show these changes. The same correlated responses were also evident in two generation experiments on unselected flies. Both sets of lines showed a reduction in activity when tested at 37 degrees C, but not at 25 degrees C. These results indicate that different measures of heat resistance are surprisingly unrelated, and suggest that subtle features of the selective environment influence responses and correlated responses to selection.

Insect circadian rhythms and photoperiodism,9783440,10.1007/BF02480370,"Two clock-controlled processes, overt circadian rhythmicity and the photoperiodic induction of diapause, are described in the blow fly, Calliphora vicina and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Circadian locomotor rhythms of the adult flies reflect endogenous, self-sustained oscillations with a temperature compensated period. The free-running rhythms become synchronised (entrained) to daily light:dark cycles, but become arrhythmic in constant light above a certain intensity. Some flies show fragmented rhythms (internal desynchronisation) suggesting that overt rhythmicity is the product of a multioscillator (multicellular) system. Photoperiodic induction of larval diapause in C. vicina and of ovarian diapause in D. melanogaster is also based on the circadian system but seems to involve a separate mechanism at both the molecular and neuronal levels. For both processes in both species, the compound eyes and ocelli are neither essential nor necessary for photic entrainment, and the circadian clock mechanism is not within the optic lobes. The central brain is the most likely site for both rhythm generation and extra-optic photoreception. In D. melanogaster, a group of lateral brain neurons has been identified as important circadian pacemaker cells, which are possibly also photo-sensitive. Similar lateral brain neurons, staining for arrestin, a protein in the phototransduction 'cascade' and a selective marker for photoreceptors in both vertebrates and invertebrates, have been identified in C. vicina. Much less is known about the cellular substrate of the photoperiodic mechanism, but this may involve the pars intercerebralis region of the mid-brain.",1997,"D S Saunders, D S Saunders"
DROSOPOSON: a knowledge base on chromosomal localization of transposable element insertions in Drosophila,9088710,10.1093/bioinformatics/13.1.61,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      What forces maintain transposable elements (TEs) in genomes and populations is one of the main questions to understand the dynamics of these elements, but the exact nature of these forces is still a matter of speculation. To test theoretical models of TE population dynamics, we need many data on the genomic distributions of various elements. These data are now accumulating for the species Drosophila melanogaster, but they are scattered in the literature.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The knowledge base DROSOPOSON thus brings together: (1) data available on Drosophila chromosomal localizations of TE insertions and on features of the polytene chromosomes (DNA content, recombination rate, break-points, etc); (2) statistical methods aimed at analysing the distribution of the TE insertions along the chromosomes. In this paper, we present the structure of the base, the data and the statistical methods. Theoretical models of containment of TE copy number in Drosophila can thus be tested.",1997,"C Hoogland, C BiÃ©mont, C Hoogland, C BiÃ©mont"

Low mutation rates of microsatellite loci in Drosophila melanogaster,8988178,10.1038/ng0197-99,"Analysis of variation at microsatellite DNA loci is widely used in studies of parentage, linkage and evolutionary history. The utility of microsatellites is primarily due to high levels of allelic diversity, believed to reflect mutation rates orders of magnitude higher than base pair substitutions at single-copy genes. For humans, mice, rats and pigs, microsatellite mutation rates have been estimated at 10(-3)-10(-5). However, a recent study comparing microsatellite variation in humans with non-human primates suggests that microsatellite mutation rates may vary considerably across taxa. We measured mutation rates of 24 microsatellite loci in mutation accumulation lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Surprisingly, only a single mutation was detected after screening 157,680 allele-generations, yielding an estimated average mutation rate per locus of 6.3 x 10(-6), a mutation rate considerably lower than reported for various mammals. We propose that the comparatively low mutation rate is primarily a function of short microsatellite repeat lengths in the D. melanogaster genome.",1997,"M D Schug, T F Mackay, C F Aquadro, M D Schug, T F Mackay, C F Aquadro"
Deleterious consequences of Hsp70 overexpression in Drosophila melanogaster larvae,9250396,10.1379/1466-1268(1997)002<0060:dcohoi>2.3.co;2,"We compared transgenic Drosophila larvae varying in hsp70 copy number to assess the consequences of Hsp70 overexpression for growth and development after heat shock. Exposure to a mildly elevated temperature (36 degrees C) induced expression of Hsp70 (and presumably other heat shock proteins) and improved tolerance of more severe heat stress, 38.5-39.5 degrees C. We examined this pattern in two independently derived pairs of extra-copy and excision strains that differed primarily in hsp70 copy number (with 22 and 10 copies, respectively). Extra-copy larvae produced more Hsp70 in response to high temperature than did excision larvae, but surpassed the excision strain in survival only immediately after thermal stress. Excision larvae survived to adulthood at higher proportions than did extra-copy larvae and grew more rapidly after thermal stress. Furthermore, multiple pretreatment reduced survival of 1st-instar extra-copy larvae, but did not affect the corresponding excision strain. While extra Hsp70 provides additional protection against the immediate damage from heat stress, abnormally high concentrations can decrease growth, development and survival to adulthood.",1997,"R A Krebs, M E Feder, R A Krebs, M E Feder"
Effects of the nuclear genome on selective transmission of mitochondrial DNA in Drosophila,9339540,10.1266/ggs.72.119,"In mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy in Drosophila, we previously reported that mtDNA was selectively transmitted depending on temperature (Matsuura et al., 1991). To investigate the effects of nuclear genome on the temperature-dependent transmission, two sets of heteroplasmy were constructed by germ-plasm transplantation, and changes in the relative proportion of two types of mtDNA were examined at 19 degrees C and 25 degrees C. In heteroplasmy possessing D. melanogaster and D. mauritiana mtDNA, two different nuclear genomes of D. melanogaster were examined after reciprocally substituting the nuclear genomes. In heteroplasmy possessing D. simulans and D. mauritiana mtDNA, nuclear genomes of D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. mauritiana were used. For each set of mtDNA combination, the modes of temperature-dependent transmission of mtDNA differed according to the nuclear genome used. From these and our previous results (Matsuura et al., 1991; Tsujimoto et al., 1991), it is clear that the temperature-dependent transmission of mtDNA is affected by nuclear genome. This suggests that the nuclear genome is involved in determining the temperature-dependency of mtDNA transmission.",1997,"E T Matsuura, Y T Tanaka, N Yamamoto, E T Matsuura, Y T Tanaka, N Yamamoto"
In vitro assembly of Drosophila lamin Dm0--lamin polymerization properties are conserved,9431987,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.t01-1-00030.x,"Vertebrate nuclear lamins exhibit polymerization properties that are remarkably different from those of vertebrate cytoplasmic intermediate filament (IF) proteins. Notably, under conditions where vertebrate cytoplasmic IF proteins form tetramers consisting of laterally associated dimers, nuclear lamin dimers associate longitudinally into head-to-tail polymers. Also, in vitro, nuclear lamins readily form paracrystalline fibers, rather than stable 10-nm filaments. To investigate whether these properties are also shared with invertebrate nuclear lamins, we analyzed in considerable detail the polymerization behavior of recombinant full-length lamin Dm0 from the invertebrate Drosophila melanogaster. This lamin differs substantially from vertebrate lamins in its primary structure. We also analyzed lamin Dm0-derived fragments lacking either the head domain (headless), the tail domain (tailless), or both (rod). Like vertebrate lamins, full-length Drosophila lamin Dm0 assembled into head-to-tail polymers, with little or no formation of tetramers by lateral association of dimers. This longitudinal assembly was severely inhibited by deletion of the head domain. Removal of the tail domain led to increased formation of filamentous polymers. Under appropriate conditions, full-length Drosophila lamin Dm0 as well as the three lamin Dm0-derived fragments assembled into paracrystalline fibers. No steady-state condition tested yielded assembly of 10-nm filaments resembling those formed by vertebrate cytoplasmic IF proteins. These findings indicate that the in vitro assembly behavior of nuclear lamins is highly conserved but distinct from that of cytoplasmic IF proteins, thus evidencing its functional importance.",1997,"B Sasse, A Lustig, U Aebi, N Stuurman, B Sasse, A Lustig, U Aebi, N Stuurman"
Genetic factors on the second and third chromosomes responsible for the variation of amylase activity and inducibility in Drosophila melanogaster,9449186,10.1017/s0016672397002887,"Using second- or third-chromosome substitution lines of Drosophila melanogaster, the genetic variation of inducibility and amylase specific activities in three media (starch, normal and glucose) were investigated. Genetic factors on both the second and third chromosomes were responsible for the variation in amylase specific activity and inducibility. In glucose medium, the genetic variance of amylase specific activity estimated for the second-chromosome substitution lines was larger than that for the third-chromosome substitution lines; however, for starch medium and inducibility, the variance was larger for the third-chromosome substitution lines. High correlations for the second-chromosome substitution lines and low correlations for the third-chromosome substitution lines were observed for amylase specific activities in different media. These results suggest that the genetic factor(s) responsible for inducibility or amylase activity variation in an induced medium such as starch should be on the third chromosome and those in the non-induced medium such as glucose should be on the second chromosome. The functional roles of the factors on the second and third chromosomes would be the repression and induction of amylase, respectively.",1997,"Y Matsuo, T Yamazaki, Y Matsuo, T Yamazaki"
The influence of 2-propanol and acetone on oviposition rate and oviposition site preference for acetic acid and ethanol of Drosophila melanogaster,9210788,10.1023/a:1025697627556,"Drosophila melanogaster strains, homozygous for the alcohol dehydrogenase alleles AdhF, AdhS, and Adhn4 respectively, were tested for oviposition site preference with a Multiple Choice Device consisting of 18 patches per choice disk. Equal numbers of patches with ethanol-, acetic acid-, and water-supplemented medium were offered simultaneously. Patches with acetic acid-supplemented medium were chosen predominantly as oviposition sites. Pretreatment of flies with increasing concentrations of 2-propanol to inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity resulted not only in a decreasing choice of acetic acid patches, but also in the laying of a decreasing number of eggs. Adh-null mutant flies showed a similar change in behavior pattern after 2-propanol treatment. Therefore it was concluded that ADH activity is not involved primarily in oviposition site preference behavior. A complicating factor is acetone, the oxidation product of 2-propanol, which had an even larger impact on egg production. However, differences in ADH allozymes with respect to biochemical oxidation capacity of secondary alcohols will not necessarily lead to differences between the Adh genotypes in oviposition rates or apparent changes in preferences, due to additional biochemical differences in inhibition rates by acetone of the various allozymes and other enzyme systems.",1997,"K T Eisses, K T Eisses"
[Do viruses participate in the origin of group outbursts of gene mutations occurring in natural Drosophila populations?],9879120,,"It has been experimentally shown that different viruses apathogenic for Drosophila and unable to reproduce in it, and also highly polymerized DNA isolated from these viruses, act as effective mutagens when injected into the hemolymph of this insect. They induce numerous lethal and visible stable gene mutations. Some of them can be present in Drosophila natural populations. But these virus induced gene mutations or those induced by virus DNA never take part in the origin of group outbursts of gene mutation which are observed in Drosophila melanogaster natural populations. These mutability outbursts include only gene mutations induced by transpositions of mobile genetic elements. These mutations are usually unstable: they are apt to be converted to other allelic mutant states which are phenotypically differently expressed. Viruses which are endemic for Drosophila melanogaster and can reproduce in it take no part in the outbursts of gene mutations. They can only induce a small number of lethal and visible gene mutations which are stable and arise very infrequently. It seems probable that group outbursts of gene mutations in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster are a result of various environmental stresses which cause a rise in the frequency of transpositions of mobile genetic elements, this leading to the mutability outbursts of gene mutations.",1998,"S M Gershenzon, S M Gershenzon"

The C-terminal part of the mature peptide is highly conserved between D. melanogaster and the two copies of D. subobscura. In this species, both copies of the gene are transcribed and, like in D. melangaster, only expressed in males. The duplicated region includes 300 bp upstream of the gene that would therefore seem sufficient for their expression in males.

Dmca1D(AR66) embryos hatch but pharate adults have difficulty eclosing. Those that do eclose have difficulty in fluid-filling of the wings.

Targeting to transcriptionally active loci by the hydrophilic N-terminal domain of Drosophila DNA topoisomerase I,9632819,10.1128/mcb.18.7.4358,"DNA topoisomerase I (topo I) from Drosophila melanogaster contains a nonconserved, hydrophilic N-terminal domain of about 430 residues upstream of the conserved core domains. Deletion of this N terminus did not affect the catalytic activity of topo I, while further removal of sequences into the conserved regions inactivated its enzymatic activity. We have investigated the cellular function of the Drosophila topo I N-terminal domain with top1-lacZ transgenes. There was at least one putative nuclear localization signal within the first 315 residues of the N-terminal domain that allows efficient import of the large chimeric proteins into Drosophila nuclei. The top1-lacZ fusion proteins colocalized with RNA polymerase II (pol II) at developmental puffs on the polytene chromosomes. Either topo I or the top1-lacZ fusion protein was colocalized with RNA pol II in some but not all of the nonpuff, interband loci. However, the fusion proteins as well as RNA pol II were recruited to heat shock puffs during heat treatment, and they returned to the developmental puffs after recovery from heat shock. By immunoprecipitation, we showed that two of the largest subunits of RNA pol II coprecipitated with the N-terminal 315-residue fusion protein by using antibodies against beta-galactosidase. These data suggest that the topo I fusion protein can be localized to the transcriptional complex on chromatin and that the N-terminal 315 residues were sufficient to respond to cellular processes, especially during the reprogramming of gene expression.",1998,"W L Shaiu, T S Hsieh, W L Shaiu, T S Hsieh"

We pursued the reason for this discrepancy and found that D. biarmipes males produce two different substances with ovulation-inducing activity. One of them is derived from the accessory glands and effective in females of all strains. Another originates in the ejaculatory duct and is inactive in some strains. In an active HPLC fraction of the ejaculatory duct extract, we found a peptide consisting of 32 amino acids.

Its transposition is controlled by a host gene called flamenco (flam): restrictive alleles of this gene maintain the retrovirus in a repressed state while permissive alleles allow high levels of transposition. To develop a cell system to study the gypsy element, we established four independent cell lines derived from the Drosophila strain SS, which contains a permissive allele of flamenco, and which is devoid of transposing copies of gypsy. The ultrastructural analysis of three SS cell lines revealed some remarkable characteristics, such as many nuclear virus-like particles, cytoplasmic dense particles, and massive cisternae filled with a fibrous material of unknown origin. Gypsy intragenomic distribution has been compared between the three cell lines and the original SS fly strain, and revealed in two of the cell lines an increase in copy number of a restriction fragment usually present in active gypsy elements. This multiplication seems to have occurred during the passage to the cell culture. Availability of SS cell lines should assist studies of gypsy transposition and infectivity and might be useful to produce high amounts of gypsy viral particles.

Light and temperature cooperate to regulate the circadian locomotor rhythm of wild type and period mutants of Drosophila melanogaster,12769941,10.1016/s0022-1910(98)00046-8,"In the wild type (Canton-S) and period mutant flies of Drosophila melanogaster, we examined the effects of light and temperature on the circadian locomotor rhythm. Under light dark cycles, the wild type and per(S) flies were diurnal at 25 degrees C. However, at 30 degrees C, the daytime activity commonly decreased to form a rather nocturnal pattern, and ultradian rhythms of a 2 approximately 4h period were observed more frequently than at 25 degrees C. The change in activity pattern was more clearly observed in per(0) flies, suggesting that these temperature dependent changes in activity pattern are mainly attributable to the system other than the circadian clock. In a 12h 30 degrees C:12h 25 degrees C temperature cycle (HTLT12:12), per(0) flies were active during the thermophase in constant darkness (DD) but during the cryophase in constant light (LL). The results of experiments with per(0);eya flies suggest that the compound eye is the main source of the photic information for this reversal. Wild type and per(0) flies were synchronized to HTLT12:12 both under LL and DD, while per(S) and per(L) flies were synchronized only in LL. This suggests that the circadian clock is entrainable to the temperature cycle, but the entrainability is reduced in the per(S) and per(L) flies to this particular thermoperiod length, and that temperature cycle forces the clock to move in LL, where the rhythm is believed to be stopped at constant temperature.",1998,"A Matsumoto, N Matsumoto, Y Harui, M Sakamoto, K Tomioka, A Matsumoto, N Matsumoto, Y Harui, M Sakamoto, K Tomioka"

To date some 70 mutations of the Drosophila Rh1 gene have been isolated, most of them have been characterized at the molecular level, and more than 60% of them cause retinal degeneration. This review lists the known Rh1 mutations that cause retinal degeneration up to April 1998, gives an overview on the ultrastructural and biochemical correlates of photoreceptor cell degeneration, and suggests a system for the classification of degeneration-causing Rh1 mutations.",1998,"J Bentrop, J Bentrop"
The evolutionary dynamics of sex determination,9748152,10.1126/science.281.5385.1990,"REVIEW There is substantial cytogenetic data indicating that the process of sex determination can evolve relatively rapidly. However, recent molecular studies on the evolution of the regulatory genes that control sex determination in the insect Drosophila melanogaster, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammals suggest that, although certain sex determination regulatory genes have evolved relatively rapidly, other sex determination regulatory genes are quite conserved. Thus, studies of the evolution of sex determination, a process that appears to have elements that undergo substantial evolutionary change and others that may be conserved, could provide substantial insights into the kinds of forces that both drive and constrain the evolution of developmental hierarchies.",1998,"I MarÃ­n, B S Baker, I MarÃ­n, B S Baker"
High affinity recognition of serotonin transporter antagonists defined by species-scanning mutagenesis. An aromatic residue in transmembrane domain I dictates species-selective recognition of citalopram and mazindol,9677366,10.1074/jbc.273.31.19459,"Human and Drosophila melanogaster serotonin (5-HT) transporters (SERTs) exhibit similar 5-HT transport kinetics and can be distinguished pharmacologically by many, but not all, biogenic amine transporter antagonists. By using human and Drosophila SERT chimeras, major determinants of potencies of two transporter antagonists, mazindol and citalopram, were tracked to the amino-terminal domains encompassing transmembrane domains I and II. Species-scanning mutagenesis, whereby amino acid substitutions are made switching residues from one species to another, was employed on the eight amino acids that differ between human and Drosophila SERTs in this region, and antagonist potencies were reassessed in 5-HT uptake assays. A single mutation in transmembrane domain I of human SERT, Y95F, shifted both citalopram and mazindol to Drosophila SERT-like potencies. Strikingly, these potency changes were in opposite directions suggesting Tyr95 contributes both positive and negative determinants of antagonist potency. To gain insight into how the Y95F mutant might influence mazindol potency, we determined how structural variants of mazindol responded to the mutation. Our studies demonstrate the importance of the hydroxyl group on the heterocyclic nucleus of mazindol for maintaining species-selective recognition of mazindol and suggest that transmembrane domain I participates in the formation of antagonist-binding sites for amine transporters.",1998,"E L Barker, M A Perlman, E M Adkins, W J Houlihan, Z B Pristupa, H B Niznik, R D Blakely, E L Barker, M A Perlman, E M Adkins, W J Houlihan, Z B Pristupa, H B Niznik, R D Blakely"
A genetically marked I element in Drosophila melanogaster can be mobilized when ORF2 is provided in trans,9475738,,"I factors in Drosophila melanogaster are non-LTR retrotransposons similar to mammalian LINEs. They transpose at very high frequencies in the germ line of SF females resulting from crosses between reactive females, devoid of active I factors, and inducer males, containing active I factors. The vermilion marked IviP2 element was designed to allow easy phenotypical screening for retrotransposition events. It is deleted in ORF2 and therefore cannot produce reverse transcriptase. IviP2 can be mobilized at very low frequencies by actively transposing I factors in the germ line of SF females. This paper shows that IviP2 can be mobilized more efficiently in the germ line of strongly reactive females in the absence of active I factors, when it is trans-complemented by the product of ORF2 synthesized from the hsp70 heat-shock promoter. This represents a promising step toward the use of marked I elements to study retrotransposition and as tools for mutagenesis.",1998,"I Busseau, S Malinsky, M Balakireva, M C Chaboissier, D Teninges, A Bucheton, I Busseau, S Malinsky, M Balakireva, M C Chaboissier, D Teninges, A Bucheton"
Drosophila acetylcholinesterase: effect of post-translational [correction of post-traductional] modifications on the production in the baculovirus system and substrate metabolization,9627407,10.1002/(SICI)1520-6327(1998)38:2<84::AID-ARCH4>3.0.CO;2-V,"Acetylcholinesterase cDNAs from Drosophila melanogaster modified on its primary sequence were cloned into baculovirus and were expressed in Sf9 cells with the aim to identify a mutant form that produces the enzyme at a high level. Directed mutagenesis was used in order to independently knockout different sites of post-translational modifications: exchange of the C-terminal hydrophobic peptide for a glycolipid molecule, dimerization by disulfide bridge, N-linked glycosylation at the five accessible sites, and subunit formation by proteolytic cleavage of a hydrophilic peptide found in the precursor. Another mutation involved the elimination of a free cysteine in the mature protein. All mutations involving post-translational modifications resulted in lower recoveries, suggesting that they are useful for maintaining high amounts of protein in the synapse. By contrast, elimination of a free cysteine in the mature protein permitted an increase in the level of production of the enzyme. These mutations did not affect specific activity of the enzyme at substrate concentrations ranging from 3 microM to 200 mM, suggesting that activation and inhibition of the enzyme activity does not originate from a polymorphism in post-translational modifications.",1998,"S Estrada-Mondaca, A Lougarre, D Fournier, S Estrada-Mondaca, A Lougarre, D Fournier"
Dopamine modulates female sexual receptivity in Drosophila melanogaster,10197160,10.3109/01677069809167259,"Newly eclosed Drosophila melanogaster flies were systemically depleted of dopamine by feeding an inhibitor of the biosynthetic enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase, and analyzed for abnormalities in courtship behavior. Dopamine-depleted females were significantly less receptive to males than were control females, although males were strongly attracted to treated females. The decrease in receptivity was reversed by the addition of L-DOPA (the product of the tyrosine hydroxylation reaction) to food containing the inhibitor. Male courtship behaviors were unaffected by this treatment. Female receptivity may be regulated via interactions with hormonal pathways, since depletion of dopamine levels via inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in Drosophila melanogaster adult females has established that dopamine is required for normal ovarian maturation and fecundity.",1998,"W S Neckameyer, W S Neckameyer"
"Identification and characterization of kraken, a gene encoding a putative hydrolytic enzyme in Drosophila melanogaster",9831651,10.1016/s0378-1119(98)00497-1,"Kraken, a novel Drosophila gene isolated from a 4-8-h-old Drosophila embryo cDNA library, shows homology to a family of serine hydrolases whose common feature is that they all catalyse breakage of substrates with a carbonyl-containing group. It is a single-copy gene with at least two introns and maps to position 21D on polytene chromosomes. kraken is a member of a conserved gene family. Messenger RNA of kraken is expressed ubiquitously in early embryogenesis. Later, it is concentrated in the foregut and the posterior midgut primordium. Towards the end of embryogenesis, expression of kraken is confined to the gastric caeca. During the third-instar larval stage, kraken is expressed at low levels in the gastric caeca and parts of the gut, and at higher levels in the fat body. We suggest a role for Kraken in detoxification and digestion during embryogenesis and larval development.",1998,"H Y Edwin Chan, S J Harris, C J O'Kane, H Y Edwin Chan, S J Harris, C J O'Kane"
Nitrilase and Fhit homologs are encoded as fusion proteins in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans,9671749,10.1073/pnas.95.15.8744,"The tumor suppressor gene FHIT encompasses the common human chromosomal fragile site at 3p14.2 and numerous cancer cell biallelic deletions. To study Fhit function we cloned and characterized FHIT genes from Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. Both genes code for fusion proteins in which the Fhit domain is fused with a novel domain showing homology to bacterial and plant nitrilases; the D. melanogaster fusion protein exhibited diadenosine triphosphate (ApppA) hydrolase activity expected of an authentic Fhit homolog. In human and mouse, the nitrilase homologs and Fhit are encoded by two different genes: FHIT and NIT1, localized on chromosomes 3 and 1 in human, and 14 and 1 in mouse, respectively. We cloned and characterized human and murine NIT1 genes and determined their exon-intron structure, patterns of expression, and alternative processing of their mRNAs. The tissue specificity of expression of murine Fhit and Nit1 genes was nearly identical. Because fusion proteins with dual or triple enzymatic activities have been found to carry out specific steps in a given biochemical or biosynthetic pathway, we postulate that Fhit and Nit1 likewise collaborate in a biochemical or cellular pathway in mammalian cells.",1998,"Y Pekarsky, M Campiglio, Z Siprashvili, T Druck, Y Sedkov, S Tillib, A Draganescu, P Wermuth, J H Rothman, K Huebner, A M Buchberg, A Mazo, C Brenner, C M Croce, Y Pekarsky, M Campiglio, Z Siprashvili, T Druck, Y Sedkov, S Tillib, A Draganescu, P Wermuth, J H Rothman, K Huebner, A M Buchberg, A Mazo, C Brenner, C M Croce"
"A dense genetic map of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, covering all chromosomes based on 1018 molecular markers",9832528,,"A dense linkage map was constructed for the silkworm, Bombyx mori, containing 1018 genetic markers on all 27 autosomes and the Z chromosome. Most of the markers, covering approximately 2000 cM, were randomly amplified polymorphic DNAs amplified with primer-pairs in combinations of 140 commercially available decanucleotides. In addition, eight known genes and five visible mutations were mapped. Bombyx homologues of engrailed and invected genes were found to be closely linked, as in Drosophila melanogaster. The average interval between markers was approximately 2 cM, equal to approximately 500 kb. The correspondence of seven linkage groups to counterparts of the conventional linkage map was determined. This map is the first linkage map in insects having a large number of chromosomes (n = 28) that covers all chromosomes without any gaps.",1998,"Y Yasukochi, Y Yasukochi"
"Molecular characterization of a retrotransposon in Drosophila melanogaster, nomad, and its relationship to other retrovirus-like mobile elements",9894909,10.1007/s004380050910,"The nomad element was identified as a retrovirus-like transposon in Drosophila melanogaster. DNA sequence analysis showed that the nomad element contains three long ORFs that are similar to the gag, pol and env genes of retrovirus- and the copia-like elements of D. melanogaster. The nomad element terminates with 519-bp terminal repeats, each of which contains eukaryotic consensus transcription initiation and termination signals. nomad elements are located at approximately 10-15 sites within the euchromatic arms of the genome and at the chromocenter, as shown by in situ hybridization. The host DNA sequence TANA was found to be duplicated on each side of the nomad element and appears to be a preferential target site for insertion of nomad elements. Analysis of the zinc finger motif in the pol gene product of retrotransposons known to have target site preference suggests involvement of the integrase subunit in target site selection for those retrotransposons that display insert site specificity. A comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the pol-like genes of several known retrotransposons was made and the phylogenetic relationship between nomad and other retrovirus-like mobile elements was determined. It was clear from this conceptual protein analysis and from analysis of their structural characteristics that retrotransposons of the gypsy class can be generally classified as members of one of two distinct groups. The phylogenetic relationships of these groups are also discussed.",1998,"J H Whalen, T A Grigliatti, J H Whalen, T A Grigliatti"
High rate of DNA loss in the Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis species groups,9501496,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025926,"We recently proposed that patterns of evolution of non-LTR retrotransposable elements can be used to study patterns of spontaneous mutation. Transposition of non-LTR retrotransposable elements commonly results in creation of 5' truncated, ""dead-on-arrival"" copies. These inactive copies are effectively pseudogenes and, according to the neutral theory, their molecular evolution ought to reflect rates and patterns of spontaneous mutation. Maximum parsimony can be used to separate the evolution of active lineages of a non-LTR element from the fate of the ""dead-on-arrival"" insertions and to directly assess the relative frequencies of different types of spontaneous mutations. We applied this approach using a non-LTR element, Helena, in the Drosophila virilis group and have demonstrated a surprisingly high incidence of large deletions and the virtual absence of insertions. Based on these results, we suggested that Drosophila in general may exhibit a high rate of spontaneous large deletions and have hypothesized that such a high rate of DNA loss may help to explain the puzzling dearth of bona fide pseudogenes in Drosophila. We also speculated that variation in the rate of spontaneous deletion may contribute to the divergence of genome size in different taxa by affecting the amount of superfluous ""junk"" DNA such as, for example, pseudogenes or long introns. In this paper, we extend our analysis to the D. melanogaster subgroup, which last shared a common ancestor with the D. virilis group approximately 40 MYA. In a different region of the same transposable element, Helena, we demonstrate that inactive copies accumulate deletions in species of the D. melanogaster subgroup at a rate very similar to that of the D. virilis group. These results strongly suggest that the high rate of DNA loss is a general feature of Drosophila and not a peculiar property of a particular stretch of DNA in a particular species group.",1998,"D A Petrov, D L Hartl, D A Petrov, D L Hartl"
Selective sweep of a newly evolved sperm-specific gene in Drosophila,9859991,10.1038/25126,"The pattern of genetic variation across the genome of Drosophila melanogaster is consistent with the occurrence of frequent 'selective sweeps', in which new favourable mutations become incorporated into the species so quickly that linked alleles can 'hitchhike' and also become fixed. Because of the hitchhiking of linked genes, it is generally difficult to identify the target of any putative selective sweep. Here, however, we identify a new gene in D. melanogaster that codes for a sperm-specific axonemal dynein subunit. The gene has a new testes-specific promoter derived from a protein-coding region in a gene encoding the cell-adhesion protein annexin X (AnnX), and it contains a new protein-coding exon derived from an intron in a gene encoding a cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain (Cdic). The new transcription unit, designated Sdic (for sperm-specific dynein intermediate chain), has been duplicated about tenfold in a tandem array. Consistent with the selective sweep of this gene, the level of genetic polymorphism near Sdic is unusually low. The discovery of this gene supports other results that point to the rapid molecular evolution of male reproductive functions.",1998,"D I Nurminsky, M V Nurminskaya, D De Aguiar, D L Hartl, D I Nurminsky, M V Nurminskaya, D De Aguiar, D L Hartl"
In vivo association of lamins with nucleic acids in Drosophila melanogaster,9394018,,"A 32P-labeling strategy was developed to study the interaction(s) in tissue culture cells between proteins and nucleic acids. Interphase and mitotic nuclear lamins were studied in Drosophila Kc cells. After bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and in vivo photo-crosslinking with 366 nm light, it was found that interphase lamins were associated with nucleic acid. Interactions with DNA as well as RNA were detected. In contrast, interaction of nucleic acids with mitotic lamin was not observed. Photo-crosslinking in the presence of antibiotics distamycin and/or chromomycin suggested that interphase lamins interacted with both A-T-rich DNA and G-C-rich DNA; interactions with G-C-rich DNA predominated. These results have implications for understanding the interphase organization of the higher eukaryotic cell nucleus as well as the transition of cells from interphase to mitosis. A model of nuclear organization, consistent with our results, is proposed.",1998,"R Rzepecki, S S Bogachev, E Kokoza, N Stuurman, P A Fisher, R Rzepecki, S S Bogachev, E Kokoza, N Stuurman, P A Fisher"
