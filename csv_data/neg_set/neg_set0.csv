The dorsal-open group gene raw is required for restricted DJNK signaling during closure,10518507,,"During dorsal closure in Drosophila melanogaster, cells of the lateral epidermis migrate over the amnioserosa to encase the embryo. At least three classes of dorsal-open group gene products are necessary for this morphogenetic movement. Class I genes code for structural proteins that effect changes in epidermal cell shape and motility. Class II and III genes code for regulatory components of closure: Class II genes encode Drosophila Jun amino (N)-terminal kinase (DJNK) signaling molecules and Class III genes encode Decapentaplegic-mediated signaling molecules. All characterized dorsal-open group gene products function in the epidermis. Here we report a molecular and genetic characterization of raw, a newly defined member of the Class II dorsal-open group genes. We show that the novel protein encoded by raw is required for restriction of DJNK signaling to leading edge epidermal cells as well as for proper development of the amnioserosa. Taken together, our results demonstrate a role for Raw in restriction of epidermal signaling during closure and suggest that this effect may be mediated via the amnioserosa.",1999,"C L Byars, K L Bates, A Letsou, C L Byars, K L Bates, A Letsou"
Drosophila replication and repair proteins: proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA),10455000,10.1006/meth.1999.0798,"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a protein intimately involved in both replication and repair, has been identified in eukaryotes at all levels of evolution. Is primary sequence, Drosophila melanogaster PCNA is 73% identical to mammalian PCNA. Moreover, it is able to substitute for mammalian PCNA in at least one intricate cell-free replication assay. Mutations in the gene for Drosophila PCNA, including some that are temperature sensitive, have been reported. Procedures are described for the biochemical purification of wild-type PCNA from a population of 6- to 18-h-old Drosophila embryos. Procedures were also developed for purification of unmodified wild-type Drosophila PCNA after induction of expression in Escherichia coli. An NH(2)-terminally His-tagged but otherwise wild-type Drosophila PCNA, as well as mutant His-tagged PCNA, were also engineered and purified to apparent homogeneity. Finally, an in situ polyacrylamide gel technique allows DNA polymerase assays to be performed on portions of single adults as well as single Drosophila embryos. This assay should tremendously facilitate systematic genetic studies of metazoan replication and repair.",1999,"D J Mozzherin, M McConnell, P A Fisher, D J Mozzherin, M McConnell, P A Fisher"
Ectopic overexpression of Drosophila lamin C is stage-specific lethal,10222127,10.1006/excr.1999.4396,"To gain insight into the function of the developmentally regulated A-type lamins we transformed Drosophila melanogaster with a construct containing the hsp70 promoter followed by the Drosophila lamin C (an analog of vertebrate A-type lamins) cDNA. Lamin C was expressed ectopically after heat shock of embryos and localized to the nucleus. No phenotypic change was observed after lamin C expression in embryos that normally do not contain lamin C. However, ectopic expression of lamin C during most larval (but not pupal) stages stalled growth, inhibited ecdysteroid signaling (in particular during the larval-prepupal transition), resulted in development of melanotic tumors, and finally caused death. During pupation in control animals, when massive apoptosis of larval tissues takes place, lamin C is proteolyzed into a fragment with a size similar to that predicted by caspase cleavage. The ectopically expressed lamin C is identically cleaved, resulting in a large increase of the steady-state level of the lamin C fragment. A null mutation of the dcp-1 gene, one of the two known Drosophila caspase genes, also results in development of melanotic tumors and larval death, suggesting that the ectopically expressed lamin C inhibits apoptosis through competitive inhibition of caspase activity.",1999,"N Stuurman, J P Delbecque, P Callaerts, U Aebi, N Stuurman, J P Delbecque, P Callaerts, U Aebi"
Unusual haplotype structure at the proximal breakpoint of In(2L)t in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster,10545460,,"The existence of temporally stable frequency clines for In(2L)t in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster suggests a role for selection in the maintenance of this polymorphism. We have collected nucleotide polymorphism data from the proximal breakpoint junction regions of In(2L)t to infer its evolutionary history. The finding of a novel LINE-like element near the In(2L)t breakpoint junction in sampled inverted chromosomes supports a transposable element-mediated origin for this inversion. An analysis of nucleotide variation in a Costa Rican population sample of standard and inverted chromosomes indicates a unique and relatively recent origin for In(2L)t. Additional In(2L)t alleles from three geographically diverse populations reveal no detectable geographic differentiation. Low levels of In(2L)t nucleotide polymorphism suggest a recent increase in the inversion's frequency in tropical populations. An unusual feature of our sample of standard alleles is a marked heterogeneity in levels of linkage disequilibrium among polymorphic sites across the breakpoint region. We introduce a test of neutral equilibrium haplotype structure that corrects both for multiple tests and for an arbitrarily chosen window size. It reveals that an approximately 1.4-kb region immediately spanning the breakpoint has fewer haplotypes than expected under the neutral model, given the expected level of recombination in this genomic region. Certain features of our data suggest that the unusual pattern in standard chromosomes is the product of selection rather than demography.",1999,"P Andolfatto, J D Wall, M Kreitman, P Andolfatto, J D Wall, M Kreitman"

Stress is often considered to increase both the asymmetry and phenotypic variability of bilateral traits, although this may depend on trait heritability. Empirical studies of such associations often yield inconsistent results. This may reflect the diversity of traits and conditions used or a low repeatability of any associations. To test for repeatable associations between these variables, multiply replicated experiments were undertaken on Drosophila melanogaster using a combination stress at the egg, larval and adult stages of reduced protein, ethanol in the medium, and a cold shock. Both metric and meristic traits were measured and levels of heritable variation for each trait estimated by maximum likelihood and parent-offspring regression over three generations. Trait means were reduced by stress, whereas among-individual variation increased Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) was increased by stress in some cases, but few comparisons were significant. Only one trait orbital bristle, showed consistent increases in FA. Changes in trait means, trait phenotypic variability, and developmental stability as a result of stress were not correlated. Extreme phenotypes tended to have higher levels of FA but only the results for orbital bristles were significant. All traits had low to intermediate heritabilities except orbital bristle, which showed no heritable variation. Only traits with low heritability and high levels of phenotypic variability may show consistent increases in FA under stress. Overall, the independence of phenotypic variability, plasticity, and the developmental stability of traits extend to changes in these measures under stressful conditions.",1999,"Richard E Woods, Carla M SgrÃ², Miriam J Hercus, Ary A Hoffmann, Richard E Woods, Carla M SgrÃ², Miriam J Hercus, Ary A Hoffmann"
Nucleotide variation at the runt locus in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,10368951,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026157,"Intra- and interspecific nucleotide variation for the major developmental gene runt in Drosophila was studied in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. The 1.5-kb protein-coding region and the 0.4-kb intron of the runt gene were sequenced for 11 alleles in each species. The D. melanogaster alleles originated from east Africa. Estimated parameters of intraspecific variation in D. melanogaster (exons: theta = 0.018, pi = 0.018; intron: theta = 0.014, pi = 0.014) and D. simulans (exons: theta = 0.007, pi = 0.005; intron: theta = 0.008, pi = 0.005) were below average for other X-linked genes, while divergence between species (exons: D = 0.094; intron: D = 0.069) fell within the normal range for both silent and replacement changes. This estimate for runt, along with published values for three other genes in regions of normal recombination, show east African D. melanogaster to be roughly twice as polymorphic as D. simulans. The majority of nucleotide variation, silent and replacement, in both species was found to be selectively neutral using various statistical tests (HKA, McDonald-Kreitman, Tajima, and Fu and Li tests). Monte Carlo simulations of the coalescent process significantly rejected a Wright-Fisher model with respect to an amino acid polymorphism and the distribution of polymorphic sites among the D. simulans lines.

Sequences within the YAC clone are conserved in the centromeric region of the sibling species Drosophila simulans.

Extensive zygotic control of the anteroposterior axis in the wasp Nasonia vitripennis,9895318,,"Insect axis formation is best understood in Drosophila melanogaster, where rapid anteroposterior patterning of zygotic determinants is directed by maternal gene products.

Nasonia is advantageous for identifying and studying recessive zygotic lethal mutations because unfertilized eggs develop as males while fertilized eggs develop as females. Here we describe recessive zygotic mutations identifying three Nasonia genes: head only mutant embryos have posterior defects, resembling loss of both maternal and zygotic Drosophila caudal function; headless mutant embryos have anterior and posterior gap defects, resembling loss of both maternal and zygotic Drosophila hunchback function; squiggy mutant embryos develop only four full trunk segments, a phenotype more severe than those caused by lack of Drosophila maternal or zygotic terminal gene functions.

Functional conservation of the wingless-engrailed interaction as shown by a widely applicable baculovirus misexpression system,10574758,10.1016/s0960-9822(00)80050-0,"Background:
      
    

    
      The expression patterns of the segment polarity genes wingless and engrailed are conserved during segmentation in a variety of arthropods, suggesting that the regulatory interactions between these two genes are also evolutionarily conserved. Hypotheses derived from such comparisons of gene expression patterns are difficult to test experimentally as genetic manipulation is currently possible for only a few model organisms.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We have developed a system, using recombinant baculoviruses, that can be applied to a wide variety of organisms to study the effects of ectopic expression of genes. As a first step, we studied the range and type of infection of several reporter viruses in the embryos of two arthropod and one vertebrate species. Using this system to express wingless, we were able to induce expression of engrailed in the anterior half of each parasegment in embryos of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Virus-mediated wingless expression also caused ectopic naked ventral cuticle formation in wild-type Drosophila larvae. In the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, ectopic wingless also induced engrailed expression. As in Drosophila, this expression was only detectable in the anterior half of the parasegment.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The functional interaction between wingless and engrailed, and the establishment of cells competent to express engrailed, appears to be conserved between Drosophila and Tribolium. The data on the establishment of an engrailed-competent domain also support the idea that prepatterning by pair-rule genes is conserved between these two insects. The recombinant baculovirus technology reported here may help answer other long-standing comparative evolutionary questions.",1999,"D I Oppenheimer, A M MacNicol, N H Patel, D I Oppenheimer, A M MacNicol, N H Patel"
[A statistical study of the growth and morphogenesis of axillary apparatus and notum in the Pth mutants of Drosophila],10576056,,"The regularities of morphogenesis of the ventral wing-hinge structures in the Pth mutants of Drosophila melanogaster were studied using statistical methods. Our views on the vectorial growth of presumptive wing hinge as an entire unity were independently confirmed using statistical methods. The expected duplication forms, the possibility of their one-dimensional classification, the expected number of possible types, and other aspects of duplication were discussed in view of other possible suggestions on the growth of the ventral wing hinge. The growth of the anterior half of the pteropleurum was shown to have a rigid organization, because it can be described as a function of one variable. The growth was shown to be exponential. The empirical formula that fits experimental data with a significance of 99.99% was chosen. The relationship between the presumptive ventral wing hinge and the presumptive notum in respect of growth was shown to be statistical (the coefficient of correlation r = 0.37) rather than functional. Therefore, such a morphologically united formation as the wing imaginal disk does not have a unified growth pattern.

"TONDU (TDU), a novel human protein related to the product of vestigial (vg) gene of Drosophila melanogaster interacts with vertebrate TEF factors and substitutes for Vg function in wing formation",10518497,,"The mammalian TEF and the Drosophila scalloped genes belong to a conserved family of transcriptional factors that possesses a TEA/ATTS DNA-binding domain. Transcriptional activation by these proteins likely requires interactions with specific coactivators. In Drosophila, Scalloped (Sd) interacts with Vestigial (Vg) to form a complex, which binds DNA through the Sd TEA/ATTS domain. The Sd-Vg heterodimer is a key regulator of wing development, which directly controls several target genes and is able to induce wing outgrowth when ectopically expressed. Here we show that Vg contains two distinct transcriptional activation domains, suggesting that the function of Vg is to mediate transcriptional activation by Sd. By expressing a chimeric GAL4-Sd protein in Drosophila, we found that the transcriptional activity of the Vg-Sd heterodimer is negatively regulated at the AP and DV boundary of the wing disc. We also identify a novel human protein, TONDU, which contains a short domain homologous to the domain of Vg required for interaction with Sd. We show that TONDU specifically interacts with a domain conserved in all the mammalian TEF factors. Expression of TDU in Drosophila by means of the UAS-GAL4 system shows that this human protein can substitute for Vg in wing formation.

We have completed a phylogenetic analysis of 15 DSL proteins from eight species. Our findings reveal that at least one gene duplication occurred prior to the divergence of the Drosophila melanogaster and vertebrate lineages, with subsequent duplications in vertebrates. The three known Caenorhabditis elegans proteins likely arose by two independent duplications in the nematode lineage. Analysis of EGF repeats suggests that EGF 2 has been conserved among DSL proteins in vertebrates and D. melanogaster. The sequences of two EGF repeats have been perfectly conserved in vertebrate orthologs: EGF 2 in Delta and EGF 15 in Jagged/Serrate.

Circadian rhythms in olfactory responses of Drosophila melanogaster,10432117,10.1038/22566,"The core mechanism of circadian timekeeping in arthropods and vertebrates consists of feedback loops involving several clock genes, including period (per) and timeless (tim). In the fruitfly Drosophila, circadian oscillations in per expression occur in chemosensory cells of the antennae, even when the antennae are excised and maintained in isolated organ culture. Here we demonstrate a robust circadian rhythm in Drosophila in electrophysiological responses to two classes of olfactory stimuli. These rhythms are observed in wild-type flies during light-dark cycles and in constant darkness, but are abolished in per or tim null-mutant flies (per01 and tim01) which lack rhythms in adult emergence and locomotor behaviour. Olfactory rhythms are also abolished in the per 7.2:2 transgenic line in which per expression is restricted to the lateral neurons of the optic lobe. Because per 7.2:2 flies do not express per in peripheral oscillators, our results provide evidence that peripheral circadian oscillators are necessary for circadian rhythms in olfactory responses. As olfaction is essential for food acquisition, social interactions and predator avoidance in many animals, circadian regulation of olfactory systems could have profound effects on the behaviour of organisms that rely on this sensory modality.",1999,"B Krishnan, S E Dryer, P E Hardin, B Krishnan, S E Dryer, P E Hardin"

Response of Djun and Dfos mRNA abundance to signal transduction pathways in cultured cells of Drosophila melanogaster,10532309,10.1023/a:1006906419110,"The mammalian proto-oncogenes c-jun and c-fos are situated at the end of multiple signal transduction pathways and activation of their products Jun and Fos, components of the transcription factor AP-1, are able to regulate gene transcription in response to extracellular stimuli. Djun and Dfos, the products of the Drosophila proto-oncongenes Djun and Dfos, are similar in size and sequence to their mammalian counterparts c-Jun and c-Fos and are related to their mammalian counterparts by their antigenic properties. However, very little is known about how they are regulated through signal transduction pathways. This paper has investigated the response of their mRNA abundance levels to three signal transduction pathways in Drosophila cultured cells. Various agonists and antagonists that stimulate and inhibit specific enzymes in the pathways have been tested. The results suggest that Djun and Dfos mRNA are continuously expressed and their abundance levels are transiently regulated by multiple signaling pathways, the peak response coming at 1-2 hours after perturbation. Dfos is more highly regulated than Djun which is only modulated. The receptor tyrosine kinase pathways positively regulate Dfos and Djun. The cAMP-mediated pathway positively regulates Dfos but negatively regulates Djun.

This region covers 69 chromosome polytene bands on chromosome arm 2L, including the genetically well-characterized ""Adh region."" A computational analysis of the sequence predicts 218 protein-coding genes, 11 tRNAs, and 17 transposable element sequences. At least 38 of the protein-coding genes are arranged in clusters of from 2 to 6 closely related genes, suggesting extensive tandem duplication. The gene density is one protein-coding gene every 13 kb; the transposable element density is one element every 171 kb. Of 73 genes in this region identified by genetic analysis, 49 have been located on the sequence; P-element insertions have been mapped to 43 genes. Ninety-five (44%) of the known and predicted genes match a Drosophila EST, and 144 (66%) have clear similarities to proteins in other organisms. Genes known to have mutant phenotypes are more likely to be represented in cDNA libraries, and far more likely to have products similar to proteins of other organisms, than are genes with no known mutant phenotype. Over 650 chromosome aberration breakpoints map to this chromosome region, and their nonrandom distribution on the genetic map reflects variation in gene spacing on the DNA. This is the first large-scale analysis of the genome of D. melanogaster at the sequence level.

Drosophila song as a species-specific mating signal and the behavioural importance of Kyriacou & Hall cycles in D. melanogaster song,10479381,10.1006/anbe.1999.1167,"'Species-specific' mating signals may not make a significant contribution to sexual isolation if differences between species are not matched by narrowly tuned differences in female preferences. The courtship song of the melanogaster species group of Drosophila has been studied by several researchers as a potential factor in sexual isolation, but there are few clear demonstrations that species differences are behaviourally significant. We played synthetic song with typical pulse interval parameters for D. melanogaster, D. simulans or D. sechellia to D. melanogaster or D. simulans females in the presence of mute males. Females mated most quickly when stimulated by song typical of their own species, confirming that song can influence sexual isolation between these species. This effect was greater in D. melanogaster than D. simulans, which correlates with reduced variability in mean interpulse interval within D. melanogaster. We also examined the role of 'Kyriacou & Hall cycles' (periodic cycling of mean interpulse intervals) in D. melanogaster. Contrary to some predictions, the presence of the Kyriacou & Hall cycle was more important in increasing mating speed than the increased variability of interpulse intervals that is inevitably present in song containing a cycle. The large stimulatory effect of cycles on mating speed is curious, given that the periodicity of cycles would probably be difficult for females to detect during courtship in field conditions.

Microspatial genetic differentiation for tolerance and utilization of various alcohols and acetic acid in Drosophila species from India,10761109,10.1023/a:1003815626258,"In five Indian localities, it was possible to collect D. melanogaster in two different types of habitats, namely ordinary domestic and alcohol rich ones. Tolerance and utilization capacity of several alcohols and of acetic acid were analyzed in a total of 10 local populations. Results on two other species (D. repleta and D. immigrans) were also available from one place. In each locality, the population from alcohol rich habitat proved to be more tolerant to all the investigated products and also to be more capable of using them as a resource. Alcohols toxicity increased with increasing carbon chain length and secondary alcohols were more toxic than primary ones. Utilization capacity of all products was relatively independent of their toxicity. Especially acetic acid, the toxicity of which was low and similar to that of ethanol, was always a fairly poor resource. From a genetic point of view, tolerance and utilization capacity appeared as two relatively independent traits. Natural selection, which is responsible for the genetic differentiation of local populations, is likely to act simultaneously on both traits.",1999,"D Karan, R Parkash, J R David, D Karan, R Parkash, J R David"
[Modification of the repair processes in chemical mutagenesis in Drosophila melanogaster],10519070,,"The effect of 1,4-dihydroisonicotinic acid derivative (1,4-DHINA), glutapyrone, on the frequency of sex-linked recessive lethals (SLRL), which were induced by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) in spermatozoa, was studied in Drosophila males and females under different exposure conditions. This test was used to analyze repair processes in EMS mutagenesis. Glutapyrone manifested the protective effect after precultivation of males at the stage of larvae and females with glutapyrone. This preparation was shown to have no effect on the frequency of EMS-induced mutations under other conditions (precultivation and subsequent cultivation of mature males with glutapyrone). These data confirmed a key role of indirect mechanisms responsible for the effect of the examined antimutagen. Glutapyrone may be assumed to improve the synthesis or functioning of enzymes involved in the repair of O6-ethylguanine.

ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FEEDING RATE AND PARASITOID RESISTANCE IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,28565507,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1999.tb04544.x,"Replicate lines of Drosophila melanogaster have been selected for increased resistance against one of two species of parasitoid wasp, Asobara tabida and Leptopilina boulardi. In both cases, it has been shown that an improved ability to mount an immunological defense against the parasitoid's egg is associated with reduced survival when the larvae are reared under conditions of low resource availability and thus high competition. We show here that in both sets of selected lines, lower competitive ability is associated with reduced rates of larval feeding, as measured by the frequency of retractions of the cephalopharyngeal skeleton. This suggests that the same or similar physiological processes are involved in the trade-off between competition and resistance against either parasitoid and shows how the interaction between adaptations for competition and natural enemy resistance may be mediated.",1999,"M D E Fellowes, A R Kraaijeveld, H C J Godfray, M D E Fellowes, A R Kraaijeveld, H C J Godfray"
Organization of the ferritin genes in Drosophila melanogaster,10619605,10.1089/104454999314791,"The organization of two closely clustered genes, Fer1HCH and Fer2LCH, encoding the heavy-chain homolog (HCH) and the light-chain homolog (LCH) subunits of Drosophila melanogaster ferritin are reported here. The 5019-bp sequence of the cluster was assembled from genomic fragments obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA and from sequences obtained from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) (http://www.fruitfly.org). These genes, located at position 99F1, have different exon-intron structures (Fer1HCH has three introns and Fer2LCH has two introns) and are divergently transcribed. Computer analysis of the possibly shared promoter regions revealed the presence of putative metal regulatory elements (MREs), a finding consistent with the upregulation of these genes by iron, and putative NF-kappaB-like binding sites. The structure of two other invertebrate ferritin genes, from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (located on chromosomes I and V), was also analyzed. Both nematode genes have two introns, lack iron-responsive elements (IREs), and encode ferritin subunits similar to vertebrate H chains. These findings, along with comparisons of ferritin genes from invertebrates, vertebrates, and plants, suggest that the specialization of ferritin H and L type chains, the complex exon-intron organization of plant and vertebrate genes, and the use of the IRE/iron regulatory protein (IRP) mechanism for regulation of ferritin synthesis are recent evolutionary acquisitions.",1999,"B C Dunkov, T Georgieva, B C Dunkov, T Georgieva"
Effect of hydroquinone on meiotic segregation in Drosophila melanogaster females,10984682,10.1016/s1383-5718(00)00082-6,"The induction of sex chromosomes meiotic nondisjunction (ND) by hydroquinone (HQ) given orally was investigated in Drosophila melanogaster 2-7, 8-22, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h-old females. ND was assessed by a system where exceptional females (XXY) and only 1/4 of the expected regular progeny are viable. Oocytes were treated at different stages of development. 4% HQ tested only in 72 h-old females induced ND in oocytes sampled in brood I (mostly mature oocytes at metaphase I). 6% HQ increased ND in brood I of 8-22 h-old females, while other broods, (including cells treated at early prophase) were also affected in older flies, the highest significance being attained in the 48 h-old series. Newly hatched females (2-7 h-old) were refractory to the treatment, though oocytes sampled in the first three subcultures are comparable to cells showing enhancement of ND in series run with older females. Toxicity of 2, 4 and 6% HQ increased with concentration and females' age: (a) 2% was not toxic; (b) 4% was toxic only to 72 h-old females; (c) 6% was increasingly toxic to females 24, 48 and 72 h-old. The results indicate that age plays a significant role on both chromosomal segregation and toxicity and suggest that in Drosophila HQ is metabolized to its reactive species. The lack of toxic and aneugenic effect in very young females could reflect a more efficient detoxification due to the known high specific activity of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) after eclosion. The decline in GST activity around day 2 of adult life coincides with the high effect of HQ in 48 h-old females.",2000,"E R MuÃ±oz, B M Barnett, E R MuÃ±oz, B M Barnett"

Comparison between D. lebanonensis and D. melanogaster structures showed that there is almost no amino-acid change near the substrate or coenzyme binding sites and that the hydrophobic active site cavity is strictly conserved. Nevertheless, substitutions are not distributed at random in nonconstricted positions, or located in external loops, but they appear clustered mainly in secondary structure elements. From comparisons between D. melanogaster allozymes and with D. simulans, a very closely related species, a model based on changes in the electrostatic potential distribution is presented to explain their differential behavior.

Nucleotide excision repair endonuclease genes in Drosophila melanogaster,10812334,10.1016/s0921-8777(99)00075-0,"Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is the primary pathway for the removal of ultraviolet light-induced damage and bulky adducts from DNA in eukaryotes. During NER, the helix is unwound around the damaged site, and incisions are made on the 5' and 3' sides, to release an oligonucleotide carrying the lesion. Repair synthesis can then proceed, using the intact strand as a template. The incisions flanking the lesion are catalyzed by different structure-specific endonucleases. The 5' incision is made by a heterodimer of XPF and ERCC1 (Rad1p-Rad10p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and the 3' incision is made by XPG (Rad2p in S. cerevisiae). We previously showed that the Drosophila XPF homologue is encoded by the meiotic recombination gene mei-9. We report here the identification of the genes encoding the XPG and ERCC1 homologues (XPG(Dm) and ERCC1(Dm)). XPG(Dm) is encoded by the mus201 gene; we found frameshift mutations predicted to produce truncated XPG(Dm) proteins in each of two mus201 alleles. These mutations cause defects in nucleotide excision repair and hypersensitivity to alkylating agents and ultraviolet light, but do not cause hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and do not impair viability or fertility. ERCC1(Dm) interacts strongly in a yeast two-hybrid assay with MEI-9, indicative of the presumed requirement for these polypeptides to dimerize to form the functional endonuclease. The Drosophila Ercc1 gene maps to polytene region 51D1-2.

By examining potential hydrogen bonding sites in the major groove, we identified a 14-bp palindromic pattern centered on the 8-bp target site duplication that is generated by P element insertion.

"Neurotransmitter levels and synaptic strength at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction are not altered by mutation in the sluggish-A gene, which encodes proline oxidase and affects adult locomotion",10992167,10.3109/01677060009083481,"The sluggish-A (slgA) gene of Drosophila melanogaster has been shown to encode for the enzyme proline oxidase, a mitochondrial enzyme which catalyzes the first step in the conversion of L-proline to L-glutamate. The slgA transcript is expressed in both larval and adult Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations in this gene lead to reduced proline oxidase activity and an elevation of free proline levels. Adult mutant flies show a striking reduction of motor activity. Since proline oxidase may contribute to the supply of the neurotransmitter glutamate in the nervous system, a reduction in proline oxidase activity could reduce neural glutamate pools and affect synaptic transmission in neurons utilizing glutamate as a transmitter, including peripheral motor neurons. We tested the hypothesis that glutamate, and synaptic transmission mediated by glutamate, are reduced at synapses of glutamatergic motor neurons in slgA mutants. Levels of glutamate and proline in different cell compartments, and functional properties of synaptic transmission were compared in slgA and control specimens. Proline is elevated in muscle cells of slgA mutants, indicating that the slgA gene regulates tissue proline levels. In nerve terminal varicosities, proline levels were low in both mutants and controls. Glutamate levels in nerve terminal varicosities of slgA mutants and controls were similar. In addition, we found that glutamatergic synaptic transmission at individual nerve endings and at the whole-cell level was similar in slgA mutants and controls. Thus, proline oxidase does not play a major role in generating neuronal glutamate pools at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction, and larval neuromuscular performance is not altered significantly in slgA mutants.

It is caused by loss of FMR1 gene activity due to either lack of expression or expression of a mutant form of the protein. In mammals, FMR1 is a member of a small protein family that consists of FMR1, FXR1, and FXR2. All three members bind RNA and contain sequence motifs that are commonly found in RNA-binding proteins, including two KH domains and an RGG box. The FMR1/FXR proteins also contain a 60S ribosomal subunit interaction domain and a protein-protein interaction domain which mediates homomer and heteromer formation with each family member. Nevertheless, the specific molecular functions of FMR1/FXR proteins are unknown. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a Drosophila melanogaster homolog of the mammalian FMR1/FXR gene family. This first invertebrate homolog, termed dfmr1, has a high degree of amino acid sequence identity/similarity with the defined functional domains of the FMR1/FXR proteins. The dfmr1 product binds RNA and is similar in subcellular localization and embryonic expression pattern to the mammalian FMR1/FXR proteins. Overexpression of dfmr1 driven by the UAS-GAL4 system leads to apoptotic cell loss in all adult Drosophila tissues examined. This phenotype is dependent on the activity of the KH domains.

Regulation of proboscipedia in Drosophila by homeotic selector genes,10978284,,"The gene proboscipedia (pb) is a member of the Antennapedia complex in Drosophila and is required for the proper specification of the adult mouthparts. In the embryo, pb expression serves no known function despite having an accumulation pattern in the mouthpart anlagen that is conserved across several insect orders. We have identified several of the genes necessary to generate this embryonic pattern of expression. These genes can be roughly split into three categories based on their time of action during development. First, prior to the expression of pb, the gap genes are required to specify the domains where pb may be expressed. Second, the initial expression pattern of pb is controlled by the combined action of the genes Deformed (Dfd), Sex combs reduced (Scr), cap'n'collar (cnc), and teashirt (tsh). Lastly, maintenance of this expression pattern later in development is dependent on the action of a subset of the Polycomb group genes. These interactions are mediated in part through a 500-bp regulatory element in the second intron of pb. We further show that Dfd protein binds in vitro to sequences found in this fragment. This is the first clear demonstration of autonomous positive cross-regulation of one Hox gene by another in Drosophila melanogaster and the binding of Dfd to a cis-acting regulatory element indicates that this control might be direct.",2000,"D B Rusch, T C Kaufman, D B Rusch, T C Kaufman"

When immigrants were outbred, the mean frequency of the immigrant allele was significantly higher than its initial frequency, in both the first and second generations after immigration. There was no significant change in allele frequency for populations receiving inbred immigrants. The increase in allele frequency for outbred immigrants was attributed to an initial outbred vigour fitness advantage of immigrant males over resident males experiencing inbreeding depression. Hybrid vigour of immigrant progeny and the rare-male effect did not have a statistically significant role in the fitness advantage of the immigrant allele.

These results predict the existence of a tipE ortholog in the house fly. Using a PCR-based homology probing approach, we isolated cDNA clones encoding an ortholog of tipE (designated Vssc beta) from adult house fly heads. Clones comprising 3444 bp of cDNA sequence contained a 1317 bp open-reading frame encoding a 438 amino acid protein. The predicted Vssc beta protein exhibited 72% amino acid sequence identity to the entire D. melanogaster tipE protein sequence and 97% identity within the two hydrophobic segments identified as probable transmembrane domains.

A test of translational selection at 'silent' sites in the human genome: base composition comparisons in alternatively spliced genes,11164041,10.1016/s0378-1119(00)00482-0,"Natural selection appears to discriminate among synonymous codons to enhance translational efficiency in a wide range of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Codon bias is strongly related to gene expression levels in these species. In addition, between-gene variation in silent DNA divergence is inversely correlated with codon bias. However, in mammals, between-gene comparisons are complicated by distinctive nucleotide-content bias (isochores) throughout the genome. In this study, we attempted to identify translational selection by analyzing the DNA sequences of alternatively spliced genes in humans and in Drosophila melanogaster. Among codons in an alternatively spliced gene, those in constitutively expressed exons are translated more often than those in alternatively spliced exons. Thus, translational selection should act more strongly to bias codon usage and reduce silent divergence in constitutive than in alternative exons. By controlling for regional forces affecting base-composition evolution, this within-gene comparison makes it possible to detect codon selection at synonymous sites in mammals. We found that GC-ending codons are more abundant in constitutive than alternatively spliced exons in both Drosophila and humans. Contrary to our expectation, however, silent DNA divergence between mammalian species is higher in constitutive than in alternative exons.",2000,"K Iida, H Akashi, K Iida, H Akashi"

The correlation between intron length and recombination in drosophila. Dynamic equilibrium between mutational and selective forces,11063693,,"Intron length is negatively correlated with recombination in both Drosophila melanogaster and humans. This correlation is not likely to be the result of mutational processes alone: evolutionary analysis of intron length polymorphism in D. melanogaster reveals equivalent ratios of deletion to insertion in regions of high and low recombination. The polymorphism data do reveal, however, an excess of deletions relative to insertions (i.e., a deletion bias), with an overall deletion-to-insertion events ratio of 1.35. We propose two types of selection favoring longer intron lengths. First, the natural mutational bias toward deletion must be opposed by strong selection in very short introns to maintain the minimum intron length needed for the intron splicing reaction. Second, selection will favor insertions in introns that increase recombination between mutations under the influence of selection in adjacent exons. Mutations that increase recombination, even slightly, will be selectively favored because they reduce interference among selected mutations. Interference selection acting on intron length mutations must be very weak, as indicated by frequency spectrum analysis of Drosophila intron length polymorphism, making the equilibrium for intron length sensitive to changes in the recombinational environment and population size. One consequence of this sensitivity is that the advantage of longer introns is expected to decrease inversely with the rate of recombination, thus leading to a negative correlation between intron length and recombination rate. Also in accord with this model, intron length differs between closely related Drosophila species, with the longest variant present more often in D. melanogaster than in D. simulans. We suggest that the study of the proposed dynamic model, taking into account interference among selected sites, might shed light on many aspects of the comparative biology of genome sizes including the C value paradox.",2000,"J M Comeron, M Kreitman, J M Comeron, M Kreitman"

Response of Drosophila melanogaster to selection for P450-mediated resistance to isoquinoline alkaloids,10699570,10.1016/s0009-2797(99)00161-1,"Several species of columnar cacti in the Sonoran Desert contain isoquinoline alkaloids that are toxic to all but the resident drosophilids that feed and breed in necrotic stems. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are known to be involved in the metabolic detoxification of these alkaloids by the desert Drosophila and are consequently responsible for their ability to utilize these substrates. D. melanogaster is not normally exposed to these xenobiotic compounds and cannot live in necrotic cactus tissue. However, a previous study found evidence of a phenobarbital-inducible P450 in adults of this species that is capable of metabolizing cactus alkaloids. The current investigation sought to determine whether D. melanogaster responds to selection for alkaloid resistance. Significant increases in larval viability and adult longevity as well as shorter larvae-to-adult development times were observed after 16 generations of selection on medium containing isoquinoline alkaloids. The selected lines that exhibited a positive response can now be used to assay for changes in gene regulation as a possible mechanism of their response. This information will contribute to the understanding of evolution of P450-mediated resistance in insects.",2000,"J C Fogleman, J C Fogleman"
Origin and evolution of the regulatory gene male-specific lethal-3,10908644,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026407,"Dosage compensation in Drosophila is mediated by genes known as ""male-specific lethals"" (msls). Several msls, including male-specific lethal-3 (msl-3), encode proteins of unknown function. We cloned the Drosophila virilis msl-3 gene. Using the information provided by the sequences of the Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis genes, we found that sequences of other species can be aligned along their entire lengths with msl-3. Among them, there are genes in yeasts (the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Alp13 gene, as well as a putative Alp13 homolog, found in Saccharomyces cerevisae) and in mammals (MRG15 and MSL3L1 and their relatives) plus uncharacterized sequences of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the plants Arabidopsis thaliana, Lycopersicon esculentum, and Zea mays. A second Drosophila gene of this family has also been found. It is thus likely that msl-3-like genes are present in all eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that msl-3 is orthologous to the mammalian MSL3L1 genes, while the second Drosophila melanogaster gene (which we have called Dm MRG15) is orthologous to mammalian MRG15. These analyses also suggest that the msl-3/MRG15 duplication occurred after the fungus/animal split, while an independent duplication occurred in plants. The proteins encoded by these genes have similar structures, including a putative chromodomain close to their N-terminal end and a putative leucine zipper at their C-terminus. The possible functional roles of these proteins are discussed.",2000,"I MarÃ­n, B S Baker, I MarÃ­n, B S Baker"

Apoptotic network is one kind of typical regulatory networks. EGL1, CED3, CED4, CED9 and their homologous proteins play essential roles in apoptosis of C.elegans and mammals, and were regarded as the components of the""core apoptotic engine"". But in fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, this network is incomplete. A series of bioinformatic analyses found the lost chains of ""core apoptotic engine"" by discovering two homologues of BCL2/CED9 and one of EGL1 in fruit fly genome sequences.

Promoter-proximal pausing on the hsp70 promoter in Drosophila melanogaster depends on the upstream regulator,10713179,10.1128/mcb.20.7.2569-2580.2000,"RNA polymerase II pauses in the promoter-proximal region of many genes during transcription. In the case of the hsp70 promoter from Drosophila melanogaster, this pause is long-lived and occurs even when the gene is not induced. Paused polymerase escapes during heat shock when the transcriptional activator heat shock factor associates with the promoter. However, pausing is still evident, especially when induction is at an intermediate level. Yeast Gal4 protein (Gal4p) will induce transcription of the hsp70 promoter in Drosophila when binding sites for Gal4p are positioned upstream from the hsp70 TATA element. To further our understanding of promoter-proximal pausing, we have analyzed the effect of Gal4p on promoter-proximal pausing in salivary glands of Drosophila larvae. Using permanganate genomic footprinting, we observed that various levels of Gal4p induction resulted in an even distribution of RNA polymerase throughout the first 76 nucleotides of the transcribed region. In contrast, promoter-proximal pausing still occurs on endogenous and transgenic hsp70 promoters in salivary glands when these promoters are induced by heat shock. We also determined that mutations introduced into the region where the polymerase pauses do not inhibit pausing in a cell-free system. Taken together, these results indicate that promoter-proximal pausing is dictated by the regulatory proteins interacting upstream from the core promoter region.",2000,"H Tang, Y Liu, L Madabusi, D S Gilmour, H Tang, Y Liu, L Madabusi, D S Gilmour"
Temporal and spatial expression of the cell-cycle regulator cul-1 in Drosophila and its stimulation by radiation-induced apoptosis,10952875,,"Cul-1 protein is part of the ubiquitin ligase complex that is conserved from yeast to humans. This complex specifically marks cell-cycle regulators for their subsequent destruction. Two null mutations of the cul-1 gene are known, in budding yeast and in nematodes. Although in both these organisms the cul-1 gene executes essentially the same function, the manifestation of its lack-of-function mutations differs considerably. In yeast the mutation causes arrest at the G(1)/S-phase transition, whereas in nematodes excessive cell divisions occur because mutant cells are unable to exit the mitotic cycle. We isolated cul-1 orthologues from two model organisms, Drosophila melanogaster and mouse. We show that the Drosophila full-length cul-1 gene restores the yeast mutant's inability to pass through the G(1)/S-phase transition. We also characterize expression of this gene at the transcript and protein levels during Drosophila development and show that cul-1 gene is maternally supplied as a protein, but not as an RNA transcript. Zygotic transcription of the gene, however, resumes at early stages of embryogenesis. We also found an increase in cul-1 transcription in cultured cells treated with a lethal dose of gamma-irradiation.",2000,"V Filippov, M Filippova, F Sehnal, S S Gill, V Filippov, M Filippova, F Sehnal, S S Gill"
A new family of adenylyl cyclase genes in the male germline of Drosophila melanogaster,11180822,10.1007/s004270050304,"We describe the cloning and characterization of a new gene family of adenylyl cyclase related genes in Drosophila. The five adenylyl cyclase-like genes that define this family are clearly distinct from previously known adenylyl cyclases. One member forms a unique locus on chromosome 3 whereas the other four members form a tightly clustered, tandemly repeated array on chromosome 2. The genes on chromosome 2 are transcribed in the male germline in a doublesex dependent manner and are expressed in postmitotic, meiotic, and early differentiating sperm. These genes therefore provide the first evidence for a role for the cAMP signaling pathway in Drosophila spermatogenesis. Expression from this locus is under the control of the always early, cannonball, meiosis arrest, and spermatocyte arrest genes that are required for the G2/M transition of meiosis I during spermatogenesis, implying a mechanism for the coordination of differentiation and proliferation. Evidence is also provided for positive selection at the locus on chromosome 2 which suggests this gene family is actively evolving and may play a novel role in spermatogenesis.",2000,"M J Cann, E Chung, L R Levin, M J Cann, E Chung, L R Levin"
A search for reverse transcriptase-coding sequences reveals new non-LTR retrotransposons in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster,11178266,10.1186/gb-2000-1-6-research0012,"Background:
      
    

    
      Non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons are eukaryotic mobile genetic elements that transpose by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. We have performed a systematic search for sequences matching the characteristic reverse transcriptase domain of non-LTR retrotransposons in the sequenced regions of the Drosophila melanogaster genome.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In addition to previously characterized BS, Doc, F, G, I and Jockey elements, we have identified new non-LTR retrotransposons: Waldo, You and JuanDm. Waldo elements are related to mosquito RTI elements. You to the Drosophila I factor, and JuanDm to mosquito Juan-A and Juan-C. Interestingly, all JuanDm elements are highly homogeneous in sequence, suggesting that they are recent components of the Drosophila genome.

      The genome of D. melanogaster contains at least ten families of non-site-specific non-LTR retrotransposons representing three distinct clades. Many of these families contain potentially active members.

Ectopic expression of the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor alters behavioral rhythms in Drosophila melanogaster,10777797,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.20-09-03339.2000,"To study the function of the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) in the circadian system of Drosophila, we misexpressed the pdf gene from the grasshopper Romalea in the CNS of Drosophila and investigated the effect of this on behavioral rhythmicity. pdf was either ectopically expressed in different numbers of neurons in the brain or the thoracical nervous system or overexpressed in the pacemaker neurons alone. We found severe alterations in the activity and eclosion rhythm of several but not all lines with ectopic pdf expression. Only ectopic pdf expression in neurons that projected into the dorsal central brain severely influenced activity rhythms. Therefore, we conclude that PDF acts as a neuromodulator in the dorsal central brain that is involved in the rhythmic control of behavior. Overexpression of pdf in the pacemaker neurons alone or in the other neurons that express the clock genes period (per) and timeless (tim) did not disturb the activity rhythm. Such flies still showed a rhythm in PDF accumulation in the central brain terminals. This rhythm was absent in the terminals of neurons that expressed PDF ectopically. Probably, PDF is rhythmically processed, transported, or secreted in neurons expressing per and tim, and additional PDF expression in these cells does not influence this rhythmic process. In neurons lacking per and tim, PDF appears to be continuously processed, leading to a constant PDF secretion at their nerve terminals. This may lead to conflicting signals in the rhythmic output pathway and result in a severely altered rhythmic behavior.",2000,"C Helfrich-FÃ¶rster, M TÃ¤uber, J H Park, M MÃ¼hlig-Versen, S Schneuwly, A Hofbauer, C Helfrich-FÃ¶rster, M TÃ¤uber, J H Park, M MÃ¼hlig-Versen, S Schneuwly, A Hofbauer"

Turnover time for calcium, calculated as the time for (45)Ca(2+)to accumulate to half the steady state value of 3.46 nmol/fly, was 3.3 days. Although larvae weighed 2x as much as adults, they contained 3-4x as much calcium. Anterior Malpighian tubules (Mts) contain much more calcium than posterior Mts, accounting for 25-30% of the calcium content of the whole fly. In response to a 6.2-fold increase in dietary calcium level, calcium content of whole flies increased only 10%. Hemolymph calcium concentration ( approximately 0.5 mM) was similar in males and females and in animals raised on diets differing in calcium content. Fluid secretion rate, secreted fluid calcium concentration, and transepithelial calcium flux in tubules isolated from flies raised on high and low calcium diets did not differ significantly. Malpighian tubules secrete calcium at rates sufficient to eliminate whole body calcium content in 0.5 and 3 days for tubules secreting fluid at basal and maximal rates, respectively. It is suggested that flies absorb high quantities of calcium from the diet and maintain homeostasis through the combined effects of elimination of calcium in fluid secreted by the Malpighian tubules and the sequestration of calcium in granules, especially within the distal segment of the anterior pair of Malpighian tubules.",2000,"K A Dube, D G McDonald, M J O'Donnell, K A Dube, D G McDonald, M J O'Donnell"
Genetics of alcohol-induced behaviors in Drosophila,11199289,,"Researchers frequently study the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model system for mammalian development and behavior. Drosophila appear resistant to alcohol's toxic effects and display many behaviors resembling intoxication (e.g., impaired motor control) when exposed to alcohol vapors. Accordingly, investigators have begun to measure alcohol sensitivity in Drosophila and to identify genetic mutations associated with increased or decreased sensitivity. One mutant called cheapdate affects a signaling system that plays a role in many regulatory processes in a cell and which involves the compound cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Additional Drosophila mutants with altered alcohol sensitivity carry mutations in other components of the cAMP signaling system. Because the cAMP system also is affected in human alcoholics, these results indicate that studies using Drosophila as a model system may identify genetic changes relevant to human alcoholism.",2000,"U Heberlein, U Heberlein"
A genetic test of the mechanism of Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility in Drosophila,10655228,,"Cytoplasmic bacteria of the genus Wolbachia are best known as the cause of cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI): many uninfected eggs fertilized by Wolbachia-modified sperm from infected males die as embryos. In contrast, eggs of infected females rescue modified sperm and develop normally. Although Wolbachia cause CI in at least five insect orders, the mechanism of CI remains poorly understood. Here I test whether the target of Wolbachia-induced sperm modification is the male pronucleus (e.g., DNA or pronuclear proteins) or some extranuclear factor from the sperm required for embryonic development (e.g., the paternal centrosome). I distinguish between these hypotheses by crossing gynogenetic Drosophila melanogaster females to infected males. Gynogenetic females produce diploid eggs whose normal development requires no male pronucleus but still depends on extranuclear paternal factors. I show that when gynogenetic females are crossed to infected males, uniparental progeny with maternally derived chromosomes result. This finding shows that Wolbachia impair the male pronucleus but no extranuclear component of the sperm.",2000,"D C Presgraves, D C Presgraves"
Evolution of DNA in heterochromatin: the Drosophila melanogaster sibling species subgroup as a resource,11293787,10.1023/a:1026588217432,"The Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup is a closely-knit collection of eight sibling species whose relationships are well defined. These species are too close for most evolutionary studies of euchromatic genes but are ideal to investigate the major changes that occur to DNA in heterochromatin over short periods during evolution. For example, it is not known whether the locations of genes in heterochromatin are conserved over this time. The 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA genes can be considered as genuine heterochromatic genes. In D. melanogaster the rRNA genes are located at two sites, one each on the X and Y chromosome. In the other seven sibling species, rRNA genes are also located on the sex chromosomes but the positions often vary significantly, particularly on the Y. Furthermore, rDNA has been lost from the Y chromosome of both D. simulans and D. sechellia, presumably after separation of the line leading to present-day D. mauritiana. We conclude that changes to chromosomal position and copy number of rDNA arrays occur over much shorter evolutionary timespans than previously thought. In these respects the rDNA behaves more like the tandemly repeated satellite DNAs than euchromatic genes.",2000,"A R Lohe, P A Roberts, A R Lohe, P A Roberts"
Reduced X-linked nucleotide polymorphism in Drosophila simulans,10823947,10.1073/pnas.97.11.5960,"Population genetic theory predicts that selectively driven changes of allele frequency for both beneficial and deleterious mutants reduce polymorphism at tightly linked sites. All else being equal, these reductions in polymorphism are expected to be greater when recombination rates are lower. Therefore, the empirical observation of a positive correlation between recombination rates and amounts of DNA polymorphism across the Drosophila melanogaster genome can be explained by two very different types of natural selection. Here, we evaluate alternative models of effects of selection on linked sites by comparison of X-linked and autosomal variation. We present polymorphism data from 40 genes distributed across chromosome arms X and 3R of Drosophila simulans, a sibling species of D. melanogaster. We find significantly less silent polymorphism in D. simulans on the X chromosome than on 3R, but no difference between arms for silent divergence between species. This pattern is incompatible with predictions from theoretical studies on the effect of negative selection on linked sites. We propose that some form of positive selection having greater effects on sex chromosomes than on autosomes is the better explanation for the D. simulans data.",2000,"D J Begun, P Whitley, D J Begun, P Whitley"

Function and structure of Drosophila glycans,10929001,10.1093/glycob/10.8.751,"Through the application of classic organismal genetic strategies, such as mutagenesis and interaction screens, Drosophila melanogaster provides opportunities to understand glycan function. For instance, screens for Drosophila genes that establish dorsal-ventral polarity in the embryo or that influence cellular differentiation through signal modulation have identified putative glycan modifying enzymes. Other genetic and molecular approaches have demonstrated the existence of phylogenetically conserved and novel oligosaccharide processing activities and carbohydrate binding proteins. While the structural characterization of Drosophila oligosaccharide diversity has lagged behind the elucidation of glycan function, landmarks are becoming apparent in the carbohydrate terrain. For instance, O-linked GlcNAc and mucins, spatially and temporally regulated N-linked oligosaccharide expression, glycosphingolipids, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate and polysialic acid have all been described. A major challenge for Drosophila glycobiology is to expand the oligosaccharide structural database while endeavoring to link glycan characterization to functional analysis. The completion of the Drosophila genome sequencing project will yield a broad portfolio of glycosyltransferases, glycan modifying enzymes and lectins requiring characterization.

Multiple mechanisms leading to partial enzyme expression in heterozygotes and a wide range of dominance varying from almost complete recessive to a high degree of dominance were found. An expression of partial dominance for alcohol tolerance was observed for all 12 Adhn under the high stress of 10% ethanol.

"Numb suppresses the negative complementation at the Notch locus of Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting a putative mechanism for negative complementation",11865711,10.1017/s0016672301005304,"The mutant form of the intracellular asymmetrically localized Numb membrane-bound protein of Drosophila melanogaster suppresses the negative complementation of certain Abruptex (Ax) mutations of the Notch (N) locus encoding a transmembrane receptor protein in which the Ax mutations are mutations in the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats of the extracellular domain of the receptor. One model for how Ax mutants affect N function is that they are refractory to an antagonistic signal generated by an excess of N ligands. Genetically numb (nb) is an antagonist of N. In the absence of nb, cells follow the same fate as they would in the presence of a gain-of-function N allele, such as Ax. Numb has been shown to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of Notch. It is therefore suggested that numb counteracts the effect of Abruptex on Notch ligand binding, i.e. that Numb is an antagonist to the activation of the Notch signal generated by Notch ligands. Numb might accomplish this by interfering with the proteolytic cleavage of the Notch intracellular domain at the cell membrane. Thus, it seems possible that the mechanism of negative complementation of certain Ax mutants is the failure of this cleavage. Other possible mechanisms for negative complementation are also discussed.",2001,"P Portin, P Portin"

First, expression of enhancer-trap marker BC69, which reflects vas expression, is promoted by maternal Nos and Pum. Second, expression of vas mRNA in pole cells is promoted by maternal Nos and Pum. Third, pole cell transplantation experiments reveal that maternal Nos and Pum are required autonomously in pole cells for proper expression of vas. Finally, Nos and Pum are dispensable for vas expression in oogenesis, although they are expressed zygotically in adult ovaries.

An investigation of the cause of low variability on the fourth chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster,11719575,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003772,"The fourth chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster lacks meiotic recombination. There is also a lack of nucleotide variation on the chromosome. This lack of variation could have been caused by a recent selective sweep, by background selection, or by a combination of these two forces. It should be possible to differentiate between the two mechanisms by studying the frequencies of polymorphic sites on the chromosome: a selective sweep should have resulted in low-frequency polymorphisms, whereas higher frequency polymorphisms would indicate the action of background selection. We have analyzed retrotransposable element insertions on the fourth chromosome in 11 strains of D. melanogaster. The polymorphisms found have a range of frequencies, with the presence of some insertions with high frequencies suggesting that the lack of variation is the result of background selection. We summarize the data using two statistics: the number of sites shared by more than one of the sample of 11 chromosomes (internal sites) and the mean number of transposable element differences in presence or absence between the sampled chromosomes. Simulations indicate that a selective sweep occurring more than 15,000 (0.03N) generations ago cannot be ruled out from the number of internal sites, although the number of differences between the chromosomes suggests either background selection or a sweep occurring more than 60,000 (0.12N) generations ago. Our results show no homoplasies and are thus consistent with no recombination occurring on the chromosome.

The first comes from a cDNA sequence of Dfos (Perkins et al., Genes Dev. 4 (1990) 822). The second is from the gene sequence published by the Drosophila genome project (Adams et al., Science 287 (2000) 2185), and there are notable contradictions between the two models. The promoter and the 5' end of the transcript sequence were not identified in either model. In this paper, we present the gene structure of Dfos and identify the promoter. This promoter has an initiator and a downstream promoter element sequence, but lacks a TATA box. Through comparison of the mRNA and genomic DNA sequences, three introns varying in length from 66 bp to 17.57 kb were found and verified by RT-PCR. The Dfos gene is 21.2 kb in length, giving a transcript of 3438 bp, coding for a predicted protein of 595 amino acids. The 3' untranslated region is confirmed to be 1092 bp in length.",2001,"E Rousseau, E S Goldstein, E Rousseau, E S Goldstein"
Drosophila males transfer antibacterial proteins from their accessory gland and ejaculatory duct to their mates,11249950,10.1016/s0022-1910(00)00151-7,"The male fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, transfers to his mate proteins that increase his reproductive success by causing changes in her behavior and physiology. Here we show that among the transferred proteins are ones with antibacterial activity. We performed Escherichia coli overlay assays of native PAGE or renatured SDS-PAGE of reproductive tissue extracts of wild-type or transgenic males deficient in accessory gland function. We detected a 28 kDa male accessory gland-derived protein and two ejaculatory duct-derived proteins all with antibacterial activity. Based on its gel mobility and tissue of synthesis, one of the ejaculatory duct proteins is likely to be andropin, a previously-reported 6 kDa antibacterial peptide. All three proteins are transferred to females during mating. Therefore, they could assist in protecting the male's reproductive tract and, after transfer to the female, the female's reproductive tract or eggs against bacterial infection. Since seminal fluid proteins are transferred before the sperm, these antibacterial proteins may also protect sperm from bacterial infection.",2001,"O Lung, L Kuo, M F. Wolfner, O Lung, L Kuo, M F.

Effect of ionic concentration on the higher-order structure of prophenol oxidase in Drosophila melanogaster,11521509,10.1023/a:1010233307490,"Phenol oxidase in Drosophila melanogaster occurs as precursors designated prophenol oxidases A1 and A3. Crossing experiments between isozyme variants proved that prophenol oxidase in this species is a homodimer. Prophenol oxidases were partially purified using ammonium sulfate fractionation, phenyl Sepharose, and DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. The preparations were mixed, then dialyzed against buffer containing varying salt concentrations. The resulting prophenol oxidase was analyzed by gel electrophoresis. At 20 mM KCl or NaCl, two bands of phenol oxidase were observed, corresponding to the parental ones as monomer, whereas at 200 mM KCl or NaCl, three bands appeared in the gel, one being a dimer. The monomer-dimer reversibility of the Drosophila prophenol oxidase depends on the salt concentrations. The phenol oxidase activity remained unaffected within the KCl concentrations tested. Considering the ionic concentration of Drosophila hemolymph, these results indicate that prophenol oxidase exists as a dimer in vivo, and the higher-order structure of prophenol oxidase can be altered reversibly by ionic concentrations in vitro.",2001,"H Sezaki, N Kawamoto, N Asada, H Sezaki, N Kawamoto, N Asada"
Control of Drosophila paramyosin/miniparamyosin gene expression. Differential regulatory mechanisms for muscle-specific transcription,11110792,10.1074/jbc.M009302200,"To define the transcriptional mechanisms contributing to stage- and tissue-specific expression of muscle genes, we performed transgenic analysis of Drosophila paramyosin gene regulation. This gene has two promoters, one for paramyosin and one for miniparamyosin, which are active in partially overlapping domains. Regions between -0.9 and -1.7 kilobases upstream of each initiation site contribute to the temporal and spatial expression patterns. By comparing the Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis promoters, conserved binding sites were found for known myogenic factors, including one MEF2 site and three E boxes. In contrast with previous data, our experiments with the paramyosin promoter indicate that the MEF2 site is essential but not sufficient for proper paramyosin gene transcription. Mutations in the three E boxes, on the other hand, do not produce any effect in embryonic/larval muscles. Thus MEF2 site- and E box-binding proteins can play different roles in the regulation of different muscle-specific genes. For the miniparamyosin promoters, several conserved sequences were shown to correspond to functionally important regions. Our data further show that the two promoters work independently. Even when both promoters are active in the same muscle fiber, the transcription driven by one of the promoters is not affected by transcription driven by the other.",2001,"J J Arredondo, R M Ferreres, M Maroto, R M Cripps, R Marco, S I Bernstein, M Cervera, J J Arredondo, R M Ferreres, M Maroto, R M Cripps, R Marco, S I Bernstein, M Cervera"
Comparative analysis of the Band 4.1/ezrin-related protein tyrosine phosphatase Pez from two Drosophila species: implications for structure and function,11587846,10.1016/s0378-1119(01)00686-2,"The FERM-PTPs are a group of proteins that have FERM (Band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin homology) domains at or near their N-termini, and PTP (protein tyrosine phosphatase) domains at their C-termini. Their central regions contain either PSD-95, Dlg, ZO-1 homology domains or putative Src homology 3 domain binding sites. The known FERM-PTPs fall into three distinct classes, which we name BAS, MEG, and PEZ, after representative human PTPs. Here we analyze Pez, a novel gene encoding the single PEZ-class protein present in Drosophila. Pez cDNAs were sequenced from the distantly related flies Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila silvestris, and found to be highly conserved except in the central region, which contains at least 21 insertions and deletions. Comparison of fly and human Pez reveals several short conserved motifs in the central region that are likely protein binding sites and/or phosphorylation sites. We also identified novel invertebrate members of the BAS and MEG classes using genome data, and generated an alignment of vertebrate and invertebrate FERM domains of each class. 'Specialized' residues were identified that are conserved only within a given class of PTPs. These residues highlight surface regions that may bind class-specific ligands; for PEZ, these residues cluster on and near FERM subdomain F1. Finally, the PTP domain of fly Pez was modeled based on known PTP tertiary structures, and we conclude that Pez is likely a functional phosphatase despite some unusual features of the active site cleft sequences. Biochemical confirmation of this hypothesis and genetic analysis of Pez are currently underway.",2001,"K Edwards, T Davis, D Marcey, J Kurihara, D Yamamoto, K Edwards, T Davis, D Marcey, J Kurihara, D Yamamoto"
Application of a time-delay neural network to promoter annotation in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,11765852,10.1016/s0097-8485(01)00099-7,"Computational methods for automated genome annotation are critical to understanding and interpreting the bewildering mass of genomic sequence data presently being generated and released. A neural network model of the structural and compositional properties of a eukaryotic core promoter region has been developed and its application for analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster genome is presented. The model uses a time-delay architecture, a special case of a feed-forward neural network. The structure of this model allows for variable spacing between functional binding sites, which is known to play a key role in the transcription initiation process. Application of this model to a test set of core promoters not only gave better discrimination of potential promoter sites than previous statistical or neural network models, but also revealed indirectly subtle properties of the transcription initiation signal. When tested in the Adh region of 2.9 Mbases of the Drosophila genome, the neural network for promoter prediction (NNPP) program that incorporates the time-delay neural network model gives a recognition rate of 75% (69/92) with a false positive rate of 1/547 bases. The present work can be regarded as one of the first intensive studies that applies novel gene regulation technologies to the identification of the complex gene regulation sites in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster.",2001,"M G Reese, M G Reese"
Switch in 3' splice site recognition between exon definition and splicing catalysis is important for sex-lethal autoregulation,11238934,10.1128/MCB.21.6.1986-1996.2001,"Maintenance of female sexual identity in Drosophila melanogaster involves an autoregulatory loop in which the protein Sex-lethal (SXL) promotes skipping of exon 3 from its own pre-mRNA. We have used transient transfection of Drosophila Schneider cells to analyze the role of exon 3 splice sites in regulation. Our results indicate that exon 3 repression requires competition between the 5' splice sites of exons 2 and 3 but is independent of their relative strength. Two 3' splice site AG's precede exon 3. We report here that, while the distal site plays a critical role in defining the exon, the proximal site is preferentially used for the actual splicing reaction, arguing for a switch in 3' splice site recognition between exon definition and splicing catalysis. Remarkably, the presence of the two 3' splice sites is important for the efficient regulation by SXL, suggesting that SXL interferes with molecular events occurring between initial splice site communication across the exon and the splice site pairing that leads to intron removal.",2001,"L O Penalva, M J Lallena, J ValcÃ¡rcel, L O Penalva, M J Lallena, J ValcÃ¡rcel"
A cost of reproduction in Drosophila melanogaster: stress susceptibility,11580019,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2001.tb00679.x,"Little is known about physiological mechanisms that underlie the cost of reproduction. We tested the hypothesis that stress susceptibility is a cost of reproduction. In one test of our hypothesis, Drosophila melanogaster females were exposed to a juvenile hormone analog (methoprene) to stimulate egg production followed by stress assays. A sterile stock of D. melanogaster was employed as a control for reproduction. Exposure of fertile females to methoprene resulted in an increase in female reproduction and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress and starvation (compared to solvent controls). Sterile females did not exhibit a decrease in stress resistance. Mating also stimulated egg production. As a second test of our hypothesis, mated females were compared to virgin females. Mated fertile females were relatively susceptible to oxidative stress, but this relationship was not evident when mated and virgin sterile females were compared.

Water acquisition and partitioning in Drosophila melanogaster: effects of selection for desiccation-resistance,11606606,,"We examined physiological features related to water balance in five replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster that have undergone selection for enhanced resistance to desiccation (D populations) and in five replicate control (C) populations. Adult D flies contain 34 % more water than the control flies. We examined two hypotheses for increased water acquisition in the D flies: (i) that they accumulate more water early in development and (ii) that they have a reduced post-eclosion diuretic water loss. We found no evidence of differential water or dry mass acquisition between the C and D populations prior to adulthood. We also found no evidence of differential post-eclosion diuresis, i.e. both C and D groups showed insignificant changes in water volume in the 4 h period immediately after eclosion. In addition, we quantified water content in the intra- and extracellular compartments of the C and D populations and were able to identify the hemolymph as the primary storage site of the 'extra' water carried by the desiccation-resistant flies. We estimated that 68 % of the increased water volume observed in the D flies was contained in the hemolymph. Desiccation-resistance was strongly correlated with hemolymph volume and only weakly with intracellular water volume. Survival during desiccation was also strongly related to the carbohydrate content of the D flies. It has been presumed that the D flies accumulate carbohydrate primarily as intracellular glycogen, which would result in a significant increase in intracellular water volume. We found that carbohydrate content was weakly correlated with intracellular water volume and more strongly with hemolymph volume. The carbohydrate pool in the D flies may, therefore, be contained in the extracellular compartment as well as in cells. These results are suggestive of the importance of modifications in hemolymph volume and hemolymph solute concentrations in the evolution of enhanced desiccation-tolerance in populations of Drosophila melanogaster.",2001,"D G Folk, C Han, T J Bradley, D G Folk, C Han, T J Bradley"

J Biol Chem 275: 24552--24559, 2000). In the present study we used immunohistochemical and Western blot techniques to characterize the developmental expression, subcellular localization, and tissue distribution of NDAE1 protein in D. melanogaster. We have shown that a polyclonal antibody raised against the NH(2) terminus of NDAE1 (alpha CWR57) recognizes NDAE1 electrophysiologically characterized in Xenopus oocytes. Moreover, our results begin to delineate the NDAE1 topology, i.e., both the NH(2) and COOH termini are intracellular. NDAE1 is expressed throughout Drosophila development in the central and peripheral nervous systems, sensilla, and the alimentary tract (Malpighian tubules, gut, and salivary glands). Coimmunolabeling of larval tissues with NDAE1 antibody and a monoclonal antibody to the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase alpha-subunit revealed that the majority of NDAE1 is located at the basolateral membranes of Malpighian tubule cells. These results suggest that NDAE1 may be a key pH(i) regulatory protein and may contribute to basolateral ion transport in epithelia and nervous system of Drosophila.",2001,"C M Sciortino, L D Shrode, B R Fletcher, P J Harte, M F Romero, C M Sciortino, L D Shrode, B R Fletcher, P J Harte, M F Romero"

Larval crowding led to both increased mean and maximal longevity in adults of both sexes. Two different measures of heat-stress resistance increased in adult flies developed at high density compared to flies developed at low density. The hardening-like effect of high larval density carried over to the adult life stage. The hardening memory (the period of increased resistance after hardening) was long compared to hardening of adult flies, and possibly lasts throughout life. The increase in resistance in adults following development at high larval density seemed not to be connected to Hsp70 itself, since Hsp70 expression level in adult flies after hardening was independent of whether larvae developed at low or high densities. More likely, Hsp70 may be one of many components of the stress response resulting in hardening.",2001,"J G. SÃ¸rensen, V Loeschcke, J G. SÃ¸rensen, V Loeschcke"

The CYP6 family is insect specific whereas the CYP4 family includes sequences from vertebrates. There are eight genes coding for mitochondrial P450s as deduced from their homology to CYP12A1 from the house fly. The genetic map of the distribution of D. melanogaster P450 genes shows (a) the absence of P450 genes on the chromosome 4 and Y, (b) more than half of the P450 genes are found on chromosome 2, and (c) the largest cluster contains nine genes.

We found 57 unique intron positions, of which 23 were phase zero, 19 were phase one and 15 were phase two. There was a relatively good correlation between intron conservation and phylogenetic relationship between members of the P450 subfamilies. Although the function of many P450 proteins from vertebrates, fungi, plants and bacteria is known, only a single P450 from D. melanogaster, CYP6A2, has been functionally characterized.

Modulation of the cardiac pacemaker of Drosophila: cellular mechanisms,11919704,10.1007/s00360-001-0246-8,"The myogenic cardiac pacemaker of Drosophila melanogaster responds to a range of neurotransmitters and hormones by adjusting heart rate. These cardioactive substances ultimately affect the activity of ion channels comprising the pacemaker. We report here work utilizing genetic variants and pharmacological tools to explore a subset of possible mechanisms for this cellular signaling, specifically: receptors, cAMP, cGMP, G proteins, and calcium. We found that alpha(1) adrenergic and 5-hydroxytryptamine(2) (5-HT(2)) receptors are critical components of mediating modulation of heart rate. There was no evidence that the cAMP system is part of the modulatory mechanism. cGMP is likely to be integral to one active pathway, as non-hydrolyzable forms of this cyclic nucleotide increase heart rate, and flies bearing the mutation sitter, a recessive allele of the foraging gene, which encodes a cGMP-dependent kinase, have tachycardia. Heart rhythm is affected by pertussis toxin and by agonists and antagonists of both alpha(1) adrenergic and 5-HT(2) receptors; this suggests involvement of two different types of G proteins. The l(4)16/ciD line, containing a mutation in CaM kinase II, eliminates pacemaker responsiveness to serotonin but is without effect on norepinephrine sensitivity. This result is the same as that for the CaM kinase II enzyme inhibitor KN-93. This work establishes a framework for further investigations into the control of the cardiac pacemaker, and expands the applicability of the Drosophila heart model.",2002,"E Johnson, T Sherry, J Ringo, H Dowse, E Johnson, T Sherry, J Ringo, H Dowse"

There is clear evidence that some genes can act as a reservoir of species-specific behaviour, particularly for the male actions during courtship. However, to date there has not been a single genetic locus that has been isolated at the molecular level and shown to be associated with a change in female preference. There are some promising avenues of exploration, in that recent genetic analyses suggest that a small number of genes may make major contributions to female preferences.

Here we describe the cloning of a Drosophila E2 gene, UbcD4, which is only expressed in embryos. Its expression pattern in stage 10-11 embryos suggests a role in germ cell development.

Water balance in desert Drosophila: lessons from non-charismatic microfauna,12443934,10.1016/s1095-6433(02)00208-8,"Water stress is a particularly important problem for insects and other small organisms in arid environments. Cactophilic fruit flies in the genus Drosophila have invaded deserts on numerous occasions, including multiple independent invasions of North American deserts. Because the evolutionary history of this genus is so well studied, we can investigate the mechanisms of adaptation in a rigorous phylogenetic context. As expected, desert fruit flies lose water less rapidly than their mesic congeners. They are also able to tolerate the loss of a greater percentage of body water, but this difference is mainly due to phylogenetic history, and does not represent an adaptation specifically to desert habitats. A laboratory analogue of desert Drosophila is provided by populations of D. melanogaster that have been subjected to selection for desiccation resistance. Selected populations resemble desert species in that they lose water slowly, relative to control populations, and are not more tolerant of dehydration stress. They differ, however, in having much higher water contents and different behavioral responses to desiccating conditions. Our comparisons of laboratory and natural populations reveal that not all possible adaptive mechanisms evolve in stressful environments. Different physiological and behavioral strategies may evolve depending upon the particular options available in the environment.",2002,"Allen G Gibbs, Allen G Gibbs"
Hidden evolution: progress and limitations in detecting multifarious natural selection,12206367,10.1023/a:1016288725718,"From illustrative examples of research on the best-studied group of species to date, Drosophila melanogaster and its closest relatives, we argue that selection is multifarious, but often hidden. Selective fixation of new, highly advantageous alleles is the most parsimonious explanation for a typical pattern of molecular variation observed in genomic regions characterized by very low recombination: drastically reduced DNA sequence variation within species and typical levels of sequence divergence among species. At the same time, the identity of the gene (or genes) influenced by selection is not just difficult to discern; it may be impossible. Studies of the genetic basis of reproductive isolation demonstrate that, although the D. melanogaster complex species appear virtually identical, dozens of currently unidentified genes contribute to hybrid sterility. We argue that these findings are best explained by selectively-driven functional divergence and demonstrate the multifarious nature of selection. Although multifarious selection certainly occurs, the exact characters responsible for differences in survival and reproductive success are unknown. We do not see these inherent limits as a cause for despair or a problem for evolutionary biology. Instead, we hope to raise awareness of these complexities of evolution by highlighting both the progress and the limitations of characterizing multifarious natural selection.",2002,"Norman A Johnson, Richard M Kliman, Norman A Johnson, Richard M Kliman"

Transvection and silencing of the Scr homeotic gene of Drosophila melanogaster,12072469,,"The Sex combs reduced (Scr) gene specifies the identities of the labial and first thoracic segments in Drosophila melanogaster. In imaginal cells, some Scr mutations allow cis-regulatory elements on one chromosome to stimulate expression of the promoter on the homolog, a phenomenon that was named transvection by Ed Lewis in 1954. Transvection at the Scr gene is blocked by rearrangements that disrupt pairing, but is zeste independent. Silencing of the Scr gene in the second and third thoracic segments, which requires the Polycomb group proteins, is disrupted by most chromosomal aberrations within the Scr gene. Some chromosomal aberrations completely derepress Scr even in the presence of normal levels of all Polycomb group proteins. On the basis of the pattern of chromosomal aberrations that disrupt Scr gene silencing, we propose a model in which two cis-regulatory elements interact to stabilize silencing of any promoter or cis-regulatory element physically between them. This model also explains the anomalous behavior of the Scx allele of the flanking homeotic gene, Antennapedia. This allele, which is associated with an insertion near the Antennapedia P1 promoter, inactivates the Antennapedia P1 and P2 promoters in cis and derepresses the Scr promoters both in cis and on the homologous chromosome.",2002,"Jeffrey W Southworth, James A Kennison, Jeffrey W Southworth, James A Kennison"

"Comparative modeling of the phosphatase and kinase domains of protein tyrosine phosphatase and insulin receptor kinase from Drosophila melanogaster (DPTP61fm), and a computational study of their mutual interactions",11989718,10.1139/o02-001,"The components and functions of the insulin receptor kinase signaling pathway have been conserved in a broad range of Metazoa ranging from mammals to insects and nematodes. There is a high degree of sequence homology and functional similarity between the human insulin receptor kinase (IRK) and the drosophila (Drosophila melanogaster) form (DIRK) of this enzyme. Similarly, a high degree of homology exists between human protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) (which directly regulates IRK) and its drosophila counterpart DPTP61F (DPTP). However, genetic and biochemical studies have yet to demonstrate that DPTP61F acts in the DIRK pathway. Comparative structural modeling techniques using the known structures of human IRK and PTP1B as templates have yielded structures for the drosophila enzymes. The derived structures confirm that there is a high level of structural conservation at the tertiary level. Association of the DIRK and DPTP enzymes with each other was then investigated with a view to ascertaining whether DIRK might be a substrate of the DPTP. Evaluation of the interaction surfaces, including hydrophobic patch, shape, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic compatibility, strongly suggested that the drosophila insulin receptor is a substrate of the DPTP. The interaction surfaces of the human and drosophila enzymes are structurally similar, although changes in critical residues modify possible electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. This suggests that in the mixed systems, DPTP-IRK or PTP1B-DIRK, the kinase domain will be a comparatively poor substrate for phosphatase activity when compared with the native systems.",2002,"Sanchita Hati, Sudeep Bhattacharyya, James V Price, Alan S Tracey, Sanchita Hati, Sudeep Bhattacharyya, James V Price, Alan S Tracey"
Nucleotide variation at the no-on-transient A gene in Drosophila littoralis,11813105,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800006,"The no-on-transient A (nonA) gene encodes a putative RNA-binding protein, and mutations in this gene are known to affect vision, male courtship song and viability in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we have sequenced the coding region of the nonA gene of Drosophila littoralis and compared it with those of Drosophila virilis and D. melanogaster. All portions of nonA appeared to be conserved between D. littoralis and D. virilis, while the 5' region of the gene of these two species showed high divergence from that of a more distantly-related species, D. melanogaster. The same was true for the glycine repeat regions. No significant deviation from neutrality was observed in the analysis of intraspecific nucleotide variation in 5' or 3' region of the nonA gene in D. littoralis population. Also, comparison of D. littoralis sequences with homologous sequence of D. virilis suggests that the gene is evolving neutrally in D. virilis group. Divergence of the 5' regions between D. virilis group species and D. melanogaster could be a result of positive selection, but this finding is obscured by the long divergence time of the species groups.",2002,"S Huttunen, S Campesan, A Hoikkala"
Longevity determination genes in Drosophila melanogaster,12470891,10.1016/s0047-6374(02)00089-1,"Identification of longevity mutants is crucial for genetic approach to dissect the molecular mechanism of aging and longevity determination.

Extended longevity phenotypes were also observed in transgenic flies overexpressing antioxidant enzymes, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and Catalase, Cu/Zn SOD only, or a molecular chaperone, hsp70. Pleiotropism of mutations is a limitation associated with conventional mutagenesis for efficient detection of longevity determination genes. Using a conditional misexpression system, we identified Drosophila POSH (DPOSH), a scaffold protein containing RING finger and four SH3 domains, whose ubiquitous overexpression in adult stage extends the longevity.

"Chk2 regulates irradiation-induced, p53-mediated apoptosis in Drosophila",12172011,10.1073/pnas.172382899,"The tumor suppressor function of p53 has been attributed to its ability to regulate apoptosis and the cell cycle. In mammals, DNA damage, aberrant growth signals, chemotherapeutic agents, and UV irradiation activate p53, a process that is regulated by several posttranslational modifications. In Drosophila melanogaster, however, the regulation modes of p53 are still unknown. Overexpression of D. melanogaster p53 (Dmp53) in the eye induced apoptosis, resulting in a small eye phenotype. This phenotype was markedly enhanced by coexpression with D. melanogaster Chk2 (DmChk2) and was almost fully rescued by coexpression with a dominant-negative (DN), kinase-dead form of DmChk2. DN DmChk2 also inhibited Dmp53-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA damage, whereas overexpression of Grapes (Grp), the Drosophila Chk1-homolog, and its DN mutant had no effect on Dmp53-induced phenotypes. DmChk2 also activated the Dmp53 transactivation activity in cultured cells. Mutagenesis of Dmp53 amino terminal Ser residues revealed that Ser-4 is critical for its responsiveness toward DmChk2. DmChk2 activates the apoptotic activity of Dmp53 and Ser-4 is required for this effect. Contrary to results in mammals, Grapes, the Drosophila Chk1-homolog, is not involved in regulating Dmp53.

Dendritic remodeling and growth of motoneurons during metamorphosis of Drosophila melanogaster,12077188,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.22-12-04906.2002,"Insect motoneurons display dramatic dendritic plasticity during metamorphosis. Many larval motoneurons survive to adulthood but undergo dendritic regression and outgrowth as they are incorporated into developing circuits. This study explores the dendritic remodeling and development of Drosophila motoneurons MN1-MN5, which innervate indirect flight muscles of the adult. MN1-MN5 are persistent larval neurons exhibiting two distinct metamorphic histories. MN1-MN4 are born in the embryo, innervate larval muscles, and undergo dendritic regression and regrowth during metamorphosis. MN5, which was identified through a combination of intracellular dye injection and retrograde staining at all stages, is also born embryonically but remains developmentally arrested until the onset of metamorphosis. In the larva, MN5 lacks dendrites, and its axon stops in the mesothoracic nerve without innervating a target muscle. It is dye coupled to the peripherally synapsing interneuron, which will become part of the giant fiber escape circuit of the adult fly. During pupal development, MN5 undergoes de novo dendritic growth and extension of its axon to innervate the developing target muscle. Its unique developmental history and identifiability make MN5 well suited for the study of dendritic growth using genetic and neurophysiological approaches.",2002,"Christos Consoulas, Linda L Restifo, Richard B Levine, Christos Consoulas, Linda L Restifo, Richard B Levine"
Penelope retroelements from Drosophila virilis are active after transformation of Drosophila melanogaster,12451171,10.1073/pnas.252641799,"The Penelope family of retroelements was first described in species of the Drosophila virilis group. Intact elements encode a reverse transcriptase and an endonuclease of the UvrC type, which may play a role in Penelope integration. Penelope is a key element in the induction of D. virilis hybrid dysgenesis, which involves the mobilization of several unrelated families of transposable elements. We here report the successful introduction of Penelope into the germ line of Drosophila melanogaster by P element-mediated transformation with three different constructs. Penelope is actively transcribed in the D. melanogaster genome only in lines transformed with a construct containing a full-length Penelope clone. The transcript is identical to that detected in D. virilis dysgenic hybrids. Most newly transposed Penelope elements have a very complex organization. Significant proliferation of Penelope copy number occurred in some lines during the 24-month period after transformation. The absence of copy number increase with two other constructs suggests that the 5' andor 3' UTRs of Penelope are required for successful transposition in D. melanogaster. No insect retroelement has previously been reported to be actively transcribed and to increase in copy number after interspecific transformation.",2002,"Konstantin I Pyatkov, Natalia G Shostak, Elena S Zelentsova, George T Lyozin, Michael I Melekhin, David J Finnegan, Margaret G Kidwell, Michael B Evgen'ev"
"Musca domestica, a window on the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms in insects",11902690,,"The genetic cascades regulating sex determination of the housefly, Musca domestica, and the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, appear strikingly different. The bifunctional switch gene doublesex, however, is present at the bottom of the regulatory cascades of both species, and so is transformer-2, one of the genetic elements required for the sex-specific regulation of doublesex. The upstream regulators are different: Drosophila utilizes Sex-lethal to coordinate the control of sex determination and dosage compensation, i.e., the process that equilibrates the difference of two X chromosomes in females versus one X chromosome in males. In the housefly, Sex-lethal is not involved in sex determination, and dosage compensation, if existent at all, is not coupled with sexual differentiation. This allows for more adaptive plasticity in the housefly system. Accordingly, natural housefly populations can vary greatly in their mechanism of sex determination, and new types can be generated in the laboratory.",2002,"Andreas DÃ¼bendorfer, Monika Hediger, GÃ©za Burghardt, Daniel Bopp, Andreas DÃ¼bendorfer, Monika Hediger, GÃ©za Burghardt, Daniel Bopp"

Drosophila Morgue is an F box/ubiquitin conjugase domain protein important for grim-reaper mediated apoptosis,12021772,10.1038/ncb800,"In Drosophila melanogaster, apoptosis is controlled by the integrated actions of the Grim-Reaper (Grim-Rpr) and Drosophila Inhibitor of Apoptosis (DIAP) proteins (reviewed in refs 1 4). The anti-apoptotic DIAPs bind to caspases and inhibit their proteolytic activities. DIAPs also bind to Grim-Rpr proteins, an interaction that promotes caspase activity and the initiation of apoptosis. Using a genetic modifier screen, we identified four enhancers of grim-reaper-induced apoptosis that all regulate ubiquitination processes: uba-1, skpA, fat facets (faf), and morgue. Strikingly, morgue encodes a unique protein that contains both an F box and a ubiquitin E2 conjugase domain that lacks the active site Cys required for ubiquitin linkage. A reduction of morgue activity suppressed grim-reaper-induced cell death in Drosophila. In cultured cells, Morgue induced apoptosis that was suppressed by DIAP1. Targeted morgue expression downregulated DIAP1 levels in Drosophila tissue, and Morgue and Rpr together downregulated DIAP1 levels in cultured cells. Consistent with potential substrate binding functions in an SCF ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, Morgue exhibited F box-dependent association with SkpA and F box-independent association with DIAP1. Morgue may thus have a key function in apoptosis by targeting DIAP1 for ubiquitination and turnover.",2002,"John P Wing, Barbara A Schreader, Takakazu Yokokura, Yiqin Wang, Paul S Andrews, Neda Huseinovic, Carolyn K Dong, Justyne L Ogdahl, Lawrence M Schwartz, Kristin White, John R Nambu, John P Wing, Barbara A Schreader, Takakazu Yokokura, Yiqin Wang, Paul S Andrews, Neda Huseinovic, Carolyn K Dong, Justyne L Ogdahl, Lawrence M Schwartz, Kristin White, John R Nambu"
DNA loss and evolution of genome size in Drosophila,12188050,10.1023/a:1016076215168,"Mutation is often said to be random. Although it must be true that mutation is ignorant about the adaptive needs of the organism and thus is random relative to them as a rule, mutation is not truly random in other respects. Nucleotide substitutions, deletions, insertions, inversions, duplications and other types of mutation occur at different rates and are effected by different mechanisms. Moreover the rates of different mutations vary from organism to organism. Differences in mutational biases, along with natural selection, could impact gene and genome evolution in important ways. For instance, several recent studies have suggested that differences in insertion/deletion biases lead to profound differences in the rate of DNA loss in animals and that this difference per se can lead to significant changes in genome size. In particular, Drosophila melanogaster appears to have a very high rate of deletions and the correspondingly high rate of DNA loss and a very compact genome. To assess the validity of these studies we must first assess the validity of the measurements of indel biases themselves. Here I demonstrate the robustness of indel bias measurements in Drosophila, by comparing indel patterns in different types of nonfunctional sequences. The indel pattern and the high rate of DNA loss appears to be shared by all known nonfunctional sequences, both euchromatic and heterochromatic, transposable and non-transposable, repetitive and unique. Unfortunately all available nonfunctional sequences are untranscribed and thus effects of transcription on indel bias cannot be assessed. I also discuss in detail why it is unlikely that natural selection for or against DNA loss significantly affects current estimates of indel biases.",2002,"Dmitri A Petrov, Dmitri A Petrov"
The evolution of single-copy Drosophila nuclear 4f-rnp genes: spliceosomal intron losses create polymorphic alleles,12355261,10.1007/s00239-002-2336-y,"This study provides the first report in which spliceosomal intron losses within a single-copy gene create functional polymorphic alleles in a population. 4f-rnp has previously been shown to be a nuclear gene that is localized on the X chromosome in D. melanogaster and to have eight short spliceosomal introns. An insect species survey was done via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of a 1028-bp gene fragment spanning introns 4-8, which are located in the 3' half of the gene. The results show that 4f-rnp and (thus far) introns 7 and 8 are at least as old as order Odonata (dragonflies), an early-diverging insect line. Unexpectedly, several species within the dipteran family Drosophilidae were found to contain two differently sized 4f-rnp gene sequence variants, owing to precise in-frame intron losses. Results of single-male D. melanogaster PCR analyses show that the two gene size variants are allelic and that the intron loss mechanism appears to be biased toward the 3' end of the gene. A stable potential stem-loop has been identified in D. melanogaster, predicted to fold the 4f-rnp mRNA 3' terminus into a natural primer for subsequent reverse transcription into cDNA. When results are displayed in a phylogenetic context, multiple independent intron loss events are identified. These observations support a model in which frequently occurring cDNAs have led to numerous independent intron losses via homologous recombination/gene conversion during 4f-rnp gene evolution. The results provide insights into the evolution of intron loss and may lead to improved understanding of the dynamics of this process in natural populations.",2002,"Amy L Feiber, Janaki Rangarajan, Jack C Vaughn, Amy L Feiber, Janaki Rangarajan, Jack C Vaughn"

Testing the neutral theory of molecular evolution with genomic data from Drosophila,11875569,10.1038/4151024a,"Although positive selection has been detected in many genes, its overall contribution to protein evolution is debatable. If the bulk of molecular evolution is neutral, then the ratio of amino-acid (A) to synonymous (S) polymorphism should, on average, equal that of divergence. A comparison of the A/S ratio of polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster with that of divergence from Drosophila simulans shows that the A/S ratio of divergence is twice as high---a difference that is often attributed to positive selection. But an increase in selective constraint owing to an increase in effective population size could also explain this observation, and, if so, all genes should be affected similarly. Here we show that the difference between polymorphism and divergence is limited to only a fraction of the genes, which are also evolving more rapidly, and this implies that positive selection is responsible. A higher A/S ratio of divergence than of polymorphism is also observed in other species, which suggests a rate of adaptive evolution that is far higher than permitted by the neutral theory of molecular evolution.",2002,"Justin C Fay, Gerald J Wyckoff, Chung-I Wu, Justin C Fay, Gerald J Wyckoff, Chung-I Wu"

In contrast, genes inserted in autosomal heterochromatin generally did not show imprint-regulated expression. The imprints were established on Y-linked transgenes inserted into many different sequences and locations.

Synaptic organization of the mushroom body calyx in Drosophila melanogaster,11920702,10.1002/cne.10155,"The calyx neuropil of the mushroom body in adult Drosophila melanogaster contains three major neuronal elements: extrinsic projection neurons, presumed cholinergic, immunoreactive to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT-ir) and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT-ir) antisera; presumed gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic extrinsic neurons with GABA-like immunoreactivity; and local intrinsic Kenyon cells. The projection neurons connecting the calyx with the antennal lobe via the antennocerebral tract are the only source of cholinergic elements in the calyces. Their terminals establish an array of large boutons 2-7 microm in diameter throughout all calycal subdivisions. The GABA-ir extrinsic neurons, different in origin, form a network of fine fibers and boutons codistributed in all calycal regions with the cholinergic terminals and with tiny profiles, mainly Kenyon cell dendrites. We have investigated the synaptic circuits of these three neuron types using preembedding immuno-electron microscopy. All ChAT/VAChT-ir boutons form divergent synapses upon multitudinous surrounding Kenyon cell dendrites. GABA-ir elements also regularly contribute divergent synaptic input onto these dendrites, as well as occasional inputs to boutons of projection neurons. The same synaptic microcircuits involving these three neuron types are repeatedly established in glomeruli in all calycal regions. Each glomerulus comprises a large cholinergic bouton at its core, encircled by tiny vesicle-free Kenyon cell dendrites as well as by a number of GABAergic terminals. A single dendritic profile may thereby receive synaptic input from both cholinergic and GABAergic elements in close vicinity at presynaptic sites with T-bars typical of fly synapses. ChAT-ir boutons regularly have large extensions of the active zones. Thus, Kenyon cells may receive major excitatory input from cholinergic boutons and considerable postsynaptic inhibition from GABAergic terminals, as well as, more rarely, presynaptic inhibitory signaling. The calycal glomeruli of Drosophila are compared with the cerebellar glomeruli of vertebrates. The cholinergic boutons are the largest identified cholinergic synapses in the Drosophila brain and an eligible prospect for studying the genetic regulation of excitatory presynaptic function.",2002,"Kouji Yasuyama, Ian A Meinertzhagen, Friedrich-Wilhelm SchÃ¼rmann, Kouji Yasuyama, Ian A Meinertzhagen, Friedrich-Wilhelm SchÃ¼rmann"

Additionally, the full spectrum of functional declines associated with aging has not been systematically evaluated in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, one of the leading models for aging research. Toward a more comprehensive assessment of functional senescence in Drosophila, we evaluated a series of behaviors in control flies of increasing ages. Our studies reveal a novel age-dependent functional decline in the olfactory system and confirm previous reports of age-related locomotor defects in flies. Behavioral responses to electric shock and light are maintained in aged flies. Thus, some sensory systems senesce during the first several weeks of life while others do not. Interestingly, the age-dependent functional declines in olfactory and locomotor systems are indistinguishable in control flies and methuselah, a mutant with enhanced resistance to oxidative stress and increased life span. Our results indicate that enhanced resistance to oxidative stress and extension of life span do not necessarily confer protection from age-related functional declines.",2002,"Eric Cook-Wiens, Michael S Grotewiel, Eric Cook-Wiens, Michael S Grotewiel"
A comparative study of odorant binding protein genes: differential expression of the PBP1-GOBP2 gene cluster in Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera) and the organization of OBP genes in Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera),11914382,,"Insects discriminate odors using sensory organs called olfactory sensilla, which display a wide range of phenotypes. Sensilla express ensembles of proteins, including odorant binding proteins (OBPs), olfactory receptors (ORs) and odor degrading enzymes (ODEs); odors are thought to be transported to ORs by OBPs and subsequently degraded by ODEs. These proteins belong to multigene families. The unique combinatorial expression of specific members of each of these gene families determines, in part, the phenotype of a sensillum and what odors it can detect. Furthermore, OBPs, ORs and ODEs are expressed in different cell types, suggesting the need for cell-cell communication to coordinate their expression. This report examines the OBP gene family. In Manduca sexta, the genes encoding PBP1Msex and GOBP2Msex are sequenced, shown to be adjacent to one another, and characterized together with OBP gene structures of other lepidoptera and Drosophila melanogaster. Expression of PBP1Msex, GOBP1Msex and GOBP2Msex is characterized in adult male and female antenna and in larval antenna and maxilla. The genomic organization of 25 D. melanogaster OBPs are characterized with respect to gene locus, gene cluster, amino acid sequence similarity, exon conservation and proximity to OR loci, and their sequences are compared with 14 M. sexta OBPs. Sensilla serve as portals of important behavioral information, and genes supporting sensilla function are presumably under significant evolutionary selective pressures. This study provides a basis for studying the evolution of the OBP gene family, the regulatory mechanisms governing the coordinated expression of OBPs, ORs and ODEs, and the processes that determine specific sensillum phenotypes.",2002,"Richard G Vogt, Matthew E Rogers, Marie-dominique Franco, Ming Sun, Richard G Vogt, Matthew E Rogers, Marie-dominique Franco, Ming Sun"

We observed a significant decrease in double-strand-break repair with large heterologous insertions located either in cis or in trans to the break. Reestablishing the homology by including the same heterologous sequence in cis and in trans to the double-strand break restored the frequency of gene conversion to wild-type levels. In one instance, an allelic nonhomologous insertion completely abolished repair by homologous recombination. The results show that the repair of a double-strand break by gene conversion requires chromosome pairing in the local region of the double-strand break.",2002,"Angela M Coveny, Tammy Dray, Gregory B Gloor, Angela M Coveny, Tammy Dray, Gregory B Gloor"

The model contains two delay differential equations that describe the dynamics of two core gene products, FRQ and WCC. In a negative feedback loop, FRQ protein represses frq transcription by binding the white-collar complex (WCC), which consists of the WC-1 and WC-2 proteins. In a positive feedback loop, WCC indirectly enhances its own formation. The model simulates circadian oscillations, light entrainment, and a phase-response curve (PRC) similar to experimental PRCs. The Neurospora model is virtually identical to a model describing Drosophila circadian rhythm generation, illustrating that rhythm generation in these divergent organisms shares important mechanistic elements. Significant dynamic differences were found when the parameter spaces of both models were explored to analyze changes in oscillations and bifurcations to steady states. Stochastic fluctuations in molecule numbers were simulated with the Gillespie algorithm. Circadian oscillations and entrainment to light were simulated with <80 molecules of FRQ and WCC present on average. Simulations suggest that in both Neurospora and Drosophila, only the negative feedback loop is essential for circadian oscillations.

Some worm and fly genes have counterparts with related functions in higher animals and many more such correspondences can be expected. Analysis of mutations in mammals can potentially lead to insights into such issues as monogamous versus promiscuous sexual behavior and sexual orientation. Genetic analysis of sexual behavior has implications for understanding how the nervous system generates and controls a complex behavior. It can also help us to gain an appreciation of how behavior is encoded by genes and their regulatory sequences.,2003,"Scott W Emmons, Jonathan Lipton, Scott W Emmons, Jonathan Lipton"
Expression of eukaryotic glycosyltransferases in the yeast Pichia pastoris,12770780,10.1016/s0300-9084(03)00072-5,"The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is often used as an organism for the heterologous expression of proteins and has been used already for production of a number of glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of N- and O-linked oligosaccharides. In our recent studies, we have examined the expression in P. pastoris of Arabidopsis thaliana and Drosophila melanogaster core alpha1,3-fucosyltransferases (EC 2.4.1.214), A. thaliana beta1,2-xylosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.38), bovine beta1,4-galactosyltransferase I (EC 2.4.1.38), D. melanogaster peptide O-xylosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.26), D. melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans beta1,4-galactosyltransferase VII (SQV-3; EC 2.4.1.133) and tomato Lewis-type alpha1,4-fucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.65). Temperature, cell density and medium formulation have varying effects on the amount of activity resulting from expression under the control of either the constitutive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) or inducible alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoters. In the case of the A. thaliana xylosyltransferase these effects were most pronounced, since constitutive expression at 16 degrees C resulted in 30-times more activity than inducible expression at 30 degrees C. Also, the exact nature of the constructs had an effect; whereas soluble forms of the A. thaliana xylosyltransferase and fucosyltransferase were active with N-terminal pentahistidine tags (in the former case facilitating purification of the recombinant protein to homogeneity), a C-terminally tagged form of the A. thaliana fucosyltransferase was inactive. In the case of D. melanogaster beta1,4-galactosyltransferase VII, expression with a yeast secretion signal yielded no detectable activity; however, when a full-length form of the enzyme was introduced into P. pastoris, an active secreted form of the protein was produced.",2003,"Monika BencÃºrovÃ¡, Dubravko Rendi?, GustÃ¡v Fabini, Eva-Maria Kopecky, Friedrich Altmann, Iain B H Wilson, Monika BencÃºrovÃ¡, Dubravko Rendi?, GustÃ¡v Fabini, Eva-Maria Kopecky, Friedrich Altmann, Iain B H Wilson"
The regulation of yp3 expression in the Drosophila melanogaster fat body,12590347,10.1007/s00427-002-0286-4,"The regulation of the Drosophila melanogaster yolk protein genes 1 and 2 have been well characterised. Cis-acting DNA elements and trans-acting factors regulating ovarian fat body and sex-specific expression have been identified. In this paper we have analysed the regulation of yolk protein 3, which is separated from the other two genes on the X-chromosome. We have separated sex-specific control from fat body control in some constructs in transgenic flies. We propose that the organisation of the regulatory elements in yp3 differs from yp1 and yp2 for control of fat body expression and that it closely resembles the regulation of a reporter gene using Musca and Calliphora yp promoter enhancer sequences in transgenic Drosophila.",2003,"Simone F Hutson, Mary Bownes, Simone F Hutson, Mary Bownes"
Genomic regions responsible for manganese superoxide dismutase regulation in Drosophila melanogaster,12934716,10.1046/j.1474-9728.2003.00056.x,"The transcription of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), expression of which is essential for detoxification of superoxide radicals from mitochondria, has been shown to be regulated in vitro by many factors and conditions including oxidative stress, cytokines, lipopolysaccharide, cytoplasmic myc (c-myc), p53 and tumour necrosis factors. Here we describe genomic regions in Drosophila melanogaster with regulatory effects on transcription of the MnSOD gene at an organism-wide level. To understand the integrated regulation of MnSOD expression we screened chromosomes of D. melanogaster to locate deficiencies that altered the expression of MnSOD. Suppressors of MnSOD were screened by assessing the relative message abundance of MnSOD in 149 deletions covering approximately 81% of the Drosophila genome. The chromosomal deficiency Df(2R)017 significantly up-regulated MnSOD mRNA by 1.7-fold. Deficiency in four other genomic intervals, Df(1)ct-J4, Df(2L)BSC4, Df(3L)66C-G28 and Df(3R)Scr, down-regulated MnSOD expression. Changes in MnSOD expression were positively associated with paraquat sensitivity of the deletion genotypes. Thus, at least one candidate enhancer and four candidate suppressors exist in the Drosophila genome to regulate the transcriptional activity of the MnSOD gene in vivo.",2003,"Anirban Paul, Atanu Duttaroy, Anirban Paul, Atanu Duttaroy"
Experimental studies of adult Drosophila chemosensory behaviour,14556951,10.1016/s0376-6357(03)00134-7,"Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful animal model to study the processes underlying behavioural responses to chemical cues. This paper provides a review of the important literature to present recent advances in our understanding of how gustatory and olfactory stimuli are perceived. An overview is given of the experimental procedures currently used to characterize the fly chemosensory behaviour. Since this species provides extremely useful genetic tools, a focus is made on those allowing to manipulate behaviour, and hence to understand its molecular and cellular bases. Such tools include single-gene mutants and the Gal4/UAS system. They can be combined with studies of the natural polymorphism of behavioural responses. Recent data obtained with these various approaches unravel some important aspects of taste and olfaction. These appear as rather complex processes, as revealed by results showing dose-dependence, plasticity and sexual dimorphism. Taken together, these results and the available tools open interesting perspectives for the years to come, in our attempts to make the link between genes and behaviour.",2003,"Jean Marc Devaud, Jean Marc Devaud"

Herein we review the methodology related to the study of circadian rhythms, sleep and anesthesia where arousal, or lack of it, plays an essential role.

Differential requirements for the neurogenic gene almondex during Drosophila melanogaster development,14595834,10.1002/gene.10233,"During early development, the neurogenic genes of Drosophila melanogaster are involved in the control of cell fates in the neurectoderm; almondex (amx) belongs to this category of genes. We have identified the amx locus and rescued the amx embryonic neurogenic phenotype with a 1.5 kb DNA fragment. Using a small deficiency, we generated a new amx mutant background called amx(m), which is a null allele. Besides the characteristic neurogenic maternal effect caused by loss of amx, amx(m) flies display a new imaginal phenotype resembling loss of function of Notch. We describe amx-induced misregulation of the Notch pathway target E(spl) m7 in embryos and genetic interactions between amx and Notch pathway mutants in adult flies.

FISH analysis of Drosophila melanogaster heterochromatin using BACs and P elements,12827380,10.1007/s00412-003-0241-9,"The heterochromatin of chromosomes 2 and 3 of Drosophila melanogaster contains about 30 essential genes defined by genetic analysis.

Moreover, several predicted genes have been identified by annotation of genomic sequence that are associated with polytene chromosome divisions 40, 41 and 80 but their locations on the cytogenetic map of the heterochromatin are still uncertain. To expand our current knowledge of the genetic functions located in heterochromatin, we have performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping to mitotic chromosomes of nine bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) carrying several predicted genes and of 13 P element insertions assigned to the proximal regions of 2R and 3L. We found that 22 predicted genes map to the h46 region of 2R and eight map to the h47 regions of 3L. This amounts to at least 30 predicted genes located in these heterochromatic regions, whereas previous studies detected only seven vital genes.

Logjam encodes a predicted EMP24/GP25 protein that is required for Drosophila oviposition behavior,12750330,,"A newly characterized Drosophila melanogaster gene, logjam (loj), functions in female reproduction by modulating oviposition behavior. The locus encodes at least six overlapping transcripts with unique 5' ends. P-element mutants that express very low levels of loj transcripts are unable to oviposit mature eggs.

Population dynamics of male-killing and non-male-killing spiroplasmas in Drosophila melanogaster,12620825,10.1128/aem.69.3.1428-1434.2003,"The endosymbiotic bacteria Spiroplasma spp. are vertically transmitted through female hosts and are known to cause selective death of male offspring in insects. One strain of spiroplasma, NSRO, causes male killing in Drosophila species, and a non-male-killing variant of NSRO, designated NSRO-A, has been isolated. It is not known why NSRO-A does not kill males. In an attempt to understand the mechanism of male killing, we investigated the population dynamics of NSRO and NSRO-A throughout the developmental course of the laboratory host Drosophila melanogaster by using a quantitative PCR technique. In the early development of the host insect, the titers of NSRO were significantly higher than those of NSRO-A at the first- and second-instar stages, whereas at the egg, third-instar, and pupal stages, the titers of the two spiroplasmas were almost the same. Upon adult emergence, the titers of the two spiroplasmas were similar, around 2 x 10(8) dnaA copy equivalents. However, throughout host aging, the two spiroplasmas showed strikingly different population growth patterns. The titers of NSRO increased exponentially for 3 weeks, attained a peak value of around 4 x 10(9) dnaA copy equivalents per insect, and then decreased. In contrast, the titers of NSRO-A were almost constant throughout the adult portion of the life cycle. In adult females, consequently, the titer of NSRO was significantly higher than the titer of NSRO-A except for a short period just after emergence. Although infection of adult females with NSRO resulted in almost 100% male killing, production of some male offspring was observed within 4 days after emergence when the titers of NSRO were as low as those of NSRO-A. Based on these results, we proposed a threshold density hypothesis for the expression of male killing caused by the spiroplasma. The extents of the bottleneck in the vertical transmission through host generations were estimated to be 5 x 10(-5) for NSRO and 3 x 10(-4) for NSRO-A.",2003,"Hisashi Anbutsu, Takema Fukatsu, Hisashi Anbutsu, Takema Fukatsu"
Primary structure and compartmentalization of Drosophila melanogaster host cell factor,12609738,10.1016/s0378-1119(03)00380-9,"Human host cell factor-1 (HCF-1) is a large, 2035-residue nuclear protein that interacts with cellular and viral transcription factors. It contains an N-terminal kelch domain, C-terminal fibronectin type III (FnIII) domain, and a central region including tandem repeats which act as cleavage sites. A second human HCF-1 related gene encodes a protein with a high degree of homology in both the N-terminal kelch domain and C-terminal FnIII domain, but lacks the central portion and as a result is considerably smaller at 792 residues. A unique HCF orthologue has been found in Caenorhabditis elegans which is structurally more related to HCF-2 than HCF-1. Here we report the cloning and expression of the single Drosophila melanogaster host cell factor orthologue (dHCF). The dHCF is 1500 residues in size, intermediate between HCF-1 and HCF-2 and contains an N-terminal kelch domain, and C-terminal FnIII domain both of which show a very high degree of identity, and a central region of some 700 residues with more limited homology. Despite containing a central region no repeat-related motifs were apparent. The dHCF is expressed as a single unprocessed polypeptide consistent with the lack of the internal HCF-1 processing sites, and exhibits a predominantly nuclear localization. We show that this nuclear localization is dependent on a bipartite nuclear localization signal at the C-terminus of the protein, which contains a long spacer of 20 amino acids between two basic clusters. Finally, we also show that dHCF is unable to rescue the tsBN67 cell cycle arrest phenotype. These results indicate that dHCF is an orthologue of HCF-1, although both proteins might not be functionally exchangeable.",2003,"Ander Izeta, Sophie Malcomber, Peter O'Hare, Ander Izeta, Sophie Malcomber, Peter O'Hare"
An integrated gene annotation and transcriptional profiling approach towards the full gene content of the Drosophila genome,14709175,10.1186/gb-2003-5-1-r3,"Background:
      
    

    
      While the genome sequences for a variety of organisms are now available, the precise number of the genes encoded is still a matter of debate. For the human genome several stringent annotation approaches have resulted in the same number of potential genes, but a careful comparison revealed only limited overlap. This indicates that only the combination of different computational prediction methods and experimental evaluation of such in silico data will provide more complete genome annotations. In order to get a more complete gene content of the Drosophila melanogaster genome, we based our new D. melanogaster whole-transcriptome microarray, the Heidelberg FlyArray, on the combination of the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) annotation and a novel ab initio gene prediction of lower stringency using the Fgenesh software.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here we provide evidence for the transcription of approximately 2,600 additional genes predicted by Fgenesh. Validation of the developmental profiling data by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization indicates a lower limit of 2,000 novel annotations, thus substantially raising the number of genes that make a fly.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The successful design and application of this novel Drosophila microarray on the basis of our integrated in silico/wet biology approach confirms our expectation that in silico approaches alone will always tend to be incomplete. The identification of at least 2,000 novel genes highlights the importance of gathering experimental evidence to discover all genes within a genome.

Conditioning deficits of CaM-kinase transgenic Drosophila melanogaster in a new excitatory courtship assay,14504030,,"Courtship suppression is an associative conditioning procedure in Drosophila melanogaster that is ethologically based and capable of being tested on individual flies. We have expanded the range of the courtship conditioning by developing an excitatory procedure in which male flies learn to associate a novel odor with the courtship stimulating cues of virgin females. Wild-type males normally court other mature males very little, but following training, the odor alone is able to elicit increased levels of courtship towards an object male. Flies expressing an inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) were previously shown to have no retention one hour after training in the courtship suppression task, as manifested in their persistent courting of a virgin female. A possible trivial explanation for this response is that the CaMKII-inhibited fly strains (ala1 and ala2) were merely hyperactive courters. The poor performance of these mutants in the new excitatory conditioning procedure confirms that their conditioning deficit results from a disruption of an associative mechanism per se.",2003,"Susan J Broughton, Tim Tully, Ralph J Greenspan, Susan J Broughton, Tim Tully, Ralph J Greenspan"
"Expression and function of the Ror-family receptor tyrosine kinases during development: lessons from genetic analyses of nematodes, mice, and humans",12680586,10.1081/rrs-120018757,"Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play crucial roles in various developmental processes. Ror-family RTKs are characterized by the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains, highly related to those of the Trk-family RTKs, and by the extracellular Frizzled-like cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) and Kringle domains. Rors are evolutionally conserved among Caenorhabditis elegans, Aplysia, Drosophila melanogaster, Xenopus, mice, and humans. In D. melanogaster and mammals, pairs of structurally related Rors are found, while a single Ror protein is identified in C. elegans or Aplysia. In Aplysia and D. melanogaster, Rors are expressed exclusively in developing nervous systems. On the other hand, rather widespread expression of Rors was observed in C. elegans and mammals. Mutations in Ror of C. elegans cause inappropriate axon outgrowth as well as defects in cell migration and asymmetric cell division. It has also been reported that the nematode Ror possesses kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions. Mouse Rors, Ror1, and Ror2, are expressed mainly in migrating neural crest cells and mesenchymal cells, and Ror2-deficient mice exhibit skeletal abnormalities and ventricular septal defects in the heart. Although Ror1-deficient mice exhibit no apparent skeletal or cardiac abnormalities, Ror1/Ror2 double mutant mice show markedly enhanced skeletal and cardiac abnormalities compared with Ror2 mutant mice, indicating genetic interaction of Ror1 and Ror2. In humans, mutations within Ror2 have been found in two genetic skeletal disorders, recessive Robinow syndrome and dominant Brachydactyly type B (BDB), further emphasizing critical functions of Ror2 during developmental morphogenesis. In this article, we also discuss the signaling machinery mediated by Ror-family RTKs with a particular emphasis on our recent structure-function analyses of Ror-family RTKs.",2003,"Akinori Yoda, Isao Oishi, Yasuhiro Minami, Akinori Yoda, Isao Oishi, Yasuhiro Minami"

We then investigate the possibility of extracting a typical vocabulary through statistical analysis of experimentally confirmed introns of sufficient length (>1 kb), deprived of known splice signals, the focus being on distributed lexical features rather than on localized motifs. Lexical preferences typical of introns could be exposed using principal component analysis of pentanucleotide frequency distributions, both in C. elegans and in Drosophila melanogaster. In either species, the introns' pentamer preferences are largely shared by intergenic tracts. The pentamer vocabularies extracted for the two species exhibit interesting symmetry properties and overlap in part.

However, their in vivo functions and related signaling pathways are not fully understood yet. Here, we show that DTRAF1 is an in vivo regulator of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway in Drosophila melanogaster. Ectopic expression of DTRAF1 in the developing eye induced apoptosis, thereby causing a rough-eye phenotype. Further genetic interaction analyses revealed that the apoptosis in the eye imaginal disc and the abnormal eye morphogenesis induced by DTRAF1 are dependent on JNK and its upstream kinases, Hep and DTAK1. In support of these results, DTRAF1-null mutant showed a remarkable reduction in JNK activity with an impaired development of imaginal discs and a defective formation of photosensory neuron arrays. In contrast, DTRAF2 was demonstrated as an upstream activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Ectopic expression of DTRAF2 induced nuclear translocation of two Drosophila NF-kappaBs, DIF and Relish, consequently activating the transcription of the antimicrobial peptide genes diptericin, diptericin-like protein, and drosomycin. Consistently, the null mutant of DTRAF2 showed immune deficiencies in which NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and antimicrobial gene transcription against microbial infection were severely impaired. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that DTRAF1 and DTRAF2 play pivotal roles in Drosophila development and innate immunity by differentially regulating the JNK- and the NF-kappaB-dependent signaling pathway, respectively.",2003,"Guang-Ho Cha, Kyoung Sang Cho, Jun Hee Lee, Myungjin Kim, Euysoo Kim, Jeehye Park, Sung Bae Lee, Jongkyeong Chung, Guang-Ho Cha, Kyoung Sang Cho, Jun Hee Lee, Myungjin Kim, Euysoo Kim, Jeehye Park, Sung Bae Lee, Jongkyeong Chung"
Metabolic labeling of C. elegans and D. melanogaster for quantitative proteomics,12858183,10.1038/nbt848,"A crucial issue in comparative proteomics is the accurate quantification of differences in protein expression levels. To achieve this, several methods have been developed in which proteins are labeled with stable isotopes either in vivo via metabolic labeling or in vitro by protein derivatization. Although metabolic labeling is the only way to obtain labeling of all proteins, it has thus far only been applied to single- celled organisms and cells in culture. Here we describe quantitative 15N metabolic labeling of the multicellular organisms Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode, and Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly, achieved by feeding them on 15N-labeled Escherichia coli and yeast, respectively. The relative abundance of individual proteins obtained from different samples can then be determined by mass spectrometry (MS). The applicability of the method is exemplified by the comparison of protein expression levels in two C. elegans strains, one with and one without a germ line. The methodology described provides tools for accurate quantitative proteomic studies in these model organisms.",2003,"Jeroen Krijgsveld, RenÃ© F Ketting, Tokameh Mahmoudi, Janik Johansen, Marta Artal-Sanz, C Peter Verrijzer, Ronald H A Plasterk, Albert J R Heck, Jeroen Krijgsveld, RenÃ© F Ketting, Tokameh Mahmoudi, Janik Johansen, Marta Artal-Sanz, C Peter Verrijzer, Ronald H A Plasterk, Albert J R Heck"
"Effect of heat shock, pretreatment and hsp70 copy number on wing development in Drosophila melanogaster",12694280,10.1046/j.1365-294x.2003.01771.x,"Naturally occurring heat shock (HS) during pupation induces abnormal wing development in Drosophila; we examined factors affecting the severity of this induction. The proportion of HS-surviving adults with abnormal wings varied with HS duration and intensity, and with the pupal age or stage at HS administration. Pretreatment (PT), mild hyperthermia delivered before HS, usually protected development against HS. Gradual heating resembling natural thermal regimes also protected wing development against thermal disruption. Because of the roles of the wings in flight and courtship and in view of natural thermal regimes that Drosophila experience, both HS-induction of wing abnormalities and its abatement by PT may have marked effects on Drosophila fitness in nature. Because PT is associated with expression of heat-inducible molecular chaperones such as Hsp70 in Drosophila, we compared thermal disruption of wing development among hsp70 mutants as well as among strains naturally varying in Hsp70 levels. Contrary to expectations, lines or strains with increased Hsp70 levels were no more resistant to HS-disruption of wing development than counterparts with lower Hsp70 levels. In fact, wing development was more resistant to HS in hsp70 deletion strains than control strains. We suggest that, while high Hsp70 levels may aid cells in surviving hyperthermia, high levels may also overly stimulate or inhibit numerous signalling pathways involved in cell proliferation, maturation and programmed death, resulting in developmental failure.",2003,"Karen D Williams, Amanda B Helin, Joseph Posluszny, Stephen P Roberts, Martin E Feder, Karen D Williams, Amanda B Helin, Joseph Posluszny, Stephen P Roberts, Martin E Feder"
"Hill-Robertson interference in Drosophila melanogaster: reply to Marais, Mouchiroud and Duret",12872910,10.1017/s0016672302006067,"The usage of preferred codons in Drosophila melanogaster is reduced in regions of lower recombination. This is consistent with population genetics theory, whereby the effectiveness of selection on multiple targets is limited by stochastic effects caused by linkage. However, because the selectively preferred codons in D. melanogaster end in C or G, it has been argued that base-composition-biasing effects of recombination can account for the observed relationship between preferred codon usage and recombination rate (Marais et al., 2003). Here, we show that the correlation between base composition (of protein-coding and intron regions) and recombination rate holds only for lower values of the latter. This is consistent with a Hill-Robertson interference model and does not support a model whereby the entire effect of recombination on codon usage can be attributed to its potential role in generating compositional bias.",2003,"Richard M Kliman, Jody Hey"
Evolution of sexual dimorphism in the olfactory brain of Hawaiian Drosophila,12803889,10.1098/rspb.2003.2331,"In the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, mate choice during courtship depends on detecting olfactory cues, sex pheromones, which are initially processed in the antennal lobe (AL), a primary olfactory centre of the brain. However, no sexual differences in the structure of the AL have been found in Drosophila. We compared the central brain anatomy of 37 species of Drosophilidae from the islands of the Hawaiian archipelago, uncovering an extreme sexual dimorphism within the AL in which two out of the 51 identifiable glomeruli were markedly enlarged in males. A phylogeny indicated that the sexual dimorphism of the homologous glomeruli arose 0.4-1.9 Myr ago independently in two species groups of Hawaiian endemic Drosophilidae. The corresponding glomeruli in D. melanogaster were also found to be sexually dimorphic. The formation of glomeruli of male size is prevented by the ectopic expression of female-type transformer (tra) cDNA in males, indicating that the glomerular sexual dimorphism is under the control of the sex-determination cascade of genes. It is suggested that a defined set of glomeruli in Drosophila can enlarge in response to sex-determination genetic signals, the mutations of which may result in species differences in sexual dimorphism of the brain.",2003,"Yasuhiro Kondoh, Kenneth Y Kaneshiro, Ken-ichi Kimura, Daisuke Yamamoto, Yasuhiro Kondoh, Kenneth Y Kaneshiro, Ken-ichi Kimura, Daisuke Yamamoto"
Caspase activity and a specific cytochrome C are required for sperm differentiation in Drosophila,12737804,10.1016/s1534-5807(03)00120-5,"The final stage of spermatid terminal differentiation involves the removal of their bulk cytoplasm in a process known as spermatid individualization. Here we show that apoptotic proteins play an essential role during spermatid individualization in Drosophila melanogaster. Several aspects of sperm terminal differentiation, including the activation of caspases, are reminiscent of apoptosis. Notably, caspase inhibitors prevent the removal of bulk cytoplasm in spermatids and block sperm maturation in vivo, causing male sterility. We further identified loss-of-function mutations in one of the two Drosophila cyt-c genes, cyt-c-d, which block caspase activation and subsequent spermatid terminal differentiation. Finally, a giant ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, dBruce, is required to protect the sperm nucleus against hypercondensation and degeneration. These observations suggest that an apoptosis-like mechanism is required for spermatid differentiation in Drosophila.",2003,"Eli Arama, Julie Agapite, Hermann Steller, Eli Arama, Julie Agapite, Hermann Steller"
Proliferation pattern of postembryonic neuroblasts in the brain of Drosophila melanogaster,1728583,10.1016/0012-1606(92)90270-q,"The spatio-temporal proliferation pattern of postembryonic neuroblasts in the central brain region of the supra-esophageal ganglion of Drosophila melanogaster was studied by labeling DNA replicating cells with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU). There are five proliferating neuroblasts per hemisphere in larvae just after hatching: one in the ventro-lateral, and the other four in the postero-dorsal region of the brain. Dividing neuroblasts increase during the late first-late second instar larval stages, reaching a plateau of about 85 neuroblasts per hemisphere. Most neuroblasts cease dividing 20-30 hr after puparium formation (APF), while only four in the postero-dorsal region continue making progenies until 85-90 hr APF. The four distinct neuroblasts proliferating in the early larval and late pupal stages are identical; they lie in the cortex above the calyces of the mushroom bodies (corpora pedunculata), proliferating over a period twice as long as that for the other neuroblasts. Their daughter neurons project into the mushroom body neuropile, and hence are likely to be the Kenyon cells. The cell-cycle period of the four neuroblasts (named mushroom body neuroblasts: MBNbs) is rather constant (1.1-1.5 hr) during the mid larval-early pupal stages and is longer before and after that. The total number of the MBNb progenies made throughout the embryonic and postembryonic development was estimated to be 800-1200 per hemisphere.",1992,"K Ito, Y Hotta, K Ito, Y Hotta"

Energy storage during reproductive diapause in the Drosophila melanogaster species group,1613157,10.1007/BF00357524,"Temperate species of the Drosophila melanogaster group enter reproductive diapause for overwintering in response to short daylength. During the prediapause period they accumulate triacylglycerols, but not glycogen, as energy resources. The capacity for storing triacylglycerols differs between species, and appears to be closely correlated with diapause and cold-hardiness; cool-temperate species, such as those of the auraria species complex, which enter a deep diapause and are highly cold-hardy, accumulate larger quantities of triacylglycerols than warm-temperate species, such as D. rufa and D. lutescens, which enter a weak diapause and are less cold-hardy. Among the cool-temperate species, D. subauraria occurs at a higher latitude and has the greatest capacity for accumulating triacylglycerols. A subtropical species, D. takahashii, which has no diapause in nature and is not cold-hardy, is unable to store the same quantities of triacylglycerols as temperate species.",1992,"T Ohtsu, M T Kimura, S H Hori, T Ohtsu, M T Kimura, S H Hori"
Molecular analysis of the lethal(1)B214 region at the base of the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster,1618027,10.1007/BF00582840,"Approximately 50 kb of genomic DNA was isolated from polytene chromosome bands 19F1 and 2 of Drosophila melanogaster. Bands 19F1 and 2 are in the immediate vicinity of the beta-heterochromatin at the base of the X chromosome and encompass the little fly-like and lethal(1)B214 complementation groups. The cloned DNA consists of an approximately 21 kb stretch of unique or low copy number sequence that is bounded by repetitive elements interspersed with further unique sequences. The presence of repeated sequences is characteristic of regions within and adjacent to beta-heterochromatin. At least part of a tRNA gene cluster is present within the 50 kb of cloned DNA. The cloned region also produces at least 18 discrete size classes of developmentally regulated poly(A)+ RNA species. A 2 kb EcoRI fragment (E10), which lies in the 21 kb stretch of unique sequence, generates seven of these transcripts (of sizes 3.5, 3.35, 2.1, 2.0, 1.5, 1.2 and 1.0 kb) in wild-type flies. However, a small deletion of approximately 75 bp in E10 in a lethal(1)B214 mutant allele is associated with alterations in the production or processing of all seven of these transcripts. These data identify E10 sequences as belonging to the lethal(1)B214 gene and suggest that the wild-type lethal(1)B214 gene encodes multiple transcripts. Furthermore, no transcripts of the same size and having the same developmental profile as those generated by the wild-type E10 fragment were identified by probes covering the remainder of the cloned region. This suggests that at least the larger transcripts hybridizing to E10 are partly transcribed from sequences located outside the cloned region, which indicates that the lethal(1)B214 gene extends for more than 20 kb and contains other transcriptionally active sequences within it.",1992,"R J Russell, M J Healy, J G Oakeshott, R J Russell, M J Healy, J G Oakeshott"

Molecular analysis has shown that fs(2)PM11-19 contains a 5 kb insert within 500 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site of the gsI gene. Mutant flies have extremely low levels of gsI transcription and GSI activity. A pre-existing deficiency (Df(2L) netPM1) with a breakpoint near the transcription start site was also found to be a female-sterile allele of gsI. All eggs laid by PM11-19 homozygous females, as well as by females heterozygous for this mutation and a deletion or any of several recessive lethal alleles of the gsI gene, fail to hatch.

The focus of every screen to date has been on disruption of adult structure or function. Although these loci were originally identified on the basis of viable mutants, some have proven capable of giving rise to lethal alleles. It seems reasonable to assume that mutants which strongly affect development of the imaginal-specific central nervous system may evidence abnormalities during the late larval or pupal stages when the adult central nervous system is undergoing final assembly and might show a lethal phase prior to eclosion (as is true for mutations at the previously defined l(1)ogre locus). We have carried out the first screen of autosomal and sex-linked late larval and pupal lethals to identify mutations that affect the development of the optic lobes.

A total of eight tissues from larval and adult developmental stages representing both gonadal (germ-line) and nongonadal (somatic) tissues were analyzed for protein divergence between species. Close to 400 polypeptides (protein spots) were scored from each tissue and species, and protein divergence was measured on the basis of qualitative differences (presence/absence) of protein spots in pairwise species comparisons. The observed levels of genic divergence varied among tissues and among species. When larval hemolymph proteins (which are known to be highly polymorphic) were excluded, there was no evidence to suggest that either the larval or adult-stage proteins, as a whole, are more diverged than the other; variation between different tissues rather than between developmental stages appears to be the most significant factor affecting genetic divergence between species. The reproductive tissue (testis and accessory gland) showed more divergence than did the nonreproductive tissue; D. melanogaster testis (from both larvae and adult males) showed the highest level of divergence. In view of the previous observation that D. simulans, D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia show similar but significantly less reproductive isolation from each other than from D. melanogaster, the present results suggest a correlation between the levels of reproductive-tract-protein divergence and the degree of reproductive isolation in these species.",1992,"S Thomas, R S Singh, S Thomas, R S Singh"

Progenitor cells for each of these lineages arise from groups of cells, whose elements must decide between taking on either fate. Commitment of the progenitor cells to one of the developmental fates implies two factors. One is intrinsic to the ectodermal cells and determines a propensity to take on neural fate; this factor is probably represented by the products of the so-called proneural genes, which are differentially distributed throughout the ectoderm. The other factor in the cells' decision to adopt one of the two alternative fates is intercellular communication, which is mediated by the products of the so-called neurogenic genes. Two types of interactions, one inhibiting and the other stimulating neural development, have been inferred.

Super-unstable mutations associated with P-M hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,1334025,10.1007/BF00128769,"Super-unstable mutations occasionally appear either in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster or in P-M hybrid dysgenesis.

Each super-unstable mutation gives rise to a large family of new super-unstable mutations with a wide range of phenotypic expression. Mutations with the same phenotype often differ in the specificity of their potential for further mutation. As a rule, a super-unstable mutation is associated with a specific reversible mutation and paired alleles are formed in this way. Other mutations are usually irreversible, but new mutations of these may also form paired alleles. Active transposase encoded by transposable P elements is necessary to maintain super-instability.

Element frequencies per chromosome band were generally low in the distal sections, but were higher proximally. These results are discussed in the light of models of the population dynamics of transposable elements. It is concluded that they provide strong evidence for the operation of a force or forces opposing transpositional increase in copy number. The data suggest that the rate of transposition per element per generation is of the order of 10(-4), for the elements included in this study.",1992,"B Charlesworth, A Lapid, D Canada, B Charlesworth, A Lapid, D Canada"
"Comparative analysis of morphological traits among Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans: genetic variability, clines and phenotypic plasticity",15088656,10.1023/b:gene.0000017639.62427.8b,"The two sibling cosmopolitan species, Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans, are able to proliferate under very different climatic conditions. This has resulted in local adaptations, which are often arranged in latitudinal clines. Such clines are documented for body weight, wing and thorax length, sternopleural and abdominal bristle number, ovariole number and thoracic pigmentation. The overall magnitude of geographical differentiation is, however, much less in D. simulans than in D. melanogaster, and latitudinal clines are less pronounced. The fact that natural populations live under different climates raises the problem of interaction between temperature and phenotype. The reaction norms of morphometrical traits have been investigated as a function of growth temperature. The shapes of the response curves vary according to the investigated trait. They are generally curvilinear and can be described by calculating characteristic values after polynomial adjustments. For a given trait, the reaction norms of the two species are similar in their shape, although some significant differences may be observed. Within each species, significant differences are also observed between geographic populations: reaction norms are not parallel and the divergence is better marked when more distant populations (e.g., temperate and tropical) are compared. It thus appears that besides mean trait value, phenotypic plasticity is also a target of natural selection. A specific analysis of wing shape variation according to growth temperature was also undertaken. Reaction norms with different shapes may be observed in various parts of the wing: the major effect is found between the basis and the tip of the wing, but in a similar way in the two species. By contrast, some ratios, called wing indices by taxonomists, may exhibit completely different reaction norms in the two species. For a single developmental temperature (25 degrees C) the phenotypic variability of morphometrical traits is generally similar in the two species, and also the genetic variability, estimated by the intraclass correlation. A difference exists, however, for the ovariole number which is less variable in D. simulans. Variance parameters may vary according to growth temperature, and a detailed analysis was made on wing dimensions. An increase of environmental variability at extreme, heat or cold temperatures, has been found in both species. Opposite trends were, however, observed for the genetic variability: a maximum heritability in D. simulans at middle temperatures, corresponding to a minimum heritability in D. melanogaster. Whether such a difference exists for other traits and in other populations deserves further investigations. In conclusion, morphometrical analyses reveal a large amount of significant differences which may be related to speciation and to the divergence of ecological niches. Within each species, numerous geographic variations are also observed which, in most cases, reflect some kinds of climatic adaptation.",2004,"P Gibert, P Capy, A Imasheva, B Moreteau, J P Morin, G PÃ©tavy, J R David, P Gibert, P Capy, A Imasheva, B Moreteau, J P Morin, G PÃ©tavy, J R David"
Downstream-of-FGFR is a fibroblast growth factor-specific scaffolding protein and recruits Corkscrew upon receptor activation,15082772,10.1128/mcb.24.9.3769-3781.2004,"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor (FGFR) signaling controls the migration of glial, mesodermal, and tracheal cells in Drosophila melanogaster. Little is known about the molecular events linking receptor activation to cytoskeletal rearrangements during cell migration. We have performed a functional characterization of Downstream-of-FGFR (Dof), a putative adapter protein that acts specifically in FGFR signal transduction in Drosophila. By combining reverse genetic, cell culture, and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that Dof is a specific substrate for the two Drosophila FGFRs. After defining a minimal Dof rescue protein, we identify two regions important for Dof function in mesodermal and tracheal cell migration. The N-terminal 484 amino acids are strictly required for the interaction of Dof with the FGFRs. Upon receptor activation, tyrosine residue 515 becomes phosphorylated and recruits the phosphatase Corkscrew (Csw). Csw recruitment represents an essential step in FGF-induced cell migration and in the activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway. However, our results also indicate that the activation of Ras is not sufficient to activate the migration machinery in tracheal and mesodermal cells. Additional proteins binding either to the FGFRs, to Dof, or to Csw appear to be crucial for a chemotactic response.",2004,"ValÃ©rie Petit, Ute Nussbaumer, Caroline Dossenbach, Markus Affolter, ValÃ©rie Petit, Ute Nussbaumer, Caroline Dossenbach, Markus Affolter"
The sex-ratio trait and its evolution in Drosophila simulans: a comparative approach,15088650,10.1023/b:gene.0000017633.01507.a3,"Sex-ratio X chromosomes, which prevent the production of Y-bearing sperm, have been identified in a dozen Drosophila species covering a wide phylogenetic range. It has not yet been established whether the same ancestral genetic system underlies this type of meiotic drive across the genus, but the biological characteristics and the evolutionary history of species undoubtedly determine the fate of X-linked drivers. The intragenomic conflict they trigger contributes to geographical variation in D. simulans, which shows a sharp contrast between ancestral-stock derived and recently introduced populations. In the former, sex-ratio X chromosomes are widespread and sometimes reach a high frequency, but they are inactivated by strong Y-linked and autosomal drive suppressors. In recently-introduced populations, sex-ratio X chromosomes are generally rare and suppressors are moderate or absent. We discuss how this pattern could be related to the recent geographical expansion of D. simulans, and consider possible reasons why sex-ratio drive apparently does not occur in D. melanogaster.",2004,"D Jutier, N Derome, C Montchamp-Moreau, D Jutier, N Derome, C Montchamp-Moreau"
Sperm size evolution in Drosophila: inter- and intraspecific analysis,15088661,10.1023/b:gene.0000017644.63389.57,"Numerous reports were devoted to the variation of sperm length in relation to sperm competition amongst species. However, studies on intraspecific variations of sperm size are very scarce and the number of sperm measured, very limited. This paper investigates within-individual, between-individual and between-population variation of sperm length in the two cosmopolitan species, D. simulans and D. melanogaster. Sperm length distributions are completely discriminated against with these two species, with the mean values equal to 1.121 +/- 0.002 and 1.989 +/- 0.008 mm, respectively. Results of intraspecific variation show a contrasting pattern between the two species. The mode of sperm length distributions is much less variable in D. simulans than in D. melanogaster. The sperm size divergence is unaffected whenever the two species are in sympatry (tested at 'Evolution Canyon', Mount Carmel, Israel) or in allopatry, but the two species react differentially to abiotic local factors. D. melanogaster, in contrast to D. simulans, shows a clinal pattern in sperm size associated with drought. We discussed this pattern in relation to the potential role of sperm length in the ongoing process of non-random mating and incipient sympatric speciation observed in this locality in D. melanogaster.",2004,"Dominique Joly, Abraham Korol, Eviatar Nevo, Dominique Joly, Abraham Korol, Eviatar Nevo"
Architectural arrangement of cloned proximal sequence element-binding protein subunits on Drosophila U1 and U6 snRNA gene promoters,14966271,10.1128/mcb.24.5.1897-1906.2004,"Transcription of snRNA genes by either RNA polymerase II (U1 to U5) or RNA polymerase III (U6) is dependent upon a proximal sequence element (PSE) located approximately 40 to 60 bp upstream of the transcription start site. In Drosophila melanogaster, RNA polymerase specificity is determined by as few as three nucleotide differences within the otherwise well-conserved 21-bp PSE. Previous photo-cross-linking studies revealed that the D. melanogaster PSE-binding protein, DmPBP, contains three subunits (DmPBP45, DmPBP49, and DmPBP95) that associate with the DNA to form complexes that are conformationally distinct depending upon whether the protein is bound to a U1 or a U6 PSE. We have identified and cloned the genes that code for these subunits of DmPBP by virtue of their similarity to three of the five subunits of SNAP(c), the human PBP. When expressed in S2 cells, each of the three cloned gene products is incorporated into a protein complex that functionally binds to a PSE. We also find that the conformational difference referred to above is particularly pronounced for DmPBP45, herein identified as the ortholog of human SNAP43. DmPBP45 cross-linked strongly to DNA for two turns of the DNA helix downstream of the U1 PSE, but it cross-linked strongly for only a half turn of the helix downstream of a U6 PSE. These substantial differences in the cross-linking pattern are consistent with those of a model in which conformational differences in DmPBP-DNA complexes lead to selective RNA polymerase recruitment to U1 and U6 promoters.",2004,"Cheng Li, Gale A Harding, Jason Parise, Kathleen J McNamara-Schroeder, William E Stumph, Cheng Li, Gale A Harding, Jason Parise, Kathleen J McNamara-Schroeder, William E Stumph"
The respiratory pattern in Drosophila melanogaster selected for desiccation resistance is not associated with the observed evolution of decreased locomotory activity,15057713,10.1086/381467,"We examined spontaneous locomotory behavior and respiratory pattern in replicate outbred populations of Drosophila melanogaster selected for desiccation resistance or starvation resistance, as well as their control and ancestral populations. Use of these populations allows us to compare evolved behavioral changes in response to different stress selections. We also reasoned that previously observed changes in respiratory patterns following selection for increased desiccation resistance might be associated with or even caused by changes in locomotory behavior. We measured spontaneous locomotory behavior using video recordings and a computer-based tracking system while simultaneously measuring patterns of CO(2) release from single fruit flies. Statistically significant differences in behavior were observed to be correlated with selection regime. Reduced levels of spontaneous locomotory activity were observed in moist air in both desiccation- and starvation-selected populations compared with their controls. Interestingly, in dry air, only the desiccation-selected flies continue to show reduced spontaneous locomotory activity. No correlation was found between the level of locomotory activity of individual flies and the respiratory patterns of those flies, indicating that the reduced activity levels that have evolved in these flies did not directly cause the documented changes in their respiratory pattern.",2004,"Adrienne E Williams, Michael R Rose, Timothy J Bradley, Adrienne E Williams, Michael R Rose, Timothy J Bradley"
[Sterilizing effect of the mutant allele sbr10 (l(1)ts403) in compound with null alleles in Drosophila melanogaster females],15174279,,"In females of Df(1)v-L4/+(0/+) genotype, the presence of the wild-type allele of small bristles (sbr) gene in a single dose has no significant effect on their fecundity, whereas a reduced dose of the temperature-sensitive allele sbr10(l(1)ts403) causes a strong sterilizing effect in females Df(1)v-L4/sbr10 (0/sbr10) at permissive temperature. We studied the contribution to this effects of the following factors: resorption of egg chambers, decreased oviposition, offspring death at the embryonic and larval stages, and reduced fecundity in females 0/sbr10. Sterilizing effect of the mutant sbr10 allele proved to be primarily caused by offspring lethality at the embryonic and first-instar larval stages. In 0/+ females, the majority of undeveloped eggs contained embryos that perished at the late developmental stages, whereas in females 0/sbr10, at least 50% of undeveloped egg showed no visible signs of development or the embryo development was arrested at early stages of embryogenesis.

The physiological properties of a novel family of VDAC-like proteins from Drosophila melanogaster,14695259,10.1016/S0006-3495(04)74093-X,"VDAC, a major protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane, forms voltage-dependent, anion-selective channels permeable to most metabolites. Although multiple isoforms of VDAC have been found in different organisms, only one isoform (porin/DVDAC) has been previously reported for Drosophila melanogaster. We have examined the physiological properties of three other Drosophila proteins (CG17137, CG17139, and CG17140) whose primary sequences have significant homology to DVDAC. A comparison of their hydropathy profiles (beta-pattern) with known VDAC sequences indicates the same fundamental folding pattern but with major insertions and deletions. The ability of these proteins to form channels was tested on planar membranes and liposomes. Channel activity was observed with varying degrees of similarity to VDAC. Two of these proteins (CG17137 and CG17140) produced channels with anionic selectivity in the open state. Sometimes channels exhibited closure and voltage gating, but for CG17140 this occurred at much higher voltages than is typical for VDAC. CG17139 was not able to form channels. DVDAC and CG17137 were able to rescue the temperature-sensitive conditional-lethal phenotype of VDAC-deficient yeast, whereas CG17139 and CG17140 demonstrated no complementation. Similar structure and channel formation indicate that VDAC-like proteins are part of the larger VDAC family but the modifications are indicative of specialized functions.",2004,"Alexander G Komarov, Brett H Graham, William J Craigen, Marco Colombini, Alexander G Komarov, Brett H Graham, William J Craigen, Marco Colombini"

Female resistance to male harm evolves in response to manipulation of sexual conflict,15212383,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2004.tb00436.x,"The interests of males and females over reproduction rarely coincide and conflicts between the sexes over mate choice, mating frequency, reproductive investment, and parental care are common in many taxa. In Drosophila melanogaster, the optimum mating frequency is higher for males than it is for females. Furthermore, females that mate at high frequencies suffer significant mating costs due to the actions of male seminal fluid proteins. Sexual conflict is predicted to lead to sexually antagonistic coevolution, in which selection for adaptations that benefit males but harm females is balanced by counterselection in females to minimize the extent of male-induced harm. We tested the prediction that elevated sexual conflict should select for increased female resistance to male-induced harm and vice versa. We manipulated the intensity of sexual conflict by experimentally altering adult sex ratio. We created replicated lines of D. melanogaster in which the adult sex ratio was male biased (high conflict lines), equal (intermediate conflict lines), or female biased (low conflict lines). As predicted, females from high sexual conflict lines lived significantly longer in the presence of males than did females from low conflict lines. Our conclusion that the evolutionary response in females was to the level of male-induced harm is supported by the finding that there were no female longevity differences in the absence of males. Differences between males in female harming ability were not detected. This suggests that the response in females was to differences between selection treatments in mating frequency, and not to differences in male harmfulness.",2004,"Stuart Wigby, Tracey Chapman, Stuart Wigby, Tracey Chapman"

The result, when combined with the overall incidence and pattern of reports for six other genes (Adh, Gpdh, Pgm, G6pd, 6Pgd, Hex-C), presents a picture of latitudinal clines in metabolic genes prevalent around the branch point of competing pathways.

The control experiments show that the impairment could not be ascribed to any apparent sensorimotor problems in Drosophila. The reverse shift from hypomagnetic field (HMF) to natural GMF restored the GMF-free induced amnesia fully after six consecutive generations.

Wolbachia infections in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans: polymorphism and levels of cytoplasmic incompatibility,15088646,10.1023/b:gene.0000017629.31383.8f,"Wolbachia are endosymbiotic bacteria, widespread in terrestrial Arthropods. They are mainly transmitted vertically, from mothers to offspring and induce various alterations of their hosts' sexuality and reproduction, the most commonly reported phenomenon being Cytoplasmic Incompatibility (CI), observed in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. Basically, CI results in a more or less intense embryonic mortality, occurring in crosses between males infected by Wolbachia and uninfected females. In D. simulans, Wolbachia and CI were observed in 1986. Since then, this host species has become a model system for investigating the polymorphism of Wolbachia infections and CI. In this review we describe the different Wolbachia infections currently known to occur in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. The two species are highly contrasting with regard to symbiotic diversity: while five Wolbachia variants have been described in D. simulans natural populations, D. melanogaster seems to harbor one Wolbachia variant only. Another marked difference between these two Drosophila species is their permissiveness with regard to CI, which seems to be fully expressed in D. simulans but partially or totally repressed in D. melanogaster, demonstrating the involvement of host factors in the control of CI levels.

Drosophila melanogaster GRD and LCCH3 subunits form heteromultimeric GABA-gated cation channels,15148245,10.1038/sj.bjp.0705818,"In addition to its action as a fast inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is thought to mediate excitatory action by activating cation currents in some cell types in invertebrates. However, to date no GABA receptor capable of mediating such action has been identified at the molecular level in insects. Using a systematic expression screening approach, we found that the Drosophila ligand-gated ion channel subunits GRD and LCCH3 combine to form cation-selective GABA-gated ion channels when coexpressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The heteromultimeric receptor is activated by GABA (EC50=4.5 microm), muscimol (EC50=4.8 microm) and trans-4-aminocrotonic acid (EC50=104.5 microm), and partially by cis-4-aminocrotonic acid (EC50=106.3 microm). Picrotoxin effectively blocked the GABA-gated channel (IC50=0.25 microm), but bicuculline, TPMTA, dieldrin and lindane did not.

GABAergic modulation of motor-driven behaviors in juvenile Drosophila and evidence for a nonbehavioral role for GABA transport,15389689,10.1002/neu.20061,"We have identified specific GABAergic-modulated behaviors in the juvenile stage of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster via systemic treatment of second instar larvae with the potent GABA transport inhibitor DL-2,4-diaminobutyric acid (DABA). DABA significantly inhibited motor-controlled body wall and mouth hook contractions and impaired rollover activity and contractile responses to touch stimulation. The perturbations in locomotion and rollover activity were reminiscent of corresponding DABA-induced deficits in locomotion and the righting reflex observed in adult flies. The effects were specific to these motor-controlled behaviors, because DABA-treated larvae responded normally in olfaction and phototaxis assays. Recovery of these behaviors was achieved by cotreatment with the vertebrate GABA(A) receptor antagonist picrotoxin. Pharmacological studies performed in vitro with plasma membrane vesicles isolated from second instar larval tissues verified the presence of high-affinity, saturable GABA uptake mechanisms. GABA uptake was also detected in plasma membrane vesicles isolated from behaviorally quiescent stages. Competitive inhibition studies of [3H]-GABA uptake into plasma membrane vesicles from larval and pupal tissues with either unlabeled GABA or the transport inhibitors DABA, nipecotic acid, or valproic acid, revealed differences in affinities. GABAergic-modulation of motor behaviors is thus conserved between the larval and adult stages of Drosophila, as well as in mammals and other vertebrate species. The pharmacological studies reveal shared conservation of GABA transport mechanisms between Drosophila and mammals, and implicate the involvement of GABA and GABA transporters in regulating physiological processes distinct from neurotransmission during behaviorally quiescent stages of development.",2004,"Sandra M Leal, Nitin Kumar, Wendi S Neckameyer, Sandra M Leal, Nitin Kumar, Wendi S Neckameyer"

Evolution of developmental genes: molecular microevolution of enhancer sequences at the Ubx locus in Drosophila and its impact on developmental phenotypes,14660693,10.1093/molbev/msh025,"Homeotic genes, which function to specify segment identity along the anterior-posterior axis of embryos, are controlled by extensive batteries of enhancer sequences. We have investigated patterns of interspecific and intraspecific molecular variation in three enhancers of the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) locus, which are bx-32.8, pbx32.7, and bxd4.1, from the Drosophila melanogaster species group. These enhancer sequences control Ubx expression by binding to multiple transcription factors encoded by gap, pair-rule, and dorsoventrally expressed genes. Sequence comparisons reveal purifying selection acting on all three enhancers, both in bases binding transcription factors and in bases whose functions are as yet unknown. Neutrality tests largely fail to reject a neutral evolution model. However, using a matrix similarity value to reflect the binding affinity of the protein-binding sites, interspecific and intraspecific variation that may have potential to affect the binding affinity of the sequences homologous to those binding transcription factors in D. melanogaster are discovered, suggesting evolutionary flexibility in the way in which these sequences function in the control of development. As a means of measuring the impact of intraspecific variation on observable phenotypes, we have induced Ubx mutant phenocopies with embryonic ether treatment, and find strong and highly significant variation between D. melanogaster strains in their phenocopy frequencies. This variation shows no significant correlation with the strengths of the mutant phenotypes when the strains are heterozygous with a Ubx null mutation. Estimated phylogenetic trees have been constructed for the three enhancer regions investigated.

Furthermore, because Drosophila are RNAi responsive, the results obtained from experiments performed on cultured cells can be confirmed in the whole organism. RNAi takes advantage of the unique ability of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules to induce gene silencing in a highly specific manner. This phenomenon is efficacious and long lived, being passed to subsequent generations in Drosophila cell culture. To date, many Drosophila cell lines tested respond to dsRNAs by ablating expression of the target protein. Furthermore, all dsRNAs tested have been efficacious at silencing the target gene.

Drosha RNase III catalyzes the first excision event, the release in the nucleus of a hairpin RNA (pre-miRNA), which is followed by export of the pre-miRNA to the cytoplasm and further processing by Dicer to mature miRNAs. Here, we characterize the human DGCR8, the DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8, and its Drosophila melanogaster homolog. We provide biochemical and cell-based readouts to demonstrate the requirement of DGCR8 for the maturation of miRNA primary transcripts.

DmPorin2 forms voltage-independent cation-selective pores,15054101,10.1074/jbc.M310572200,"Mitochondrial porins or voltage-dependent anion-selective channels are channel-forming proteins mainly found in the mitochondrial outer membrane. Genome sequencing of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster revealed the presence of three additional porin-like genes. No functional information was available for the different gene products. In this work we have studied the function of the gene product closest to the known Porin gene (CG17137 coding for DmPorin2). Its coding sequence was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant DmPorin2 protein is able to form channels similar to those formed by DmPorin1 reconstituted in artificial membranes. Furthermore, DmPorin2 is clearly voltage-independent and cation-selective, whereas its counterpart isoform 1 is voltage-dependent and anion-selective. Sequence comparison of the two porin isoforms indicates the exchange of four lysines in DmPorin1 for four glutamic acids in DmPorin2. We have mutated two of them (Glu-66 and Glu-163) to lysines to investigate their role in the functional features of the pore. The mutants E163K and E66K/E163K are endowed with an almost full inversion of the ion selectivity. Both single mutations partially restore the voltage dependence of the pore. We found that an additional effect with the double mutant E66K/E163K was the restoration of voltage dependence. Protein structure predictions highlight a 16 beta-strand pattern, typical for porins. In a three-dimensional model of DmPorin2, Glu-66 and Glu-163 are close to the rim of the channel, on two opposite sides. DmPorin2 is expressed in all the fly tissues and in all the developmental stages tested. Our main conclusions are as follows. 1) The CG17137 gene may express a porin with a functional role in D. melanogaster. 2) We have identified two amino acids of major relevance for the voltage dependence of the porin pore.",2004,"Rita Aiello, Angela Messina, Bettina Schiffler, Roland Benz, Gianluca Tasco, Rita Casadio, Vito De Pinto, Rita Aiello, Angela Messina, Bettina Schiffler, Roland Benz, Gianluca Tasco, Rita Casadio, Vito De Pinto"
Identification and molecular cloning of a functional GDP-fucose transporter in Drosophila melanogaster,15530860,10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.08.043,"Nucleotide sugar transporters play a central role in the process of glycosylation. They are responsible for the translocation of nucleotide sugars from the cytosol, their site of synthesis, into the Golgi apparatus where the activated sugars serve as substrates for a variety of glycosyltransferases. We and others have recently identified and cloned the first GDP-fucose transporters of H. sapiens and C. elegans. Based on sequence similarity, we could identify a putative homolog in Drosophila melanogaster showing about 45% identity on protein level. The gene (CG9620) encodes a highly hydrophobic, multi-transmembrane spanning protein of 38.1 kDa that is localized in the Golgi apparatus. In order to test whether this protein serves as a GDP-fucose transporter, we performed complementation studies with fibroblasts from a patient with LADII (leukocyte adhesion deficiency II) which exhibit a strong reduction of fucosylation due to a point mutation in the human GDP-fucose transporter gene. We show that transient transfection of these cells with the Drosophila CG9620 cDNA corrects the GDP-fucose transport defect and reestablishes fucosylation. This study gives experimental proof that the product of the in silico identified Drosophila gene CG9620 serves as a functional GDP-fucose transporter.",2004,"Kerstin LÃ¼hn, Anna Laskowska, Jan Pielage, Christian KlÃ¤mbt, Ute Ipe, Dietmar Vestweber, Martin K Wild, Kerstin LÃ¼hn, Anna Laskowska, Jan Pielage, Christian KlÃ¤mbt, Ute Ipe, Dietmar Vestweber, Martin K Wild"
"A reanalysis of protein polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia and D. mauritiana: effects of population size and selection",15088651,10.1023/b:gene.0000017634.17098.aa,"Comparison of synonymous and nonsynonymous variation/substitution within and between species at individual genes has become a widely used general approach to detect the effect of selection versus drift. The sibling species group comprised of two cosmopolitan (Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans) and two island (Drosophila mauritiana and Drosophila sechellia) species has become a model system for such studies. In the present study we reanalyzed the pattern of protein variation in these species, and the results were compared against the patterns of nucleotide variation obtained from the literature, mostly available for melanogaster and simulans. We have mainly focused on the contrasting patterns of variation between the cosmopolitan pair. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) As expected the island species D. mauritiana and D. sechellia showed much less variation than the cosmopolitan species D. melanogaster and D. simulans. (2) The chromosome 2 showed significantly less variation than chromosome 3 and X in all four species which may indicate effects of past selective sweeps. (3) In contrast to its overall low variation, D. mauritiana showed highest variation for X-linked loci which may indicate introgression from its sibling, D. simulans. (4) An average population of D. simulans was as heterozygous as that of D. melanogaster (14.4% v.s. 13.9%) but the difference was large and significant when considering only polymorphic loci (37.2% v.s. 26.1%). (5) The species-wise pooled populations of these two species showed similar results (all loci = 18.3% v.s. 20.0%, polymorphic loci = 47.2% v.s. 37.6%). (6) An average population of D. simulans had more low-frequency alleles than D. melanogaster, and the D. simulans alleles were found widely distributed in all populations whereas the D. melanogaster alleles were limited to local populations. As a results of this, pooled populations of D. melanogaster showed more polymorphic loci than those of D. simulans (48.0% v.s. 32.0%) but the difference was reduced when the comparison was made on the basis of an average population (29.1% v.s. 21.4%). (7) While the allele frequency distributions within populations were nonsignificant in both D. melanogaster and D. simulans, melanogaster had fewer than simulans, but more than expected from the neutral theory, low frequency alleles. (8) Diallelic loci with the second allele with a frequency less than 20% had similar frequencies in all four species but those with the second allele with a frequency higher than 20% were limited to only melanogaster the latter group of loci have clinal (latitudinal) patterns of variation indicative of balancing selection. (9) The comparison of D. simulans/D. melanogaster protein variation gave a ratio of 1.04 for all loci and 1.42 for polymorphic loci, against a ratio of approximately 2-fold difference for silent nucleotide sites. This suggests that the species ratios of protein and silent nucleotide polymorphism are too close to call for selective difference between silent and allozyme variation in D. simulans. In conclusion, the contrasting levels of allozyme polymorphism, distribution of rare alleles, number of diallelic loci and the patterns of geographic differentiation between the two species suggest the role of natural selection in D. melanogaster, and of possibly ancient population structure and recent worldwide migration in D. simulans. Population size differences alone are insufficient as an explanation for the patterns of variation between these two species.",2004,"Richard A Morton, Madhu Choudhary, Marie-Louise Cariou, Rama S Singh"
The quantitative genetic basis of male mating behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,15280239,10.1534/genetics.103.024372,"Male mating behavior is an important component of fitness in Drosophila and displays segregating variation in natural populations. However, we know very little about the genes affecting naturally occurring variation in mating behavior, their effects, or their interactions. Here, we have mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting courtship occurrence, courtship latency, copulation occurrence, and copulation latency that segregate between a D. melanogaster strain selected for reduced male mating propensity (2b) and a standard wild-type strain (Oregon-R). Mating behavior was assessed in a population of 98 recombinant inbred lines derived from these two strains and QTL affecting mating behavior were mapped using composite interval mapping. We found four QTL affecting male mating behavior at cytological locations 1A;3E, 57C;57F, 72A;85F, and 96F;99A. We used deficiency complementation mapping to map the autosomal QTL with much higher resolution to five QTL at 56F5;56F8, 56F9;57A3, 70E1;71F4, 78C5;79A1, and 96F1;97B1. Quantitative complementation tests performed for 45 positional candidate genes within these intervals revealed 7 genes that failed to complement the QTL: eagle, 18 wheeler, Enhancer of split, Polycomb, spermatocyte arrest, l(2)05510, and l(2)k02206.

The organization and evolution of the dipteran and hymenopteran Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) genes,15383675,10.1261/rna.7105504,"The Drosophila melanogaster Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) gene encodes an axon guidance receptor and can generate 38,016 different isoforms via the alternative splicing of 95 variable exons. Dscam contains 10 immunoglobulin (Ig), six Fibronectin type III, a transmembrane (TM), and cytoplasmic domains. The different Dscam isoforms vary in the amino acid sequence of three of the Ig domains and the TM domain. Here, we have compared the organization of the Dscam gene from three members of the Drosophila subgenus (D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, and D. virilis), the mosquito Anopheles gambiae, and the honeybee Apis mellifera. Each of these organisms contains numerous alternative exons and can potentially synthesize tens of thousands of isoforms. Interestingly, most of the alternative exons in one species are more similar to one another than to the corresponding alternative exons in the other species. These observations provide strong evidence that many of the alternative exons have arisen by reiterative exon duplication and deletion events. In addition, these findings suggest that the expression of a large Dscam repertoire is more important for the development and function of the insect nervous system than the actual sequence of each isoform.",2004,"Brenton R Graveley, Amardeep Kaur, Dorian Gunning, S Lawrence Zipursky, Lee Rowen, James C Clemens, Brenton R Graveley, Amardeep Kaur, Dorian Gunning, S Lawrence Zipursky, Lee Rowen, James C Clemens"

Eight were entirely novel and encoded by five not yet annotated genes; only two genes had a homologue in the Anopheles gambiae genome. Seven of the eight peptides did not show relevant sequence homology to any known peptide. Therefore, no evidence towards the physiological role of these 'orphan' peptides was available. We identified one of the eight peptides, IPNamide, in an extract of the Drosophila adult brain as well. Next, specific antisera were raised to reveal the distribution pattern of IPNamide and other peptides from the same precursor, in larval and adult brains by means of whole-mount immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. IPNamide immunoreactivity is abundantly present in both stages and a striking similarity was found between the distribution patterns of IPNamide and TPAEDFMRFamide, a member of the FMRFamide peptide family.

Nucleotide variation and recombination along the fourth chromosome in Drosophila simulans,15126398,10.1534/genetics.166.4.1783,"The fourth chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster and its sister species are believed to be nonrecombining and have been a model system for testing predictions of the effects of selection on linked, neutral variation. We recently examined nucleotide variation along the chromosome of D. melanogaster and revealed that a low average level of recombination could be associated with considerably high levels of nucleotide variation. In this report, we further investigate the variation along the fourth chromosome of D. simulans. We sequenced 12 gene regions evenly distributed along the fourth chromosome for a worldwide collection of 11 isofemale lines and 5 gene regions in a local population of 10 isofemale lines from South America. In contrast to predictions for regions of very low recombination, these data reveal that the variation levels in many gene regions, including an intron region of the ci gene, vary considerably along the fourth chromosome. Nucleotide diversity ranged from 0.0010 to 0.0074 in 9 gene regions interspersed with several regions of greatly reduced variation. Tests of recombination indicate that the recombination level is not as low as previously thought, likely an order of magnitude higher than that in D. melanogaster. Finally, estimates of the recombination parameters are shown to support a crossover-plus-conversion model.",2004,"Wen Wang, Kevin Thornton, J J Emerson, Manyuan Long, Wen Wang, Kevin Thornton, J J Emerson, Manyuan Long"

Although the general principles of imaginal disc regeneration have been extensively studied, knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms is far from complete. Results from other model organisms suggest that regeneration is the result of local recapitulation of the normal patterning genes. To analyze the dynamics of one major Drosophila patterning gene, decapentaplegic (dpp), in wing imaginal disc regeneration, a vital GFP reporter together with iontophoretic cell labeling were used. Our observations reveal that the restoration of compartment-border-specific dpp expression is a common event in imaginal disc regeneration.

Ability of scalloped deletion constructs to rescue sd mutant wing phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster,15499399,10.1139/g04-060,"Scalloped (SD) and Vestigial (VG) proteins physically interact to form a selector complex that activates genes involved in wing development in Drosophila melanogaster. SD belongs to a conserved family of transcription factors containing the TEA/ATTS DNA-binding motif. VG is also a nuclear protein providing the activator function for the SD VG complex. The TEA DNA-binding domain and the VG interacting domain (VID) of SD have been previously identified and described. However, they, and possibly other functional domains of SD, have not been thoroughly characterized in vivo. Herein, transgenic constructs encoding various truncations of SD were used to assess their respective ability to rescue the mutant wing phenotype of two viable sd recessive mutations (sd(ETX4) and sd(58d)). The transgenic strains produced were also tested for the ability to induce further sd expression, an ability possessed by full length SD. The functional dissection of SD confirms that specific regions are necessary for wing development and provides further information as to how the SD VG complex functions to promote wing fate. Previous experiments have shown that expression of full length SD can cause a dominant negative wing phenotype. We show that expression of constructs that delete the SD DNA-binding domain can also cause a dominant negative phenotype in a background with either of the two tester sd strains. In contrast, SD constructs that delete the VID have no effect on the wing phenotype in either tester background. Finally, a significant portion of SD at the N-terminal end appears to be dispensable with respect to normal wing development, as this construct behaves the same as full length SD in our assays.",2004,"Leola Chow, Joel Berube, Alice Fromont, John B Bell, Leola Chow, Joel Berube, Alice Fromont, John B Bell"
Pairing between gypsy insulators facilitates the enhancer action in trans throughout the Drosophila genome,16227580,10.1128/MCB.25.21.9283-9291.2005,"The Suppressor of the Hairy wing [Su(Hw)] binding region within the gypsy retrotransposon is the best known chromatin insulator in Drosophila melanogaster. According to previous data, two copies of the gypsy insulator inserted between an enhancer and a promoter neutralize each other's actions, which is indicative of an interaction between the protein complexes bound to the insulators. We have investigated the role of pairing between the gypsy insulators located on homologous chromosomes in trans interaction between yellow enhancers and a promoter. It has been shown that trans activation of the yellow promoter strongly depends on the site of the transposon insertion, which is evidence for a role of surrounding chromatin in homologous pairing. The presence of the gypsy insulators in both homologous chromosomes even at a distance of 9 kb downstream from the promoter dramatically improves the trans activation of yellow. Moreover, the gypsy insulators have proved to stabilize trans activation between distantly located enhancers and a promoter.

Here, we report that inactivation of Scythe in the mouse results in lethality associated with pronounced developmental defects in the lung, kidney, and brain. In all cases, these developmental defects were associated with dysregulation of apoptosis and cellular proliferation. Scythe-/- cells were also more resistant to apoptosis induced by menadione and thapsigargin.

To assess AKH general physiological rules, we ablated AKH endocrine cells by specifically driving the expression of apoptosis transgenes in AKH cells. Trehalose levels were decreased in larvae and starved adults, when the stimulation by AKH of the production of trehalose from fat body glycogen is no longer possible. Moreover, we show that these adults without AKH cells become progressively hypoactive. Finally, under starvation conditions, those hypoactive AKH-knockout cell flies survived approximately 50% longer than control wild-type flies, suggesting that the slower rate at which AKH-ablated flies mobilize their energy resources extends their survival.",2005,"Guillaume Isabel, Jean-RenÃ© Martin, Saad Chidami, Jan A Veenstra, Philippe Rosay, Guillaume Isabel, Jean-RenÃ© Martin, Saad Chidami, Jan A Veenstra, Philippe Rosay"

We observed much heritable variation between lines in age-specific metabolic rates, evidence for genotype x age interaction, and moderate to large heritabilities at all ages except the youngest. Four traits exhibit evidence of coordinate genetic control: day 16 and day 29 metabolic rates, life span in population cages, and life span in vials. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for those traits map to the same locations on three major chromosomes, and additive genetic effects are all positively correlated. In contrast, metabolic rates at the youngest and oldest ages are unrelated to metabolic rates at other ages and to survival. We suggest that artificial selection for long life via delayed reproduction also selects for increased metabolism at intermediate ages. Contrary to predictions of the ""rate of living"" theory, we find no evidence that metabolic rate varies inversely with survival, at the level of either line means or additive effects of QTL.",2005,"Aziz A Khazaeli, Wayne Van Voorhies, James W Curtsinger, Aziz A Khazaeli, Wayne Van Voorhies, James W Curtsinger"

Pyx was opened by temperatures above 40 degrees C in Xenopus laevis oocytes and HEK293T cells. It was ubiquitously expressed along the dendrites of a subset of peripheral nervous system neurons and was more permeable to K(+) than to Na(+). Although some pyx alleles resulted in abnormal temperature preferences, pyx null flies did not have significantly different temperature preferences than wild-type flies. But 60% of pyx null flies were paralyzed within 3 min of exposure to 40 degrees C, whereas only 9% of wild-type flies were paralyzed by the same stimulus.

Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) shows that tubules express those genes encoding components of the Imd pathway. Furthermore, isolated tubules bind and respond to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), by upregulating anti-microbial peptide (diptericin) gene expression and increased bacterial killing. Excised, LPS-challenged tubules, as well as tubules from LPS-infected flies, display increased NO synthase (NOS) activity upon immune challenge. Targetted expression of a Drosophila NOS (dNOS) transgene to only principal cells of the tubule main segment using the GAL4/UAS system increases diptericin expression.

Insulin signaling is necessary for vitellogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster independent of the roles of juvenile hormone and ecdysteroids: female sterility of the chico1 insulin signaling mutation is autonomous to the ovary,15890189,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2004.12.013,"It has been suggested that insulin signaling mutations of Drosophila melanogaster are sterile and long-lived because of juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroid deficiency. However, female sterility of an insulin/IGF-like signaling mutant (chico(1)) of D. melanogaster is not mediated by downstream systemic signaling in terms of major alterations in JH or ecdysteroid levels. chico(1) is a null mutation in the insulin substrate protein (CHICO) gene of D. melanogaster. Homozygous chico(1) females are sterile and their oocytes do not mature beyond the last previtellogenic stage. Homozygous chico(1) females exhibit approximately wild-type rates of JH biosynthesis, ovarian release of ecdysteroids and haemolymph ecdysteroid levels, suggesting that these two major hormone systems play no role in producing the sterility. Previtellogenic wild-type ovaries transplanted into homozygous chico(1) females underwent vitellogenesis, showing that systemic factors present in mutant females are sufficient to support normal vitellogenesis. chico(1) ovaries transplanted into wild-type females did not undergo vitellogenesis indicating that CHICO is necessary in the ovary for vitellogenic maturation.

Impairment of cytotype regulation of P-element activity in Drosophila melanogaster by mutations in the Su(var)205 gene,15998729,10.1534/genetics.102.001594,"Cytotype regulation of transposable P elements in the germ line of Drosophila melanogaster is associated with maternal transmission of P elements inserted at the left telomere of the X chromosome. This regulation is impaired in long-term stocks heterozygous for mutations in Suppressor of variegation 205 [Su(var)205], a gene implicated in the control of telomere length. Regulation by TP5, a structurally incomplete P element at the X telomere, is more profoundly impaired than regulation by TP6, a different incomplete P element inserted at the same site in a TAS repeat at the X telomere. Genetic analysis with the TP5 element indicates that its regulatory ability is not impaired in flies whose fathers came directly from a stock heterozygous for a Su(var)205 mutation, even when the flies themselves carry this mutation. However, it is impaired in flies whose grandfathers came from such a stock. Furthermore, this impairment occurs even when the Su(var)205 mutation is not present in the flies themselves or in their mothers. The impaired regulatory ability of TP5 persists for at least several generations after TP5 X chromosomes extracted from a long-term mutant Su(var)205 stock are made homozygous in the absence of the Su(var)205 mutation. Impairment of TP5-mediated regulation is therefore not directly dependent on the Su(var)205 mutation. However, it is characteristic of the six mutant Su(var)205 stocks that were tested and may be related to the elongated telomeres that develop in these stocks. Impairment of regulation by TP5 is also seen in a stock derived from Gaiano, a wild-type strain that has elongated telomeres due to a dominant mutation in the Telomere elongation (Tel) gene. Regulation by TP6 is not impaired in the Gaiano genetic background. The regulatory abilities of the TP5 and TP6 elements are therefore not equally susceptible to the effects of elongated telomeres in the mutant Su(var)205 and Gaiano stocks.",2005,"Kevin J Haley, Jeremy R Stuart, John D Raymond, Jarad B Niemi, Michael J Simmons, Kevin J Haley, Jeremy R Stuart, John D Raymond, Jarad B Niemi, Michael J Simmons"

Biochemical characterization of immunoprecipitated endogenous PDEs showed that PDE1 is a dual-specificity PDE (Michaelis constant Km for cGMP: 15.3+/-1 microM; Km cAMP: 20.5+/-1.5 microM), PDE6 is a cGMP-specific PDE (Km cGMP: 37+/-13 microM) and PDE11 is a dual-specificity PDE (Km cGMP: 6+/-2 microM; Km cAMP: 18.5+/-5.5 microM). Drosophila PDE1, PDE6 and PDE11 display sensitivity to vertebrate PDE inhibitors, zaprinast (IC50 was 71+/-39 microM for PDE1, 0.65+/-0.015 microM for PDE6 and 1.6+/-0.5 microM for PDE11) and sildenafil (IC50 was 1.3+/-0.9 microM for PDE1, 0.025+/-0.005 microM for PDE6 and 0.12+/-0.06 microM for PDE11).

"Role of HSF activation for resistance to heat, cold and high-temperature knock-down",16169555,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2005.08.002,"Regulation of heat shock proteins (Hsps) by the heat shock factor (HSF) and the importance of these proteins for resistance to heat stress is well documented. Less characterized is the importance of Hsps for cold stress resistance although Hsp70 is known to be induced following long-term cold exposure in Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, a temperature-sensitive HSF mutant line was used to investigate the role of HSF activation following heat hardening, rapid cold hardening (RCH) and long-term cold acclimation (LTCA) on heat and cold resistance, and this was correlated with Hsp70 expression. In addition, the effect of HSF activation on high-temperature knock-down resistance was evaluated. We found a significantly decreased HSF activation in the mutant line as compared to a corresponding control line following heat hardening, and this was correlated with decreased heat resistance of the mutant line. However, we did not find this difference in HSF activity to be important for resistance to cold stress or high-temperature knock-down. The findings indicate that induction of stress genes regulated by HSF, such as Hsps, although occurring following LTCA, are not of major importance for cold stress resistance and neither for RCH nor high-temperature knock-down resistance in D. melanogaster.",2005,"Morten Muhlig Nielsen, Johannes Overgaard, Jesper Givskov SÃ¸rensen, Martin Holmstrup, Just Justesen, Volker Loeschcke, Morten Muhlig Nielsen, Johannes Overgaard, Jesper Givskov SÃ¸rensen, Martin Holmstrup, Just Justesen, Volker Loeschcke"
Drosophila olfactory response rhythms require clock genes but not pigment dispersing factor or lateral neurons,15851530,10.1177/0748730405274451,"Odors elicit a number of behavioral responses, including attraction and repulsion in Drosophila. In this study, the authors used a T-maze apparatus to show that wild-type Drosophila melanogaster exhibit a robust circadian rhythm in the olfactory attractive and repulsive responses. These responses were lower during the day and began to rise at early night, peaking at about the middle of the night and then declining thereafter. They were also independent of locomotor activity. The olfactory response rhythms were lost in period or timeless mutant flies (per0, tim0), indicating that clock genes control circadian rhythms of olfactory behavior. The rhythms in olfactory response persisted in the absence of the pigment-dispersing factor neuropeptide or the central pacemaker lateral neurons known to drive circadian patterns of locomotion and eclosion. These results indicate that the circadian rhythms in olfactory behavior in Drosophila are driven by pacemakers that do not control the rest-activity cycle and are likely in the antennae.",2005,"Xianju Zhou, Chunyan Yuan, Aike Guo, Xianju Zhou, Chunyan Yuan, Aike Guo"

Two hypotheses were proposed to explain such a situation: a local sympatric differentiation or an allopatric divergence followed by a secondary contact. A microsatellite analysis, using markers on all chromosomes, strongly suggests that the Kronenbourg population has a European origin. Therefore, the allopatric divergence between Kronenbourg and Loua populations is probably responsible for the sexual isolation observed today in sympatry, after a recent introduction of a European propagule in Brazzaville.",2005,"W Haerty, M Lesbats, P Capy, W Haerty, M Lesbats, P Capy"
Evolutionary conservation of Ceratitis capitata transformer gene function,15998727,10.1534/genetics.105.041004,"Transformer functions as a binary switch gene in the sex determination and sexual differentiation of Drosophila melanogaster and Ceratitis capitata, two insect species that separated nearly 100 million years ago. The TRA protein is required for female differentiation of XX individuals, while XY individuals express smaller, presumably nonfunctional TRA peptides and consequently develop into adult males. In both species, tra confers female sexual identity through a well-conserved double-sex gene. However, unlike Drosophila tra, which is regulated by the upstream Sex-lethal gene, Ceratitis tra itself is likely to control a feedback loop that ensures the maintenance of the female sexual state. The putative CcTRA protein shares a very low degree of sequence identity with the TRA proteins from Drosophila species. However, in this study we show that a female-specific Ceratitis Cctra cDNA encoding the putative full-length CcTRA protein is able to support the female somatic and germline sexual differentiation of D. melanogaster XX; tra mutant adults. Although highly divergent, CcTRA can functionally substitute for DmTRA and induce the female-specific expression of both Dmdsx and Dmfru genes. These data demonstrate the unusual plasticity of the TRA protein that retains a conserved function despite the high evolutionary rate. We suggest that transformer plays an important role in providing a molecular basis for the variety of sex-determining systems seen among insects.",2005,"Attilio Pane, Annamaria De Simone, Giuseppe Saccone, Catello Polito, Attilio Pane, Annamaria De Simone, Giuseppe Saccone, Catello Polito"

The mosquito Anopheles gambiae is an emerging model organism for the study of innate immunity and host-pathogen interactions, where the malaria parasite induces a profound rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton at critical stages of infection. We have used bioinformatics tools to retrieve present sequence knowledge about the complete repertoire of cadherins in A. gambiae and compared it to that of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. In A. gambiae, we have identified 43 genes coding for cadherin extracellular domains that were re-annotated to 38 genes and represent an expansion of this gene family in comparison to other invertebrate organisms. The majority of Drosophila cadherins show a 1 : 1 Anopheles orthologue, but we have observed a remarkable expansion in some groups in A. gambiae, such as N-cadherins, that were recently shown to have a role in the olfactory system of the fruit fly.

Nutritional status affects 20-hydroxyecdysone concentration and progression of oogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,16214942,10.1677/joe.1.06220,"Drosophila egg production depends upon the nutritional available to females. When food is in short supply, oogenesis is arrested and apoptosis of the nurse cells is induced at mid-oogenesis via a mechanism that is probably controlled by ecdysteroid hormone. We have shown that expression of some ecdysone-response genes is correlated with apoptosis of egg chambers. Moreover, ecdysteroid injection and application of juvenile hormone induces and suppresses the apoptosis, respectively. In this study, we investigated which tissues show increases in the concentration of ecdysteroids under nutritional shortage to begin to link together nutrient intake, hormone regulation and the choice between egg development or apoptosis made within egg chambers. We measured ecdysteroid levels in the whole body, ovaries and haemolymph samples by RIA and found that the concentration of ecdysteroid increased in all samples. This contributes to the idea that nutritional shortage leads to a rapid high ecdysteroid concentration within the fly and that the high concentration induces apoptosis. Low concentrations of ecdysteroid are essential for normal oogenesis. We suggest there is threshold concentration in the egg chambers and that apoptosis at mid-oogenesis is induced when the ecdysteroid levels exceed the threshold. Starvation causes the ovary to retain the ecdysteroid it produces, thus enabling individual egg chambers to undergo apoptosis and thus control the number of eggs produced in relation to food intake.",2005,"J Terashima, K Takaki, S Sakurai, M Bownes, J Terashima, K Takaki, S Sakurai, M Bownes"

Role of Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signaling in the wound healing and regeneration of a Drosophila melanogaster wing imaginal disc,15968584,10.1387/ijdb.052006jm,"When a fragment of a Drosophila imaginal disc is cultured in growth permissive conditions, it either regenerates the missing structures or duplicates the pattern present in the fragment. This kind of pattern regulation is known to be epimorphic, i.e. the new pattern is generated by proliferation in a specialized tissue called the blastema. Pattern regulation is accompanied by the healing of the cut surfaces restoring the continuous epithelia. Wound healing has been considered to be the inductive signal to commence regenerative cell divisions. Although the general outlines of the proliferation dynamics in a regenerating imaginal disc blastema have been well studied, little is known about the mechanisms driving cells into the regenerative cell cycles. In this study, we have investigated the role of Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signaling in the wound healing and regeneration of a Drosophila wing imaginal disc. By utilizing in vivo and in vitro culturing of incised and fragmented discs, we have been able to visualize the dynamics in cellular architecture and gene expression involved in the healing and regeneration process. Our results directly show that homotypic wound healing is not a prerequisite for regenerative cell divisions. We also show that JNK signaling participates in imaginal disc wound healing and is regulated by the physical dynamics of the process, as well as in recruiting cells into the regenerative cell cycles.

Transposable element orientation bias in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,16315105,10.1007/s00239-004-0243-0,"Nonrandom distributions of transposable elements can be generated by a variety of genomic features. Using the full D. melanogaster genome as a model, we characterize the orientations of different classes of transposable elements in relation to the directionality of genes. DNA-mediated transposable elements are more likely to be in the same orientation as neighboring genes when they occur in the nontranscribed region's that flank genes. However, RNA-mediated transposable elements located in an intron are more often oriented in the direction opposite to that of the host gene. These orientation biases are strongest for genes with highly biased codon usage, probably reflecting the ability of such loci to respond to weak positive or negative selection. The leading hypothesis for selection against transposable elements in the coding orientation proposes that transcription termination poly(A) signal motifs within retroelements interfere with normal gene transcription. However, after accounting for differences in base composition between the strands, we find no evidence for global selection against spurious transcription termination signals in introns. We therefore conclude that premature termination of host gene transcription due to the presence of poly(A) signal motifs in retroelements might only partially explain strand-specific detrimental effects in the D. melanogaster genome.",2005,"Asher D Cutter, Jeffrey M Good, Christopher T Pappas, Matthew A Saunders, Dean M Starrett, Travis J Wheeler, Asher D Cutter, Jeffrey M Good, Christopher T Pappas, Matthew A Saunders, Dean M Starrett, Travis J Wheeler"
Three distinct chromatin domains in telomere ends of polytene chromosomes in Drosophila melanogaster Tel mutants,16278293,10.1242/jcs.02654,"Drosophila melanogaster telomeric DNA is known to comprise two domains: the terminal tract of retrotransposons (HeT-A, TART and TAHRE) and telomere-associated sequences (TAS). Chromosome tips are capped by a protein complex, which is assembled on the chromosome ends independently of the underlying terminal DNA sequences. To investigate the properties of these domains in salivary gland polytene chromosomes, we made use of Tel mutants. Telomeres in this background are elongated owing to the amplification of a block of terminal retroelements. Supercompact heterochromatin is absent from the telomeres of polytene chromosomes: electron microscopy analysis identifies the telomeric cap and the tract of retroelements as a reticular material, having no discernible banding pattern, whereas TAS repeats appear as faint bands. According to the pattern of bound proteins, the cap, tract of retroelements and TAS constitute distinct and non-overlapping domains in telomeres. SUUR, HP2, SU(VAR)3-7 and H3Me3K27 localize to the cap region, as has been demonstrated for HP1. All these proteins are also found in pericentric heterochromatin. The tract of retroelements is associated with proteins characteristic for both heterochromatin (H3Me3K9) and euchromatin (H3Me3K4, JIL-1, Z4). The TAS region is enriched for H3Me3K27. PC and E(Z) are detected both in TAS and many intercalary heterochromatin regions. Telomeres complete replication earlier than heterochromatic regions.

      Repeated elements such as satellites and transposons are ubiquitous in eukaryotic genomes. De novo computational identification and classification of such elements is a challenging problem. Therefore, repeat annotation of sequenced genomes has historically largely relied on sequence similarity to hand-curated libraries of known repeat families. We present a new approach to de novo repeat annotation that exploits characteristic patterns of local alignments induced by certain classes of repeats. We describe PILER, a package of efficient search algorithms for identifying such patterns. Novel repeats found using PILER are reported for Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thalania and Drosophila melanogaster.

The decreased life span occurs with signs of accelerated aging, such as osteoporosis, reduction in body weight, atrophy of organs, decreased stress resistance, and depletion of hematopoietic stem cells. These observations suggest a role for p53 in the determination of life span and the speculation that decreasing p53 activity may result in positive effects on some aging phenotypes . In this report, we show that expression of dominant-negative versions of Drosophila melanogaster p53 in adult neurons extends life span and increases genotoxic stress resistance in the fly. Consistent with this, a naturally occurring allele with decreased p53 activity has been associated with extended survival in humans . Expression of the dominant-negative Drosophila melanogaster p53 constructs does not further increase the extended life span of flies that are calorie restricted, suggesting that a decrease in p53 activity may mediate a component of the calorie-restriction life span-extending pathway in flies.",2005,"Johannes H Bauer, Peter C Poon, Heather Glatt-Deeley, John M Abrams, Stephen L Helfand, Johannes H Bauer, Peter C Poon, Heather Glatt-Deeley, John M Abrams, Stephen L Helfand"

Genotoxicity of industrial solid waste leachates in Drosophila melanogaster,16114001,10.1002/em.20149,"The potential toxicity of industrial solid wastes is a major environmental concern.

Leachates prepared at pH 7.0 were significantly less genotoxic than leachates prepared at pH 4.93 or 2.88. A comparison of the comet parameters among the exposed groups indicated that leachates of the pigment plant solid waste produced the least DNA damage, while leachates prepared from the flashlight battery factory solid waste were the most genotoxic.

High affinity transport of taurine by the Drosophila aspartate transporter dEAAT2,15611131,10.1074/jbc.M412440200,"Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) are structurally related plasma membrane proteins known to mediate the Na(+)/K(+)-dependent uptake of the amino acids l-glutamate and dl-aspartate. In the nervous system, these proteins contribute to the clearance of glutamate from the synaptic cleft and maintain excitatory amino acid concentrations below excitotoxic levels. Two homologues exist in Drosophila melanogaster, dEAAT1 and dEAAT2, which are specifically expressed in the nervous tissue. We previously reported that dEAAT2 shows unique substrate discrimination as it mediates high affinity transport of aspartate but not glutamate. We now show that dEAAT2 can also transport the amino acid taurine with high affinity, a property that is not shared by two other transporters of the same family, Drosophila dEAAT1 and human hEAAT2. Taurine transport by dEAAT2 was efficiently blocked by an EAAT antagonist but not by inhibitors of the structurally unrelated mammalian taurine transporters. Taurine and aspartate are transported with similar K(m) and relative efficacy and behave as mutually competitive inhibitors. dEAAT2 can mediate either net uptake or the heteroexchange of its two substrates, both being dependent on the presence of Na(+) ions in the external medium. Interestingly, heteroexchange only occurs in one preferred substrate orientation, i.e. with taurine transported inwards and aspartate outwards, suggesting a mechanism of transinhibition of aspartate uptake by intracellular taurine. Therefore, dEAAT2 is actually an aspartate/taurine transporter.

Menin is a regulator of the stress response in Drosophila melanogaster,16260610,10.1128/MCB.25.22.9960-9972.2005,"Menin, the product of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type I gene, has been implicated in several biological processes, including the control of gene expression and apoptosis, the modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, and DNA damage sensing or repair. In this study, we have investigated the function of menin in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. We show that Drosophila lines overexpressing menin or an RNA interference for this gene develop normally but are impaired in their response to several stresses, including heat shock, hypoxia, hyperosmolarity and oxidative stress. In the embryo subjected to heat shock, this impairment was characterized by a high degree of developmental arrest and lethality. The overexpression of menin enhanced the expression of HSP70 in embryos and interfered with its down-regulation during recovery at the normal temperature. In contrast, the inhibition of menin with RNA interference reduced the induction of HSP70 and blocked the activation of HSP23 upon heat shock, Menin was recruited to the Hsp70 promoter upon heat shock and menin overexpression stimulated the activity of this promoter in embryos. A 70-kDa inducible form of menin was expressed in response to heat shock, indicating that menin is also regulated in conditions of stress. The induction of HSP70 and HSP23 was markedly reduced or absent in mutant embryos harboring a deletion of the menin gene. These embryos, which did not express the heat shock-inducible form of menin, were also hypersensitive to various conditions of stress.

Faster development does not lead to correlated evolution of greater pre-adult competitive ability in Drosophila melanogaster,17148136,10.1098/rsbl.2004.0261,"In comparisons across Drosophila species, faster pre-adult development is phenotypically correlated with increased pre-adult competitive ability, suggesting that these two traits may also be evolutionary correlates of one another. However, correlations between traits within- and among- species can differ, and in most cases it is the within-species genetic correlations that are likely to act as constraints on adaptive evolution. Moreover, laboratory studies on Drosophila melanogaster have shown that the suite of traits that evolves in populations subjected to selection for faster development is the opposite of the traits that evolve in populations selected for increased pre-adult competitive ability. This observation led us to propose that, despite having a higher carrying capacity and a reduced minimum food requirement for completing development than controls, D. melanogaster populations subjected to selection for faster development should have lower competitive ability than controls owing to their reduced larval feeding rates and urea tolerance.

The role of the flabellar and ellipsoid bodies of the central complex of the brain of Drosophila melanogaster in the control of courtship behavior and communicative sound production in males,16433070,10.1007/s11055-005-0118-x,"The role of flabellar and ellipsoid bodies of the central complex of the brain of Drosophila melanogaster males in controlling courtship behavior and the accompanying sound production was studied by comparative analysis of the characteristics of courtship and singing in wild-type flies and individuals of five mutant lines with different anatomical defects in these parts of the brain. Investigations were performed using the following fly lines: Canton S (wild-type, controls), ebo(KS263), with defects only in the ellipsoid bodies, and ebo(1041), ceb(849), ceb(892), and cba(KS96), with different levels of abnormality in both parts of the central complex. The data obtained here indicated that the flabellar and ellipsoid bodies are involved in: 1) maintaining a high level of courtship activity; 2) regulating the precision of male movements while following females; 3) in controlling the nature and stability of the sound elements from which communicative signals are constructed; 4) in regulating the rhythmic structure of signals dependent on the stability of pacemakers function; 5) establishing the relationship between behavior and the context in which it occurs.",2005,"A V Popov, A I Peresleni, P V Ozerskii, E E Shchekanov, E V Savvateeva-Popova, A V Popov, A I Peresleni, P V Ozerskii, E E Shchekanov, E V Savvateeva-Popova"
The Drosophila melanogaster condensin subunit Cap-G interacts with the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CID,15592865,10.1007/s00412-004-0322-4,"The centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A plays a crucial role in kinetochore specification and assembly. We chose a genetic approach to identify interactors of the Drosophila CENP-A homolog CID. Overexpression of cid in the proliferating eye imaginal disk results in a rough eye phenotype, which is dependent on the ability of the overexpressed protein to localize to the kinetochore. A screen for modifiers of the rough eye phenotype identified mutations in the Drosophila condensin subunit gene Cap-G as interactors. Yeast two-hybrid experiments also reveal an interaction between CID and Cap-G. While chromosome condensation in Cap-G mutant embryos appears largely unaffected, massive defects in sister chromatid segregation occur during mitosis.

Whole-genome analysis reveals a strong positional bias of conserved dMyc-dependent E-boxes,15831447,10.1128/MCB.25.9.3401-3410.2005,"Myc is a transcription factor with diverse biological effects ranging from the control of cellular proliferation and growth to the induction of apoptosis. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional targets of the sole Myc ortholog in Drosophila melanogaster, dMyc. We show that the genes that are down-regulated in response to dmyc inhibition are largely identical to those that are up-regulated after dMyc overexpression and that many of them play a role in growth control. The promoter regions of these targets are characterized by the presence of the E-box sequence CACGTG, a known dMyc binding site. Surprisingly, a large subgroup of (functionally related) dMyc targets contains a single E-box located within the first 100 nucleotides after the transcription start site. The relevance of this E-box and its position was confirmed by a mutational analysis of a selected dMyc target and by the observation of its evolutionary conservation in a different Drosophila species, Drosophila pseudoobscura.

Conserved genomic organisation of Group B Sox genes in insects,15943880,10.1186/1471-2156-6-26,"Background:
      
    

    
      Sox domain containing genes are important metazoan transcriptional regulators implicated in a wide rage of developmental processes. The vertebrate B subgroup contains the Sox1, Sox2 and Sox3 genes that have early functions in neural development. Previous studies show that Drosophila Group B genes have been functionally conserved since they play essential roles in early neural specification and mutations in the Drosophila Dichaete and SoxN genes can be rescued with mammalian Sox genes. Despite their importance, the extent and organisation of the Group B family in Drosophila has not been fully characterised, an important step in using Drosophila to examine conserved aspects of Group B Sox gene function.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We have used the directed cDNA sequencing along with the output from the publicly-available genome sequencing projects to examine the structure of Group B Sox domain genes in Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura, Anopheles gambiae and Apis mellifora. All of the insect genomes contain four genes encoding Group B proteins, two of which are intronless, as is the case with vertebrate group B genes. As has been previously reported and unusually for Group B genes, two of the insect group B genes, Sox21a and Sox21b, contain introns within their DNA-binding domains. We find that the highly unusual multi-exon structure of the Sox21b gene is common to the insects. In addition, we find that three of the group B Sox genes are organised in a linked cluster in the insect genomes. By in situ hybridisation we show that the pattern of expression of each of the four group B genes during embryogenesis is conserved between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The DNA-binding domain sequences and genomic organisation of the group B genes have been conserved over 300 My of evolution since the last common ancestor of the Hymenoptera and the Diptera. Our analysis suggests insects have two Group B1 genes, SoxN and Dichaete, and two Group B2 genes. The genomic organisation of Dichaete and another two Group B genes in a cluster, suggests they may be under concerted regulatory control. Our analysis suggests a simple model for the evolution of group B Sox genes in insects that differs from the proposed evolution of vertebrate Group B genes.",2005,"Carol McKimmie, Gertrud Woerfel, Steven Russell, Carol McKimmie, Gertrud Woerfel, Steven Russell"
cis-regulatory logic of short-range transcriptional repression in Drosophila melanogaster,15831448,10.1128/MCB.25.9.3411-3420.2005,"Bioinformatics analysis of transcriptional control is guided by knowledge of the characteristics of cis-regulatory regions or enhancers. Features such as clustering of binding sites and co-occurrence of binding sites have aided enhancer identification, but quantitative predictions of enhancer function are not yet generally feasible. To facilitate the analysis of regulatory sequences in Drosophila melanogaster, we identified quantitative parameters that affect the activity of short-range transcriptional repressors, proteins that play key roles in development. In addition to the previously noted distance dependence, repression is strongly influenced by the stoichiometry, affinity, spacing, and arrangement of activator binding sites. Repression is insensitive to the type of activation domain, suggesting that short-range repression may primarily affect activators at the level of DNA binding. The activity of several short-range, but not long-range, repressors is circumscribed by the same quantitative parameters. This cis-regulatory ""grammar"" may aid the identification of enhancers regulated by short-range repressors and facilitate bioinformatic prediction of the functional output of transcriptional regulatory sequences.",2005,"Meghana M Kulkarni, David N Arnosti, Meghana M Kulkarni, David N Arnosti"
Olfactory coding in Drosophila larvae investigated by cross-adaptation,16155221,10.1242/jeb.01810,"In order to reveal aspects of olfactory coding, the effects of sensory adaptation on the olfactory responses of first-instar Drosophila melanogaster larvae were tested. Larvae were pre-stimulated with a homologous series of acetic esters (C3-C9), and their responses to each of these odours were then measured. The overall patterns suggested that methyl acetate has no specific pathway but was detected by all the sensory pathways studied here, that butyl and pentyl acetate tended to have similar effects to each other and that hexyl acetate was processed separately from the other odours. In a number of cases, cross-adaptation transformed a control attractive response into a repulsive response; in no case was an increase in attractiveness observed. This was investigated by studying changes in dose-response curves following pre-stimulation. These findings are discussed in light of the possible intra- and intercellular mechanisms of adaptation and the advantage of altered sensitivity for the larva.",2005,"Jennefer Boyle, Matthew Cobb, Jennefer Boyle, Matthew Cobb"
Reconstitution in vitro of the GDP-fucose biosynthetic pathways of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster,16650000,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2006.05239.x,"The deoxyhexose sugar fucose has an important fine-tuning role in regulating the functions of glycoconjugates in disease and development in mammals. The two genetic model organisms Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster also express a range of fucosylated glycans, and the nematode particularly has a number of novel forms. For the synthesis of such glycans, the formation of GDP-fucose, which is generated from GDP-mannose in three steps catalysed by two enzymes, is required. By homology we have identified and cloned cDNAs encoding these two proteins, GDP-mannose dehydratase (GMD; EC 4.2.1.47) and GDP-keto-6-deoxymannose 3,5-epimerase/4-reductase (GER or FX protein; EC 1.1.1.271), from both Caenorhabditis and Drosophila. Whereas the nematode has two genes encoding forms of GMD (gmd-1 and gmd-2) and one GER-encoding gene (ger-1), the insect has, like mammalian species, only one homologue of each (gmd and gmer). This compares to the presence of two forms of both enzymes in Arabidopsis thaliana. All corresponding cDNAs from Caenorhabditis and Drosophila, as well as the previously uncharacterized Arabidopsis GER2, were separately expressed, and the encoded proteins found to have the predicted activity.

Phylogeny of the sex-determining gene Sex-lethal in insects,16604108,10.1139/g05-107,"The Sex-lethal (SXL) protein belongs to the family of RNA-binding proteins and is involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. SXL has undergone an obvious change of function during the evolution of the insect clade. The gene has acquired a pivotal role in the sex-determining pathway of Drosophila, although it does not act as a sex determiner in non-drosophilids. We collected SXL sequences of insect species ranging from the pea aphid (Acyrtho siphom pisum) to Drosophila melanogaster by searching published articles, sequencing cDNAs, and exploiting homology searches in public EST and whole-genome databases. The SXL protein has moderately conserved N- and C-terminal regions and a well-conserved central region including 2 RNA recognition motifs. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that a single orthologue of the Drosophila Sex-lethal (Sxl) gene is present in the genomes of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, the honeybee Apis mellifera, the silkworm Bombyx mori, and the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. The D. melanogaster, D. erecta, and D. pseudoobscura genomes, however, contain 2 paralogous genes, Sxl and CG3056, which are orthologous to the Anopheles, Apis, Bombyx, and Tribolium Sxl. Hence, a duplication in the fly clade generated Sxl and CG3056. Our hypothesis maintains that one of the genes, Sxl, adopted the new function of sex determiner in Drosophila, whereas the other, CG3056, continued to serve some or all of the yet-unknown ancestral functions.",2006,"Walther Traut, Teruyuki Niimi, Kazuho Ikeo, Ken Sahara, Walther Traut, Teruyuki Niimi, Kazuho Ikeo, Ken Sahara"
Dissection of larval CNS in Drosophila melanogaster,18704179,10.3791/85,"The central nervous system (CNS) of Drosophila larvae is complex and poorly understood. One way to investigate the CNS is to use immunohistochemistry to examine the expression of various novel and marker proteins. Staining of whole larvae is impractical because the tough cuticle prevents antibodies from penetrating inside the body cavity. In order to stain these tissues it is necessary to dissect the animal prior to fixing and staining. In this article we demonstrate how to dissect Drosophila larvae without damaging the CNS. Begin by tearing the larva in half with a pair of fine forceps, and then turn the cuticle ""inside-out"" to expose the CNS. If the dissection is performed carefully the CNS will remain attached to the cuticle. We usually keep the CNS attached to the cuticle throughout the fixation and staining steps, and only completely remove the CNS from the cuticle just prior to mounting the samples on glass slides. We also show some representative images of a larval CNS stained with Eve, a transcription factor expressed in a subset of neurons in the CNS. The article concludes with a discussion of some of the practical uses of this technique and the potential difficulties that may arise.",2006,"Nathaniel Hafer, Paul Schedl, Nathaniel Hafer, Paul Schedl"
The bHLH transcription factor Hand is regulated by Alk in the Drosophila embryonic gut,17094947,10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.10.117,"During embryonic development the midgut visceral muscle is formed by fusion of cells within the visceral mesoderm, a process initiated by the specification of a specialised cell type, the founder cell, within this tissue. Activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk) in the developing visceral muscle of Drosophila melanogaster initiates a signal transduction pathway required for muscle fusion. In this paper, we have investigated downstream components which are regulated by this novel signalling pathway. Here we show that Alk-mediated signal transduction drives the expression of the bHLH transcription factor Hand in vivo. Loss of Alk function results in a complete lack of Hand expression in this tissue, whereas Alk gain of function results in an expansion of Hand expression. Finally, we have investigated the process of muscle fusion in the gut of Hand mutant animals and can find no obvious defects in this process, suggesting that Hand is not critical for visceral muscle fusion per se.",2006,"Gaurav K Varshney, Ruth H Palmer, Gaurav K Varshney, Ruth H Palmer"
"Evidence for structural constraint on ovulin, a rapidly evolving Drosophila melanogaster seminal protein",17130459,10.1073/pnas.0601849103,"The egg-laying hormone ovulin (Acp26Aa) is among the most rapidly evolving proteins in the Drosophila genome. Against the background of ovulin's high sequence variability within and between species, we have identified highly conserved motifs that may play an important structural role.

The C terminus of ovulin is necessary and sufficient for self-interaction, with its C-terminal 45 aa playing a major role. Under nonreducing conditions, ovulin participates in a high-molecular-mass complex, suggesting that it occurs in an oligomeric form. One or more of three predicted coiled-coil domains in the C terminus of ovulin may be involved in its self-interaction. These structural elements are conserved between species despite an overall rapid pace of evolution in ovulin's primary sequence. We therefore suggest that domains involved in ovulin's self-interaction form a conserved structural backbone for the protein, resulting in greater evolutionary flexibility at other sites.",2006,"Alex Wong, Shannon N Albright, Mariana F Wolfner, Alex Wong, Shannon N Albright, Mariana F Wolfner"

We investigated if the pattern of DNA sequence polymorphism in a region surrounding one of these loci can be explained by a hitchhiking event. We found strong evidence that the studied region around the gene unc-119 was shaped by a recent selective sweep, including a valley of reduced heterozygosity of 83.4 kb, a skew in the frequency spectrum, and significant linkage disequilibrium on one side of the valley.

To better understand the function of Drosophila SAGA (dSAGA), we sought to affinity purify and characterize this complex in more detail. A proteomic approach led to the identification of an orthologue of the yeast protein Ada1 and the novel protein encoded by CG4448, referred to as WDA (will decrease acetylation).

Retained introns are the least conserved, alternative acceptor sites are slightly more conserved than donor sites, and mutually exclusive exons are almost as conserved as constitutive exons. Cassette and mutually exclusive exons experience almost no intron insertions. We also observed cases of interconversion of various elementary alternatives, e.g., transformation of cassette exons into alternative sites.

A Drosophila model of Barth syndrome,16855048,10.1073/pnas.0603242103,"Barth syndrome is an X-linked disease presenting with cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle weakness. It is caused by mutations in tafazzin, a putative acyl transferase that has been associated with altered metabolism of the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin. To investigate the molecular basis of Barth syndrome, we created Drosophila melanogaster mutants, resulting from imprecise excision of a P element inserted upstream of the coding region of the tafazzin gene. Homozygous flies for that mutation were unable to express the full-length isoform of tafazzin, as documented by RNA and Western blot analysis, but two shorter tafazzin transcripts were still present, although the expression levels of their encoded proteins were too low to be detectable by Western blotting. The tafazzin mutation caused an 80% reduction of cardiolipin and a diversification of its molecular composition, similar to the changes seen in Barth patients. Other phospholipids, like phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, were not affected. Flies with the tafazzin mutation showed a reduced locomotor activity, measured in flying and climbing assays, and their indirect flight muscles displayed frequent mitochondrial abnormalities, mostly in the cristae membranes. Thus, tafazzin mutations in Drosophila generated a Barth-related phenotype, with the triad of abnormal cardiolipin, pathologic mitochondria, and motor weakness, suggesting causal links between these findings.

PCR testing of subsequent generations revealed that females retaining Spiroplasma infection continued to produce a large excess of female progeny, while females that had lost Spiroplasma produced offspring with normal sex ratios. Consistent with earlier work, we find that male-killing and transmission efficiency appear to increase with female age, and we note that males born in sex ratio broods display much lower survivorship than their female siblings.

"Intron size, abundance, and distribution within untranslated regions of genes",16980575,10.1093/molbev/msl111,"Most research concerning the evolution of introns has largely considered introns within coding sequences (CDSs), without regard for introns located within untranslated regions (UTRs) of genes. Here, we directly determined intron size, abundance, and distribution in UTRs of genes using full-length cDNA libraries and complete genome sequences for four species, Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, human, and mouse. Overall intron occupancy (introns/exon kbp) is lower in 5' UTRs than CDSs, but intron density (intron occupancy in regions containing introns) tends to be higher in 5' UTRs than in CDSs. Introns in 5' UTRs are roughly twice as large as introns in CDSs, and there is a sharp drop in intron size at the 5' UTR-CDS boundary. We propose a mechanistic explanation for the existence of selection for larger intron size in 5' UTRs, and outline several implications of this hypothesis. We found introns to be randomly distributed within 5' UTRs, so long as a minimum required exon size was assumed. Introns in 3' UTRs were much less abundant than in 5' UTRs. Though this was expected for human and mouse that have intron-dependent nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathways that discourage the presence of introns within the 3' UTR, it was also true for A. thaliana and D. melanogaster, which may lack intron-dependent NMD.

Drosophila in the study of neurodegenerative disease,17015234,10.1016/j.neuron.2006.09.025,"As populations benefit from increasing lifespans, neurodegenerative diseases have emerged as a critical health concern. How can the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, contribute to curing human diseases of the nervous system? A growing number of neurodegenerative diseases, as well as other human diseases, are being modeled in Drosophila and used as a platform to identify and validate cellular pathways that contribute to neurodegeneration and to identify promising therapeutic targets by using a variety of approaches from screens to target validation. The unique properties and tools available in the Drosophila system, coupled with the fact that testing in vivo has proven highly productive, have accelerated the progress of testing therapeutic strategies in mice and, ultimately, humans.

Protective effects of a mixture of antioxidant vitamins and minerals on the genotoxicity of doxorubicin in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,16010670,10.1002/em.20160,"Antioxidant vitamins are able to deactivate highly bioactive molecules, such as free radicals, that are generated during cellular biochemical processes. Doxorubicin (DXR) is a cancer chemotherapeutic agent that generates free radicals as a byproduct. In the present study, the Drosophila melanogaster somatic wing spot test was used to evaluate the effects of a mixture of vitamins (Vitamins C, E, and beta-carotene) and minerals (copper, selenium, and zinc), commercially known as Vitergan Zinc Plus, on the genotoxicity of DXR in standard and high-bioactivation crosses of flies. 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/ml of the vitamin/mineral mixture by itself was nongenotoxic in the trans-heterozygous descendants of both crosses, while the mixture produced a significant reduction in the genotoxicity produced by 0.125 mg/ml DXR in the trans-heterozygous descendants of both crosses. The protective effect was observed when the larvae received either pre- or cotreatments of the multivitamin/mineral (MV) mixture. The results indicate that, under these experimental conditions, the MV mixture is not genotoxic; however, it protects against the genotoxic effects of the chemotherapeutic free-radical generator DXR.",2006,"Wender Ferreira Costa, JÃºlio CÃ©sar Nepomuceno, Wender Ferreira Costa, JÃºlio CÃ©sar Nepomuceno"
The large isoform of Drosophila melanogaster heterochromatin protein 2 plays a critical role in gene silencing and chromosome structure,16980400,10.1534/genetics.106.057604,"Drosophila melanogaster heterochromatin protein 2 (HP2) interacts with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). In polytene chromosomes, HP2 and HP1 colocalize at the chromocenter, telomeres, and the small fourth chromosome. We show here that HP2 is present in the arms as well as the centromeric regions of mitotic chromosomes. We also demonstrate that Su(var)2-HP2 exhibits a dosage-dependent modification of variegation of a yellow reporter transgene, indicating a structural role in heterochromatin formation. We have isolated and characterized 14 new mutations in the Su(var)2-HP2 gene. Using wm4h, many (but not all) mutant alleles show dominant Su(var) activity. Su(var)2-HP2 mutant larvae show a wide variety of mitotic abnormalities, but not the telomere fusion seen in larvae deficient for HP1. The Su(var)2-HP2 gene codes for two isoforms: HP2-L (approximately 365 kDa) and HP2-S (approximately 175 kDa), lacking exons 5 and 6. In general, mutations that affect only the larger isoform result in more pronounced defects than do mutations common to both isoforms. This suggests that an imbalance between large and small isoforms is particularly deleterious. These results indicate a role for HP2 in the structural organization of chromosomes and in heterochromatin-induced gene silencing and show that the larger isoform plays a critical role in these processes.",2006,"Christopher D Shaffer, Giovanni Cenci, Brandi Thompson, Gena E Stephens, Elizabeth E Slawson, Kwame Adu-Wusu, Maurizio Gatti, Sarah C R Elgin, Christopher D Shaffer, Giovanni Cenci, Brandi Thompson, Gena E Stephens, Elizabeth E Slawson, Kwame Adu-Wusu, Maurizio Gatti, Sarah C R Elgin"

"Cloning, high yield over-expression, purification, and characterization of CG18594, a new PEBP/RKIP family member from Drosophila melanogaster",16529946,10.1016/j.pep.2006.01.020,"The phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) family is widely distributed in various species, from bacteria to mammals. These proteins seem to modulate important cell mechanisms: they control heterotrimeric G-proteins, inhibit the MAP-kinase and NFkappaB signaling pathways, and also serine proteases (thrombin, neuropsin, and chymotrypsin). In order to establish structure-function relationships for this family of proteins, our study focuses on PEBPs expressed within a single organism: Drosophila melanogaster, which constitutes a model system that lends itself well to establishing links between genes' expression and the corresponding proteins' functions, and to studying physiological mechanisms such as development. Here, we describe an optimized protocol for high level over-expression and high yield/high purity production of CG18594, one of Drosophila six putative PEBPs, for biophysical studies. The yield of the purified 15N labeled protein is estimated to be 60 mg/L of M9 minimal medium. Analysis of the secondary structure using circular dichroism indicates that the protein comprises mainly beta-sheets at pH 7. The good dispersion of the crosspeaks on the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum provides evidence of a proper folding of the purified protein, though its time evolution suggests a tendency to denature.

The Drosophila melanogaster LEM-domain protein MAN1,16439308,10.1016/j.ejcb.2005.10.002,"Here we describe the Drosophila melanogaster LEM-domain protein encoded by the annotated gene CG3167 which is the putative ortholog to vertebrate MAN1. MAN1 of Drosophila (dMAN1) and vertebrates have the following properties in common. Firstly, both molecules are integral membrane proteins of the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and share the same structural organization comprising an N-terminally located LEM motif, two transmembrane domains in the middle of the molecule, and a conserved RNA recognition motif in the C-terminal region. Secondly, dMAN1 has similar targeting domains as it has been reported for the human protein. Thirdly, immunoprecipitations with dMAN1-specific antibodies revealed that this Drosophila LEM-domain protein is contained in protein complexes together with lamins Dm0 and C. It has been previously shown that human MAN1 binds to A- and B-type lamins in vitro. During embryogenesis and early larval development LEM-domain proteins dMAN1 and otefin show the same expression pattern and are much more abundant in eggs and the first larval instar than in later larval stages and young pupae whereas the LEM-domain protein Bocksbeutel is uniformly expressed in all developmental stages. dMAN1 is detectable in the nuclear envelope of embryonic cells including the pole cells. In mitotic cells of embryos at metaphase and anaphase, LEM-domain proteins dMAN1, otefin and Bocksbeutel were predominantly localized in the region of the two spindle poles whereas the lamin B receptor and lamin Dm0 were more homogeneously distributed. Downregulation of dMAN1 by RNA interference (RNAi) in Drosophila cultured Kc167 cells has no obvious effect on nuclear architecture, viability of RNAi-treated cells and the intracellular distribution of the LEM-domain proteins Bocksbeutel and otefin. In contrast, the localization of dMAN1, Bocksbeutel and otefin at the INM is supported by lamin Dm0. We conclude that the dMAN1 protein is not a limiting component of the nuclear architecture in Drosophila cultured cells.",2006,"Nicole Wagner, Birgit Kagermeier, Silke Loserth, Georg Krohne, Nicole Wagner, Birgit Kagermeier, Silke Loserth, Georg Krohne"

The results clearly suggest that genetic ablation of LN(v)s and loss of function mutation of PDF abolish eclosion and locomotor activity rhythms, whereas the egg-laying rhythm continues unabated. Furthermore, the results also demonstrate that the period of egg-laying rhythm remains unchanged under different ambient temperatures and nutrition levels, suggesting that the egg-laying rhythm of D. melanogaster is temperature and nutrition compensated.

Chromosomal evolution of elements B and C in the Sophophora subgenus of Drosophila: evolutionary rate and polymorphism,16739458,,"The locations of 77 markers along the chromosomal elements B (41 markers) and C (36 markers) of Drosophila subobscura, D. pseudoobscura, and D. melanogaster were obtained by in situ hybridization on polytene chromosomes. In comparisons between D. subobscura and D. pseudoobscura, 10 conserved segments (accounting for 32% of the chromosomal length) were detected on element B and eight (17% of the chromosomal length) on element C. The fixation rate of paracentric inversions inferred by a maximum likelihood approach differs significantly between elements. Muller's element C (0.17 breakpoints/Mb/million years) is evolving two times faster than element B (0.08 breakpoints/Mb/million years). This difference in the evolutionary rate is paralleled by differences in the extent of chromosomal polymorphism in the corresponding lineages. Element C is highly polymorphic in D. subobscura, D. pseudoobscura, and in other obscura group species such as D. obscura and D. athabasca. In contrast, the level of polymorphism in element B is much lower in these species. The fixation rates of paracentric inversions estimated in the present study between species of the Sophophora subgenus are the highest estimates so far reported in the genus for the autosomes. At the subgenus level, there is also a parallelism between the high fixation rate and the classical observation that the species of the Sophophora subgenus tend to be more polymorphic than the species of the Drosophila subgenus. Therefore, the detected relationship between level of polymorphism and evolutionary rate might be a general characteristic of chromosomal evolution in the genus Drosophila.",2006,"Montserrat Papaceit, Montserrat AguadÃ©, Carmen Segarra, Montserrat Papaceit, Montserrat AguadÃ©, Carmen Segarra"
The ultrastructure of the kinetochore and kinetochore fiber in Drosophila somatic cells,16909258,10.1007/s00412-006-0076-2,"Drosophila melanogaster is a widely used model organism for the molecular dissection of mitosis in animals. However, despite the popularity of this system, no studies have been published on the ultrastructure of Drosophila kinetochores and kinetochore fibers (K-fibers) in somatic cells. To amend this situation, we used correlative light (LM) and electron microscopy (EM) to study kinetochores in cultured Drosophila S2 cells during metaphase, and after colchicine treatment to depolymerize all microtubules (MTs). We find that the structure of attached kinetochores in S2 cells is indistinct, consisting of an amorphous inner zone associated with a more electron-dense peripheral surface layer that is approximately 40-50 nm thick. On average, each S2 kinetochore binds 11+/-2 MTs, in contrast to the 4-6 MTs per kinetochore reported for Drosophila spermatocytes. Importantly, nearly all of the kinetochore MT plus ends terminate in the peripheral surface layer, which we argue is analogous to the outer plate in vertebrate kinetochores.

Recombineering allows gap repair and mutagenesis in bacteria. Gap repair efficiently retrieves DNA fragments up to 133 kilobases long from P1 or BAC clones.

Taking advantage of the existence of polytene chromosomes in the salivary glands of third instar larvae, we analyzed K9 and K14 H3 acetylation patterns in situ after UV irradiation of wild-type and Dmp53 null flies. As in human cells, after UV damage there is an increase in H3 acetylation in wild-type organisms. In Dmp53 mutant flies, this response is significantly affected at the K9 position. These results are similar to those found in human p53 mutant tumor cells with one interesting difference, only the basal H3 acetylation of K14 is reduced in Dmp53 mutant flies, while the basal H3-K9 acetylation is not affected. This work shows, that the presence of Dmp53 is necessary to maintain normal H3-K14 acetylation levels in Drosophila chromatin and that the function of p53 to maintaining histone modifications, is conserved in Drosophila and humans.",2006,"Eria Rebollar, Viviana Valadez-Graham, Martha VÃ¡zquez, Enrique Reynaud, Mario Zurita, Eria Rebollar, Viviana Valadez-Graham, Martha VÃ¡zquez, Enrique Reynaud, Mario Zurita"
Three-dimensional organization of Drosophila melanogaster interphase nuclei. I.

The results are based primarily on three-dimensional reconstructions from unfixed tissues using a computer-based data collection and modeling system. A characteristic organization of chromosomes in each cell type is observed, independent of polyteny, with some packing motifs common to several or all tissues and others tissue-specific. All chromosomes display a right-handed coiling chirality, despite large differences in size and degree of coiling. Conversely, in each cell type, the heterochromatic centromeric regions have a unique structure, tendency to associate, and intranuclear location. The organization of condensed nucleolar chromatin is also tissue-specific. The tightly coiled prothoracic gland chromosomes are arrayed in a similar fashion to the much larger salivary gland chromosomes described previously, having polarized orientations, nonintertwined spatial domains, and close packing of the arms of each autosome, whereas hindgut and especially the unusually straight midgut chromosomes display striking departures from these regularities. Surprisingly, gut chromosomes often appear to be broken in the centric heterochromatin. Severe deformations of midgut nuclei observed during gut contractions in living larvae may account for their unusual properties. Finally, morphometric measurements of chromosome and nuclear dimensions provide insights into chromosome growth and substructure and also suggest an unexpected parallel with diploid chromatin organization.",1987,"M Hochstrasser, J W Sedat, M Hochstrasser, J W Sedat"

We have used Drosophila tissue culture cells in an in vivo transient expression assay to delimit cis-acting sequences affecting Adh expression, and to investigate the role of chromatin structure in Adh gene regulation. These studies show that positive cis-acting elements of the distal promoter can exist in at least 2 alternative chromatin configurations. There is a close correlation between specific transcriptional activity of the Adh distal promoter and a defined, localized chromatin structural change that indicates altered DNA-protein interactions. Thus, chromatin structure appears to play a role in regulating the accessibility of defined positive cis-acting regulatory sequences of Adh to transcription factors and the transcription machinery.",1987,"C Benyajati, S Ayer, J McKeon, A Ewel, J Huang, C Benyajati, S Ayer, J McKeon, A Ewel, J Huang"

To elucidate the evolutionary relationship between these two genes, and hence facilitate comparative analyses, it is necessary to determine the number of msh-like genes in the two species, and to characterize any msh gene duplication events which may have occurred since their divergence. To address these questions, I have employed the polymerase chain reaction to amplify, clone and sequence msh-related homeobox genes from two divergent vertebrate species (mouse and zebrafish), one ascidian (Ciona intestinalis), and D. melanogaster. Sequence determination of 91 recombinant clones resulted in the identification of three msh-like genes from mouse and three from zebrafish, but only one each from C. intestinalis and D. melanogaster.

"abnormal chromatin (abc), a maternal-effect locus in Drosophila melanogaster",1905300,,"Mutations in the maternal-effect gene abnormal chromatin (abc) in Drosophila melanogaster result in a variety of defects involving nuclear replication/division. Three recessive alleles of this gene, which maps near 51F on chromosome 2, all result in female sterility. They cause slower embryonic development that is usually abnormal from the earliest nuclear divisions and arrested by the sixth one. Nuclei tend to be large and erratically distributed, some intensely staining. Mitotic asynchrony is common. Few embryos reach the gastrula stage and none hatch. With the weakest allele, fsPL, bridges between nuclei are common; abnormal chromatin clumps that resemble yolk nuclei occur before the other nuclei reach the surface; and spindle anomalies and DNA wads with numerous centrosomes are seen. Females with the stronger alleles, fsA5 and fs27, lay fewer eggs and a smaller proportion of embryos reach blastoderm; developmental arrest occurs earlier, usually with several large nuclei distributed along the length of the embryo. Chorion defects occur in all three mutants. Mitotic asynchrony, nuclear bridging, endoreduplication and nuclear behavior aberrant from the first division suggest that the abc gene product operates in DNA replication/nuclear division. Larval (homozygous F1) neuroblast chromosome structure and mitotic indices are normal, indicating that any mitotic function is strictly maternal, i.e. abc is not a general mitotic gene.

Purified Ape protein lacks the 3'-exonuclease activity against undamaged DNA that is found in the bacterial and Drosophila enzymes, but the lack of obvious amino acid changes to account for this difference suggests that the various enzyme functions evolved by fine tuning a conserved active site.

A 2.9-kb tandemly duplicated sequence of w+ within a w+ gene is responsible for the white-ivory phenotype. Reversion of wi to w+ is, in general, associated with the loss of the appended 2.9 kb or other alterations affecting this duplicated region. The appearance of light (white or nearly white) phenotypes could be due to the loss of some wi copies. Thus, in the eyes of adult males resulting from treated larvae, we can detect 2 types of sectors (red and light) on the orange-yellow background. Our results indicate that the genetic system used in this somatic assay is sensitive to the genotoxic effects of the 4 compounds tested. All 4 compounds tested were positive.

"Response to heat shock of gene 1, a Drosophila melanogaster small heat shock gene, is developmentally regulated",1903835,10.1007/BF00260651,"The expression of gene 1, a member of the small heat shock gene family from the Drosophila melanogaster chromosomal locus 67B was studied. In contrast to the other heat shock genes, the response of gene 1 to stress was modulated during development. In the absence of stress, gene 1 was expressed at the beginning of pupation, and at a very low level in adult males. Expression of gene 1 was substantially increased by heat shock in pupae, but was one to two orders of magnitude lower in adults or in embryos. Under the same conditions, hsp70 or hsp26 were induced to similar levels in all stages. This developmental effect could be mimicked in cultured Drosophila cells: expression of gene 1 was stimulated by heat shock in the presence, but not in the absence, of the moulting hormone ecdysterone, while the level of expression of hsp26 and hsp70 in response to heat shock was independent of the presence of the hormone. Thus, the presence and activity of the heat shock transcription factor are not sufficient for the maximal response of gene 1 to stress. These results suggest that the heat shock activator protein requires additional factors, which are developmentally regulated, to activate transcription of gene 1. Furthermore, S1 nuclease mapping analysis revealed several gene 1 mRNA species, which are generated by the use of alternative polyadenylation sites and by the use of differentially regulated transcriptional initiation sites.",1991,"J Vazquez, J Vazquez"
Genotoxicity testing with the somatic white-ivory system in the eye of Drosophila melanogaster,1903508,10.1016/0165-7992(91)90031-x,"The white-ivory test in Drosophila melanogaster is designed to detect chemically induced reversions of the sex-linked, recessive unstable eye-color mutation white-ivory to the wild-type form. After exposure of larvae reversions are detectable as clones of red facets in the eye of newly enclosed adult flies. Tester strains containing a quadruplication of the white-ivory gene on the X-chromosome(s) were used. In a strain with males carrying 4 copies of the gene and females carrying 8 copies of the gene, spontaneous reversions occurred proportional to the gene copy number. In contrast to this, chemically induced reversions occurred only 1.36 times more frequently in females (carrying 8 copies of the gene) than in males (carrying 4 copies). Since chemicals inducing different lesions in DNA (bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, daunomycin, diethyl sulfate and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene) did induce statistically significant frequencies of reversions the test appears to be capable of detecting a wide variety of genotoxic chemicals with different modes of action.

In vitro processing of Drosophila melanogaster 5 S ribosomal RNA. 3' end effects and requirement for internal domains of mature 5 S RNA,1902221,,"5 S RNA processing in Drosophila melanogaster, the removal of 15 nucleotides from the 3' end of the 135-nucleotide (nt) primary transcript, may play an important role in the regulation of 5 S RNA transport and ribosome assembly. We have uncoupled processing from transcription using gel purified primary transcripts processed in vitro by a cellular S100 extract. The RNA was generated by a homologous transcription system or by a T7 RNA polymerase reaction using a constructed 5 S RNA gene linked to a T7 promoter. In vitro D. melanogaster 5 S RNA processing is heat- and EDTA-sensitive, suggesting a requirement for protein, and produces a 3' end characteristic of mature 5 S RNA. Processing of substrate RNAs with altered 3' ends shows that the 3'-U5 tail (nt 131-135) inhibits the reaction. 30 nt, including all of domain IV and most of domain V, are dispensible for processing, whereas deletions including the base of stem V and all or part of stem III severely inhibit it.

HERITABLE VARIATION IN ETHANOL TOLERANCE AND ITS ASSOCIATION WITH BIOCHEMICAL TRAITS IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,28564174,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1991.tb04378.x,"To help elucidate mechanisms of larval ethanol tolerance seven isochromosomal lines of Drosophila melanogaster with different second chromosomes were fed a growth-limiting concentration of ethanol (4.5% v/v) and examined for associations between growth traits and biochemical characteristics that had previously been implicated in the determination of tolerance variation. Repeated measures of survival and development time over four generations verified the inherited nature of these traits. Significant variation among the lines were evident for flux from ethanol into lipid, for activity levels of alcohol dehydrogenase and glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase (GPO), and for levels of long chain and unsaturated fatty acids. A high degree of positive association occurred among the variables. A partial correlation analysis controlling for performance of the lines on ethanol-free medium revealed a strong association between the degree of long chain fatty acid content and line survival when ethanol was fed. The correlation between GPO activity and survival in an ethanol environment appeared to depend on the association of GPO activity with long chain fatty acid content. The positive correlations of flux from ethanol into lipid with many of the other variables suggested that the ADH pathway influenced the level of ethanol tolerance. These associations are all consistent with the hypothesis that the lipid content of body tissues, especially the levels of long chain and unsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes, may have an important influence on both spatial and interspecific variation in the ethanol tolerance of larvae.",1991,"Billy W Geer, Stephen W McKechnie, Pieter W H Heinstra, Manfred J Pyka, Billy W Geer, Stephen W McKechnie, Pieter W H Heinstra, Manfred J Pyka"

"Elements of the fruitless locus regulate development of the muscle of Lawrence, a male-specific structure in the abdomen of Drosophila melanogaster adults",1821857,,"A genetically defined element of the fruitless (fru) locus in Drosophila melanogaster regulates the development of a male-specific muscle spanning the fifth abdominal segment in adult males, the 'muscle of Lawrence' (MOL). The region is defined by two cytological deletions, each with a breakpoint that co-maps with previously described mutant courtship phenotypes at cytogenetic interval 91B on the third chromosome. Flies that carry both of these deletions are viable, and males express abnormalities of courtship similar to those caused by the fru inversion breakpoint at 91B. In addition, these double-deletion males show the complete absence of the MOL, suggesting that they have little or no gene expression of a postulated MOL determinant; the musculature in the fifth abdominal segment of these mutants to indistinguishable from that of a normal female. Other mutant combinations that produce fruitless courtship phenotypes--including deletion and inversion breakpoints, and a marked transposon inserted at 91B--produce intermediate forms of the MOL. A new genetic variant, induced by imprecise excision of the marked transposon, is homozygous lethal and disrupts fru functions related to courtship and the MOL. The MOL is shown to be dispensable for fertility and is therefore not the causative factor of fru-induced behavioral sterility. These genetic variants and their phenotypic results are discussed with regard to a model for the organization of the fru locus.",1991,"D A Gailey, B J Taylor, J C Hall, D A Gailey, B J Taylor, J C Hall"
Effects of tannic acid on spontaneous and induced somatic mutations in Drosophila melanogaster,1908938,10.1093/mutage/6.3.225,"The effects of tannic acid (TA) alone and in combination with direct acting chemical genotoxins and gamma-radiation were investigated in Somatic Mutation and Recombination Tests (SMARTs) using Drosophila melanogaster. Treatment with TA alone (2.5-15 mmol/l) resulted in a moderate but dose dependent induction of mosaic spots in males and females, indicating that the compound possesses mutagenic and recombinogenic activity. When TA (10 mmol/l) was given simultaneously with MMS, 4-NQO and cis-DDP, a potentiating effect on their mutagenicity was observed in males whereas in females no such increase was measured. The frequency of 4-NQO induced mosaic spots in males was raised more than threefold in presence of TA, for MMS and cis-DDP the enhancement was approximately 2-fold; with gamma-radiation no synergistic effect occurred. The different response in the two sexes indicates that TA preferentially induces gene mutations and deletions but has no enhancing effect on the number of mosaic spots which are formed as a consequence of recombinogenic events.",1991,"A Szakmary, S KnasmÃ¼ller, A Szakmary, S KnasmÃ¼ller"
Search for a Drosophila-93D-like locus in Chironomus and Anopheles,1905218,,"The results of experiments to explore the possible existence of a heat shock locus in Chironomus and Anopheles which may be comparable to the 93D heat shock locus of Drosophila, are presented. None of the heat shock loci in C. striatipennis were inducible by benzamide, colchicine, vitamin B6, thiamphenicol or a homogenate of heat shocked glands, all of which are known to selectively induce the 93D-like loci in the genus Drosophila. Benzamide also failed to induce any locus in A. stephensi. The effect of all these treatments on general transcription in Chironomus and Anopheles polytene nuclei were comparable to those known in polytene cells of Drosophila. It thus appears that a heat shock locus homologous to 93D of D. melanogaster is absent in Chironomus and Anopheles so far as inducibility of a puff by specific agents is concerned. The existence of a possible 'functional counterpart' of the 93D locus in Chironomus and Anopheles genomes cannot be eliminated.",1991,"B B Nath, S C Lakhotia, B B Nath, S C Lakhotia"

Using the ZESTE genetic test system, we have shown that both chrysotile and amosite asbestos induce sex-chromosome aneuploidy in Drosophila oocytes. Chrysotile appeared to be the more effective agent because it induced approximately equal frequencies of chromosome gain and chromosome loss, while amosite induced chromosome loss only. Two other asbestiform minerals, crocidolite and tremolite, were ineffective in this assay system.

Molecular population genetics of the distal portion of the X chromosome in Drosophila: evidence for genetic hitchhiking of the yellow-achaete region,1664405,,"We have estimated DNA sequence variation and differentiation within and between Drosophila melanogaster and its sibling species, Drosophila simulans, using six-cutter restriction site variation at yellow-achaete (y-ac), phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Pgd), and period (per). These three gene regions are of varying distance from the telomere of the X chromosome and range from very low to moderate rates of recombination in D. melanogaster. According to Tajima's test of neutrality, the Pgd region has been influenced by balancing selection in D. melanogaster. This is consistent with previous data suggesting the allozyme polymorphism at this locus is visible to selection. The Hudson, Kreitman, AguadÃ© test of neutrality reveals a significant departure from neutrality for the y-ac region compared to the per or rosy regions in D. simulans. There is also a significant departure for the y-ac region compared to the Adh 5' flanking region in D. melanogaster. In both species the departure appears to be due to reduced variation at y-ac compared to that expected from divergence between D. simulans and D. melanogaster. We conclude that recent hitchhiking associated with the selective fixation of one or more advantageous mutants in the y-ac region is the best explanation for reduced variation at y-ac.",1991,"D J Begun, C F Aquadro"

Therefore, female-sterile mutations at the ecs locus are somatic line specific. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis revealed normal level of the yolk proteins in such females.

A voltage-dependent gap junction in Drosophila melanogaster,1901743,10.1016/S0006-3495(91)82204-4,"Steady-state and kinetic analyses of gap junctional conductance, gi, in salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster third instar larvae reveal a strong and complex voltage dependence that can be elicited by two types of voltages. Voltages applied between the cells, i.e., transjunctional voltages, Vj, and those applied between the cytoplasm and the extracellular space, inside-outside voltages, Vi,o, markedly alter gj. Alteration of Vi-o while holding Vj = O,i.e., by equal displacement of the voltages in the cells, causes gj to increase to a maximum on hyperpolarization and to decrease to near zero on depolarization. These conductance changes associated with Vi-o are fit by a model in which there are two independent gates in series, one in each series, one in each membrane, where each gate is equally sensitive to Vi-o and exhibits first order kinetics. Vj's generated by applying voltage steps of either polarity to either cell, substantially reduce gj. These conductance changes exhibit complex kinetics that depend on Vi-o as well as Vj. At more positive Vi-o's, the changes in gj have two phases, an early phase consisting of of a decrease in gj for either polarity of Vj and a later phase consisting of an increase in gj on hyperpolarizing either cell and a decrease on depolarizing either cell. At negative Vi-o's in the plateau region of the gj-Vi-o relation, the later slow increase in gj is absent on hyperpolarizing either cell. Also, the early decrease in gj for either polarity of Vj is faster the more positive the Vi-o. The complex time course elicited by applying voltage steps to one cell can be explained as combined actions of Vi-o and Vj, with the early phase ascribable to Vj, but influenced by Vi-o, and the later phase to the changes in Vi-o associated with the generation of Vj. The substantially different kinetics and sensitivity of changes in gj by Vi-o and Vj suggests that the mechanisms of gating by these two voltages are different. Evidently, these gap-junction channels are capable of two distinct, but interactive forms of voltage dependence.",1991,"V K Verselis, M V Bennett, T A Bargiello, V K Verselis, M V Bennett, T A Bargiello"
The influence of developmental stage on cold shock resistance and ability to cold-harden in Drosophila melanogaster,17234205,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2006.11.008,"Thermal sensitivity and ability to rapidly cold- and heat-harden may change during ontogeny. This study reports how inherent cold tolerance and ability to rapidly cold-harden change across eight developmental stages in both genders of Drosophila melanogaster using a similar experimental approach for all stages. Inherent cold tolerance was estimated as LT50 by assaying cold shock survival over a wide range of temperatures (-16 to 5 degrees C). Rapid cold-hardening (RCH) was applied by cooling from 25 to 0 degrees C at -0.25 degrees C min(-1) followed by 1 h at 0 degrees C. Individuals were cold shocked either directly or after RCH to estimate the effect of RCH. We found large variation in cold tolerance among developmental stages and minor differences between genders. Eggs were most tolerant followed by adults, pupae and larvae. In the light of this and other studies it is suggested that there is a general pattern of stage specific thermal stress resistance in Drosophila. The capacity to rapidly cold-harden was found in both sexes of larval, pupal and adult stages, though some developmental stages showed negative or neutral effects of RCH which was probably due to the cost associated with the hardening treatment in these cold susceptible stages. The early presence of RCH indicates that the mechanisms behind hardening are not stage specific and that RCH may be an ecologically important trait in early stages of ontogeny.",2007,"Dorthe Jensen, Johannes Overgaard, Jesper G SÃ¸rensen, Dorthe Jensen, Johannes Overgaard, Jesper G SÃ¸rensen"

Jagunal is required for reorganizing the endoplasmic reticulum during Drosophila oogenesis,17389229,10.1083/jcb.200701048,"Vesicular traffic in the Drosophila melanogaster oocyte occurs actively during vitellogenesis. Although endocytosis in the oocyte has been well characterized, exocytic vesicular traffic is less well understood. We show that the oocyte endoplasmic reticulum (ER) becomes concentrated into subcortical clusters during vitellogenesis. This ER reorganization requires Jagunal, which is an evolutionarily conserved ER membrane protein. Loss of Jagunal reduces vesicular traffic to the oocyte lateral membrane, but does not affect posterior polarized vesicular traffic, suggesting a role for Jagunal in facilitating vesicular traffic in the subcortex. Reduced membrane traffic caused by loss of Jagunal affects oocyte and bristle growth. We propose that ER reorganization is an important mechanism used by cells to prepare for an increased demand for membrane traffic, and Jagunal facilitates this process through ER clustering.",2007,"Sangil Lee, Lynn Cooley, Sangil Lee, Lynn Cooley"

Sex-specific DoublesexM expression in subsets of Drosophila somatic gonad cells,17935627,10.1186/1471-213X-7-113,"Background:
      
    

    
      In Drosophila melanogaster, a pre-mRNA splicing hierarchy controls sexual identity and ultimately leads to sex-specific Doublesex (DSX) transcription factor isoforms. The male-specific DSXM represses genes involved in female development and activates genes involved in male development. Spatial and temporal control of dsx during embryogenesis is not well documented.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here we show that DSX(M) is specifically expressed in subsets of male somatic gonad cells during embryogenesis. Following testis formation, germ cells remain in contact with DSX(M)-expressing cells, including hub cells and premeiotic somatic cyst cells that surround germ cells during spermatogenesis in larval and adult testes.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We show that dsx is transcriptionally regulated in addition to being regulated at the pre-mRNA splicing level by the sex determination hierarchy. The dsx locus is spatially controlled by somatic gonad identity. The continuous expression of DSX(M) in cells contacting the germline suggests an ongoing short-range influence of the somatic sex determination pathway on germ cell development.",2007,"Leonie U Hempel, Brian Oliver, Leonie U Hempel, Brian Oliver"
Oxygen reperfusion damage in an insect,18060061,10.1371/journal.pone.0001267,"The deleterious effects of anoxia followed by reperfusion with oxygen in higher animals including mammals are well known. A convenient and genetically well characterized small-animal model that exhibits reproducible, quantifiable oxygen reperfusion damage is currently lacking. Here we describe the dynamics of whole-organism metabolic recovery from anoxia in an insect, Drosophila melanogaster, and report that damage caused by oxygen reperfusion can be quantified in a novel but straightforward way. We monitored CO(2) emission (an index of mitochondrial activity) and water vapor output (an index of neuromuscular control of the spiracles, which are valves between the outside air and the insect's tracheal system) during entry into, and recovery from, rapid-onset anoxia exposure with durations ranging from 7.5 to 120 minutes. Anoxia caused a brief peak of CO(2) output followed by knock-out. Mitochondrial respiration ceased and the spiracle constrictor muscles relaxed, but then re-contracted, presumably powered by anaerobic processes. Reperfusion to sustained normoxia caused a bimodal re-activation of mitochondrial respiration, and in the case of the spiracle constrictor muscles, slow inactivation followed by re-activation. After long anoxia durations, both the bimodality of mitochondrial reactivation and the recovery of spiracular control were impaired. Repeated reperfusion followed by episodes of anoxia depressed mitochondrial respiratory flux rates and damaged the integrity of the spiracular control system in a dose-dependent fashion. This is the first time that physiological evidence of oxygen reperfusion damage has been described in an insect or any invertebrate. We suggest that some of the traditional approaches of insect respiratory biology, such as quantifying respiratory water loss, may facilitate using D. melanogaster as a convenient, well-characterized experimental model for studying the underlying biology and mechanisms of ischemia and reperfusion damage and its possible mitigation.",2007,"John R B Lighton, Pablo E Schilman, John R B Lighton, Pablo E Schilman"
"Conservation of epigenetic regulation, ORC binding and developmental timing of DNA replication origins in the genus Drosophila",18039868,10.1534/genetics.107.070862,"There is much interest in how DNA replication origins are regulated so that the genome is completely duplicated each cell division cycle and in how the division of cells is spatially and temporally integrated with development. In the Drosophila melanogaster ovary, the cell cycle of somatic follicle cells is modified at precise times in oogenesis. Follicle cells first proliferate via a canonical mitotic division cycle and then enter an endocycle, resulting in their polyploidization. They subsequently enter a specialized amplification phase during which only a few, select origins repeatedly initiate DNA replication, resulting in gene copy number increases at several loci important for eggshell synthesis. Here we investigate the importance of these modified cell cycles for oogenesis by determining whether they have been conserved in evolution. We find that their developmental timing has been strictly conserved among Drosophila species that have been separate for approximately 40 million years of evolution and provide evidence that additional gene loci may be amplified in some species. Further, we find that the acetylation of nucleosomes and Orc2 protein binding at active amplification origins is conserved. Conservation of DNA subsequences within amplification origins from the 12 recently sequenced Drosophila species genomes implicates members of a Myb protein complex in recruiting acetylases to the origin. Our findings suggest that conserved developmental mechanisms integrate egg chamber morphogenesis with cell cycle modifications and the epigenetic regulation of origins.",2007,"B R Calvi, B A Byrnes, A J Kolpakas, B R Calvi, B A Byrnes, A J Kolpakas"

Cell type-specific cDNA rescue and mosaic experiments showed that wnt5 functions in olfactory neurons. Mutation of the derailed (drl) gene, encoding a receptor for Wnt5, resulted in derangement of the glomerular map, ectopic midline glomeruli and the accumulation of Wnt5 at the midline. We show here that drl functions in glial cells, where it acts upstream of wnt5 to modulate its function in glomerular patterning.

A female-biased expressed elongase involved in long-chain hydrocarbon biosynthesis and courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,17360514,10.1073/pnas.0608142104,"Drosophila melanogaster produces sexually dimorphic cuticular pheromones that are a key component of the courtship behavior leading to copulation. These molecules are hydrocarbons, with lengths of 23 and 25 carbons in males (mainly with one double bond) and 27 and 29 carbons in females (mainly with two double bonds). Here, we describe an elongase gene, eloF, with female-biased expression. The 771-bp ORF encodes a 257-aa protein that shows the highest sequence identity with mouse SSC1 elongase (33%). The activity of the cDNA expressed in yeast was elongation of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids up to C30. RNAi knockdown in Drosophila led to a dramatic modification of female hydrocarbons, with decreased C29 dienes and increased C25 dienes accompanied by a modification of several courtship parameters: an increase in copulation latency and a decrease in both copulation attempts and copulation. Feminization of the hydrocarbon profile in males by using targeted expression of the transformer gene resulted in high expression levels of eloF, suggesting that the gene is under the control of the sex-determination hierarchy. There is no expression of eloF in Drosophila simulans, which synthesize only C23 and C25 hydrocarbons.

This protein was purified by DEAE ion-exchange and Superdex 75 gel filtration chromatography and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight analysis as the product of the TT01 gene plu1382 (NCBI accession number NC_005126); we refer to it here as PrtS. PrtS is a member of the M4 metalloprotease family. Injection of PrtS into larvae of M. sexta and Galleria mellonella and into adult Drosophila melanogaster and D. melanogaster melanization mutants (Bc) confirmed that the purified protein induced the melanization reaction. The prtS gene was transcribed by P. luminescens injected into M. sexta before death of the insect, suggesting that the protein was produced during infection. The exact function of this protease during infection is not clear. The bacteria might survive inside the insect despite the melanization process, or it might be that the bacterium is specifically activating melanization in an attempt to circumvent this innate immune response.",2007,"Kiara G Held, Christopher N LaRock, David A D'Argenio, Celeste A Berg, Carleen M Collins, Kiara G Held, Christopher N LaRock, David A D'Argenio, Celeste A Berg, Carleen M Collins"
Synthetic lethality of Drosophila in the absence of the MUS81 endonuclease and the DmBlm helicase is associated with elevated apoptosis,17603121,10.1534/genetics.106.070060,"Mus81-Mms4 (Mus81-Eme1 in some species) is a heterodimeric DNA structure-specific endonuclease that has been implicated in meiotic recombination and processing of damaged replication forks in fungi. We generated and characterized mutations in Drosophila melanogaster mus81 and mms4. Unlike the case in fungi, we did not find any role for MUS81-MMS4 in meiotic crossing over. A possible role for this endonuclease in repairing double-strand breaks that arise during DNA replication is suggested by the finding that mus81 and mms4 mutants are hypersensitive to camptothecin; however, these mutants are not hypersensitive to other agents that generate lesions that slow or block DNA replication. In fungi, mus81, mms4, and eme1 mutations are synthetically lethal with mutations in genes encoding RecQ helicase homologs. Similarly, we found that mutations in Drosophila mus81 and mms4 are synthetically lethal with null mutations in mus309, which encodes the ortholog of the Bloom Syndrome helicase. Synthetic lethality is associated with high levels of apoptosis in proliferating tissues. Lethality and elevated apoptosis were partially suppressed by a mutation in spn-A, which encodes the ortholog of the strand invasion protein Rad51. These findings provide insights into the causes of synthetic lethality.",2007,"Kirsten Trowbridge, Kim McKim, Steven J Brill, Jeff Sekelsky, Kirsten Trowbridge, Kim McKim, Steven J Brill, Jeff Sekelsky"
Compartmentalization of neuronal and peripheral serotonin synthesis in Drosophila melanogaster,17376153,10.1111/j.1601-183X.2007.00307.x,"In Drosophila, one enzyme (Drosophila tryptophan-phenylalanine hydroxylase, DTPHu) hydroxylates both tryptophan to yield 5-hydroxytryptophan, the first step in serotonin synthesis, and phenylalanine, to generate tyrosine. Analysis of the sequenced Drosophila genome identified an additional enzyme with extensive homology to mammalian tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), which we have termed DTRHn. We have shown that DTRHn can hydroxylate tryptophan in vitro but displays differential activity relative to DTPHu when using tryptophan as a substrate. Recent studies in mice identified the presence of two TPH genes, Tph1 and Tph2, from distinct genetic loci. Tph1 represents the non-neuronal TPH gene, and Tph2 is expressed exclusively in the brain. In this article, we show that DTRHn is neuronal in expression and function and thus represents the Drosophila homologue of Tph2. Using a DTRHn-null mutation, we show that diminished neuronal serotonin affects locomotor, olfactory and feeding behaviors, as well as heart rate. We also show that DTPHu functions in vivo as a phenylalanine hydroxylase in addition to its role as the peripheral TPH in Drosophila, and is critical for non-neuronal developmental events.",2007,"W S Neckameyer, C M Coleman, S Eadie, S F Goodwin, W S Neckameyer, C M Coleman, S Eadie, S F Goodwin"
"Nematodes, bacteria, and flies: a tripartite model for nematode parasitism",17475494,10.1016/j.cub.2007.04.027,"More than a quarter of the world's population is infected with nematode parasites, and more than a hundred species of nematodes are parasites of humans [1-3]. Despite extensive morbidity and mortality caused by nematode parasites, the biological mechanisms of host-parasite interactions are poorly understood, largely because of the lack of genetically tractable model systems. We have demonstrated that the insect parasitic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, its bacterial symbiont Photorhabdus luminescens, and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster constitute a tripartite model for nematode parasitism and parasitic infection. We find that infective juveniles (IJs) of Heterorhabditis, which contain Photorhabdus in their gut, can infect and kill Drosophila larvae. We show that infection activates an immune response in Drosophila that results in the temporally dynamic expression of a subset of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes, and that this immune response is induced specifically by Photorhabdus. We also investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying IJ recovery, the developmental process that occurs in parasitic nematodes upon host invasion and that is necessary for successful parasitism. We find that the chemosensory neurons and signaling pathways that control dauer recovery in Caenorhabditis elegans also control IJ recovery in Heterorhabditis, suggesting conservation of these developmental processes across free-living and parasitic nematodes.",2007,"Elissa A Hallem, Michelle Rengarajan, Todd A Ciche, Paul W Sternberg, Elissa A Hallem, Michelle Rengarajan, Todd A Ciche, Paul W Sternberg"
Large-scale discovery of promoter motifs in Drosophila melanogaster,17238282,10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030007,"A key step in understanding gene regulation is to identify the repertoire of transcription factor binding motifs (TFBMs) that form the building blocks of promoters and other regulatory elements. Identifying these experimentally is very laborious, and the number of TFBMs discovered remains relatively small, especially when compared with the hundreds of transcription factor genes predicted in metazoan genomes. We have used a recently developed statistical motif discovery approach, NestedMICA, to detect candidate TFBMs from a large set of Drosophila melanogaster promoter regions. Of the 120 motifs inferred in our initial analysis, 25 were statistically significant matches to previously reported motifs, while 87 appeared to be novel. Analysis of sequence conservation and motif positioning suggested that the great majority of these discovered motifs are predictive of functional elements in the genome. Many motifs showed associations with specific patterns of gene expression in the D. melanogaster embryo, and we were able to obtain confident annotation of expression patterns for 25 of our motifs, including eight of the novel motifs. The motifs are available through Tiffin, a new database of DNA sequence motifs. We have discovered many new motifs that are overrepresented in D. melanogaster promoter regions, and offer several independent lines of evidence that these are novel TFBMs. Our motif dictionary provides a solid foundation for further investigation of regulatory elements in Drosophila, and demonstrates techniques that should be applicable in other species. We suggest that further improvements in computational motif discovery should narrow the gap between the set of known motifs and the total number of transcription factors in metazoan genomes.",2007,"Thomas A Down, Casey M Bergman, Jing Su, Tim J P Hubbard, Thomas A Down, Casey M Bergman, Jing Su, Tim J P Hubbard"
NHK-1 phosphorylates BAF to allow karyosome formation in the Drosophila oocyte nucleus,18039935,10.1083/jcb.200706067,"Accurate chromosome segregation in meiosis requires dynamic changes in chromatin organization. In Drosophila melanogaster, upon completion of recombination, meiotic chromosomes form a single, compact cluster called the karyosome in an enlarged oocyte nucleus. This clustering is also found in humans; however, the mechanisms underlying karyosome formation are not understood. In this study, we report that phosphorylation of barrier to autointegration factor (BAF) by the conserved kinase nucleosomal histone kinase-1 (NHK-1; Drosophila Vrk1) has a critical function in karyosome formation. We find that the noncatalytic domain of NHK-1 is crucial for its kinase activity toward BAF, a protein that acts as a linker between chromatin and the nuclear envelope. A reduction of NHK-1 or expression of nonphosphorylatable BAF results in ectopic association of chromosomes with the nuclear envelope in oocytes. We propose that BAF phosphorylation by NHK-1 disrupts anchorage of chromosomes to the nuclear envelope, allowing karyosome formation in oocytes. These data provide the first mechanistic insight into how the karyosome forms.",2007,"Oscar M Lancaster, C Fiona Cullen, Hiroyuki Ohkura, Oscar M Lancaster, C Fiona Cullen, Hiroyuki Ohkura"
Protein kinase D regulates several aspects of development in Drosophila melanogaster,17592635,10.1186/1471-213X-7-74,"Background:
      
    

    
      Protein Kinase D (PKD) is an effector of diacylglycerol-regulated signaling pathways. Three isoforms are known in mammals that have been linked to diverse cellular functions including regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, motility and secretory transport from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane. In Drosophila, there is a single PKD orthologue, whose broad expression implicates a more general role in development.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We have employed tissue specific overexpression of various PKD variants as well as tissue specific RNAi, in order to investigate the function of the PKD gene in Drosophila. Apart from a wild type (WT), a kinase dead (kd) and constitutively active (SE) Drosophila PKD variant, we also analyzed two human isoforms hPKD2 and hPKD3 for their capacity to substitute PKD activity in the fly. Overexpression of either WT or kd-PKD variants affected primarily wing vein development. However, overexpression of SE-PKD and PKD RNAi was deleterious. We observed tissue loss, wing defects and degeneration of the retina. The latter phenotype conforms to a role of PKD in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. Strongest phenotypes were larval to pupal lethality. RNAi induced phenotypes could be rescued by a concurrent overexpression of Drosophila wild type PKD or either human isoform hPKD2 and hPKD3.

Functional studies of active-site mutants from Drosophila melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase. Investigations of the putative catalytic glutamate-arginine pair and of residues responsible for substrate specificity,17302737,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2007.05701.x,"The catalytic reaction mechanism and binding of substrates was investigated for the multisubstrate Drosophila melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase. Mutation of E52 to D, Q and H plus mutations of R105 to K and H were performed to investigate the proposed catalytic reaction mechanism, in which E52 acts as an initiating base and R105 is thought to stabilize the transition state of the reaction. Mutant enzymes (E52D, E52H and R105H) showed a markedly decreased k(cat), while the catalytic activity of E52Q and R105K was abolished. The E52D mutant was crystallized with its feedback inhibitor dTTP. The backbone conformation remained unchanged, and coordination between D52 and the dTTP-Mg complex was observed. The observed decrease in k(cat) for E52D was most likely due to an increased distance between the catalytic carboxyl group and 5'-OH of deoxythymidine (dThd) or deoxycytidine (dCyd). Mutation of Q81 to N and Y70 to W was carried out to investigate substrate binding. The mutations primarily affected the K(m) values, whereas the k(cat) values were of the same magnitude as for the wild-type. The Y70W mutation made the enzyme lose activity towards purines and negative cooperativity towards dThd and dCyd was observed. The Q81N mutation showed a 200- and 100-fold increase in K(m), whereas k(cat) was decreased five- and twofold for dThd and dCyd, respectively, supporting a role in substrate binding.

Efficient parameter estimation for spatio-temporal models of pattern formation: case study of Drosophila melanogaster,17893088,10.1093/bioinformatics/btm433,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Diffusable and non-diffusable gene products play a major role in body plan formation. A quantitative understanding of the spatio-temporal patterns formed in body plan formation, by using simulation models is an important addition to experimental observation. The inverse modelling approach consists of describing the body plan formation by a rule-based model, and fitting the model parameters to real observed data. In body plan formation, the data are usually obtained from fluorescent immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridizations. Inferring model parameters by comparing such data to those from simulation is a major computational bottleneck. An important aspect in this process is the choice of method used for parameter estimation. When no information on parameters is available, parameter estimation is mostly done by means of heuristic algorithms.

      We show that parameter estimation for pattern formation models can be efficiently performed using an evolution strategy (ES). As a case study we use a quantitative spatio-temporal model of the regulatory network for early development in Drosophila melanogaster. In order to estimate the parameters, the simulated results are compared to a time series of gene products involved in the network obtained with immunohistochemistry. We demonstrate that a (mu,lambda)-ES can be used to find good quality solutions in the parameter estimation. We also show that an ES with multiple populations is 5-140 times as fast as parallel simulated annealing for this case study, and that combining ES with a local search results in an efficient parameter estimation method.",2007,"Yves Fomekong-Nanfack, Jaap A Kaandorp, Joke Blom, Yves Fomekong-Nanfack, Jaap A Kaandorp, Joke Blom"
First evidence of methylation in the genome of Drosophila willistoni,17205375,10.1007/s10709-006-9116-3,"DNA methylation has been studied abundantly in vertebrates and recent evidence confirms that this phenomenon could be disseminated among some invertebrates groups, including Drosophila species. In this paper, we used the Methylation-Sensitive Restriction Endonuclease (MSRE) technique and Southern blot with specific probes, to detect methylation in the Drosophila willistoni species. We found differential cleavage patterns between males and females that cannot be explained by Mendelian inheritance, pointing to a DNA methylation phenomenon different from the Drosophila melanogaster one. The sequencing of some of these bands showed that these fragments were formed by different DNA elements, among which rDNA. We also characterized the D. willitoni dDnmt2 sequence, through a Mega Blast search against the D. willistoni Trace Archive Database using the D. melanogaster dDnmt2 nucleotide sequence as query. The complete analysis of D. willistoni dDnmt2 sequence showed that its promoter region is larger, its dDnmt2 nucleotide sequence is 33% divergent from the D. melanogaster one, Inverted Terminal Repeats (ITRs) are absent and only the B isoform of the enzyme is produced. In contrast, ORF2 is more conserved. Comparing the D. willistoni and D. melanogaster dDnmt2 protein sequences, we found higher conservation in motifs from the large domain, responsible for the catalysis of methyl transfer, and great variability in the region that carries out the recognition of specific DNA sequences (TRD). Globally, our results reveal that methylation of the D. willistoni genome could be involved in a singular process of species-specific dosage compensation and that the DNA methylation in the Drosophila genus can have diverse functions. This could be related to the evolutionary history of each species and also to the acquisition time of the dDnmt2 gene.",2007,"Rosane Nunes Garcia, MarÃ­cia Fantinel D'Avila, Lizandra Jaqueline Robe, Elgion LÃºcio da Silva Loreto, Yanina Panzera, Fabiana Oliveira de Heredia, Vera LÃºcia da Silva Valente"
Two independent duplications forming the Cyp307a genes in Drosophila,17785192,10.1016/j.ibmb.2007.05.017,"The conserved relationship between orthologs of many cytochrome P450 genes involved in ecdysone synthesis is not reflected in the evolution of the Drosophila Cyp307a genes. In Drosophila melanogaster Cyp307a1 (spook) and Cyp307a2 (spookier) both play essential roles in ecdysone synthesis and may possess biochemically redundant functions. Using phylogenetic analyses we show that the Drosophila Cyp307a genes were formed from two independent duplication events depicting a complicated evolutionary scenario. An initial duplication, from a Cyp307a2 ancestral gene produced the Cyp307a1 gene that has been maintained only in the Sophophoran subgenus. A second duplication in the Drosophila subgenus formed an additional paralog, Cyp307a3. Microsynteny is conserved for Cyp307a2 throughout the Drosophila species, but is not conserved between Cyp307a1 and Cyp307a3. These are located in different genomic positions in the Sophophora and Drosophila subgenera, respectively. Cyp307a3 appears to encode a functional gene product and is expressed in a different spatial and temporal manner to Cyp307a1.

Comparative genomic analysis of allatostatin-encoding (Ast) genes in Drosophila species and prediction of regulatory elements by phylogenetic footprinting,17175069,10.1016/j.peptides.2006.08.033,"The role of the YXFGLa family of allatostatin (AST) peptides in dipterans is not well-established. The recent completion of sequencing of genomes for multiple Drosophila species provides an opportunity to study the evolutionary variation of the allatostatins and to examine regulatory elements that control gene expression. We performed comparative analyses of Ast genes from seven Drosophila species (Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila simulans, Drosophila ananassae, Drosophila yakuba, Drosophila pseudoobscura, Drosophila mojavensis, and Drosophila grimshawi) and used phylogenetic footprinting methods to identify conserved noncoding motifs, which are candidates for regulatory regions. The peptides encoded by the Ast precursor are nearly identical across species with the exception of AST-1, in which the leading residue may be either methionine or valine. Phylogenetic footprinting predicts as few as 3, to as many as 17 potential regulatory sites depending on the parameters used during analysis. These include a Hunchback motif approximately 1.2 kb upstream of the open reading frame (ORF), overlapping motifs for two Broad-complex isoforms in the first intron, and a CF2-II motif located in the 3'-UTR.

The miRNA pathway intrinsically controls self-renewal of Drosophila germline stem cells,17320391,10.1016/j.cub.2007.01.060,"Stem cells uniquely self-renew and maintain tissue homoeostasis by differentiating into different cell types to replace aged or damaged cells [1]. During oogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster, self-renewal of germline stem cells (GSCs) requires both intrinsic signaling mechanisms and extrinsic signals from neighboring niche cells [2]. Emerging evidence suggests that microRNA (miRNA)-mediated translational regulation may also control Drosophila GSC self-renewal [3, 4]. It is unclear, however, whether the miRNA pathway functions within stem cells or niche cells to maintain GSCs. In Drosophila, Dicer-1 (Dcr-1) and the double-stranded RNA binding protein Loquacious (Loqs) catalyze miRNA biogenesis [3-5]. Here, we generate loqs knockout (loqs(KO)) flies by ends-out homologous recombination and show that loqs is essential for embryonic viability and ovarian GSC maintenance. Both developmental and miRNA processing defects are rescued by transgenic expression of Loqs-PB, but not Loqs-PA. Furthermore, mosaic germline analysis indicates that Loqs is required intrinsically for GSC maintenance. Consistently, GSCs are restored in loqs mutant ovaries by germline expression, but not somatic expression, of Loqs-PB. Together, these results demonstrate that Loqs-PB, but not Loqs-PA, is necessary and sufficient for Drosophila development and the miRNA pathway. Our study strongly suggests that miRNAs play an intrinsic, but not extrinsic, role in Drosophila female GSC self-renewal.",2007,"Joseph K Park, Xiang Liu, Tamara J Strauss, Dennis M McKearin, Qinghua Liu, Joseph K Park, Xiang Liu, Tamara J Strauss, Dennis M McKearin, Qinghua Liu"

Identification of unannotated exons of low abundance transcripts in Drosophila melanogaster and cloning of a new serine protease gene upregulated upon injury,17650329,10.1186/1471-2164-8-249,"Background:
      
    

    
      The sequencing of the D.melanogaster genome revealed an unexpected small number of genes (~ 14,000) indicating that mechanisms acting on generation of transcript diversity must have played a major role in the evolution of complex metazoans. Among the most extensively used mechanisms that accounts for this diversity is alternative splicing. It is estimated that over 40% of Drosophila protein-coding genes contain one or more alternative exons. A recent transcription map of the Drosophila embryogenesis indicates that 30% of the transcribed regions are unannotated, and that 1/3 of this is estimated as missed or alternative exons of previously characterized protein-coding genes. Therefore, the identification of the variety of expressed transcripts depends on experimental data for its final validation and is continuously being performed using different approaches. We applied the Open Reading Frame Expressed Sequence Tags (ORESTES) methodology, which is capable of generating cDNA data from the central portion of rare transcripts, in order to investigate the presence of hitherto unnanotated regions of Drosophila transcriptome.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Bioinformatic analysis of 1,303 Drosophila ORESTES clusters identified 68 sequences derived from unannotated regions in the current Drosophila genome version (4.3). Of these, a set of 38 was analysed by polyA+ northern blot hybridization, validating 17 (50%) new exons of low abundance transcripts. For one of these ESTs, we obtained the cDNA encompassing the complete coding sequence of a new serine protease, named SP212. The SP212 gene is part of a serine protease gene cluster located in the chromosome region 88A12-B1. This cluster includes the predicted genes CG9631, CG9649 and CG31326, which were previously identified as up-regulated after immune challenges in genomic-scale microarray analysis. In agreement with the proposal that this locus is co-regulated in response to microorganisms infection, we show here that SP212 is also up-regulated upon injury.

By using regulatory elements of the nanos and vasa genes, we established endogenous sources of the phiC31 integrase, eliminating the difficulties of coinjecting integrase mRNA and raising the transformation efficiency. Moreover, to discriminate between specific and rare nonspecific integration events, a white gene-based reconstitution system was generated that enables visual selection for precise attP targeting. Finally, we demonstrate that our chromosomal attP sites can be modified in situ, extending their scope while retaining their properties as landing sites.

The D. melanogaster population from the Caucasus displayed heterogeneity in the genotypes of this cytoplasmic infection. The Wolbachia genotype wMel, detected in all the populations studied, was the most abundant. The genotype wMelCS2 was always present in the populations from Middle Asia and Altai and was among the rare variants in the D. melanogaster populations from the Eastern Europe.

The dynamics of the roo transposable element in mutation-accumulation lines and segregating populations of Drosophila melanogaster,17890368,10.1534/genetics.107.076174,"We estimated the number of copies for the long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposable element roo in a set of long-standing Drosophila melanogaster mutation-accumulation full-sib lines and in two large laboratory populations maintained with effective population size approximately 500, all of them derived from the same isogenic origin. Estimates were based on real-time quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization. Considering previous estimates of roo copy numbers obtained at earlier stages of the experiment, the results imply a strong acceleration of the insertion rate in the accumulation lines. The detected acceleration is consistent with a model where only one (maybe a few) of the approximately 70 roo copies in the ancestral isogenic genome was active and each active copy caused new insertions with a relatively high rate ( approximately 10(-2)), with new inserts being active copies themselves. In the two laboratory populations, however, a stabilized copy number or no accelerated insertion was found. Our estimate of the average deleterious viability effects per accumulated insert [E(s) < 0.003] is too small to account for the latter finding, and we discuss the mechanisms that could contain copy number.",2007,"Montserrat Papaceit, Victoria Avila, Montserrat AguadÃ©, Aurora GarcÃ­a-Dorado, Montserrat Papaceit, Victoria Avila, Montserrat AguadÃ©, Aurora GarcÃ­a-Dorado"

This review focuses on what is known of the neuronal and molecular substrates for thermosensation across species, focusing on the three robust model systems extensively used to study sensory signaling, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the laboratory mouse. Nematodes migrate to thermal climes that are amenable to their survival, a behavior that is regulated primarily through a single sensory neuron. Additionally, nematodes ""learn"" to seek out this temperate zone based upon their prior experience, a robust model of learning and memory. Drosophila larvae also prefer select thermal zones that are optimal for growth and have also developed vigorous mechanisms to avoid unfavorable conditions. In mammals, the transduction mechanisms for thermosensation have been identified primarily due to the fact that naturally occurring plant products evoke distinct psychophysical sensation of temperature change. More remarkably, the elucidation of the molecular sensors in mammals, along with those in Drosophila, has demonstrated conservation in the molecular mediators of temperature sensation across diverse species.",2007,"David D McKemy, David D McKemy"

We have extensively analyzed the function of mjl and examined its functional divergence from the parental gene sgg in Drosophila melanogaster. Unlike Sgg, which is expressed in many tissues of both sexes, Mjl is expressed specifically in the male germ line, where it is required for male germ line survival. Our analysis indicates that mjl has acquired a specific function in the maintenance of male germ line viability. However, it has not completely lost its ancestral biochemical function and can partially compensate for loss of the parental gene sgg when ectopically expressed in somatic cells.

Drosophila Blimp-1 is a transient transcriptional repressor that controls timing of the ecdysone-induced developmental pathway,17923694,10.1128/MCB.01304-07,"Regulatory mechanisms controlling the timing of developmental events are crucial for proper development to occur. ftz-f1 is expressed in a temporally regulated manner following pulses of ecdysteroid and this precise expression is necessary for the development of Drosophila melanogaster. To understand how insect hormone ecdysteroids regulate the timing of FTZ-F1 expression, we purified a DNA binding regulator of ftz-f1. Mass spectroscopy analysis revealed this protein to be a fly homolog of mammalian B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1). Drosophila Blimp-1 (dBlimp-1) is induced directly by 20-hydroxyecdysone, and its product exists during high-ecdysteroid periods and turns over rapidly. Forced expression of dBlimp-1 and RNA interference analysis indicate that dBlimp-1 acts as a repressor and controls the timing of FTZ-F1 expression. Furthermore, its prolonged expression results in delay of pupation timing. These results suggest that the transient transcriptional repressor dBlimp-1 is important for determining developmental timing in the ecdysone-induced pathway.",2007,"Yasuo Agawa, Moustafa Sarhan, Yuji Kageyama, Kazutaka Akagi, Masayoshi Takai, Kazuya Hashiyama, Tadashi Wada, Hiroshi Handa, Akihiro Iwamatsu, Susumu Hirose, Hitoshi Ueda, Yasuo Agawa, Moustafa Sarhan, Yuji Kageyama, Kazutaka Akagi, Masayoshi Takai, Kazuya Hashiyama, Tadashi Wada, Hiroshi Handa, Akihiro Iwamatsu, Susumu Hirose, Hitoshi Ueda"

Virgin flies eclosing from the normal and contaminated food were pair-mated to examine the effect of the test chemicals on reproduction of the exposed organisms. Expression of hsp70, sex peptide (SP or Acp70A), accessory gland protein (Acp36DE) and tissue damage was examined in reproductive organs of adult fly. Exposed organisms exhibited a dose-dependent significantly reduced reproductive outcome and males were found to be more sensitive than females. Hsp70 expression was restricted only within the testis lobes of male fly while it was not induced in the ovary of the female. In concurrence with absence of hsp70 expression in the accessory glands of male fly, tissue damage was evident in them. Acp70A and Acp36DE expression were found to be significantly downregulated at the higher concentrations of the test chemicals. The study suggests that (i) dichlorvos is more deleterious to fly reproduction compared to chlorpyrifos with an adverse effect on Acp70A and Acp36DE expression required to facilitate normal reproduction; (ii) hsp70 may be used as a marker of cellular damage against dichlorvos and chlorpyrifos in Drosophila.",2007,"Subash C Gupta, Hifzur R Siddique, Neeraj Mathur, Ranjit K Mishra, Kalyan Mitra, Daya K Saxena, Debapratim K Chowdhuri, Subash C Gupta, Hifzur R Siddique, Neeraj Mathur, Ranjit K Mishra, Kalyan Mitra, Daya K Saxena, Debapratim K Chowdhuri"

Evolution and potential function of fibrinogen-like domains across twelve Drosophila species,18513432,10.1186/1471-2164-9-260,"Background:
      
    

    
      The fibrinogen-like (FBG) domain consists of approximately 200 amino acid residues, which has high sequence similarity to the C-terminal halves of fibrinogen beta and gamma chains. Fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs) containing one or more FBG domains are found universally in vertebrates and invertebrates. In invertebrates, FREPs are involved in immune responses and other aspects of physiology. To understand the complexity of this gene family in Drosophila, we analyzed FREPs in twelve Drosophila species.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Using the genome data from 12 Drosophila species, we identified FBG domains in each species. The results show that the gene numbers in each species vary from 14 genes up to 43 genes. Using sequence profile analysis, we found that FBG domains have high sequence similarity and are highly conserved throughout. By comparison of structure and sequence conservation, some of the FBG domains in Drosophila melanogaster are predicted to function in recognition of carbohydrates and their derivatives on the surface of microorganisms in innate immunity.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:

Gene expression variation in African and European populations of Drosophila melanogaster,18208589,10.1186/gb-2008-9-1-r12,"Background:
      
    

    
      Differences in levels of gene expression among individuals are an important source of phenotypic variation within populations. Recent microarray studies have revealed that expression variation is abundant in many species, including Drosophila melanogaster. However, previous expression surveys in this species generally focused on a small number of laboratory strains established from derived populations. Thus, these studies were not ideal for population genetic analyses.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We surveyed gene expression variation in adult males of 16 D. melanogaster strains from two natural populations, including an ancestral African population and a derived European population. Levels of expression polymorphism were nearly equal in the two populations, but a higher number of differences was detected when comparing strains between populations. Expression variation was greatest for genes associated with few molecular functions or biological processes, as well as those expressed predominantly in males. Our analysis also identified genes that differed in expression level between the European and African populations, which may be candidates for adaptive regulatory evolution. Genes involved in flight musculature and fatty acid metabolism were over-represented in the list of candidates.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Overall, stabilizing selection appears to be the major force governing gene expression variation within populations. However, positive selection may be responsible for much of the between-population expression divergence. The nature of the genes identified to differ in expression between populations may reveal which traits were important for local adaptation to the European and African environments.",2008,"Stephan Hutter, Sarah S Saminadin-Peter, Wolfgang Stephan, John Parsch, Stephan Hutter, Sarah S Saminadin-Peter, Wolfgang Stephan, John Parsch"
Extraembryonic development in insects and the acrobatics of blastokinesis,18082679,10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.11.004,"Extraembryonic development is familiar to mouse researchers, but the term is largely unknown among insect developmental geneticists. This is not surprising, as the model system Drosophila melanogaster has an extremely reduced extraembryonic component, the amnioserosa. In contrast, most insects retain the ancestral complement of two distinct extraembryonic membranes, amnion and serosa. These membranes are involved in several key morphogenetic events at specific developmental stages. The events of anatrepsis and katatrepsis--collectively referred to as blastokinesis--are specific to hemimetabolous insects. Corresponding events in holometabolous insects are simplified and lack formal names. All insects retain dorsal closure, which has been well studied in Drosophila. This review aims to resurrect both the terminology and awareness of insect extraembryonic development--which were last common currency in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries--as a number of recent studies have identified essential components of these events, through RNA interference of developmental genes and ectopic hormonal treatments. As much remains unknown, this topic offers opportunities for research on tissue specification, the regulation of cell shape changes and tissue interactions during morphogenesis, tracing the origins and final fates of cell and tissue lineages, and ascertaining the membranes' functions between morphogenetic events.",2008,"Kristen A Panfilio, Kristen A Panfilio"
Genomic analysis of adaptive differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster,18493064,10.1534/genetics.107.083659,"Drosophila melanogaster shows clinal variation along latitudinal transects on multiple continents for several phenotypes, allozyme variants, sequence variants, and chromosome inversions. Previous investigation suggests that many such clines are due to spatially varying selection rather than demographic history, but the genomic extent of such selection is unknown. To map differentiation throughout the genome, we hybridized DNA from temperate and subtropical populations to Affymetrix tiling arrays. The dense genomic sampling of variants and low level of linkage disequilibrium in D. melanogaster enabled identification of many small, differentiated regions. Many regions are differentiated in parallel in the United States and Australia, strongly supporting the idea that they are influenced by spatially varying selection. Genomic differentiation is distributed nonrandomly with respect to gene function, even in regions differentiated on only one continent, providing further evidence for the role of selection. These data provide candidate genes for phenotypes known to vary clinally and implicate interesting new processes in genotype-by-environment interactions, including chorion proteins, proteins regulating meiotic recombination and segregation, gustatory and olfactory receptors, and proteins affecting synaptic function and behavior.

By simulating different experimental conditions, the authors find that the proposed model, except for being capable of reproducing some known experimental results well, also can predict some interesting phenomena: 1) The DNs need neuronal projections from the LNs to be rhythmic and to synchronize; 2) the effect of communication on mean amplitude and mean period of two oscillatory groups is different; 3) communication delay can facilitate the network synchronization of the LNs; and 4) only the LNs lose rhythmicity under constant light conditions.

Cis and trans regulatory effects contribute to natural variation in transcriptome of Drosophila melanogaster,17998255,10.1093/molbev/msm247,"The dissection of intraspecific variation in transcriptome is a central theme of many recent quantitative genomic analyses. Transcript level variation has been attributed to factors at the gene itself (cis) and elsewhere in the genome (trans). Previous analyses of Drosophila intraspecific transcriptome variation pointed toward a larger contribution of trans factors. However, data from other genera, and from interspecific comparisons within Drosophila, are more consistent with a major role for cis factors. We investigated the relative amount of cis and trans variation in Drosophila melanogaster, using whole-genome expression from an oligonucleotide microarray in the 2 extensively studied genotypes Ore and 2b3, and 6 recombinant inbred (RI) lines derived from these parents. We examined 2 types of models to decompose cis and trans contributions to genetic variation in transcript level: 1) an infinitesimal model assuming that the transcription variation is highly polygenic and due to many small effects and 2) contrast models assuming that a few large effects contribute to the transcriptional variation. We explicitly fitted cis-by-trans interactions and extended our analyses to consider regulation of alternatively spliced transcripts. We estimated that approximately 10% of the transcriptome was differentially regulated among the lines. We were able to identify cis and trans effects that contribute to this differential regulation for 1,340 genes. Our analyses revealed numerous cis effects (90%) but much fewer trans effects, perhaps due to reduced power of detection for trans effects.

fruitless Gene products truncated of their male-like qualities promote neural and behavioral maleness in Drosophila if these proteins are produced in the right places at the right times,18363163,10.1080/01677060701671947,"To bring GAL4 production under the control of the sex promoter (P1) contained within Drosophila's fruitless gene, a gal4 cassette was previously inserted downstream of P1. This insert should eliminate male-specific FRU(M) proteins, which normally contain 101 amino acids (aa's) at their N termini. Thus males homozygous for the P1-gal4 insert should be courtless, as was briefly stated to be so in the initial report of this transgenic type. But XY flies whose only fru form is P1-gal4 have now been found to court vigorously. P1-gal4 females displayed no appreciable male-like actions except courtship rejection behaviors; yet, they developed a male-specific abdominal muscle. No immunoreactivity against the male-specific aa's was detectable in P1-gal4 flies. But male-like neural signals were observed in XY or XX P1-gal4 pupae and adults after applying an antibody that detects all FRU isoforms; transgenic females displayed reduced expression of such proteins. RT-PCR's rationalized these findings: P1 transcripts include anomalous splice forms from which gal4 was removed, allowing FRU's lacking M aa's to be produced in male-like patterns in both sexes. Within males, such defective proteins promote neural differentiation and function that is sufficient to support spirited P1-gal4 courtship. But dispensability of the male-specific FRU N-terminus is tempered by the finding that intra-fru sequences encoding these 101 aa's are highly conserved among interspecific relatives of D. melanogaster.",2008,"Sarah L Ferri, Rudolf A Bohm, Hayden E Lincicome, Jeffrey C Hall, Adriana Villella, Sarah L Ferri, Rudolf A Bohm, Hayden E Lincicome, Jeffrey C Hall, Adriana Villella"
Extensive gene amplification and concerted evolution within the CPR family of cuticular proteins in mosquitoes,18510978,10.1016/j.ibmb.2008.04.001,"Annotation of the Anopheles gambiae genome has revealed a large increase in the number of genes encoding cuticular proteins with the Rebers and Riddiford Consensus (the CPR gene family) relative to Drosophila melanogaster. This increase reflects an expansion of the RR-2 group of CPR genes, particularly the amplification of sets of highly similar paralogs. Patterns of nucleotide variation indicate that extensive concerted evolution is occurring within these clusters. The pattern of concerted evolution is complex, however, as sequence similarity within clusters is uncorrelated with gene order and orientation, and no comparable clusters occur within similarly compact arrays of the RR-1 group in mosquitoes or in either group in D. melanogaster. The dearth of pseudogenes suggests that sequence clusters are maintained by selection for high gene-copy number, perhaps due to selection for high expression rates. This hypothesis is consistent with the apparently parallel evolution of compact gene architectures within sequence clusters relative to single-copy genes. We show that RR-2 proteins from sequence-cluster genes have complex repeats and extreme amino-acid compositions relative to single-copy CPR proteins in An. gambiae, and that the amino-acid composition of the N-terminal and C-terminal sequence flanking the chitin-binding consensus region evolves in a correlated fashion.",2008,"R Scott Cornman, Judith H Willis, R Scott Cornman, Judith H Willis"

"Dietary composition specifies consumption, obesity, and lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster",18485125,10.1111/j.1474-9726.2008.00400.x,"The inability to properly balance energy intake and expenditure with nutrient supply forms the basis for some of today's most pressing health issues, including diabetes and obesity. Mechanisms of nutrient homeostasis may also lie at the root of dietary restriction, a manipulation whereby reduced nutrient availability extends lifespan and ameliorates age-related deteriorations in many species. The traditional belief that the most important aspect of the diet is its energetic (i.e. caloric) content is currently under scrutiny. Hypotheses that focus on diet composition and highlight more subtle characteristics are beginning to emerge. Using Drosophila melanogaster, we asked whether diet composition alone, independent of its caloric content, was sufficient to impact behavior, physiology, and lifespan. We found that providing flies with a yeast-rich diet produced lean, reproductively competent animals with reduced feeding rates. Excess dietary sugar, on the other hand, promoted obesity, which was magnified during aging. Addition of dietary yeast often limited or reversed the phenotypic changes associated with increased dietary sugar and vice versa, and dietary imbalance was associated with reduced lifespan. Our data reveal that diet composition, alone and in combination with overall caloric intake, modulates lifespan, consumption, and fat deposition in flies, and they provide a useful foundation for dissecting the underlying genetic mechanisms that link specific nutrients with important aspects of general health and longevity.",2008,"Danielle A Skorupa, Azra Dervisefendic, Jessica Zwiener, Scott D Pletcher, Danielle A Skorupa, Azra Dervisefendic, Jessica Zwiener, Scott D Pletcher"

We used the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the responses to DR of flies mutant for the transcription factor dFOXO, the main transcription factor target of IIS. We found that lifespan extension by DR does not require dFOXO. However, flies with dFOXO overexpressed in the adult fat body showed an altered response to DR and behaved as though partially dietarily restricted.

Recurrent deletion and gene presence/absence polymorphism: telomere dynamics dominate evolution at the tip of 3L in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans,18505885,10.1534/genetics.107.078345,"Although Drosophila melanogaster has been the subject of intensive analysis of polymorphism and divergence, little is known about the distribution of variation at the most distal regions of chromosomes arms. Here we report a survey of genetic variation on the tip of 3L in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Levels of single nucleotide polymorphism in the most distal euchromatic sequence are approximately one order of magnitude less than that typically observed in genomic regions of normal crossing over, consistent with what might be expected under models of linked selection in regions of low crossing over. However, despite this reduced level of nucleotide variation, we found abundant deletion polymorphism. These deletions create at least three gene presence/absence polymorphisms within D. melanogaster: the putative G-protein coupled receptor mthl-8 (which is the most distal known or predicted gene on 3L) and the unannotated mRNAs AY060886 and BT006009. Strikingly, D. simulans is also segregating deletions that cause mthl8 presence/absence polymorphism. Breakpoint sequencing and tests of correlations with segregating SNPs in D. melanogaster suggest that each deletion is unique. Cloned breakpoint sequences revealed the presence of Het-A elements just distal to unique, canonical euchromatic sequences. This pattern suggests a model in which repeated telomeric deficiencies cause deletions of euchromatic sequence followed by subsequent ""healing"" by retrotranposition of Het-A elements.

We show that the constancy stability of the selected populations is significantly higher than their controls, confirming a previous observation that population stability can evolve as a by-product of life-history evolution. This enhanced constancy stability is due to a reduced maximal per capita growth rate, brought about by a reduction in fecundity of the selected populations as a result of the trade-off between developmental rate and fecundity. 4. Persistence stability, as reflected by the probability of extinction, does not differ significantly between selected and control populations. 5. We also show how seemingly trivial experimental details, such as the protocol for restarting extinct populations, can interact with life-history traits to alter the manifestation of the stability properties of a population.",2008,"Sutirth Dey, N G Prasad, Mallikarjun Shakarad, Amitabh Joshi, Sutirth Dey, N G Prasad, Mallikarjun Shakarad, Amitabh Joshi"
Label-free imaging of Drosophila larva by multiphoton autofluorescence and second harmonic generation microscopy,19021374,10.1117/1.2981817,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most valuable organisms in studying genetics and developmental biology. To gain insight into Drosophila development, we successfully acquired label-free, in vivo images of both developing muscles and internal organs in a stage 2 larva using the minimally invasive imaging modality of multiphoton autofluorescence (MAF) and second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. We found that although MAF is useful in identifying structures such as the digestive system, trachea, and intestinal track, it is the SHG signal that allowed the investigation of the muscular architecture within the developing larva.

In cardioblasts, Slit and Robo modulate the cell shape changes and domains of E-cadherin-based adhesion that drive lumen formation. Furthermore, in contrast to the well-known paracrine role of Slit and Robo in guiding cell migrations, here Slit and Robo may act by autocrine signaling. In addition, the two groups demonstrate that heart lumen formation is even more distinct from typical epithelial tubulogenesis mechanisms because the heart lumen is bounded by membrane surfaces that have basal rather than apical attributes. As the D. melanogaster cardioblasts are thought to have significant evolutionary similarity to vertebrate endothelial and cardiac lineages, these findings are likely to provide insights into mechanisms of vertebrate heart and vascular morphogenesis.",2008,"Iiro Taneli Helenius, Greg J Beitel, Iiro Taneli Helenius, Greg J Beitel"

Nonrandom Wolbachia infection status of Drosophila melanogaster strains with different mtDNA haplotypes,18780877,10.1093/molbev/msn199,"Wolbachia are maternally inherited bacteria, which typically spread in the host population by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). In Drosophila melanogaster, Wolbachia is quite common but CI is variable, with most of the studies reporting low levels of CI. Surveying mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation and infection status in a worldwide D. melanogaster collection, we found that the Wolbachia infection was not randomly distributed among flies with different mtDNA haplotypes. This preferential infection of some mtDNA haplotypes could be caused by a recent spread of mtDNA haplotypes associated with the infection. The comparison of contemporary D. melanogaster samples with lines collected more than 50 years ago shows that indeed one haplotype with a high incidence of Wolbachia infection has increased in frequency. Consistent with this observation, we found that the acquisition of a Wolbachia infection in a population from Crete was accompanied with an almost complete mtDNA replacement, with the Wolbachia-associated haplotype becoming abundant. Although it is difficult to identify the evolutionary forces causing the global increase of wMel, the parallel sweep of Wolbachia and an mtDNA haplotype suggests a fitness advantage of the Wolbachia infection.",2008,"Maria D S Nunes, Viola Nolte, Christian SchlÃ¶tterer"
Enhanced function annotations for Drosophila serine proteases: a case study for systematic annotation of multi-member gene families,17996400,10.1016/j.gene.2007.10.012,"Systematically annotating function of enzymes that belong to large protein families encoded in a single eukaryotic genome is a very challenging task. We carried out such an exercise to annotate function for serine-protease family of the trypsin fold in Drosophila melanogaster, with an emphasis on annotating serine-protease homologues (SPHs) that may have lost their catalytic function. Our approach involves data mining and data integration to provide function annotations for 190 Drosophila gene products containing serine-protease-like domains, of which 35 are SPHs. This was accomplished by analysis of structure-function relationships, gene-expression profiles, large-scale protein-protein interaction data, literature mining and bioinformatic tools. We introduce functional residue clustering (FRC), a method that performs hierarchical clustering of sequences using properties of functionally important residues and utilizes correlation co-efficient as a quantitative similarity measure to transfer in vivo substrate specificities to proteases. We show that the efficiency of transfer of substrate-specificity information using this method is generally high. FRC was also applied on Drosophila proteases to assign putative competitive inhibitor relationships (CIRs). Microarray gene-expression data were utilized to uncover a large-scale and dual involvement of proteases in development and in immune response. We found specific recruitment of SPHs and proteases with CLIP domains in immune response, suggesting evolution of a new function for SPHs. We also suggest existence of separate downstream protease cascades for immune response against bacterial/fungal infections and parasite/parasitoid infections. We verify quality of our annotations using information from RNAi screens and other evidence types.

The first gene to be identified that encodes a Wnt signalling component, Int1 (integration 1), was molecularly characterized from mouse tumour cells 25 years ago. In parallel, the homologous gene Wingless in Drosophila melanogaster, which produces developmental defects in embryos, was characterized. Since then, further components of the Wnt pathway have been identified and their epistatic relationships have been defined.

Behavioral dissection of the Drosophila circadian multioscillator system that regulates locomotor rhythms,19267626,10.2108/zsj.25.1146,"The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster , shows a bimodal circadian activity rhythm with peaks around light-on and before light-off. This rhythm is driven by seven groups of so-called clock neurons in the brain. To dissect the multioscillatory nature of the Drosophila clock system, the process of reentrainment to a reversed light cycle was examined by using wild-type flies and cry(b) mutant flies that carry a strong loss-of-function mutation in cryptochrome (cry) gene. The wild-type flies showed that the morning peak dissociated into two components, while a substantial fraction of cry(b) flies exhibited dissociation of the evening peak into two components that shifted in different directions. When the temperature cycle was given in constant darkness in such a manner that the thermophase corresponded to the previous night phase, the morning peak also split into two components in wild-type flies. These results suggest that both morning and evening peaks are driven by two separate oscillators that have different entrainability to light and temperature cycles. Examination of the process of reentrainment to a reversed LD in mutant flies that lack some of the four known circadian photoreceptors (compound eyes, ocelli, CRYPTOCHROME [CRY], and Hofbauer-Buchner [H-B] eyelets) revealed that these four photoreceptors play different roles in photic entrainment of the four putative oscillators.",2008,"Yujiro Umezaki, Kenji Tomioka, Yujiro Umezaki, Kenji Tomioka"
Two distinct mechanisms generate endogenous siRNAs from bidirectional transcription in Drosophila melanogaster,18500351,10.1038/nsmb.1438,"Cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs) have been speculated to be substrates for endogenous RNA interference (RNAi), but little experimental evidence for such a pathway in animals has been reported. Analysis of massive Drosophila melanogaster small RNA data sets now reveals two mechanisms that yield endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) via bidirectional transcription. First, >100 cis-NATs with overlapping 3' exons generate 21-nt, and, based on previously published small RNA data [corrected] Dicer-2 (Dcr-2)-dependent, 3'-end modified siRNAs. The processing of cis-NATs by RNA interference (RNAi) seems to be actively restricted, and the selected loci are enriched for nucleic acid-based functions and include Argonaute-2 (AGO2) itself. Second, we report that extended intervals of the thickveins and klarsicht genes generate exceptionally abundant siRNAs from both strands. These siRNA clusters derive from atypical cis-NAT arrangements involving introns and 5' or internal exons, but their biogenesis is similarly Dcr-2- and AGO2-dependent.

Multimodal chemosensory integration through the maxillary palp in Drosophila,18478104,10.1371/journal.pone.0002191,"Drosophila melanogaster has an olfactory organ called the maxillary palp. It is smaller and numerically simpler than the antenna, and its specific role in behavior has long been unclear. Because of its proximity to the mouthparts, I explored the possibility of a role in taste behavior. Maxillary palp was tuned to mediate odor-induced taste enhancement: a sucrose solution was more appealing when simultaneously presented with the odorant 4-methylphenol. The same result was observed with other odors that stimulate other types of olfactory receptor neuron in the maxillary palp. When an antennal olfactory receptor was genetically introduced in the maxillary palp, the fly interpreted a new odor as a sweet-enhancing smell. These results all point to taste enhancement as a function of the maxillary palp. It also opens the door for studying integration of multiple senses in a model organism.",2008,"Takashi Shiraiwa, Takashi Shiraiwa"

To perform a comprehensive analysis of paralogous testis-biased genes, we characterized the testes transcriptome of Drosophila melanogaster by comparing gene expression in testes vs. ovaries, heads, and gonadectomized males. A number of the identified 399 testis-biased genes code for the known components of mature sperm. Among the detected 69 genes downregulated in testes, a large fraction is required for viability. By analyzing paralogs of testis-biased genes, we identified ""co-regulated"" paralogous pairs in which both genes are testis biased, ""anti-regulated"" pairs in which one paralog is testis biased and the other downregulated in testes, and ""neutral"" pairs in which one paralog is testis biased and the other constitutively expressed. The numbers of identified co-regulated and anti-regulated pairs were higher than expected by chance. Testis-biased genes included in these pairs show decreased frequency of lethal mutations, suggesting their specific role in male reproduction. These genes also show exceptionally high interspecific variability of expression in comparison between D. melanogaster and the closely related D. simulans. Further, interspecific changes in testis bias of expression are generally correlated within the co-regulated pairs and are anti-correlated within the anti-regulated pairs, suggesting coordinated regulation within both types of paralogous gene pairs.",2008,"Lyudmila M Mikhaylova, Kimberly Nguyen, Dmitry I Nurminsky, Lyudmila M Mikhaylova, Kimberly Nguyen, Dmitry I Nurminsky"
Visualization of PCP defects in the eye and wing of Drosophila melanogaster,19109708,10.1007/978-1-60327-469-2_11,"""Tissue"" or ""planar"" polarity is a characteristic of many epithelial tissues and is not only required for proper cell alignment, but in many instances is absolutely essential for normal function. Planar cell polarity (PCP) is the polarization of cells within the plane of an epithelium in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the apico-basal polarity. The oriented hair alignment in mammalian skin (feather in birds or scales in fish) and highly organized stereocilia bundles in the vertebrate inner ear are examples of such tissue organization. PCP was first described in Drosophila, with non-canonical Wnt signaling (also called PCP signaling, see Chapter 10, Volume 1) shown to be critical for its establishment. Two of the best characterized PCP models in Drosophila are the developing wing and the eye, where the graded activity of the Frizzled (Fz) receptor determines proximo-distal orientation of the wing hairs and mirror-imaged patterning of ommatidia, respectively. In this chapter, we describe simple methods to visualize PCP defects in the Drosophila eye and wing, in both developing and adult tissues.

Chromosomal rearrangement inferred from comparisons of 12 Drosophila genomes,18622036,10.1534/genetics.107.086108,"The availability of 12 complete genomes of various species of genus Drosophila provides a unique opportunity to analyze genome-scale chromosomal rearrangements among a group of closely related species. This article reports on the comparison of gene order between these 12 species and on the fixed rearrangement events that disrupt gene order. Three major themes are addressed: the conservation of syntenic blocks across species, the disruption of syntenic blocks (via chromosomal inversion events) and its relationship to the phylogenetic distribution of these species, and the rate of rearrangement events over evolutionary time. Comparison of syntenic blocks across this large genomic data set confirms that genetic elements are largely (95%) localized to the same Muller element across genus Drosophila species and paracentric inversions serve as the dominant mechanism for shuffling the order of genes along a chromosome. Gene-order scrambling between species is in accordance with the estimated evolutionary distances between them and we find it to approximate a linear process over time (linear to exponential with alternate divergence time estimates). We find the distribution of synteny segment sizes to be biased by a large number of small segments with comparatively fewer large segments. Our results provide estimated chromosomal evolution rates across this set of species on the basis of whole-genome synteny analysis, which are found to be higher than those previously reported. Identification of conserved syntenic blocks across these genomes suggests a large number of conserved blocks with varying levels of embryonic expression correlation in Drosophila melanogaster. On the other hand, an analysis of the disruption of syntenic blocks between species allowed the identification of fixed inversion breakpoints and estimates of breakpoint reuse and lineage-specific breakpoint event segregation.",2008,"Arjun Bhutkar, Stephen W Schaeffer, Susan M Russo, Mu Xu, Temple F Smith, William M Gelbart, Arjun Bhutkar, Stephen W Schaeffer, Susan M Russo, Mu Xu, Temple F Smith, William M Gelbart"

Location of P element insertions in the proximal promoter region of Hsp70A is consequential for gene expression and correlated with fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster,18347937,10.1007/s12192-007-0002-4,"We compared a series of Drosophila strains with P element insertions from -28 to -144 nucleotides 5' to the transcription start site of the Hsp70A genes-corresponding to the range of naturally occurring P element insertion sites-to elucidate the consequences of insertion site for Hsp70A gene expression. Although all insertions reduced Hsp70A expression below that of a control strain, the magnitude of the reduction was inversely related to the number of nucleotides between the transcription start site and the insertion site. A pre-existing hypothesis is that naturally occurring transposable element insertions in Hsp promoters may be beneficial in some circumstances, which may account for their retention in natural populations. In the present study, in a control line heat shock reduced fecundity, whereas in lines with P element insertions heat shock typically increased fecundity.

In dAda3 mutants, acetylation at histone H3 K9 and K14, but not K18, and at histone H4 K12, but not K5, K8, and K16, is significantly reduced. Also, phosphorylation at H3 S10 is reduced in dAda3 and dGcn5 mutants.

Rapid functional diversification in the structurally conserved ELAV family of neuronal RNA binding proteins,18715504,10.1186/1471-2164-9-392,"Background:
      
    

    
      The Drosophila gene embryonic lethal abnormal visual system (elav) is the prototype of a gene family present in all metazoans. Its members encode structurally conserved neuronal proteins with three RNA Recognition Motifs (RRM) but they paradoxically act at diverse levels of post-transcriptional regulation. In an attempt to understand the history of this family, we searched for orthologs in eleven completely sequenced genomes, including those of humans, D. melanogaster and C. elegans, for which cDNAs are available.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We analyzed 23 orthologs/paralogs of elav, and found evidence of gain/loss of gene copy number. For one set of genes, including elav itself, the coding sequences are free of introns and their products most resemble ELAV. The remaining genes show remarkable conservation of their exon organization, and their products most resemble FNE and RBP9, proteins encoded by the two elav paralogs of Drosophila. Remarkably, three of the conserved exon junctions are both close to structural elements, involved respectively in protein-RNA interactions and in the regulation of sub-cellular localization, and in the vicinity of diverse sequence variations.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The data indicate that the essential elav gene of Drosophila is newly emerged, restricted to dipterans and of retrotransposed origin. We propose that the conserved exon junctions constitute potential sites for sequence/function modifications, and that RRM binding proteins, whose function relies upon plastic RNA-protein interactions, may have played an important role in brain evolution.",2008,"Marie-Laure Samson, Marie-Laure Samson"
"Age, but not experience, affects courtship gene expression in male Drosophila melanogaster",19582156,10.1371/journal.pone.0006150,"Mutation screens in model organisms have helped identify the foundation of many fundamental organismal phenotypes.

A related question is whether individual differences arise from static differences in gene expression that arose during previous life stages, or whether they are due to dynamic regulation of expression during the life stage under investigation. Here, we address these questions using genes that have been discovered to control the development of normal courtship behavior in male Drosophila melanogaster. We examined whether these genes have static or dynamic expression in the heads of adult male flies of different ages and with different levels of social experience. We found that 16 genes of the 25 genes examined were statically expressed, and 9 genes were dynamically expressed with changes related to adult age. No genes exhibited rapid dynamic expression changes due to social experience or age*experience interaction. We therefore conclude that a majority of fly ""courtship"" genes are statically expressed, while a minority are regulated in adults with respect to age, but not with respect to relevant social experience. These results are consistent with those from a recent microarray analysis that found none of the canonical courtship genes changed expression in male flies after brief exposure to females.",2009,"Elizabeth A Ruedi, Kimberly A Hughes, Elizabeth A Ruedi, Kimberly A Hughes"
Abundant conserved microRNA target sites in the 5'-untranslated region and coding sequence,19578934,10.1007/s10709-009-9378-7,"Recent studies have shown that miRNAs can target the promoter and CDS region. Thus, we predicted miRNA target sites in the 5'-UTR, CDS and 3'-UTR of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Drosophila melanogaster using miRanda and TargetScan. Target-site densities normalized with the average region length were higher in the 5'-UTR than 3'-UTR in all three organisms but were lower in the negative data set. Interestingly, the putative target sites were more conserved than non-target regions in both the 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR, implying that target sites in the 5'-UTR are subject to high selective pressure and might be functional. In Drosophila, 48 of 78 (61.5%) miRNAs showed high similarities with predicted siRNAs. Based on the results of previous experimental studies and a large-scale statistical analysis, we conclude that miRNA-mediated regulation is not limited to the 3'-UTR. However, the functionality of target sites in the 5'-UTR and CDS requires thorough investigation.",2009,"Xue Zhou, Xuchu Duan, Jinjun Qian, Fei Li, Xue Zhou, Xuchu Duan, Jinjun Qian, Fei Li"
Modeling the temporal evolution of the Drosophila gene expression from DNA microarray time series,19171963,10.1088/1478-3975/6/1/016004,"The time evolution of gene expression across the developmental stages of the host organism can be inferred from appropriate DNA microarray time series. Modeling this evolution aims eventually at improving the understanding and prediction of the complex phenomena that are the basis of life. We focus on the embryonic-to-adult development phases of Drosophila melanogaster, and chose to model the expression network with the help of a system of differential equations with constant coefficients, which are nonlinear in the transcript concentrations but linear in their logarithms. To reduce the dimensionality of the problem, genes having similar expression profiles are grouped into 17 clusters. We show that a simple linear model is able to reproduce the experimental data with very good precision, owing to the large number of parameters that represent the connections between the clusters. Remarkably, the parameter reduction allowed elimination of up to 80-85% of these connections while keeping fairly good precision. This result supports the low-connectivity hypothesis of gene expression networks, with about three connections per cluster, without introducing a priori hypotheses. The core of the network shows a few gene clusters with negative self-regulation, and some highly connected clusters involving proteins with crucial functions.",2009,"Alexandre Haye, Yves Dehouck, Jean Marc Kwasigroch, Philippe Bogaerts, Marianne Rooman, Alexandre Haye, Yves Dehouck, Jean Marc Kwasigroch, Philippe Bogaerts, Marianne Rooman"
Relationship between gene co-expression and sharing of transcription factor binding sites in Drosophila melanogaster,19633094,10.1093/bioinformatics/btp462,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      In functional genomics, it is frequently useful to correlate expression levels of genes to identify transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) via the presence of common sequence motifs. The underlying assumption is that co-expressed genes are more likely to contain shared TFBS and, thus, TFBS can be identified computationally. Indeed, gene pairs with a very high expression correlation show a significant excess of shared binding sites in yeast. We have tested this assumption in a more complex organism, Drosophila melanogaster, by using experimentally determined TFBS and microarray expression data. We have also examined the reverse relationship between the expression correlation and the extent of TFBS sharing.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Pairs of genes with shared TFBS show, on average, a higher degree of co-expression than those with no common TFBS in Drosophila. However, the reverse does not hold true: gene pairs with high expression correlations do not share significantly larger numbers of TFBS. Exception to this observation exists when comparing expression of genes from the earliest stages of embryonic development. Interestingly, semantic similarity between gene annotations (Biological Process) is much better associated with TFBS sharing, as compared to the expression correlation. We discuss these results in light of reverse engineering approaches to computationally predict regulatory sequences by using comparative genomics.",2009,"Antonio Marco, Charlotte Konikoff, Timothy L Karr, Sudhir Kumar, Antonio Marco, Charlotte Konikoff, Timothy L Karr, Sudhir Kumar"
"Separating the spindle, checkpoint, and timer functions of BubR1",19951912,10.1083/jcb.200905026,"BubR1 performs several roles during mitosis, affecting the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), mitotic timing, and spindle function, but the interdependence of these functions is unclear. We have analyzed in Drosophila melanogaster the mitotic phenotypes of kinase-dead (KD) BubR1 and BubR1 lacking the N-terminal KEN box. bubR1-KD individuals have a robust SAC but abnormal spindles with thin kinetochore fibers, suggesting that the kinase activity modulates microtubule capture and/or dynamics but is relatively dispensable for SAC function. In contrast, bubR1-KEN flies have normal spindles but no SAC. Nevertheless, mitotic timing is normal as long as Mad2 is present. Thus, the SAC, timer, and spindle functions of BubR1 are substantially separable. Timing is shorter in bubR1-KEN mad2 double mutants, yet in these flies, lacking both critical SAC components, chromosomes still segregate accurately, reconfirming that in Drosophila, reliable mitosis does not need the SAC.",2009,"Zohra Rahmani, Mary E Gagou, Christophe Lefebvre, Doruk Emre, Roger E Karess, Zohra Rahmani, Mary E Gagou, Christophe Lefebvre, Doruk Emre, Roger E Karess"
Sensory integration regulating male courtship behavior in Drosophila,19214231,10.1371/journal.pone.0004457,"The courtship behavior of Drosophila melanogaster serves as an excellent model system to study how complex innate behaviors are controlled by the nervous system. To understand how the underlying neural network controls this behavior, it is not sufficient to unravel its architecture, but also crucial to decipher its logic. By systematic analysis of how variations in sensory inputs alter the courtship behavior of a naÃ¯ve male in the single-choice courtship paradigm, we derive a model describing the logic of the network that integrates the various sensory stimuli and elicits this complex innate behavior. This approach and the model derived from it distinguish (i) between initiation and maintenance of courtship, (ii) between courtship in daylight and in the dark, where the male uses a scanning strategy to retrieve the decamping female, and (iii) between courtship towards receptive virgin females and mature males. The last distinction demonstrates that sexual orientation of the courting male, in the absence of discriminatory visual cues, depends on the integration of gustatory and behavioral feedback inputs, but not on olfactory signals from the courted animal. The model will complement studies on the connectivity and intrinsic properties of the neurons forming the circuitry that regulates male courtship behavior.",2009,"Dimitrije Krstic, Werner Boll, Markus Noll, Dimitrije Krstic, Werner Boll, Markus Noll"
Sexual selection and the random union of gametes: testing for a correlation in fitness between mates in Drosophila melanogaster,19757995,10.1086/605960,"Both males and females vary in fitness. While high-fitness males typically have greater siring success, it is not clear whether these males sire an equal fraction of offspring from all females or a disproportionately large fraction with high-fitness females. The latter nonrandom reproductive pattern can arise as the result of sexual selection and creates a positive correlation in fitness between mates. Such a correlation, if it reflects a positive genetic correlation between mates with respect to fitness, increases the efficiency of selection, reducing mutation load and speeding adaptation. While there is evidence from many taxa that assortative mating for fitness may occur, these studies typically focus on observed matings rather than realized reproductive output. Here, we examine assortative mating for fitness in Drosophila melanogaster, first in the context of virgin matings and then using a measure of realized reproduction that incorporates remating and postcopulatory processes. We find evidence for positive assortative mating among virgins but no evidence of assortative mating using the more complete measure of reproduction.",2009,"Nathaniel P Sharp, Aneil F Agrawal, Nathaniel P Sharp, Aneil F Agrawal"
Genome-wide identification of alternative splice forms down-regulated by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in Drosophila,19543372,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000525,"Alternative mRNA splicing adds a layer of regulation to the expression of thousands of genes in Drosophila melanogaster. Not all alternative splicing results in functional protein; it can also yield mRNA isoforms with premature stop codons that are degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. This coupling of alternative splicing and NMD provides a mechanism for gene regulation that is highly conserved in mammals. NMD is also active in Drosophila, but its effect on the repertoire of alternative splice forms has been unknown, as has the mechanism by which it recognizes targets. Here, we have employed a custom splicing-sensitive microarray to globally measure the effect of alternative mRNA processing and NMD on Drosophila gene expression. We have developed a new algorithm to infer the expression change of each mRNA isoform of a gene based on the microarray measurements. This method is of general utility for interpreting splicing-sensitive microarrays and high-throughput sequence data. Using this approach, we have identified a high-confidence set of 45 genes where NMD has a differential effect on distinct alternative isoforms, including numerous RNA-binding and ribosomal proteins. Coupled alternative splicing and NMD decrease expression of these genes, which may in turn have a downstream effect on expression of other genes. The NMD-affected genes are enriched for roles in translation and mitosis, perhaps underlying the previously observed role of NMD factors in cell cycle progression. Our results have general implications for understanding the NMD mechanism in fly. Most notably, we found that the NMD-target mRNAs had significantly longer 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) than the nontarget isoforms of the same genes, supporting a role for 3' UTR length in the recognition of NMD targets in fly.",2009,"Kasper Daniel Hansen, Liana F Lareau, Marco Blanchette, Richard E Green, Qi Meng, Jan Rehwinkel, Fabian L Gallusser, Elisa Izaurralde, Donald C Rio, Sandrine Dudoit, Steven E Brenner, Kasper Daniel Hansen, Liana F Lareau, Marco Blanchette, Richard E Green, Qi Meng, Jan Rehwinkel, Fabian L Gallusser, Elisa Izaurralde, Donald C Rio, Sandrine Dudoit, Steven E Brenner"
Genomic consequences of background effects on scalloped mutant expressivity in the wing of Drosophila melanogaster,19064709,10.1534/genetics.108.096453,"Genetic background effects contribute to the phenotypic consequences of mutations and are pervasive across all domains of life that have been examined, yet little is known about how they modify genetic systems. In part this is due to the lack of tractable model systems that have been explicitly developed to study the genetic and evolutionary consequences of background effects. In this study we demonstrate that phenotypic expressivity of the scalloped(E3) (sd(E3)) mutation of Drosophila melanogaster is background dependent and is the result of at least one major modifier segregating between two standard lab wild-type strains. We provide evidence that at least one of the modifiers is linked to the vestigial region and demonstrate that the background effects modify the spatial distribution of known sd target genes in a genotype-dependent manner. In addition, microarrays were used to examine the consequences of genetic background effects on the global transcriptome. Expression differences between wild-type strains were found to be as large as or larger than the effects of mutations with substantial phenotypic effects, and expression differences between wild type and mutant varied significantly between genetic backgrounds. Significantly, we demonstrate that the epistatic interaction between sd(E3) and an optomotor blind mutation is background dependent. The results are discussed within the context of developing a complex but more realistic view of the consequences of genetic background effects with respect to mutational analysis and studies of epistasis and cryptic genetic variation segregating in natural populations.",2009,"Ian Dworkin, Erin Kennerly, David Tack, Jennifer Hutchinson, Julie Brown, James Mahaffey, Greg Gibson, Ian Dworkin, Erin Kennerly, David Tack, Jennifer Hutchinson, Julie Brown, James Mahaffey, Greg Gibson"
Systems genetics of complex traits in Drosophila melanogaster,19234471,10.1038/ng.332,"Determining the genetic architecture of complex traits is challenging because phenotypic variation arises from interactions between multiple, environmentally sensitive alleles.

The transcriptome is highly genetically intercorrelated, forming 241 transcriptional modules. Modules are enriched for transcripts in common pathways, gene ontology categories, tissue-specific expression and transcription factor binding sites. The high degree of transcriptional connectivity allows us to infer genetic networks and the function of predicted genes from annotations of other genes in the network.

Apolipoprotein E-mimetics inhibit neurodegeneration and restore cognitive functions in a transgenic Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease,19997607,10.1371/journal.pone.0008191,"Background:
      
    

    
      Mutations of the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) are found in familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and some lead to the elevated production of amyloid-beta-protein (Abeta). While Abeta has been implicated in the causation of AD, the exact role played by Abeta and its APP precursor are still unclear.
    

    
  


        Principal findings:
      
    

    
      In our study, Drosophila melanogaster transgenics were established as a model to analyze AD-like pathology caused by APP overexpression. We demonstrated that age related changes in the levels and pattern of synaptic proteins accompanied progressive neurodegeneration and impairment of cognitive functions in APP transgenic flies, but that these changes may be independent from the generation of Abeta. Using novel peptide mimetics of Apolipoprotein-E, COG112 or COG133 proved to be neuroprotective and significantly improved the learning and memory of APP transgenic flies.

The two medfly hsp23 genes are transcribed in opposite directions and encode two almost identical proteins. Furthermore, the two genes exhibit a very high degree of similarity in their 5' untranslated and proximal promoter regions. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the CcHsp23 proteins are orthologous to Drosophila Hsp23 and Sarcophaga crassipalpis Hsp23. Structural analysis of the 5' flanking regions of the Cchsp23 genes revealed the presence of several putative heat shock elements. Both CcHsp23 genes are induced by heat in a similar manner. In addition to heat-induction, the Cchsp23 genes are expressed at several stages of normal development as well as in ovaries and testes. In general, the developmental expression patterns of the medfly genes are similar, suggesting that they are under similar regulatory mechanisms. However, the expression of the Cchsp23 genes differs significantly from the expression of the Drosophila hsp23 gene in certain embryonic and larval stages, suggesting differential regulation of the hsp23 genes in the two dipteran species.

Microinjection techniques for studying mitosis in the Drosophila melanogaster syncytial embryo,19755959,10.3791/1382,"This protocol describes the use of the Drosophila melanogaster syncytial embryo for studying mitosis. Drosophila has useful genetics with a sequenced genome, and it can be easily maintained and manipulated. Many mitotic mutants exist, and transgenic flies expressing functional fluorescently (e.g. GFP) - tagged mitotic proteins have been and are being generated. Targeted gene expression is possible using the GAL4/UAS system. The Drosophila early embryo carries out multiple mitoses very rapidly (cell cycle duration, asymptotically equal to 10 min). It is well suited for imaging mitosis, because during cycles 10-13, nuclei divide rapidly and synchronously without intervening cytokinesis at the surface of the embryo in a single monolayer just underneath the cortex. These rapidly dividing nuclei probably use the same mitotic machinery as other cells, but they are optimized for speed; the checkpoint is generally believed to not be stringent, allowing the study of mitotic proteins whose absence would cause cell cycle arrest in cells with a strong checkpoint. Embryos expressing GFP labeled proteins or microinjected with fluorescently labeled proteins can be easily imaged to follow live dynamics (Fig. 1). In addition, embryos can be microinjected with function-blocking antibodies or inhibitors of specific proteins to study the effect of the loss or perturbation of their function. These reagents can diffuse throughout the embryo, reaching many spindles to produce a gradient of concentration of inhibitor, which in turn results in a gradient of defects comparable to an allelic series of mutants. Ideally, if the target protein is fluorescently labeled, the gradient of inhibition can be directly visualized. It is assumed that the strongest phenotype is comparable to the null phenotype, although it is hard to formally exclude the possibility that the antibodies may have dominant effects in rare instances, so rigorous controls and cautious interpretation must be applied. Further away from the injection site, protein function is only partially lost allowing other functions of the target protein to become evident.",2009,"Ingrid Brust-Mascher, Jonathan M Scholey, Ingrid Brust-Mascher, Jonathan M Scholey"
Impact of gene copy number variation on anesthesia in Drosophila melanogaster,19546691,10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181a3276c,"Background:
      
    

    
      Chromosomal deletions and duplications, which result in halving or doubling of copy number in a block of genes, are an important source of variation between individuals. Phenotypic effects of copy number variation are commonly observed, but effects on sensitivity to volatile anesthetics have not been assessed in any organism.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      The potency with which halothane depresses the righting reflex of fruit flies was measured in congenic Drosophila strains, each of which was heterozygous for a deletion of average size 400 kb. Over 200 strains were examined, thereby scanning approximately half of the fly genome.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Although the vast majority of deletion heterozygotes were indistinguishable from the control, eight had significantly altered sensitivity to halothane. Genetic tests supported the hypothesis that the change in anesthetic sensitivity was the result of reduction in copy number and not adventitious mutations in the strains. Among the eight outliers, the difference in halothane potency ranged from a 25% increase to a 15% decrease. Changes of similar magnitude but distinctive patterns were found when these lines were tested with enflurane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Variation in gene copy number has a significant impact on anesthetic sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster. The level of transcription of a few genes must thus be limiting for a normal response to volatiles. Coupling between gene copy and gene expression is universal, and the components of the fly's nervous system are highly conserved; therefore, this work provides a rationale for investigating the clinical impact of copy number variation.",2009,"Debasmita P Alone, Jason C Rodriguez, Cameron L Noland, Howard A Nash, Debasmita P Alone, Jason C Rodriguez, Cameron L Noland, Howard A Nash"

A recent adaptive transposable element insertion near highly conserved developmental loci in Drosophila melanogaster,19458110,10.1093/molbev/msp107,"A recent genomewide screen identified 13 transposable elements that are likely to have been adaptive during or after the spread of Drosophila melanogaster out of Africa. One of these insertions, Bari-Juvenile hormone epoxy hydrolase (Bari-Jheh), was associated with the selective sweep of its flanking neutral variation and with reduction of expression of one of its neighboring genes: Jheh3. Here, we provide further evidence that Bari-Jheh insertion is adaptive. We delimit the extent of the selective sweep and show that Bari-Jheh is the only mutation linked to the sweep. Bari-Jheh also lowers the expression of its other flanking gene, Jheh2. Subtle consequences of Bari-Jheh insertion on life-history traits are consistent with the effects of reduced expression of the Jheh genes. Finally, we analyze molecular evolution of Jheh genes in both the long- and the short-term and conclude that Bari-Jheh appears to be a very rare adaptive event in the history of these genes.

Effects of host genotype against the expression of spiroplasma-induced male killing in Drosophila melanogaster,19223920,10.1038/hdy.2009.14,"Increasing attention has been paid to the maternally inherited microbes that are capable of manipulating the reproduction of their hosts for their own benefit. Although several studies have revealed that the host genotype can affect the intensity of the manipulation, the underlying genetic basis is poorly understood. Here, we examined the intensity of spiroplasma-induced male killing in various wild-type stocks of Drosophila melanogaster to clarify the genetic basis of the host factors responsible for the variation in the male-killing intensity. Among ten lines examined by mating experiments (that is, nuclear introgression), eight lines including Oregon-R and Canton-S were found to have nuclear factors that allowed strong expression of male killing. In contrast, the nuclear factors of the lines Sevelen and Hikone partially suppressed or remarkably retarded the expression of male killing. These results were confirmed by artificial transfer experiments of spiroplasma infection across the fly lines by means of microinjection. A series of mating experiments revealed that the nuclear factors acting against male killing were mainly located on autosomes in Sevelen and on the X chromosome in Hikone. In both lines, the suppressors were inferred to act maternally with a dominant effect. The nuclear factors of Sevelen and Hikone scarcely affected spiroplasma densities in reproductively active young insects, suggesting that the suppressors may act on the male-killing expression directly rather than through suppressing bacterial proliferation.",2009,"D Kageyama, H Anbutsu, M Shimada, T Fukatsu, D Kageyama, H Anbutsu, M Shimada, T Fukatsu"
Expression and localization of clathrin heavy chain in Drosophila melanogaster,19577664,10.1016/j.gep.2009.06.007,"Clathrin-coated vesicles mediate cellular endocytosis of nutrients and molecules that are involved in a variety of biological processes. Basic components of the vesicle coat are clathrin heavy chain (Chc) and clathrin light chain molecules. In Drosophila melanogaster the chc gene function has been analyzed in a number of previous studies mainly using genetic approaches. However, the chc mRNA and protein expression patterns have not been studied systematically. We have generated an antibody that specifically recognizes Chc and we have analyzed chc RNA and protein expression patterns throughout embryonic and larval stages. We found that chc mRNA and protein are highly expressed from early stages of embryogenesis onwards, consistent with genetic studies predicting a maternal contribution of the gene function. During subsequent stages mRNA and protein are co-expressed in all embryonic cells; however we found an up-regulation in specific tissues including the gut, the salivary glands, tracheal system and the epidermis. In addition the central nervous system and the nephrocyte-like garland cells show strong Chc expression at late embryogenesis. In larvae Chc is highly expressed in garland cells, imaginal discs, fat body, salivary glands and the ring gland. Subcellularly, we found Chc protein in a vesicle-like pattern within the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane. Co-labeling studies show that Chc is partially in contact with the trans-Golgi network and co-localizes with markers for early endocytosis.

Anti-DNA.RNA duplexes did not react with the complex formed between chromosomal poly(dA) and exogenous polyuridylic acid (poly(rU)). Additionally, poly(rU) prevented the detection of polyadenylic acid.poly(dT) hybrid duplexes preformed in situ. These results raised the possibility that three-stranded structures rather than duplexes were formed in chromosomal sites. To test this hypothesis, the specificity of antibodies to triple-helical nucleic acids was reassessed employing distinct nucleic acid configurations. These antibodies were raised to the poly(dA).poly(rU).poly(rU) complex and have been used here for the first time in immunocytochemistry. Anti-triplex antibodies recognised the complex poly(dA).poly(rU).poly(rU) assembled with poly(rU) in poly(dA).poly(dT)-rich homopolymer regions of R. americana chromosomes. The antibodies could not detect short triplex stretches, suggesting the existence of constraints for triple-helix detection, probably related to triplex tract length.

Transrecombination, the hobo-induced recombination between two P{wHy} half molecules, was shown to further expand the P{wHy} mutational range, pointing to a potent, iterative process of transrecombination-reconstitution-transrecombination for alternating between very large and very fine-grained deletions in a self-contained manner.

The results show that Zeste binds to the upstream white promoter region and the enhancer that is responsible for white activation in the eyes. We have confirmed the previous finding that Zeste is not required for the activity of the eye enhancer and the promoter when they are located in close proximity to each other. However, inactivation of Zeste markedly affects the enhancer-promoter communication in transgenes when the eye enhancer and the white promoter are separated by a 3-kb spacer or the yellow gene. Zeste is also required for insulator bypass by the eye enhancer. Taken together, these results show that Zeste can support specific long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters.",2009,"Margarita Kostyuchenko, Ekaterina Savitskaya, Elizaveta Koryagina, Larisa Melnikova, Marina Karakozova, Pavel Georgiev, Margarita Kostyuchenko, Ekaterina Savitskaya, Elizaveta Koryagina, Larisa Melnikova, Marina Karakozova, Pavel Georgiev"

Transgenic Drosophila simulans strains prove the identity of the speciation gene Lethal hybrid rescue,20154422,10.1266/ggs.84.353,"Speciation genes are responsible for genetic incompatibilities in hybrids of incipient species and therefore participate in reproductive isolation leading to complete speciation. Hybrid males between Drosophila melanogaster females and D. simulans males die at late larval or prepupal stages due to a failure in chromosome condensation during mitosis. However a mutant male of D. simulans, named Lethal hybrid rescue (Lhr), produces viable hybrid males when crossed to females of D. melanogaster. Recently the Lhr gene has been proposed as corresponding to the CG18468 gene in D. melanogaster. However this identification relied on sequence characteristics more than on a precise mapping and the use of the GAL4/UAS system to drive the transgene in D. melanogaster might have increased the complexity of interaction. Thus here we propose an independent identification of the Lhr gene based on a more precise mapping and transgenic experiments in D. simulans. We have mapped the Lhr gene by using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and identified within the candidate region the gene homologous to CG18468 as the Lhr gene as it was previously reported. Transgenic experiments in D. simulans with the native promoter of CG18468 prove that it is the Lhr gene of D. simulans by inducing the lethality of the hybrid males.",2009,"StÃ©phane R Prigent, Hiroshi Matsubayashi, Masa-Toshi Yamamoto, StÃ©phane R Prigent, Hiroshi Matsubayashi, Masa-Toshi Yamamoto"
Oviposition preference for and positional avoidance of acetic acid provide a model for competing behavioral drives in Drosophila,19541615,10.1073/pnas.0901419106,"Selection of appropriate oviposition sites is essential for progeny survival and fitness in generalist insect species, such as Drosophila melanogaster, yet little is known about the mechanisms regulating how environmental conditions and innate adult preferences are evaluated and balanced to yield the final substrate choice for egg-deposition. Female D. melanogaster are attracted to food containing acetic acid (AA) as an oviposition substrate. However, our observations reveal that this egg-laying preference is a complex process, as it directly opposes an otherwise strong, default behavior of positional avoidance for the same food. We show that 2 distinct sensory modalities detect AA. Attraction to AA-containing food for the purpose of egg-laying relies on the gustatory system, while positional repulsion depends primarily on the olfactory system. Similarly, distinct central brain regions are involved in AA attraction and repulsion. Given this unique situation, in which a single environmental stimulus yields 2 opposing behavioral outputs, we propose that the interaction of egg-laying attraction and positional aversion for AA provides a powerful model for studying how organisms balance competing behavioral drives and integrate signals involved in choice-like processes.",2009,"Ryan M Joseph, Anita V Devineni, Ian F G King, Ulrike Heberlein, Ryan M Joseph, Anita V Devineni, Ian F G King, Ulrike Heberlein"
Reduced X-linked rare polymorphism in males in comparison to females of Drosophila melanogaster,18836147,10.1093/jhered/esn078,"Natural selection is assumed to act more strongly on X-linked loci than on autosomal loci because the fitness effect of a recessive mutation on the X chromosome is fully expressed in hemizygous males. Therefore, selection is expected to fix or remove recessive mutations on the X chromosome more efficiently than those on autosomes. However, the assumption that hemizygosity of the X chromosome selectively accelerates changes in allele frequency has not been confirmed directly. To examine this assumption, we investigated current natural selection on X-linked chemoreceptor genes in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster by comparing nucleotide diversity, linkage disequilibrium (LD), and departure from the neutrality in 4 chemoreceptor genes on 100 X chromosomes each from female and male flies. The general pattern of nucleotide diversity and LD for the genes investigated was similar in females and males. In contrast, males harbored significantly fewer rare polymorphisms defined as singletons and doubletons. When all the gene sequences were concatenated, Tajima's D showed a significant departure from the neutrality in both females and males, whereas Fu and Li's F* value revealed departure only in males. These results suggest that some rare polymorphisms on the X chromosome from females are recessively deleterious and are removed by stronger purifying selection when transferred to hemizygous males.",2009,"Kazuo H Takahashi, Kentaro Tanaka, Masanobu Itoh, Toshiyuki Takano-Shimizu, Kazuo H Takahashi, Kentaro Tanaka, Masanobu Itoh, Toshiyuki Takano-Shimizu"

Sixteen isolates were distinguished from the six previously described species based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. These isolates belonged to two distinct groups, which we propose each comprise previously undescribed species. Two isolates, designated A(T) and B(T), were characterized by DNA sequences of the fusA, lepA, leuS, gyrB and ileS housekeeping genes, whole-genome DNA-DNA hybridizations with their nearest relatives and utilization of substrates for metabolism. The closest phylogenetic relatives of strain A(T) are strain B(T) (86.9 % identity for the housekeeping genes) and Providencia stuartii DSM 4539(T) (86.0 % identity). The closest phylogenetic relatives of strain B(T) are strain A(T) (86.9 % identity) and P. stuartii DSM 4539(T) (86.6 % identity). The type strains of described species in this genus shared between 84.1 and 90.1 % identity for these sequences. DNA-DNA hybridization between the strain pairs A(T)-B(T), A(T)-P. stuartii DSM 4539(T) and B(T)-P. stuartii DSM 4539(T) all resulted in less than 25 % relatedness.

The newly discovered paralog gene was called Ast-CC, and the peptide which it is predicted to make was called allatostatin double C (ASTCC). Genes for both allatostatin C (ASTC) and its paralog were found in the tick Ixodes scapularis as well as dipteran, lepidopteran, coleopteran, aphidoidean and phthirapteran insect species. In addition partial or complete cDNAs derived from Ast-CCs were found in a number of species, including Drosophila melanogaster, Bombyx mori and Rhodnius prolixus. The ASTCC precursors have a second conserved peptide sequence suggesting that they may produce two biologically active peptides. The predicted precursors encoded by the Ast-CCs have some unusual features, particularly in Drosophila, where they lack a signal peptide, and have instead a peptide anchor. These unusual structural features suggest that they are perhaps expressed by cells that are not specialized in neuropeptide synthesis and that in Drosophila ASTCC may be a juxtacrine. Data from the Fly Atlas project show that in Drosophila Ast-CC is little expressed. Nevertheless a P-element insertion in this gene is embryonic lethal, suggesting that it is an essential gene. Similarity between the precursors and receptors of ASTC/ASTCC and somatostatin suggests that ASTC/ASTCC and somatostatin have a common ancestor.",2009,"Jan A Veenstra, Jan A Veenstra"

The scale of the problem is an order of magnitude above the most complex of the current simulation projects, and it is further constrained by the relative sparsity of available electrophysiological recordings from the fly nervous system. However, fly brain research at the anatomical and behavioural levels offers some interesting opportunities that could be exploited to create a functional simulation.

Effects of chromosomal rearrangements on transvection at the yellow gene of Drosophila melanogaster,19667134,10.1534/genetics.109.106559,"Homologous chromosomes are paired in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster. This pairing can lead to transvection, which is a process by which the proximity of homologous genes can lead to a change in gene expression. At the yellow gene, transvection is the basis for several examples of intragenic complementation involving the enhancers of one allele acting in trans on the promoter of a paired second allele. Using complementation as our assay, we explored the chromosomal requirements for pairing and transvection at yellow. Following a protocol established by Ed Lewis, we generated and characterized chromosomal rearrangements to define a region in cis to yellow that must remain intact for complementation to occur. Our data indicate that homolog pairing at yellow is efficient, as complementation was disrupted only in the presence of chromosomal rearrangements that break<or=650 kbp from yellow. We also found that three telomerically placed chromosomal duplications, containing approximately 700 or more kbp of the yellow genomic region, are able to alter complementation at yellow, presumably through competitive pairing interactions. These results provide a formal demonstration of the pairing-dependent nature of yellow transvection and suggest that yellow pairing, as measured by transvection, reflects the extent of contiguous homology flanking the locus.",2009,"Sharon A Ou, Elaine Chang, Szexian Lee, Katherine So, C-ting Wu, James R Morris, Sharon A Ou, Elaine Chang, Szexian Lee, Katherine So, C-ting Wu, James R Morris"

"Localization of P elements, copy number regulation, and cytotype determination in Drosophila melanogaster",2172082,10.1017/s0016672300028822,"Seventeen highly-inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster extracted from an M' strain (in the P/M system of hybrid dysgenesis) were studied for their cytotype and the number and chromosomal location of complete and defective P elements. While most lines were of M cytotype, three presented a P cytotype (the condition that represses P-element activity) and one was intermediate between M and P. All lines were found to possess KP elements and only eight to bear full-sized P elements. Only the lines with full-sized P elements showed detectable changes in their P-insertion pattern over generations; their rates of gain and of loss of P-element sites were equal to 0.12 and 0.09 per genome, per generation, respectively. There was no correlation between these two rates within lines, suggesting independent transpositions and excisions in the inbred genomes. The results of both Southern blot analysis and in situ hybridization of probes made from left and right sides of the P element strongly suggested the presence of a putative complete P element in region 1A of the X chromosome in the three lines with a P cytotype; the absence of P copy in this 1A region in lines with an M cytotype, favours the hypothesis that the P element inserted in 1A could play a major role in the P-cytotype determination. Insertion of a defective 2 kb P element was also observed in region 93F in 9 of the 13 M lines.

Transvection in the Ultrabithorax domain of the bithorax complex of Drosophila melanogaster,2116352,,"The phenotypes of several heterozygous combinations of mutations which map within the Ultrabithorax gene of Drosophila melanogaster are modulated by the extent of somatic homologous chromosome pairing, an effect known as transvection. One can discriminate between otherwise phenotypically similar mutations via their transvection behavior. This suggested the existence of previously undetected intragenic functional units. A collection of mutations has been classified into ""transvection groups"" (in analogy to complementation groups) on the basis of transvection tests with bithorax34e, postbithorax2, and Contrabithorax1 Ultrabithorax1. The conditions necessary for each transvection effect were determined from these transvection groups. The bithorax34e mutation only transvects with Ultrabithorax mutations with a contiguous Ultrabithorax transcriptional unit. In contrast, postbithorax2 transvection requires the distal part of the bithoraxoid region. As expected, Ultrabithorax mutations do not transvect with Contrabithorax1 Ultrabithorax1. However, it appears that this cross activation is not mediated solely through one of the known regulatory regions as mutations in these regions do not consistently block the response.",1990,"D Mathog, D Mathog"
The Passover locus in Drosophila melanogaster: complex complementation and different effects on the giant fiber neural pathway,2127576,,"Drosophila melanogaster bearing the Passover mutation fail to jump in response to a light-off stimulus. Pas also disrupts some of the synapses between the neurons of the giant fiber system which mediate this escape behavior. We have mapped Pas to the 19E subdivision of the polytene X chromosome. Our genetic analyses reveal that deletions of either of two nonoverlapping regions fail to fully complement Pas. Heterozygotes of Pas with chromosomal deletions in the vicinity of polytene band 19E3 exhibit the full set of neuronal defects shown by Pas homozygotes. Alleles of the R-9-29 complementation group, which maps to band 19E3, exhibit a complex pattern of complementation with Pas. Heterozygotes combining the lethal R-9-29 alleles with Pas are all viable, some complement the neuronal defects of Pas, but most exhibit these defects. The viable shaking-B2 mutation also fails to complement Pas, the R-9-29 alleles or the 19E3 deficiencies. The R-9-29 locus may contain two functional domains, one required for viability the other for normal neuronal phenotype, trans-Heterozygotes bearing mutant alleles or a deficiency of the first region (19E3) together with deficiencies of the second region (19E5-6) also exhibit some of the neuronal defects shown by the Passover mutant. Deficiencies which delete the entire 19E3 to 19E6 interval do not produce this phenotype when heterozygous with a normal X chromosome. Thus normal function requires a cis-interaction between the two regions. These findings raise the possibility that the gene mutated by Pas is split or separated from a cis-activator by at least one other gene.",1990,"D H Baird, A P Schalet, R J Wyman, D H Baird, A P Schalet, R J Wyman"
The biometrical genetics of competitive parameters in Drosophila melanogaster,2111300,10.1038/hdy.1990.27,"Despite the importance of competition as an evolutionary determinant in natural populations there have been few studies of the genetical control of competitive ability. Here, we report the results of a biometrical analysis of four continuously varying traits which, between them, describe the competitive interactions in mixed cultures of Drosophila melanogaster. The analysis involved the parental, F1, F2 and backcross generations (including all reciprocals) derived from crosses between two highly inbred lines isolated from the Texas population of D. melanogaster. The competitive performance of each genotype in monoculture and in duoculture with a phenotypically distinct tester were assessed using a yield-density regression analysis. Appropriate genetic models were fitted using a variance weighted least squares procedure and the resulting genetic components of the generation means used to define the genetical architecture of competition. Of the four competitive parameters investigated here the e-value, which describes the competitive performance of the indicator genotype at a fixed reference density, was found to be determined by simple additive genetic effects with no evidence of significant dominance. Conversely, competitive performance in monoculture (intra-genotypic competition) did display a significant net dominance component and the observed values in the F1 and parental generations indicated some degree of heterosis. Of the two competitive parameters determining performance in duoculture (inter-genotypic sensitivity and inter-genotypic pressure) the former was found to have a complex genetic determination involving not only additive and dominance components of the progeny's own genotype but also dominance components of the F1 maternal genotypes. There were also additive-dominance and dominance-dominance non-allelic interactions. Heterosis was evident, determined both by the progeny's own genotype and by one of the F1 maternal genotypes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1990,"M Hemmat, P Eggleston, M Hemmat, P Eggleston"
Mosaic pattern of X-chromosomal transcription in a strain of Drosophila melanogaster with aneuploid X chromosome,2115019,,"Organisation and template activity pattern of salivary gland chromosomes of a segmental male aneuploid of D. melanogaster, carrying duplication for the segment 8C-20F of X chromosome, have been examined by in situ transcription. In an earlier study [Chatterjee, Chromosoma 91 (1985) 259], it was suggested that in male aneuploids, up to an additional length of 8C-20F, the template activity of X chromosome tends to remain at a male level and beyond that level shifts towards female level. A large scale search of the template activity pattern of the aneuploid carrying dp.(8C-20F) clearly indicates that presence of the duplication fragment to X in the normal karyotype (1X2A) lead to a varying degree of condensation of euchromatic regions of entire X chromosome (X + X fragment 8C-20F) starting from 'male' level, over a wide range of 'intermediate' level to a normal 'female' level. In this study, the individual cells of the aneuploid appeared to display their own state of X condensation and transcription. Although in the aneuploid, X chromosomal activity is not determined by a purely quantitative effect of X vs. autosomal material (X:A ratio = 0.81), the 8C-20F segment of X chromosome must contain some major elements concerned with the signal given by X:A ratio for X chromosome differentiation.",1990,"R N Chatterjee, R N Chatterjee"
A rapid cold-hardening response protecting against cold shock injury in Drosophila melanogaster,2106564,,"In studies of insect cold-hardiness, the supercooling point (SCP) is defined as the temperature at which spontaneous nucleation of body fluids occurs. Despite having an SCP of -20 degrees C, adults of Drosophila melanogaster did not survive exposure to -5 degrees C, which suggests that cold shock causes lethal injury that is not associated with freezing. If, however, flies were chilled at 5 degrees C, for as little as 30 min, approximately 50% of the flies survived exposure to -5 degrees C for 2h. This capacity to cold-harden rapidly was greatest in 3- and 5-day-old adults. The rapid cold-hardening response was also observed in larvae and pupae: no larvae survived 2 h of exposure to -5 degrees C, whereas 63% pupariated if chilled at 5 degrees C before subzero exposure. Similarly, although exposure of pupae to -8 degrees C was lethal, if pre-chilled at 5 degrees C 22% eclosed.

Results suggest the relatively recent divergence of the Fast allozyme from the Slow allozyme. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity was measured as a phenotype of the Zw locus. A significant difference in G6PD activity between allozymes was detected. The between-line effect was highly significant within the Slow allozyme, but was not significant within the Fast allozyme.

Molecular genetics of a three-gene cluster in the Amy region of Drosophila,1697417,,"Analysis of amylase RNA levels in the anterior and posterior midgut regions of flies from the Amy1,6 mapA and c Amy2,3 mapC strains of D. melanogaster, reared on yeast and on yeast supplemented with glucose, indicates that the trans-acting map gene controls the abundance of amylase RNA tissue-specifically, i.e., in the adult posterior midgut. This is consistent with the view that its role in controlling Amy expression is that of a transcription factor. Dietary glucose represses Amy expression in the anterior and posterior midgut regions of adults, reducing the abundance of amylase RNA, which suggests that it also controls Amy transcriptional activity. However, the mechanism for glucose repression appears to act systemically in the midgut, in a manner that is independent of the effects of map on Amy expression. A new glucose repressible TU was identified that is located just proximal to the Amy locus in region 54A of polytene chromosome 2R. It is transcribed in the direction opposite to that of the proximal Amy gene and encodes an RNA about 1500 bases long. Its RNA is expressed in both larvae and adults of the above strains of D. melanogaster, but the nature of the product it encodes is unknown. We speculate that all three genes in the cluster at 54A, namely the two Amy gene copies and the new glucose repressible TU, are coordinately controlled by the same mechanism that regulates Amy gene expression in response to dietary glucose. Somatic transformation experiments suggest that 5' cis-regulatory mechanisms required for the correct spatial expression of the proximal and distal Amylase genes from a Canton-S strain of D. melanogaster, Amy-p1 and Amy-d3, are located within 450 bp and 463 bp of their respective translation start sites. These regions also contain sequences responsive to dietary glucose repression, which is mediated at the DNA level of exogenous Amy genes in somatically transformed larvae reared on a yeast + glucose diet. A positive activator is located in the upstream region of Amy-d3 between the nucleotide pairs at -365 and -252 from the translation start site, but a comparable activator does not appear to exist in the upstream region of Amy-p1. Deletion analysis of the 5' sequence flanking the coding region of Amy-d3 indicates 125 nucleotide pairs of flanking DNA is sufficient for its functional activity. A model is proposed for coordinate control, in part, of the duplicated Amy genes.",1990,"W W Doane, D B Thompson, R A Norman, S A Hawley, W W Doane, D B Thompson, R A Norman, S A Hawley"
Genetic evidence that the ovo locus is involved in Drosophila germ line sex determination,2116356,,"Zygotically contributed ovo gene product is required for the survival of female germ cells in Drosophila melanogaster. Trans-allelic combinations of weak and dominant ovo mutations (ovoD) result in viable germ cells that appear to be partially transformed from female to male sexual identity. The ovoD2 mutation is partially suppressed by many Sex-lethal alleles that affect the soma, while those that affect only the germ line fail to interact with ovoD2. One of two loss-of-function ovo alleles is suppressed by a loss-of-function Sex-lethal allele. Because ovo mutations are germ line dependent, it is likely that ovo is suppressed by way of communication between the somatic and germ lines. A loss-of-function allele of ovo is epistatic to germ line dependent mutations in Sex-lethal. The germ line dependent sex determination mutation, sans fille, and ovoD mutations show a dominant synergistic interaction resulting in partial transformation of germ line sexual identity. The ovo locus appears to be involved in germ line sex determination and is linked in some manner to sex determination in the soma.",1990,"B Oliver, D Pauli, A P Mahowald, B Oliver, D Pauli, A P Mahowald"

An unusual Y chromosome of Drosophila simulans carrying amplified rDNA spacer without rRNA genes,2379820,,"The X and Y chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster each contain a cluster of several hundred ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA). A nontranscribed spacer region separates adjacent rRNA genes and contains tandem copies of 240 bp repeats that include the initiation site for RNA polymerase I transcription. We show here that Drosophila simulans, a sibling species of D. melanogaster, contains few, if any, rRNA genes on its Y chromosome but carries instead a large block (3,000 kb or 12,500 copies) of 240 bp nontranscribed spacer repeats. The repeats are located at the tip of the long arm of the simulans Y chromosome, in contrast to their location among rRNA genes on the short arm of the Y chromosome of D. melanogaster. The bobbed mutation in homozygous females of D. melanogaster shortens and thins the bristles, owing to a partial deletion of rRNA genes on the X chromosome. The bristles of bobbed/Y males are normal owing to the presence of a full complement of rRNA genes on the Y chromosome. Peculiarly, in bobbed/Y males of D. simulans the short bristle phenotype does not return to normal but is enhanced by the presence of the Y chromosome. We propose that the 12,500 nontranscribed spacer repeats on the Y chromosome are responsible for this biological effect by competition for a protein factor(s) essential for normal levels of rDNA transcription at the X-linked locus.",1990,"A R Lohe, P A Roberts, A R Lohe, P A Roberts"
Rat homologs of the Drosophila dunce gene code for cyclic AMP phosphodiesterases sensitive to rolipram and RO 20-1724,2153912,,"The dunce locus of Drosophila melanogaster codes for a low Km, cAMP phosphodiesterase. The correct function of this gene is required for normal learning and memory activity in flies, because dunce mutants fail in tests of behavioral conditioning. These observations have indicated that cAMP regulation is an important aspect of the biochemistry underlying learning and memory processes in insects. To determine whether the locus is functionally conserved in mammals, we have expressed dunce gene homologs from the rat in a yeast expression system. We find that the rat homologs encode low Km, cAMP phosphodiesterases similar to that coded for by the Drosophila dunce+ gene and, more importantly, that the mammalian enzymes are inhibited by rolipram and RO 20-1724, drugs with antidepressant properties. Surprisingly, the dunce-encoded phosphodiesterase was not inhibited by rolipram or RO 20-1724. These findings suggest that the phosphodiesterases, through their regulation of cAMP levels, influence learning and memory in insects and mood in mammals.",1990,"J Henkel-Tigges, R L Davis, J Henkel-Tigges, R L Davis"
Developmental expression of the glucose dehydrogenase gene in Drosophila melanogaster,2108903,,"The Gld gene of Drosophila melanogaster is transiently expressed during every stage of development. The temporal pattern of Gld expression is highly correlated with that of ecdysteroids. Exogeneous treatment of third instar larvae with 20-hydroxyecdysone induces the accumulation of Gld mRNA in the hypoderm and anterior spiracular gland cells. During metamorphosis Gld is expressed in a variety of tissues derived from the ectoderm. In the developing reproductive tract, Gld mRNA accumulates in the female spermathecae and oviduct and in the male ejaculatory duct and ejaculatory bulb. These four organs are derived from closely related cell lineages in the genital imaginal disc. Since the expression of Gld is not required for the development of these reproductive structures, this spatial pattern of expression is most likely a fortuitous consequence of a shared regulatory factor in this cell lineage. At the adult stage a high level of the Gld mRNA is only observed in the male ejaculatory duct.",1990,"D L Cox-Foster, C P Schonbaum, M T Murtha, D R Cavener, D L Cox-Foster, C P Schonbaum, M T Murtha, D R Cavener"

We also show that a fourth flightless mutation, termed grounded, previously mapped near to the base of the X-chromosome, is distal to the cytogenetic interval 18F to 20F. Mutants homozygous for the flightless-I3, flightless-O2 and standby mutations exhibit abnormalities of myofibrillar arrangements in the indirect flight muscles.

Fruitless alternative splicing and sex behaviour in insects: an ancient and unforgettable love story?,20876995,10.1007/s12041-010-0040-z,"Courtship behaviours are common features of animal species that reproduce sexually. Typically, males are involved in courting females. Insects display an astonishing variety of courtship strategies primarily based on innate stereotyped responses to various external stimuli. In Drosophila melanogaster, male courtship requires proteins encoded by the fruitless (fru) gene that are produced in different sex-specific isoforms via alternative splicing. Drosophila mutant flies with loss-of-function alleles of the fru gene exhibit blocked male courtship behaviour. However, various individual steps in the courtship ritual are disrupted in fly strains carrying different fru alleles. These findings suggest that fru is required for specific steps in courtship. In distantly related insect species, various fru paralogues were isolated, which shows conservation of sex-specific alternative splicing and protein expression in neural tissues and suggests an evolutionary functional conservation of fru in the control of male-specific courtship behaviour. In this review, we report the seminal findings regarding the fru gene, its splicing regulation and evolution in insects.",2010,"Marco Salvemini, Catello Polito, Giuseppe Saccone, Marco Salvemini, Catello Polito, Giuseppe Saccone"
Commensal bacteria play a role in mating preference of Drosophila melanogaster,21041648,10.1073/pnas.1009906107,"Development of mating preference is considered to be an early event in speciation. In this study, mating preference was achieved by dividing a population of Drosophila melanogaster and rearing one part on a molasses medium and the other on a starch medium. When the isolated populations were mixed, ""molasses flies"" preferred to mate with other molasses flies and ""starch flies"" preferred to mate with other starch flies. The mating preference appeared after only one generation and was maintained for at least 37 generations. Antibiotic treatment abolished mating preference, suggesting that the fly microbiota was responsible for the phenomenon. This was confirmed by infection experiments with microbiota obtained from the fly media (before antibiotic treatment) as well as with a mixed culture of Lactobacillus species and a pure culture of Lactobacillus plantarum isolated from starch flies. Analytical data suggest that symbiotic bacteria can influence mating preference by changing the levels of cuticular hydrocarbon sex pheromones.

A sequence motif enriched in regions bound by the Drosophila dosage compensation complex,20226017,10.1186/1471-2164-11-169,"Background:
      
    

    
      In Drosophila melanogaster, dosage compensation is mediated by the action of the dosage compensation complex (DCC). How the DCC recognizes the fly X chromosome is still poorly understood. Characteristic sequence signatures at all DCC binding sites have not hitherto been found.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In this study, we compare the known binding sites of the DCC with oligonucleotide profiles that measure the specificity of the sequences of the D. melanogaster X chromosome. We show that the X chromosome regions bound by the DCC are enriched for a particular type of short, repetitive sequences. Their distribution suggests that these sequences contribute to chromosome recognition, the generation of DCC binding sites and/or the local spreading of the complex. Comparative data indicate that the same sequences may be involved in dosage compensation in other Drosophila species.

Immunocytochemical localization of synaptic proteins to photoreceptor synapses of Drosophila melanogaster,20127822,10.1002/cne.22268,"The location of proteins that contribute to synaptic function has been widely studied in vertebrate synapses, far more than at model synapses of the genetically manipulable fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila photoreceptor terminals have been extensively exploited to characterize the actions of synaptic genes, and their distinct and repetitive synaptic ultrastructure is anatomically well suited for such studies. Synaptic release sites include a bipartite T-bar ribbon, comprising a platform surmounting a pedestal. So far, little is known about the composition and precise location of proteins at either the T-bar ribbon or its associated synaptic organelles, knowledge of which is required to understand many details of synaptic function. We studied the localization of candidate proteins to pre- or postsynaptic organelles, by using immuno-electron microscopy with the pre-embedding method, after first validating immunolabeling by confocal microscopy. We used monoclonal antibodies against Bruchpilot, epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate clone 15 (EPS-15), and cysteine string protein (CSP), all raised against a fly head homogenate, as well as sea urchin kinesin (antibody SUK4) and Discs large (DLG). All these antibodies labeled distinct synaptic structures in photoreceptor terminals in the first optic neuropil, the lamina, as did rabbit anti-DPAK (Drosophila p21 activated kinase) and anti-Dynamin. Validating reports from light microscopy, immunoreactivity to Bruchpilot localized to the edge of the platform, and immunoreactivity to SUK4 localized to the pedestal of the T-bar ribbon. Anti-DLG recognized the photoreceptor head of capitate projections, invaginating organelles from surrounding glia. For synaptic vesicles, immunoreactivity to EPS-15 localized to sites of endocytosis, and anti-CSP labeled vesicles lying close to the T-bar ribbon.

The H3K27me3 demethylase dUTX is a suppressor of Notch- and Rb-dependent tumors in Drosophila,20212086,10.1128/MCB.01633-09,"Trimethylated lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) is an epigenetic mark for gene silencing and can be demethylated by the JmjC domain of UTX. Excessive H3K27me3 levels can cause tumorigenesis, but little is known about the mechanisms leading to those cancers. Mutants of the Drosophila H3K27me3 demethylase dUTX display some characteristics of Trithorax group mutants and have increased H3K27me3 levels in vivo. Surprisingly, dUTX mutations also affect H3K4me1 levels in a JmjC-independent manner. We show that a disruption of the JmjC domain of dUTX results in a growth advantage for mutant cells over adjacent wild-type tissue due to increased proliferation. The growth advantage of dUTX mutant tissue is caused, at least in part, by increased Notch activity, demonstrating that dUTX is a Notch antagonist. Furthermore, the inactivation of Retinoblastoma (Rbf in Drosophila) contributes to the growth advantage of dUTX mutant tissue. The excessive activation of Notch in dUTX mutant cells leads to tumor-like growth in an Rbf-dependent manner. In summary, these data suggest that dUTX is a suppressor of Notch- and Rbf-dependent tumors in Drosophila melanogaster and may provide a model for UTX-dependent tumorigenesis in humans.",2010,"Hans-Martin Herz, Laurence D Madden, Zhihong Chen, Clare Bolduc, Eugene Buff, Ravi Gupta, Ramana Davuluri, Ali Shilatifard, Iswar K Hariharan, Andreas Bergmann, Hans-Martin Herz, Laurence D Madden, Zhihong Chen, Clare Bolduc, Eugene Buff, Ravi Gupta, Ramana Davuluri, Ali Shilatifard, Iswar K Hariharan, Andreas Bergmann"

The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster provides a simpler model system for studying complex cellular and genetic interactions that lead to tumor formation and progression. The paper from Marcos Vidal's group shows that both the tumor-suppressing and tumor-promoting roles of TNF are conserved in Drosophila, and that oncogenic Ras is the switch.

FISH mapping of microsatellite loci from Drosophila subobscura and its comparison to related species,20198419,10.1007/s10577-010-9112-4,"Microsatellites are highly polymorphic markers that are distributed through all the genome being more abundant in non-coding regions. Whether they are neutral or under selection, these markers if localized can be used as co-dominant molecular markers to explore the dynamics of the evolutionary processes. Their cytological localization can allow identifying genes under selection, inferring recombination from a genomic point of view, or screening for the genomic reorganizations occurring during the evolution of a lineage, among others. In this paper, we report for the first time the localization of microsatellite loci by fluorescent in situ hybridization on Drosophila polytene chromosomes. In Drosophila subobscura, 72 dinucleotide microsatellite loci were localized by fluorescent in situ hybridization yielding unique hybridization signals. In the sex chromosome, microsatellite distribution was not uniform and its density was higher than in autosomes. We identified homologous segments to the sequence flanking the microsatellite loci by browsing the genome sequence of Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila melanogaster. Their localization supports the conservation of Muller's chromosomal elements among Drosophila species and the existence of multiple intrachromosomal rearrangements within each evolutionary lineage. Finally, the lack of microsatellite repeats in the homologous D. melanogaster sequences suggests convergent evolution for high microsatellite density in the distal part of the X chromosome.",2010,"Josiane Santos, Lluis Serra, Elisabet SolÃ©, Marta Pascual, Josiane Santos, Lluis Serra, Elisabet SolÃ©, Marta Pascual"

Drosophila Ana2 is a conserved centriole duplication factor,20123993,10.1083/jcb.200910016,"In Caenorhabditis elegans, five proteins are required for centriole duplication: SPD-2, ZYG-1, SAS-5, SAS-6, and SAS-4.

Strikingly, all three fly proteins can induce the de novo formation of centriole-like structures when overexpressed in unfertilized eggs. Here, we find that of eight candidate duplication factors identified in cultured fly cells, only two, Ana2 and Asterless (Asl), share this ability. Asl is now known to be essential for centriole duplication in flies, but no equivalent protein has been found in worms. We show that Ana2 is the likely functional orthologue of SAS-5 and that it is also related to the vertebrate STIL/SIL protein family that has been linked to microcephaly in humans.

The sexually antagonistic genes of Drosophila melanogaster,20305719,10.1371/journal.pbio.1000335,"When selective pressures differ between males and females, the genes experiencing these conflicting evolutionary forces are said to be sexually antagonistic.

Here, by combining data on sex-specific fitness and genome-wide transcript abundance in a quantitative genetic framework, we identified a group of candidate genes experiencing sexually antagonistic selection in the adult, which correspond to 8% of Drosophila melanogaster genes. As predicted, the X chromosome is enriched for these genes, but surprisingly they represent only a small proportion of the total number of sex-biased transcripts, indicating that the latter is a poor predictor of sexual antagonism. Furthermore, the majority of genes whose expression profiles showed a significant relationship with either male or female adult fitness are also sexually antagonistic.

RhoL controls invasion and Rap1 localization during immune cell transmigration in Drosophila,20495554,10.1038/ncb2063,"Human immune cells have to penetrate an endothelial barrier during their beneficial pursuit of infection and their destructive infiltration of tissues in autoimmune diseases.

We define a new model system for this process by demonstrating, with live imaging and genetics, that during embryonic development Drosophila melanogaster immune cells penetrate an epithelial, Drosophila E-cadherin (DE-cadherin)-based tissue barrier. A mutant in RhoL, a GTPase homologue that is specifically expressed in haemocytes, blocks this invasive step but not other aspects of guided migration. RhoL mediates integrin adhesion caused by Drosophila Rap1 overexpression and moves Rap1 away from a concentration in the cytoplasm to the leading edge during invasive migration. These findings indicate that a programmed migratory step during Drosophila development bears striking molecular similarities to vertebrate immune cell transmigration during inflammation, and identify RhoL as a new regulator of invasion, adhesion and Rap1 localization.

Patterns and processes of genome-wide divergence between North American and African Drosophila melanogaster,20551441,10.1534/genetics.110.117366,"Genomic tools and analyses are now being widely used to understand genome-wide patterns and processes associated with speciation and adaptation. In this article, we apply a genomics approach to the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. This species originated in Africa and subsequently spread and adapted to temperate environments of Eurasia and the New World, leading some populations to evolve reproductive isolation, especially between cosmopolitan and Zimbabwean populations. We used tiling arrays to identify highly differentiated regions within and between North America (the United States and Caribbean) and Africa (Cameroon and Zimbabwe) across 63% of the D. melanogaster genome and then sequenced representative fragments to study their genetic divergence. Consistent with previous findings, our results showed that most differentiation was between populations living in Africa vs. outside of Africa (i.e., ""out-of-Africa"" divergence), with all other geographic differences being less substantial (e.g., between cosmopolitan and Zimbabwean races). The X chromosome was much more strongly differentiated than the autosomes between North American and African populations (i.e., greater X divergence). Overall differentiation was positively associated with recombination rates across chromosomes, with a sharp reduction in regions near centromeres. Fragments surrounding these high F(ST) sites showed reduced haplotype diversity and increased frequency of rare and derived alleles in North American populations compared to African populations. Nevertheless, despite sharp deviation from neutrality in North American strains, a small set of bottleneck/expansion demographic models was consistent with patterns of variation at the majority of our high F(ST) fragments. Although North American populations were more genetically variable compared to Europe, our simulation results were generally consistent with those previously based on European samples. These findings support the hypothesis that most differentiation between North America and Africa was likely driven by the sorting of African standing genetic variation into the New World via Europe. Finally, a few exceptional loci were identified, highlighting the need to use an appropriate demographic null model to identify possible cases of selective sweeps in species with complex demographic histories.",2010,"Roman Yukilevich, Thomas L Turner, Fumio Aoki, Sergey V Nuzhdin, John R True, Roman Yukilevich, Thomas L Turner, Fumio Aoki, Sergey V Nuzhdin, John R True"
The shaping of male courtship posture by lateralized gustatory inputs to male-specific interneurons,20036540,10.1016/j.cub.2009.11.038,"Background:
      
    

    
      Unilateral wing vibration to generate ""love songs"" is a hallmark of male courtship posture in Drosophila melanogaster. In contrast, males of some other Drosophila species extend both wings simultaneously during courtship. Thus, the patterns of wing movement vary among species and are under stringent genetic control, although there are few variations among individuals within a single species. These observations prompted the postulation that the proper wing display by courting males of D. melanogaster does not require sensory inputs.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here we show that when males of D. melanogaster are deprived of gustatory inputs mediated by the sensory neurons expressing the taste receptor gene Gr32a, a close relative to the pheromone receptor gene Gr68a, they often fail to perform unilateral wing extension during courtship because they become unable to keep a wing in the resting position while extending another wing. The tarsal amputation of a foreleg, but not other legs, increased the occurrence of simultaneous wing extension, indicating that Gr32a-expressing cells in this structure are involved in the regulation of courting posture. A similar simultaneous wing extension was also observed in males in which the putative pheromone-binding protein gene Obp57d was inactivated. The axons of Gr32a-expressing cells project to the subesophageal ganglion, where their terminals unilaterally contact mAL, which are male-specific fruitless (fru)-expressing interneurons that have bilateral branches.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:

Drosophila melanogaster in the study of human neurodegeneration,20522007,10.2174/187152710791556104,"Human neurodegenerative diseases are devastating illnesses that predominantly affect elderly people. The majority of the diseases are associated with pathogenic oligomers from misfolded proteins, eventually causing the formation of aggregates and the progressive loss of neurons in the brain and nervous system. Several of these proteinopathies are sporadic and the cause of pathogenesis remains elusive. Heritable forms are associated with genetic defects, suggesting that the affected protein is causally related to disease formation and/or progression. The limitations of human genetics, however, make it necessary to use model systems to analyse affected genes and pathways in more detail. During the last two decades, research using the genetically amenable fruitfly has established Drosophila melanogaster as a valuable model system in the study of human neurodegeneration. These studies offer reliable models for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and motor neuron diseases, as well as models for trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases, including ataxias and Huntington's disease. As a result of these studies, several signalling pathways including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and target of rapamycin (TOR), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling, have been shown to be deregulated in models of proteinopathies, suggesting that two or more initiating events may trigger disease formation in an age-related manner. Moreover, these studies also demonstrate that the fruitfly can be used to screen chemical compounds for their potential to prevent or ameliorate the disease, which in turn can directly guide clinical research and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of human neurodegenerative diseases.",2010,"Frank Hirth, Frank Hirth"
[Change in the distribution of transposable elements in isogenic strain--cause or consequence in Drosophila melanogaster selection for quantitative traits?],20737907,,"The distribution patterns pf hobo transposon and Dm412 retrotransposon hybridization sites on the salivary gland polytene chromosomes from the larvae of Drosophila melanogaster isogenic strain 51, used for analyzing the effect of transposable element (TE) transposition on the selection for quantitative traits, were studied, It was demonstrated that at least half Dm412 hybridization sites were retained 15 years after isogenization; the frequency of Dm412 transposition varied from 2.0 x 10(-4) to 8.8 x 10(-5) depending on whether the appearance of the same hybridization sites in some individuals were regarded as independent events or as a manifestation of the sample heterogeneity. The distribution patterns of hobo hybridization sites in two isofemale strains derived from isogenic strain 51 differed more noticeably: the number of hobo sites in one of the derivative strains was threefold smaller than in another and only a fraction of the sites was common. Within each derivative strain, the TE distribution was uniform, suggesting that inbreeding had no effect on the Dm412 activity in this strain. The rates of change in the distribution patterns of various TEs in strain 51 corresponded to their spontaneous transposition rates. As isogenic strain accumulates the polymorphism in TE distribution without selection, the TEs are more likely to be the markers of selection events than their inducers. Thus, when studying the effects of various environmental factors on TE transposition even in isogenic strains, it is necessary to perform rounds of close inbreeding to reduce the potential polymorphism.",2010,"L P Zakharenko, M P Perepelkina, L A Vasil'eva, L P Zakharenko, M P Perepelkina, L A Vasil'eva"
Interaction between Ras(V12) and scribbled clones induces tumour growth and invasion,20072127,10.1038/nature08702,"Human tumours have a large degree of cellular and genetic heterogeneity. Complex cell interactions in the tumour and its microenvironment are thought to have an important role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Furthermore, cooperation between oncogenic genetic lesions is required for tumour development; however, it is not known how cell interactions contribute to oncogenic cooperation. The genetic techniques available in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster allow analysis of the behaviour of cells with distinct mutations, making this the ideal model organism with which to study cell interactions and oncogenic cooperation. In Drosophila eye-antennal discs, cooperation between the oncogenic protein Ras(V12) (ref. 5) and loss-of-function mutations in the conserved tumour suppressor scribbled (scrib) gives rise to metastatic tumours that display many characteristics observed in human cancers. Here we show that clones of cells bearing different mutations can cooperate to promote tumour growth and invasion in Drosophila. We found that the Ras(V12) and scrib(-) mutations can also cause tumours when they affect different adjacent epithelial cells. We show that this interaction between Ras(V12) and scrib(-) clones involves JNK signalling propagation and JNK-induced upregulation of JAK/STAT-activating cytokines, a compensatory growth mechanism for tissue homeostasis. The development of Ras(V12) tumours can also be triggered by tissue damage, a stress condition that activates JNK signalling. Given the conservation of the pathways examined here, similar cooperative mechanisms could have a role in the development of human cancers.",2010,"Ming Wu, JosÃ© Carlos Pastor-Pareja, Tian Xu, Ming Wu, JosÃ© Carlos Pastor-Pareja, Tian Xu"
Dietary restriction affects lifespan but not cognitive aging in Drosophila melanogaster,20156204,10.1111/j.1474-9726.2010.00560.x,"Dietary restriction extends lifespan in a wide variety of animals, including Drosophila, but its relationship to functional and cognitive aging is unclear. Here, we study the effects of dietary yeast content on fly performance in an aversive learning task (association between odor and mechanical shock). Learning performance declined at old age, but 50-day-old dietary-restricted flies learned as poorly as equal-aged flies maintained on yeast-rich diet, even though the former lived on average 9 days (14%) longer. Furthermore, at the middle age of 21 days, flies on low-yeast diets showed poorer short-term (5 min) memory than flies on rich diet. In contrast, dietary restriction enhanced 60-min memory of young (5 days old) flies. Thus, while dietary restriction had complex effects on learning performance in young to middle-aged flies, it did not attenuate aging-related decline of aversive learning performance. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that, in Drosophila, dietary restriction reduces mortality and thus leads to lifespan extension, but does not affect the rate with which somatic damage relevant for cognitive performance accumulates with age.",2010,"Joep M S Burger, SÃ©verine D Buechel, Tadeusz J Kawecki, Joep M S Burger, SÃ©verine D Buechel, Tadeusz J Kawecki"
Reduction of protein translation and activation of autophagy protect against PINK1 pathogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,21151574,10.1371/journal.pgen.1001237,"Mutations in PINK1 and Parkin cause familial, early onset Parkinson's disease. In Drosophila melanogaster, PINK1 and Parkin mutants show similar phenotypes, such as swollen and dysfunctional mitochondria, muscle degeneration, energy depletion, and dopaminergic (DA) neuron loss. We previously showed that PINK1 and Parkin genetically interact with the mitochondrial fusion/fission pathway, and PINK1 and Parkin were recently proposed to form a mitochondrial quality control system that involves mitophagy. However, the in vivo relationships among PINK1/Parkin function, mitochondrial fission/fusion, and autophagy remain unclear; and other cellular events critical for PINK1 pathogenesis remain to be identified. Here we show that PINK1 genetically interacted with the protein translation pathway. Enhanced translation through S6K activation significantly exacerbated PINK1 mutant phenotypes, whereas reduction of translation showed suppression. Induction of autophagy by Atg1 overexpression also rescued PINK1 mutant phenotypes, even in the presence of activated S6K. Downregulation of translation and activation of autophagy were already manifested in PINK1 mutant, suggesting that they represent compensatory cellular responses to mitochondrial dysfunction caused by PINK1 inactivation, presumably serving to conserve energy. Interestingly, the enhanced PINK1 mutant phenotype in the presence of activated S6K could be fully rescued by Parkin, apparently in an autophagy-independent manner. Our results reveal complex cellular responses to PINK1 inactivation and suggest novel therapeutic strategies through manipulation of the compensatory responses.",2010,"Song Liu, Bingwei Lu, Song Liu, Bingwei Lu"
Mitochondrial electron transport chain dysfunction during development does not extend lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster,20096722,10.1016/j.mad.2010.01.004,"Since the initial identification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the major factor in aging, many studies have provided evidence for the central role of mitochondria in longevity. A few years ago, an unexpected finding showed that the inactivation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) in Caenorhabditis elegans, during the developmental stages only, extended lifespan. Activation of this mitochondrial pathway affecting aging (MIT) is associated with several phenotypic features: increased longevity, increased time of development, decreased fertility/fecundity and reduced adult size. Here, we investigated this pathway in another model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. To assess the role of mitochondrial activity in the Drosophila aging process, we partially inactivated the MRC using RNA interference (RNAi) during larval stages. Developmental perturbation of the respiratory process prolonged development, increased lethality during developmental stage, reduced both fecundity and fertility and slightly reduced individual weight. However, in contrast to the nematode, this genetic intervention either shortened or had no effect on lifespan, depending on the level of gene inactivation. Thus, the effects of MRC disruption during development on aging differ between species. We discuss the possible origins of such differences.",2010,"Michael Rera, VÃ©ronique Monnier, HervÃ© Tricoire, Michael Rera, VÃ©ronique Monnier, HervÃ© Tricoire"
Fluorescence in situ hybridization with Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BACs) to mitotic heterochromatin of Drosophila,20809329,10.1007/978-1-60761-789-1_30,"The organization of eukaryotic chromosomes into euchromatin and heterochromatin represents an enigmatic aspect of genome evolution. Constitutive heterochromatin is a basic, yet still poorly understood component of eukaryotic genomes and its molecular characterization by means of standard genomic approaches is intrinsically difficult. Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes do not seem to be particularly useful to map heterochromatin sequences because the typical features of heterochromatin, organized as it is into a chromocenter, limit cytogenetic analysis. In contrast, constitutive heterochromatin has been well-defined at the cytological level in mitotic chromosomes of neuroblasts and has been subdivided into several bands with differential staining properties. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BAC) probes that carry large genomic portions defined by sequence annotation has yielded a ""revolution"" in the field of cytogenetics because it has allowed the mapping of multiple genes at once, thus rendering constitutive heterochromatin amenable to easy and fast cytogenetics analyses. Indeed, BAC-based FISH approaches on Drosophila mitotic chromosomes have made it possible to correlate genomic sequences to their cytogenetic location, aiming to build an integrated map of the pericentric heterochromatin. This chapter presents our standard protocols for BAC-based FISH, aimed at mapping large chromosomal regions of mitotic heterochromatin in Drosophila melanogaster.",2010,"Maria Carmela Accardo, Patrizio Dimitri, Maria Carmela Accardo, Patrizio Dimitri"
dGirdin a new player of Akt /PKB signaling in Drosophila Melanogaster,20515748,10.2741/3668,"A novel substrate of Akt/PKB designated as Girdin (griders of actin filaments) has been identified in mammals and characterized as an actin-binding protein. A Girdin-like protein has been identified in Drosophila, which has two isoforms, dGirdin PA and dGirdin PB. Knockdown of dGirdin in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc cells resulted in reduction of cell size and this was enhanced by half reduction of the Akt gene dose. Furthermore the dGirdin-knockdown wing disc cells exhibited severe disruption of actin filaments. From these in vivo analyses, we conclude that dGirdin is required for actin organization and regulation of appropriate cell size under control of the Akt signaling pathway. Human Girdin plays important roles in cancer progression and angiogenesis. Therefore Girdin and its interacting proteins could be potential pharmaceutical targets for cancer therapies and tumor angiogenesis. Possible use of the Drosophila Girdin model in understanding the mechanisms of cancer progression and in developing preventive and therapeutic strategies will be discussed.",2010,"Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Osamu Suyari, Rika Nagai, Masahide Takahashi, Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Osamu Suyari, Rika Nagai, Masahide Takahashi"

It is responsible for a variety of reproductive alterations of the hosts. Wolbachia is transmitted through the germline from mother to offspring and, in rare cases, between individuals. This implies that acquired properties (through symbiosis with Wolbachia) can become heritable. We investigated the transovarial inheritance of Wolbachia in two phylogenetically distant insects, Drosophila melanogaster and Zyginidia pullula. We detected in both systems bacteriocyte-like cells, densely packed with Wolbachia endosymbionts, at the tip of the ovarioles. Bacteriocytes are cells specialized to harbour bacteria, typical of mutualistic insect symbiosis. Our observations of bacteriocyte-like cells harbouring Wolbachia in the ovary emphasize the plasticity of the female reproductive system of insects, which maintains its function while some cells are densely colonized by bacteria. In summary, there is evidence from different insects that bacteria which behave as parasites of reproduction are harboured by cells resembling bacteriocytes, which appear to mediate transmission of the bacteria to the progeny. It seems a valid hypothesis that the bacteriocyte-like cells that we observed are not the result of a co-evolution of host and symbiont, considering that Wolbachia is not an obligatory symbiont in Drosophila and Zyginidia.",2010,"Luciano Sacchi, Marco Genchi, Emanuela Clementi, Ilaria Negri, Alberto Alma, Stefan Ohler, Davide Sassera, Kostas Bourtzis, Claudio Bandi, Luciano Sacchi, Marco Genchi, Emanuela Clementi, Ilaria Negri, Alberto Alma, Stefan Ohler, Davide Sassera, Kostas Bourtzis, Claudio Bandi"

In this study, we sought to evaluate the potential biological effects and modes of action of PFOA in a range of physiologically and developmentally related phenotypes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The results clearly indicated that the toxic effects of PFOA at the organismal level were associated with the developmental status of the organism, with larvae being most sensitive to this chemical. Except for the decreased weight of both sexes and the reduced longevity of male adults, PFOA had a robust effect on larval development, as determined by reduced body volume, aberrant foraging behavior, molting arrest, and polyphasic lethality. Remarkably, nutrient supplementation of the diet efficiently rescued the lethal effect of high PFOA concentrations on larval development. This result indicated that PFOA probably competed with nutritional components, leading to a disruption of the metabolic pathways responsible for larval development.",2010,"Jianshe Wang, Yan Li, Yang Liu, Hongxia Zhang, Jiayin Dai, Jianshe Wang, Yan Li, Yang Liu, Hongxia Zhang, Jiayin Dai"

"Copy number variation and transposable elements feature in recent, ongoing adaptation at the Cyp6g1 locus",20585622,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000998,"The increased transcription of the Cyp6g1 gene of Drosophila melanogaster, and consequent resistance to insecticides such as DDT, is a widely cited example of adaptation mediated by cis-regulatory change. A fragment of an Accord transposable element inserted upstream of the Cyp6g1 gene is causally associated with resistance and has spread to high frequencies in populations around the world since the 1940s. Here we report the existence of a natural allelic series at this locus of D. melanogaster, involving copy number variation of Cyp6g1, and two additional transposable element insertions (a P and an HMS-Beagle). We provide evidence that this genetic variation underpins phenotypic variation, as the more derived the allele, the greater the level of DDT resistance. Tracking the spatial and temporal patterns of allele frequency changes indicates that the multiple steps of the allelic series are adaptive. Further, a DDT association study shows that the most resistant allele, Cyp6g1-[BP], is greatly enriched in the top 5% of the phenotypic distribution and accounts for approximately 16% of the underlying phenotypic variation in resistance to DDT. In contrast, copy number variation for another candidate resistance gene, Cyp12d1, is not associated with resistance.

In such environments, flies often encounter significant levels of ethanol. Three observations have made Drosophila a very promising model organism to understand the genetic contributions to the behavioral responses to alcohol. First, similar to higher vertebrates, flies show hyperactivation upon exposure to a low to medium dose of alcohol, while high doses can lead to sedation. In addition, when given a choice, flies will actually prefer alcohol-containing food over regular food. Second, the genes and biochemical pathways implicated in controlling these behavioral responses in flies are also participating in determining alcohol responses, and drinking behavior in mammals. Third, the fact that flies have been studied genetically for over one hundred years means that an exceptional repertoire of genetic tools are at our disposal. Here, we will review some of these tools and experimental approaches, survey the methods for, and measures after Drosophila ethanol exposure, and discuss the different molecular components and functional pathways involved in these behavioral responses to alcohol.",2010,"Aylin R Rodan, Adrian Rothenfluh, Aylin R Rodan, Adrian Rothenfluh"
Two frequenins in Drosophila: unveiling the evolutionary history of an unusual neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) duplication,20170488,10.1186/1471-2148-10-54,"Background:
      
    

    
      Drosophila frequenin (Frq), the homolog of the mammalian neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1), is a high affinity calcium-binding protein with ubiquitous expression in the nervous system. This protein has an important role in the regulation of neurotransmitter release per synapse, axonal growth and bouton formation. In D. melanogaster, frequenin is encoded by two genes (frq1 and frq2), a very unexpected feature in the Frq/NCS-1 subfamily. These genes are located in tandem in the same genomic region, and their products are 95% identical in their amino acid sequence, clearly indicating their recent origin by gene duplication. Here, we have investigated the factors involved in this unusual feature by examining the molecular evolution of the two frq genes in Drosophila and the evolutionary dynamics of NCS family in a large set of bilaterian species.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Surprisingly, we have found no amino acid replacements fixed across the twelve Drosophila species surveyed. In contrast, synonymous substitutions have been prevalent in the evolution of the coding region of frq1 and frq2, indicating the presence of strong functional constraints following gene duplication. Despite that, we have detected that significant evolutionary rate acceleration had occurred in Frq1 in early times from the duplication, in which positive selection (likely promoting functional diversification) had probably an important role. The analysis of sequence conservation and DNA topology at the non-coding regions of both genes has allowed the identification of DNA regions candidates to be cis-regulatory elements. The results reveal a possible mechanism of regulatory diversification between frq1 and frq2.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The presence of two frequenins in Drosophila and the rapid accumulation of amino acid substitutions after gene duplication are very unusual features in the evolution of the Frq/NCS-1 subfamily. Here we show that the action of positive selection in concordance with some extent of regulatory diversification might explain these findings. Selected amino acid substitutions in Frq1 likely contributed to the functional divergence between the two duplicates, which, in turn, should have diverged in their regulation by ecdysone-induced early genes.",2010,"Alejandro SÃ¡nchez-Gracia, JesÃºs Romero-Pozuelo, Alberto FerrÃºs, Alejandro SÃ¡nchez-Gracia, JesÃºs Romero-Pozuelo, Alberto FerrÃºs"

In addition, B. mori, also known as the silkworm, is an insect of substantial economic importance, due to its use in silk production and traditional medicines. In this work, we computationally identified 90 putative GPCRs in B. mori, 33 of which represent novel proteins. These GPCRs were annotated and compared with their homologs in Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae. Phylogenetics analyses of the GPCRs from these three insects showed that GPCRs may easily duplicate or disappear during insect evolution, especially in the neuropeptide and protein hormone receptor subfamily. Interestingly, we observed a decrease in the quantity and diversity of the stress-tolerance gene, Methuselah, in B. mori, which may be related to its long history of domestication.

Functional characterization of protein-sorting machineries at the trans-Golgi network in Drosophila melanogaster,20067992,10.1242/jcs.055103,"Targeting of proteins to their final destination is a prerequisite for living cells to maintain their homeostasis. Clathrin functions as a coat that forms transport carriers called clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) at the plasma membrane and post-Golgi compartments. In this study, we established an experimental system using Schneider S2 cells derived from the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model system to study the physiological roles of clathrin adaptors, and to dissect the processes of CCV formation. We found that a clathrin adaptor Drosophila GGA (dGGA), a homolog of mammalian GGA proteins, localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is capable of recruiting clathrin from the cytosol onto TGN membranes. dGGA itself is recruited from the cytosol to the TGN in an ARF1 small GTPase (dARF79F)-dependent manner. dGGA recognizes the cytoplasmic acidic-cluster-dileucine (ACLL) sorting signal of Lerp (lysosomal enzyme receptor protein), a homolog of mammalian mannose 6-phosphate receptors. Moreover, both dGGA and another type of TGN-localized clathrin adaptor, AP-1 (adaptor protein-1 complex), are shown to be involved in the trafficking of Lerp from the TGN to endosomes and/or lysosomes.

Here we describe a novel male sterile mutation of Drosophila melanogaster, wasted (wst), which shows defects in various processes of sperm utilization. The sperm of wst mutant males are stored like those of wild-type males in the female sperm storage organs, the spermathecae and seminal receptacles, after copulation and are released at each ovulation. However, an average of thirteen times more wst sperm than wild type sperm are released at each ovulation, resulting in rapid loss of sperm stored in seminal receptacles within a few days after copulation. wst sperm can enter eggs efficiently at 5 hr after copulation, but the efficiency of sperm entry decreases significantly by 24 hr after copulation, suggesting that wst sperm lose their ability to enter eggs during storage. Furthermore, wst sperm fail to undergo nuclear decondensation, which prevents the process of fertilization even when sperm enter eggs. Our results indicate that the wst gene is essential for independent processes in the utilization of stored sperm; namely, regulation of sperm release from female storage organs, maintenance of sperm efficiency for entry into eggs, and formation of the male pronucleus in the egg at fertilization.",2011,"Takashi Ohsako, Masa-Toshi Yamamoto, Takashi Ohsako, Masa-Toshi Yamamoto"

Furthermore, the Slfc-RNAi males dropped their fertility to less than 10% of the wildtype level, with over 80% of these males being sterile. The Slfc-RNAi females, on the other hand, showed a slight reduction in fertility. This case study demonstrates that a young gene can contribute to fitness on the three important traits of life history in adults, including the life expectancy, male fertility and female fertility, suggesting that new genes can quickly evolve and impact multiple phenotypes.",2011,"Sidi Chen, Haiwang Yang, Benjamin H Krinsky, Anthony Zhang, Manyuan Long, Sidi Chen, Haiwang Yang, Benjamin H Krinsky, Anthony Zhang, Manyuan Long"
Drosophila melanogaster: a new model to study cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity,21514385,10.1016/j.nbd.2011.03.022,"Platinum-based compounds are widely used and effective chemotherapeutic agents; however, sensory peripheral neuropathy is a dose-limiting and long term side effect for 20-30% of patients. A critical question is whether the mechanisms of cell death underlying clinical efficacy can be separated from the effects on neurons in order to develop strategies that prevent platinum-induced neuropathy. In rodent dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRG), cisplatin has been shown to bind and damage neuronal DNA, inducing apoptosis; however genetic manipulation in order to study mechanisms of this phenomenon in the rodent model system is costly and time-consuming. Drosophila melanogaster are commonly used to study neurological disorders, have DNA damage-apoptosis mechanisms homologous to mammalian systems, and have readily-available, inexpensive tools for rapid genetic manipulation. We therefore sought to develop adult Drosophila as a new model to study cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity. Adult Drosophila were exposed to 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 Î¼g/ml cisplatin for 3 days and observed for fly survival and geotactic climbing behavior, cisplatin-DNA binding and cellular apoptosis. On day 3, 50 Î¼g/ml cisplatin reduced the number of flies able to climb above 2 cm to 43% while fly survival was maintained at 92%. 100% lethality was observed at 400 Î¼g/ml cisplatin. Whole fly platinum-genomic DNA adducts were measured and found to be comparable to adduct levels previously measured in rat DRG neurons. Brain, ovaries, kidney and heart harvested from cisplatin treated flies were stained for active caspase 3. Apoptosis was found in ovaries and brain but not in heart and kidney. Brain apoptosis was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Expression of the anti-apoptotic baculoviral protein, p35, in neurons using the GAL4-UAS system prevented cisplatin-induced apoptosis in the brain and restored climbing behavior. In conclusion, cisplatin-induced behavioral and apoptotic changes in Drosophila resemble those seen in mammals. Furthermore, the use of lethality and climbing assays combined with powerful gene manipulation, make Drosophila a suitable model to study mechanisms of cisplatin neurotoxicity.",2011,"Jewel L Podratz, Nathan P Staff, Dara Froemel, Anna Wallner, Florian Wabnig, Allan J Bieber, Amy Tang, Anthony J Windebank, Jewel L Podratz, Nathan P Staff, Dara Froemel, Anna Wallner, Florian Wabnig, Allan J Bieber, Amy Tang, Anthony J Windebank"

Investigating the effects of functionalized carbon nanotubes on reproduction and development in Drosophila melanogaster and CD-1 mice,21963887,10.1016/j.reprotox.2011.09.002,"Despite numerous applications for functionalized carbon nanotubes (fCNTs) in consumer products, such as electronics, and food packaging, as well as their development as drug delivery vehicles, the consequence of their uptake by living systems has been understudied. In particular, the impact of fCNTs on early development of different species is largely unknown. Here we investigated the effect of ingested hydroxyl-fCNTs on reproduction and development in two model organisms: Drosophila and CD-1 mice. While fCNTs had no measurable impact on Drosophila, a single oral dose of fCNTs (10mg/kg) administered to pregnant CD-1 dams during organogenesis significantly increased the number of resorptions and resulted in fetal morphological and skeletal abnormalities. The observed difference between the responses of these two models likely reflects their physiology and/or differences in administration. This research underscores the need to examine the effects of fCNTs on reproductive health and development before the opportunities for maternal exposure by fCNTs increase further.",2011,"Nicola A Philbrook, Virginia K Walker, A R M Nabiul Afrooz, Navid B Saleh, Louise M Winn, Nicola A Philbrook, Virginia K Walker, A R M Nabiul Afrooz, Navid B Saleh, Louise M Winn"
Integrins are necessary for the development and maintenance of the glial layers in the Drosophila peripheral nerve,21828098,10.1242/dev.064816,"Peripheral nerve development involves multiple classes of glia that cooperate to form overlapping glial layers paired with the deposition of a surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). The formation of this tubular structure protects the ensheathed axons from physical and pathogenic damage and from changes in the ionic environment. Integrins, a major family of ECM receptors, play a number of roles in the development of myelinating Schwann cells, one class of glia ensheathing the peripheral nerves of vertebrates. However, the identity and the role of the integrin complexes utilized by the other classes of peripheral nerve glia have not been determined in any animal. Here, we show that, in the peripheral nerves of Drosophila melanogaster, two integrin complexes (Î±PS2Î²PS and Î±PS3Î²PS) are expressed in the different glial layers and form adhesion complexes with integrin-linked kinase and Talin. Knockdown of the common beta subunit (Î²PS) using inducible RNAi in all glial cells results in lethality and glial defects. Analysis of integrin complex function in specific glial layers showed that loss of Î²PS in the outermost layer (the perineurial glia) results in a failure to wrap the nerve, a phenotype similar to that of Matrix metalloproteinase 2-mediated degradation of the ECM. Knockdown of Î²PS integrin in the innermost wrapping glia causes a loss of glial processes around axons. Together, our data suggest that integrins are employed in different glial layers to mediate the development and maintenance of the protective glial sheath in Drosophila peripheral nerves.",2011,"Xiaojun Xie, Vanessa J Auld, Xiaojun Xie, Vanessa J Auld"

The results showed that: i) putative orthologs of RING domains between Drosophila melanogaster and the human largely occur (118/139, 84.9%); ii) of the 118 orthologous pairs from Drosophila melanogaster and the human, 117 pairs (117/118, 99.2%) were found to retain entirely uniform domain architectures, only Iap2/Diap2 experienced evolutionary expansion of domain architecture; iii) 4 evolutionary structurally conserved regions (SCRs) are responsible for homologous folding of RING domains at the superfamily level; iv) besides the conserved Cys/His chelating zinc ions, 6 equivalent residues (4 hydrophobic and 2 polar residues) in the SCRs possess good-consensus and conservation- these 4 SCRs function in the structural positioning of 6 equivalent residues as determinants for RING-E3 catalysis; v) members of these RING proteins located nucleus, multiple subcellular compartments, membrane protein and mitochondrion are respectively 42 (42/139, 30.2%), 71 (71/139, 51.1%), 22 (22/139, 15.8%) and 4 (4/139, 2.9%); vi) CG15104 (Topors) and CG1134 (Mul1) in C3HC4, and CG3929 (Deltex) in C3H2C3 seem to display broader E2s binding profiles than other RING-E3s; vii) analyzing intermolecular interfaces of E2/RING-E3 complexes indicate that residues directly interacting with E2s are all from the SCRs in RING domains. Of the 6 residues, 2 hydrophobic ones contribute to constructing the conserved hydrophobic core, while the 2 hydrophobic and 2 polar residues directly participate in E2/RING-E3 interactions.

"CYP18A1, a key enzyme of Drosophila steroid hormone inactivation, is essential for metamorphosis",20932968,10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.09.023,"Ecdysteroids are steroid hormones, which coordinate major developmental transitions in insects. Both the rises and falls in circulating levels of active hormones are important for coordinating molting and metamorphosis, making both ecdysteroid biosynthesis and inactivation of physiological relevance. We demonstrate that Drosophila melanogaster Cyp18a1 encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP) with 26-hydroxylase activity, a prominent step in ecdysteroid catabolism. A clear ortholog of Cyp18a1 exists in most insects and crustaceans. When Cyp18a1 is transfected in Drosophila S2 cells, extensive conversion of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) into 20-hydroxyecdysonoic acid is observed. This is a multi-step process, which involves the formation of 20,26-dihydroxyecdysone as an intermediate. In Drosophila larvae, Cyp18a1 is expressed in many target tissues of 20E. We examined the consequences of Cyp18a1 inactivation on Drosophila development. Null alleles generated by excision of a P element and RNAi knockdown of Cyp18a1 both result in pupal lethality, possibly as a consequence of impaired ecdysteroid degradation.

Loss of the bloom syndrome helicase increases DNA ligase 4-independent genome rearrangements and tumorigenesis in aging Drosophila,22183041,10.1186/gb-2011-12-12-r121,"Background:
      
    

    
      The BLM DNA helicase plays a vital role in maintaining genome stability. Mutations in BLM cause Bloom syndrome, a rare disorder associated with cancer predisposition and premature aging. Humans and mice with blm mutations have increased frequencies of spontaneous mutagenesis, but the molecular basis of this increase is not well understood. In addition, the effect of aging on spontaneous mutagenesis in blm mutants has not been characterized. To address this, we used a lacZ reporter system in wild-type and several mutant strains of Drosophila melanogaster to analyze mechanisms of mutagenesis throughout their lifespan.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Our data show that Drosophila lacking BLM have an elevated frequency of spontaneous genome rearrangements that increases with age. Although in normal flies most genome rearrangements occur through DNA ligase 4-dependent classical end joining, most rearrangements that accumulate during aging in blm mutants do not require DNA ligase 4, suggesting the influence of an alternative end-joining mechanism. Adult blm mutants also display reduced lifespan and ligase 4-independent enhanced tumorigenesis in mitotically active tissues.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      These results suggest that Drosophila BLM suppresses error-prone alternative end-joining repair of DNA double-strand breaks that can result in genome instability and tumor formation during aging. In addition, since loss of BLM significantly affects lifespan and tumorigenesis, the data provide a link between error-prone end joining, genome rearrangements, and tumor formation in a model metazoan.",2011,"Ana Maria Garcia, Robert N Salomon, Alice Witsell, Justine Liepkalns, R Brent Calder, Moonsook Lee, Martha Lundell, Jan Vijg, Mitch McVey, Ana Maria Garcia, Robert N Salomon, Alice Witsell, Justine Liepkalns, R Brent Calder, Moonsook Lee, Martha Lundell, Jan Vijg, Mitch McVey"
Non-apoptotic function of apoptotic proteins in the development of Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster,21799264,10.1007/s12038-011-9092-3,"Drosophila metamorphosis is characterized by the histolysis of larval structures by programmed cell death, which paves the way for the establishment of adult-specific structures under the influence of the steroid hormone ecdysone. Malpighian tubules function as an excretory system and are one of the larval structures that are not destroyed during metamorphosis and are carried over to adulthood. The pupal Malpighian tubules evade destruction in spite of expressing apoptotic proteins, Reaper, Hid, Grim, Dronc and Drice. Here we show that in the Malpighian tubules expression of apoptotic proteins commences right from embryonic development and continues throughout the larval stages. Overexpression of these proteins in the Malpighian tubules causes larval lethality resulting in malformed tubules. The number and regular organization of principal and stellate cells of Malpighian tubules is disturbed, in turn disrupting the physiological functioning of the tubules as well. Strikingly, the localization of beta-tubulin, F-actin and Disclarge (Dlg) is also disrupted.

The Drosophila blood brain barrier is maintained by GPCR-dependent dynamic actin structures,21242289,10.1083/jcb.201007095,"The blood brain barrier (BBB) is essential for insulation of the nervous system from the surrounding environment. In Drosophila melanogaster, the BBB is maintained by septate junctions formed between subperineurial glia (SPG) and requires the Moody/G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway. In this study, we describe novel specialized actin-rich structures (ARSs) that dynamically form along the lateral borders of the SPG cells. ARS formation and association with nonmuscle myosin is regulated by Moody/GPCR signaling and requires myosin activation. Consistently, an overlap between ARS localization, elevated Ca(2+) levels, and myosin light chain phosphorylation is detected. Disruption of the ARS by inhibition of the actin regulator Arp2/3 complex leads to abrogation of the BBB. Our results suggest a mechanism by which the Drosophila BBB is maintained by Moody/GPCR-dependent formation of ARSs, which is supported by myosin activation. The localization of the ARSs close to the septate junctions enables efficient sealing of membrane gaps formed during nerve cord growth.",2011,"Meital Hatan, Vera Shinder, David Israeli, Frank Schnorrer, Talila Volk, Meital Hatan, Vera Shinder, David Israeli, Frank Schnorrer, Talila Volk"

We found that exposure to the static magnetic field reduced development time in both species, but statistical significance was found only for D. hydei.

The OCT scanning results of mutant flies with impaired proteasome function in cardiac muscles show irregular heartbeat patterns and systematically decreased average beat rates, when compared with the regular patterns of ~4.97 beats/s in average beat rate of the wild-type. In both wild-type and proteasome mutant flies, the beatings at different locations in the same heart segment are essentially synchronized. However, between different heart segments, although the beating in the second segment shows a lag in phase behind that of the first segment in a wild-type, in a proteasome mutant, the beating in the second segment becomes significantly leading that of the first segment.

Genome-wide analysis of retrogene polymorphisms in Drosophila melanogaster,22135405,10.1101/gr.116434.110,"Gene duplication via retrotransposition has been shown to be an important mechanism in evolution, affecting gene dosage and allowing for the acquisition of new gene functions. Although fixed retrotransposed genes have been found in a variety of species, very little effort has been made to identify retrogene polymorphisms. Here, we examine 37 Illumina-sequenced North American Drosophila melanogaster inbred lines and present the first ever data set and analysis of polymorphic retrogenes in Drosophila. We show that this type of polymorphism is quite common, with any two gametes in the North American population differing in the presence or absence of six retrogenes, accounting for ~13% of gene copy-number heterozygosity. These retrogenes were identified by a straightforward method that can be applied using any type of DNA sequencing data. We also use a variant of this method to conduct a genome-wide scan for intron presence/absence polymorphisms, and show that any two chromosomes in the population likely differ in the presence of multiple introns. We show that these polymorphisms are all in fact deletions rather than intron gain events present in the reference genome. Finally, by leveraging the known location of the parental genes that give rise to the retrogene polymorphisms, we provide direct evidence that natural selection is responsible for the excess of fixations of retrogenes moving off of the X chromosome in Drosophila. Further efforts to identify retrogene and intron presence/absence polymorphisms will undoubtedly improve our understanding of the evolution of gene copy number and gene structure.",2011,"Daniel R Schrider, Kristian Stevens, Charis M CardeÃ±o, Charles H Langley, Matthew W Hahn, Daniel R Schrider, Kristian Stevens, Charis M CardeÃ±o, Charles H Langley, Matthew W Hahn"
A Drosophila model for genetic analysis of influenza viral/host interactions,21775472,10.1534/genetics.111.132290,"Influenza viruses impose a constant threat to vertebrates susceptible to this family of viruses. We have developed a new tool to study virus-host interactions that play key roles in viral replication and to help identify novel anti-influenza drug targets. Via the UAS/Gal4 system we ectopically expressed the influenza virus M2 gene in Drosophila melanogaster and generated dose-sensitive phenotypes in the eye and wing. We have confirmed that the M2 proton channel is properly targeted to cell membranes in Drosophila tissues and functions as a proton channel by altering intracellular pH. As part of the efficacy for potential anti-influenza drug screens, we have also demonstrated that the anti-influenza drug amantadine, which targets the M2 proton channel, suppressed the UAS-M2 mutant phenotype when fed to larvae. In a candidate gene screen we identified mutations in components of the vacuolar V1V0 ATPase that modify the UAS-M2 phenotype. Importantly, in this study we demonstrate that Drosophila genetic interactions translate directly to physiological requirements of the influenza A virus for these components in mammalian cells. Overexpressing specific V1 subunits altered the replication capacity of influenza virus in cell culture and suggests that drugs targeting the enzyme complex via these subunits may be useful in anti-influenza drug therapies. Moreover, this study adds credence to the idea of using the M2 ""flu fly"" to identify new and previously unconsidered cellular genes as potential drug targets and to provide insight into basic mechanisms of influenza virus biology.",2011,"Amy L Adamson, Kultaran Chohan, Jennifer Swenson, Dennis LaJeunesse, Amy L Adamson, Kultaran Chohan, Jennifer Swenson, Dennis LaJeunesse"
Natural variation in decision-making behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,21283727,10.1371/journal.pone.0016436,"There has been considerable recent interest in using Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the molecular basis of decision-making behavior. Deciding where to place eggs is likely one of the most important decisions for a female fly, as eggs are vulnerable and larvae have limited motility. Here, we show that many natural genotypes of D. melanogaster prefer to lay eggs near nutritious substrate, rather than in nutritious substrate. These preferences are highly polymorphic in both degree and direction, with considerable heritability (0.488) and evolvability.Relative preferences are modulated by the distance between options and the overall concentration of ethanol, suggesting Drosophila integrate many environmental factors when making oviposition decisions. As oviposition-related decisions can be efficiently assessed by simply counting eggs, oviposition behavior is an excellent model for understanding information processing in insects. Associating natural genetic polymorphisms with decision-making variation will shed light on the molecular basis of host choice behavior, the evolutionary maintenance of genetic variation, and the mechanistic nature of preference variation in general.",2011,"Paige M Miller, Julia B Saltz, Veronica A Cochrane, Caitlin M Marcinkowski, Raisa Mobin, Thomas L Turner"
A remarkably stable TipE gene cluster: evolution of insect Para sodium channel auxiliary subunits,22098672,10.1186/1471-2148-11-337,"Background:
      
    

    
      First identified in fruit flies with temperature-sensitive paralysis phenotypes, the Drosophila melanogaster TipE locus encodes four voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channel auxiliary subunits. This cluster of TipE-like genes on chromosome 3L, and a fifth family member on chromosome 3R, are important for the optional expression and functionality of the Para NaV channel but appear quite distinct from auxiliary subunits in vertebrates. Here, we exploited available arthropod genomic resources to trace the origin of TipE-like genes by mapping their evolutionary histories and examining their genomic architectures.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We identified a remarkably conserved synteny block of TipE-like orthologues with well-maintained local gene arrangements from 21 insect species. Homologues in the water flea, Daphnia pulex, suggest an ancestral pancrustacean repertoire of four TipE-like genes; a subsequent gene duplication may have generated functional redundancy allowing gene losses in the silk moth and mosquitoes. Intronic nesting of the insect TipE gene cluster probably occurred following the divergence from crustaceans, but in the flour beetle and silk moth genomes the clusters apparently escaped from nesting. Across Pancrustacea, TipE gene family members have experienced intronic nesting, escape from nesting, retrotransposition, translocation, and gene loss events while generally maintaining their local gene neighbourhoods. D. melanogaster TipE-like genes exhibit coordinated spatial and temporal regulation of expression distinct from their host gene but well-correlated with their regulatory target, the Para NaV channel, suggesting that functional constraints may preserve the TipE gene cluster. We identified homology between TipE-like NaV channel regulators and vertebrate Slo-beta auxiliary subunits of big-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) channels, which suggests that ion channel regulatory partners have evolved distinct lineage-specific characteristics.

      TipE-like genes form a remarkably conserved genomic cluster across all examined insect genomes.

The SWH pathway is highly conserved between D. melanogaster and mammals, both in function and in the mechanism of signal transduction. The mammalian SWH pathway limits tissue growth by inhibiting the nuclear access and expression of the transcriptional co-activator, Yes-associated protein (YAP). Mutation and altered expression of SWH pathway proteins has been observed in several types of human cancer, but the contribution of these events to tumorigenesis has been unclear. Here we show that YAP can enhance the transformed phenotype of ovarian cancer cell lines and that YAP confers resistance to chemotherapeutic agents that are commonly used to treat ovarian cancer. We find that high nuclear YAP expression correlates with poor patient prognosis in a cohort of 268 invasive epithelial ovarian cancer samples.

Effects of different small HSPB members on contractile dysfunction and structural changes in a Drosophila melanogaster model for Atrial Fibrillation,21745477,10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.06.008,"The most common clinical tachycardia, Atrial Fibrillation (AF), is a progressive disease, caused by cardiomyocyte remodeling, which finally results in contractile dysfunction and AF persistence. Recently, we identified a protective role of heat shock proteins (HSPs), especially the small HSPB1 member, against tachycardia remodeling in experimental AF models. Our understanding of tachycardia remodeling and anti-remodeling drugs is currently hampered by the lack of suitable (genetic) manipulatable in vivo models for rapid screening of key targets in remodeling. We hypothesized that Drosophila melanogaster can be exploited to study tachycardia remodeling and protective effects of HSPs by drug treatments or by utilizing genetically manipulated small HSP-overexpressing strains. Tachypacing of Drosophila pupae resulted in gradual and significant cardiomyocyte remodeling, demonstrated by reduced contraction rate, increase in arrhythmic episodes and reduction in heart wall shortening, compared to normal paced pupae. Heat shock, or pre-treatment with HSP-inducers GGA and BGP-15, resulted in endogenous HSP overexpression and protection against tachycardia remodeling. DmHSP23 overexpressing Drosophilas were protected against tachycardia remodeling, in contrast to overexpression of other small HSPs (DmHSP27, DmHSP67Bc, DmCG4461, DmCG7409, and DmCG14207). (Ultra)structural evaluation of the tachypaced heart wall revealed loss of sarcomeres and mitochondrial damage which were absent in tachypaced DmHSP23 overexpressing Drosophila. In addition, tachypacing induced a significant increase in calpain activity, which was prevented in tachypaced Drosophila overexpressing DmHSP23.

A high-sugar diet produces obesity and insulin resistance in wild-type Drosophila,21719444,10.1242/dmm.007948,"Insulin-resistant, 'type 2' diabetes (T2D) results from a complex interplay between genes and environment. In particular, both caloric excess and obesity are strongly associated with T2D across many genetic backgrounds. To gain insights into how dietary excess affects insulin resistance, we studied the simple model organism Drosophila melanogaster. Larvae reared on a high-sugar diet were hyperglycemic, insulin resistant and accumulated fat--hallmarks of T2D--compared with those reared on control diets. Excess dietary sugars, but not fats or proteins, elicited insulin-resistant phenotypes. Expression of genes involved in lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis and Î²-oxidation was upregulated in high-sugar-fed larvae, as were FOXO targets, consistent with known mechanisms of insulin resistance in humans. These data establish a novel Drosophila model of diet-induced insulin resistance that bears strong similarity to the pathophysiology of T2D in humans.",2011,"Laura Palanker Musselman, Jill L Fink, Kirk Narzinski, Prasanna Venkatesh Ramachandran, Sumitha Sukumar Hathiramani, Ross L Cagan, Thomas J Baranski, Laura Palanker Musselman, Jill L Fink, Kirk Narzinski, Prasanna Venkatesh Ramachandran, Sumitha Sukumar Hathiramani, Ross L Cagan, Thomas J Baranski"
BMP signaling dynamics in the follicle cells of multiple Drosophila species,21402065,10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.03.005,"The dorsal anterior region of the follicle cells (FCs) in the developing Drosophila egg gives rise to the respiratory eggshell appendages. These tubular structures display a wide range of qualitative and quantitative variations across Drosophila species, providing a remarkable example of a rapidly evolving morphology. In D. melanogaster, the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway is an important regulator of FCs patterning and dorsal appendages morphology. To explore the mechanisms underlying the diversification of eggshell patterning, we analyzed BMP signaling in the FCs of 16 Drosophila species that span 45 million years of evolution. We found that the spatial patterns of BMP signaling in the FCs are dynamic and exhibit a range of interspecies' variations. In most of the species examined, the dynamics of BMP signaling correlate with the expression of the type I BMP receptor thickveins (tkv). This correlation suggests that interspecies' variations of tkv expression are responsible for the diversification of BMP signaling during oogenesis. This model was supported by genetic manipulations of tkv expression in the FCs of D. melanogaster that successfully recapitulated the signaling diversities found in the other species. Our results suggest that regulation of receptor expression mediates spatial diversification of BMP signaling in Drosophila oogenesis, and they provide insight into a mechanism underlying the evolution of eggshell patterning.",2011,"Matthew G Niepielko, Yainna HernÃ¡iz-HernÃ¡ndez, Nir Yakoby, Matthew G Niepielko, Yainna HernÃ¡iz-HernÃ¡ndez, Nir Yakoby"
Population transcriptomics of Drosophila melanogaster females,21276238,10.1186/1471-2164-12-81,"Background:
      
    

    
      Variation at the level of gene expression is abundant in natural populations and is thought to contribute to the adaptive divergence of populations and species. Gene expression also differs considerably between males and females. Here we report a microarray analysis of gene expression variation among females of 16 Drosophila melanogaster strains derived from natural populations, including eight strains from the putative ancestral range in sub-Saharan Africa and eight strains from Europe. Gene expression variation among males of the same strains was reported previously.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We detected relatively low levels of expression polymorphism within populations, but much higher expression divergence between populations. A total of 569 genes showed a significant expression difference between the African and European populations at a false discovery rate of 5%. Genes with significant over-expression in Europe included the insecticide resistance gene Cyp6g1, as well as genes involved in proteolysis and olfaction. Genes with functions in carbohydrate metabolism and vision were significantly over-expressed in the African population. There was little overlap between genes expressed differently between populations in females and males.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our results suggest that adaptive changes in gene expression have accompanied the out-of-Africa migration of D. melanogaster. Comparison of female and male expression data indicates that the vast majority of genes differing in expression between populations do so in only one sex and suggests that most regulatory adaptation has been sex-specific.",2011,"Lena MÃ¼ller, Stephan Hutter, Rayna Stamboliyska, Sarah S Saminadin-Peter, Wolfgang Stephan, John Parsch, Lena MÃ¼ller, Stephan Hutter, Rayna Stamboliyska, Sarah S Saminadin-Peter, Wolfgang Stephan, John Parsch"
Functional dissection of the neural substrates for sexual behaviors in Drosophila melanogaster,21705753,10.1534/genetics.111.129940,"The male-specific Fruitless proteins (FruM) act to establish the potential for male courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster and are expressed in small groups of neurons throughout the nervous system. We screened ??000 GAL4 lines, using assays for general courtship, male-male interactions, and male fertility to determine the phenotypes resulting from the GAL4-driven inhibition of FruM expression in subsets of these neurons. A battery of secondary assays showed that the phenotypic classes of GAL4 lines could be divided into subgroups on the basis of additional neurobiological and behavioral criteria. For example, in some lines, restoration of FruM expression in cholinergic neurons restores fertility or reduces male-male courtship. Persistent chains of males courting each other in some lines results from males courting both sexes indiscriminately, whereas in other lines this phenotype results from apparent habituation deficits. Inhibition of ectopic FruM expression in females, in populations of neurons where FruM is necessary for male fertility, can rescue female infertility. To identify the neurons responsible for some of the observed behavioral alterations, we determined the overlap between the identified GAL4 lines and endogenous FruM expression in lines with fertility defects. The GAL4 lines causing fertility defects generally had widespread overlap with FruM expression in many regions of the nervous system, suggesting likely redundant FruM-expressing neuronal pathways capable of conferring male fertility. From associations between the screened behaviors, we propose a functional model for courtship initiation.",2011,"Geoffrey W Meissner, Devanand S Manoli, Jose F Chavez, Jon-Michael Knapp, Tasha L Lin, Robin J Stevens, David J Mellert, David H Tran, Bruce S Baker, Geoffrey W Meissner, Devanand S Manoli, Jose F Chavez, Jon-Michael Knapp, Tasha L Lin, Robin J Stevens, David J Mellert, David H Tran, Bruce S Baker"
Recognition of the pre-miRNA structure by Drosophila Dicer-1,21926993,10.1038/nsmb.2125,"Drosophila melanogaster has two Dicer proteins with specialized functions. Dicer-1 liberates miRNA-miRNA* duplexes from precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), whereas Dicer-2 processes long double-stranded RNAs into small interfering RNA duplexes. It was recently demonstrated that Dicer-2 is rendered highly specific for long double-stranded RNA substrates by inorganic phosphate and a partner protein R2D2. However, it remains unclear how Dicer-1 exclusively recognize pre-miRNAs. Here we show that fly Dicer-1 recognizes the single-stranded terminal loop structure of pre-miRNAs through its N-terminal helicase domain, checks the loop size and measures the distance between the 3' overhang and the terminal loop. This unique mechanism allows fly Dicer-1 to strictly inspect the authenticity of pre-miRNA structures.",2011,"Akihisa Tsutsumi, Tomoko Kawamata, Natsuko Izumi, HervÃ© Seitz, Yukihide Tomari, Akihisa Tsutsumi, Tomoko Kawamata, Natsuko Izumi, HervÃ© Seitz, Yukihide Tomari"
Evolutionary consequences of altered atmospheric oxygen in Drosophila melanogaster,22046390,10.1371/journal.pone.0026876,"Twelve replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster, all derived from a common ancestor, were independently evolved for 34+ generations in one of three treatment environments of varying PO(2): hypoxia (5.0-10.1 kPa), normoxia (21.3 kPa), and hyperoxia (40.5 kPa). Several traits related to whole animal performance and metabolism were assayed at various stages via ""common garden"" and reciprocal transplant assays to directly compare evolved and acclimatory differences among treatments. Results clearly demonstrate the evolution of a greater tolerance to acute hypoxia in the hypoxia-evolved populations, consistent with adaptation to this environment. Greater hypoxia tolerance was associated with an increase in citrate synthase activity in fly homogenate when compared to normoxic (control) populations, suggesting an increase in mitochondrial volume density in these populations. In contrast, no direct evidence of increased performance of the hyperoxia-evolved populations was detected, although a significant decrease in the tolerance of these populations to acute hypoxia suggests a cost to adaptation to hyperoxia. Hyperoxia-evolved populations had lower productivity overall (i.e., across treatment environments) and there was no evidence that hypoxia or hyperoxia-evolved populations had greatest productivity or longevity in their respective treatment environments, suggesting that these assays failed to capture the components of fitness relevant to adaptation.",2011,"Marc Charette, Charles-A Darveau, Steve F Perry, Howard D Rundle, Marc Charette, Charles-A Darveau, Steve F Perry, Howard D Rundle"
Proposal of an in vivo comet assay using haemocytes of Drosophila melanogaster,20740640,10.1002/em.20604,"This study presents the first application of an in vivo alkaline comet assay using haemocytes of Drosophila melanogaster larvae. These cells, which play a role similar to that of mammalian blood, can be easily obtained and represent an overall exposure of the treated larvae. To validate the assay, we evaluated the response of these cells to three well-known mutagenic agents: ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), potassium dichromate (PD), and gamma radiation (Î³-irradiation). Third-instar Drosophila larvae were exposed to different concentrations of EMS (1, 2, and 4 mM) and PD (0.5, 1, and 2.5 mM) and to different doses of Î³-irradiation (2, 4, and 8 GÎ³). Subsequently, haemolymph was extracted from the larvae, and haemocytes were isolated by centrifugation and used in the comet assay. Haemocytes exhibited a significant dose-related increase in DNA damage, indicating that these cells are clearly sensitive to the treatments.

A Drosophila model for alcohol reward,21499254,10.1038/nn.2805,"The rewarding properties of drugs contribute to the development of abuse and addiction. We developed a new assay for investigating the motivational properties of ethanol in the genetically tractable model Drosophila melanogaster. Flies learned to associate cues with ethanol intoxication and, although transiently aversive, the experience led to a long-lasting attraction for the ethanol-paired cue, implying that intoxication is rewarding. Temporally blocking transmission in dopaminergic neurons revealed that flies require activation of these neurons to express, but not develop, conditioned preference for ethanol-associated cues. Moreover, flies acquired, consolidated and retrieved these rewarding memories using distinct sets of neurons in the mushroom body. Finally, mutations in scabrous, encoding a fibrinogen-related peptide that regulates Notch signaling, disrupted the formation of memories for ethanol reward. Our results thus establish that Drosophila can be useful for understanding the molecular, genetic and neural mechanisms underling the rewarding properties of ethanol.",2011,"Karla R Kaun, Reza Azanchi, Zaw Maung, Jay Hirsh, Ulrike Heberlein, Karla R Kaun, Reza Azanchi, Zaw Maung, Jay Hirsh, Ulrike Heberlein"

This result was also seen in D. melanogaster and Drosophila simulans infected with the closely related wMel strain.

Sperm competition and mate harm unresponsive to male-limited selection in Drosophila: an evolving genetic architecture under domestication,21884048,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01328.x,"Earlier research by W.R. Rice showed that experimentally limiting gene expression to males in Drosophila melanogaster leads to the rapid evolution of higher fitness. Using a similar male-limited (ML) selection protocol, we confirmed that result and showed that eliminating intralocus sexual conflict results in a comprehensive remodeling of the sexually dimorphic phenotype. However, despite starting from laboratory-evolved descendants of the same founder population used in earlier work, we found no evidence for the increased performance in sperm competition or increased postmating harm to females previously demonstrated. We employed females with both ancestral population genotypes and those of the special ""clone generator"" females used in ML selection. Despite strong differences in sperm storage or usage patterns between these females, there was no detectable adaptation by males to the specific female stock used in the selection protocol. The lack of evolution of postcopulatory traits suggests either that requisite genetic variation was eliminated by long-term domestication of the base population, or that complex male-by-male-by-female interactions made these traits unavailable to selection. The different evolutionary outcomes produced by two very similar experiments done at different time points underscores the potential for cryptic adaptation in the laboratory to qualitatively affect inferences made using quantitative genetic methodologies.",2011,"Pan-Pan Jiang, Stephanie Bedhomme, N G Prasad, Adam Chippindale, Pan-Pan Jiang, Stephanie Bedhomme, N G Prasad, Adam Chippindale"
Minibrain/Dyrk1a regulates food intake through the Sir2-FOXO-sNPF/NPY pathway in Drosophila and mammals,22876196,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002857,"Feeding behavior is one of the most essential activities in animals, which is tightly regulated by neuroendocrine factors.

Here, we found that minibrain (mnb) and the mammalian ortholog Dyrk1a, target genes of sNPF and NPY signaling, [corrected] regulate food intake in Drosophila melanogaster and mice. In Drosophila melanogaster neuronal cells and mouse hypothalamic cells, sNPF and NPY modulated the mnb and Dyrk1a expression through the PKA-CREB pathway. Increased Dyrk1a activated Sirt1 to regulate the deacetylation of FOXO, which potentiated FOXO-induced sNPF/NPY expression and in turn promoted food intake. Conversely, AKT-mediated insulin signaling suppressed FOXO-mediated sNPF/NPY expression, which resulted in decreasing food intake. Furthermore, human Dyrk1a transgenic mice exhibited decreased FOXO acetylation and increased NPY expression in the hypothalamus, and [corrected] increased food intake.

A novel Drosophila SOD2 mutant demonstrates a role for mitochondrial ROS in neurodevelopment and disease,22950046,10.1002/brb3.73,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play essential roles in cell signaling, survival, and homeostasis. Aberrant ROS lead to disease and contribute to the aging process. Numerous enzymes and vigilant antioxidant pathways are required to regulate ROS for normal cellular health. Mitochondria are a major source of ROS, and mechanisms to prevent elevated ROS during oxidative phosphorylation require super oxide dismutase (SOD) activity. SOD2, also known as MnSOD, is targeted to mitochondria and is instrumental in regulating ROS by conversion of superoxides to hydrogen peroxide, which is further broken down into H(2)O and oxygen. Here, we describe the identification of a novel mutation within the mitochondrial SOD2 enzyme in Drosophila that results in adults with an extremely shortened life span, sensitivity to hyperoxia, and neuropathology. Additional studies demonstrate that this novel mutant, SOD2(bewildered), exhibits abnormal brain morphology, suggesting a critical role for this protein in neurodevelopment. We investigated the basis of this neurodevelopmental defect and discovered an increase in aberrant axonal that could underlie the aberrant neurodevelopment and brain morphology defects.

PABP and the poly(A) tail augment microRNA repression by facilitated miRISC binding,22635249,10.1038/nsmb.2309,"Polyadenylated mRNAs are typically more strongly repressed by microRNAs (miRNAs) than their nonadenylated counterparts.

These findings are mechanistically explained by a notable function of PABP: it promotes association of miRISC with miRNA-regulated mRNAs.

Here we report the findings of our study aimed at evaluating how circadian egg laying rhythm in fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster entrains to time cues provided by light and temperature. Previous studies have shown that activity/rest rhythm of flies entrains readily to light/dark (LD) and temperature cycles (TC). Our present study revealed that egg laying rhythm of a greater percentage of females entrains to TC compared to LD cycles. Therefore, in the specific context of our study this result can be taken to suggest that egg laying clocks of D. melanogaster entrains to TC more readily than LD cycles. However, when TC were presented along with out-of-phase LD cycles, the rhythm displayed two peaks, one occurring close to lights-off and the other near the onset of low temperature phase, indicating that upon entrainment by TC, LD cycles may be able to exert a greater influence on the phase of the rhythm.

Its molecular organization is largely unknown due to difficulties in sequencing through and assembling repetitive sequences enriched in the heterochromatin. Here we developed a novel strategy using chromosomal rearrangements and embryonic phenotypes to position unmapped Drosophila melanogaster heterochromatic sequence to specific chromosomal regions. By excluding sequences that can be mapped to the assembled euchromatic arms, we identified sequences that are specific to heterochromatin and used them to design heterochromatin specific probes (""H-probes"") for microarray. By comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analyses of embryos deficient for each chromosome or chromosome arm, we were able to map most of our H-probes to specific chromosome arms. We also positioned sequences mapped to the second and X chromosomes to finer intervals by analyzing smaller deletions with breakpoints in heterochromatin. Using this approach, we were able to map >40% (13.9 Mb) of the previously unmapped heterochromatin sequences assembled by the whole-genome sequencing effort on arm U and arm Uextra to specific locations. We also identified and mapped 110 kb of novel heterochromatic sequences. Subsequent analyses revealed that sequences located within different heterochromatic regions have distinct properties, such as sequence composition, degree of repetitiveness, and level of underreplication in polytenized tissues. Surprisingly, although heterochromatin is generally considered to be transcriptionally silent, we detected region-specific temporal patterns of transcription in heterochromatin during oogenesis and early embryonic development.

The concentration of Ca(2+) and K(+) in the hemolymph of destruxin A-injected flies was not significantly different from those of control flies after 3 h. Taken together, these results show that destruxin A produces differential effects on ion transport by renal and gut tissues.

Analyzing frizzled signaling using fixed and live imaging of the asymmetric cell division of the Drosophila sensory organ precursor cell,22218889,10.1007/978-1-61779-510-7_2,"When you look at the dorsal thorax of a fruitfly, you can easily get fascinated by the high degree of alignment of the bristles that show a strong polarization in their surface organization. This organization of cells in the plane of the epithelium is known as planar cell polarity (PCP), and was initially characterized in Drosophila melanogaster. This process is important in a broad variety of morphological cellular asymmetries in various organisms. In Drosophila, genetic studies of PCP mutants showed that the asymmetric division of the sensory organ precursor cell (pI cell) is polarized along the anterior-posterior axis by Frizzled receptor signaling. Here, we described two methods to image and analyze the PCP in the pI cell model.",2012,"Bertrand Jauffred, Yohanns Bellaiche, Bertrand Jauffred, Yohanns Bellaiche"

Drosophila melanogaster p24 trafficking proteins have vital roles in development and reproduction,22554671,10.1016/j.mod.2012.04.002,"p24 proteins comprise a family of type-I transmembrane proteins of ~24kD that are present in yeast and plants as well as metazoans ranging from Drosophila to humans. These proteins are most commonly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi interface and are incorporated in anterograde and retrograde transport vesicles. Little is known about how disruption of p24 signaling affects individual tissue function or whole animals. Drosophila melanogaster express nine p24 genes, grouped into four subfamilies. Based upon our mRNA and protein expression data, Drosophila p24 family members are expressed in a variety of tissues. To identify functions for particular Drosophila p24 proteins, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to reduce p24 expression. Ubiquitous reduction of most p24 genes resulted in complete or partial lethality during development. We found that reducing p24 levels in adults caused defects in female fecundity (egg laying) and also reduced male fertility. We attributed reduced female fecundity to decreased neural p24 expression. These results provide the first genetic analysis of all p24 family members in a multicellular animal and indicate vital roles for Drosophila p24s in development and reproduction, implicating neural expression of p24s in the regulation of female behavior.",2012,"Sehresh Saleem, Christoph C Schwedes, Lisa L Ellis, Stephanie T Grady, Rachel L Adams, Natalie Johnson, Julie R Whittington, Ginger E Carney, Sehresh Saleem, Christoph C Schwedes, Lisa L Ellis, Stephanie T Grady, Rachel L Adams, Natalie Johnson, Julie R Whittington, Ginger E Carney"
Drosophila eyes absent is a novel mRNA target of the tristetraprolin (TTP) protein DTIS11,22553461,10.7150/ijbs.3782,"The Tristetraprolin (TTP) protein family includes four mammalian members (TTP, TIS11b, TIS11d, and ZFP36L3), but only one in Drosophila melanogaster (DTIS11). These proteins bind target mRNAs with AU-rich elements (AREs) via two C3H zinc finger domains and destabilize the mRNAs. We found that overexpression of mouse TIS11b or DTIS11 in the Drosophila retina dramatically reduced eye size, similar to the phenotype of eyes absent (eya) mutants. The eya transcript is one of many ARE-containing mRNAs in Drosophila. We showed that TIS11b reduced levels of eya mRNA in vivo. In addition, overexpression of Eya rescued the TIS11b overexpression phenotype. RNA pull-down and luciferase reporter analyses demonstrated that the DTIS11 RNA-binding domain is required for DTIS11 to bind the eya 3' UTR and reduce levels of eya mRNA. Moreover, ectopic expression of DTIS11 in Drosophila S2 cells decreased levels of eya mRNA and reduced cell viability. Consistent with these results, TTP proteins overexpressed in MCF7 human breast cancer cells were associated with eya homologue 2 (EYA2) mRNA, and caused a decrease in EYA2 mRNA stability and cell viability. Our results suggest that eya mRNA is a target of TTP proteins, and that downregulation of EYA by TTP may lead to reduced cell viability in Drosophila and human cells.",2012,"Po-An Yeh, Wen-Hsuan Yang, Pei-Yu Chiang, Shun-Chang Wang, Mau-Sun Chang, Ching-Jin Chang, Po-An Yeh, Wen-Hsuan Yang, Pei-Yu Chiang, Shun-Chang Wang, Mau-Sun Chang, Ching-Jin Chang"
Reduction of germ cells in the Odysseus null mutant causes male fertility defect in Drosophila melanogaster,23229314,10.1266/ggs.87.273,"Odysseus (OdsH) has been identified as a hybrid male sterility gene between Drosophila mauritiana and D. simulans with accelerated evolutionary rate in both expression and DNA sequence. Loss of a testis-specific expression of OdsH causes male fertility defect in D. melanogaster. Yet, the underlying mechanisms at the cellular level are unknown. In an attempt to identify the possible mechanisms and functional roles of OdsH in spermatogenesis, the cell numbers at different developmental stages during spermatogenesis between the OdsH null mutant and wild-type flies were compared. The results showed that the early developing germ cells, including spermatogonia and spermatocytes, were reduced in the OdsH mutant males. In addition, the number of germline stem cells in aged males was also reduced, presumably due to the disruption of germline stem cell maintenance, which resulted in more severe fertility defect. These results suggest that the function of the enhancement of sperm production by OdsH acted across males of all ages.",2012,"Ya-Jen Cheng, Shu Fang, Shun-Chern Tsaur, Yi-Ling Chen, Hua-Wen Fu, Nipam H Patel, Chau-Ti Ting, Ya-Jen Cheng, Shu Fang, Shun-Chern Tsaur, Yi-Ling Chen, Hua-Wen Fu, Nipam H Patel, Chau-Ti Ting"
Nucleolar dominance of the Y chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster,22649076,10.1534/genetics.112.141242,"The rDNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase I to make structural RNAs for ribosomes. Hundreds of rDNA genes are typically arranged in an array that spans megabase pairs of DNA. These arrays are the major sites of transcription in growing cells, accounting for as much as 50% of RNA synthesis. The repetitive rDNA arrays are thought to use heterochromatic gene silencing as a mechanism for metabolic regulation, since repeated sequences nucleate heterochromatin formation in eukaryotes. Drosophila melanogaster carries an rDNA array on the X chromosome and on the Y chromosome, and genetic analysis has suggested that both are transcribed. However, using a chromatin-marking assay, we find that the entire X chromosome rDNA array is normally silenced in D. melanogaster males, while the Y chromosome rDNA array is dominant and expressed. This resembles ""nucleolar dominance,"" a phenomenon that occurs in interspecific hybrids where an rDNA array from one parental species is silenced, and that from the other parent is preferentially transcribed. Interspecies nucleolar dominance is thought to result from incompatibilities between species-specific transcription factors and the rDNA promoters in the hybrid, but our results show that nucleolar dominance is a normal feature of rDNA regulation. Nucleolar dominance within D. melanogaster is only partially dependent on known components of heterochromatic gene silencing, implying that a distinctive chromatin regulatory system may act at rDNA genes. Finally, we isolate variant Y chromosomes that allow X chromosome array expression and suggest that the large-scale organization of rDNA arrays contribute to nucleolar dominance. This is the first example of allelic inactivation in D. melanogaster.",2012,"Frauke Greil, Kami Ahmad"
Alcohol consumption as self-medication against blood-borne parasites in the fruit fly,22342747,10.1016/j.cub.2012.01.045,"Plants and fungi often produce toxic secondary metabolites that limit their consumption, but herbivores and fungivores that evolve resistance gain access to these resources and can also gain protection against nonresistant predators and parasites. Given that Drosophila melanogaster fruit fly larvae consume yeasts growing on rotting fruit and have evolved resistance to fermentation products, we decided to test whether alcohol protects flies from one of their common natural parasites, endoparasitoid wasps. Here, we show that exposure to ethanol reduces wasp oviposition into fruit fly larvae. Furthermore, if infected, ethanol consumption by fruit fly larvae causes increased death of wasp larvae growing in the hemocoel and increased fly survival without need of the stereotypical antiwasp immune response. This multifaceted protection afforded to fly larvae by ethanol is significantly more effective against a generalist wasp than a wasp that specializes on D. melanogaster. Finally, fly larvae seek out ethanol-containing food when infected, indicating that they use alcohol as an antiwasp medicine. Although the high resistance of D. melanogaster may make it uniquely suited to exploit curative properties of alcohol, it is possible that alcohol consumption may have similar protective effects in other organisms.",2012,"Neil F Milan, Balint Z Kacsoh, Todd A Schlenke, Neil F Milan, Balint Z Kacsoh, Todd A Schlenke"
Cyclin G is involved in meiotic recombination repair in Drosophila melanogaster,22976300,10.1242/jcs.113902,"Cyclin G (CycG) belongs to the atypical cyclins, which have diverse cellular functions. The two mammalian CycG genes, CycG1 and CycG2, regulate the cell cycle in response to cell stress. Detailed analyses of the role of the single Drosophila cycG gene have been hampered by the lack of a mutant. We generated a null mutant in the Drosophila cycG gene that is female sterile and produces ventralised eggs. This phenotype is typical of the downregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling during oogenesis. Ventralised eggs are also observed in mutants (for example, mutants of the spindle class) that are defective in meiotic DNA double-strand break repair. Double-strand breaks (DSBs) induce a meiotic checkpoint by activating Mei-41 kinase (the Drosophila ATR homologue), thereby indirectly causing dorsoventral patterning defects. We provide evidence for the role of CycG in meiotic checkpoint control. The increased incidence of DSBs in cycG mutant germaria may reflect inefficient DSB repair. Therefore, the downregulation of Mei-W68 (an endonuclease that induces meiotic DSBs), Mei-41, or Drosophila melanogaster Chk2 (a downstream kinase that initiates the meiotic checkpoint) rescues the cycG mutant eggshell phenotype. In vivo, CycG associates with Rad9 and BRCA2. These two proteins are components of the 9-1-1 complex, which is involved in sensing DSBs and in activating meiotic checkpoint control. Therefore, we propose that CycG has a role in an early step of meiotic recombination repair, thereby affecting EGFR-mediated patterning processes during oogenesis.",2012,"Anja C Nagel, Patrick Fischer, Jutta Szawinski, Martina K La Rosa, Anette Preiss, Anja C Nagel, Patrick Fischer, Jutta Szawinski, Martina K La Rosa, Anette Preiss"
A broad expression profile of the GMR-GAL4 driver in Drosophila melanogaster,22911584,10.4238/2012.August.6.4,"The GAL4/UAS binary system has been widely used in Drosophila melanogaster for ectopic expression of transgenes in a tissue-specific manner. The GMR-GAL4 driver, which expresses the yeast transcription factor GAL4 under the control of glass multiple reporter (GMR) promoter elements, has been commonly utilized to express target transgenes, specifically in the developing eye. However, we have observed abnormal wing phenotypes; this is a result of the activity of critical wing developing genes, e.g., components of the Notch or Wg pathway, that are up- or down-regulated under the control of the GMR-GAL4 driver. X-gal staining confirmed that UAS-LacZ is expressed in third-instar larva wing imaginal discs, as well as in eye discs, when driven by the GMR-GAL4 driver. Furthermore, we found that GMR-GAL4 also drives UAS-LacZ expression in other tissues, such as brain, trachea, and leg discs. These results indicate that GMR-GAL4 has a broad expression profile, rather than the eye-specific pattern described previously, and that one should be careful when using it as a tool for targeted gene expression.",2012,"W-Z Li, S-L Li, H Y Zheng, S-P Zhang, L Xue, W-Z Li, S-L Li, H Y Zheng, S-P Zhang, L Xue"
"Oh, the places they'll go: Female sperm storage and sperm precedence in Drosophila melanogaster",23087839,10.4161/spmg.21655,"Among most animals with internal fertilization, females store sperm in specific regions of their reproductive tract for later use. Sperm storage enables prolonged fertility, physical and temporal separation of mating from fertilization and, when females mate with multiple males, opportunities for differential use of the various males' sperm. Thus, stored sperm move within the female reproductive tract as well as to several potential fates - fertilization, displacement by other sperm or ejection by the female. Drosophila melanogaster is a leading model system for elucidating both the mechanisms and evolutionary consequences of female sperm storage and differential male fertilization success. The prominence of Drosophila is due, in part, to the ability to examine processes influencing sperm movement and fate at several biological levels, from molecules to organ systems.

"Analysis of the transcriptomes downstream of Eyeless and the Hedgehog, Decapentaplegic and Notch signaling pathways in Drosophila melanogaster",22952997,10.1371/journal.pone.0044583,"Tissue-specific transcription factors are thought to cooperate with signaling pathways to promote patterned tissue specification, in part by co-regulating transcription. The Drosophila melanogaster Pax6 homolog Eyeless forms a complex, incompletely understood regulatory network with the Hedgehog, Decapentaplegic and Notch signaling pathways to control eye-specific gene expression. We report a combinatorial approach, including mRNAseq and microarray analyses, to identify targets co-regulated by Eyeless and Hedgehog, Decapentaplegic or Notch. Multiple analyses suggest that the transcriptomes resulting from co-misexpression of Eyeless+signaling factors provide a more complete picture of eye development compared to previous efforts involving Eyeless alone: (1) Principal components analysis and two-way hierarchical clustering revealed that the Eyeless+signaling factor transcriptomes are closer to the eye control transcriptome than when Eyeless is misexpressed alone; (2) more genes are upregulated at least three-fold in response to Eyeless+signaling factors compared to Eyeless alone; (3) based on gene ontology analysis, the genes upregulated in response to Eyeless+signaling factors had a greater diversity of functions compared to Eyeless alone. Through a secondary screen that utilized RNA interference, we show that the predicted gene CG4721 has a role in eye development. CG4721 encodes a neprilysin family metalloprotease that is highly up-regulated in response to Eyeless+Notch, confirming the validity of our approach. Given the similarity between D. melanogaster and vertebrate eye development, the large number of novel genes identified as potential targets of Ey+signaling factors will provide novel insights to our understanding of eye development in D. melanogaster and humans.",2012,"Landry E Nfonsam, Carlos Cano, Joann Mudge, Faye D Schilkey, Jennifer Curtiss, Landry E Nfonsam, Carlos Cano, Joann Mudge, Faye D Schilkey, Jennifer Curtiss"
Inter- and intraspecific variation in Drosophila genes with sex-biased expression,22315698,10.1155/2012/963976,"Genes with sexually dimorphic expression (sex-biased genes) often evolve rapidly and are thought to make an important contribution to reproductive isolation between species. We examined the molecular evolution of sex-biased genes in Drosophila melanogaster and D. ananassae, which represent two independent lineages within the melanogaster group. We find that strong purifying selection limits protein sequence variation within species, but that a considerable fraction of divergence between species can be attributed to positive selection. In D. melanogaster, the proportion of adaptive substitutions between species is greatest for male-biased genes and is especially high for those on the X chromosome. In contrast, male-biased genes do not show unusually high variation within or between populations. A similar pattern is seen at the level of gene expression, where sex-biased genes show high expression divergence between species, but low divergence between populations. In D. ananassae, there is no increased rate of adaptation of male-biased genes, suggesting that the type or strength of selection acting on sex-biased genes differs between lineages.",2012,"Lena MÃ¼ller, Sonja Grath, Korbinian von Heckel, John Parsch, Lena MÃ¼ller, Sonja Grath, Korbinian von Heckel, John Parsch"

Egfr signaling regulates distal as well as medial fate in the embryonic leg of Tribolium castaneum,22921411,10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.08.005,"The evolution of a mechanism to generate a proximal-distal axis perpendicular to the anterior-posterior body axis was a key event in arthropod evolution and facilitated the formation of multi-functional limbs. The study of proximodistal limb patterning in extant arthropods can provide insight into the origin and evolution of the proximal-distal axis. In Drosophila melanogaster, proximal-distal patterning is mainly organized by Wg/Dpp signaling. Egfr signaling is also involved, but is restricted to late stages and distal leg parts (tarsus and pretarsus). Here we study the role of Epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr), spitz (spi), and pointed (pnt) in leg development in the beetle Tribolium castaneum. We show that Egfr signaling has a more complex role in T. castaneum than in D. melanogaster and is not only required in the distal leg, but is also involved in formation of the medial leg (including femur and tibia). Egfr and spi are required for the regulation of clawless (cll), Distal-less (Dll) and dachshund (dac), and RNAi leads to thickened and fused leg segments. Intriguingly, regulation of Dll and dac by Egfr signaling appears functionally separate from its role in cll regulation, because it is not mediated by the transcription factor Pnt. This suggests that Egfr signaling has a dual role with separate mediators in proximodistal axis patterning. While the regulation of distal factors like cll is evolutionarily conserved, regulation of Dll and dac appears to function in parallel or redundant with Wg/Dpp signaling, thus providing a possible explanation why this role is less evolutionarily conserved in the insects.",2012,"Daniela Grossmann, Nikola-Michael Prpic, Daniela Grossmann, Nikola-Michael Prpic"

Unconstrained evolution in short introns? - an analysis of genome-wide polymorphism and divergence data from Drosophila,22901008,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02580.x,"An unconstrained reference sequence facilitates the detection of selection. In Drosophila, sequence variation in short introns seems to be least influenced by selection and dominated by mutation and drift. Here, we test this with genome-wide sequences using an African population (Malawi) of D. melanogaster and data from the related outgroup species D. simulans, D. sechellia, D. erecta and D. yakuba. The distribution of mutations deviates from equilibrium, and the content of A and T (AT) nucleotides shows an excess of variance among introns. We explain this by a complex mutational pattern: a shift in mutational bias towards AT, leading to a slight nonequilibrium in base composition and context-dependent mutation rates, with G or C (GC) sites mutating most frequently in AT-rich introns. By comparing the corresponding allele frequency spectra of AT-rich vs. GC-rich introns, we can rule out the influence of directional selection or biased gene conversion on the mutational pattern. Compared with neutral equilibrium expectations, polymorphism spectra show an excess of low frequency and a paucity of intermediate frequency variants, irrespective of the direction of mutation. Combining the information from different outgroups with the polymorphism data and using a generalized linear model, we find evidence for shared ancestral polymorphism between D. melanogaster and D. simulans, D. sechellia, arguing against a bottleneck in D. melanogaster. Generally, we find that short introns can be used as a neutral reference on a genome-wide level, if the spatially and temporally varying mutational pattern is accounted for.",2012,"F Clemente, C Vogl, F Clemente, C Vogl"

Here we describe an amino-acid INDEL polymorphism in proline repeat number in the structural component of this gene. The two main repeats, accounting for more than 90% of alleles in eastern Australia, show a strong clinal pattern; the 6P allele was at a high frequency in tropical locations, and the 10P allele was common in temperate populations. However, the frequency of these alleles was not associated with three different assays of cold resistance.

Endurance training protocol and longitudinal performance assays for Drosophila melanogaster,22472601,10.3791/3786,"One of the most pressing problems facing modern medical researchers is the surging levels of obesity, with the consequent increase in associated disorders such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease (1-3). An important topic of research into these associated health problems involves the role of endurance exercise as a beneficial intervention. Exercise training is an inexpensive, non-invasive intervention with several beneficial results, including reduction in excess body fat (4), increased insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle (5), increased anti-inflammatory and antioxidative responses (6), and improved contractile capacity in cardiomyocytes (7). Low intensity exercise is known to increase mitochondrial activity and biogenesis in humans (8) and mice, with the transcriptional coactivator PGC1-Î± as an important intermediate (9,10). Despite the importance of exercise as a tool for combating several important age-related diseases, extensive longitudinal genetic studies have been impeded by the lack of an endurance training protocol for a short-lived genetic model species. The variety of genetic tools available for use with Drosophila, together with its short lifespan and inexpensive maintenance, make it an appealing model for further study of these genetic mechanisms. With this in mind we have developed a novel apparatus, known as the Power Tower, for large scale exercise-training in Drosophila melanogaster (11). The Power Tower utilizes the flies' instinctive negative geotaxis behavior to repetitively induce rapid climbing. Each time the machine lifts, then drops, the platform of flies, the flies are induced to climb. Flies continue to respond as long as the machine is in operation or until they become too fatigued to respond. Thus, the researcher can use this machine to provide simultaneous training to large numbers of age-matched and genetically identical flies. Additionally, we describe associated assays useful to track longitudinal progress of fly cohorts during training.",2012,"Martin J Tinkerhess, Sara Ginzberg, Nicole Piazza, Robert J Wessells, Martin J Tinkerhess, Sara Ginzberg, Nicole Piazza, Robert J Wessells"

Geographical delimitation of a partial selective sweep in African Drosophila melanogaster,23110353,10.1111/mec.12004,"Positive selection leaves characteristic footprints on DNA variation but detecting such patterns is challenging as the age, the intensity and the mode of selection as well as demography and evolutionary parameters (mutation and recombination rates) all play roles and these are difficult to disentangle. We recorded nucleotide variation in a sample of isogenic chromosomes from a western African population of Drosophila melanogaster at a locus (Fbp2) for which a partial selective sweep had previously been reported. We compared this locus to four other genes from the same chromosomes and from a European and an East African population. Then, we assessed Fbp2 variation in a sample of 370 chromosomes covering a comprehensive geographic sampling of 16 African localities. The signature of selection was tested while accounting for the demographic history of the populations. We found a significant signal of selection in two West African localities including Ivory Coast. Variation at Fpb2 would thus represent a case of an ongoing selective sweep in the range of this species. A weaker, nonsignificant, signal of selection was, however, apparent in some other populations, thus leaving open several possibilities: (i) the selective sweep originated in Ivory Coast and has spread to the rest of the continent; (ii) several African populations report the signature of a selective event having occurred in an ancestral population; (iii) this genome region is subject to independent selective events in African populations; and (iv) A neutral scenario with population subdivision and local bottleneck cannot be fully excluded to explain the molecular patterns observed in some populations.",2012,"L Frezal, F Meli, S Mousset, S Mona, M Veuille, L Frezal, F Meli, S Mousset, S Mona, M Veuille"
Smelling on the fly: sensory cues and strategies for olfactory navigation in Drosophila,22221864,10.1016/j.conb.2011.12.010,"Navigating toward (or away from) a remote odor source is a challenging problem that requires integrating olfactory information with visual and mechanosensory cues. Drosophila melanogaster is a useful organism for studying the neural mechanisms of these navigation behaviors. There are a wealth of genetic tools in this organism, as well as a history of inventive behavioral experiments. There is also a large and growing literature in Drosophila on the neural coding of olfactory, visual, and mechanosensory stimuli. Here we review recent progress in understanding how these stimulus modalities are encoded in the Drosophila nervous system. We also discuss what strategies a fly might use to navigate in a natural olfactory landscape while making use of all these sources of sensory information. We emphasize that Drosophila are likely to switch between multiple strategies for olfactory navigation, depending on the availability of various sensory cues. Finally, we highlight future research directions that will be important in understanding the neural circuits that underlie these behaviors.",2012,"Quentin Gaudry, Katherine I Nagel, Rachel I Wilson, Quentin Gaudry, Katherine I Nagel, Rachel I Wilson"
Functional study of hyperpolarization activated channel (Ih) in Drosophila behavior,22314484,10.1007/s11427-012-4270-6,"Hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated and cation-nonselective ion channels (I ( h ) channels, or HCN channels) are known to play important roles in mammals. Their physiological functions in invertebrate remain largely unclear. Here, we report our studies with I ( h ) channel in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila Ih channel mutants are found with several defects by behavioral analyses. Their lifespan is reduced, and their chemical sensitivity is shifted. In addition, their length of sleep at light-dark condition is mildly reduced. We generated transgenic flies of I ( h ) promoter-driven Gal4 and examined its expression pattern in both larvae and adult flies.

Proteomic characterization of inbreeding-related cold sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster,23658762,10.1371/journal.pone.0062680,"Inbreeding depression is a widespread phenomenon of central importance to agriculture, medicine, conservation biology and evolutionary biology. Although the population genetic principles of inbreeding depression are well understood, we know little about its functional genomic causes. To provide insight into the molecular interplay between intrinsic stress responses, inbreeding depression and temperature tolerance, we performed a proteomic characterization of a well-defined conditional inbreeding effect in a single line of Drosophila melanogaster, which suffers from extreme cold sensitivity and lethality. We identified 48 differentially expressed proteins in a conditional lethal line as compared to two control lines. These proteins were enriched for proteins involved in hexose metabolism, in particular pyruvate metabolism, and many were found to be associated with lipid particles. These processes can be linked to known cold tolerance mechanisms, such as the production of cryoprotectants, membrane remodeling and the build-up of energy reserves. We checked mRNA-expression of seven genes with large differential protein expression. Although protein expression poorly correlated with gene expression, we found a single gene (CG18067) that, after cold shock, was upregulated in the conditional lethal line both at the mRNA and protein level. Expression of CG18067 also increased in control flies after cold shock, and has previously been linked to cold exposure and chill coma recovery time. Many differentially expressed proteins in our study appear to be involved in cold tolerance in non-inbred individuals. This suggest the conditional inbreeding effect to be caused by misregulation of physiological cold tolerance mechanisms.",2013,"Cornelis J Vermeulen, Kamilla S Pedersen, Hans C Beck, JÃ¸rgen Petersen, Kristina Kirilova Gagalova, Volker Loeschcke, Cornelis J Vermeulen, Kamilla S Pedersen, Hans C Beck, JÃ¸rgen Petersen, Kristina Kirilova Gagalova, Volker Loeschcke"
High-fidelity promoter profiling reveals widespread alternative promoter usage and transposon-driven developmental gene expression,22936248,10.1101/gr.139618.112,"Many eukaryotic genes possess multiple alternative promoters with distinct expression specificities. Therefore, comprehensively annotating promoters and deciphering their individual regulatory dynamics is critical for gene expression profiling applications and for our understanding of regulatory complexity. We introduce RAMPAGE, a novel promoter activity profiling approach that combines extremely specific 5'-complete cDNA sequencing with an integrated data analysis workflow, to address the limitations of current techniques. RAMPAGE features a streamlined protocol for fast and easy generation of highly multiplexed sequencing libraries, offers very high transcription start site specificity, generates accurate and reproducible promoter expression measurements, and yields extensive transcript connectivity information through paired-end cDNA sequencing. We used RAMPAGE in a genome-wide study of promoter activity throughout 36 stages of the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster, and describe here a comprehensive data set that represents the first available developmental time-course of promoter usage. We found that >40% of developmentally expressed genes have at least two promoters and that alternative promoters generally implement distinct regulatory programs. Transposable elements, long proposed to play a central role in the evolution of their host genomes through their ability to regulate gene expression, contribute at least 1300 promoters shaping the developmental transcriptome of D. melanogaster. Hundreds of these promoters drive the expression of annotated genes, and transposons often impart their own expression specificity upon the genes they regulate. These observations provide support for the theory that transposons may drive regulatory innovation through the distribution of stereotyped cis-regulatory modules throughout their host genomes.",2013,"Philippe Batut, Alexander Dobin, Charles Plessy, Piero Carninci, Thomas R Gingeras, Philippe Batut, Alexander Dobin, Charles Plessy, Piero Carninci, Thomas R Gingeras"

Combined inhibition of autophagy and caspases fails to prevent developmental nurse cell death in the Drosophila melanogaster ovary,24098761,10.1371/journal.pone.0076046,"During the final stages of Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis fifteen nurse cells, sister cells to the oocyte, degenerate as part of normal development. This process involves at least two cell death mechanisms, caspase-dependent cell death and autophagy, as indicated by apoptosis and autophagy markers. In addition, mutations affecting either caspases or autophagy partially reduce nurse cell removal, leaving behind end-stage egg chambers with persisting nurse cell nuclei. To determine whether apoptosis and autophagy work in parallel to degrade and remove these cells as is the case with salivary glands during pupariation, we generated mutants doubly affecting caspases and autophagy. We found no significant increase in either the number of late stage egg chambers containing persisting nuclei or in the number of persisting nuclei per egg chamber in the double mutants compared to single mutants. These findings suggest that there is another cell death mechanism functioning in the ovary to remove all nurse cell remnants from late stage egg chambers.",2013,"Jeanne S Peterson, Kimberly McCall, Jeanne S Peterson, Kimberly McCall"
Short indels are subject to insertion-biased gene conversion,24033170,10.1111/evo.12129,"Recombination between homologous loci is accompanied by formation of heteroduplexes. Repairing mismatches in heteroduplexes often leads to single nucleotide substitutions in a process known as gene conversion. Gene conversion was shown to be GC-biased in different organisms; that is, a W(A or T)?S(G or C) substitution is more likely in this process than a S?W substitution. Here, we show that the insertion/deletion ratio for short noncoding indels that reach fixation between species is positively correlated with the recombination rate in Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This correlation is both due to an increase of the fixation rate of insertions and decrease of the fixation rate of deletions in regions of high recombination. Whole-genome data on indel polymorphism and divergence in D. melanogaster rule out mutation biases and selection as the cause of this trend, pointing to insertion-biased gene conversion as the most likely explanation. The bias toward insertions is the strongest for single-nucleotide indels, and decreases with indel length. In regions of high recombination rate this bias leads to an up to ??-fold excess of fixed short insertions over deletions, and substantially affects the evolution of DNA segments.",2013,"Evgeny V Leushkin, Georgii A Bazykin, Evgeny V Leushkin, Georgii A Bazykin"
Epigenetics and sex-specific fitness: an experimental test using male-limited evolution in Drosophila melanogaster,23922998,10.1371/journal.pone.0070493,"When males and females have different fitness optima for the same trait but share loci, intralocus sexual conflict is likely to occur. Epigenetic mechanisms such as genomic imprinting (in which expression is altered according to parent-of-origin) and sex-specific maternal effects have been suggested as ways by which this conflict can be resolved. However these ideas have not yet been empirically tested. We designed an experimental evolution protocol in Drosophila melanogaster that enabled us to look for epigenetic effects on the X-chromosome-a hotspot for sexually antagonistic loci. We used special compound-X females to enforce father-to-son transmission of the X-chromosome for many generations, and compared fitness and gene expression levels between Control males, males with a Control X-chromosome that had undergone one generation of father-son transmission, and males with an X-chromosome that had undergone many generations of father-son transmission. Fitness differences were dramatic, with experimentally-evolved males approximately 20% greater than controls, and with males inheriting a non-evolved X from their father about 20% lower than controls. These data are consistent with both strong intralocus sexual conflict and misimprinting of the X-chromosome under paternal inheritance. However, expression differences suggested that reduced fitness under paternal X inheritance was largely due to deleterious maternal effects. Our data confirm the sexually-antagonistic nature of Drosophila's X-chromosome and suggest that the response to male-limited X-chromosome evolution entails compensatory evolution for maternal effects, and perhaps modification of other epigenetic effects via coevolution of the sex chromosomes.",2013,"Jessica K Abbott, Paolo Innocenti, Adam K Chippindale, Edward H Morrow, Jessica K Abbott, Paolo Innocenti, Adam K Chippindale, Edward H Morrow"

Transcriptomic analysis provides insights on hexavalent chromium induced DNA double strand breaks and their possible repair in midgut cells of Drosophila melanogaster larvae,23628323,10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2013.04.005,"Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is a well known mutagen and carcinogen. Since genomic instability due to generation of double strand breaks (DSBs) is causally linked to carcinogenesis, we tested a hypothesis that Cr(VI) causes in vivo generation of DSBs and elicits DNA damage response. We fed repair proficient Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon R(+)) larvae Cr(VI) (20.0Î¼g/ml) mixed food for 24 and 48h and observed a significant (p<0.05) induction of DSBs in their midgut cells after 48h using neutral Comet assay. Global gene expression profiling in Cr(VI)-exposed Oregon R(+) larvae unveiled mis-regulation of DSBs responsive repair genes both after 24 and 48h. In vivo generation of DSBs in exposed Drosophila was confirmed by an increased pH2Av immunostaining along with the activation of cell cycle regulation genes. Analysis of mis-regulated genes grouped under DSB response by GOEAST indicated the participation of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DSB repair pathway. We selected two strains, one mutant (ligIV) and another ku80-RNAi (knockdown of ku80), whose functions are essentially linked to NHEJ-DSB repair pathway. As a proof of principle, we compared the DSBs generation in larvae of these two strains with that of repair proficient Oregon R(+). Along with this, DSBs generation in spn-A and okr [essential genes in homologous recombination repair (HR) pathway] mutants was also tested for the possible involvement of HR-DSB repair. A significantly increased DSBs generation in the exposed ku80-RNAi and ligIV (mutant) larvae because of impaired repair, concomitant with an insignificant DSBs generation in okr and spn-A mutant larvae indicates an active participation of NHEJ repair pathway. The study, first of its kind to our knowledge, while providing evidences for in vivo generation of DSBs in Cr(VI) exposed Drosophila larvae, assumes significance for its relevance to higher organisms due to causal link between DSB generation and Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis.",2013,"Manish Mishra, A Sharma, A K Shukla, P Pragya, R C Murthy, David de Pomerai, U N Dwivedi, D Kar Chowdhuri, Manish Mishra, A Sharma, A K Shukla, P Pragya, R C Murthy, David de Pomerai, U N Dwivedi, D Kar Chowdhuri"

Cu dyshomeostasis has also been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Over the last decade, the fly Drosophila melanogaster has become an important model organism for the elucidation of eukaryotic Cu regulatory mechanisms.

Mortality from desiccation contributes to a genotype-temperature interaction for cold survival in Drosophila melanogaster,23197100,10.1242/jeb.076539,"Survival at cold temperatures is a complex trait, primarily because of the fact that the physiological cause of injury may differ across degrees of cold exposure experienced within the lifetime of an ectothermic individual. In order to better understand how chill-sensitive insects experience and adapt to low temperatures, we investigated the physiological basis for cold survival across a range of temperature exposures from -4 to 6Â°C in five genetic lines of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic effects on cold survival were temperature dependent and resulted in a significant genotype-temperature interaction for survival across cold temperature exposures that differ by as little as 2Â°C. We investigated desiccation as a potential mechanism of injury across these temperature exposures. Flies were dehydrated following exposures near 6Â°C, whereas flies were not dehydrated following exposures near -4Â°C. Furthermore, decreasing humidity during cold exposure decreased survival, and increasing humidity during cold exposure increased survival at 6Â°C, but not at -4Â°C. These results support the conclusion that in D. melanogaster there are multiple physiological mechanisms of cold-induced mortality across relatively small differences in temperature, and that desiccation contributes to mortality for exposures near 6Â°C but not for subzero temperatures. Because D. melanogaster has recently expanded its range from tropical to temperate latitudes, the complex physiologies underlying cold tolerance are likely to be important traits in the recent evolutionary history of this fruit fly.",2013,"Robert L Kobey, Kristi L Montooth, Robert L Kobey, Kristi L Montooth"
Drosophila rae1 is required for male meiosis and spermatogenesis,23788425,10.1242/jcs.111328,"Previous studies of RAE1, a conserved WD40 protein, in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and mouse revealed a role in mRNA export and cell cycle progression in mitotic cells. Studies of RAE1 in Drosophila showed that the protein localizes to the nuclear envelope and is required for progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle but not RNA export in tissue culture cells. Drosophila RAE1 also plays an essential developmental role, as it is required for viability and synaptic growth regulation as a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Here we describe characterization of a new Drosophila rae1 mutant that is viable but results in male sterility. The mutant showed striking defects in primary spermatocyte nuclear integrity, meiotic chromosome condensation, segregation, and spindle morphology. These defects led to a failure to complete meiosis but allowed several aspects of spermatid differentiation to proceed, including axoneme formation and elongation. A GFP-RAE1 fusion protein that rescued most of the cytological defects showed a dynamic localization to the nuclear envelope, chromatin and other structures depending on the stage of spermatogenesis. A role for RAE1 in male meiosis, as well as mitotic cells, was also indicated by the defects induced by expression of rae1-RNAi. These studies in Drosophila provide the first evidence for an essential meiotic role of RAE1, and thus define RAE1 as a protein required for both meiotic and mitotic cell cycles.",2013,"Silvia Volpi, Silvia Bongiorni, Fabiana Fabbretti, Barbara T Wakimoto, Giorgio Prantera, Silvia Volpi, Silvia Bongiorni, Fabiana Fabbretti, Barbara T Wakimoto, Giorgio Prantera"

GABA(B) receptors play an essential role in maintaining sleep during the second half of the night in Drosophila melanogaster,24068350,10.1242/jeb.085563,"GABAergic signalling is important for normal sleep in humans and flies. Here we advance the current understanding of GABAergic modulation of daily sleep patterns by focusing on the role of slow metabotropic GABAB receptors in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We asked whether GABAB-R2 receptors are regulatory elements in sleep regulation in addition to the already identified fast ionotropic Rdl GABAA receptors. By immunocytochemical and reporter-based techniques we show that the pigment dispersing factor (PDF)-positive ventrolateral clock neurons (LNv) express GABAB-R2 receptors. Downregulation of GABAB-R2 receptors in the large PDF neurons (l-LNv) by RNAi reduced sleep maintenance in the second half of the night, whereas sleep latency at the beginning of the night that was previously shown to depend on ionotropic Rdl GABAA receptors remained unaltered. Our results confirm the role of the l-LNv neurons as an important part of the sleep circuit in D. melanogaster and also identify the GABAB-R2 receptors as the thus far missing component in GABA-signalling that is essential for sleep maintenance. Despite the significant effects on sleep, we did not observe any changes in circadian behaviour in flies with downregulated GABAB-R2 receptors, indicating that the regulation of sleep maintenance via l-LNv neurons is independent of their function in the circadian clock circuit.",2013,"Florian Gmeiner, Agata Ko?odziejczyk, Taishi Yoshii, Dirk Rieger, Dick R NÃ¤ssel, Charlotte Helfrich-FÃ¶rster, Florian Gmeiner, Agata Ko?odziejczyk, Taishi Yoshii, Dirk Rieger, Dick R NÃ¤ssel, Charlotte Helfrich-FÃ¶rster"
Predatory cannibalism in Drosophila melanogaster larvae,23653201,10.1038/ncomms2744,"Hunting live prey is risky and thought to require specialized adaptations. Therefore, observations of predatory cannibalism in otherwise non-carnivorous animals raise questions about its function, adaptive significance and evolutionary potential. Here we document predatory cannibalism on larger conspecifics in Drosophila melanogaster larvae and address its evolutionary significance. We found that under crowded laboratory conditions younger larvae regularly attack and consume 'wandering-stage' conspecifics, forming aggregations mediated by chemical cues from the attacked victim. Nutrition gained this way can be significant: an exclusively cannibalistic diet was sufficient for normal development from eggs to fertile adults. Cannibalistic diet also induced plasticity of larval mouth parts. Finally, during 118 generations of experimental evolution, replicated populations maintained under larval malnutrition evolved enhanced propensity towards cannibalism. These results suggest that, at least under laboratory conditions, predation on conspecifics in Drosophila is a functional, adaptive behaviour, which can rapidly evolve in response to nutritional conditions.",2013,"Roshan K Vijendravarma, Sunitha Narasimha, Tadeusz J Kawecki, Roshan K Vijendravarma, Sunitha Narasimha, Tadeusz J Kawecki"
Male killing Spiroplasma preferentially disrupts neural development in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo,24236124,10.1371/journal.pone.0079368,"Male killing bacteria such as Spiroplasma are widespread pathogens of numerous arthropods including Drosophila melanogaster. These maternally transmitted bacteria can bias host sex ratios toward the female sex in order to 'selfishly' enhance bacterial transmission. However, little is known about the specific means by which these pathogens disrupt host development in order to kill males. Here we show that a male-killing Spiroplasma strain severely disrupts nervous tissue development in male but not female D. melanogaster embryos. The neuroblasts, or neuron progenitors, form properly and their daughter cells differentiate into neurons of the ventral nerve chord. However, the neurons fail to pack together properly and they produce highly abnormal axons. In contrast, non-neural tissue, such as mesoderm, and body segmentation appear normal during this time, although the entire male embryo becomes highly abnormal during later stages. Finally, we found that Spiroplasma is altogether absent from the neural tissue but localizes within the gut and the epithelium immediately surrounding the neural tissue, suggesting that the bacterium secretes a toxin that affects neural tissue development across tissue boundaries. Together these findings demonstrate the unique ability of this insect pathogen to preferentially affect development of a specific embryonic tissue to induce male killing.",2013,"Jennifer Martin, Trisha Chong, Patrick M Ferree, Jennifer Martin, Trisha Chong, Patrick M Ferree"
A comparative analysis of transcription factor expression during metazoan embryonic development,23799133,10.1371/journal.pone.0066826,"During embryonic development, a complex organism is formed from a single starting cell. These processes of growth and differentiation are driven by large transcriptional changes, which are following the expression and activity of transcription factors (TFs). This study sought to compare TF expression during embryonic development in a diverse group of metazoan animals: representatives of vertebrates (Danio rerio, Xenopus tropicalis), a chordate (Ciona intestinalis) and invertebrate phyla such as insects (Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae) and nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) were sampled, The different species showed overall very similar TF expression patterns, with TF expression increasing during the initial stages of development. C2H2 zinc finger TFs were over-represented and Homeobox TFs were under-represented in the early stages in all species. We further clustered TFs for each species based on their quantitative temporal expression profiles. This showed very similar TF expression trends in development in vertebrate and insect species. However, analysis of the expression of orthologous pairs between more closely related species showed that expression of most individual TFs is not conserved, following the general model of duplication and diversification. The degree of similarity between TF expression between Xenopus tropicalis and Danio rerio followed the hourglass model, with the greatest similarity occuring during the early tailbud stage in Xenopus tropicalis and the late segmentation stage in Danio rerio. However, for Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae there were two periods of high TF transcriptome similarity, one during the Arthropod phylotypic stage at 8-10 hours into Drosophila development and the other later at 16-18 hours into Drosophila development.",2013,"Alicia N Schep, Boris Adryan, Alicia N Schep, Boris Adryan"
Abdominal-B and caudal inhibit the formation of specific neuroblasts in the Drosophila tail region,23903193,10.1242/dev.096099,"The central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster consists of fused segmental units (neuromeres), each generated by a characteristic number of neural stem cells (neuroblasts). In the embryo, thoracic and anterior abdominal neuromeres are almost equally sized and formed by repetitive sets of neuroblasts, whereas the terminal abdominal neuromeres are generated by significantly smaller populations of progenitor cells. Here we investigated the role of the Hox gene Abdominal-B in shaping the terminal neuromeres. We show that the regulatory isoform of Abdominal-B (Abd-B.r) not only confers abdominal fate to specific neuroblasts (e.g. NB6-4) and regulates programmed cell death of several progeny cells within certain neuroblast lineages (e.g. NB3-3) in parasegment 14, but also inhibits the formation of a specific set of neuroblasts in parasegment 15 (including NB7-3). We further show that Abd-B.r requires cooperation of the ParaHox gene caudal to unfold its full competence concerning neuroblast inhibition and specification. Thus, our findings demonstrate that combined action of Abdominal-B and caudal contributes to the size and composition of the terminal neuromeres by regulating both the number and lineages of specific neuroblasts.",2013,"Oliver Birkholz, Olaf Vef, Ana Rogulja-Ortmann, Christian Berger, Gerhard M Technau, Oliver Birkholz, Olaf Vef, Ana Rogulja-Ortmann, Christian Berger, Gerhard M Technau"
Sex-biased networks and nodes of sexually antagonistic conflict in Drosophila,23431497,10.1155/2013/545392,"Sexual antagonism, or conflict, can occur when males and females harbor opposing reproductive strategies. The large fraction of sex-biased genes in genomes present considerable opportunities for conflict to occur, suggesting that sexual antagonism may potentially be a general phenomenon at the molecular level. Here, we employ a novel strategy to identify potential nodes of sexual conflict in Drosophila melanogaster by coupling male, female, and sex-unbiased networks derived from genome-wide expression data with available genetic and protein interaction data. We find that sex-biased networks comprise a large fraction (~1/3) of the total interaction network with the male network possessing nearly twice the number of nodes (genes) relative to the female network. However, there are far less edges or interaction partners among male relative to female subnetworks as seen in their power law distributions. We further identified 598 sex-unbiased genes that can act as indirect nodes of interlocus sexual conflict as well as 271 direct nodal pairs of potential conflict between male- and female-biased genes. The pervasiveness of such potentially conflicting nodes may explain the rapid evolution of sex-biased as well as non-sex-biased genes via this molecular mechanism of sexual selection even among taxa such as Drosophila that are nominally sexually dimorphic.",2013,"Matthew E B Hansen, Rob J Kulathinal, Matthew E B Hansen, Rob J Kulathinal"

A targeted genetic modifier screen links the SWI2/SNF2 protein domino to growth and autophagy genes in Drosophila melanogaster,23550128,10.1534/g3.112.005496,"Targeted genetic studies can facilitate phenotypic analyses and provide important insights into development and other complex processes.

These include hematopoiesis, cell proliferation, homeotic gene regulation, histone exchange during DNA repair, and Notch signaling. To explore the wider gene network associated with Dom action, we used RNAi directed against domino (dom) to mediate loss-of-function at the wing margin, a tissue that is readily scored for phenotypic changes. Dom RNAi driven through GAL4-UAS elicited dominant wing nicking that responded phenotypically to the dose of dom and other loci known to function with dom. We screened for phenotypic modifiers of this wing phenotype among 2500 transpositions of the EP P element and found both enhancers and suppressors. Several classes of modifier were obtained, including those encoding transcription factors, RNA regulatory proteins, and factors that regulate cell growth, proliferation and autophagy, a lysosomal degradation pathway that affects cell growth under conditions of starvation and stress. Our analysis is consistent with prior studies, suggesting that Dom acts pleiotropically as a positive effector of Notch signaling and a repressor of proliferation. This genetic system should facilitate screens for additional loci associated with Dom function, and complement biochemical approaches to their regulatory activity.",2013,"Matt Hyoung Kwon, Heather Callaway, Jim Zhong, Barry Yedvobnick, Matt Hyoung Kwon, Heather Callaway, Jim Zhong, Barry Yedvobnick"
The development of a monoclonal antibody recognizing the Drosophila melanogaster phosphorylated histone H2A variant (Î³-H2AV),23833215,10.1534/g3.113.006833,"The recognition of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) using a phospho-specific antibody to the histone 2A variant has become the gold standard assay for DNA damage detection.

These studies show that the antibody derived in the study is highly specific for this modification that occurs at DSB sites, and therefore will be a new useful tool within the Drosophila community for the study of DNA damage response, DSB repair, meiotic recombination and chemical agents that cause DNA damage.",2013,"Cathleen M Lake, Julie Korda Holsclaw, Stephanie P Bellendir, Jeff Sekelsky, R Scott Hawley, Cathleen M Lake, Julie Korda Holsclaw, Stephanie P Bellendir, Jeff Sekelsky, R Scott Hawley"
NOT10 and C2orf29/NOT11 form a conserved module of the CCR4-NOT complex that docks onto the NOT1 N-terminal domain,23303381,10.4161/rna.23018,"The CCR4-NOT complex plays a crucial role in post-transcriptional mRNA regulation in eukaryotes. This complex catalyzes the removal of mRNA poly(A) tails, thereby repressing translation and committing an mRNA to degradation. The conserved core of the complex is assembled by the interaction of at least two modules: the NOT module, which minimally consists of NOT1, NOT2 and NOT3, and a catalytic module comprising two deadenylases, CCR4 and POP2/CAF1. Additional complex subunits include CAF40 and two newly identified human subunits, NOT10 and C2orf29. The role of the NOT10 and C2orf29 subunits and how they are integrated into the complex are unknown. Here, we show that the Drosophila melanogaster NOT10 and C2orf29 orthologs form a complex that interacts with the N-terminal domain of NOT1 through C2orf29. These interactions are conserved in human cells, indicating that NOT10 and C2orf29 define a conserved module of the CCR4-NOT complex. We further investigated the assembly of the D. melanogaster CCR4-NOT complex, and demonstrate that the conserved armadillo repeat domain of CAF40 interacts with a region of NOT1, comprising a domain of unknown function, DUF3819. Using tethering assays, we show that each subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex causes translational repression of an unadenylated mRNA reporter and deadenylation and degradation of a polyadenylated reporter. Therefore, the recruitment of a single subunit of the complex to an mRNA target induces the assembly of the complete CCR4-NOT complex, resulting in a similar regulatory outcome.",2013,"Praveen Bawankar, Belinda Loh, Lara Wohlbold, Steffen Schmidt, Elisa Izaurralde, Praveen Bawankar, Belinda Loh, Lara Wohlbold, Steffen Schmidt, Elisa Izaurralde"
"The RNA export factor, Nxt1, is required for tissue specific transcriptional regulation",23754955,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003526,"The highly conserved, Nxf/Nxt (TAP/p15) RNA nuclear export pathway is important for export of most mRNAs from the nucleus, by interacting with mRNAs and promoting their passage through nuclear pores. Nxt1 is essential for viability; using a partial loss of function allele, we reveal a role for this gene in tissue specific transcription. We show that many Drosophila melanogaster testis-specific mRNAs require Nxt1 for their accumulation. The transcripts that require Nxt1 also depend on a testis-specific transcription complex, tMAC. We show that loss of Nxt1 leads to reduced transcription of tMAC targets. A reporter transcript from a tMAC-dependent promoter is under-expressed in Nxt1 mutants, however the same transcript accumulates in mutants if driven by a tMAC-independent promoter. Thus, in Drosophila primary spermatocytes, the transcription factor used to activate expression of a transcript, rather than the RNA sequence itself or the core transcription machinery, determines whether this expression requires Nxt1. We additionally find that transcripts from intron-less genes are more sensitive to loss of Nxt1 function than those from intron-containing genes and propose a mechanism in which transcript processing feeds back to increase activity of a tissue specific transcription complex.",2013,"Simona Caporilli, Yachuan Yu, Jianqiao Jiang, Helen White-Cooper, Simona Caporilli, Yachuan Yu, Jianqiao Jiang, Helen White-Cooper"
Ionotropic receptors (IRs): chemosensory ionotropic glutamate receptors in Drosophila and beyond,23459169,10.1016/j.ibmb.2013.02.007,"Ionotropic Receptors (IRs) are a recently characterized family of olfactory receptors in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.

Here, we review the expression and function of IRs in Drosophila, highlighting similarities and differences with iGluRs. We also briefly describe the organization of the neuronal circuits in which IRs function, comparing and contrasting them with the sensory pathways expressing ORs.

A nutritional conditional lethal mutant due to pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase deficiency in Drosophila melanogaster,24739647,10.1534/g3.114.011130,"The concept of auxotrophic complementation has been proposed as an approach to identify genes in essential metabolic pathways in Drosophila melanogaster. However, it has achieved limited success to date, possibly due to the low probability of finding mutations fit with the chemically defined profile. Instead of using the chemically defined culture media lacking specific nutrients, we used bare minimum culture medium, i.e., 4% sucrose, for adult Drosophila. We identified a nutritional conditional lethal mutant and localized a c.95C > A mutation in the Drosophila pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase gene [dPNPO or sugarlethal (sgll)] using meiotic recombination mapping, deficiency mapping, and whole genome sequencing. PNPO converts dietary vitamin B6 such as pyridoxine to its active form pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). The missense mutation (sgll(95)) results in the substitution of alanine to aspartate (p.Ala32Asp). The sgll(95) flies survive well on complete medium but all die within 6 d on 4% sucrose only diet, which can be rescued by pyridoxine or PLP supplement, suggesting that the mutation does not cause the complete loss of PNPO activity. The sgll knockdown further confirms its function as the Drosophila PNPO. Because better tools for positional cloning and cheaper whole genome sequencing have made the identification of point mutations much easier than before, alleviating the necessity to pinpoint specific metabolic pathways before gene identification, we propose that nutritional conditional screens based on bare minimum growth media like ours represent promising approaches for discovering important genes and mutations in metabolic pathways, thereby accelerating the establishment of in vivo models that recapitulate human metabolic diseases.",2014,"Wanhao Chi, Li Zhang, Wei Du, Xiaoxi Zhuang, Wanhao Chi, Li Zhang, Wei Du, Xiaoxi Zhuang"
The extracellular matrix protein artichoke is required for integrity of ciliated mechanosensory and chemosensory organs in Drosophila embryos,24496014,10.1534/genetics.113.156323,"Sensory cilia are often encapsulated by an extracellular matrix (ECM). In Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and vertebrates, this ECM is thought to be directly involved in ciliary mechanosensing by coupling external forces to the ciliary membrane. Drosophila mechano- and chemosensory cilia are both associated with an ECM, indicating that the ECM may have additional roles that go beyond mechanosensory cilium function. Here, we identify Artichoke (ATK), an evolutionarily conserved leucine-rich repeat ECM protein that is required for normal morphogenesis and function of ciliated sensilla in Drosophila. atk is transiently expressed in accessory cells in all ciliated sensory organs during their late embryonic development. Antibody stainings show ATK protein in the ECM that surrounds sensory cilia. Loss of ATK protein in atk null mutants leads to cilium deformation and disorientation in chordotonal organs, apparently without uncoupling the cilia from the ECM, and consequently to locomotion defects. Moreover, impaired chemotaxis in atk mutant larvae suggests that, based on ATK protein localization, the ECM is also crucial for the correct assembly of chemosensory receptors. In addition to defining a novel ECM component, our findings show the importance of ECM integrity for the proper morphogenesis of ciliated organs in different sensory modalities.",2014,"Marta AndrÃ©s, Enrique TuriÃ©gano, Martin C GÃ¶pfert, Inmaculada Canal, Laura Torroja, Marta AndrÃ©s, Enrique TuriÃ©gano, Martin C GÃ¶pfert, Inmaculada Canal, Laura Torroja"
A new genome-wide method to track horizontally transferred sequences: application to Drosophila,24497602,10.1093/gbe/evu026,"Because of methodological breakthroughs and the availability of an increasing amount of whole-genome sequence data, horizontal transfers (HTs) in eukaryotes have received much attention recently. Contrary to similar analyses in prokaryotes, most studies in eukaryotes usually investigate particular sequences corresponding to transposable elements (TEs), neglecting the other components of the genome. We present a new methodological framework for the genome-wide detection of all putative horizontally transferred sequences between two species that requires no prior knowledge of the transferred sequences. This method provides a broader picture of HTs in eukaryotes by fully exploiting complete-genome sequence data. In contrast to previous genome-wide approaches, we used a well-defined statistical framework to control for the number of false positives in the results, and we propose two new validation procedures to control for confounding factors. The first validation procedure relies on a comparative analysis with other species of the phylogeny to validate HTs for the nonrepeated sequences detected, whereas the second one built upon the study of the dynamics of the detected TEs. We applied our method to two closely related Drosophila species, Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans, in which we discovered 10 new HTs in addition to all the HTs previously detected in different studies, which underscores our method's high sensitivity and specificity. Our results favor the hypothesis of multiple independent HTs of TEs while unraveling a small portion of the network of HTs in the Drosophila phylogeny.",2014,"Laurent Modolo, Franck Picard, Emmanuelle Lerat, Laurent Modolo, Franck Picard, Emmanuelle Lerat"

Pigmentation in Drosophila melanogaster reaches its maximum in Ethiopia and correlates most strongly with ultra-violet radiation in sub-Saharan Africa,25115161,10.1186/s12862-014-0179-y,"Background:
      
    

    
      Pigmentation has a long history of investigation in evolutionary biology. In Drosophila melanogaster, latitudinal and altitudinal clines have been found but their underlying causes remain unclear. Moreover, most studies were conducted on cosmopolitan populations which have a relatively low level of genetic structure and diversity compared to sub-Saharan African populations. We investigated: 1) the correlation between pigmentation traits within and between the thorax and the fourth abdominal segment, and 2) their associations with different geographical and ecological variables, using 710 lines belonging to 30 sub-Saharan and cosmopolitan populations.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Pigmentation clines substantially differed between sub-Saharan and cosmopolitan populations. While positive correlations with latitude have previously been described in Europe, India and Australia, in agreement with Bogert's rule or the thermal melanism hypothesis, we found a significant negative correlation in Africa. This correlation persisted even after correction for altitude, which in its turn showed a positive correlation with pigmentation independently from latitude. More importantly, we found that thoracic pigmentation reaches its maximal values in this species in high-altitude populations of Ethiopia (1,600-3,100 m). Ethiopian flies have a diffuse wide thoracic trident making the mesonotum and the head almost black, a phenotype that is absent from all other sub-Saharan or cosmopolitan populations including high-altitude flies from Peru (~3,400 m). Ecological analyses indicated that the variable most predictive of pigmentation in Africa, especially for the thorax, was ultra-violet (UV) intensity, consistent with the so-called Gloger's rule invoking a role of melanin in UV protection.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:

Do candidate genes mediating conspecific sperm precedence affect sperm competitive ability within species? A test case in Drosophila,25031180,10.1534/g3.114.012476,"When females mate to multiple males, the last male to mate fathers the majority of progeny. When males of different species inseminate a female, the sperm of the male conspecific to the female is favored in fertilization in a process known as conspecific sperm precedence (CSP). A large number of studies in Drosophila have assayed the genetic basis of sperm competition, with a main focus on D. melanogaster and accessory gland protein genes. Only a few studies have attempted to disentangle the genetic basis of CSP between related species of Drosophila. Although there is no a priori reason to believe that genes influencing intraspecific sperm competitive ability might also mediate conspecific sperm precedence, no study has addressed the question. Here, we test a group of candidate CSP genes between D. simulans and D. mauritiana for their effect on sperm competition in D. melanogaster. The use of P-element insertion lines identified CG14891 gene disruption as the only one causing a significant decrease in second male paternity success relative to wild-type and ebony tester males. The gene disruption affected both sperm displacement and the sperm fertilizing ability. Out of five genes tested using RNA interference, only gene knockdown of CG6864(Mst89B) [corrected] significantly reduced the male's ability to father progeny when second to mate. Our results suggest that CG14891 and CG6468 might have been co-opted from an intraspecies gene function (i.e., sperm competition) into an interspecies avoidance phenotype (i.e., CSP). Alternatively, the dual role of these genes could be a consequence of their pleiotropic roles.",2014,"Alberto Civetta, Scott Finn, Alberto Civetta, Scott Finn"
Arrest is a regulator of fiber-specific alternative splicing in the indirect flight muscles of Drosophila,25246617,10.1083/jcb.201405058,"Drosophila melanogaster flight muscles are distinct from other skeletal muscles, such as jump muscles, and express several uniquely spliced muscle-associated transcripts. We sought to identify factors mediating splicing differences between the flight and jump muscle fiber types. We found that the ribonucleic acid-binding protein Arrest (Aret) is expressed in flight muscles: in founder cells, Aret accumulates in a novel intranuclear compartment that we termed the Bruno body, and after the onset of muscle differentiation, Aret disperses in the nucleus. Down-regulation of the aret gene led to ultrastructural changes and functional impairment of flight muscles, and transcripts of structural genes expressed in the flight muscles became spliced in a manner characteristic of jump muscles. Aret also potently promoted flight muscle splicing patterns when ectopically expressed in jump muscles or tissue culture cells. Genetically, aret is located downstream of exd (extradenticle), hth (homothorax), and salm (spalt major), transcription factors that control fiber identity.

Diversity and dynamics of the Drosophila transcriptome,24670639,10.1038/nature12962,"Animal transcriptomes are dynamic, with each cell type, tissue and organ system expressing an ensemble of transcript isoforms that give rise to substantial diversity. Here we have identified new genes, transcripts and proteins using poly(A)+ RNA sequencing from Drosophila melanogaster in cultured cell lines, dissected organ systems and under environmental perturbations. We found that a small set of mostly neural-specific genes has the potential to encode thousands of transcripts each through extensive alternative promoter usage and RNA splicing. The magnitudes of splicing changes are larger between tissues than between developmental stages, and most sex-specific splicing is gonad-specific. Gonads express hundreds of previously unknown coding and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), some of which are antisense to protein-coding genes and produce short regulatory RNAs. Furthermore, previously identified pervasive intergenic transcription occurs primarily within newly identified introns.

Disruption of the protein kinase N gene of drosophila melanogaster results in the recessive delorean allele (pkndln) with a negative impact on wing morphogenesis,24531729,10.1534/g3.114.010579,"We describe the delorean mutation of the Drosophila melanogaster protein kinase N gene (pkn(dln)) with defects in wing morphology. Flies homozygous for the recessive pkn(dln) allele have a composite wing phenotype that exhibits changes in relative position and shape of the wing blade as well as loss of specific vein and bristle structures. The pkn(dln) allele is the result of a P-element insertion in the first intron of the pkn locus, and the delorean wing phenotype is contingent upon the interaction of insertion-bearing alleles in trans. The presence of the insertion results in production of a novel transcript that initiates from within the 3' end of the P-element. The delorean-specific transcript is predicted to produce a wild-type PKN protein. The delorean phenotype is not the result of a reduction in pkn expression, as it could not be recreated using a variety of wing-specific drivers of pkn-RNAi expression. Rather, it is the presence of the delorean-specific transcript that correlates with the mutant phenotype. We consider the delorean wing phenotype to be due to a pairing-dependent, recessive mutation that behaves as a dosage-sensitive, gain of function. Our analysis of genetic interactions with basket and nemo reflects an involvement of pkn and Jun-terminal kinase signaling in common processes during wing differentiation and places PKN as a potential effector of Rho1's involvement in the Jun-terminal kinase pathway. The delorean phenotype, with its associated defects in wing morphology, provides evidence of a role for PKN in adult morphogenetic processes.",2014,"Georgette L Sass, Bruce D Ostrow, Georgette L Sass, Bruce D Ostrow"
Neural pathways for the detection and discrimination of conspecific song in D. melanogaster,24794294,10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.048,"Background:
      
    

    
      During courtship, male Drosophila melanogaster sing a multipart courtship song to female flies. This song is of particular interest because (1) it is species specific and varies widely within the genus, (2) it is a gating stimulus for females, who are sensitive detectors of conspecific song, and (3) it is the only sexual signal that is under both neural and genetic control. This song is perceived via mechanosensory neurons in the antennal Johnston's organ, which innervate the antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC) of the brain. However, AMMC outputs that are responsible for detection and discrimination of conspecific courtship song remain unknown.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Using a large-scale anatomical screen of AMMC interneurons, we identify seven projection neurons (aPNs) and five local interneurons (aLNs) that outline a complex architecture for the ascending mechanosensory pathway. Neuronal inactivation and hyperactivation during behavior reveal that only two classes of interneurons are necessary for song responses--the projection neuron aPN1 and GABAergic interneuron aLN(al). These neurons are necessary in both male and female flies. Physiological recordings in aPN1 reveal the integration of courtship song as a function of pulse rate and outline an intracellular transfer function that likely facilitates the response to conspecific song.

      Genetic modification, or transgenesis, is a powerful technique to investigate the molecular interactions between vector-borne pathogens and their arthropod hosts, as well as a potential novel approach for vector-borne disease control. Transgenesis requires the use of specific regulatory regions, or promoters, to drive expression of genes of interest in desired target tissues. In mosquitoes, the vast majority of described promoters are from Anopheles and Aedes mosquitoes.

      Culex tarsalis is one of the most important vectors of arboviruses (including West Nile virus) in North America, yet it has not been the subject of molecular genetic study. In order to facilitate molecular genetic work in this important vector species, we isolated four fat body-specific promoter sequences located upstream of the Cx. tarsalis vitellogenin genes (Vg1a, Vg1b, Vg2a and Vg2b). Sequences were analyzed in silico to identify requisite cis-acting elements. The ability for promoter sequences to drive expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in vivo was investigated using transgenic Drosophila melanogaster. All four promoters were able to drive GFP expression but there was dramatic variation between promoters and between individual Drosophila lines, indicating significant position effects. The highest expression was observed in line Vg2bL3, which was >300-fold higher than the lowest line Vg1aL2.

Saccadic body turns in walking Drosophila,25386124,10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00365,"Drosophila melanogaster structures its optic flow during flight by interspersing translational movements with abrupt body rotations. Whether these ""body saccades"" are accompanied by steering movements of the head is a matter of debate. By tracking single flies moving freely in an arena, we now discovered that walking Drosophila also perform saccades. Movement analysis revealed that the flies separate rotational from translational movements by quickly turning their bodies by 15 degrees within a tenth of a second. Although walking flies moved their heads by up to 20 degrees about their bodies, their heads moved with the bodies during saccadic turns. This saccadic strategy contrasts with the head saccades reported for e.g., blowflies and honeybees, presumably reflecting optical constraints: modeling revealed that head saccades as described for these latter insects would hardly affect the retinal input in Drosophila because of the lower acuity of its compound eye. The absence of head saccades in Drosophila was associated with the absence of haltere oscillations, which seem to guide head movements in other flies. In addition to adding new twists to Drosophila walking behavior, our analysis shows that Drosophila does not turn its head relative to its body when turning during walking.",2014,"Bart R H Geurten, Philipp JÃ¤hde, Kristina Corthals, Martin C GÃ¶pfert, Bart R H Geurten, Philipp JÃ¤hde, Kristina Corthals, Martin C GÃ¶pfert"
Drosophila life span and physiology are modulated by sexual perception and reward,24292624,10.1126/science.1243339,"Sensory perception can modulate aging and physiology across taxa.

High-throughput whole-genome RNA sequencing experiments revealed a set of molecular processes that were affected by the activity of the longevity circuit, thereby identifying new candidate cell-nonautonomous aging mechanisms.

Sexual dimorphism and natural variation within and among species in the Drosophila retinal mosaic,25424626,10.1186/s12862-014-0240-x,"Background:
      
    

    
      Insect compound eyes are composed of ommatidia, which contain photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to different wavelengths of light defined by the specific rhodopsin proteins that they express. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has several different ommatidium types that can be localised to specific retinal regions, such as the dorsal rim area (DRA), or distributed stochastically in a mosaic across the retina, like the 'pale' and 'yellow' types. Variation in these ommatidia patterns very likely has important implications for the vision of insects and could underlie behavioural and environmental adaptations. However, despite the detailed understanding of ommatidia specification in D. melanogaster, the extent to which the frequency and distribution of the different ommatidium types vary between sexes, strains and species of Drosophila is not known.

      We investigated the frequency and distribution of ommatidium types based on rhodopsin protein expression, and the expression levels of rhodopsin transcripts in the eyes of both sexes of different strains of D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. mauritiana. We found that while the number of DRA ommatidia was invariant, Rh3 expressing ommatidia were more frequent in the larger eyes of females compared to the males of all species analysed. The frequency and distribution of ommatidium types also differed between strains and species. The D. simulans strain ZOM4 has the highest frequency of Rh3 expressing ommatidia, which is associated with a non-stochastic patch of pale and odd-coupled ommatidia in the dorsal-posterior of their eyes.

      Our results show that there is striking variation in the frequency and distribution of ommatidium types between sexes, strains and species of Drosophila. This suggests that evolutionary changes in the underlying regulatory mechanisms can alter the distribution of ommatidium types to promote or restrict their expression in specific regions of the eye within and between species, and that this could cause differences in vision among these flies.",2014,"Maarten Hilbrant, Isabel Almudi, Daniel J Leite, Linta Kuncheria, Nico Posnien, Maria D S Nunes, Alistair P McGregor, Maarten Hilbrant, Isabel Almudi, Daniel J Leite, Linta Kuncheria, Nico Posnien, Maria D S Nunes, Alistair P McGregor"
The Drosophila blood-brain barrier: development and function of a glial endothelium,25452710,10.3389/fnins.2014.00365,"The efficacy of neuronal function requires a well-balanced extracellular ion homeostasis and a steady supply with nutrients and metabolites. Therefore, all organisms equipped with a complex nervous system developed a so-called blood-brain barrier, protecting it from an uncontrolled entry of solutes, metabolites or pathogens. In higher vertebrates, this diffusion barrier is established by polarized endothelial cells that form extensive tight junctions, whereas in lower vertebrates and invertebrates the blood-brain barrier is exclusively formed by glial cells. Here, we review the development and function of the glial blood-brain barrier of Drosophila melanogaster. In the Drosophila nervous system, at least seven morphologically distinct glial cell classes can be distinguished. Two of these glial classes form the blood-brain barrier. Perineurial glial cells participate in nutrient uptake and establish a first diffusion barrier. The subperineurial glial (SPG) cells form septate junctions, which block paracellular diffusion and thus seal the nervous system from the hemolymph. We summarize the molecular basis of septate junction formation and address the different transport systems expressed by the blood-brain barrier forming glial cells.",2014,"Stefanie Limmer, Astrid Weiler, Anne Volkenhoff, Felix Babatz, Christian KlÃ¤mbt, Stefanie Limmer, Astrid Weiler, Anne Volkenhoff, Felix Babatz, Christian KlÃ¤mbt"
"Antimicrobial, antioxidative, and insect repellent effects of Artemisia absinthium essential oil",25317772,10.1055/s-0034-1383182,"In this paper, the chemical composition and biological activity of the essential oil of Artemisia absinthium was studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of ethnopharmacological uses of this plant species in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and wounds, and as an insect repellent. The aerial part of the plant was hydrodistilled, and the chemical composition of the essential oil was analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Forty-seven compounds, corresponding to 94.65 % of the total oil, were identified, with the main constituents being sabinene (24.49 %), sabinyl acetate (13.64 %), and Î±-phellandrene (10.29 %). The oil yield was 0.23 % (v/w). The antimicrobial activity of the oil was investigated against ten bacterial isolates (from patients wounds and stools) and seven American Type Culture Collection strains using a microwell dilution assay. The minimal inhibitory/bactericidal concentration of the oil ranged from < 0.08 to 2.43 mg/mL and from 0.08 to 38.80 mg/mL, respectively. The antioxidant activity of the essential oil was evaluated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radical-scavenging methods and assessed as significant. Skin irritation potential and acute toxicity of the oil were also investigated. Results of the skin irritant reaction showed that none of the 30 volunteers developed a positive skin irritant reaction to undiluted A. absinthium essential oil. Acute oral exposure to the essential oil did not cause mortality in the treated mice, but it did cause neurological, muscle, and gastrointestinal problems. A subchronic toxicity test on Drosophila melanogaster showed that the essential oil of A. absinthium is toxic for developing insect larvae. Starting with the concentration of 0.38 % of essential oil in medium, significant mortality of larvae exposed to the oil was noted when compared to the control. Probit analysis revealed that the LC50 value of A. absinthium essential oil for D. melanogaster larvae after 15 days of exposure was 6.31 % (49 mg/mL).

Impact of nuclear Piwi elimination on chromatin state in Drosophila melanogaster ovaries,24782529,10.1093/nar/gku268,"The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA)-interacting Piwi protein is involved in transcriptional silencing of transposable elements in ovaries of Drosophila melanogaster. Here we characterized the genome-wide effect of nuclear Piwi elimination on the presence of the heterochromatic H3K9me3 mark and HP1a, as well as on the transcription-associated mark H3K4me2. Our results demonstrate that a significant increase in the H3K4me2 level upon nuclear Piwi loss is not accompanied by the alterations in H3K9me3 and HP1a levels for several germline-expressed transposons, suggesting that in this case Piwi prevents transcription by a mechanism distinct from H3K9 methylation. We found that the targets of Piwi-dependent chromatin repression are mainly related to the elements that display a higher level of H3K4me2 modification in the absence of silencing, i.e. most actively transcribed elements. We also show that Piwi-guided silencing does not significantly influence the chromatin state of dual-strand piRNA-producing clusters. In addition, host protein-coding gene expression is essentially not affected due to the nuclear Piwi elimination, but we noted an increase in small nuclear spliceosomal RNAs abundance and propose Piwi involvement in their post-transcriptional regulation.

The protective effects of Rhodiola crenulata extracts on Drosophila melanogaster gut immunity induced by bacteria and SDS toxicity,25146450,10.1002/ptr.5215,"The aim of this study was to observe the effect of the Rhodiola crenulata extracts on gut immunity of Drosophila melanogaster. Wild-type flies fed standard cornmeal-yeast medium were used as controls. Experimental groups were supplemented with 2.5% R. crenulata aqueous extracts in standard medium. Survival rate was determined by feeding pathogenic microorganisms and toxic compounds. The levels of reactive oxygen species and dead cells were detected by dihydroethidium and 7-amino-actinomycin D staining, respectively. The expression of antimicrobial peptides was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and morphological change of the intestine was imaged by an Axioskop 2 plus microscope. The results demonstrate that R. crenulata increased the survival rates of adult flies and expression of antimicrobial peptide genes after pathogen or toxic compound ingestion. Moreover, decreased levels of reactive oxygen species and epithelial cell death were associated with results in improved intestinal morphology. The pharmacological action of R. crenulata from Tibet was greater than that from Sichuan. These results indicate that the R. crenulata extracts from Tibet had better pharmacological effect on D. melanogaster gut immunity after ingestion of pathogens and toxic compounds. These results may provide the pharmacological basis for prevention of inflammatory diseases of the intestine.",2014,"Caixia Zhu, Fachun Guan, Chao Wang, Li Hua Jin, Caixia Zhu, Fachun Guan, Chao Wang, Li Hua Jin"

Flies from groups II and III were incubated in a constant normobaric hypoxia (Po2=62-64 mm Hg) for 10 generations. A highly resistant group (Group IV) were exposed to a shortterm anoxia (Po,=1,5 mm Hg, 5 min) every generation. Larvae from Groups II, III, and IV demonstrated significantly elevated levels of Sir and CG 14740 expression. Larvae from Group II had a significantly higher expression of CG 14740 compared to group III.

Manganese-based superoxide dismutase mimics modify both acute and long-term outcome severity in a Drosophila melanogaster model of classic galactosemia,23758052,10.1089/ars.2012.5122,"Aims:
      
    

    
      The goal of this study was to use two manganese (Mn)-based superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimics to test the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species contribute to both acute and long-term outcomes in a galactose-1P uridylyltransferase (GALT)-null Drosophila melanogaster model of classic galactosemia.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We tested the impact of each of two Mn porphyrin SOD mimics, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP(5+), and MnTE-2-PyP(5+), (i) on survival of GALT-null Drosophila larvae reared in the presence versus absence of dietary galactose and (ii) on the severity of a long-term movement defect in GALT-null adult flies. Both SOD mimics conferred a significant survival benefit to GALT-null larvae exposed to galactose but not to controls or to GALT-null larvae reared in the absence of galactose. One mimic, MnTE-2-PyP(5+), also largely rescued a galactose-independent long-term movement defect otherwise seen in adult GALT-null flies. The survival benefit of both SOD mimics occurred despite continued accumulation of elevated galactose-1P in the treated animals, and studies of thiolated proteins demonstrated that in both the presence and absence of dietary galactose MnTE-2-PyP(5+) largely prevented the elevated protein oxidative damage otherwise seen in GALT-null animals relative to controls.

In this paper, we show that reduction of ER dysfunction ameliorates the functional and developmental defects of flies lacking the single Mfn mitochondrial assembly regulatory factor (Marf). Ubiquitous or neuron- and muscle-specific Marf ablation was lethal, altering mitochondrial and ER morphology and triggering ER stress that was conversely absent in flies lacking the fusion protein optic atrophy 1. Expression of Mfn2 and ER stress reduction in flies lacking Marf corrected ER shape, attenuating the developmental and motor defects.

Serotonin and downstream leucokinin neurons modulate larval turning behavior in Drosophila,24523545,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3500-13.2014,"Serotonin (5-HT) is known to modulate motor outputs in a variety of animal behaviors. However, the downstream neural pathways of 5-HT remain poorly understood. We studied the role of 5-HT in directional change, or turning, behavior of fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) larvae. We analyzed light- and touch-induced turning and found that turning is a combination of three components: bending, retreating, and rearing. Serotonin transmission suppresses rearing; when we inhibited 5-HT neurons with Shibire or Kir2.1, rearing increased without affecting the occurrence of bending or retreating. Increased rearing in the absence of 5-HT transmission often results in slower or failed turning, indicating that suppression of rearing by 5-HT is critical for successful turning. We identified a class of abdominal neurons called the abdominal LK neurons (ABLKs), which express the 5-HT1B receptor and the neuropeptide leucokinin, as downstream targets of 5-HT that are involved in the control of turning. Increased rearing was observed when neural transmission or leucokinin synthesis was inhibited in these cells. Forced activation of ABLKs also increased rearing, suggesting that an appropriate level of ABLK activity is critical for the control of turning. Calcium imaging revealed that ABLKs show periodic activation with an interval of ??5 s. The activity level of ABLKs increased and decreased in response to a 5-HT agonist and antagonist, respectively. Our results suggest that 5-HT modulates larval turning by regulating the activity level of downstream ABLK neurons and secretion of the neuropeptide leucokinin.",2014,"Satoko Okusawa, Hiroshi Kohsaka, Akinao Nose, Satoko Okusawa, Hiroshi Kohsaka, Akinao Nose"
Neural mechanisms of context-dependent processing of CO2 avoidance behavior in fruit flies,25483251,10.4161/fly.28000,"The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, innately avoids even low levels of CO2. CO2 is part of the so-called Drosophila stress odor produced by stressed flies, but also a byproduct of fermenting fruit, a main food source, making the strong avoidance behavior somewhat surprising. Therefore, we addressed whether feeding states might influence the fly's behavior and processing of CO2. In a recent report, we showed that this innate behavior is differentially processed and modified according to the feeding state of the fly. Interestingly, we found that hungry flies require the function of the mushroom body, a higher brain center required for olfactory learning and memory, but thought to be dispensable for innate olfactory behaviors. In addition, we anatomically and functionally characterized a novel bilateral projection neuron connecting the CO2 sensory input to the mushroom body. This neuron was essential for processing of CO2 in the starved fly but not in the fed fly. In this Extra View article, we provide evidence for the potential involvement of the neuromodulator dopamine in state-dependent CO2 avoidance behavior. Taken together, our work demonstrates that CO2 avoidance behavior is mediated by alternative neural pathways in a context-dependent manner. Furthermore, it shows that the mushroom body is not only involved in processing of learned olfactory behavior, as previously suggested, but also in context-dependent innate olfaction.",2014,"K P Siju, Lasse B BrÃ¤cker, I C Grunwald Kadow, K P Siju, Lasse B BrÃ¤cker, I C Grunwald Kadow"
Synaptic abnormalities in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease,24487408,10.1242/dmm.012104,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss and decreased synaptic function.

Here we describe synaptic defects in the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in this model. Our results indicate that expression of human APP and BACE at the larval NMJ leads to defective larval locomotion behavior, decreased presynaptic connections, altered mitochondrial localization in presynaptic motor neurons and decreased postsynaptic protein levels. Treating larvae expressing APP and BACE with the Î³-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 suppresses the behavioral defects as well as the pre- and postsynaptic defects.

Systems genomics of metabolic phenotypes in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster,24671769,10.1534/genetics.114.163857,"Systems biology is an approach to dissection of complex traits that explicitly recognizes the impact of genetic, physiological, and environmental interactions in the generation of phenotypic variation. We describe comprehensive transcriptional and metabolic profiling in Drosophila melanogaster across four diets, finding little overlap in modular architecture. Genotype and genotype-by-diet interactions are a major component of transcriptional variation (24 and 5.3% of the total variation, respectively) while there were no main effects of diet (<1%). Genotype was also a major contributor to metabolomic variation (16%), but in contrast to the transcriptome, diet had a large effect (9%) and the interaction effect was minor (2%) for the metabolome. Yet specific principal components of these molecular phenotypes measured in larvae are strongly correlated with particular metabolic syndrome-like phenotypes such as pupal weight, larval sugar content and triglyceride content, development time, and cardiac arrhythmia in adults. The second principal component of the metabolomic profile is especially informative across these traits with glycine identified as a key loading variable. To further relate this physiological variability to genotypic polymorphism, we performed evolve-and-resequence experiments, finding rapid and replicated changes in gene frequency across hundreds of loci that are specific to each diet. Adaptation to diet is thus highly polygenic. However, loci differentially transcribed across diet or previously identified by RNAi knockdown or expression QTL analysis were not the loci responding to dietary selection. Therefore, loci that respond to the selective pressures of diet cannot be readily predicted a priori from functional analyses.",2014,"Laura K Reed, Kevin Lee, Zhi Zhang, Lubna Rashid, Amy Poe, Benjamin Hsieh, Nigel Deighton, Norm Glassbrook, Rolf Bodmer, Greg Gibson, Laura K Reed, Kevin Lee, Zhi Zhang, Lubna Rashid, Amy Poe, Benjamin Hsieh, Nigel Deighton, Norm Glassbrook, Rolf Bodmer, Greg Gibson"
Trade-off of ovarian lipids and total body lipids for fecundity and starvation resistance in tropical populations of Drosophila melanogaster,25223796,10.1111/jeb.12480,"In Drosophila melanogaster, clines of starvation resistance along a latitudinal gradient (south to north) have been reported in India, which matched with their cline for total body lipids (TL ). Nevertheless, producing too many reserves is likely to be costly and a trade-off might exist with life-history traits. Previous studies on starvation resistance and life-history traits of D. melanogaster have mainly focused on quantification of total body lipids, instead of separating ovarian lipids from total body lipids. In the present study, we have quantified absolute ovarian lipids (OL ) versus absolute body lipids excluding ovarian lipids (BL ) and examined associations with fecundity as well as starvation resistance in two latitudinal populations (8.34 vs. 32.43Â°N) of D. melanogaster. Firstly, we observed a trade-off between BL and OL that matched the trade-off of starvation resistance, longevity versus fecundity and development time in latitudinal populations of D. melanogaster. Southern populations had higher starvation resistance, more BL and lesser OL, whereas northern populations had enhanced fecundity, OL and lesser BL . Secondly, within population, starvation resistance also correlated with BL , and fecundity with OL . However, there was no correlation between starvation resistance and OL . Moreover, there was utilization of BL and nonutilization of OL under starvation stress. Therefore, resources invested for fecundity in the form of OL were independent of evolved starvation resistance in D. melanogaster. Our results suggest that a common pool of energy storage compounds (lipids) are allocated differentially between fecundity and starvation resistance and are consistent with Y-model of resource allocation.",2014,"B Kalra, R Parkash"

Three of these residues were in extra-cellular loops of modeled RF-NH2 receptors and four in transmembrane helices oriented into a ligand binding pocket to allow contact with a peptide. The eighth residue was unavailable for interaction; yet its conservation suggested it played another role. A novel hydrophobic region representative of RF-NH2 receptors was also discovered. The presence of rhodopsin-like family A GPCR structural motifs including a toggle switch indicated RF-NH2s signal classically; however, some features of the DMS receptors were distinct from other RF-NH2 GPCRs.

FMAj: a tool for high content analysis of muscle dynamics in Drosophila metamorphosis,25521203,10.1186/1471-2105-15-S16-S6,"Background:
      
    

    
      During metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster, larval muscles undergo two different developmental fates; one population is removed by cell death, while the other persistent subset undergoes morphological remodeling and survives to adulthood. Thanks to the ability to perform live imaging of muscle development in transparent pupae and the power of genetics, metamorphosis in Drosophila can be used as a model to study the regulation of skeletal muscle mass. However, time-lapse microscopy generates sizeable image data that require new tools for high throughput image analysis.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We performed targeted gene perturbation in muscles and acquired 3D time-series images of muscles in metamorphosis using laser scanning confocal microscopy. To quantify the phenotypic effects of gene perturbations, we designed the Fly Muscle Analysis tool (FMAj) which is based on the ImageJ and MySQL frameworks for image processing and data storage, respectively. The image analysis pipeline of FMAj contains three modules. The first module assists in adding annotations to time-lapse datasets, such as genotypes, experimental parameters and temporal reference points, which are used to compare different datasets. The second module performs segmentation and feature extraction of muscle cells and nuclei. Users can provide annotations to the detected objects, such as muscle identities and anatomical information. The third module performs comparative quantitative analysis of muscle phenotypes. We applied our tool to the phenotypic characterization of two atrophy related genes that were silenced by RNA interference. Reduction of Drosophila Tor (Target of Rapamycin) expression resulted in enhanced atrophy compared to control, while inhibition of the autophagy factor Atg9 caused suppression of atrophy and enlarged muscle fibers of abnormal morphology. FMAj enabled us to monitor the progression of atrophic and hypertrophic phenotypes of individual muscles throughout metamorphosis.

The Drosophila surface glia transcriptome: evolutionary conserved blood-brain barrier processes,25426014,10.3389/fnins.2014.00346,"Central nervous system (CNS) function is dependent on the stringent regulation of metabolites, drugs, cells, and pathogens exposed to the CNS space. Cellular blood-brain barrier (BBB) structures are highly specific checkpoints governing entry and exit of all small molecules to and from the brain interstitial space, but the precise mechanisms that regulate the BBB are not well understood. In addition, the BBB has long been a challenging obstacle to the pharmacologic treatment of CNS diseases; thus model systems that can parse the functions of the BBB are highly desirable. In this study, we sought to define the transcriptome of the adult Drosophila melanogaster BBB by isolating the BBB surface glia with fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and profiling their gene expression with microarrays. By comparing the transcriptome of these surface glia to that of all brain glia, brain neurons, and whole brains, we present a catalog of transcripts that are selectively enriched at the Drosophila BBB. We found that the fly surface glia show high expression of many ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and solute carrier (SLC) transporters, cell adhesion molecules, metabolic enzymes, signaling molecules, and components of xenobiotic metabolism pathways. Using gene sequence-based alignments, we compare the Drosophila and Murine BBB transcriptomes and discover many shared chemoprotective and small molecule control pathways, thus affirming the relevance of invertebrate models for studying evolutionary conserved BBB properties.

Using Drosophila melanogaster to identify chemotherapy toxicity genes,25236447,10.1534/genetics.114.161968,"The severity of the toxic side effects of chemotherapy shows a great deal of interindividual variability, and much of this variation is likely genetically based. Simple DNA tests predictive of toxic side effects could revolutionize the way chemotherapy is carried out. Due to the challenges in identifying polymorphisms that affect toxicity in humans, we use Drosophila fecundity following oral exposure to carboplatin, gemcitabine and mitomycin C as a model system to identify naturally occurring DNA variants predictive of toxicity. We use the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR), a panel of recombinant inbred lines derived from a multiparent advanced intercross, to map quantitative trait loci affecting chemotoxicity. We identify two QTL each for carboplatin and gemcitabine toxicity and none for mitomycin. One QTL is associated with fly orthologs of a priori human carboplatin candidate genes ABCC2 and MSH2, and a second QTL is associated with fly orthologs of human gemcitabine candidate genes RRM2 and RRM2B. The third, a carboplatin QTL, is associated with a posteriori human orthologs from solute carrier family 7A, INPP4A&B, and NALCN. The fourth, a gemcitabine QTL that also affects methotrexate toxicity, is associated with human ortholog GPx4. Mapped QTL each explain a significant fraction of variation in toxicity, yet individual SNPs and transposable elements in the candidate gene regions fail to singly explain QTL peaks. Furthermore, estimates of founder haplotype effects are consistent with genes harboring several segregating functional alleles. We find little evidence for nonsynonymous SNPs explaining mapped QTL; thus it seems likely that standing variation in toxicity is due to regulatory alleles.",2014,"Elizabeth G King, Galina Kislukhin, Kelli N Walters, Anthony D Long, Elizabeth G King, Galina Kislukhin, Kelli N Walters, Anthony D Long"
Transgenerational interactions involving parental age and immune status affect female reproductive success in Drosophila melanogaster,25253454,10.1098/rspb.2014.1242,"It is well established that the parental phenotype can influence offspring phenotypic expression, independent of the effects of the offspring's own genotype.

We tested for such interactions, subjecting male and female Drosophila melanogaster of two different age classes to an immune activation challenge or a control treatment. Flies were then crossed in all age and immune status combinations, and the reproductive success of their immune- and control-treated daughters measured. We found that daughters produced by two younger parents exhibited reduced reproductive success relative to those of other parental age combinations. Furthermore, immune-challenged daughters exhibited higher reproductive success when produced by immune-challenged relative to control-treated mothers, a pattern consistent with transgenerational immune priming. Finally, a complex interplay between paternal age and parental immune statuses influenced daughter's reproductive success. These findings demonstrate the dynamic nature of age- and immune-mediated parental effects, traceable to both parents, and regulated by interactions between parents and between parents and offspring.",2014,"M Nystrand, D K Dowling, M Nystrand, D K Dowling"
EGFR signaling promotes self-renewal through the establishment of cell polarity in Drosophila follicle stem cells,25437306,10.7554/eLife.04437,"Epithelial stem cells divide asymmetrically, such that one daughter replenishes the stem cell pool and the other differentiates. We found that, in the epithelial follicle stem cell (FSC) lineage of the Drosophila ovary, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling functions specifically in the FSCs to promote the unique partially polarized state of the FSC, establish apical-basal polarity throughout the lineage, and promote FSC maintenance in the niche. In addition, we identified a novel connection between EGFR signaling and the cell-polarity regulator liver kinase B1 (LKB1), which indicates that EGFR signals through both the Ras-Raf-MEK-Erk pathway and through the LKB1-AMPK pathway to suppress apical identity. The development of apical-basal polarity is the earliest visible difference between FSCs and their daughters, and our findings demonstrate that the EGFR-mediated regulation of apical-basal polarity is essential for the segregation of stem cell and daughter cell fates.",2014,"Angela Castanieto, Michael J Johnston, Todd G Nystul, Angela Castanieto, Michael J Johnston, Todd G Nystul"
Exploring developmental and physiological functions of fatty acid and lipid variants through worm and fly genetics,25195508,10.1146/annurev-genet-041814-095928,"Lipids are more than biomolecules for energy storage and membrane structure. With ample structural variation, lipids critically participate in nearly all aspects of cellular function. Lipid homeostasis and metabolism are closely related to major human diseases and health problems. However, lipid functional studies have been significantly underdeveloped, partly because of the difficulty in applying genetics and common molecular approaches to tackle the complexity associated with lipid biosynthesis, metabolism, and function. In the past decade, a number of laboratories began to analyze the roles of lipid metabolism in development and other physiological functions using animal models and combining genetics, genomics, and biochemical approaches. These pioneering efforts have not only provided valuable insights regarding lipid functions in vivo but have also established feasible methodology for future studies. Here, we review a subset of these studies using Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster.",2014,"Huanhu Zhu, Min Han, Huanhu Zhu, Min Han"
Drosophila ARSs contain the yeast ARS consensus sequence and a replication enhancer,3092187,10.1093/nar/14.16.6633,"A number of restriction fragments that function as autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs) in yeast have been isolated from Drosophila melanogaster DNA. The behaviour in yeast of plasmids containing Drosophila ARS elements was studied and compared to that exhibited by the archetypal yeast ARS-1 plasmid. ARS functions were localised by subcloning and BAL-31 deletion analysis. These studies demonstrated the structural and functional complexity of Drosophila ARSs. Each Drosophila ARS element has at least two domains, one essential for replication (the replication sequence, RS) and a second (the replication enhancer, RE) which is essential for maximum function of the RS. The RS of three Drosophila ARSs was shown to contain a sequence identical to an 11 bp yeast ARS consensus sequence (5' A/T TTTATPuTTT A/T 3'). These observations lend support to the hypothesis that heterologous ARS elements may be of biological significance.",1986,"J S Mills, A J Kingsman, S M Kingsman, J S Mills, A J Kingsman, S M Kingsman"
The determination of aldehyde oxidase activity patterns in the wing discs of Drosophila melanogaster : Absence of field size influence during the third larval instar,28306059,10.1007/BF00376067,"The pattern of aldehyde oxidase (AO) activity was determined in wing discs of Drosophila melanogaster larvae homozygous for the mutants apt 73n, Beaded, and vestigial (vg) in order to determine if reduction in field size in the pouch could be related to alterations of the wild-type AO pattern, as suggested by the Kauffman (1978) hypothesis. The pattern in wild-type discs was resolved into six areas for comparison with mutant discs. vg discs developed at 25Â° C showed restriction of the pattern into a small area on the anterior side of the disc, and comparison of vg and wild-type prepupal wings allowed positive identification of the AO pattern elements which remained. AO patterns in vg wing discs grown at 27Â°, 29Â°, and 31Â° C were progressively more complete and similar to wild-type, reflecting the reduction in cell death in discs grown at higher temperatures. These results show that cell loss during the third instar in vg development at 25Â° C is responsible for the alteration of the AO pattern, rather than field size reduction, and that determination of the pattern must take place much earlier than the time of its first appearance during the third larval instar, and before cell death in vg discs begins. Thus mutants acting at earlier stages will be necessary for further tests of the Kauffman hypothesis.",1986,"Edward McCrady, Th E Sprey, Edward McCrady, Th E Sprey"
The 5'-flanking sequences of Drosophila melanogaster tRNA5Asn genes differentially arrest RNA polymerase III,3095322,,"Three tRNA5Asn genes have been subcloned from a tRNA gene cluster isolated from the cytogenetic locus 42A of Drosophila melanogaster. The three tRNAAsn genes, contained on plasmids pAsn6, pAsn7, and pAsn8, have identical mature tRNA coding regions but have different 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences. In vitro transcription in Drosophila Schneider S3 cell-free extracts showed the tRNAAsn genes had different transcription efficiencies. pAsn8 had a transcription efficiency of approximately 8 transcripts/gene/h, whereas pAsn6 was a less active template at 5 transcripts/gene/h. pAsn7 was the poorest template at 1.5 transcripts/gene/h. Exchanging 5'-flanking regions of the tRNAAsn genes showed that the differences in transcription efficiencies were attributable to the corresponding 5'-flanking region. Transcription of each of the tRNAAsn genes revealed a different optimum for KC1 concentration for each template which also was directly attributable to the corresponding 5'-flanking region. The ""salt effect"" is not related to the ability of the three tRNAAsn genes to sequester transcription factors as determined using the stable complex competition assay. Rather, this effect appears to be due to the ability of the respective 5'-flanking regions to interact with RNA polymerase III. The poorest transcription template, pAsn7, was a better competitor in the stable complex formation assay than either pAsn8 or pAsn6. We conclude that the pAsn7 stable complex binds and functionally arrests RNA polymerase III in the initiation reaction.",1986,"A Lofquist, S Sharp, A Lofquist, S Sharp"
The termini of extrachromosomal linear copia elements,2423971,10.1093/nar/14.9.3659,Extrachromosomal linear copia elements were isolated and cloned from cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells. Four full length copia recombinants were characterised. Each contains a full sized copy of copia bounded by its direct repeats. The sequences of the ends of the copia inserts were determined. All of the termini are identical to those of genomic copias except for a single base deletion from one end of one clone. These results suggest that the priming for initiation of copia reverse transcription differs from normal retroviral models. Southern blot analysis of uncloned full length copia circles shows that approximately 50% correspond to the predicted circularisation product of such linears. We propose that this class of circles and the linear DNAs described here are precursors to integrated genomic copia elements.,1986,"A J Flavell, C Brierley, A J Flavell, C Brierley"

[The effect of directed and stabilizing selection on the population size of Drosophila melanogaster],2511072,,Population size as a measure of population fitness was assayed in laboratory lines of Drosophila melanogaster subjected to directional selection for positive photoactivity and stabilizing selection for a complex of metric wing characters. Three experimental designs were used: directional and stabilizing selection (DS); directional selection (D); unselected controls (C). Population size increased under all three experimental designs. The population size of DS and C lines as well as the rate of increase of the DS lines were higher as compared to the D lines.

The banding pattern was found to be strikingly similiar in the two tissues. The puffing pattern of the PNC chromosomes is discussed.

The role of specific enhancer-promoter interactions in the Drosophila Adh promoter switch,2516829,10.1101/gad.3.12b.2191,"The Drosophila melanogaster alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene is transcribed from two promoters active at different developmental stages. In this paper we show that the promoters are differentially stimulated by two enhancers, the Adh larval enhancer and the Adh adult enhancer. In early larval stages, the larval enhancer stimulates transcription from the proximal promoter; in late larval stages, the two enhancers act synergistically to stimulate transcription from the distal promoter; and in adults, the adult enhancer stimulates transcription from the distal promoter. To determine the basis for these enhancer-promoter interactions, we examined the effect of each enhancer on three different promoters. We found that the adult enhancer is stage specific and stimulates transcription from all three promoters. In contrast, the larval enhancer is potentially active in all stages and stimulates transcription from only two of the three promoters. These observations suggest that normal temporal expression of Adh depends on the stage-specific activity of the adult enhancer and the differential response of the proximal and distal promoters to the larval enhancer.",1989,"V Corbin, T Maniatis, V Corbin, T Maniatis"

However, the major fractions of all subgroup members could be grouped into five SDS-PAGE domains according to the homologies of their electrophoretic mobilities, prominence of Coomassie blue staining, and PAS reaction. In all subgroup members, major fractions are involved in posttranslational modifications into larger protein molecules of the final glue. Quantitative estimations of the glue proteins in D. n. nasuta and D. n. albomicans reveal that they constitute between 55 and 60% of the total salivary gland proteins, whereas in D. melanogaster and in D. hydei the fraction is only 32 and 35%, respectively.",1989,"S R Ramesh, W E Kalisch, S R Ramesh, W E Kalisch"

rough deal: a gene required for proper mitotic segregation in Drosophila,2512302,10.1083/jcb.109.6.2951,"We describe a genetic locus rough deal (rod) in Drosophila melanogaster, identified by mutations that interfere with the faithful transmission of chromosomes to daughter cells during mitosis. Five mutant alleles were isolated, each associated with a similar set of mitotic abnormalities in the dividing neuroblasts of homozygous mutant larvae: high frequencies of aneuploid cells and abnormal anaphase figures, in which chromatids may lag, form bridges, or completely fail to separate. Surviving homozygous adults are sterile, and show cuticular defects associated with cell death, i.e., roughened eyes, sparse abdominal bristles, and notched wing margins. The morphological process of spermatogenesis is largely unaffected and motile sperm are produced, but meiocyte aneuploidy is common. The nature of the observed abnormalities in mitotic cells suggests that the reduced fidelity of chromosome transmission to the daughter cells is due to a failure in a mechanism involved in assuring the proper release of sister chromatids.",1989,"R E Karess, D M Glover, R E Karess, D M Glover"
Amino acid polymorphisms for esterase-6 in Drosophila melanogaster,2493155,10.1073/pnas.86.4.1426,"High-resolution electrophoresis has revealed 10 allozymes of esterase-6 (EC 3.1.1.1) in Drosophila melanogaster.

Sixteen of these cause amino acid replacements, of which three result in charge differences whose size and direction are consistent with the electrophoretic mobilities of the allozymes in which they occur. The smeared electrophoretic phenotype of one allozyme can be explained by the loss of a cysteine residue involved in a disulfide bridge. Several minor mobility variants within the major F and S electrophoretic phenotypes differ by amino acid substitutions that are generally conservative for charge but not for some other properties (size, polarity, or hydrophobicity). Four amino acid differences are found among different isolates of the same allozymes and, overall, 12 amino acid haplotypes occur among the 13 isolates sequenced.

Co-localization to chromosome bands 99E1-3 of the Drosophila melanogaster myosin light chain-2 gene and a haplo-insufficient locus that affects flight behavior,2471669,,"Using overlapping synthetic deficiencies, we find that a haplo-insufficient locus affecting flight behavior and the myosin light chain-2 gene co-map to the Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosome interval 99D9-E1 to 99E2-3. From screening over 9000 EMS-treated chromosomes, we obtained alleles of two complementation groups that map to this same interval. One of these complementation groups lfm(3)99Eb, exhibits dominant flightless behavior; thus, flightless behavior of the deficiency is in all likelihood due to hemizygosity of this single locus. Rescue of flightless behavior by a duplication indicates that the single allele, E38, of the Ifm(3)99Eb complementation group is a hypomorph. Based upon its map position and a reduction in concentration of myosin light chain-2 mRNA in heterozygotes, we propose that Ifm(3)Eb(E38) is a mutant allele of the myosin light chain-2 gene. Our genetic analysis also resulted in the identification of four dominant flightless alleles of an unlinked locus, l(3)nc99Eb, that exhibits dominant lethal synergism with Ifm(3)99Eb.",1989,"J W Warmke, A J Kreuz, S Falkenthal, J W Warmke, A J Kreuz, S Falkenthal"

Truncation also occurred in or near the 3' LTR. The 5' LTR polyadenylation signal was strongly potentiated by a downstream 326-bp internal gypsy segment in either orientation. Anti-parallel gypsy reduced the amount of normal transcript to a much smaller extent, and a low level of truncation occurred within gypsy. No evidence was found for effects of the gypsy insertions on the hsp82 promoter.

Hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila simulans lines transformed with autonomous P elements,2731724,,"The molecular and phenotypic analysis of several previously described P element-transformed lines of Drosophila simulans was extended in order to determine whether they had the potential to produce a syndrome of P-M hybrid dysgenesis analogous to the one in Drosophila melanogaster. The transformed line with the highest number of P elements at the beginning of the analysis, DsP pi-5C, developed strong P activity potential and P element regulation, properties characteristic of D. melanogaster P strains. The subsequent analysis of sublines derived from 34 single pair matings of DsP pi-5C revealed that they were heterogeneous with respect to both their P element complements and P activity potentials, but similar with respect to their regulatory capabilities. The subline with the highest P activity, DsP pi-5C-27, was subsequently used as a reference P strain in the genetic analysis of the D. simulans transformants. In these experiments, the reciprocal cross effect was observed with respect to both gonadal sterility and male recombination. As in D. melanogaster, the induction of gonadal sterility in D. simulans was shown to be temperature-dependent. Molecular analysis of DsP pi-5C-27 revealed that it has approximately 30 P elements per genome, at least some of which are defective. The number of potentially complete P elements in its genome is similar to the number in the D. melanogaster P strain, Harwich-77. Overall our analysis indicates that P-transformed lines of D. simulans are capable of expressing the major features of P-M hybrid dysgenesis previously demonstrated in D. melanogaster and that P elements appear to behave in a similar way in the two sibling species.",1989,"S B Daniels, A Chovnick, M G Kidwell, S B Daniels, A Chovnick, M G Kidwell"

Primer-extension and RNase protection assays show that the gene consists of eight exons and has a single transcription-start point. RNase protection mapping and comparison of the genomic sequence from three different cDNA clones reveal that three protein isoforms of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase are produced by alternative processing of 3' exons.

Interacting proteins identified by genetic interactions: a missense mutation in alpha-tubulin fails to complement alleles of the testis-specific beta-tubulin gene of Drosophila melanogaster,2498648,10.1128/mcb.9.3.875,"In this paper we demonstrate that failure to complement between mutations at separate loci can be used to identify genes that encode interacting structural proteins. A mutation (nc33) identified because it failed to complement mutant alleles of the gene encoding the testis-specific beta 2-tubulin of Drosophila melanogaster (B2t) did not map to the B2t locus. We show that this second-site noncomplementing mutation is a missense mutation in alpha-tubulin that results in substitution of methionine in place of valine at amino acid 177. Because alpha- and beta-tubulin form a heterodimer, our results suggest that the genetic interaction, failure to complement, is based on the structural interaction between the protein products of the two genes. Although the nc33 mutation failed to complement a null allele of B2t (B2tn), a deletion of the alpha-tubulin gene to which nc33 mapped complemented B2tn. Thus, the failure to complement appears to require the presence of the altered alpha-tubulin encoded by the nc33 allele, which may act as a structural poison when incorporated into either the tubulin heterodimer or microtubules.",1989,"T S Hays, R Deuring, B Robertson, M Prout, M T Fuller, T S Hays, R Deuring, B Robertson, M Prout, M T Fuller"
"The ash-1, ash-2 and trithorax genes of Drosophila melanogaster are functionally related",2497049,,"Mutations in the ash-1 and ash-2 genes of Drosophila melanogaster cause a wide variety of homeotic transformations that are similar to the transformations caused by mutations in the trithorax gene. Based on this similar variety of transformations, it was hypothesized that these genes are members of a functionally related set. Three genetic tests were employed here to evaluate that hypothesis. The first test was to examine interactions of ash-1, ash-2 and trithorax mutations with each other. Double and triple heterozygotes of recessive lethal alleles express characteristic homeotic transformations. For example, double heterozygotes of a null allele of ash-1 and a deletion of trithorax have partial transformations of their first and third legs to second legs and of their halteres to wings. The penetrance of these transformations is reduced by a duplication of the bithorax complex. The second test was to examine interactions with a mutation in the female sterile (1) homeotic gene. The penetrance of the homeotic phenotype in progeny from mutant mothers is increased by heterozygosis for alleles of ash-1 or ash-2 as well as for trithorax alleles. The third test was to examine the interaction with a mutation of the Polycomb gene. The extra sex combs phenotype caused by heterozygosis for a deletion of Polycomb is suppressed by heterozygosis for ash-1, ash-2 or trithorax alleles. The fact that mutations in each of the three genes gave rise to similar results in all three tests represents substantial evidence that ash-1, ash-2 and trithorax are members of a functionally related set of genes.",1989,"A Shearn, A Shearn"
A long interspersed repetitive element--the I factor of Drosophila teissieri--is able to transpose in different Drosophila species,2554335,10.1073/pnas.86.22.8887,"Long interspersed repetitive elements (LINEs) are transposable elements present in many species. In mammals they are difficult to study because most of them are defective and their transposition frequency is low. The I factor of Drosophila melanogaster is a LINE element that is particularly interesting because its transposition occurs at high frequency during I-R hybrid dysgenesis. This phenomenon occurs when males from the class of inducer strains are crossed with females from the class of reactive strains. Inducer strains contain several complete 5.4-kilobase I factors at various sites on the chromosomal arms. Reactive strains are devoid of complete I factors. Many results indicate that active I factors have invaded the D. melanogaster genome recently. To study the evolutionary history of I elements, we have cloned and sequenced a potentially active I factor from Drosophila teissieri. It is flanked by a target-site duplication and terminates at the 3' end by tandem repeats of the sequence TAA. When introduced into the germ line of a reactive strain of D. melanogaster by P element-mediated transformation, it is able to transpose and induces hybrid dysgenesis. This strengthens the hypothesis of a recent reinvasion of the D. melanogaster genome by active I factors giving rise to the inducer strains. They could have originated by horizontal transfer from another species. Such events also could occur for other LINE elements and might explain the spread of new variants in mammalian genomes. Moreover, the results give a further insight into I factor functional organization.",1989,"P Abad, C Vaury, A PÃ©lisson, M C Chaboissier, I Busseau, A Bucheton, P Abad, C Vaury, A PÃ©lisson, M C Chaboissier, I Busseau, A Bucheton"
Heritable variation in courtship patterns in Drosophila melanogaster,25650358,10.1534/g3.114.014811,"Little is known about the genetic basis of naturally occurring variation for sexually selected behavioral traits. Drosophila melanogaster, with its rich repertoire of courtship behavior and genomic and genetic resources, is an excellent model organism for addressing this question. We assayed a genetically diverse panel of lines with full genome sequences, the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, to assess the heritability of variation in courtship behavior and mating progression. We subsequently used these data to quantify natural variation in transition probabilities between courtship behaviors. We found heritable variation along the expected trajectory for courtship behaviors, including the tendency to initiate courtship and rate of progression through courtship, suggesting a genetic basis to male modulation of courtship behavior based on feedback from unrelated, outbred, and genetically identical females. We assessed the genetic basis of variation of the transition with the greatest heritability--from copulation to no engagement with the female--and identified variants in Serrate and Furin 1 as well as many other polymorphisms on the chromosome 3R associated with this transition. Our findings suggest that courtship is a highly dynamic behavior with both social and genetic inputs, and that males may play an important role in courtship initiation and duration.",2015,"Bryn E Gaertner, Elizabeth A Ruedi, Lenovia J McCoy, Jamie M Moore, Mariana F Wolfner, Trudy F C Mackay, Bryn E Gaertner, Elizabeth A Ruedi, Lenovia J McCoy, Jamie M Moore, Mariana F Wolfner, Trudy F C Mackay"
"The Drosophila genome nexus: a population genomic resource of 623 Drosophila melanogaster genomes, including 197 from a single ancestral range population",25631317,10.1534/genetics.115.174664,"Hundreds of wild-derived Drosophila melanogaster genomes have been published, but rigorous comparisons across data sets are precluded by differences in alignment methodology. The most common approach to reference-based genome assembly is a single round of alignment followed by quality filtering and variant detection. We evaluated variations and extensions of this approach and settled on an assembly strategy that utilizes two alignment programs and incorporates both substitutions and short indels to construct an updated reference for a second round of mapping prior to final variant detection. Utilizing this approach, we reassembled published D. melanogaster population genomic data sets and added unpublished genomes from several sub-Saharan populations. Most notably, we present aligned data from phase 3 of the Drosophila Population Genomics Project (DPGP3), which provides 197 genomes from a single ancestral range population of D. melanogaster (from Zambia). The large sample size, high genetic diversity, and potentially simpler demographic history of the DPGP3 sample will make this a highly valuable resource for fundamental population genetic research. The complete set of assemblies described here, termed the Drosophila Genome Nexus, presently comprises 623 consistently aligned genomes and is publicly available in multiple formats with supporting documentation and bioinformatic tools.

Identification of Light-Sensitive Phosphorylation Sites on PERIOD That Regulate the Pace of Circadian Rhythms in Drosophila,26711257,10.1128/MCB.00682-15,"The main components regulating the pace of circadian (??4 h) clocks in animals are PERIOD (PER) proteins, transcriptional regulators that undergo daily changes in levels and nuclear accumulation by means of complex multisite phosphorylation programs. In the present study, we investigated the function of two phosphorylation sites, at Ser826 and Ser828, located in a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) on the Drosophila melanogaster PER protein. These sites are phosphorylated by DOUBLETIME (DBT; Drosophila homolog of CK1Î´/Îµ), the key circadian kinase regulating the daily changes in PER stability and phosphorylation. Mutant flies in which phosphorylation at Ser826/Ser828 is blocked manifest behavioral rhythms with periods slightly longer than 1 h and with altered temperature compensation properties. Intriguingly, although phosphorylation at these sites does not influence PER stability, timing of nuclear entry, or transcriptional autoinhibition, the phospho-occupancy at Ser826/Ser828 is rapidly stimulated by light and blocked by TIMELESS (TIM), the major photosensitive clock component in Drosophila and a crucial binding partner of PER. Our findings identify the first phosphorylation sites on core clock proteins that are acutely regulated by photic cues and suggest that some phosphosites on PER proteins can modulate the pace of downstream behavioral rhythms without altering central aspects of the clock mechanism.",2015,"Evrim Yildirim, Joanna C Chiu, Isaac Edery, Evrim Yildirim, Joanna C Chiu, Isaac Edery"
Coordinated niche-associated signals promote germline homeostasis in the Drosophila ovary,26504174,10.1083/jcb.201503033,"Stem cell niches provide localized signaling molecules to promote stem cell fate and to suppress differentiation. The Drosophila melanogaster ovarian niche is established by several types of stromal cells, including terminal filament cells, cap cells, and escort cells (ECs). Here, we show that, in addition to its well-known function as a niche factor expressed in cap cells, the Drosophila transforming growth factor Î² molecule Decapentaplegic (Dpp) is expressed at a low level in ECs to maintain a pool of partially differentiated germline cells that may dedifferentiate to replenish germline stem cells upon their depletion under normal and stress conditions. Our study further reveals that the Dpp level in ECs is modulated by Hedgehog (Hh) ligands, which originate from both cap cells and ECs. We also demonstrate that Hh signaling exerts its function by suppressing Janus kinase/signal transducer activity, which promotes Dpp expression in ECs. Collectively, our data suggest a complex interplay of niche-associated signals that controls the development of a stem cell lineage.",2015,"Zhong Liu, Guohua Zhong, Phing Chian Chai, Lichao Luo, Sen Liu, Ying Yang, Gyeong-Hun Baeg, Yu Cai, Zhong Liu, Guohua Zhong, Phing Chian Chai, Lichao Luo, Sen Liu, Ying Yang, Gyeong-Hun Baeg, Yu Cai"
Positive Selection at the Polyhomeotic Locus Led to Decreased Thermosensitivity of Gene Expression in Temperate Drosophila melanogaster,25855066,10.1534/genetics.115.177030,"Drosophila melanogaster as a cosmopolitan species has successfully adapted to a wide range of different environments. Variation in temperature is one important environmental factor that influences the distribution of species in nature. In particular for insects, which are mostly ectotherms, ambient temperature plays a major role in their ability to colonize new habitats. Chromatin-based gene regulation is known to be sensitive to temperature. Ambient temperature leads to changes in the activation of genes regulated in this manner. One such regulatory system is the Polycomb group (PcG) whose target genes are more expressed at lower temperatures than at higher ones. Therefore, a greater range in ambient temperature in temperate environments may lead to greater variability (plasticity) in the expression of these genes. This might have detrimental effects, such that positive selection acts to lower the degree of the expression plasticity. We provide evidence for this process in a genomic region that harbors two PcG-regulated genes, polyhomeotic proximal (ph-p) and CG3835. We found a signature of positive selection in this gene region in European populations of D. melanogaster and investigated the region by means of reporter gene assays. The target of selection is located in the intergenic fragment between the two genes. It overlaps with the promoters of both genes and an experimentally validated Polycomb response element (PRE). This fragment harbors five sequence variants that are highly differentiated between European and African populations. The African alleles confer a temperature-induced plasticity in gene expression, which is typical for PcG-mediated gene regulation, whereas thermosensitivity is reduced for the European alleles.",2015,"Susanne Voigt, Stefan Laurent, Maria Litovchenko, Wolfgang Stephan, Susanne Voigt, Stefan Laurent, Maria Litovchenko, Wolfgang Stephan"

Choosing mates based on the diet of your ancestors: replication of non-genetic assortative mating in Drosophila melanogaster,26339551,10.7717/peerj.1173,"Assortative mating has been a focus of considerable research because of its potential to influence biodiversity at many scales. Sharon et al. (2010) discovered that an inbred strain of Drosophila melanogaster mated assortatively based on the diet of previous generations, leading to initial reproductive isolation without genetic evolution. This behavior was reproduced by manipulating the microbiome independently of the diet, pointing to extracellular bacterial symbionts as the assortative mating cue. To further investigate the biological significance of this result, we attempted to reproduce this phenomenon in an independent laboratory using different genotypes and additional mating assays. Supporting the previous result, we found that a different inbred strain also mated assortatively based on the diets of previous generations. However, we were unable to generate assortative mating in an outbred strain from North Carolina. Our results support the potential for non-genetic mechanisms to influence reproductive isolation, but additional work is needed to investigate the importance of this mechanism in natural populations of Drosophila.",2015,"Michael A Najarro, Matt Sumethasorn, Alexandra Lamoureux, Thomas L Turner, Michael A Najarro, Matt Sumethasorn, Alexandra Lamoureux, Thomas L Turner"

Larval duration, pupal duration, and the emergence of flies of both treated and control groups were recorded. Results obtained show a significant (p < 0.001-0.05) change in the mentioned parameters in the treated flies when compared with the controls. Interestingly, the percentage emergence of flies shows a decreasing trend along with increase in treatment concentration and almost no detectable emergence is observed in 200 ppm treatment category until the 20th day of experiment.

In four experimental settings, recombinant genomes became the sole or dominant genome in the progeny. Thus, selection uncovers occurrence of homologous recombination in Drosophila mtDNA and documents its functional benefit. Double-strand breaks enhanced recombination in the germline and revealed somatic recombination. When the recombination partner was a diverged Drosophila melanogaster genome or a genome from a different species such as Drosophila yakuba, sequencing revealed long continuous stretches of exchange.

Expression of calpain-like proteins and effects of calpain inhibitors on the growth rate of Angomonas deanei wild type and aposymbiotic strains,26415499,10.1186/s12866-015-0519-0,"Background:
      
    

    
      Angomonas deanei is a trypanosomatid parasite of insects that has a bacterial endosymbiont, which supplies amino acids and other nutrients to its host. Bacterium loss induced by antibiotic treatment of the protozoan leads to an aposymbiotic strain with increased need for amino acids and results in increased production of extracellular peptidases. In this work, a more detailed examination of A. deanei was conducted to determine the effects of endosymbiont loss on the host calpain-like proteins (CALPs), followed by testing of different calpain inhibitors on parasite proliferation.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Western blotting showed the presence of different protein bands reactive to antibodies against calpain from Drosophila melanogaster (anti-Dm-calpain), lobster calpain (anti-CDPIIb) and cytoskeleton-associated calpain from Trypanosoma brucei (anti-CAP5.5), suggesting a possible modulation of CALPs influenced by the endosymbiont. In the cell-free culture supernatant of A. deanei wild type and aposymbiotic strains, a protein of 80 kDa cross-reacted with the anti-Dm-calpain antibody; however, no cross-reactivity was found with anti-CAP5.5 and anti-CDPIIb antibodies. A search in A. deanei genome for homologues of D. melanogaster calpain, T. brucei CAP5.5 and lobster CDPIIb calpain revealed the presence of hits with at least one calpain conserved domain and also with theoretical molecular mass consistent with the recognition by each antibody. No significant hit was observed in the endosymbiont genome, indicating that calpain molecules might be absent from the symbiont. Flow cytometry analysis of cells treated with the anti-calpain antibodies showed that a larger amount of reactive epitopes was located intracellularly. The reversible calpain inhibitor MDL28170 displayed a much higher efficacy in diminishing the growth of both strains compared to the non-competitive calpain inhibitor PD150606, while the irreversible calpain inhibitor V only marginally diminished the proliferation.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Altogether, these results indicate that distinct calpain-like molecules are expressed by A. deanei, with a possible modulation in the expression influenced by the endosymbiont.

Although some changes in life extensity in males were identified (the effect of hormesis after the exposure to 5, 10 and 40 cGy) as well as in females (the effect of hormesis after the exposure to 5 and 40 cGy), they were not caused by the organism ""physiological"" changes. This means that the observed changes in life expectancy are not related to the changes of organism physiological functions after the exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation.

Dscam2 affects visual perception in Drosophila melanogaster,26106310,10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00149,"Dscam2, a cell surface protein that mediates cellular repulsion, plays a crucial role in the development of the Drosophila melanogaster visual system. Dscam2 generates boundaries between neighboring modules in the fly optic lobe; in Dscam2 mutants this visual system modularity is compromised. Although developmental wiring defects have been well described in the Dscam2 mutant, behavioral consequences have not been investigated. To address this, we examined the visual behavior of Dscam2 mutant flies. Using a phototaxis assay, we ascertained that these flies are not blind, but have a reduced phototaxic response. Through population-based and single fly optomotor assays, we found that Dscam2 mutant flies can track motion but that their response is opposite to control flies under defined experimental conditions. In a fixation paradigm, which allows tethered flies to control the angular position of a visual stimulus, mutant flies' responses were diametrically opposed to those seen in control flies. These data suggest that modest changes in the modularity of the fly visual system in the Dscam2 mutant can dramatically change the perception of specific visual cues and modify behavior.",2015,"Danny S Bosch, Bruno van Swinderen, S Sean Millard, Danny S Bosch, Bruno van Swinderen, S Sean Millard"

We obtained cell culture subclones with double Wolbachia infection and subclones infected only by strain wMel. Dual infection with the Wolbachia strains wMel and wRi has been stably maintained in the subclones for two years. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of the obtained subclones revealed the presence of dual infection for all five Wolbachia genes used for MLST Cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis of individual forms of the fbpA gene of Wolbachia from cell clones with dual infection showed intragenic recombination events between strains wMel and wRi, which occurred in the permanent D. melanogaster culture cell culture.

Low evolutionary potential for egg-to-adult viability in Drosophila melanogaster at high temperatures,25644054,10.1111/evo.12617,"To cope with the increasing and less-predictable temperature forecasts under climate change, many terrestrial ectotherms will have to migrate or rely on adaptation through plastic or evolutionary means.

Here we use replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster and a nested half-sib/full-sib quantitative genetic design to estimate heritabilities and genetic variance components for egg-to-adult viability under both laboratory and seminatural field conditions, encompassing cold, benign, and hot temperatures in two separate populations. The results demonstrated temperature-specific heritabilities and additive genetic variances for egg-to-adult viability. Heritabilities and genetic variances were higher under cold and benign compared to hot temperatures when tested under controlled laboratory conditions. Tendencies toward lower evolutionary potential at higher temperatures were also observed under seminatural conditions although the results were less clear in the field setting. Overall the results suggest that ectotherms that already experience temperatures close to their upper thermal tolerance limits have a restricted capacity to adapt to higher temperatures by evolutionary means.",2015,"Torsten N Kristensen, Johannes Overgaard, Jan Lassen, Ary A Hoffmann, Carla SgrÃ², Torsten N Kristensen, Johannes Overgaard, Jan Lassen, Ary A Hoffmann, Carla SgrÃ²"
Pseudo-acetylation of K326 and K328 of actin disrupts Drosophila melanogaster indirect flight muscle structure and performance,25972811,10.3389/fphys.2015.00116,"In striated muscle tropomyosin (Tm) extends along the length of F-actin-containing thin filaments. Its location governs access of myosin binding sites on actin and, hence, force production. Intermolecular electrostatic associations are believed to mediate critical interactions between the proteins. For example, actin residues K326, K328, and R147 were predicted to establish contacts with E181 of Tm. Moreover, K328 also potentially forms direct interactions with E286 of myosin when the motor is strongly bound. Recently, LC-MS/MS analysis of the cardiac acetyl-lysine proteome revealed K326 and K328 of actin were acetylated, a post-translational modification (PTM) that masks the residues' inherent positive charges. Here, we tested the hypothesis that by removing the vital actin charges at residues 326 and 328, the PTM would perturb Tm positioning and/or strong myosin binding as manifested by altered skeletal muscle function and structure in the Drosophila melanogaster model system. Transgenic flies were created that permit tissue-specific expression of K326Q, K328Q, or K326Q/K328Q acetyl-mimetic actin and of wild-type actin via the UAS-GAL4 bipartite expression system. Compared to wild-type actin, muscle-restricted expression of mutant actin had a dose-dependent effect on flight ability. Moreover, excessive K328Q and K326Q/K328Q actin overexpression induced indirect flight muscle degeneration, a phenotype consistent with hypercontraction observed in other Drosophila myofibrillar mutants. Based on F-actin-Tm and F-actin-Tm-myosin models and on our physiological data, we conclude that acetylating K326 and K328 of actin alters electrostatic associations with Tm and/or myosin and thereby augments contractile properties.

Strains of Aspergillus, Mucor, Penicillium, and Trichoderma were grown with wild-type larvae and the toxic effects of volatile products on the developmental stages of Drosophila larvae were evaluated. Furthermore, heterozygous mutants of Drosophila carrying the apoptotic genes, reaper and dronc, were used to assess the role of apoptosis in fungal VOCs mediated toxicity. Third-instar larvae of Drosophila carrying these apoptotic genes were exposed to fungal VOCs emitted from growing mold cultures for 10 days. The larval strains carrying apoptopic genes survived longer than the control wild type larvae; moreover, of those that survived, heterozygous reaper and dronc strains progressed to pupae and adult phases more rapidly, suggesting that fungal VOCs may induce apoptotic changes in flies.

Relative to the whole genome, genes functioning in amino acid metabolism are significantly over-represented among the pea aphid orthologues of Malpighian tubule genes, likely reflecting the central importance of amino acid acquisition and metabolism in aphids.

The interaction of GEFmeso with Rho family GTPases was studied by means of guanine nucleotide exchange assays. Our results suggest that GEFmeso interacts with Rac1 in addition to its interaction with CDC42 and Ral, which was reported earlier.

Olfactory neuromodulation of motion vision circuitry in Drosophila,25619767,10.1016/j.cub.2014.12.012,"It is well established that perception is largely multisensory; often served by modalities such as touch, vision, and hearing that detect stimuli emanating from a common point in space; and processed by brain tissue maps that are spatially aligned. However, the neural interactions among modalities that share no spatial stimulus domain yet are essential for robust perception within noisy environments remain uncharacterized. Drosophila melanogaster makes its living navigating food odor plumes. Odor acts to increase the strength of gaze-stabilizing optomotor reflexes to keep the animal aligned within an invisible plume, facilitating odor localization in free flight. Here, we investigate the cellular mechanism for cross-modal behavioral interactions. We characterize a wide-field motion-selective interneuron of the lobula plate that shares anatomical and physiological similarities with the ""Hx"" neuron identified in larger flies. Drosophila Hx exhibits cross-modal enhancement of visual responses by paired odor, and presynaptic inputs to the lobula plate are required for behavioral odor tracking but are not themselves the target of odor modulation, nor is the neighboring wide-field ""HSE"" neuron. Octopaminergic neurons mediating increased visual responses upon flight initiation also show odor-evoked calcium modulations and form connections with Hx dendrites. Finally, restoring synaptic vesicle trafficking within the octopaminergic neurons of animals carrying a null mutation for all aminergic signaling is sufficient to restore odor-tracking behavior.

We will use as an example the quantification of tubulin polyglycylation in wild-type testes and in Bug22 mutant testes, which present defects in the deposition of this posttranslational modification. During sperm biogenesis, flagella appear tightly bundled, which makes it more challenging to get accurate measurements of protein levels from immunostained specimens.

Characterization of a Drosophila ortholog of the Cdc7 kinase: a role for Cdc7 in endoreplication independent of Chiffon,25451925,10.1074/jbc.M114.597948,"Cdc7 is a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates components of the pre-replication complex during DNA replication initiation. Cdc7 is highly conserved, and Cdc7 orthologs have been characterized in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. Cdc7 is activated specifically during late G1/S phase by binding to its regulatory subunit, Dbf4. Drosophila melanogaster contains a Dbf4 ortholog, Chiffon, which is essential for chorion amplification in Drosophila egg chambers. However, no Drosophila ortholog of Cdc7 has yet been characterized. Here, we report the functional and biochemical characterization of a Drosophila ortholog of Cdc7. Co-expression of Drosophila Cdc7 and Chiffon is able to complement a growth defect in yeast containing a temperature-sensitive Cdc7 mutant. Cdc7 and Chiffon physically interact and can be co-purified from insect cells. Cdc7 phosphorylates the known Cdc7 substrates Mcm2 and histone H3 in vitro, and Cdc7 kinase activity is stimulated by Chiffon and inhibited by the Cdc7-specific inhibitor XL413. Drosophila egg chamber follicle cells deficient for Cdc7 have a defect in two types of DNA replication, endoreplication and chorion gene amplification. However, follicle cells deficient for Chiffon have a defect in chorion gene amplification but still undergo endocycling. Our results show that Cdc7 interacts with Chiffon to form a functional Dbf4-dependent kinase complex and that Cdc7 is necessary for DNA replication in Drosophila egg chamber follicle cells. Additionally, we show that Chiffon is a member of an expanding subset of DNA replication initiation factors that are not strictly required for endoreplication in Drosophila.",2015,"Robert Stephenson, Marcus R Hosler, Navnath S Gavande, Arun K Ghosh, Vikki M Weake, Robert Stephenson, Marcus R Hosler, Navnath S Gavande, Arun K Ghosh, Vikki M Weake"
Filopodial dynamics and growth cone stabilization in Drosophila visual circuit development,26512889,10.7554/eLife.10721,"Filopodial dynamics are thought to control growth cone guidance, but the types and roles of growth cone dynamics underlying neural circuit assembly in a living brain are largely unknown. To address this issue, we have developed long-term, continuous, fast and high-resolution imaging of growth cone dynamics from axon growth to synapse formation in cultured Drosophila brains. Using R7 photoreceptor neurons as a model we show that >90% of the growth cone filopodia exhibit fast, stochastic dynamics that persist despite ongoing stepwise layer formation. Correspondingly, R7 growth cones stabilize early and change their final position by passive dislocation. N-Cadherin controls both fast filopodial dynamics and growth cone stabilization. Surprisingly, loss of N-Cadherin causes no primary targeting defects, but destabilizes R7 growth cones to jump between correct and incorrect layers. Hence, growth cone dynamics can influence wiring specificity without a direct role in target recognition and implement simple rules during circuit assembly.",2015,"Mehmet Neset ?zel, Marion Langen, Bassem A Hassan, P Robin Hiesinger, Mehmet Neset ?zel, Marion Langen, Bassem A Hassan, P Robin Hiesinger"

MiRNA profiling provides insights on adverse effects of Cr(VI) in the midgut tissues of Drosophila melanogaster,25464296,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.09.054,"Cr(VI), a well-known environmental chemical, is reported to cause various adverse effects on exposed organisms including genomic instability and carcinogenesis. Despite available information on the underlying mechanism of Cr(VI) induced toxicity, studies regarding toxicity modulation by epigenetic mechanisms are limited. It was therefore, hypothesized that the global miRNA profiling in Cr(VI) exposed Drosophila, a genetically tractable model organism, will provide information about mis-regulated miRNAs along with their targeted genes and relevant processes. Third instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon R(+)) were exposed to 5.0-20.0 Î¼g/ml of Cr(VI) for 24 and 48 h. Following miRNA profile analysis on an Agilent platform, 28 of the 36 differentially expressed miRNAs were found to be significantly mis-regulated targeting major biological processes viz., DNA damage repair, oxidation-reduction processes, development and differentiation. Down-regulation of mus309 and mus312 under DNA repair, acon to oxidation-reduction and pyd to stress activated MAPK cascade respectively belonging to these gene ontology classes concurrent with up-regulation of dme-miR-314-3p, dme-miR-79-3p and dme-miR-12-5p confirm their functional involvement against Cr(VI) exposure.

The E3 ligase ube3a is required for learning in Drosophila melanogaster,25935478,10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.04.110,"Angelman syndrome and autism are neurodevelopmental disorders linked to mutations and duplications of an E3 ligase called ube3a respectively. Since cognitive deficits and learning disabilities are hallmark symptoms of both these disorders, we investigated a role for dube3a in the learning ability of flies using the aversive phototaxis suppression assay. We show that down and up-regulation of dube3a are both detrimental to learning in larvae and adults. Using conditional gene expression we found that dube3a is required for normal brain development and during adulthood. Furthermore, we suggest that dube3a could be interacting with other learning and memory genes such as derailed.

Extent of mismatch between the period of circadian clocks and light/dark cycles determines time-to-emergence in fruit flies,24668961,10.1111/1744-7917.12126,"Circadian clocks time developmental stages of fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster, while light/dark (LD) cycles delimit emergence of adults, conceding only during the ""allowed gate."" Previous studies have revealed that time-to-emergence can be altered by mutations in the core clock gene period (per), or by altering the length of LD cycles. Since this evidence came from studies on genetically manipulated flies, or on flies maintained under LD cycles with limited range of periods, inferences that can be drawn are limited. Moreover, the extent of shortening or lengthening of time-to-emergence remains yet unknown. In order to pursue this further, we assayed time-to-emergence of D. melanogaster under 12 different LD cycles as well as in constant light (LL) and constant dark conditions (DD). Time-to-emergence in flies occurred earlier under LL than in LD cycles and DD. Among the LD cycles, time-to-emergence occurred earlier under T4-T8, followed by T36-T48, and then T12-T32, suggesting that egg-to-emergence duration in flies becomes shorter when the length of LD cycles deviates from 24 h, bearing a strong positive and a marginally negative correlation with day length, for values shorter and longer than 24 h, respectively. These results suggest that the extent of mismatch between the period of circadian clocks and environmental cycles determines the time-to-emergence in Drosophila.",2015,"Pankaj Yadav, Deepak Choudhury, Madhumala K Sadanandappa, Vijay Kumar Sharma, Pankaj Yadav, Deepak Choudhury, Madhumala K Sadanandappa, Vijay Kumar Sharma"
Cryptochrome-dependent and -independent circadian entrainment circuits in Drosophila,25878285,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0070-15.2015,"Entrainment to environmental light/dark (LD) cycles is a central function of circadian clocks. In Drosophila, entrainment is achieved by Cryptochrome (CRY) and input from the visual system. During activation by brief light pulses, CRY triggers the degradation of TIMELESS and subsequent shift in circadian phase. This is less important for LD entrainment, leading to questions regarding light input circuits and mechanisms from the visual system. Recent studies show that different subsets of brain pacemaker clock neurons, the morning (M) and evening (E) oscillators, have distinct functions in light entrainment. However, the role of CRY in M and E oscillators for entrainment to LD cycles is unknown. Here, we address this question by selectively expressing CRY in different subsets of clock neurons in a cry-null (cry(0)) mutant background. We were able to rescue the light entrainment deficits of cry(0) mutants by expressing CRY in E oscillators but not in any other clock neurons. Par domain protein 1 molecular oscillations in the E, but not M, cells of cry(0) mutants still responded to the LD phase delay. This residual light response was stemming from the visual system because it disappeared when all external photoreceptors were ablated genetically. We concluded that the E oscillators are the targets of light input via CRY and the visual system and are required for normal light entrainment.",2015,"Taishi Yoshii, Christiane Hermann-Luibl, Christa Kistenpfennig, Benjamin Schmid, Kenji Tomioka, Charlotte Helfrich-FÃ¶rster, Taishi Yoshii, Christiane Hermann-Luibl, Christa Kistenpfennig, Benjamin Schmid, Kenji Tomioka, Charlotte Helfrich-FÃ¶rster"

I focus here on four critical challenges emerging from recent advances in our understanding of the genomic basis of human neurologic disorders where innovative experimental strategies are urgently needed: (1) pinpointing causal genes from associated genomic loci; (2) confirming the functional impact of allelic variants; (3) elucidating nervous system roles for novel or poorly studied genes; and (4) probing network interactions within implicated regulatory pathways. Drosophila genetic approaches are ideally suited to address each of these potential translational roadblocks, and will therefore contribute to mechanistic insights and potential breakthrough therapies for complex genetic disorders in the coming years.

In light of considerable limitations of previous studies proposing that the late chronotypes exhibit weakly stable rhythms, we employed outbred Drosophila populations exhibiting early and late emergence chronotypes to re-visit such associations. Contrary to previous reports, we observed that the late chronotypes consistently exhibit higher stability in emergence and activity-rest rhythms as compared to the early chronotypes, both under laboratory and semi-natural conditions, which is not associated with higher precision of circadian clocks, thus demonstrating the existence of genetic correlations between accuracy of entrainment and chronotype.

Proteomic analysis of individual fruit fly hemolymph,25596379,10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.11.027,"Analysis of blood proteins holds critical promise for in depth understanding of physiological states. Protein content of hemolymph from Drosophila melanogaster is of particular analytical interest because the insect open circulatory system involves chemical signaling through the hemolymph. The challenge of working with this sample, however, is the nanoliter volumes of solution available for analysis. In this study, we developed a novel hyphenated Agilent nano-HPLC chip column-MS method to obtain proteomic information from individual fruit fly hemolymph, using a low-volume sample collection technique established previously. The total amount of individual Drosophila hemolymph protein is determined around 0.798 Â± 0.251 Î¼g/100 nL based upon a Bradford assay with BSA. Hemolymph samples around 50 nL were collected from single flies and digested using a customized micro-scale digestion protocol. Mass spectral analysis shows a total of 19 proteins were identified from the hemolymph of individual flies. Of these findings, 6 novel proteins have been identified for the first time with evidence at the translation level. Detection of 13 proteins well-known in the literature speaks to the method's validity and demonstrates the ability to reproducibly analyze volume-limited samples from individual fruit flies for protein content.

The Unique Non-Catalytic C-Terminus of P37delta-PI3K Adds Proliferative Properties In Vitro and In Vivo,26024481,10.1371/journal.pone.0127497,"The PI3K/Akt pathway is central for numerous cellular functions and is frequently deregulated in human cancers. The catalytic subunits of PI3K, p110, are thought to have a potential oncogenic function, and the regulatory subunit p85 exerts tumor suppressor properties. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a highly suitable system to investigate PI3K signaling, expressing one catalytic, Dp110, and one regulatory subunit, Dp60, and both show strong homology with the human PI3K proteins p110 and p85. We recently showed that p37Î´, an alternatively spliced product of human PI3K p110Î´, displayed strong proliferation-promoting properties despite lacking the catalytic domain completely. Here we functionally evaluate the different domains of human p37Î´ in Drosophila. The N-terminal region of Dp110 alone promotes cell proliferation, and we show that the unique C-terminal region of human p37Î´ further enhances these proliferative properties, both when expressed in Drosophila, and in human HEK-293 cells. Surprisingly, although the N-terminal region of Dp110 and the C-terminal region of p37Î´ both display proliferative effects, over-expression of full length Dp110 or the N-terminal part of Dp110 decreases survival in Drosophila, whereas the unique C-terminal region of p37Î´ prevents this effect. Furthermore, we found that the N-terminal region of the catalytic subunit of PI3K p110, including only the Dp60 (p85)-binding domain and a minor part of the Ras binding domain, rescues phenotypes with severely impaired development caused by Dp60 over-expression in Drosophila, possibly by regulating the levels of Dp60, and also by increasing the levels of phosphorylated Akt.

The activity of copper-zinc-containing superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), manganese-containing superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and catalase (CAT), as well as the lipofuscin (LF) content were determined. The mRNA levels of SOD1, SOD2 and CAT were quantified by qPCR. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and paraquat were used to mimic the effects of damage caused by acute oxidative stress. D-galactose was used to mimic chronic pathological aging. CSOL significantly prolonged the lifespan of the fruit flies under physiological conditions. The activity of SOD1 and CAT was upregulated, and LF accumulation was inhibited by CSOL. CSOL had no effect on the transcriptional levels (mRNA) of these enzymes. The survival time of the fruit flies which were negatively affected by exposure to H2O2 or paraquat was significantly prolonged by CSOL. In fruit flies pathologically aged by epxosure to D-galactose, CSOL also significantly prolonged their lifespan, upregulated the activity of SOD1 and CAT, and inhibited LF accumulation. The findings of our study indicate that CSOL prolongs the lifespan of fruit flies through an anti-oxidative stress pathway involving the upregulation of SOD1 and CAT activity and the inhibition of LF accumulation.

Upon arl2 RNA intereference, Arl2-GDP expression, or arl2 deletions, microtubule abnormalities and asymmetric division defects were observed. Conversely, overactivation of Arl2 leads to microtubule overgrowth and depletion of NBs. Arl2 regulates microtubule growth and asymmetric division through localizing Msps to the centrosomes in NBs. Moreover, Arl2 regulates dynein function and in turn centrosomal localization of D-TACC and Msps. Arl2 physically associates with tubulin cofactors C, D, and E.

A Polymorphism in the Processing Body Component Ge-1 Controls Resistance to a Naturally Occurring Rhabdovirus in Drosophila,26799957,10.1371/journal.ppat.1005387,"Hosts encounter an ever-changing array of pathogens, so there is continual selection for novel ways to resist infection. A powerful way to understand how hosts evolve resistance is to identify the genes that cause variation in susceptibility to infection. Using high-resolution genetic mapping we have identified a naturally occurring polymorphism in a gene called Ge-1 that makes Drosophila melanogaster highly resistant to its natural pathogen Drosophila melanogaster sigma virus (DMelSV). By modifying the sequence of the gene in transgenic flies, we identified a 26 amino acid deletion in the serine-rich linker region of Ge-1 that is causing the resistance. Knocking down the expression of the susceptible allele leads to a decrease in viral titre in infected flies, indicating that Ge-1 is an existing restriction factor whose antiviral effects have been increased by the deletion. Ge-1 plays a central role in RNA degradation and the formation of processing bodies (P bodies). A key effector in antiviral immunity, the RNAi induced silencing complex (RISC), localises to P bodies, but we found that Ge-1-based resistance is not dependent on the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway. However, we found that Decapping protein 1 (DCP1) protects flies against sigma virus. This protein interacts with Ge-1 and commits mRNA for degradation by removing the 5' cap, suggesting that resistance may rely on this RNA degradation pathway. The serine-rich linker domain of Ge-1 has experienced strong selection during the evolution of Drosophila, suggesting that this gene may be under long-term selection by viruses. These findings demonstrate that studying naturally occurring polymorphisms that increase resistance to infections enables us to identify novel forms of antiviral defence, and support a pattern of major effect polymorphisms controlling resistance to viruses in Drosophila.",2016,"Chuan Cao, Michael M Magwire, Florian Bayer, Francis M Jiggins, Chuan Cao, Michael M Magwire, Florian Bayer, Francis M Jiggins"
The Deadbeat Paternal Effect of Uncapped Sperm Telomeres on Cell Cycle Progression and Chromosome Behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,27029731,10.1534/genetics.115.182436,"Telomere-capping complexes (TCCs) protect the ends of linear chromosomes from illegitimate repair and end-to-end fusions and are required for genome stability. The identity and assembly of TCC components have been extensively studied, but whether TCCs require active maintenance in nondividing cells remains an open question. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster requires Deadbeat (Ddbt), a sperm nuclear basic protein (SNBP) that is recruited to the telomere by the TCC and is required for TCC maintenance during genome-wide chromatin remodeling, which transforms spermatids to mature sperm. Ddbt-deficient males produce sperm lacking TCCs. Their offspring delay the initiation of anaphase as early as cycle 1 but progress through the first two cycles. Persistence of uncapped paternal chromosomes induces arrest at or around cycle 3. This early arrest can be rescued by selective elimination of paternal chromosomes and production of gynogenetic haploid or haploid mosaics. Progression past cycle 3 can also occur if embryos have reduced levels of the maternally provided checkpoint kinase Chk2. The findings provide insights into how telomere integrity affects the regulation of the earliest embryonic cell cycles. They also suggest that other SNBPs, including those in humans, may have analogous roles and manifest as paternal effects on embryo quality.",2016,"Takuo Yamaki, Glenn K Yasuda, Barbara T Wakimoto, Takuo Yamaki, Glenn K Yasuda, Barbara T Wakimoto"

Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster to model this mutation and dissect its effects on the biochemical and biophysical properties of myosin, as well as on the structure and physiology of skeletal and cardiac muscles. P838L mutant myosin isolated from indirect flight muscles of transgenic Drosophila showed elevated ATPase and actin sliding velocity in vitro. Furthermore, the mutant heads exhibited increased rotational flexibility, and there was an increase in the average angle between the two heads. Indirect flight muscle myofibril assembly was minimally affected in mutant homozygotes, and isolated fibers displayed normal mechanical properties. However, myofibrils degraded during aging, correlating with reduced flight abilities. In contrast, hearts from homozygotes and heterozygotes showed normal morphology, myofibrillar arrays, and contractile parameters. When P838L was placed in trans to Mhc(5), an allele known to cause cardiac restriction in flies, it did not yield the constricted phenotype. Overall, our studies suggest that increased rotational flexibility of myosin S1 enhances myosin ATPase and actin sliding.

To date, few studies have assessed the potential risks of genetically engineered crops or insecticidal compounds on the survival and fitness of dipteran species, despite their important contribution to ecosystem services such as decomposition in agricultural systems. Therefore, we propose that Drosophila melanogaster Meigen (Drosophilidae) be used as a surrogate species for the order Diptera and for the functional guild of soil arthropod decomposers in pre-market risk assessments. We developed two assays to assess the toxicity of gut-active insecticidal compounds to D. melanogaster. One assay uses groups of fly larvae, and the other uses individuals. Cryolite, a mineral pesticide, proved to be an adequate positive control. The effects of cryolite on D. melanogaster larvae were comparable between the two assays. Statistical power analyses were used to define the number of replications required to identify different effect sizes between control and treatment groups. Finally, avidin, E-64, GNA, and SBTI were used as test compounds to validate the individual-based assay; only avidin adversely affected D. melanogaster.

Impact of the Chromatin Remodeling Factor CHD1 on Gut Microbiome Composition of Drosophila melanogaster,27093431,10.1371/journal.pone.0153476,"The composition of the intestinal microbiota of Drosophila has been studied in some detail in recent years. Environmental, developmental and host-specific genetic factors influence microbiome composition in the fly. Our previous work has indicated that intestinal bacterial load can be affected by chromatin-targeted regulatory mechanisms. Here we studied a potential role of the conserved chromatin assembly and remodeling factor CHD1 in the shaping of the gut microbiome in Drosophila melanogaster. Using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, we found that Chd1 deletion mutant flies exhibit significantly reduced microbial diversity compared to rescued control strains. Specifically, although Acetobacteraceae dominated the microbiota of both Chd1 wild-type and mutant guts, Chd1 mutants were virtually monoassociated with this bacterial family, whereas in control flies other bacterial taxa constituted ~20% of the microbiome.

Synaptic transmission parallels neuromodulation in a central food-intake circuit,27845623,10.7554/eLife.16799,"NeuromedinU is a potent regulator of food intake and activity in mammals. In Drosophila, neurons producing the homologous neuropeptide hugin regulate feeding and locomotion in a similar manner. Here, we use EM-based reconstruction to generate the entire connectome of hugin-producing neurons in the Drosophila larval CNS. We demonstrate that hugin neurons use synaptic transmission in addition to peptidergic neuromodulation and identify acetylcholine as a key transmitter. Hugin neuropeptide and acetylcholine are both necessary for the regulatory effect on feeding. We further show that subtypes of hugin neurons connect chemosensory to endocrine system by combinations of synaptic and peptide-receptor connections. Targets include endocrine neurons producing DH44, a CRH-like peptide, and insulin-like peptides. Homologs of these peptides are likewise downstream of neuromedinU, revealing striking parallels in flies and mammals.

Potential Direct Regulators of the Drosophila yellow Gene Identified by Yeast One-Hybrid and RNAi Screens,27527791,10.1534/g3.116.032607,"The regulation of gene expression controls development, and changes in this regulation often contribute to phenotypic evolution. Drosophila pigmentation is a model system for studying evolutionary changes in gene regulation, with differences in expression of pigmentation genes such as yellow that correlate with divergent pigment patterns among species shown to be caused by changes in cis- and trans-regulation. Currently, much more is known about the cis-regulatory component of divergent yellow expression than the trans-regulatory component, in part because very few trans-acting regulators of yellow expression have been identified. This study aims to improve our understanding of the trans-acting control of yellow expression by combining yeast-one-hybrid and RNAi screens for transcription factors binding to yellow cis-regulatory sequences and affecting abdominal pigmentation in adults, respectively. Of the 670 transcription factors included in the yeast-one-hybrid screen, 45 showed evidence of binding to one or more sequence fragments tested from the 5' intergenic and intronic yellow sequences from D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, and D. willistoni, suggesting that they might be direct regulators of yellow expression. Of the 670 transcription factors included in the yeast-one-hybrid screen, plus another TF previously shown to be genetically upstream of yellow, 125 were also tested using RNAi, and 32 showed altered abdominal pigmentation. Nine transcription factors were identified in both screens, including four nuclear receptors related to ecdysone signaling (Hr78, Hr38, Hr46, and Eip78C). This finding suggests that yellow expression might be directly controlled by nuclear receptors influenced by ecdysone during early pupal development when adult pigmentation is forming.",2016,"Gizem Kalay, Richard Lusk, Mackenzie Dome, Korneel Hens, Bart Deplancke, Patricia J Wittkopp, Gizem Kalay, Richard Lusk, Mackenzie Dome, Korneel Hens, Bart Deplancke, Patricia J Wittkopp"
miR-190 Enhances HIF-Dependent Responses to Hypoxia in Drosophila by Inhibiting the Prolyl-4-hydroxylase Fatiga,27223464,10.1371/journal.pgen.1006073,"Cellular and systemic responses to low oxygen levels are principally mediated by Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIFs), a family of evolutionary conserved heterodimeric transcription factors, whose alpha- and beta-subunits belong to the bHLH-PAS family. In normoxia, HIFÎ± is hydroxylated by specific prolyl-4-hydroxylases, targeting it for proteasomal degradation, while in hypoxia the activity of these hydroxylases decreases due to low oxygen availability, leading to HIFÎ± accumulation and expression of HIF target genes. To identify microRNAs required for maximal HIF activity, we conducted an overexpression screen in Drosophila melanogaster, evaluating the induction of a HIF transcriptional reporter. miR-190 overexpression enhanced HIF-dependent biological responses, including terminal sprouting of the tracheal system, while in miR-190 loss of function embryos the hypoxic response was impaired. In hypoxic conditions, miR-190 expression was upregulated and required for induction of HIF target genes by directly inhibiting the HIF prolyl-4-hydroxylase Fatiga. Thus, miR-190 is a novel regulator of the hypoxia response that represses the oxygen sensor Fatiga, leading to HIFÎ± stabilization and enhancement of hypoxic responses.",2016,"Ana Laura De Lella Ezcurra, Agustina Paola Bertolin, Kevin Kim, Maximiliano Javier Katz, Lautaro GÃ¡ndara, Tvisha Misra, Stefan Luschnig, Norbert Perrimon, Mariana Melani, Pablo Wappner, Ana Laura De Lella Ezcurra, Agustina Paola Bertolin, Kevin Kim, Maximiliano Javier Katz, Lautaro GÃ¡ndara, Tvisha Misra, Stefan Luschnig, Norbert Perrimon, Mariana Melani, Pablo Wappner"
Whole-Genome Sequencing and iPLEX MassARRAY Genotyping Map an EMS-Induced Mutation Affecting Cell Competition in Drosophila melanogaster,27574103,10.1534/g3.116.029421,"Cell competition, the conditional loss of viable genotypes only when surrounded by other cells, is a phenomenon observed in certain genetic mosaic conditions.

Mutations were identified by whole-genome sequencing, making use of software tools that greatly facilitate the distinction between newly induced mutations and other sources of apparent sequence polymorphism, thereby reducing false-positive and false-negative identification rates. In addition, we utilized iPLEX MassARRAY for genotyping recombinant chromosomes. These approaches permitted the mapping of a new mutation affecting cell competition when only a single allele existed, with a phenotype assessed only in genetic mosaics, without the benefit of complementation with existing mutations, deletions, or duplications.

Previous studies have proposed that loss of FXN causes mitochondrial dysfunction, which triggers elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and leads to the demise of neurons. Here we describe a ROS independent mechanism that contributes to neurodegeneration in fly FXN mutants. We show that loss of frataxin homolog (fh) in Drosophila leads to iron toxicity, which in turn induces sphingolipid synthesis and ectopically activates 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (Pdk1) and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2). Dampening iron toxicity, inhibiting sphingolipid synthesis by Myriocin, or reducing Pdk1 or Mef2 levels, all effectively suppress neurodegeneration in fh mutants. Moreover, increasing dihydrosphingosine activates Mef2 activity through PDK1 in mammalian neuronal cell line suggesting that the mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved.

The method described here assesses fuel oxidation in small numbers of adult flies fed food containing trace amounts of (14)C-labeled substrates such as glucose or fatty acid. After the feeding period and any additional experimental manipulations, flies are transferred to short tubes capped with mesh, which are then placed in glass vials containing KOH-saturated filter paper that traps exhaled, radiolabeled CO2 generated from oxidation of radiolabeled substrates as potassium bicarbonate, KHCO3. This radiolabeled bicarbonate is measured by scintillation counting. This is a quantitative, reproducible, and simple approach for the study of fuel oxidation. The use of radiolabeled glucose, fatty acids, or amino acids allows determination of the contribution of these different fuel sources to energy metabolism under different conditions such as feeding and fasting and in different genetic backgrounds.

Polyamines in brown rice vinegar function as potent attractants for the spotted wing drosophila,27591976,10.1016/j.jbiosc.2016.06.014,"Vinegar produced by acetic acid bacteria is used as an attractant for fruit flies. Apple cider vinegar (ACV) and brown rice vinegar (BRV) are used as lures to detect Drosophila suzukii (also known as the spotted wing drosophila [SWD], a newly emerging invasive pest of soft-skinned fruits) and to capture Drosophila melanogaster, respectively. In the present study, we evaluated the attractiveness of BRV and ACV to SWD in laboratory trapping experiments using an upturned microcentrifuge tube with a pipette tip as a trap. We transferred SWD (approximately 20, 7-10 days old) to a glass vial containing a trap baited with BRV or ACV and counted the captured flies. BRV attracted more flies (52.88 Â± 9.75%) than ACV (35.78 Â± 7.47%) in 6 h.

The attractiveness of ACV supplemented with putrescine (12 Î¼M) and spermidine (35 Î¼M) (68.56 Â± 4.69%) was significantly higher than that of ACV, indicating that the enhanced attractiveness of BRV to SWD was accomplished by the additive effects of polyamines and other known attractive volatiles, such as acetic acid and acetoin.

We also discuss the ways in which microRNAs affect robustness. Many gene regulatory networks are robust; they are relatively insensitive to the precise values of reaction constants and concentrations of molecules acting within the networks. MicroRNAs involved in robustness appear to be nonessential under uniform conditions used in conventional laboratory experiments.

This has been implemented on Apache Spark and used to analyse two D. melanogaster eye-antennal disc data sets generated at the same laboratory.

Insulin-like peptide DILP6 regulates juvenile hormone and dopamine metabolism in Drosophila females,27823956,10.1016/j.ygcen.2016.11.004,"Insulin-like peptide DILP6 is a component of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling pathway of Drosophila. Juvenile hormone (JH) and dopamine (DA) are involved in the stress response and in the control of reproduction. In this study, we investigate whether DILP6 regulates the JH and DA levels by studying the effect of a strong hypomorphic mutation dilp641 on JH and DA metabolism in D. melanogaster females. We show that DILP6 regulates JH and DA metabolism: the mutation dilp641 results in a reduction in JH-hydrolysing activity and an increase in the activities of DA synthesis enzymes (alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)). In the mutant females, we also found increased fecundity in addition to the intensity of the response (stress reactivity) of ALP and TH to heat stress. As we showed previously, this suggests an increased level of JH synthesis. We confirm this suggestion by treating the mutant females with the JH inhibitor, precocene, which restors the activity and stress reactivity of ALP and TH as well as fecundity to levels similar to those in the control flies. The data suggest a feedback system in the interaction between JH and DILP6 in which DILP6 negatively regulates the JH titre via an increase in the hormone degradation and a decrease in its synthesis.",2017,"I Yu Rauschenbach, E K Karpova, E V Burdina, N V Adonyeva, R A Bykov, Y Y Ilinsky, P N Menshanov, N E Gruntenko, I Yu Rauschenbach, E K Karpova, E V Burdina, N V Adonyeva, R A Bykov, Y Y Ilinsky, P N Menshanov, N E Gruntenko"
The zinc-finger transcription factor Hindsight regulates ovulation competency of Drosophila follicles,29256860,10.7554/eLife.29887,"Follicle rupture, the final step in ovulation, utilizes conserved molecular mechanisms including matrix metalloproteinases (Mmps), steroid signaling, and adrenergic signaling.

Hnt is not expressed in immature stage-13 follicle cells but is upregulated in mature stage-14 follicle cells, which is essential for follicle rupture/ovulation. Hnt upregulates Mmp2 expression in posterior follicle cells (essential for the breakdown of the follicle wall) and Oamb expression in all follicle cells (the receptor for receiving adrenergic signaling and inducing Mmp2 activation). Hnt's role in regulating Mmp2 and Oamb can be replaced by its human homolog Ras-responsive element-binding protein 1 (RREB-1).

Adipocyte Metabolic Pathways Regulated by Diet Control the Female Germline Stem Cell Lineage in Drosophila melanogaster,28396508,10.1534/genetics.117.201921,"Nutrients affect adult stem cells through complex mechanisms involving multiple organs. Adipocytes are highly sensitive to diet and have key metabolic roles, and obesity increases the risk for many cancers. How diet-regulated adipocyte metabolic pathways influence normal stem cell lineages, however, remains unclear. Drosophila melanogaster has highly conserved adipocyte metabolism and a well-characterized female germline stem cell (GSC) lineage response to diet. Here, we conducted an isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) proteomic analysis to identify diet-regulated adipocyte metabolic pathways that control the female GSC lineage. On a rich (relative to poor) diet, adipocyte Hexokinase-C and metabolic enzymes involved in pyruvate/acetyl-CoA production are upregulated, promoting a shift of glucose metabolism toward macromolecule biosynthesis. Adipocyte-specific knockdown shows that these enzymes support early GSC progeny survival. Further, enzymes catalyzing fatty acid oxidation and phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis in adipocytes promote GSC maintenance, whereas lipid and iron transport from adipocytes controls vitellogenesis and GSC number, respectively. These results show a functional relationship between specific metabolic pathways in adipocytes and distinct processes in the GSC lineage, suggesting the adipocyte metabolism-stem cell link as an important area of investigation in other stem cell systems.",2017,"Shinya Matsuoka, Alissa R Armstrong, Leesa L Sampson, Kaitlin M Laws, Daniela Drummond-Barbosa, Shinya Matsuoka, Alissa R Armstrong, Leesa L Sampson, Kaitlin M Laws, Daniela Drummond-Barbosa"
Occupational allergy to fruit flies ( Drosophila melanogaster) in laboratory workers,28039199,10.1136/oemed-2016-103834,"Objectives:
      
Drosophila melanogaster (the 'fruit fly') is commonly used in genetic research, but there is only one report of IgE-associated allergy in exposed workers. 4 newly identified cases prompted us to examine the extent of this problem in a university laboratory. Our aim in this study is to determine the prevalence and determinants of sensitisation to fruit flies in a population of exposed workers.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      In a cross-sectional study, we surveyed 286 employees working in a department carrying out research involving D. melanogaster. Sensitisation was assessed by specific IgE measurement in serum and examined in relation to symptoms and to estimated exposure to fruit flies.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The overall prevalence of specific sensitisation was 6% with a clear relationship to increasing frequency/intensity of exposure (p trend<0.001). Work-related eye/nose, chest or skin symptoms were reported by substantial proportions of participants but for most of these there was no evidence of specific sensitisation to fruit fly. The overall prevalence of any work-related symptoms and sensitisation was 2.4%, rising to 7.1% in those working in high exposure groups.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:

Sex and Genetic Background Influence Superoxide Dismutase (cSOD)-Related Phenotypic Variation in Drosophila melanogaster,28624774,10.1534/g3.117.043836,"Mutations often have drastically different effects in different genetic backgrounds; understanding a gene's biological function then requires an understanding of its interaction with genetic diversity. The antioxidant enzyme cytosolic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (cSOD) catalyzes the dismutation of the superoxide radical, a molecule that can induce oxidative stress if its concentration exceeds cellular control. Accordingly, Drosophila melanogaster lacking functional cSOD exhibit a suite of phenotypes including decreased longevity, hypersensitivity to oxidative stress, impaired locomotion, and reduced NADP(H) enzyme activity in males. To date, cSOD-null phenotypes have primarily been characterized using males carrying one allele, cSodn108red, in a single genetic background. We used ANOVA, and the effect size partial eta squared, to partition the amount of variation attributable to cSOD activity, sex, and genetic background across a series of life history, locomotor, and biochemical phenotypes associated with the cSOD-null condition. Overall, the results demonstrate that the cSOD-null syndrome is largely consistent across sex and genetic background, but also significantly influenced by both. The sex-specific effects are particularly striking and our results support the idea that phenotypes cannot be considered to be fully defined if they are examined in limited genetic contexts.",2017,"Courtney E Lessel, Tony L Parkes, Joel Dickinson, Thomas J S Merritt, Courtney E Lessel, Tony L Parkes, Joel Dickinson, Thomas J S Merritt"
Activation of Discs large by aPKC aligns the mitotic spindle to the polarity axis during asymmetric cell division,29185419,10.7554/eLife.32137,"Asymmetric division generates cellular diversity by producing daughter cells with different fates. In animals, the mitotic spindle aligns with Par complex polarized fate determinants, ensuring that fate determinant cortical domains are bisected by the cleavage furrow.

We find that the tumor suppressor Discs large (Dlg) links the Par complex component atypical Protein Kinase C (aPKC) to the essential spindle orientation factor GukHolder (GukH). Dlg is autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between its SH3 and GK domains, preventing Dlg interaction with GukH at cortical sites lacking aPKC. When co-localized with aPKC, Dlg is phosphorylated in its SH3 domain which disrupts autoinhibition and allows GukH recruitment by the GK domain.

High rate of translocation-based gene birth on the Drosophila Y chromosome,29078298,10.1073/pnas.1706502114,"The Y chromosome is a unique genetic environment defined by a lack of recombination and male-limited inheritance. The Drosophila Y chromosome has been gradually acquiring genes from the rest of the genome, with only seven Y-linked genes being gained over the past 63 million years (0.12 gene gains per million years). Using a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-powered genomic scan, we show that gene transfers to the Y chromosome are much more common than previously suspected: at least 25 have arisen across three Drosophila species over the past 5.4 million years (1.67 per million years for each lineage). The gene transfer rate is significantly lower in Drosophila melanogaster than in the Drosophila simulans clade, primarily due to Y-linked retrotranspositions being significantly more common in the latter. Despite all Y-linked gene transfers being evolutionarily recent (<1 million years old), only three showed evidence for purifying selection (? ??0.14). Thus, although the resulting Y-linked functional gene acquisition rate (0.25 new genes per million years) is double the longer-term estimate, the fate of most new Y-linked genes is defined by rapid degeneration and pseudogenization. Our results show that Y-linked gene traffic, and the molecular mechanisms governing these transfers, can diverge rapidly between species, revealing the Drosophila Y chromosome to be more dynamic than previously appreciated. Our analytical method provides a powerful means to identify Y-linked gene transfers and will help illuminate the evolutionary dynamics of the Y chromosome in Drosophila and other species.",2017,"Ray Tobler, Viola Nolte, Christian SchlÃ¶tterer, Ray Tobler, Viola Nolte, Christian SchlÃ¶tterer"

We find that populations with faster development and faster aging have increased heart dysfunction, measured as percentage heart failure after electrical pacing. Experimental evolution of different triglyceride levels, by contrast, has little effect on heart function.

Discrete Serotonin Systems Mediate Memory Enhancement and Escape Latencies after Unpredicted Aversive Experience in Drosophila Place Memory,29321732,10.3389/fnsys.2017.00092,"Feedback mechanisms in operant learning are critical for animals to increase reward or reduce punishment. However, not all conditions have a behavior that can readily resolve an event. Animals must then try out different behaviors to better their situation through outcome learning. This form of learning allows for novel solutions and with positive experience can lead to unexpected behavioral routines. Learned helplessness, as a type of outcome learning, manifests in part as increases in escape latency in the face of repeated unpredicted shocks. Little is known about the mechanisms of outcome learning. When fruit fly Drosophilamelanogaster are exposed to unpredicted high temperatures in a place learning paradigm, flies both increase escape latencies and have a higher memory when given control of a place/temperature contingency. Here we describe discrete serotonin neuronal circuits that mediate aversive reinforcement, escape latencies, and memory levels after place learning in the presence and absence of unexpected aversive events. The results show that two features of learned helplessness depend on the same modulatory system as aversive reinforcement. Moreover, changes in aversive reinforcement and escape latency depend on local neural circuit modulation, while memory enhancement requires larger modulation of multiple behavioral control circuits.",2017,"Divya Sitaraman, Elizabeth F Kramer, Lily Kahsai, Daniela Ostrowski, Troy Zars, Divya Sitaraman, Elizabeth F Kramer, Lily Kahsai, Daniela Ostrowski, Troy Zars"
Neuroligin 4 regulates synaptic growth via the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction,28912273,10.1074/jbc.M117.810242,"The neuroligin (Nlg) family of neural cell adhesion molecules is thought to be required for synapse formation and development and has been linked to the development of autism spectrum disorders in humans. In Drosophila melanogaster, mutations in the neuroligin 1-3 genes have been reported to induce synapse developmental defects at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), but the role of neuroligin 4 (dnlg4) in synapse development has not been determined. Here, we report that the Drosophila neuroligin 4 (DNlg4) is different from DNlg1-3 in that it presynaptically regulates NMJ synapse development. Loss of dnlg4 results in reduced growth of NMJs with fewer synaptic boutons. The morphological defects caused by dnlg4 mutant are associated with a corresponding decrease in synaptic transmission efficacy. All of these defects could only be rescued when DNlg4 was expressed in the presynapse of NMJs. To understand the basis of DNlg4 function, we looked for genetic interactions and found connections with the components of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway. Immunostaining and Western blot analyses demonstrated that the regulation of NMJ growth by DNlg4 was due to the positive modulation of BMP signaling by DNlg4.

Linear functional response by two pupal Drosophila parasitoids foraging within single or multiple patch environments,28829796,10.1371/journal.pone.0183525,"Functional response describes the number of prey or hosts attacked by a predator or parasitoid as a function of prey or host density.

A linear function response is considered unusual for insect parasitoids. The first design was a 'fixed time within patch experiment' where individual parasitoids were exposed to a range of host densities for 24 h; the second two designs were a 'variable time functional response' and a 'selective functional response' experiments where individual parasitoids were presented with a range of host patches and allowed to freely select and explore only one patch (variable time) or forage for 24 h (selective). In all experimental designs, the number of hosts parasitized increased linearly until reaching an upper limit. Under the laboratory conditions used, the functional response of P. vindemiae was limited by its egg supply and time (host handling time) whereas T. drosophilae was limited by time only. The linear functional response by both parasitoids likely resulted from a constant attack rate and an incremental foraging strategy where the parasitoids left a poor (low density) host patch or remained in a higher quality host patch when there was successful oviposition and adequate host density.",2017,"GÃ¼lay KaÃ§ar, Xin-Geng Wang, Antonio Biondi, Kent M Daane, GÃ¼lay KaÃ§ar, Xin-Geng Wang, Antonio Biondi, Kent M Daane"
Presynaptic LRP4 promotes synapse number and function of excitatory CNS neurons,28606304,10.7554/eLife.27347,"Precise coordination of synaptic connections ensures proper information flow within circuits. The activity of presynaptic organizing molecules signaling to downstream pathways is essential for such coordination, though such entities remain incompletely known. We show that LRP4, a conserved transmembrane protein known for its postsynaptic roles, functions presynaptically as an organizing molecule. In the Drosophila brain, LRP4 localizes to the nerve terminals at or near active zones. Loss of presynaptic LRP4 reduces excitatory (not inhibitory) synapse number, impairs active zone architecture, and abolishes olfactory attraction - the latter of which can be suppressed by reducing presynaptic GABAB receptors. LRP4 overexpression increases synapse number in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, suggesting an instructive role and a common downstream synapse addition pathway. Mechanistically, LRP4 functions via the conserved kinase SRPK79D to ensure normal synapse number and behavior. This highlights a presynaptic function for LRP4, enabling deeper understanding of how synapse organization is coordinated.",2017,"Timothy J Mosca, David J Luginbuhl, Irving E Wang, Liqun Luo, Timothy J Mosca, David J Luginbuhl, Irving E Wang, Liqun Luo"
Data of sperm-entry inability in Drosophila melanogaster ovarian follicles that are depleted of s36 chorionic protein,28443296,10.1016/j.dib.2017.03.052,"This paper presents data associated with the research article entitled ""Targeted downregulation of s36 protein unearths its cardinal role in chorion biogenesis and architecture during Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis"" [1]. Drosophila chorion is produced by epithelial follicle cells and one of its functional serving role is egg fertilization through the micropyle, a specialized narrow channel at the anterior tip of the egg [2]. Sperm entry during fertilization is necessary for the egg to complete meiosis [3]. D. melanogaster flies being characterized by severe downregulation of the s36 chorionic protein, specifically in the follicle-cell compartment of their ovary, appear with impaired fly fertility (Velentzas et al., 2016) [1]. In an effort to further investigate whether the observed infertility in the s36-targeted flies derives from a fertilization failure, such as the inability of sperm to pass through egg×³s micropyle, we mated females carrying s36-depleted ovaries with males expressing the GFP protein either in their sperm tails, or in both their sperm tails and sperm heads.",2017,"Athanassios D Velentzas, Panagiotis D Velentzas, Stamatia Katarachia, Vassiliki E Mpakou, Issidora S Papassideri, Dimitrios J Stravopodis"
Failure to reproduce period-dependent song cycles in Drosophila is due to poor automated pulse-detection and low-intensity courtship,28174268,10.1073/pnas.1615198114,"Stern has criticized a body of work from several groups that have independently studied the so-called ""Kyriacou and Hall"" courtship song rhythms of male Drosophila melanogaster, claiming that these ultradian ??0-s cycles in the interpulse interval (IPI) are statistical artifacts that are not modulated by mutations at the period (per) locus [Stern DL (2014) BMC Biol 12:38]. We have scrutinized Stern's raw data and observe that his automated song pulse-detection method identifies only ??0% of the IPIs found by manual (visual and acoustic) monitoring. This critical error is further compounded by Stern's use of recordings with very little song, the large majority of which do not meet the minimal song intensity criteria which Kyriacou and Hall used in their studies. Consequently most of Stern's recordings only contribute noise to the analyses. Of the data presented by Stern, only perL and a small fraction of wild-type males sing vigorously, so we limited our reanalyses to these genotypes. We manually reexamined Stern's raw song recordings and analyzed IPI rhythms using several independent time-series analyses. We observe that perL songs show significantly longer song periods than wild-type songs, with values for both genotypes close to those found in previous studies. These per-dependent differences disappear when the song data are randomized. We conclude that Stern's negative findings are artifacts of his inadequate pulse-detection methodology coupled to his use of low-intensity courtship song records.",2017,"Charalambos P Kyriacou, Edward W Green, Arianna Piffer, Harold B Dowse, Charalambos P Kyriacou, Edward W Green, Arianna Piffer, Harold B Dowse"
Genomic responses to the socio-sexual environment in male Drosophila melanogaster exposed to conspecific rivals,28428330,10.1261/rna.059246.116,"Socio-sexual environments have profound effects on fitness. Local sex ratios can alter the threat of sexual competition, to which males respond via plasticity in reproductive behaviors and ejaculate composition. In Drosophila melanogaster, males detect the presence of conspecific, same-sex mating rivals prior to mating using multiple, redundant sensory cues. Males that respond to rivals gain significant fitness benefits by altering mating duration and ejaculate composition. Here we investigated the underlying genome-wide changes involved. We used RNA-seq to analyze male transcriptomic responses 2, 26, and 50 h after exposure to rivals, a time period that was previously identified as encompassing the major facets of male responses to rivals. The results showed a strong early activation of multiple sensory genes in the head-thorax (HT), prior to the expression of any phenotypic differences. This gene expression response was reduced by 26 h, at the time of maximum phenotypic change, and shut off by 50 h. In the abdomen (A), fewer genes changed in expression and gene expression responses appeared to increase over time. The results also suggested that different sets of functionally equivalent genes might be activated in different replicates. This could represent a mechanism by which robustness is conferred upon highly plastic traits. Overall, our study reveals that mRNA-seq can identify subtle genomic signatures characteristic of flexible behavioral phenotypes.",2017,"Irina Mohorianu, Amanda Bretman, Damian T Smith, Emily K Fowler, Tamas Dalmay, Tracey Chapman, Irina Mohorianu, Amanda Bretman, Damian T Smith, Emily K Fowler, Tamas Dalmay, Tracey Chapman"
MicroRNAs That Contribute to Coordinating the Immune Response in Drosophila melanogaster,28706002,10.1534/genetics.116.196584,"Small noncoding RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression related to host defenses. Here, we have used Drosophila melanogaster to explore the contribution of individual or clusters of miRNAs in countering systemic Candida albicans infection. From a total of 72 tested, we identify 6 miRNA allelic mutant backgrounds that modulate the survival response to infection and the ability to control pathogen number. These mutants also exhibit dysregulation of the Toll pathway target transcripts Drosomycin (Drs) and Immune-Induced Molecule 1 (IM1). These are characteristics of defects in Toll signaling, and consistent with this, we demonstrate dependency for one of the miRNA mutants on the NF-Îº? homolog Dif. We also quantify changes in the miRNA expression profile over time in response to three pathogen types, and identify 13 mature miRNA forms affected by pathogens that stimulate Toll signaling. To complement this, we provide a genome-wide map of potential NF-ÎºB sites in proximity to miRNA genes. Finally, we demonstrate that systemic C. albicans infection contributes to a reduction in the total amount of branch-chained amino acids, which is miRNA-regulated. Overall, our data reveal a new layer of miRNA complexity regulating the fly response to systemic fungal infection.",2017,"Magda L Atilano, Marcus Glittenberg, Annabel Monteiro, Richard R Copley, Petros Ligoxygakis, Magda L Atilano, Marcus Glittenberg, Annabel Monteiro, Richard R Copley, Petros Ligoxygakis"
Diverse subcellular localizations of the insect CMP-sialic acid synthetases,27986833,10.1093/glycob/cww128,"The occurrence and biological importance of sialic acid (Sia) and its metabolic enzymes in insects have been studied using Drosophila melanogaster. The most prominent feature of D. melanogaster CMP-Sia synthetase (DmCSS) is its Golgi-localization, contrasted with nuclear localization of vertebrate CSSs. However, it remains unclear if the Golgi-localization is common to other insect CSSs and why it happens. To answer these questions, Aedes aegypti (mosquito) CSS (AaCSS) and Tribolium castaneum (beetle) CSS (TcCSS) were cloned and characterized for their activity and subcellular localization. Our new findings show: (1) AaCSS and TcCSS share a common overall structure with DmCSS in terms of evolutionarily conserved motifs and the absence of the C-terminal domain typical to vertebrate CSSs; (2) when expressed in mammalian and insect cells, AaCSS and TcCSS showed in vivo and in vitro CSS activities, similar to DmCSS. In contrast, when expressed in bacteria, they lacked CSS activity because the N-terminal hydrophobic region appeared to induce protein aggregation; (3) when expressed in Drosophila S2 cells, AaCSS and TcCSS were predominantly localized in the ER, but not in the Golgi. Surprisingly, DmCSS was mainly secreted into the culture medium, although partially detected in Golgi. Consistent with these results, the N-terminal hydrophobic regions of AaCSS and TcCSS functioned as a signal peptide to render them soluble in the ER, while the N-terminus of DmCSS functioned as a membrane-spanning region of type II transmembrane proteins whose cytosolic KLK sequence functioned as an ER export signal. Accordingly, the differential subcellular localization of insect CSSs are distinctively more diverse than previously recognized.",2017,"Wu Di, Akiko Fujita, Kayo Hamaguchi, Philippe Delannoy, Chihiro Sato, Ken Kitajima, Wu Di, Akiko Fujita, Kayo Hamaguchi, Philippe Delannoy, Chihiro Sato, Ken Kitajima"
The Drosophila speciation factor HMR localizes to genomic insulator sites,28207793,10.1371/journal.pone.0171798,"Hybrid incompatibility between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans is caused by a lethal interaction of the proteins encoded by the Hmr and Lhr genes. In D. melanogaster the loss of HMR results in mitotic defects, an increase in transcription of transposable elements and a deregulation of heterochromatic genes. To better understand the molecular mechanisms that mediate HMR's function, we measured genome-wide localization of HMR in D. melanogaster tissue culture cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Interestingly, we find HMR localizing to genomic insulator sites that can be classified into two groups. One group belongs to gypsy insulators and another one borders HP1a bound regions at active genes. The transcription of the latter group genes is strongly affected in larvae and ovaries of Hmr mutant flies. Our data suggest a novel link between HMR and insulator proteins, a finding that implicates a potential role for genome organization in the formation of species.",2017,"Thomas Andreas Gerland, Bo Sun, Pawel Smialowski, Andrea Lukacs, Andreas Walter Thomae, Axel Imhof"
Virus Innexins induce alterations in insect cell and tissue function,28077262,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.01.003,"Polydnaviruses are dsDNA viruses that induce immune and developmental alterations in their caterpillar hosts. Characterization of polydnavirus gene families and family members is necessary to understand mechanisms of pathology and evolution of these viruses, and may aid to elucidate the role of host homologues if present. For example, the polydnavirus vinnexin gene family encodes homologues of insect gap junction genes (innexins) that are expressed in host immune cells (hemocytes). While the roles of Innexin proteins and gap junctions in insect immunity are largely unclear, we previously demonstrated that Vinnexins form functional gap junctions and alter the junctional characteristics of a host Innexin when co-expressed in paired Xenopus oocytes. Here, we test the effect of ectopic vinnexin expression on host cell physiology using both a lepidopteran cell culture model and a dipteran whole organism model. Vinnexin expression in the cell culture system resulted in gene-specific alterations in cell morphology and a slight, but non-statistically significant, reduction in gap junction activity as measured by dye transfer, while ectopic expression of a lepidopteran innexin2 gene led to morphological alterations and increase in gap junction activity. Global ectopic expression in the model dipteran, Drosophila melanogaster, of one vinnexin (vinnexinG) or D. melanogaster innexin2 (Dm-inx2) resulted in embryonic lethality, while expression of the other vinnexin genes had no effect. Furthermore, ectopic expression of vinnexinG, but not other vinnexin genes or Dm-inx2, in D. melanogaster larval gut resulted in developmental arrest in the pupal stage. These data indicate the vinnexins likely have gene-specific roles in host manipulation. They also support the use of Drosophila in further analysis of the role of Vinnexins and other polydnavirus genes in modifying host physiological processes. Finally, our findings suggest the vinnexin genes may be useful to perturb and characterize the physiological functions of insect Innexins.",2017,"Daniel K Hasegawa, Stephanie L Erickson, Bradley M Hersh, Matthew W Turnbull, Daniel K Hasegawa, Stephanie L Erickson, Bradley M Hersh, Matthew W Turnbull"
"Mitochondrial DNA polymerase from Drosophila melanogaster embryos: kinetics, processivity, and fidelity of DNA polymerization",3142517,10.1021/bi00416a033,"The mitochondrial DNA polymerase from embryos of Drosophila melanogaster has been examined with regard to template-primer utilization, processivity, and fidelity of nucleotide polymerization.

Kinetic experiments and direct physical analysis of DNA synthetic products indicate that the Drosophila DNA polymerase gamma polymerizes nucleotides by a quasi-processive mechanism. The mitochondrial enzyme demonstrates a high degree of accuracy in nucleotide incorporation which is nearly identical with that of the replicative DNA polymerase alpha from Drosophila embryos. Thus, the catalytic properties of the near-homogeneous Drosophila DNA polymerase gamma are consistent with the in vivo requirements for mitochondrial DNA synthesis as described in a variety of animal systems.",1988,"C M Wernette, M C Conway, L S Kaguni, C M Wernette, M C Conway, L S Kaguni"

This model has previously been tested by classical quantitative-genetic means including sib-analysis and artificial selection. We used the approach of chromosome extraction, which has both advantages and disadvantages compared to classical techniques, to test the model further. From four isogenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster, four sets of recombinant extracted lines were constructed using standard balancer-chromosome techniques. The four parental lines and 53 recombinants were reared under controlled laboratory conditions and isolated as pairs for scoring daily fecundity and longevity. Even though the design is not optimal for estimating classical components of genetic variance, it afforded a uniquely direct test of the magnitude of environmental covariances, while giving a detailed genetic picture of part of the genome. There were clear differences among the recombinant series in the distribution of mean longevity and early fecundity. The genetic correlation between early fecundity (sum of egg production for the first five days posteclosion) and female longevity was significantly negative in only one of the recombinant series. When all lines were considered together, the phenotypic correlation between these traits was significantly negative (P < 0.02), while the broad-sense genetic correlation was -0.219 (P < 0.11). This result may be viewed as weakly consistent with the model of antagonistic pleiotropy, but other aspects of the data are at odds with the model.",1988,"Donna M Hughes, Andrew G Clark, Donna M Hughes, Andrew G Clark"

Localized heat-shock induction in Drosophila melanogaster,3141557,10.1002/jez.1402470312,"We describe a technique for inducing localized expression of genes fused to heat-shock gene promoters. We demonstrate that a localized heat-shock response can be induced in Drosophila melanogaster at any developmental stage after formation of the cellular blastoderm by contacting a region of the animal with a heated needle. The size of the induced region can be altered by varying parameters such as the temperature and size of the needle tip. The test system utilized here is a D. melanogaster strain transformed with a fusion of the Drosophila hsp26 gene and the E. coli lacZ gene; the activity of this hybrid gene is monitored in whole animals by staining for beta-galactosidase activity. Induced beta-galactosidase activity is confined to the cells in the region of heating; the beta-galactosidase activity can still be detected 48 hr after the heat shock. Given the heat inducibility of Drosophila heat-shock promoters in heterologous systems, we suggest that this technique will be useful for allowing spatially controlled induction of a gene of interest in any organism into which fusion genes can be introduced.

Supplemented NAD was found to increase survival at the lower temperatures and decrease survival at the higher temperatures. Further, for each temperature, NAD decreased development time although this effect diminished as temperature increased. There were no significant effects at the genotypic level.

We performed a direct measurement of the strength of negative selection acting on nonsense alleles of protein-coding genes in the Zambian population of Drosophila melanogaster. Within those exons that carry nonsense mutations, negative selection, assayed by the ratio of missense over synonymous nucleotide diversity levels, appears to be absent, consistent with total loss of function. In other exons of nonsense alleles, negative selection was deeply relaxed but likely not completely absent, and the per site number of missense alleles declined significantly with the distance from the premature stop codon.

There is a growing body of evidence that it regulates several nuclear functions including chromatin state and the proper functioning of centromeres and telomeres. The 1.688 satellite is one of the most abundant repetitive sequences in Drosophila melanogaster, with the longest array being located in the pericentromeric region of the X-chromosome. Short arrays of 1.688 repeats are widespread within the euchromatic part of the X-chromosome, and these arrays were recently suggested to assist in recognition of the X-chromosome by the dosage compensation male-specific lethal complex. We discovered that a short array of 1.688 satellite repeats is essential for recruitment of the protein POF to a previously described site on the X-chromosome (PoX2) and to various transgenic constructs. On an isolated target, i.e., an autosomic transgene consisting of a gene upstream of 1.688 satellite repeats, POF is recruited to the transgene in both males and females. The sequence of the satellite, as well as its length and position within the recruitment element, are the major determinants of targeting. Moreover, the 1.688 array promotes POF targeting to the roX1-proximal PoX1 site in trans Finally, binding of POF to the 1.688-related satellite-enriched sequences is conserved in evolution.

Last male sperm precedence is modulated by female remating rate in Drosophila melanogaster,30283675,10.1002/evl3.50,"Following multiple matings, sperm from different males compete for fertilization within the female reproductive tract. In many species, this competition results in an unequal sharing of paternity that favors the most recent mate, termed last male sperm precedence (LMSP). Much of our understanding of LMSP comes from studies in Drosophila melanogaster that focus on twice-mated females with standardized latencies between successive matings. Despite accumulating evidence indicating that females often mate with more than two males and exhibit variation in the latency between matings, the consequences of mating rate on LMSP are poorly understood. Here, we developed a paradigm utilizing D. melanogaster in which females remated at various time intervals with either two or three transgenic males that produce fluorescent sperm (green, red, or blue). This genetic manipulation enables paternity assessment of offspring and male-specific sperm fate examination in female reproductive tracts. We found that remating latency had no relationship with LMSP in females that mated with two males. However, LMSP was significantly reduced in thrice-mated females with short remating intervals; coinciding with reduced last-male sperm storage. Thus, female remating rate influences the relative share of paternity, the overall clutch paternity diversity, and ultimately the acquisition of indirect genetic benefits to potentially maximize female reproductive success.",2018,"Meghan Laturney, Roel van Eijk, Jean-Christophe Billeter, Meghan Laturney, Roel van Eijk, Jean-Christophe Billeter"
Ex Vivo Calcium Imaging for Visualizing Brain Responses to Endocrine Signaling in Drosophila,29912190,10.3791/57701,"Organ-to-organ communication by endocrine signaling, for example, from the periphery to the brain, is essential for maintaining homeostasis. As a model animal for endocrine research, Drosophila melanogaster, which has sophisticated genetic tools and genome information, is being increasingly used. This article describes a method for the calcium imaging of Drosophila brain explants. This method enables the detection of the direct signaling of a hormone to the brain. It is well known that many peptide hormones act through G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), whose activation causes an increase in the intracellular Ca2+concentration. Neural activation also elevates intracellular Ca2+ levels, from both Ca2+ influx and the release of Ca2+ stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A calcium sensor, GCaMP, can monitor these Ca2+ changes. In this method, GCaMP is expressed in the neurons of interest, and the GCaMP-expressing larval brain is dissected and cultured ex vivo. The test peptide is then applied to the brain explant, and the fluorescent changes in GCaMP are detected using a spinning disc confocal microscope equipped with a CCD camera. Using this method, any water-soluble molecule can be tested, and various cellular events associated with neural activation can be imaged using the appropriate fluorescent indicators. Moreover, by modifying the imaging chamber, this method can be used to image other Drosophila organs or the organs of other animals.",2018,"Hiroshi Ishimoto, Hiroko Sano, Hiroshi Ishimoto, Hiroko Sano"
Evaluation of the genotoxic properties of nickel oxide nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo,30442345,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2018.06.003,"Nickel-based nanoparticles (NPs) are new products with an increasing number of industrial applications that were developed in recent years. NiO NPs are present in several nanotechnological industrial products, and the characterization of their genotoxic potential is essential. The present study assessed the genotoxicity of NiO NPs in vivo and in vitro using the somatic mutation and recombination test in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster (SMART), the cytokinesis - block micronucleus assay (CBMN), and the comet assay in a V79 cell line. The NiO NPs used in this study were about 30 nm in mean size. Larvae of Drosophila melanogaster were exposed to 5 mL of five different concentrations (1.31, 2.62, 5.25, 10.5, and 21 mg/mL) of NiO NPs. In turn, V79 cells were treated with a concentration range of 15-2000 Î¼g/mL NiO NPs. The SMART showed that all concentrations of NiO NPs are genotoxic to the standart (ST) cross when compared to the negative control. On the other hand, only the highest concentration (21 mg/mL) was genotoxic to the HB cross. Somatic recombination was the preferential mechanism lesions were induced in D. melanogaster. The results show that NiO NPs were mutagenic to V79 cells as assessed by the CBMN assay. Significant differences in the frequencies of micronuclei (MN) were observed using the highest NiO NP concentrations (250 and 500 Î¼g/mL) in the 4- and 24-h treatments, but when 125 Î¼g/mL NiO NPs was used, such difference was observed only in the 4-h exposure time. The comet assay revealed that 62, 125, 250 and 500 Î¼g/mL NiO NPs induced a significant increase in DNA damage.

Toward a new insight of calcium oxalate stones in Drosophila by micro-computerized tomography,28260226,10.1007/s00240-017-0967-0,"We previously developed an animal model of calcium oxalate (CaOx) deposition on the Malphigian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster as a model of urolithiasis. Here, we introduce a new tool for the study of anatomical structure for Drosophila. As a consequence of technical development, the invention of micro-computerized tomography (CT) has been introduced to the small animal, such as rat and mice. We used Drosophila as a model organism and fed the flies 0.5% lithogenic agent ethylene glycol for 3 weeks. Samples were simply prepared for further scanned by micro-CT to scan samples at 800 nm resolution. CT scanning was performed at 40 kVp of voltage, 250 Î¼A of current, and 1750 ms of exposure time and without filter. Reconstruction of sections was carried out with the GPU-based scanner software. Specific region of interests was further analyzed by DataViewer software. Area with high radiologic density level was defined as CaOx deposition for further 3D analysis. Image of whole lithogenic Drosophila was compared with control. High radiologic density level was detected in the region of Malphigian tubules which can be identified as CaOx stones. There was no stone image in the control group. The image was the same as human non-contrast CT for the diagnosis of stone disease. Micro-CT clearly demonstrated the calcium oxalate calcifications in the Malphigian tubules of fruit fly.

Drosophila TNF Modulates Tissue Tension in the Embryo to Facilitate Macrophage Invasive Migration,29738712,10.1016/j.devcel.2018.04.002,"Migrating cells penetrate tissue barriers during development, inflammatory responses, and tumor metastasis. We study if migration in vivo in such three-dimensionally confined environments requires changes in the mechanical properties of the surrounding cells using embryonic Drosophila melanogaster hemocytes, also called macrophages, as a model. We find that macrophage invasion into the germband through transient separation of the apposing ectoderm and mesoderm requires cell deformations and reductions in apical tension in the ectoderm. Interestingly, the genetic pathway governing these mechanical shifts acts downstream of the only known tumor necrosis factor superfamily member in Drosophila, Eiger, and its receptor, Grindelwald. Eiger-Grindelwald signaling reduces levels of active Myosin in the germband ectodermal cortex through the localization of a Crumbs complex component, Patj (Pals-1-associated tight junction protein).

Rationally-engineered reproductive barriers using CRISPR & CRISPRa: an evaluation of the synthetic species concept in Drosophila melanogaster,30177778,10.1038/s41598-018-31433-2,"The ability to erect rationally-engineered reproductive barriers in animal or plant species promises to enable a number of biotechnological applications such as the creation of genetic firewalls, the containment of gene drives or novel population replacement and suppression strategies for genetic control. However, to date no experimental data exist that explores this concept in a multicellular organism. Here we examine the requirements for building artificial reproductive barriers in the metazoan model Drosophila melanogaster by combining CRISPR-based genome editing and transcriptional transactivation (CRISPRa) of the same loci. We directed 13 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to the promoters of 7 evolutionary conserved genes and used 11 drivers to conduct a misactivation screen. We identify dominant-lethal activators of the eve locus and find that they disrupt development by strongly activating eve outside its native spatio-temporal context. We employ the same set of sgRNAs to isolate, by genome editing, protective INDELs that render these loci resistant to transactivation without interfering with target gene function. When these sets of genetic components are combined we find that complete synthetic lethality, a prerequisite for most applications, is achievable using this approach. However, our results suggest a steep trade-off between the level and scope of dCas9 expression, the degree of genetic isolation achievable and the resulting impact on fly fitness. The genetic engineering strategy we present here allows the creation of single or multiple reproductive barriers and could be applied to other multicellular organisms such as disease vectors or transgenic organisms of economic importance.",2018,"Andrew J Waters, Paolo Capriotti, David C A Gaboriau, Philippos Aris Papathanos, Nikolai Windbichler, Andrew J Waters, Paolo Capriotti, David C A Gaboriau, Philippos Aris Papathanos, Nikolai Windbichler"
Ooplasmic flow cooperates with transport and anchorage in Drosophila oocyte posterior determination,30037924,10.1083/jcb.201709174,"The posterior determination of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo is defined by the posterior localization of oskar (osk) mRNA in the oocyte. Defects of its localization result in a lack of germ cells and failure of abdomen specification. A microtubule motor kinesin-1 is essential for osk mRNA posterior localization. Because kinesin-1 is required for two essential functions in the oocyte-transport along microtubules and cytoplasmic streaming-it is unclear how individual kinesin-1 activities contribute to the posterior determination. We examined Staufen, an RNA-binding protein that is colocalized with osk mRNA, as a proxy of posterior determination, and we used mutants that either inhibit kinesin-driven transport along microtubules or cytoplasmic streaming. We demonstrated that late-stage streaming is partially redundant with early-stage transport along microtubules for Staufen posterior localization. Additionally, an actin motor, myosin V, is required for the Staufen anchoring to the actin cortex. We propose a model whereby initial kinesin-driven transport, subsequent kinesin-driven streaming, and myosin V-based cortical retention cooperate in posterior determination.",2018,"Wen Lu, Margot Lakonishok, Anna S Serpinskaya, David KirchenbÃ¼echler, Shuo-Chien Ling, Vladimir I Gelfand, Wen Lu, Margot Lakonishok, Anna S Serpinskaya, David KirchenbÃ¼echler, Shuo-Chien Ling, Vladimir I Gelfand"
Sensorimotor pathway controlling stopping behavior during chemotaxis in the Drosophila melanogaster larva,30465650,10.7554/eLife.38740,"Sensory navigation results from coordinated transitions between distinct behavioral programs. During chemotaxis in the Drosophila melanogaster larva, the detection of positive odor gradients extends runs while negative gradients promote stops and turns. This algorithm represents a foundation for the control of sensory navigation across phyla. In the present work, we identified an olfactory descending neuron, PDM-DN, which plays a pivotal role in the organization of stops and turns in response to the detection of graded changes in odor concentrations. Artificial activation of this descending neuron induces deterministic stops followed by the initiation of turning maneuvers through head casts. Using electron microscopy, we reconstructed the main pathway that connects the PDM-DN neuron to the peripheral olfactory system and to the pre-motor circuit responsible for the actuation of forward peristalsis.

Thioester-Containing Proteins 2 and 4 Affect the Metabolic Activity and Inflammation Response in Drosophila,29463615,10.1128/IAI.00810-17,"Drosophila melanogaster is an outstanding model for studying host antipathogen defense. Although substantial progress has been made in understanding how metabolism and immunity are interrelated in flies, little information has been obtained on the molecular players that regulate metabolism and inflammation in Drosophila during pathogenic infection. Recently, we reported that the inactivation of thioester-containing protein 2 (Tep2) and Tep4 promotes survival and decreases the bacterial burden in flies upon infection with the virulent pathogens Photorhabdus luminescens and Photorhabdus asymbiotica Here, we investigated physiological and pathological defects in tep mutant flies in response to Photorhabdus challenge. We find that tep2 and tep4 loss-of-function mutant flies contain increased levels of carbohydrates and triglycerides in the presence or absence of Photorhabdus infection. We also report that Photorhabdus infection leads to higher levels of nitric oxide and reduced transcript levels of the apical caspase-encoding gene Dronc in tep2 and tep4 mutants. We show that Tep2 and Tep4 are upregulated mainly in the fat body rather than the gut in Photorhabdus-infected wild-type flies and that tep mutants contain decreased numbers of Photorhabdus bacteria in both tissue types. We propose that the inactivation of Tep2 or Tep4 in adult Drosophila flies results in lower levels of inflammation and increased energy reserves in response to Photorhabdus, which could confer a survival-protective effect during the initial hours of infection.",2018,"Upasana Shokal, Hannah Kopydlowski, Sneh Harsh, Ioannis Eleftherianos, Upasana Shokal, Hannah Kopydlowski, Sneh Harsh, Ioannis Eleftherianos"

Two discrete modes of histone gene expression during oogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,3928419,10.1016/0012-1606(85)90447-6,"We have used in situ hybridization to ovarian tissue sections to study the pattern of histone gene expression during oogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Our studies suggest that there are two distinct phases of histone gene expression during oogenesis. In the first phase, which occurs during early to middle oogenesis (stages 5-10A), we observe a mosaic pattern of histone mRNA in the 15 nurse cells of the egg chamber: some cells have very high levels of mRNA, while others have little or no mRNA. Our analysis suggests that there is a cyclic accumulation and subsequent degradation of histone mRNA in the egg chamber and that very little histone mRNA is transported into the growing oocyte. Moreover, since the endomitotic replication cycles of the nurse cells are asynchronous during this period, the mosaic distribution of histone message would suggest that the expression of the histone genes in each nurse cell nucleus is probably coupled to DNA replication as in most somatic cells. The second phase begins at stage 10B. During this period, histone gene expression appears to be ""induced"" in all 15 nurse cells of the egg chamber, and instead of a mosaic pattern, high levels of histone mRNA are found in all cells. Unlike the earlier phase, this expression is apparently uncoupled from the endomitotic replication of the nurse cells (which are completed by the end of stage 10A). Moreover, much of the newly synthesized histone mRNA is transported from the nurse cells into the oocyte where it accumulates and is stored for use during early embryogenesis. Finally, we have also observed tightly clustered grains within nurse cell nuclei in non-denatured tissue sections. As was the case with cytoplasmic histone mRNA, there is a mosaic distribution of nuclear grains from stages 5 to 10A, while at stage 10B, virtually all nurse cell nuclei have grain clusters. These grain clusters appear to be due to the hybridization of nurse cell histone gene DNA to our probe, and are localized in specific regions of the nucleus.",1985,"L Ambrosio, P Schedl, L Ambrosio, P Schedl"
Interaction of ribonuclease H from Drosophila melanogaster embryos with DNA polymerase-primase,2997223,,"An RNase H was purified 2,500-fold to near homogeneity from early embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. The purified enzyme has an approximate molecular weight of 180,000 and appears to consist of two 49,000- and two 39,000-dalton polypeptides. The enzyme specifically hydrolyzes RNA.DNA hybrids and releases oligoribonucleotides ranging in size from 2-9 residues. The RNase H can also remove RNA primers that are synthesized and subsequently elongated by the Drosophila polymerase-primase. Preincubation of the RNase H from D. melanogaster embryos with the homologous DNA polymerase-primase results in an increased rate of DNA synthesis. The DNA chains synthesized under these conditions are shorter than those synthesized in the absence of the RNase H, and the rate of primer synthesis is increased significantly. These findings suggest that the RNase H forms a complex with the polymerase-primase, increasing its recycling capacity and thereby increasing the frequency of chain initiation.",1985,"R A DiFrancesco, I R Lehman"
Sargassum fusiforme Fucoidan SP2 Extends the Lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster by Upregulating the Nrf2-Mediated Antioxidant Signaling Pathway,31485301,10.1155/2019/8918914,"Damage accumulated in the genome and macromolecules is largely attributed to increased oxidative damage and a lack of damage repair in a cell, and this can eventually trigger the process of aging. Alleviating the extent of oxidative damage is therefore considered as a potential way to promote longevity. SFPS, a heteropolysaccharide extracted from the brown alga Sargassum fusiforme, has previously been shown to alleviate oxidative damage during the aging process in mice, but whether SFPS could extend the lifespan of an organism was not demonstrated. Furthermore, the precise component within SFPS that is responsible for the antioxidant activity and the underlying mechanism of such activity was also not resolved. In this study, SP2, a fucoidan derived from SFPS, was shown to exhibit strong antioxidant activity as measured by in vitro radical-scavenging assays. SP2 also improved the survival rate of D. melanogaster subjected to oxidative stress. The flies that were fed with a diet containing SP2 from the time of eclosion displayed significant enhancement in lifespan and reduced accumulation of triglyceride at the old-age stage. In addition, SP2 markedly improved the activities of the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and reduced the contents of the malondialdehyde (MDA) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in old flies. Furthermore, SP2 also upregulated the expression levels of the nuclear factor-erythroid-2-like 2 (nfe2l2 or nrf2) and its downstream target genes, accompanied by a dramatic reduction in the expression of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (keap1, a canonical inhibitor of the Nrf2) in old flies. Additional support linking the crucial role of the Nrf2/ARE pathway to the antioxidant effect of SP2 was the relatively high survival rate under heat stress for D. melanogaster individuals receiving SP2 supplement, an effect that was abolished by the inclusion of inhibitors specific for the Nrf2/ARE pathway. Collectively, the results indicated that SP2, a S. fusiforme fucoidan, could promote longevity in D. melanogaster by enhancing the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant signaling pathway during the aging process.",2019,"Ya Zhang, Man Xu, Chenxi Hu, Amei Liu, Junjie Chen, Chenfei Gu, Xu Zhang, Cuiping You, Haibin Tong, Mingjiang Wu, Peichao Chen, Ya Zhang, Man Xu, Chenxi Hu, Amei Liu, Junjie Chen, Chenfei Gu, Xu Zhang, Cuiping You, Haibin Tong, Mingjiang Wu, Peichao Chen"

Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Excreted-Secreted Products Enable Infection by Photorhabdus luminescens Through Suppression of the Imd Pathway,31636642,10.3389/fimmu.2019.02372,"Upon entering the hemocoel of its insect host, the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora releases its symbiotic bacteria Photorhabdus luminescens, which is also a strong insect pathogen. P. luminescens is known to suppress the insect immune response independently following its release, but the nematode appears to enact its own immunosuppressive mechanisms during the earliest phases of an infection. H. bacteriophora was found to produce a unique set of excreted-secreted proteins in response to host hemolymph, and while basal secretions are immunogenic with regard to Diptericin expression through the Imd pathway, host-induced secretions suppress this expression to a level below that of controls in Drosophila melanogaster. This effect is consistent in adults, larvae, and isolated larval fat bodies, and the magnitude of suppression is dose-dependent. By reducing the expression of Diptericin, an antimicrobial peptide active against Gram-negative bacteria, the activated excreted-secreted products enable a more rapid propagation of P. luminescens that corresponds to more rapid host mortality. The identification and isolation of the specific proteins responsible for this suppression represents an exciting field of study with potential for enhancing the biocontrol of insect pests and treatment of diseases associated with excessive inflammation.",2019,"Eric Kenney, John M Hawdon, Damien O'Halloran, Ioannis Eleftherianos, Eric Kenney, John M Hawdon, Damien O'Halloran, Ioannis Eleftherianos"

Front-end Weber-Fechner gain control enhances the fidelity of combinatorial odor coding,31251174,10.7554/eLife.45293,"We showed previously (Gorur-Shandilya et al., 2017) that Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) expressing the co-receptor Orco scale their gain inversely with mean odor intensity according to Weber-Fechner's law. Here, we show that this front-end adaptation promotes the reconstruction of odor identity from dynamic odor signals, even in the presence of confounding background odors and rapid intensity fluctuations. These enhancements are further aided by known downstream transformations in the antennal lobe and mushroom body. Our results, which are applicable to various odor classification and reconstruction schemes, stem from the fact that this adaptation mechanism is not intrinsic to the identity of the receptor involved. Instead, a feedback mechanism adjusts receptor sensitivity based on the activity of the receptor-Orco complex, according to Weber-Fechner's law. Thus, a common scaling of the gain across Orco-expressing ORNs may be a key feature of ORN adaptation that helps preserve combinatorial odor codes in naturalistic landscapes.",2019,"Nirag Kadakia, Thierry Emonet, Nirag Kadakia, Thierry Emonet"

Tissue-specific genetic rescue and RNAi studies show that ADCK1 is necessary and sufficient in the trachea for larval viability. In addition, tracheal-rescued ADCK1 mutant adults have reduced lifespan, are developmentally delayed, have reduced body size, and normal levels of basic metabolites.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The larval lethality and double mouth hooks seen in ADCK1 mutants are often associated with reduced levels of the steroid hormone ecdysone, suggesting that this gene could contribute to controlling ecdysone levels or bioavailability. Similarly, the tracheal defects in these animals could arise from defects in intracellular lipid trafficking. These studies of ADCK1 provide a new context to define the physiological functions of this poorly understood member of the ADCK family of predicted mitochondrial proteins.",2019,"Dona R Wisidagama, Stefan M Thomas, Geanette Lam, Carl S Thummel, Dona R Wisidagama, Stefan M Thomas, Geanette Lam, Carl S Thummel"
Die in pieces: How Drosophila sheds light on neurite degeneration and clearance,31080046,10.1016/j.jgg.2019.03.010,"Dendrites and axons are delicate neuronal membrane extensions that undergo degeneration after physical injuries. In neurodegenerative diseases, they often degenerate prior to neuronal death. Understanding the mechanisms of neurite degeneration has been an intense focus of neurobiology research in the last two decades. As a result, many discoveries have been made in the molecular pathways that lead to neurite degeneration and the cell-cell interactions responsible for the subsequent clearance of neuronal debris. Drosophila melanogaster has served as a prime in vivo model system for identifying and characterizing the key molecular players in neurite degeneration, thanks to its genetic tractability and easy access to its nervous system. The knowledge learned in the fly provided targets and fuel for studies in other model systems that have further enhanced our understanding of neurodegeneration. In this review, we will introduce the experimental systems developed in Drosophila to investigate injury-induced neurite degeneration, and then discuss the biological pathways that drive degeneration. We will also cover what is known about the mechanisms of how phagocytes recognize and clear degenerating neurites, and how recent findings in this area enhance our understanding of neurodegenerative disease pathology.",2019,"Maria L Sapar, Chun Han, Maria L Sapar, Chun Han"

Ancestral hymenopteran queen pheromones do not share the broad phylogenetic repressive effects of honeybee queen mandibular pheromone,31669583,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2019.103968,"Queen pheromones effect the reproductive division of labour, a defining feature of eusociality. Reproductive division of labour ensures that one, or a small number of, females are responsible for the majority of reproduction within a colony. Much work on the evolution and function of these pheromones has focussed on Queen Mandibular Pheromone (QMP) which is produced by the Western or European honeybee (Apis mellifera). QMP has phylogenetically broad effects, repressing reproduction in a variety of arthropods, including those distantly related to the honeybee such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. QMP is highly derived and has little chemical similarity to the majority of hymenopteran queen pheromones which are derived from cuticular hydrocarbons. This raises the question of whether the phylogenetically widespread repression of reproduction by QMP also occurs with more basal saturated hydrocarbon-based queen-pheromones. Using D. melanogaster we show that saturated hydrocarbons are incapable of repressing reproduction, unlike QMP. We also show no interaction between the four saturated hydrocarbons tested or between the saturated hydrocarbons and QMP, implying that there is no conservation in the mechanism of detection or action between these compounds. We propose that the phylogenetically broad reproductive repression seen in response to QMP is not a feature of all queen pheromones, but unique to QMP itself, which has implications for our understanding of how queen pheromones act and evolve.",2019,"Mackenzie R Lovegrove, Peter K Dearden, Elizabeth J Duncan, Mackenzie R Lovegrove, Peter K Dearden, Elizabeth J Duncan"
Ferulic Acid Produced by Lactobacillus fermentum Influences Developmental Growth Through a dTOR-Mediated Mechanism,30368647,10.1007/s12033-018-0119-y,"The composition and activity of the gut microbiota impacts several energy-regulating conditions including diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome; however, the specific mechanisms linking the gut microbiota with the host's energy homeostasis remain elusive. Probiotics are health-promoting bacteria that when consumed, alter the composition and/or metabolism of resident microbiota conferring health benefits. To assess the role of a specific probiotic treatment on microbiota-derived impacts on energy homeostasis in the context of development, Drosophila melanogaster larvae were orally administered the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum NCIMB 5221 or its metabolic product, ferulic acid: a potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant hydroxycinnamic acid. In Drosophila larvae, both the probiotic and metabolite treatments advanced the nutritionally dependent stages of development in a dose-dependent manner while not affecting the hormonally controlled pupariation stage. These treatments correspondingly accelerated the developmental phase-dependent 20-hydroxyecdysone and insulin receptor gene expression surges and altered the phasic expression of downstream insulin signalling factors including dAkt, dTOR and dFOXO indicating a deep level of nutritionally dependent regulatory control. Administering Drosophila both ferulic acid and the TOR inhibitor rapamycin eliminated the physiological and molecular developmental advances indicating that microbial ferulic acid affects energy utilization in a dTOR-dependent manner outlining a potential mechanism of action of L. fermentum NCIMB 5221 on modulating microbiota dynamics to modulate energy homeostasis.

Loss-of-function mutations are responsible for a specific infantile or childhood-onset mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy with a chronic clinical course. Patients deficient in COA8 show specific COX deficiency with distinctive neuroimaging features, i.e., cavitating leukodystrophy. In human cells, COA8 is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, but oxidative stress stabilizes the protein, which is then involved in COX assembly, possibly by protecting the complex from oxidative damage. However, its precise function remains unknown. The CG14806 gene (dCOA8) is the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of human COA8 encoding a highly conserved COA8 protein. We report that dCOA8 knockdown (KD) flies show locomotor defects, and other signs of neurological impairment, reduced COX enzymatic activity, and reduced lifespan under oxidative stress conditions.

"Developmental expression of human tau in Drosophila melanogaster glial cells induces motor deficits and disrupts maintenance of PNS axonal integrity, without affecting synapse formation",31821364,10.1371/journal.pone.0226380,"Tauopathies are a class of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the abnormal phosphorylation and accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein, tau, in both neuronal and glial cells. Though tau pathology in glial cells is a prominent feature of many of these disorders, the pathological contribution of these lesions to tauopathy pathogenesis remains largely unknown. Moreover, while tau pathology is predominantly found in the central nervous system, a role for tau in the cells of the peripheral nervous system has been described, though not well characterized. To investigate the effects of glial tau expression on the development and maintenance of the peripheral nervous system, we utilized a Drosophila melanogaster model of tauopathy that expresses human wild-type tau in glial cells during development. We found that glial tau expression during development results in larval locomotor deficits and organismal lethality at the pupal stage, without affecting larval neuromuscular junction synapse development or post-synaptic amplitude. There was, however, a significant decrease in the decay time of synaptic potentials upon repeated stimulation of the motoneuron. Behavioral abnormalities were accompanied by glial cell death, disrupted maintenance of glial-axonal integrity, and the abnormal accumulation of the presynaptic protein, Bruchpilot, in peripheral nerve axons. Together, these data demonstrate that human tau expression in Drosophila glial cells does not affect neuromuscular junction synapse formation during development, but is deleterious to the maintenance of glial-axonal interactions in the peripheral nervous system.",2019,"Enrico M Scarpelli, Van Y Trinh, Zarrin Tashnim, Jacob L Krans, Lani C Keller, Kenneth J Colodner, Enrico M Scarpelli, Van Y Trinh, Zarrin Tashnim, Jacob L Krans, Lani C Keller, Kenneth J Colodner"
Insect hemolymph coagulation: Kinetics of classically and non-classically secreted clotting factors,30974174,10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.04.007,"In most insects, hemolymph coagulation, which is analogous to mammalian blood clotting, involves close collaboration between humoral and cellular components. To gain insights into the secretion of cellular clotting factors, we created tagged versions of three different clotting factors. Our focus was on factors which are released in a non-classical manner and to characterize them in comparison to a protein that is classically released, namely Glutactin (Glt). Transglutaminase-A (Tg) and Prophenoloxidase 2 (PPO2), both of which lack signal peptide sequences, have been previously demonstrated to be released from plasmatocytes and crystal cells (CCs) respectively, the two hemocyte classes in naÃ¯ve larvae. We found that at the molecular level, Tg secretion resembles the release of tissue transglutaminase in mammals. Specifically, Drosophila Tg is associated with vesicular membranes and remains membrane-bound after release, in contrast to Glt, which we found localizes to a different class of vesicles and is integrated into clot fibers. PPO2 on the other hand, is set free from CCs through cytolysis. We confirm that PPO2 is a central component of the cytosolic crystals and find that the distribution of PPO2 appears to vary across crystals and cells.

Chromosome Preference During Homologous Recombination Repair of DNA Double-Strand Breaks in Drosophila melanogaster,31519746,10.1534/g3.119.400607,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are especially toxic DNA lesions that, if left unrepaired, can lead to wide-ranging genomic instability. Of the pathways available to repair DSBs, the most accurate is homologous recombination (HR), where a homologous sequence is used as a donor template to restore genetic information at the break site. While much of the biochemical aspects of HR repair have been characterized, how the repair machinery locates and discriminates between potential homologous donor templates throughout the genome remains elusive. We use Drosophila melanogaster to investigate whether there is a preference between intrachromosomal and interhomolog donor sequences in mitotically dividing cells. Our results demonstrate that, although interhomolog HR is possible and frequent if another donor template is not available, intrachromosomal donor templates are highly preferred. This is true even if the interhomolog donor template is less diverged than the intrachromosomal donor template. Thus, despite the stringent requirements for homology, the chromosomal location of the donor template plays a more significant role in donor template choice.",2019,"Joel Fernandez, Hanan Bloomer, Natalia Kellam, Jeannine R LaRocque, Joel Fernandez, Hanan Bloomer, Natalia Kellam, Jeannine R LaRocque"

In Drosophila melanogaster, GSK3 is encoded by shaggy (sgg), which forms 17 annotated transcripts corresponding to 10 protein isoforms. Our goal was to demonstrate how differential sgg transcription affects lifespan, which GSK3 isoforms are important for the nervous system, and which changes in the nervous system accompany accelerated aging. Overexpression of three sgg transcripts affected the lifespan in a stage- and tissue-specific way: sgg-RA and sgg-RO affected the lifespan only when overexpressed in muscles and in embryos, respectively; the essential sgg-RB transcript affected lifespan when overexpressed in all tissues tested. In the nervous system, only sgg-RB overexpression affected lifespan, causing accelerated aging in a neuron-specific way, with the strongest effects in dopaminergic neurons and the weakest effects in GABAergic neurons. Pan-neuronal sgg-RB overexpression violated the properties of the nervous system, including the integrity of neuron bodies; the number, distribution, and structure of mitochondria; cytoskeletal characteristics; and synaptic activity. Such changes observed in young individuals indicated premature aging of their nervous system, which paralleled a decline in survival.

MEK inhibitor cobimetinib rescues a dRaf mutant lethal phenotype in Drosophila melanogaster,31338879,10.1111/exd.14010,"Since Drosophila melanogaster has proven to be a useful model system to study phenotypes of oncogenic mutations and to identify new anti-cancer drugs, we generated human BRAFV600E homologous dRaf mutant (dRafA572E ) Drosophila melanogaster strains to use these for characterisation of mutant phenotypes and exploit these phenotypes for drug testing. For mutant gene expression, the GAL4/UAS expression system was used. dRafA572E was expressed tissue-specific in the eye, epidermis, heart, wings, secretory glands and in the whole animal. Expression of dRaf A572E under the control of an eye-specific driver led to semi-lethality and a rough eye phenotype. The vast majority of other tissue-specific and ubiquitous drivers led to a lethal phenotype only. The rough eye phenotype was used to test BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and MEK1/2 inhibitor cobimetinib. There was no phenotype rescue by this treatment. However, a significant rescue of the lethal phenotype was observed under a gut-specific driver. Here, MEK1/2 inhibitor cobimetinib rescued Drosophila larvae to reach pupal stage in 37% of cases as compared to 1% in control experiments.

An assessment of the immune costs associated with meiotic drive elements in Drosophila,31530140,10.1098/rspb.2019.1534,"Most organisms are constantly adapting to pathogens and parasites that exploit their host for their own benefit. Less studied, but perhaps more ubiquitous, are intragenomic parasites or selfish genetic elements. These include transposable elements, selfish B chromosomes and meiotic drivers that promote their own replication without regard to fitness effects on hosts. Therefore, intragenomic parasites are also a constant evolutionary pressure on hosts. Gamete-killing meiotic drive elements are often associated with large chromosomal inversions that reduce recombination between the drive and wild-type chromosomes. This reduced recombination is thought to reduce the efficacy of selection on the drive chromosome and allow for the accumulation of deleterious mutations. We tested whether gamete-killing meiotic drive chromosomes were associated with reduced immune defence against two bacterial pathogens in three species of Drosophila. We found little evidence of reduced immune defence in lines with meiotic drive. One line carrying the Drosophila melanogaster autosomal Segregation Distorter did show reduced defence, but we were unable to attribute that reduced defence to either genotype or immune gene expression differences. Our results suggest that though gamete-killing meiotic drive chromosomes probably accumulate deleterious mutations, those mutations do not result in reduced capacity for immune defence.",2019,"Jenna Kay Lea, Robert L Unckless, Jenna Kay Lea, Robert L Unckless"

Larvae of blow flies (Phaenicia sericata) commonly used as therapy for debriding dead tissue, are exposed to high levels of bacterial endotoxins, but their mechanisms of LPS resistance are not entirely understood. Comparative effects of LPS on heart rate (HR) were examined for both Drosophila and blowfly larvae. Acute 10-min direct exposure of in situ heart tubes with saline containing 1, 100, and 500 Î¼g/ml LPS from two common bacterial stains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens) revealed a dose-dependent effect. The effects differed between the two fly models. Larval hearts of Drosophila stopped rapidly in low Ca2+ containing saline, but the hearts of blow flies appear unaffected for >30 min. S. marcescens increased HR initially in Drosophila followed by a reduction for low and high doses, but no change was observed in larvae of blow flies. Whereas P. aeruginosa at a high dose decreased HR in larvae of Drosophila but increased HR in larvae of blow flies.

Development and Analysis of a Quantitative Mathematical Model of Bistability in the Cross Repression System Between APT and SLBO Within the JAK/STAT Signaling Pathway,32848815,10.3389/fphys.2020.00803,"Cell migration is a key component in development, homeostasis, immune function, and pathology. It is important to understand the molecular activity that allows some cells to migrate. Drosophila melanogaster is a useful model system because its genes are largely conserved with humans and it is straightforward to study biologically. The well-conserved transcriptional regulator Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) promotes cell migration, but its signaling is modulated by downstream targets Apontic (APT) and Slow Border Cells (SLBO). Inhibition of STAT activity by APT and cross-repression of APT and SLBO determines whether an epithelial cell in the Drosophila egg chamber becomes motile or remains stationary. Through mathematical modeling and analysis, we examine how the interaction of STAT, APT, and SLBO creates bistability in the Janus Kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling pathway. In this paper, we update and analyze earlier models to represent mechanistically the processes of the JAK/STAT pathway. We utilize parameter, bifurcation, and phase portrait analyses, and make reductions to the system to produce a minimal three-variable quantitative model.

Treatment of third instar larvae of D. melanogaster with pyrazole, in contrast with 4-MP, produced an increase in the number of dorsocentral and scutellar macrochaetae and wing-notches in the adult fly. A large difference in the penetrance of terata in males and females was observed. Similar effects were observed in flies lacking ADH molecules. The teratogenicity of pyrazole must be due to disturbance of processes other than ADH inhibition.

We have cloned the hid gene and find that its expression is sufficient to induce PCD in cell death defective mutants. The hid gene appears to encode a novel 410-amino-acid protein, and its mRNA is expressed in regions of the embryo where cell death occurs. Ectopic expression of hid in the Drosophila retina results in eye ablation. This phenotype can be suppressed completely by expression of the anti-apoptotic p35 protein from baculovirus, indicating that p35 may act genetically downstream from hid.",1995,"M E Grether, J M Abrams, J Agapite, K White, H Steller, M E Grether, J M Abrams, J Agapite, K White, H Steller"
Vertical transmission of the retrotransposable elements R1 and R2 during the evolution of the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup,7713424,,"R1 and R2 are non-long-terminal repeat retrotransposable elements that insert into specific sequences of insect 28S ribosomal RNA genes. These elements have been extensively described in Drosophila melanogaster. To determine whether these elements have been horizontally or vertically transmitted, we characterized R1 and R2 elements from the seven other members of the melanogaster species subgroup by genomic blotting and nucleotide sequencing. Each species was found to have homogeneous families of R1 and R2 elements with the exception of erecta and orena, which have no R2 elements. The DNA sequences of multiple R1 and R2 copies from each species indicated nucleotide divergence within each species averaged only 0.48% for R1 and 0.35% for R2, well below the level of divergence among the species. Most copies of R1 and R2 (40 of 47) sequenced from the seven species were potentially functional, as indicated by the absence of premature termination codons or translational frameshifts that would destroy the open reading frame of the element. The sequence relationships of both the R1 and R2 elements from the various members of the melanogaster subgroup closely followed that of the species phylogeny, suggesting that R1 and R2 have been stably maintained by vertical transmission since the origin of this species subgroup 17-20 million years ago. The remarkable stability of R1 and R2, compared to what has been suggested for transposable elements that insert at multiple locations in these same species, may be due to their unique specificity for sites in the rRNA gene locus. Under low copy number conditions, when it is essential for any mobile element to transpose, the insertion specificities of R1 and R2 ensure uniform developmentally regulated target sites that can be occupied with little or no detrimental effect on the host.",1995,"D G Eickbush, T H Eickbush, D G Eickbush, T H Eickbush"
Haplotype test reveals departure from neutrality in a segment of the white gene of Drosophila melanogaster,8601488,,"Restriction map studies previously revealed extensive linkage disequilibria in the transcriptional unit of the white locus in natural Drosophila melanogaster populations. To understand the causes of these disequilibria, we sequenced a 4722-bp region of the white gene from 15 lines of D. melanogaster and 1 line of Drosophila simulans. Statistical tests applied to the entire 4722-bp region do not reject neutrality. In contrast, a test for high-frequency haplotypes (""Haplotype test"") revealed an 834-bp segment, encompassing the 3' end of intron 1 to the 3' end of intron 2, in which the structure of variation deviates significantly from the predictions of a neutral equilibrium model. The variants in this 834-bp segment segregate as single haplotype blocks. We proposed that these unusually large haplotype blocks are due to positive selection on polymorphisms within the white gene, including a replacement polymorphism, Arg-->Leu, within this segment.",1995,"D A Kirby, W Stephan"
Evidence for an inducible repair-recombination system in the female germ line of Drosophila melanogaster. I. Induction by inhibitors of nucleotide synthesis and by gamma rays,8647393,,"In the I-R system of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, the transposition frequency of I factor, a LINE element-like retrotransposon, is regulated by the reactivity level of the R mother. This reactivity is a cellular state maternally inherited but chromosomally determined, which has been shown to undergo heritable, cumulative and reversible changes with aging and some environmental conditions. We propose the hypothesis that this reactivity level is one manifestation of an inducible repair-recombination system whose biological role might be analogous to the SOS response in bacteria. In this paper, we show that inhibitors of DNA synthesis and gamma rays enhance the reactivity level in a very similar way. This enhancement is heritable, cumulative and reversible.",1995,"J C Bregliano, A LaurenÃ§on, F Degroote, J C Bregliano, A LaurenÃ§on, F Degroote"
Scutoid mutation of Drosophila melanogaster specifically decreases olfactory responses to short-chain acetate esters and ketones,8537826,10.1002/neu.480280208,"A molecular-genetic approach has been taken to identify genes involved in olfactory transduction in Drosophila melanogaster. Two independent lines of research led to the finding that the dominant Scutoid (Sco) mutation causes a diminished extracellular electroantennogram response to the odorants ethyl acetate (EtAC) and acetone (AC). Sco flies showed about 4- and 2.5-fold reduced responses to EtAC and AC, respectively, compared to Canton-S wild-type and sibling control flies lacking the Sco mutation when electroantennogram recordings were made from the proximal anterior third antennal segment. The responses to five other odors from three different chemical classes were unaltered. The maximum response to either EtAC or AC was decreased with no change in apparent affinity. Responses to short-chain (but not long-chain) acetate esters and ketones were dramatically affected at all antennal locations tested. Only in the proximal quadrants were responses to ethyl acetoacetate also reduced. Most Sco revertants tested had a normal olfactory response; duplications of the region including no-ocelli partially suppress the Sco bristle as well as olfactory phenotypes. Sco adults had an impaired behavioral response to EtAC but not to banana or propionate. There was no effect of the mutation on larval chemosensory behavior or extracellularly recorded adult compound eye and ocellar visual responses. These findings suggest the involvement of Sco in an olfactory pathway in adults which is specific for short-chain acetate esters and ketones.",1995,"A E Dubin, N L Heald, B Cleveland, J R Carlson, G L Harris, A E Dubin, N L Heald, B Cleveland, J R Carlson, G L Harris"

The orc2-1 mutation mapped to the region of greatest homology between the Drosophila and yeast proteins. The silent state mediated by DmOrc2 was epigenetic; it was propagated during mitotic divisions in a relatively stable way, whereas the nonsilent state was metastable.

Molecular analysis of a Drosophila melanogaster sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase allozyme variant that has cold labile activity,7633467,10.1016/0965-1748(95)00002-d,"A rare naturally occurring allele, GpdhACb62, at the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase locus in Drosophila melanogaster, encodes an enzyme with an electrophoretic mobility that is more cathodal than that produced by the common slow electrophoretic allele. After electrophoresis and staining of extracts of single adult flies there is a single band of activity corresponding in position to GPDH-1, but, using highly concentrated extracts, a faint band corresponding to GPDH-3 is observed. In GpdhACb62 homozygotes there is about 26% of the normal level of activity in adults, and less than 6% in third instar larvae. The reduction in activity is significantly greater than the decrease in GPDH immunologically cross-reacting material (CRM). Northern analyses, and rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE) of the 3' regions of the transcripts, show that the levels and structures of the poly(A)+RNAs are similar in homozygotes for GpdhACb62 and for a normal activity allele GpdhAC8. Hybridization to oligonucleotide probes specific for the GPDH-1 and GPDH-3 transcripts was of a similar intensity in GpdhACb62 and GpdhAC8 adult flies. In third instar larvae the main transcript is for GPDH-3 and again the hybridization signals were similar in each line. The activity of the enzyme produced by GpdhACb62 was unstable both at 50 degrees C and at 0 degrees C. The activity lost at 0 degrees C was recovered by incubation at 20 degrees C. The complete GpdhACb62 gene, and the partial Gpdh tandem duplication 3' to this gene, were cloned and sequenced. Comparisons with two normal activity GpdhF genes revealed 31 unique changes in the first copy of GpdhACb62. In exon 4, a T to G substitution changes cysteine to glycine and may disrupt a disulphide bond and be responsible for the distinctive properties of GPDH-ACb62.",1995,"J E Symonds, J B Gibson, A V Wilks, T M Wilanowski, J E Symonds, J B Gibson, A V Wilks, T M Wilanowski"
Structure and tissue-specific expression of the Drosophila melanogaster organellar-type Ca(2+)-ATPase gene,7575407,10.1042/bj3100757,"A 14 kb genomic clone covering the organellar-type Ca(2+)-ATPase gene of Drosophila melanogaster has been isolated and characterized. The sequence of a 7132 bp region extending from 1.1 kb 5' upstream of the initiation ATG codon over the polyadenylation signal at the 3' end has been determined. The gene consists of nine exons including one with an exceptional size of 2172 bp representing 72% of the protein coding region. Introns are relatively small (< 100 bp) except for the 3' intron which has a size of 2239 bp, an exceptionally large size among Drosophila introns. Five of the introns are in the same positions in Drosophila, Artemia and rabbit SERCA1 Ca(2+)-ATPase genes. There is only one organellar-type Ca(2+)-ATPase gene in the Drosophila genome, as was shown by Southern-blot analysis [VÃ¡radi, Gilmore-Hebert and Benz (1989) FEBS Lett. 258, 203-207] and by chromosomal localization [Magyar and VÃ¡radi (1990) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 173, 872-877]. Primer extension and S1-nuclease assays revealed a potential transcription initiation site 876 bp upstream of the translation initiation ATG with a TATA-box 23 bp upstream of this site. Analysis of the 5' region of the Drosophila organellar-type Ca(2+)-ATPase gene suggests the presence of potential recognition sequences of various muscle-specific transcription factors and shows a region with remarkable similarity to that in the rabbit SERCA2 gene. The tissue distribution of expression of the organellar-type Ca(2+)-ATPase gene has been studied by in situ RNA-RNA hybridization on microscopic sections. A low mRNA abundance can be detected in each tissue of adult flies, suggesting a housekeeping function for the gene. On the other hand a pronounced tissue specificity of expression has also been found as the organellar-type Ca(2+)-ATPase is expressed at a very high level in cell bodies of the central nervous system and in various muscles.",1995,"A Magyar, E Bakos, A VÃ¡radi, A Magyar, E Bakos, A VÃ¡radi"

This molecule, Acp26Aa, has structural features of a prohormone and contains a region with amino acid similarity to the egg-laying hormone of Aplysia. Acp26Aa is transferred to the female during mating, where it undergoes processing. Here we report the generation and analysis of mutants, including a null, in Acp26Aa. Females mated to male flies that lack Acp26Aa lay fewer eggs than do mates of normal males. This effect is apparent only on the first day after mating. The null mutation has no other detectable physiological or behavioral effects on the male or the mated female.",1995,"L A Herndon, M F Wolfner, L A Herndon, M F Wolfner"

Flies bearing at least two copies of the transgene display a severe rough eye phenotype characterized by missing secondary and tertiary pigment cells, a substantial reduction in the number of photoreceptor cells and a grossly abnormal morphology of the rhabdomeres. Cell fate determination in the imaginal disc occurs normally and abnormalities become manifest late in pupariation, coincident with the phase when the cells undergo major morphological changes.

Among a total of 14 mutations studied, no case of transposon mutagenesis was found. At least 4 mutations are associated with small deletions in the bw gene.

A female sterile embryonic lethal in the maternally haplo-insufficient 21 B8.C1-21 C8.D1 genomic region of Drosophila melanogaster,8984096,10.1111/j.1601-5223.1995.00121.x,Maternal hemizygosity of the 21 B8.C1-21 C8.D1 aristaless region of chromosome 2L of Drosophila melanogaster leads to high levels of embryonic mortality from the cross of Df(2L) al/+ females x +/+ males. The 21 B8.C1-21 C8.D1 polytene section therefore carries maternally active genes essential for embryogenesis. Selective screening for female sterile mutants against Df(2L) al yielded six alleles of a new female sterile embryonic lethal. This confirms the assumption that genomic regions that are maternally haplo-insufficient for normal embryogenesis house maternally active gene(s). It also demonstrates that mutational analysis of similar genomic regions can identify maternally acting embryonic lethal loci which escaped detection in spite of extensive screening experiments.,1995,"S Chandrashekaran, S Chandrashekaran"
The distribution of transposable elements on X chromosomes from a natural population of Drosophila simulans,8522157,10.1017/s0016672300034509,"The distribution of 13 transposable element families along 15 X chromosomes from an African natural population of Drosophila simulans was determined by in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes. The transposable elements cloned from Drosophila melanogaster all hybridized with Drosophila simulans chromosomes. The number of copies per family was 3.5 times lower in the latter species and correlated with the copy number per family in Drosophila melanogaster. With the exception of 297, the copy number per chromosome followed a Poisson distribution. Element frequencies per chromosome band were generally low. However, several sites of the distal region and the base of the X chromosome had high frequencies of occupation. Elements had higher abundance at the base of the chromosome compared to distal regions. Overall, the distribution of transposable elements in Drosophila simulans is similar to that found in Drosophila melanogaster. These data provide evidence for the operation of a force (or forces) opposing transpositional increase in copy number, and that this force is weaker at the bases of chromosomes, consistent with the idea that recombination between elements at non-homologous sites contains TE copy number. The reduction in copy number of all TE families in Drosophila simulans compared to Drosophila melanogaster can be explained by stronger selection against transposable element multiplication and/or lower rates of transposition in Drosophila simulans.",1995,"S V Nuzhdin, S V Nuzhdin"
Characterization of an EcR/USP heterodimer target site that mediates ecdysone responsiveness of the Drosophila Lsp-2 gene,8544820,10.1007/BF00290580,"The Larval serum protein-2 gene (Lsp-2) of Drosophila melanogaster is uniquely expressed in the fat body tissue from the beginning of the third instar to the end of adult life. Accumulation of the larval Lsp-2 transcript is enhanced by 20-hydroxyecdysone. To study the molecular basis for ecdysone regulated Lsp-2 activity, deletion mutants of the Lsp-2 5'-flanking region were constructed by fusion to either the Escherichia coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene or to an hsp70-lacZ hybrid gene encoding beta-galactosidase. Constructs transfected into Drosophila S2/M3 cells were shown to confer transient ecdysone inducibility on the reporter genes. A single functional ecdysone response element (EcRE) was localized at position -75 relative to the Lsp-2 transcription initiation site. In gel mobility shift assays using fat body nuclear extracts or nuclear receptors synthesized in vitro, a 27-bp sequence harboring the EcRE bound both the Drosophila ecdysone receptor and the Drosophila retinoid-X homologue, Ultraspiracle, in a cooperative manner. Competition experiments indicate that the affinity of the Lsp-2 EcRE for the ecdysone receptor complex is comparable to that of the canonical EcRE of the hsp27 gene and is at least 4-fold greater than that of Fbp1, another fat body-specific Drosophila gene. Our results suggest that structural features of this EcRE determine its ability to induce ecdysone responsiveness at a lower ligand concentration and may form the basis for differential hormone responsiveness within the fat body.",1995,"C Antoniewski, M S O'Grady, R G Edmondson, S M Lassieur, H Benes, C Antoniewski, M S O'Grady, R G Edmondson, S M Lassieur, H Benes"
Male and female cooperate in the prohormone-like processing of a Drosophila melanogaster seminal fluid protein,7556947,10.1006/dbio.1995.1315,"Acp26Aa is a Drosophila seminal fluid protein that plays a role in the elevation of egg-laying by the mated female and has structural features of a prohormone.

Acp26Aa is processed in the mated female's genital tract. We show here that the processing involves sequential proteolytic cleavages, and we map the position of these cleavages. Although Acp26Aa is not cleaved in the male, its processing in the mated female requires activities donated by the male. Acp26Aa ectopically expressed in unmated females is not processed. Processing of Acp26Aa in wild-type females mated to males with altered seminal fluid is dependent on the presence and amount of male accessory gland secretions.

To understand the basis of this unequal puffing, the levels of hsp70 and alpha-beta transcripts at the 87A and 87C heat shock loci in polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster were quantified in situ by hybridization of antisense RNA probes after treatment with heat shock, benzamide, colchicine, heat shock followed by benzamide or heat shock in the presence of colchicine in salivary glands of late third instar larvae. Heat shock, resulting in equal puffing of the 87A and 87C loci, increased the hsp70 transcripts at both sites in proportion to the numbers of hsp70 gene copies at the two loci; levels of alpha-beta transcripts were also elevated at the 87C site following heat shock. Heat shock followed by benzamide treatment, which results in a larger puff at 87A, caused an increase in hsp70 transcripts per gene copy at 87A and a decrease at 87C without any effect on the alpha-beta transcripts; heat shock in the presence of colchicine, which causes the 87C puff to be larger than 87A, resulted in a decrease in hsp70 RNA at 87A but an increase in the levels of hsp70 as well as alpha-beta transcripts at the 87C site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1995,"A Sharma, S C Lakhotia, A Sharma, S C Lakhotia"
Conservation of brown gene trans-inactivation in Drosophila,7635284,,"The mechanism underlying trans-inactivation associated with dominant position effect variegation (PEV) of the Drosophila melanogaster brown gene has been addressed by a comparison with its D. virilis homologue.

An extended region of sequence similarity upstream of the open reading frame is observed. As the D. virilis homologue is functionally interchangeable with the D. melanogaster gene, these genes must share regulatory sequences as well as protein coding homology.

Presynaptic proteins involved in exocytosis in Drosophila melanogaster: a genetic analysis,9372128,10.1007/BF02331827,"Neuronal communication involves the fusion of neurotransmitter filled synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic terminal. This exocytotic event depends upon proteins present in three separate compartments: the synaptic vesicle, the synaptic cytosol, and the presynaptic membrane. Recent data indicate that the basic components of exocytotic pathways, including those used for neurotransmitter release, are conserved from yeast to human. Genetic dissection of the secretory pathway in yeast, identification of the target proteins cleaved by the clostridial neurotoxins and biochemical characterization of the interactions of synaptic proteins from vertebrates have converged to provide the SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein receptor) hypothesis for vesicle trafficking. This model proposes that proteins present in the vesicle (v-SNAREs) interact with membrane receptors (t-SNAREs) to provide a molecular scaffold for cytosolic proteins involved in fusion. The hypothesis that these mechanisms function at the synapse relies largely upon in vitro evidence. Recently, genetic approaches in mice, C. elegans and the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, have been used to dissect the in vivo function of numerous proteins involved in synaptic transmission. This review covers recent progress and insights provided by a genetic dissection of neurotransmitter release in Drosophila. In addition, we will provide evidence that the mechanisms for synaptic communication are highly conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates, making Drosophila an ideal model system to further unravel the intricacies of synaptic transmission.",1995,"J T Littleton, H J Bellen, J T Littleton, H J Bellen"

In the wing somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) (3) TA was found to be toxic for larvae of the high bioactivation cross and produced a weak positive response.

Immunocytochemical localization of Diploptera punctata allatostatin-like peptide in Drosophila melanogaster,8847412,10.1002/cne.903630310,"Allatostatins isolated from the cockroach Diploptera punctata are a family of neuropeptides that inhibit juvenile hormone synthesis in cockroaches and related insects but not in flies. In cockroaches, these widely distributed peptides have been shown to have other functions. This report provides evidence for the presence of allatostatin-like peptides in Drosophila melanogaster by demonstration of allatostatic activity of extracts of central nervous system from larvae and adults on corpora allata of Diploptera and by immunocytochemical localization of peptides in Drosophila with monoclonal antibody against Diploptera allatostatin I. Extract of adult central nervous system showed four times more allatostatic activity than that of the larva or twice the activity per unit volume of central nervous system. This is reflected in an increase in number and arborization of immunoreactive neurons in the adult. The immunoreactive neurons in the central nervous system appear to be interneurons, with the exception of motoneurons in the last abdominal neuromere that project to muscles of the hindgut, a pair of peripheral cells in each of two thoracic segments in the larva and on nerves to wings and halteres in the adult, and endocrine cells of the midgut epithelium. Nerves to the corpus allatum were not immunoreactive. The presence of Diploptera allatostatin-like peptides in interneurons and motoneurons, in the neurohemal networks, and in endocrine cells of the midgut and their absence in nerves to the corpus allatum in Drosophila suggests that these peptides may function as neuromodulators, myomodulators, and neurohormones and not as regulators of the corpus allatum.",1995,"J G Yoon, B Stay, J G Yoon, B Stay"
Genetic dissection of the molecular mechanisms of transmitter vesicle release during synaptic transmission,8520572,10.1016/0928-4257(96)80552-3,"Over the last few years there has been rapid progress in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of synaptic transmission. This advance is largely due to the convergence of biochemical and genetic approaches to identify a discrete set of synaptic proteins associated with transmitter vesicles and their specialized fusion sites in the presynaptic membrane. The fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, is an attractive system to further such studies where we can combine sophisticated molecular genetic manipulations with direct observation of synaptic phenotypes at the well-characterized neuromuscular junction (NMJ). So far, five essential synaptic proteins have been identified in Drosophila and genetically modified or removed from the synapse: synaptotagmin, synaptobrevin (also called VAMP), syntaxin, Rop (Drosophila n-sec1 homologue) and cysteine string protein (csp). We are presently characterizing the functional roles of these identified proteins using electrophysiological and ultrastructural analyses of genetic mutants. In this article I review our current knowledge of these five proteins in Drosophila and discuss their possible functional roles in the molecular machinery governing synaptic transmission.",1995,"K S Broadie, K S Broadie"
A family of dynein genes in Drosophila melanogaster,8186464,10.1091/mbc.5.1.45,"We report the identification and initial characterization of seven Drosophila dynein heavy chain genes. Each gene is single copy and maps to a unique genomic location. Sequence analysis of partial clones reveals that each encodes a highly conserved portion of the putative dynein hydrolytic ATP-binding site in dyneins that includes a consensus phosphate-binding (P-loop) motif. One of the clones is derived from a Drosophila cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain gene, Dhc64C, that shows extensive amino acid identity to cytoplasmic dynein isoforms from other organisms. Two other Drosophila dynein clones are 85 and 90% identical at the amino acid level to the corresponding region of the beta heavy chain of sea urchin axonemal dynein. Probes for all seven of the dynein-related sequences hybridize to transcripts that are of the appropriate size, approximately 14 kilobases, to encode the characteristic high molecular weight dynein heavy chain polypeptides. The Dhc64C transcript is readily detected in RNA from ovaries, embryos, and testes. Transcripts from five of the six remaining genes are also detected in much lesser amounts in tissues other than testes. All but one of the dynein transcripts are expressed at comparable levels in testes suggesting their participation in flagellar axoneme assembly and motility.",1994,"K Rasmusson, M Serr, J Gepner, I Gibbons, T S Hays, K Rasmusson, M Serr, J Gepner, I Gibbons, T S Hays"
The motor neurons innervating the direct flight muscles of Drosophila melanogaster are morphologically specialized,8188860,10.1002/cne.903400311,"The anatomy of the motor neurons innervating six direct flight muscles in Drosophila melanogaster has been investigated by using a horseradish peroxidase backfilling technique. The somata of these motor neurons are arranged in two distinct clusters ipsilateral to the muscle they innervate. One cluster of cell bodies is located in the ventrolateral region between the prothoracic neuromere and the mesothoracic leg-related neuropil and the other is situated dorsally and posteriorly to the mesothoracic leg-related neuropil. Axons from somata in the ventrolateral cluster run in the anterior dorsal mesothoracic nerve, while axons from somata in the other cluster run in the mesothoracic accessory nerve. This distribution of somata and axons is discussed in the light of the morphological similarity and proximity of these functionally related muscles. On the basis of the branching patterns of their neurites, direct flight muscle motor neurons can be classified as stubbly, fibrous or tufted. The terminal arborizations of the motor neurons over the direct flight muscles are also morphologically specialized. Both the central and the peripheral morphological specializations of the direct flight muscle motor neurons correlate with the activity patterns exhibited by their associated muscles during flight and courtship song.",1994,"J R Trimarchi, A M Schneiderman, J R Trimarchi, A M Schneiderman"
Genetics of a nonoptimal behavior: oviposition preference of Drosophila mauritiana for a toxic resource,7993320,10.1007/BF01076179,"Among three sibling species of the D. melanogaster subgroup, two are generalists (D. simulans and D. mauritiana), while the third, D. sechellia, specializes on a single toxic resource, the fruit of Morinda citrifolia. D. sechellia, resistant to the toxics, prefers to oviposit on morinda; D. simulans, which is very sensitive, is strongly repelled. D. mauritiana exhibits an aberrant behavior since it prefers to lay its eggs on morinda, where its embryos are killed. Oviposition behavior, studied in parental species, F1 hybrids, and backcrosses, was mostly an additive genetical trait. Further investigations were made with D. mauritiana and D. simulans carrying recessive markers. The X and second chromosomes had no effect, while a clear effect was found for chromosome 3. Since the toxicity of morinda is due to middle-length fatty acids, the behavior of the three species toward various acids was investigated. We found that D. sechellia exhibited a general oviposition preference for acids, while D. simulans was repelled by acids with at least four carbons. Surprisingly D. mauritiana exhibited behavior quite similar to that of D. simulans. Preference for morinda in D. sechellia and D. mauritiana could be mediated by different chemicals.",1994,"B Moreteau, S R'Kha, J R David, B Moreteau, S R'Kha, J R David"

USING HITCHHIKING GENES TO STUDY ADAPTATION AND DIVERGENCE DURING SPECIATION WITHIN THE DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER SPECIES COMPLEX,28565154,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1994.tb02222.x,"Several studies of intraspecific and interspecific DNA sequence variation from Drosophila loci have revealed a pattern of low intraspecific variation from genomic regions of low recombination. The mechanisms consistently invoked to explain these patterns are the selective sweep of advantageous mutations together with genetic hitchhiking of linked loci. To examine the effect of selective sweeps on genetic divergence during speciation, we studied two loci in different genomic regions thought to be subject to selective sweeps. We obtained DNA sequences from 1.1kb pair portions of the fourth chromosome locus cubitus interruptus Dominant (ciD ) and from the asense locus near the telomere of the X chromosome. At ciD , we found very low variation among multiple lines of Drosophila mauritiana and D. sechellia. This finding is consistent with an earlier report of very low variation in D. melanogaster and D. simulans at ciD and supports the conclusion of selective sweeps and genetic hitchhiking on the nonrecombining fourth chromosome. The pattern of variation found at asense suggests that a selective sweep has occurred recently at the tip of the X chromosome in D. simulans, but not in D. melanogaster or D. mauritiana. The data from ciD and asense are compared with data from three X chromosome loci (period, zeste, and yolk protein 2) that experience normal levels of recombination. By examining estimated genealogies and the rates at which different classes of mutations have accumulated, we conclude that selective sweeps are common occurrences on the fourth chromosome but less common near the tip of the X chromosome. An interesting pattern of low variation at ciD among D. simulans, D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia suggests that a selective sweep may have occurred among these forms even after divergence into separate species had begun.",1994,"Holly Hilton, Richard M Kliman, Jody Hey, Holly Hilton, Richard M Kliman, Jody Hey"
Two distinct transmembrane serine/threonine kinases from Drosophila melanogaster form an activin receptor complex,8289834,10.1128/mcb.14.2.944,"A transmembrane protein serine/threonine kinase, Atr-I, that is structurally related to receptors for members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family has been cloned from Drosophila melanogaster. The spacing of extracellular cysteines and the cytoplasmic domain of Atr-I resemble most closely those of the recently described mammalian type I receptors for TGF-beta and activin. When expressed alone in test cells, Atr-I is unable to bind TGF-beta, activin, or bone morphogenetic protein 2. However, Atr-I binds activin efficiently when coexpressed with the distantly related Drosophila activin receptor Atr-II, with which it forms a heteromeric complex. Atr-I can also bind activin in concert with mammalian activin type II receptors. Two alternative forms of Atr-I have been identified that differ in an ectodomain region encompassing the cysteine box motif characteristic of receptors in this family. Comparison of Atr-I with other type I receptors reveals the presence of a characteristic 30-amino-acid domain immediately upstream of the kinase region in all these receptors. This domain, of unknown function, contains a repeated Gly-Ser sequence and is therefore referred to as the GS domain. Maternal Atr-I transcripts are abundant in the oocyte and widespread during embryo development and in the imaginal discs of the larva. The structural properties, binding specificity, and dependence on type II receptors define Atr-I as an activin type I receptor from D. melanogaster. These results indicate that the heteromeric kinase structure is a general feature of this receptor family.",1994,"J L Wrana, H Tran, L Attisano, K Arora, S R Childs, J MassaguÃ©, M B O'Connor, J L Wrana, H Tran, L Attisano, K Arora, S R Childs, J MassaguÃ©, M B O'Connor"

Progeny were analyzed for loss of the ring-X. The results of this in vivo study showed that TA had no suppressing effect on chromosome loss occurring spontaneously or after induction by MMS in mature spermatozoa. In contrast, TA caused a significant increase in the frequency of MMC-induced ring-X loss. The increase caused by this co-mutagenic effect reached values of 34, 33 and 40% at TA concentrations of 10, 25 and 50 mM, respectively. These increments may reflect the action of TA on a uvrABC-type enzyme which, by increasing the double-strand breaks (DSBs), somehow interferes with the post-replicational repair responsible for the final DSB correction.",1994,"K S Cunha, M L Reguly, M C Gimmler-Luz, J H Santos, M Lehmann, H H de Andrade, K S Cunha, M L Reguly, M C Gimmler-Luz, J H Santos, M Lehmann, H H de Andrade"
"Cell cycle analysis and chromosomal localization of human Plk1, a putative homologue of the mitotic kinases Drosophila polo and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc5",7962193,,"polo and CDC5 are two genes required for passage through mitosis in Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively. Both genes encode structurally related protein kinases that have been implicated in regulating the function of the mitotic spindle. Here, we report the characterization of a human protein kinase that displays extensive sequence similarity to Drosophila polo and S. cerevisiae Cdc5; we refer to this kinase as Plk1 (for polo-like kinase 1). The largest open reading frame of the Plk1 cDNA encodes a protein of 68,254 daltons, and a protein of this size is detected by immunoblotting of HeLa cell extracts with monoclonal antibodies raised against the C-terminal part of Plk1 expressed in Escherichia coli. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from human cells and mouse tissues shows that a single Plk1 mRNA of 2.3 kb is highly expressed in tissues with a high mitotic index, consistent with a possible function of Plk1 in cell proliferation. The Plk1 gene maps to position p12 on chromosome 16, a locus for which no associations with neoplastic malignancies are known. The Plk1 protein levels and its distribution change during the cell cycle, in a manner consistent with a role of Plk1 in mitosis.

Inducibility of various cytochrome P450 isozymes by phenobarbital and some other xenobiotics in Drosophila melanogaster,8204104,10.1016/0006-2952(94)90317-4,"The inducibility of cytochrome P450 isozymes has been investigated in the Drosophila melanogaster insecticide susceptible (Oregon R) and insecticide resistant (91R) strains. Both the level and induction kinetics of 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase activity were stimulated by phenobarbital (PB) to a lower extent than that of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase in the Oregon R strain. The basal level of the cytochrome P450-linked activities in insecticide resistant flies was higher than that noted in susceptible ones. However, treatment with PB has increased levels of 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activities more in susceptible flies than in resistant ones. In contrast to PB, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benzo[a]pyrene induced both activities in 91R flies to a greater extent than in Oregon R ones. The potent PB-like inducer in mice but not in rats 1.4-bis[2-(dichloropyridyloxy)]-benzene failed to induce the cytochrome P450 system in D. melanogaster, when triphenyldioxane (PB-like inducer in rats but not in mice) markedly affected this system in a PB-like manner. The SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting analysis using monoclonal antibodies 13-2e and 8-1d have shown that the level of the 56,000 and 54,000 Da insecticide resistance-related forms has increased in the susceptible strain by PB and some other PB like inducers.

Developmental specificity of a bidirectional moth chorion promoter in transgenic Drosophila,8293884,10.1006/dbio.1994.1005,"The developmentally specific activity of the 326-bp promoter that is shared by the paired 18 and 401 chorion genes of the silkmoth Antheraea pernyi was studied in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster. Bidirectional activity of this promoter is demonstrated in a novel dual reporter vector, containing lacZ on one side and CAT on the other. The single chorion-specific hexamer of this promoter, TCACGT, is essential for expression in both orientations; even single-base substitutions (at positions 2 or 4 of the hexamer) suppress expression. With both reporter genes, ovarian expression is greater from the 401 side of the promoter, although the difference between the two sides is greater for the CAT gene. The intact promoter fragment (which includes some 5' untranslated sequences) is expressed with a high degree of tissue specificity, but a central 184-bp fragment derived from it is also active ectopically in parts of the internal male genitalia.

Germ-line expression of a functional LINE from Drosophila melanogaster: fine characterization allows for potential investigations of trans-regulators,8074994,,"The I factor (IF) is a functional non-viral retrotransposon, or LINE, from Drosophila melanogaster.

Gen. 240: 277-285, 1993) we used a transgenic fusion between the 5' part of the IF and the lacZ gene to characterize IF expression and its regulation. This I-lacZ transgenic fusion expresses beta-galactosidase activity during oogenesis. We established a Drosophila line bearing four transgenic insertions (the 4I-lacZ line) and got new insights about IF expression: (1) I-lacZ expression is proportional to the copy number of transgenes present in the genome, (2) the expression occurs just before or when meiosis begins, (3) this expression seems to be subjected to a variegation effect within the germ-line cells, (4) the transgenic activity is mainly directed toward the decondensed chromatin of nurse cells. The close relationship between I factor expression and oogenesis led us to investigate the role played by genes expressed during oogenesis on I factor expression.

Redundant cis-acting elements control expression of the Drosophila affinidisjuncta Adh gene in the larval fat body,8165141,10.1093/nar/22.7.1257,"The alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene in the Hawaiian species of fruit fly, Drosophila affinidisjuncta, like the Adh genes from all Drosophila species analyzed, is expressed at high levels in the larval fat body via a larval-specific promoter. To identify the cis-acting elements involved in this highly conserved aspect of Adh gene expression, deleted D. affinidisjuncta genes were introduced into D. melanogaster by somatic transformation. Unlike previously described methods, this transformation system allows analysis of Adh gene expression specifically in the larval fat body. The arrangement of sequences influencing expression of the proximal promoter of this gene in the larval fat body differs markedly from that described for the Adh gene from the distant relative, D. melanogaster. Multiple redundant elements dispersed 5' and 3' to the gene, only some of which map to regions carrying evolutionarily conserved sequences, affect expression in the fat body. D. affinidisjuncta employs a novel mode of Adh gene regulation in which the proximal promoter is influenced by sequences having roles in expression of the distal promoter. This gene is also unique in that far upstream sequences can compensate for loss of sequences within 200 bp of the proximal RNA start site. Furthermore, expression is influenced in an unusual, context-dependent manner by a naturally-occurring 3' duplication of the proximal promoter--a feature found only in Hawaiian species.",1994,"R W McKenzie, J Hu, M D Brennan, R W McKenzie, J Hu, M D Brennan"

Although this gene is experiencing a higher rate of synonymous substitution than Adh, it is more constrained at the amino acid level.

The Om(2D) RNA is not detected in wild-type eye imaginal discs, but is abundantly found in the center of the eye discs of Om(2D) mutants, where excessive cell death occurs. D. melanogaster flies transformed with the Om(2D) cDNA under control of the hsp70 promoter display abnormal eye morphology when heat-shocked at the third larval instar stage. These results suggest that the Om(2D) gene is not normally expressed in the eye imaginal discs, but its ectopic expression, induced by the tom element, in the eye disc of third instar larvae results in defects in adult eye morphology.",1994,"K Yoshida, N Juni, T Awasaki, Y Tsuriya, N Shaya, S H Hori, K Yoshida, N Juni, T Awasaki, Y Tsuriya, N Shaya, S H Hori"
Phenotypic rescue by a bovine transgene in a Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-null mutant of Drosophila melanogaster,8289809,10.1128/mcb.14.2.1302,"Null mutants for Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) in Drosophila melanogaster are male sterile, have a greatly reduced adult life span, and are hypersensitive to paraquat. We have introduced a synthetic bovine CuZnSOD transgene under the transcriptional control of the D. melanogaster 5C actin promoter into a CuZnSOD-null mutant of D. melanogaster. This was carried out by P-element-mediated transformation of the Drosophila-bovine CuZnSOD transgene into a CuZnSOD+ recipient strain followed by genetic crossing of the transgene into a strain carrying the CuZnSOD-null mutation, cSODn108. The resulting transformants express bovine CuZnSOD exclusively to about 30% of normal Drosophila CuZnSOD levels. Expression of the Drosophila-bovine CuZnSOD transgene in the CuZnSOD-null mutant rescues male fertility and resistance to paraquat to apparently normal levels. However, adult life span is restored to only 30% of normal, and resistance to hyperoxia is 90% of that found in control flies. This striking differential restoration of pleiotropic phenotypes could be the result of a threshhold of CuZnSOD expression necessary for normal male fertility and resistance to the toxicity of paraquat or hyperoxia which is lower than the threshold required to sustain a normal adult life span. Alternatively, the differential rescue of fertility, resistance to active oxygen, and life span might indicate different cell-specific transcriptional requirements for these functions which are normally provided by the control elements of the native CuZnSOD gene but are only partly compensated for by the transcriptional control elements of the actin 5C promoter.",1994,"I Reveillaud, J Phillips, B Duyf, A Hilliker, A Kongpachith, J E Fleming"

Lycopene also exhibits antimutagenic effect resulting in increased survival of Drosophila melanogaster chrysalis under exposure to 40 Gy gamma-radiation.,1994,"A B Kapitanov, A M Pimenov, L K Obukhova, D M IzmaÄ­lov, A B Kapitanov, A M Pimenov, L K Obukhova, D M IzmaÄ­lov"
Characterization of a Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-encoding gene region in Drosophila willistoni,7926818,10.1016/0378-1119(94)90085-x,"A Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-encoding gene (Sod) from Drosophila willistoni was cloned and sequenced. The gene shows a typical structure for a fruit-fly Sod gene, with a coding region of 462 bp in two exons separated by a 417-bp intron. Comparison of the Sod sequences from D. willistoni and D. melanogaster suggests that these species are only remotely related. Downstream from the Sod gene, there is an ORF on the opposite strand that putatively encodes the last exon of an unidentified gene. The polyadenylation signals of the two genes are separated by only 61 bp in D. willistoni, conforming to the common picture of compact dipteran genomes.",1994,"J Kwiatowski, A Latorre, D Skarecky, F J Ayala, J Kwiatowski, A Latorre, D Skarecky, F J Ayala"
Screen for enhancers of Polycomb and Polycomblike in Drosophila melanogaster,7955568,10.1002/dvg.1020150505,"There are 11 Polycomb group genes known in Drosophila. These genes are negative regulators of homeotic gene expression, and may act by modifying chromatin structure. It is not clear how many members of the Polycomb group of genes exist. Many were discovered because of their homeotic phenotypes, or because they enhance homeotic mutations. Systematic screens for enhancers of Polycomb have identified previously known members of the Polycomb group. In an attempt to discover cytological locations of new Polycomb group genes, we crossed deletions uncovering about 20% of the genome to Polycomb-like and Polycomb and scored for enhancement of the extra sex combs phenotype. Haploidy for four regions, 36F7-37A, 43E18; 44B5-9, 70C2-6, and 70C6-15; 70D enhanced the extra sex comb phenotype associated with strong Polycomb group mutations. These regions have homeotic phenotypes either as homozygous embryos or heterozygous adults, or both. We also show that spalt enhances Polycomb group mutations. These results are discussed with respect to previous estimates of Polycomb group gene number.",1994,"H L Landecker, D A Sinclair, H W Brock, H L Landecker, D A Sinclair, H W Brock"
Sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster: X-linked genes involved in the initial step of sex-lethal activation,8062457,10.1002/dvg.1020150307,"Sex determination is the commitment of an embryo to either the female or the male developmental pathway. The ratio of X chromosomes to sets of autosomes is the primary genetic signal that determines sex in Drosophila, by triggering the functional state of the gene Sex-lethal: in females (2X;2A) Sxl will be ON, whereas in males (X;2A) Sxl will be OFF. Genetic and molecular studies have defined a set of genes involved in the formation of the X:A signal, as well as other genes, with either maternal or zygotic effects, which are also involved in regulating the initial step of Sex-lethal activation. We review these data and present new data on two more regions of the X chromosome that define other genes needed for Sxl activation. In addition, we report on the interaction between some of the genes regulating Sxl activation.",1994,"L SÃ¡nchez, B Granadino, M Torres, L SÃ¡nchez, B Granadino, M Torres"
Dosage compensation of the period gene in Drosophila melanogaster,7851769,,"The period (per) gene is located on the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster. Its expression influences biological clocks in this fruit fly, including the one that subserves circadian rhythms of locomotor activity. Like most X-linked genes in Drosophila, per is under the regulatory control of gene dosage compensation. In this study, we assessed the activity of altered or augmented per+ DNA fragments in transformants. Relative expression levels in male and female adults were inferred from periodicities associated with locomotor behavioral rhythms, and by histochemically assessing beta-galactosidase levels in transgenics carrying different kinds of per-lacZ fusion genes. The results suggest that per contains multipartite regulatory information for dosage compensation within the large first intron and also within the 3' half of this genetic locus.",1994,"M K Cooper, M J Hamblen-Coyle, X Liu, J E Rutila, J C Hall, M K Cooper, M J Hamblen-Coyle, X Liu, J E Rutila, J C Hall"
The SH2-like Akt homology (AH) domain of c-akt is present in multiple copies in the genome of vertebrate and invertebrate eucaryotes. Cloning and characterization of the Drosophila melanogaster c-akt homolog Dakt1,8302573,,"The Akt proto-oncogene encodes a serine-threonine protein kinase whose carboxyterminal catalytic domain is closely related to the catalytic domains of all the known members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family. Akt, however, differs from PKC in its N-terminal region which contains a domain related distantly to the SH2 domain of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases and other signalling proteins, which we have named Akt homology (AH) domain. Low stringency hybridization of a c-akt AH probe to a panel of genomic DNAs from vertebrate and invertebrate eucaryotes detected multiple DNA bands (perhaps multiple genes) in all tested species. Drosophila DNA contains at least three hybridizing DNA bands. One of them was cloned, and found by sequence analysis, to define an Akt related gene (Dakt1). Comparison between the coding regions of c-akt and Dakt1 revealed 64.6% identity at the nucleotide level and 76.5% similarity at the amino acid level. The highest degree of homology was detected in the AH domain (68.3% similarity at the amino acid level) and the catalytic domain (83.3% similarity). Additional sequence comparisons revealed that the amino acid similarity between the catalytic domains of Dkt1 and the three known members of the Drosophila protein kinase C (PKC) family, Dpkc1, Dpkc2 and Dpkc3, is 68%, 63.6% and 67.1%, respectively. Dakt1 was mapped to Drosophila chromosome 3R 89BC. Its expression is subject to developmental regulation with the highest levels detected within the fourth hour of embryonic development. These results confirm that the AH domain of Akt defines new protein families in both vertebrate and invertebrate eucaryotes. The high degree of homology between the catalytic domains of Dkt1 and the three known members of the Drosophila PKC family suggests an evolutionarily conserved functional relationship between the members of the two families.",1994,"T F Franke, K D Tartof, P N Tsichlis, T F Franke, K D Tartof, P N Tsichlis"
Localization of thoracic imaginal-disc precursor cells in the early embryo of Drosophila melanogaster,7873401,10.1016/0925-4773(94)90020-5,"Our previous cell lineage analysis of the thoracic disc primordia of Drosophila showed that at the blastoderm and early gastrula stage, cells are not yet committed to form either larval or imaginal tissue (Meise and Janning, 1993). We have now refined our studies on the cell lineage and have mapped the imaginal primordia in the thoracic region. Homotopic transplantations of single cells within the thoracic region of blastoderm and early gastrula stages show that the precursor cells of thoracic imaginal discs are locally restricted to a small lateral area of the thoracic region. Clones labelling leg discs frequently included the Keilin's organs. Heterotopic transplantations along the dorsoventral axis indicate that cells within the thoracic region are not yet committed with respect to larval or imaginal tissue, their fate being dependent on the position where the transplanted cell had been deposited. On the other hand, cells taken from the abdominal anlagen and transplanted into the region of thoracic disc primordia could not participate in the formation of imaginal discs. This shows that, in contrast to the dorsoventral axis, determinative events had separated primordia along the anterior-posterior axis.",1994,"M Meise, W Janning, M Meise, W Janning"
Purification and characterisation of dRP-A: a single-stranded DNA binding protein from Drosophila melanogaster,8143866,10.1016/0014-5793(94)80488-5,"Replication protein A (RP-A) is an essential single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) involved in the initiation and elongation phases of eukaryotic DNA replication. It has the ability to bind single-stranded DNA extremely tightly and possesses a characteristic hetero-trimeric structure. Here we present a method for the purification of RP-A from Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Drosophila RP-A (dRP-A) has subunits of about 66, 31 and 8 kDa, in line with analogues from other species. It binds single-stranded DNA very tightly via the large subunit. The complete protein has at least a 10- to 20-fold preference for single-stranded DNA over double-stranded DNA and it appears that binding is only weakly co-operative. Band shift experiments suggest that it has an approximate site covering the size of 16 nucleotides or less, however, it shows a greater affinity for long oligonucleotides than for short ones. We also demonstrate that dRP-A can stimulate the activity of its homologous DNA polymerase alpha in excess of 20 fold. Analysis of the protein's abundance during embryo development indicates that it varies in a manner akin to other replication proteins.",1994,"R F Marton, P ThÃ¶mmes, S Cotterill, R F Marton, P ThÃ¶mmes, S Cotterill"
Evaluation of genotoxicity of the indenoisoquinoline analogues of fagaronine and nitidine in Drosophila melanogaster,7680753,10.1016/0165-7992(93)90059-5,The wing spot test of Drosophila melanogaster was done to evaluate the genotoxicity of the antitumor indenoisoquinoline analogues of nitidine chloride and fagaronine chloride in larvae. Both compounds have toxic effects but no statistically significant increase in the frequency of spots was detected with the analogue of nitidine chloride. This strongly suggests that this compound is not mutagenic to Drosophila larvae at the concentrations tested. Results with the analogue of fagaronine chloride were ambiguous. Low mutagenicity was detected in only one of two experiments and in the pooled results at 2 mM but not at 5 mM or 10 mM. These results suggest at best a very weak genotoxic effect but its biological significance needs confirmation by results from other assays.,1993,"Y PÃ©rez-Chiesa, Z NarvÃ¡ez, Y PÃ©rez-Chiesa, Z NarvÃ¡ez"
Structure-activity relationships of tricyclic antidepressants and related compounds in the wing somatic mutation and recombination test of Drosophila melanogaster,7681526,10.1016/0027-5107(93)90179-j,"Four antidepressants and one neuroleptic drug were tested for genotoxicity using the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in wing cells of Drosophila melanogaster. Three-day-old larvae trans-heterozygous for two linked recessive wing hair mutations (multiple wing hairs and flare) were fed the test compounds in water or solvents mixed with a standard dry food for 48 h. Wings of the emerging adult flies were scored for the presence of spots of mutant cells which can result from either somatic mutation or mitotic recombination. The tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine, which is closely related to imipramine (previously shown to be genotoxic in somatic cells of Drosophila), was clearly genotoxic at concentrations above 10 mM. The structurally related antidepressants lofepramine and mianserin were positive only at 100 mM which is the maximum tolerated dose. The antidepressant maprotiline and the antipsychotic chlorpromazine, which are distinguished from the other compounds by a 6-membered central ring instead of a 7-membered one, were not genotoxic in the same dose range. These results lend further support for the hypothesis that an N atom in the heterocyclic 7-membered ring of the tricyclic molecule is responsible for the genotoxic property of the compounds in Drosophila.",1993,"N van Schaik, U Graf, N van Schaik, U Graf"
A family of human phosphodiesterases homologous to the dunce learning and memory gene product of Drosophila melanogaster are potential targets for antidepressant drugs,8413254,10.1128/mcb.13.10.6558,"We have isolated cDNAs for four human genes (DPDE1 through DPDE4) closely related to the dnc learning and memory locus of Drosophila melanogaster.

The upstream conserved regions are located in the amino-terminal regions of the proteins and appear to be unique to these genes. Polymerase chain reaction analysis suggested that these genes encoded the only homologs of dnc in the human genome. Three of the four genes were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and shown to encode cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterases. The products of the expressed genes displayed the pattern of sensitivity to inhibitors expected for members of the type IV, cyclic AMP-specific class of phosphodiesterases.

Nucleotide divergence of the rp49 gene region between Drosophila melanogaster and two species of the Obscura group of Drosophila,8483162,10.1007/BF00160479,"A 2.1-kb SstI fragment including the rp49 gene and the 3' end of the delta-serendipity gene has been cloned and sequenced in Drosophila pseudoobscura. rp49 maps at region 62 on the tip of chromosome II of this species. Both the coding and flanking regions have been aligned and compared with those of D. subobscura. There is no evidence for heterogeneity in the rate of silent substitution between the rp49 coding region and the rate of substitutions in flanking regions, the overall silent divergence per site being 0.19. Noncoding regions also differ between both species by different insertions/deletions, some of which are related to repeated sequences. The rp49 region of D. pseudoobscura shows a strong codon bias similar to those of D. subobscura and D. melanogaster. Comparison of the rates of silent (Ks) and nonsilent (Ka) substitutions of the rp49 gene and other genes completely sequenced in D. pseudoobscura and D. melanogaster confirms previous results indicating that rp49 is evolving slowly both at silent and nonsilent sites.

Cell-type-specific mechanisms of transcriptional repression by the homeotic gene products UBX and ABD-A in Drosophila embryos,8096172,,"The homeotic genes of Drosophila melanogaster, which are required for specification of segmental identities, encode proteins capable of regulating gene expression. We have chosen to study the organization and function of a regulatory target in an attempt to learn how homeotic gene products provide appropriate transcriptional controls. We identified 30 common binding sites for the proteins encoded by the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and abdominal-A (abd-A) genes within a negatively regulated target, the P2 promoter of the Antennapedia (Antp) gene. By systematically mutagenizing binding sites and observing the resulting P2 expression pattern in embryos, we have found evidence for cell-type-specific interactions that are mediated by these sequences. In certain neuronal cells, UBX and ABD-A proteins appear to repress by competing for common binding sites with another homeodomain protein, which we propose to be ANTP acting to induce P2 transcription in an autoregulatory manner. In sets of cells that contribute to the tracheal system, UBX and ABD-A repress by counteracting the function of a factor acting at independent sites. The latter mechanism of repression requires only that multiple homeodomain binding sequences be present and is not dependent on any particular binding site.",1993,"B Appel, S Sakonju, B Appel, S Sakonju"
"The three-dimensional structure of the central region in a synaptonemal complex: a comparison between rat and two insect species, Drosophila melanogaster and Blaps cribrosa",8149809,10.1007/BF00650894,"The highly ordered central region of the synaptonemal complex (SC) in Blaps cribrosa has recently been studied by electron microscope tomography (EMT), and a simple three-dimensional model presented. Using the same experimental approach we have now compared the central region in Blaps with the central regions in Drosophila melanogaster and rat. In all three species, the SCs exhibit a central element (CE) flanked by two lateral elements (LEs). The central region between the two LEs is crossed by transverse filaments (TFs). The Blaps CE element is the most ordered one with a well-defined ladder-like structure with two longitudinal components bridged by a number of regularly spaced transverse components, the rungs of the ladder. At the junctions between the longitudinal and transverse components there are prominent dense structures. The CE is multi-layered with the ladders of the separate layers in approximate register. In Drosophila the transverse CE components are as distinct and well organized as in Blaps, while in rat they are present but are less frequent and less well ordered. The longitudinal CE components in Drosophila are often fragmented and even more so in rat. The tomographic analysis revealed that in all three species the central region contains the same structural units: a single TF associated with two short pillars (or globules), which correspond to the junction structures. A fibrous lattice connects the two pillars/globules on the same TF forming the transverse CE component and those on adjacent TFs forming the longitudinal CE component; fibers between pillars/globules also link consecutive CE layers together. In the longitudinal component the number of fibrous bridges between the pillars/globules is related to the conspicuousness of the longitudinal component, i.e. Blaps has most, Drosophila almost as many, and rat considerably fewer bridges. We conclude that the central region in rat, Drosophila and Blaps contains the same basic structural unit but the degree of order and concentration of the units differ: a higher density seems to be accompanied by a higher order within the CE.",1993,"K Schmekel, U Skoglund, B Daneholt, K Schmekel, U Skoglund, B Daneholt"
Effects of transposable elements on the expression of the forked gene of Drosophila melanogaster,8244011,,"The products of the forked gene are involved in the formation and/or maintenance of a temporary fibrillar structure within the developing bristle rudiment of Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations in the forked locus alter this structure and result in aberrant development of macrochaetae, microchaetae and trichomes. The locus has been characterized at the molecular level by walking, mutant characterization and transcript analysis. Expression of the six forked transcripts is temporally restricted to mid-late pupal development. At this time, RNAs of 6.4, 5.6, 5.4, 2.5, 1.9 and 1.1 kilobases (kb) are detected by Northern analysis. The coding region of these RNAs has been found to be within a 21-kb stretch of genomic DNA. The amino terminus of the proteins encoded by the 5.4- and 5.6-kb forked transcripts contain tandem copies of ankyrin-like repeats that may play an important role in the function of forked-encoded products. The profile of forked RNA expression is altered in seven spontaneous mutations characterized during this study. Three forked mutations induced by the insertion of the gypsy retrotransposon contain a copy of this element inserted into an intron of the gene. In these mutants, the 5.6-, 5.4- and 2.5-kb forked mRNAs are truncated via recognition of the polyadenylation site in the 5' long terminal repeat of the gypsy retrotransposon. These results help explain the role of the forked gene in fly development and further our understanding of the role of transposable elements in mutagenesis.",1993,"K K Hoover, A J Chien, V G Corces, K K Hoover, A J Chien, V G Corces"
Reduced natural selection associated with low recombination in Drosophila melanogaster,8277853,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040074,"Synonymous codons are not used equally in many organisms, and the extent of codon bias varies among loci. Earlier studies have suggested that more highly expressed loci in Drosophila melanogaster are more biased, consistent with findings from several prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes that codon bias is partly due to natural selection for translational efficiency. We link this model of varying selection intensity to the population-genetics prediction that the effectiveness of natural selection is decreased under reduced recombination. In analyses of 385 D. melanogaster loci, we find that codon bias is reduced in regions of low recombination (i.e., near centromeres and telomeres and on the fourth chromosome). The effect does not appear to be a linear function of recombination rate; rather, it seems limited to regions with the very lowest levels of recombination. The large majority of the genome apparently experiences recombination at a sufficiently high rate for effective natural selection against suboptimal codons. These findings support models of the Hill-Robertson effect and genetic hitchhiking and are largely consistent with multiple reports of low levels of DNA sequence variation in regions of low recombination.",1993,"R M Kliman, J Hey, R M Kliman, J Hey"

The predicted protein sequence is similar to that of the ribosomal protein 1024 of Dictyostelium discoideum, the 40S ribosomal protein ys11 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a 22 kd protein from Trypanosoma brucei. It seems, therefore, that the Drosophila cDNA also encodes a ribosomal protein. Transcripts are found at all stages of the life cycle but are especially abundant in the ovary, suggesting that this mRNA is maternally stored for utilization in embryogenesis to enable the rapid production of ribosomal proteins and assembly of ribosomes.",1993,"N Zhang, M Bownes, N Zhang, M Bownes"
Hypergravity and aging in Drosophila melanogaster: 7. New longevity data,8137897,10.1016/0531-5565(93)90050-n,"Longevity of mated and virgin Drosophila melanogaster flies was observed at various gravity levels (1-7.38 g).

The effect of gravity was larger for females in the 1-5.14 g range, and at the highest gravity level, both sexes had roughly the same longevity, which however remained high (around 40 days). The longevity of mated flies was lower than that of virgins at 1 g, and only a slight longevity decrease was observed in the 1-7.38 g range in females, this decrease being larger for males. Hypergravity appears to have no dramatic effects on life span and to be of lower importance than the simple effect of mating.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity in Drosophila melanogaster adults: evidence for cytosolic localization,8353517,10.1016/0965-1748(93)90027-p,"The subcellular localization of the aldehyde dehydrogenase activity from the ALDH (EC 1.2.1.3) enzyme has been studied in nutritionally manipulated Drosophila melanogaster adults from a wild (LRC) and an ADH-null (bAdhn4) strain. ALDH activities from ALDH or ADH (EC 1.1.1.1) enzymes were selectively inhibited by prefeeding respectively the flies sucrose solutions supplemented with either cyanamide or acetone respectively. ALDH, ADH (as a cytosolic marker) and succinate dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.9.1) (as a mitochondrial marker) activities were assayed in both the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions isolated from flies subjected to each treatment. Total ALDH activity in the cytosolic fraction was found to be between five (ADH strain) and ten (ADH strain) times higher than that in the mitochondrial fraction. Prefeeding cyanamide resulted in a 64% (ADH strain) and a 90% (ADH strain) reduction of the cytosolic ALDH activity, whereas prefeeding acetone resulted in a 38% (ADH strain) reduction of this activity. Prefeeding both cyanamide and acetone resulted in a total inhibition of ALDH activity, which was also observed after an extended cyanamide treatment. In conclusion, our results support that, contrary to what occurs in larvae, in adults the ALDH activity from ALDH enzyme is mainly localized in the cytosolic fraction: about 85% in ADH+ and 90% in ADH- strains. Although larvae and adults use different ALDH activities to detoxify acetaldehyde (from ADH and ALDH enzymes, respectively) both of them are cytosolic. Reasons for these different uses are discussed in relation to the subcellular localization of ALDH activity.",1993,"J F Leal, M Barbancho, J F Leal, M Barbancho"

Otherwise the structure and predicted protein are very similar to those of other species. (2) There is a significant shift in codon usage, especially compared with that in D. melanogaster Adh. The most striking shift is from C to U in the wobble position (both third and first position). Unlike the codon-usage-bias pattern typical of highly biased genes in D. melanogaster, including Adh, D. willistoni has nearly 50% G + C in the third position.

Embryonic origin of the imaginal discs of the head of Drosophila melanogaster,28305981,10.1007/BF00539891,"The embryonic development of the primordia of the Drosophila head was studied by using an enhancer trap line expressed in these structures from embryonic stage 13 onward. Particular attention was given to the question of how the adult head primordia relate to the larval head segments. The clypeo-labral bud to the stage 13 embryo is located at a lateral position in the labrum adjacent to the labral sensory complex (""epiphysis""). Both clypeo-labral bud and sensory complex are located anterior to the engrailed-expression domain of the labrum. Throughout late embryogenesis and the larval period, the clypeo-labral bud forms integral part of the epithelium lining the roof of the atrium. The labial disc originates from the lateral labial segment adjacent to the labial sensory complex (""hypophysis""). It partially overlaps with the labial en-domain. After head involution, the labial disc forms a small pocket in the ventro-lateral wall of the atrium. The eye-antenna disc develops from a relatively large territory occupying the dorso-posterior part of the procephalic lobe, as well as parts of the dorsal gnathal segments. Cells in this territory are greatly reduced in number by cell death during stages 12-14. After head involution, the presumptive eye-antenna disc occupies a position in the lateral-posterior part of the dorsal pouch. Evagination of this tissue occurs during the first hours after hatching.

Purification and characterization of a multiprotein component of the Drosophila 26 S (1500 kDa) proteolytic complex,8386175,,"A multiprotein complex, referred to as the mu particle, was purified to apparent homogeneity from Drosophila melanogaster embryos. This multiprotein complex has no protease activity, but it can be incorporated into an even larger multiprotein complex which exhibits strong and selective protease activity, i.e. it degrades only ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Incorporation of the mu particle into the ubiquitin conjugate-degrading larger complex is absolutely ATP-dependent. On these criteria the larger complex corresponds to the 26 S (1500 kDa) proteolytic complex partially purified and characterized from reticulocytes. A procedure is described for the purification of the Drosophila 26 S (1500 kDa) proteolytic complex. It was found to be a stoichiometric complex of the mu particle and the 20 S proteosome. Although no other polypeptide was present in stoichiometric amount in the 26 S (1500 kDa) proteolytic complex besides the mu particle and the 20 S proteosome, an additional protein factor(s) is required for its assembly, the ubiquitin conjugate-degrading activity cannot be reconstituted from the purified mu particle and the 20 S proteosome. Synthesis of the mu particle is developmentally regulated; its concentration is highest in embryos. This is probably connected with massive degradation of yolk proteins during embryogenesis. In chicken, rabbit and human cells a high molecular weight multiprotein complex can be detected, which is immunologically related to the Drosophila mu particle.",1993,"A Udvardy, A Udvardy"

In accord with its relatively high ability to alkylate oxygens in DNA, the most frequent type of sequence alteration among the basepair changes are GC-AT transitions, accounting for 73% of mutations, followed by transversions AT-TA (10%). DES also induced AT-GC transitions and AT-CG transversions. Both induced deletions were intralocus deletions, not occurring between basepair repeats. No influence of neighboring bases on the mutation position was found.",1993,"L M Sierra, A Pastink, M J Nivard, E W Vogel, L M Sierra, A Pastink, M J Nivard, E W Vogel"
Compositional heterogeneity and patterns of molecular evolution in the Drosophila genome,8349114,,"The rates and patterns of molecular evolution in many eukaryotic organisms have been shown to be influenced by the compartmentalization of their genomes into fractions of distinct base composition and mutational properties. We have examined the Drosophila genome to explore relationships between the nucleotide content of large chromosomal segments and the base composition and rate of evolution of genes within those segments. Direct determination of the G + C contents of yeast artificial chromosome clones containing inserts of Drosophila melanogaster DNA ranging from 140-340 kb revealed significant heterogeneity in base composition. The G + C content of the large segments studied ranged from 36.9% G + C for a clone containing the hunchback locus in polytene region 85, to 50.9% G + C for a clone that includes the rosy region in polytene region 87. Unlike other organisms, however, there was no significant correlation between the base composition of large chromosomal regions and the base composition at fourfold degenerate nucleotide sites of genes encompassed within those regions. Despite the situation seen in mammals, there was also no significant association between base composition and rate of nucleotide substitution. These results suggest that nucleotide sequence evolution in Drosophila differs from that of many vertebrates and does not reflect distinct mutational biases, as a function of base composition, in different genomic regions. Significant negative correlations between codon-usage bias and rates of synonymous site divergence, however, provide strong support for an argument that selection among alternative codons may be a major contributor to variability in evolutionary rates within Drosophila genomes.",1993,"J P Carulli, D E Krane, D L Hartl, H Ochman, J P Carulli, D E Krane, D L Hartl, H Ochman"
Dietary ethanol stimulates the activity of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D and the formation of phosphatidylethanol in Drosophila melanogaster larvae,8353529,10.1016/0965-1748(93)90049-x,"When administered in the diet to third instar Drosophila melanogaster larvae, short chain primary alcohols reduce phosphatidylcholine (PC) levels. The ethanol-induced reductions in larval PC may be in part due to an increase in the activity of PC-specific phospholipase D (PC-specific PLD, EC 3.1.4.4). PC-specific PLD not only hydrolyzes PC, but it also apparently catalyzes the formation of phosphatidylethanol. PC-specific PLD activity was also stimulated by 200 mM ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, and n-propanol. In vitro studies indicated that Drosophila PC-specific PLD activities were enhanced by submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+ and by GTP-gamma S. In vivo studies utilizing [14C]lyso-palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine indicated that dietary ethanol promoted the flux of label into triacylglycerol, 1,2 diacylglycerol, and fatty acid ethyl esters, while the label in PC decreased.",1993,"R R Miller Jr, J W Yates, B W Geer, R R Miller Jr, J W Yates, B W Geer"
"Comparison of the Drosophila melanogaster, human and murine Sm B cDNAs: evolutionary conservation",7680326,10.1016/0378-1119(93)90404-q,"To analyze the evolutionary stability of the Sm B polypeptides, the cDNA nucleotide (nt) sequence was derived for the Drosophila melanogaster Sm B polypeptide and compared to the cDNAs encoding human and murine Sm B. The three cDNAs were transcribed and translated in reticulocyte lysates followed by analysis of the synthesized proteins by SDS-PAGE. D. melanogaster B migrated at approximately 25 kDa, in comparison to 28 kDa for the murine and human B proteins, although all three proteins were immunoprecipitated by human anti-Sm autoantibodies and by the Y12 anti-Sm murine monoclonal antibody (Y12 mAb). Immunoblots and immunoprecipitations of [35S]methionine-labeled D. melanogaster S2/M3 cells confirmed the smaller size of the D. melanogaster protein, and revealed that B' was absent in this cell line, as in murine cells. In comparison to the 231 amino acids (aa) of human and murine B, the deduced sequence for the D. melanogaster clone was 199 aa (predicted M(r) of 24,598) with two 5-aa deletions and a 19-aa truncation at the 3' end, compared to the other two clones. D. melanogaster protein B shared 65% aa sequence identity with the human and mouse clones, and 80% similarity when conservative aa substitutions were noted. The C-terminal portion of the D. melanogaster protein was the most evolutionarily variable in comparison to the deduced aa sequences for the other two proteins; however, autoantigenic epitopes bound by human anti-Sm antibodies and the Y12 mAb in this region of the protein were conserved across species lines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1993,"C Brunet, T Quan, J Craft"
Codon usage patterns in chromosomal and retrotransposon genes of the mosquito Anopheles gambiae,8269095,10.1111/j.1365-2583.1993.tb00089.x,"Codon usage was compiled for fourteen chromosomal genes and four retrotransposons from the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. Variation exists among chromosomal genes in the degree of bias. The genes showing the highest bias are probably most highly expressed. In these genes, the base composition at the third codon position is much richer in G + C than is the overall coding sequence. Thus, codon usage is biased toward G- or C-ending codons. Codon usage in each retrotransposon is quite different, not only from chromosomal genes but also from the other retrotransposons. Codon usage comparisons among homologous genes from An. gambiae and two other Dipterans, the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti and the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, show that while there are similarities, particularly between An. gambiae and D. melanogaster in the preference for G- and C-ending codons, each species has evolved a distinct pattern of codon usage.",1993,"N J Besansky, N J Besansky"

Drosophila acetylcholinesterase: mechanisms of resistance to organophosphates,8343979,10.1016/0009-2797(93)90047-3,"Quantitative and qualitative changes of acetylcholinesterase can affect the sensitivity of insects to insecticides. First, the amount of acetylcholinesterase in the central nervous system is important in Drosophila melanogaster, flies which overexpress the enzyme are more resistant than wild-type flies. On the contrary, flies which express low levels of acetylcholinesterase are more susceptible. An overproduction of acetylcholinesterase outside the central nervous system also protects against organophosphate poisoning, that is, flies producing a soluble acetylcholinesterase, secreted in the haemolymph, are resistant to organophosphates. Second, resistance can also result from a qualitative modification of acetylcholinesterase. Four mutations have been identified in resistant strains: Phe115 to Ser, Ileu199 to Val, Gly303 to Ala and Phe368 to Tyr. Each of these mutations led to a different pattern of resistance and combinations between these mutations led to highly resistant enzymes.",1993,"D Fournier, A Mutero, M Pralavorio, J M Bride, D Fournier, A Mutero, M Pralavorio, J M Bride"
Structure and expression of hybrid dysgenesis-induced alleles of the ovarian tumor (otu) gene in Drosophila melanogaster,8436274,,"Mutations at the ovarian tumor (otu) gene of Drosophila melanogaster cause female sterility and generate a range of ovarian phenotypes. Quiescent (QUI) mutants exhibit reduced germ cell proliferation; in oncogenic (ONC) mutants germ cells undergo uncontrolled proliferation generating excessive numbers of undifferentiated cells; the egg chambers of differentiated (DIF) mutants differentiate to variable degrees but fail to complete oogenesis. We have examined mutations caused by insertion and deletion of P elements at the otu gene. The P element insertion sites are upstream of the major otu transcription start sites. In deletion derivatives, the P element, regulatory regions and/or protein coding sequences have been removed. In both insertion and deletion mutants, the level of otu expression correlates directly with the severity of the phenotype: the absence of otu function produces the most severe QUI phenotype while the ONC mutants express lower levels of otu than those which are DIF. The results of this study demonstrate that the diverse mutant phenotypes of otu are the consequence of different levels of otu function.",1993,"G L Sass, J D Mohler, R C Walsh, L J Kalfayan, L L Searles, G L Sass, J D Mohler, R C Walsh, L J Kalfayan, L L Searles"
Distribution of swallow protein in egg chambers and embryos of Drosophila melanogaster,7507030,,"The Drosophila maternal effect gene swallow has a role in localizing bicoid mRNA at the anterior margin of the oocyte during oogenesis, and a poorly characterized role in nuclear divisions in early embryogenesis. We have examined the distribution of swallow protein during oogenesis and embryogenesis using anti-swallow antibodies. During oogenesis, high levels of swallow protein are present in basal nurse cell cytoplasm, although small amounts are also present at the anterior oocyte margin, the site of bicoid RNA localization. Only a small fraction of swallow protein is in a position to interact directly with bicoid RNA during localization. The asymmetric distribution of swallow protein is disrupted in swallow ovaries, in which bicoid RNA becomes unlocalized late in oogenesis. swallow protein is uniformly distributed in eggs, but becomes localized to nuclei during early mitotic divisions in early embryogenesis. swallow protein enters each nucleus at the beginning of mitosis, occupies a position complementary to that of condensed chromatin, and leaves each nucleus at the end of mitosis. We show examples of nuclear division defects in swallow mutant embryos, and suggest that the abnormal nuclear divisions in early swallow embryos reflect a second function for swallow protein that contributes to abdominal segmentation defects common in swallow embryos.",1993,"J HegdÃ©, E C Stephenson, J HegdÃ©, E C Stephenson"
Molecular evolution of the 5'-flanking regions of the duplicated Amy genes in Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup,8882500,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025617,"The nucleotide sequences of the 5'-flanking regions of the duplicated Amy genes in eight sibling species belonging to the melanogaster species subgroup are analyzed. In Drosophila melanogaster, a region of about 450 bp immediately upstream of the translation initiation site of the two paralogous genes (the proximal and distal genes) has sequence similarities. However, we could not detect any significant sequence similarity in the region more upstream than -450. This result indicates that the coding regions of the ancestral Amy gene were duplicated together with 450 bp of the 5'-flanking region as one unit. Multiple alignment of these 450-bp sequences in the proximal and distal genes of all eight species revealed a mosaic pattern of highly conserved and divergent regions. The conserved regions included almost all the putative regulatory elements identified in previous analyses of the sequences. A phylogenetic analysis of the aligned sequences shows that these 450-bp sequences are clustered into the proximal and the distal groups. As a whole, the divergence between groups in this region is very large in contrast to that in the coding regions. Based on the divergence between groups, the 450-bp region is divided into two subregions. We found that the ratios of the divergence between groups to that within groups differ in the two subregions. From these observations, we discuss a possibility of positive selection acting on the subregion immediately upstream of the Amy coding region to cause divergence of regulatory elements of the paralogous genes.",1996,"E Okuyama, H Shibata, H Tachida, T Yamazaki, E Okuyama, H Shibata, H Tachida, T Yamazaki"
Halothane resistance in Drosophila melanogaster: development of a model and gene localization techniques,8659726,10.1097/00000539-199607000-00026,"Studying genetically altered animals that are resistant to inhaled anesthetics may ultimately lead to an understanding of anesthetics' mechanism(s) of action. We studied the genetics of halothane resistance in a strain of Drosophila melanogaster that showed substantially increased resistance to halothane anesthesia. We developed a test method that allowed us to repeatedly observe several samples of flies exposed to the same concentration of halothane, and we measured halothane resistance. The 50% effective dose (ED50) of 91R flies (our resistant population) was greater than the ED50 of Canton-S (our control strain) by 69% in females and by 48% in males. By assessing the contributions of the three major chromosomes of Drosophila to resistance, this study found that the X and third chromosomes of 91R have no effect on resistance, while the second chromosome has a major impact. Resistance within the second chromosome was further localized by testing marked recombinant chromosomes. The central region of 91R's second chromosome, bounded by the genes for black thoracic color and cinnabar eye color, determined most if not all of the increase in resistance. We were not able to further localize resistance within this segment of the second chromosome (containing about 8% of the total genetic map distance). An autosomal dominant gene for halothane resistance in 91R was localized to a small region of the second chromosome.",1996,"D Dapkus, S Ramirez, M J Murray, D Dapkus, S Ramirez, M J Murray"
Localization of sequences regulating ancestral and acquired sites of esterase6 activity in Drosophila melanogaster,8754215,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025639,"We have broadly defined the DNA regions regulating esterase6 activity in several life stages and tissue types of D. melanogaster using P-element-mediated transformation of constructs that contain the esterase6 coding region and deletions or substitutions in 5' or 3' flanking DNA. Hemolymph is a conserved ancestral site of EST6 activity in Drosophila and the primary sequences regulating its activity lie between -171 and -25 bp relative to the translation initiation site: deletion of these sequences decrease activity approximately 20-fold. Hemolymph activity is also modulated by four other DNA regions, three of which lie 5' and one of which lies 3' of the coding region. Of these, two have positive and two have negative effects, each of approximately twofold. Esterase6 activity is present also in two male reproductive tract tissues; the ejaculatory bulb, which is another ancestral activity site, and the ejaculatory duct, which is a recently acquired site within the melanogaster species subgroup. Activities in these tissues are at least in part independently regulated: activity in the ejaculatory bulb is conferred by sequences between -273 and -172 bp (threefold decrease when deleted), while activity in the ejaculatory duct is conferred by more distal sequences between -844 and -614 bp (fourfold decrease when deleted). The reproductive tract activity is further modulated by two additional DNA regions, one in 5' DNA (-613 to -284 bp; threefold decrease when deleted) and the other in 3' DNA (+1860 to +2731 bp; threefold decrease when deleted) that probably overlaps the adjacent esteraseP gene. Collating these data with previous studies suggests that expression of EST6 in the ancestral sites is mainly regulated by conserved proximal sequences while more variable distal sequences regulate expression in the acquired ejaculatory duct site.",1996,"M J Healy, M M Dumancic, A Cao, J G Oakeshott, M J Healy, M M Dumancic, A Cao, J G Oakeshott"

To determine which one of the strains available for this test would be advisable to evaluate agents producing reactive oxygen species we have used two approaches. Firstly, the w/w+ assay was carried out using 6 different strains and two compounds: menadione and paraquat. Secondly, 3 biochemical traits were determined for the 6 strains: superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, and their capacity to induce reactive oxygen species.

Reduced transmitter release conferred by mutations in the slowpoke-encoded Ca2(+)-activated K+ channel gene of Drosophila,9372155,10.1007/BF02336660,"Potassium channels control the repolarization of nerve terminals and thus play important roles in the control of synaptic transmission. Here we describe the effects of mutations in the slowpoke gene, which is the structural gene for a calcium activated potassium channel, on transmitter release at the neuromuscular junction in Drosophila melanogaster. Surprisingly, we find that the slowpoke mutant exhibits reduced transmitter release compared to normal. Similarly, the slowpoke mutation significantly suppresses the increased transmitter release conferred either by a mutation in Shaker or by application of 4-aminopyridine, which blocks the Shaker-encoded potassium channel at the Drosophila nerve terminal. Furthermore, the slowpoke mutation suppresses the striking increase in transmitter release that occurs following application of 4-aminopyridine to the ether a go-go mutant. This suppression is most likely the result of a reduction of Ca2+ influx into the nerve terminal in the slowpoke mutant. We hypothesize that the effects of the slowpoke mutation are indirect, perhaps resulting from increased Ca2+ channel inactivation, decreased Na+ or Ca2+ channel localization or gene expression, or by increases in the expression or activity of potassium channels distinct from slowpoke.",1996,"L Warbington, T Hillman, C Adams, M Stern, L Warbington, T Hillman, C Adams, M Stern"

Heat-shock resistance in Drosophila populations: analysis of variation in reciprocal cross progeny,8690613,10.1111/j.1601-5223.1996.00047.x,"Genetic variation for resistance to high temperature stress was studied in populations of D. melanogaster and D. buzzatii from different geographic regions.

Heat-stress resistance varied among populations, with one much more resistant than all others under both treatments. Another possessed low stress resistance when exposed without the heat pretreatment; but with pretreatment, resistance increased relative to the other populations. Evidence from reciprocal crosses suggests that the X chromosome of the more resistant population carries alleles that greatly increase resistance, and that one or more factors on the autosomes also affect resistance. Non-additive interaction effects among the three less resistant population, were suggestive that all differ for various elements that contribute to stress resistance, and that some clearly change inducible resistance more than basal levels. In D. buzzatii, the two least resistant populations were genetically very similar. Crosses to the more resistant population gave results suggesting that the low resistance to heat is dominant. A small X-chromosome effect that increased resistance, and a dominant enhancer of male resistance also may have contributed to variation in resistance.",1996,"R A Krebs, V La Torre, V Loeschcke, S Cavicchi, R A Krebs, V La Torre, V Loeschcke, S Cavicchi"

We report here the partial cloning and characterization of 89B helicase, a gene encoding a new Drosophila melanogaster member of the SNF2 family. 89B Helicase protein shows a high degree of homology in its ATPase/helicase domain to the global transcriptional activators SNF2 and Brahma and to the DNA repair proteins ERCC6 and RAD54. It is, however, most strikingly similar to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Mot1, a transcriptional repressor with many target genes for which no homologue has yet been described. 89B helicase is expressed throughout fly development and its large transcript encodes a >200 kDa protein. Staining with anti-89B Helicase antibodies reveals that the protein is present uniformly in early embryos and then becomes localized to the ventral nerve cord and brain. On the polytene chromosomes, 89B Helicase is bound to several hundred specific sites that are randomly distributed. The homology of 89B Helicase to Mot1, its widespread developmental expression and its large number of targets on the polytene chromosomes of larval salivary gland cells suggest that 89B Helicase may play a role in chromosomal metabolism, particularly global transcriptional regulation.",1996,"R Goldman-Levi, C Miller, J Bogoch, N B Zak, R Goldman-Levi, C Miller, J Bogoch, N B Zak"

Structure of the Y chromosomal Su(Ste) locus in Drosophila melanogaster and evidence for localized recombination among repeats,8770592,,"The structure of the Suppressor of Stellate [Su(Ste)] locus on the Drosophila melanogaster Y chromosome was examined by restriction analysis of both native and cloned genomic DNA. The locus consists of short subarrays of tandem repeats separated by members of other moderately repeated families. Both size variants and restriction variants proved to be common. Most repeats fell into two size classes-2.8 and 2.5 kb-but other size variants were also observed. Restriction variants showed a strong tendency to cluster, both at the gross level where some variants were present in only one of three subintervals of the locus, and at the fine level, where repeats from the same phage clone were significantly more similar than repeats from different clones. Restriction variants were shared freely among repeats of different size classes; however, size variants appeared to be randomly distributed among phage clones. These data indicate that recombination among tandem Su(Ste) repeats occurs at much higher frequencies between close neighbors than distant ones. In addition, they suggest that gene conversion rather than sister chromatid exchange may be the primary recombinational mechanism for spreading variation among repeats at the Su(Ste) locus.",1996,"B D McKee, M T Satter, B D McKee, M T Satter"
Molecular characterization of the lysosomal acid phosphatase from Drosophila melanogaster,8676866,10.1007/BF02174451,"In Drosophila, unlike humans, the lysosomal acid phosphatase (Acph-1) is a non-essential enzyme. It is also one of the most rapidly evolving gene-enzyme systems in the genus. In order to determine which parts of the enzyme are conserved and which parts are apparently under little functional constraint, we cloned the gene from Drosophila melanogaster via a chromosomal walk. Fragments from the gene were used to recover an apparently full-length cDNA. The cDNA was sub-cloned into a Drosophila transformation vector where it was under the control of the 5' promoter sequence of the hsp-70 gene. Three independent transformants were obtained; in each, Acph-1 expression from the cDNA was constitutive and not dependent on heat shock, as determined by densitometric analyses of the allozymic forms of the enzyme. The pattern of expression indicates the hsp-70 and endogenous Acph-1 promoters act together in some, but not all, tissues. The sequence of the cDNA was determined using deletions made with exonuclease III, and primers deduced from the cDNA sequence were used to sequence the genomic clone. Five introns were found, and putative 5' upstream regulatory sequences were identified.

Roles for Rac1 and Cdc42 in planar polarization and hair outgrowth in the wing of Drosophila,8947551,10.1083/jcb.135.5.1277,"The wing of Drosophila melanogaster is covered by an array of distally pointing hairs. A hair begins as a single membrane outgrowth from each wing epithelial cell, and its distal orientation is determined by the restriction of outgrowth to a single distal site on the cell circumference (Wong, L., and P. Adler. 1993. J. Cell Biol. 123:209-211.). We have examined the roles of Cdc42 and Rac1 in the formation of wing hairs. We find that Cdc42 is required for localized actin polymerization in the extending hair. Interfering with Cdc42 activity by expression of a dominant negative protein abolishes both localized actin polymerization and hair outgrowth. In contrast, Rac1 is important for restricting the site at which hairs grow out. Cells expressing the dominant negative Rac1N17 fail to restrict outgrowth to a single site and give rise to multiple wing hairs. This polarity defect is associated with disturbances in the organization of junctional actin and also with disruption of an intricate microtubule network that is intimately associated with the junctional region. We also find that apical junctions and microtubules are involved in structural aspects of hair outgrowth.

THERMAL EVOLUTION OF EGG SIZE IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,28565673,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03621.x,"We measured the size of eggs produced by populations of Drosophila melanogaster that had been collected along latitudinal gradients in different continents or that had undergone several years of culture at different temperatures in the laboratory. Australian and South American populations from higher latitudes produced larger eggs when all were compared at a standard temperature. Laboratory populations that had been evolving at 16.5Â°C produced larger eggs than populations that had evolved at 25Â°C or 29Â°C, suggesting that temperature may be an important selective agent in producing the latitudinal clines. Flies from laboratory populations produced larger eggs at an experimental temperature of 16.5Â°C than at 25Â°C, and there was no indication of genotype-environment interaction for egg size. Evolution of egg size in response to temperature cannot be accounted for by differences in adult body size between populations. It is not clear which life-history traits are direct targets of thermal selection and which are showing correlated responses, and disentangling these is a task for the future.",1996,"Ricardo B R Azevedo, Vernon French, Linda Partridge, Ricardo B R Azevedo, Vernon French, Linda Partridge"
Genetics and the environment in interspecific competition: a study using the sibling species Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,28307735,10.1007/BF00333216,"The outcome of interspecific competition of two closely related species may depend upon genetic variation in the two species and the environment in which the experiment is carried out. Interspecific competition in the two sibling species, Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans, is usually investigated using longterm laboratory stocks that often have mutant markers that distinguish them. To examine competition in flies that genetically more closely resemble flies in nature, we utilized freshly caught wildtype isofemale lines of the two species collected at the same site in San Carlos, Mexico. Under ordinary laboratory conditions, D. melanogaster always won in competition. However, in hotter and drier conditions, D. simulans competed much more effectively. In these environmental conditions, there were genetic differences in competitive ability among lines with the outcome of competition primarily dependent upon the line of D. melanogaster used but in some cases also influenced by the line of D. simulans used. Differences in the measures of productivity and developmental time did not explain the differences in competitive ability among lines. This suggests that the outcome of competition was not due to differences in major fitness components among the isofemale lines but to some other attribute(s) that influenced competitive ability. When lines of flies were combined, the outcome of competition was generally consistent with competitive outcomes between pairs of lines. In several cases, the combination of lines performed better than the best of the constituent lines, suggesting that competitive ability was combined heterotically and that the total amount of genetic variation was important in the outcome of interspecific competition.",1996,"Philip W Hedrick, Elizabeth King"
A homolog of human transcription factor NF-X1 encoded by the Drosophila shuttle craft gene is required in the embryonic central nervous system,8524296,10.1128/mcb.16.1.192,"NF-X1 is a novel cytokine-inducible transcription factor that has been implicated in the control of immune responses in humans, presumably by regulating expression of class II major histocompatibility genes. Here we report the cloning and genetic characterization of the first reported NF-X1 homolog, which is encoded by the Drosophila melanogaster shuttle craft (stc) gene. The deduced sequence of the fly and human proteins defines a new family of molecules distinguished by a novel cysteine-rich DNA-binding motif (consisting of seven copies of the consensus sequence Cx3Cx3LxCGx0-5HxCx3CHxGxCx2Cx7-9CxC). We have identified and begun a phenotypic characterization of mutations in the stc gene. stc mutants die at the end of embryogenesis, when they appear to be incapable of coordinating the typical peristaltic contraction waves normally required for embryos to hatch into feeding first instar larvae. Preliminary evidence indicates that the resulting lethality of this behavioral defect is accompanied by subtle morphological abnormalities in the central nervous system, where in wild-type embryos, STC protein is normally localized in the nuclei of repeated cell clusters within each neuromere and brain lobe. Thus, the NF-X1 homolog encoded by the Drosophila stc gene defines a new family of putative transcription factors and plays an essential role in the completion of embryonic development. This study presents the first in vivo genetic analysis of a member of this new protein family.",1996,"N D Stroumbakis, Z Li, P P Tolias, N D Stroumbakis, Z Li, P P Tolias"
ADAPTATION TO FERMENTING RESOURCES IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER: ETHANOL AND ACETIC ACID TOLERANCES SHARE A COMMON GENETIC BASIS,28568957,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03886.x,"Ethanol and acetic acid tolerances were compared in a French, highly tolerant population, and in a Congolese, very sensitive population. For both tolerances, chromosome substitutions demonstrated a major effect on chromosome 3, a lesser effect on chromosome 2, and no effect on chromosome 1, except in interactions. Directional selection experiments led to significant increases of tolerance to both toxics. Of greater interest, a strong correlated response was observed in each line: increased ethanol tolerance was accompanied by higher acetic acid tolerance and vice versa. A high genetic correlation (average value r = 0.77) was found between the two traits. These data suggest that alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity does not play a major role in explaining the physiological differences known between Afrotropical and European populations. The metabolic flux permitting the detoxification of ethanol and acetic acid seems to be mainly controlled by acetyl-coA synthetase (ACS) at least in adult flies.

A genetic screen for mutations that disrupt an auditory response in Drosophila melanogaster,9405700,10.1073/pnas.94.26.14837,"Hearing is one of the last sensory modalities to be subjected to genetic analysis in Drosophila melanogaster. We describe a behavioral assay for auditory function involving courtship among groups of males triggered by the pulse component of the courtship song. In a mutagenesis screen for mutations that disrupt the auditory response, we have recovered 15 mutations that either reduce or abolish this response. Mutant audiograms indicate that seven mutants reduced the amplitude of the response at all intensities. Another seven abolished the response altogether. The other mutant, 5L3, responded only at high sound intensities, indicating that the threshold was shifted in this mutant. Six mutants were characterized in greater detail. 5L3 had a general courtship defect; courtship of females by 5L3 males also was affected strongly. 5P1 males courted females normally but had reduced success at copulation. 5P1 and 5N18 showed a significant decrement in olfactory response, indicating that the defects in these mutations are not specific to the auditory pathway. Two other mutants, 5M8 and 5N30, produced amotile sperm although in 5N30 this phenotype was genetically separable from the auditory phenotype. Finally, a new adult circling behavior phenotype, the pirouette phenotype, associated with massive neurodegeneration in the brain, was discovered in two mutants, 5G10 and 5N18.

"UbcD1, a Drosophila ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme required for proper telomere behavior",9106658,10.1101/gad.11.7.863,"The end-to-end association of chromosomes through their telomeres has been observed in normal cells of certain organisms, as well as in senescent and tumor cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are currently unknown. We show here that five independent mutant alleles in the Drosophila UbcD1 gene cause frequent telomere-telomere attachments during both mitosis and male meiosis that are not seen in wild type. These telomeric associations involve all the telomeres of the D. melanogaster chromosome complement, albeit with different frequencies. The pattern of telomeric associations observed in UbcD1 mutants suggests strongly that the interphase chromosomes of wild-type larval brain cells maintain a Rab1 orientation within the nucleus, with the telomeres and centromeres segregated to opposite sides of the nucleus. The UbcD1 gene encodes a class I ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzyme. This indicates that ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is normally needed to ensure proper telomere behavior during Drosophila cell division. We therefore suggest that at least one of the targets of UbcD1 ubiquitination is a telomere-associated polypeptide that may help maintain proper chromosomal orientation during interphase.",1997,"G Cenci, R B Rawson, G Belloni, D H Castrillon, M Tudor, R Petrucci, M L Goldberg, S A Wasserman, M Gatti, G Cenci, R B Rawson, G Belloni, D H Castrillon, M Tudor, R Petrucci, M L Goldberg, S A Wasserman, M Gatti"
A new enhancer of position-effect variegation in Drosophila melanogaster encodes a putative RNA helicase that binds chromosomes and is regulated by the cell cycle,9215899,,"In Drosophila melanogaster, position-effect variegation of the white gene has been a useful phenomenon by which to study chromosome structure and the genes that modify it. We have identified a new enhancer of variegation locus, Dmrnahel (hel). Deletion of mutation of hel enhances white variegation, and this can be reversed by a transformed copy of hel+. In the presence of two endogenous copies, the transformed hel+ behaves as a suppressor of variegation. hel is an essential gene and functions both maternally and zygotically. The HEL protein is similar to known RNA helicases, but contains an unusual variant (DECD) of the DEAD motif common to these proteins. Potential HEL homologues have been found in mammals, yeast and worms. HEL protein associates with salivary gland chromosomes and locates to nuclei of embryos and ovaries, but disappears in mitotic domains of embryos as chromosomes condense. We propose that the HEL protein promotes an open chromatin structure that favors transcription during development by regulating the spread of heterochromatin, and that HEL is regulated by, and may have a role in, the mitotic cell cycle during embryogenesis.",1997,"D F Eberl, L J Lorenz, M B Melnick, V Sood, P Lasko, N Perrimon, D F Eberl, L J Lorenz, M B Melnick, V Sood, P Lasko, N Perrimon"

"Establishing primordia in the Drosophila eye-antennal imaginal disc: the roles of decapentaplegic, wingless and hedgehog",9428415,,"The eye-antennal imaginal discs of Drosophila melanogaster form the head capsule of the adult fly. Unlike the limb primordia, each eye-antennal disc gives rise to morphologically and functionally distinct structures. As a result, these discs provide an excellent model system for determining how the fates of primordia are specified during development. In this study, we investigated how the adjacent primordia of the compound eye and dorsal head vertex are specified. We show that the genes wingless (wg) and orthodenticle (otd) are expressed throughout the entire second instar eye-antennal disc, conferring a default fate of dorsal vertex cuticle. Activation of decapentaplegic (dpp) expression in the posterior eye disc eliminates wg and otd expression, thereby permitting eye differentiation. We also demonstrate that otd is activated by wg in the vertex primordium. Finally, we show that early activation of dpp depends on hedgehog (hh) expression in the eye anlage prior to morphogenetic furrow formation.",1997,"J Royet, R Finkelstein, J Royet, R Finkelstein"
Drosophila telomere elongation,9524751,10.1002/9780470515433.ch5,"Drosophila melanogaster has an unusual telomere elongation mechanism. Instead of short repeats that are synthesized by telomerase, long retrotransposons, HeT-A and TART, transpose to the ends of chromosomes. This mechanism generates tandem arrays of these elements at the chromosome ends, in which all elements are oriented with their oligo(A) tails towards the centromere. Structural features of HeT-A and TART elements may provide clues as to their transposition mechanism. Drosophila telomere length polymorphism is mainly due to terminal retrotransposon arrays that differ between chromosome tips and that change with time. In addition, stable terminal chromosome deletions can be generated that do not contain terminal HeT-A and TART arrays, suggesting that, unlike the equivalent terminal repeats in yeast and humans, the presence and length of terminal arrays in Drosophila may not be critical for cell cycle progression.",1997,"H Biessmann, M F Walter, J M Mason, H Biessmann, M F Walter, J M Mason"
Two-step induction of chordotonal organ precursors in Drosophila embryogenesis,9056779,,"The chordotonal (Ch) organ, an internal stretch receptor located in the subepidermal layer, is one of the major sensory organs in the peripheral nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster. Although the cell lineage of the Ch organ has been well characterized in many studies, the determination machinery of Ch organ precursor cells (COPs) remains largely unresolved. Here we report that the rhomboid (rho) gene and the activity of the Drosophila EGF receptor (DER) signaling pathway are necessary to induce specifically three of the eight COPs in an embryonic abdominal hemisegment. The cell-lineage analysis of COPs using the yeast flpase (flp/FRT) method indicated that each of the eight COPs originated from an individual undifferentiated ectodermal cell. The eight COPs in each abdominal hemisegment seemed to be determined by a two-phase induction: first, five COPs are determined by the action of the proneural gene atonal and neurogenic genes. Subsequently, these five COPs start to express the rho gene, and rho activates the DER-signaling pathway in neighboring cells and induces argos expression. Three of these argos-expressing cells differentiate into the three remaining COPs and they prevent neighboring cells from becoming extra COPs.",1997,"M Okabe, H Okano, M Okabe, H Okano"
Hypergravity and aging in Drosophila melanogaster. 9. Conditioned suppression and habituation of the proboscis extension response,9359939,,"In a first experiment, the conditioned suppression of the proboscis extension response (PER) to sucrose was measured in young, middle-aged and old male Drosophila melanogaster flies living at either 1, 3 or 5 g. Flies were starved and then subjected to a learning task involving a sucrose stimulus, followed by an aversive one applied to their forelegs. In this learning task, flies learn to not extend their proboscis when walking on sucrose. Flies which have lived in hypergravity (HG) had a lower number of PER suppressions than 1 g ones, and this finding was mainly due to young and middle-aged flies. In a second experiment, the habituation of the PER was studied using as stimulation sucrose solutions 2-fold (first experiment), 4-fold (second one) or 8-fold (third one) higher than the individual sucrose threshold. Middle-aged and old flies habituated more slowly than young flies in the second and third experiments. In the third experiment, a decreasing speed of habituation was observed when gravity increased; this result was mainly due to young flies, and no gravity effect was observed in the other two age groups. This whole set of results suggests that HG-kept flies do not age faster than 1 g ones, as far as these learning and habituation tasks are concerned. It seems possible that HG acts like a mild stress to which flies adapt; if applied for a long time, HG could induce a premature aging, as observed in the previous papers of this series.",1997,"N Minois, E Le Bourg, N Minois, E Le Bourg"
"Mutation of a gene for a Drosophila kinesin-like protein, Klp38B, leads to failure of cytokinesis",9152020,,"Mutations in a gene (Klp38B) encoding a novel kinesin-like protein in Drosophila melanogaster lead to the formation of polyploid cells in the larval central nervous system and in the follicle cells of adult egg chambers. Some homozygous mutants survive to adulthood and also exhibit morphological defects indicative of abnormal cell cycle progression, including rough eyes, missing bristles, and abnormal abdominal cuticles. In larval brains, there is no accumulation of mitotic cells and the frequency of anaphase figures is comparable to wild type, suggesting that nuclear division is not affected. Such brains contain polyploid cells with metaphase and anaphase chromosomes associated with bipolar spindles. Such spindles have a number of unseparated centrosomes at their poles reflecting the degree of polyploidy of the cell. Follicle cells frequently contain two nuclei of roughly equal size. Taken together, we conclude that these Klp38B mutations lead to a failure of cytokinesis resulting in polyploidy, and discuss whether or not this is a direct effect of the mutation.",1997,"H Ohkura, T TÃ¶rÃ¶k, G Tick, J Hoheisel, I Kiss, D M Glover, H Ohkura, T TÃ¶rÃ¶k, G Tick, J Hoheisel, I Kiss, D M Glover"

Deletion analysis of the promoter region suggests that the minimal promoter necessary for efficient expression of the gene is located between -138 (PstI) and +278 relative to the tsp. Within this minimal promoter region, at least two downstream regulatory elements responsible for the stimulation of gene expression seem to exist in the DNA fragments between +44 and +121 and between +214 and +278. Among these, the DNA fragment between +44 and +121 affects promoter activity more dramatically (about 6-7 fold).

"Acquisition and amplification of a testis-expressed autosomal gene, SSL, by the Drosophila Y chromosome",9177211,10.1073/pnas.94.12.6297,"The acquisition of autosomal fertility genes has been proposed to be an important process in human Y chromosome evolution. For example, the Y-linked fertility factor DAZ (Deleted in Azoospermia) appears to have arisen after the transposition and tandem amplification of the autosomal DAZH gene. The Drosophila melanogaster Y chromosome contains tandemly repeated Su(Ste) units that are thought to affect male fertility as suppressors of the homologous X-linked Stellate repeats. Here we report the detection of a testis-expressed autosomal gene, SSL [Su(Ste)-like], that appears to be an ancestor of the Y-linked Su(Ste) units. SSL encodes a casein kinase 2 (CK2) beta-subunit-like protein. Its putative ORF shares extensive (45%) homology with the genuine beta-subunit of CK2 and retains the conserved C-terminal and Glu/Asp-rich domains that are essential for CK2 holoenzyme regulation. SSL maps within region 60D1-2 of D. melanogaster and D. simulans polytene chromosomes. We present evidence that SSL was derived from the genuine betaCK2 gene by reverse transcription. This event resulted in the loss of the first three introns in the coding region of the SSL ancestor gene. Evolutionary analysis indicates that SSL has evolved under selective pressure at the translational level. Its sequence, especially in the 3' region, is much closer to the Y-linked Su(Ste) tandem repeats than to the betaCK2 gene.

Genetics of a pheromonal difference affecting sexual isolation between Drosophila mauritiana and D. sechellia,9093854,,"Females of the sibling species Drosophila sechellia and D. mauritiana differ in their cuticular hydrocarbons: the predominant compound in D. sechellia is 7,11-heptacosadiene (7,11-HD), while that in D. mauritiana is 7-tricosene (7-T). We investigate the genetic basis of this difference and its involvement in reproductive isolation between the species. Behavioral studies involving hydrocarbon transfer suggest that these compounds play a large role in the sexual isolation between D. mauritiana males and D. sechellia females, while sexual isolation in the reciprocal hybridization results more from differences in female behavior than hydrocarbons. This interspecific difference in hydrocarbon profile is due to evolutionary change at a minimum of six loci, all on the third chromosome. The localization of evolutionary change to the third chromosome has been seen in very other genetic analysis of female hydrocarbon differences in the D. melanogaster group. We suggest that the high 7,11-HD phenotype seen in two species evolved twice independently from ancestors having the high 7-T phenotype and the recurrent third-chromosome effects are evolutionary convergences that may be due to a concentration of ""hydrocarbon genes"" on that chromosome.",1997,"J A Coyne, B Charlesworth, J A Coyne, B Charlesworth"

The neuropeptide cardioacceleratory peptide 2b (CAP2b) has been previously shown to stimulate fluid secretion in this epithelium by elevating intracellular cGMP levels. Therefore, it was of interest to investigate if CAP2b acts through NO in isolated tubules and thus presumably through stimulation of a tubule NO synthase (NOS). We show here by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction that Drosophila NOS (dNOS) is expressed in Malpighian tubules. Biochemical assays of NOS activity in whole tubules show that CAP2b significantly stimulates NOS activity. Additionally, fluid secretion and cyclic nucleotide assays show that CAP2b-induced elevation of intracellular cGMP levels and fluid secretion rates are dependent on the activation of a soluble guanylate cyclase. Treatment of tubules with a specific NOS inhibitor abolishes the CAP2b-induced rise in intracellular cGMP levels. These data indicate that CAP2b stimulates NOS and therefore, endogenous NO production, which, in turn, stimulates a soluble guanylate cyclase. This is the first demonstration of stimulation of an endogenous NOS by a defined peptide in Drosophila.",1997,"S A Davies, E J Stewart, G R Huesmann, N J Skaer, S H Maddrell, N J Tublitz, J A Dow, S A Davies, E J Stewart, G R Huesmann, N J Skaer, S H Maddrell, N J Tublitz, J A Dow"
Corneal lens secretion in newly emerged Drosophila melanogaster examined by electron microscope autoradiography,9279017,10.1093/oxfordjournals.jmicro.a023515,"Drosophila corneal lens secretion was studied by electron microscope autoradiography of [3H]amino acids (leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, proline and tyrosine) and [3H]sugars (glucosamine and mannose) in newly emerged flies. Ommatidial lenses were homogeneously labelled with both tracers at low levels, suggesting that lens materials turn over continuously after lens formation is completed. In contrast, ocellar lenses were heavily labelled, indicating that deposition of ocellar lens cuticle is still active at this stage. [3H]amino acids and [3H]sugars were deposited in distinct patterns in ocelli. Although over 90% of [3H] sugars remained, even after 3 h after application, within 1 micron of the apices of corneagenous cells associated with lens bases, [3H]amino acids distributed diffusely. There was an obvious gradient of [3H]sugars from center to periphery of the lens base, suggesting that structure of the corneal lens in dorsal ocelli is determined by spatially regulated secretion of chitin by corneagenous cells.",1997,"C S Yoon, K Hirosawa, E Suzuki, C S Yoon, K Hirosawa, E Suzuki"
[Recombination in Drosophila melanogaster males exposed at a thermoelectric power plant],9162685,,"For four years, genetic recombination was studied in Drosophila melanogaster males kept at a thermoelectric power station (TPS) in Moscow; a TPS located in another city district was taken for comparison in 1994. It was found that, in the experimental males, recombination frequency was two- to threefold higher than in the control flies. Temporal variations in recombination frequency during four years were not statistically significant. The data obtained at the two TPSs also did not significantly differ from each other. The considerable increase of the recombination frequency in Drosophila kept at the TPS may be considered an appropriate response to exposure to effective mutagens that were abundant in the TPS discharges.",1997,"L P Filatova, N Sh Lapteva, V A Shevchenko, L P Filatova, N Sh Lapteva, V A Shevchenko"
Secondary structure model of the RNA recognized by the reverse transcriptase from the R2 retrotransposable element,8990394,,"RNA transcripts corresponding to the 250-nt 3' untranslated region of the R2 non-LTR retrotransposable element are recognized by the R2 reverse transcriptase and are sufficient to serve as templates in the target DNA-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) reaction. The R2 protein encoded by the Bombyx mori R2 can recognize this region from both the B. mori and Drosophila melanogaster R2 elements even though these regions show little nucleotide sequence identity. A model for the RNA secondary structure of the 3' untranslated region of the D. melanogaster R2 retrotransposon was developed by sequence comparison of 10 species aided by free energy minimization. Chemical modification experiments are consistent with this prediction. A secondary structure model for the 3' untranslated region of R2 RNA from the R2 element from B. mori was obtained by a combination of chemical modification data and free energy minimization. These two secondary structure models, found independently, share several common sites. This study shows the utility of combining free energy minimization, sequence comparison, and chemical modification to model an RNA secondary structure.",1997,"D H Mathews, A R Banerjee, D D Luan, T H Eickbush, D H Turner, D H Mathews, A R Banerjee, D D Luan, T H Eickbush, D H Turner"

The results are consistent with the view that selection may be operating on various haplotypes which share the Thr-Gly length alleles encoding 17, 20 and 23 dipeptide pairs, and that the repeat itself may be the focus for selection. These conclusions lend support to a number of other population and behavioural investigations which have provided evidence that selection is acting on the Thr-Gly region. The linkage analysis was also used to infer an approximate mutation rate (mu) for the repeat, of 10(-5) < mu < 4 x 10(-5) per gamete per generation. Direct measurements of the mutation rate using the polymerase chain reaction in a pedigree analysis of tens of thousands of individuals do not contradict this value. Consequently, the Thr-Gly repeat does not have a mutation rate that is as high as some of the non-coding minisatellites, but it is several orders of magnitude higher than the nucleotide substitution rate. The implications of this elevated mutation rate for linkage disequilibria and selection are discussed.",1997,"E Rosato, A A Peixoto, R Costa, C P Kyriacou, E Rosato, A A Peixoto, R Costa, C P Kyriacou"

Effects of the alpha subunit on imidacloprid sensitivity of recombinant nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,9504393,10.1038/sj.bjp.0701618,"1. Imidacloprid is a new insecticide with selective toxicity for insects over vertebrates. Recombinant (alpha4beta2) chicken neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and a hybrid nicotinic AChR formed by co-expression of a Drosophila melanogaster neuronal alpha subunit (SAD) with the chicken beta2 subunit were heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes by nuclear injection of cDNAs. The agonist actions of imidacloprid and other nicotinic AChR ligands ((+)-epibatidine, (-)-nicotine and acetylcholine) were compared on both recombinant nicotinic AChRs by use of two-electrode, voltage-clamp electrophysiology. 2. Imidacloprid alone of the 4 agonists behaved as a partial agonist on the alpha4beta2 receptor; (+)-epibatidine, (-)-nicotine and acetylcholine were all full, or near full, agonists. Imidacloprid was also a partial agonist of the hybrid Drosophila SAD chicken beta2 receptor, as was (-)-nicotine, whereas (+)-epibatidine and acetylcholine were full agonists. 3. The EC50 of imidacloprid was decreased by replacing the chicken alpha4 subunit with the Drosophila SAD alpha subunit. This alpha subunit substitution also resulted in an increase in the EC50 for (+)-epibatidine, (-)-nicotine and acetylcholine. Thus, the Drosophila (SAD) alpha subunit contributes to the greater apparent affinity of imidacloprid for recombinant insect/vertebrate nicotinic AChRs. 4. Imidacloprid acted as a weak antagonist of ACh-mediated responses mediated by SADbeta2 hybrid receptors and as a weak potentiator of ACh responses mediated by alpha4beta2 receptors. This suggests that imidacloprid has complex effects upon these recombinant receptors, determined at least in part by the alpha subunit.",1998,"K Matsuda, S D Buckingham, J C Freeman, M D Squire, H A Baylis, D B Sattelle, K Matsuda, S D Buckingham, J C Freeman, M D Squire, H A Baylis, D B Sattelle"
Dissection of chromosome region 89A of Drosophila melanogaster by local transposition of P elements,9718674,10.1266/ggs.73.95,"In the chromosome region 89A of Drosophila melanogaster, a few meiotic genes have been suggested to exist besides c3G and rec. We carried out local mutagenesis using a strain carrying a P element-insertion (plwB) at 89A, and obtained new genetic variants. Two are female sterile mutations, an allele of the homeless locus (hls167) and a new mutation tibi (tbi), and three are lethal mutations at the serpent locus. The tbi mutation is a paternally-rescuable maternal-effect-lethal. Destabilization of the P elements revealed that these mutations were caused by P element-insertions, and produced 12 deletion lines. These lines were then used for systematic complementation test. The results showed that: (1) hls, tbi and at least three lethal genes in addition to c3G, rec and l(3)89Aa are located within the deletion of Df(3R)c3G2(89A2-3; 89A4-5); (2) the gene order is rec, tbi, hls (from centromere to telomere), and both c3G and l(3)89Aa are possibly located proximally. We cloned 117 kb of DNA from this region by plasmid rescue and chromosome walking, and mapped several of the breakpoints of the deletions.

Silent variation for the whole Acp26A region was slightly higher in African than in non-African populations, while for both genes nonsynonymous variation was similar in all populations studied. Based on Fst estimates no major genetic differentiation was detected between East and West Africa, while in general non-African populations were strongly differentiated from both African populations.

Analysis of the transcriptional activity of six genes in various inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster unexpectedly failed to show an increase in variability among individuals as they age and die.

Iron-regulatory protein-1 (IRP-1) is highly conserved in two invertebrate species--characterization of IRP-1 homologues in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans,9660175,10.1046/j.1432-1327.1998.2540230.x,"Iron-regulatory protein-1 (IRP-1) plays a dual role as a regulatory RNA-binding protein and as a cytoplasmic aconitase. When bound to iron-responsive elements (IRE), IRP-1 post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of mRNAs involved in iron metabolism. IRP have been cloned from several vertebrate species. Using a degenerate-primer PCR strategy and the screening of data bases, we now identify the homologues of IRP-1 in two invertebrate species, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. Comparative sequence analysis shows that these invertebrate IRP are closely related to vertebrate IRP, and that the amino acid residues that have been implicated in aconitase function are particularly highly conserved, suggesting that invertebrate IRP may function as cytoplasmic aconitases. Antibodies raised against recombinant human IRP-1 immunoprecipitate the Drosophila homologue expressed from the cloned cDNA. In contrast to vertebrates, two IRP-1 homologues (Drosophila IRP-1A and Drosophila IRP-1B), displaying 86% identity to each other, are expressed in D. melanogaster. Both of these homologues are distinct from vertebrate IRP-2. In contrast to the mammalian system where the two IRP (IRP-1 and IRP-2) are differentially expressed, Drosophila IRP-1A and Drosophila IRP-1B are not preferentially expressed in specific organs. The localization of Drosophila IRP-1A to position 94C1-8 and of Drosophila IRP-1B to position 86B3-6 on the right arm of chromosome 3 and the availability of an IRP-1 cDNA from C. elegans will facilitate a genetic analysis of the IRE/IRP system, thus opening a new avenue to explore this regulatory network.",1998,"M Muckenthaler, N Gunkel, D Frishman, A Cyrklaff, P Tomancak, M W Hentze, M Muckenthaler, N Gunkel, D Frishman, A Cyrklaff, P Tomancak, M W Hentze"

These data support the hypothesis that genotype x environment interactions have important influences on polygene expression, and some loci might be silent, or phenotypically neutral, under some conditions but play a large phenotypic role under others.

[Genotypic basis of low viability in vestigial mutants of Drosophila melanogaster],9879011,,"The role of a marker mutation and other genes in a decrease in viability was studied in the Drosophila melanogaster vg line. In flies of the C-S line, chromosome 2 was substituted by the homologous chromosome of the vg flies. In addition, the flies of the mutant phenotype with mutant genes partially or completely substituted by the wild-type C-S genes were obtained in saturating crosses C-S x vg. In the reciprocal variant of chromosome 2 substitution, the flies of the C-S phenotype with chromosomes 1, 3, and 4 from the vg line were obtained. Chromosome 2 of the vg line, introduced into C-S fly karyotype, proved to substantially reduce the heat resistance and life span of flies. In the case of reciprocal replacement (C-S line chromosome 2 substituted for the homologous chromosome of vg flies), a significant increase in viability was observed, which, however, never reached the level characteristic of the C-S line. As the vg genotype became saturated with C-S genes, the heat resistance and life span of flies increased substantially. However, even the complete saturation of mutant chromosomes with wild-type genes never resulted in the equal viability of vg and C-S flies. These data suggest that the low viability of the vg mutant is largely accounted for by the gene composition of the second chromosome and, primarily, by the presence of the vg gene. Nevertheless, there is evidence that, along with the pleiotropic effect of the marker mutation, other genes not linked to chromosome 2 are responsible for the studied physiological properties of the vg flies.",1998,"V N TotskiÄ­, N D Khaustova, L V Levchuk, S V Morgun, V N TotskiÄ­, N D Khaustova, L V Levchuk, S V Morgun"
The mutation rate and the distribution of mutational effects of viability and fitness in Drosophila melanogaster,9720284,,"The empirical distributions of the average viability and fitness of mutation accumulation lines of Drosophila melanogaster were analyzed using minimum distance estimation. Data come from two different experimental designs where mutations were allowed to accumulate: 1) in copies of chromosome II protected from natural selection and recombination (viability: Mukai et al., 1972; Ohnishi, 1977; fitness: Houle et al., 1992), 2) in inbred lines derived from the same isogenic stock (viability: FernÃ¡ndez & LÃ³pez-Fanjul, 1996; fitness: this paper). Information from all data sets converged, indicating that the mutational rates were small, about 1% for viability and 3% for fitness. For both traits, the rate of mutational decline appears to be smaller than suggested by previous studies (about one-fifth of the latter), the average mutational effect was neither severe nor very slight, ranging from -0.1 to -0.3, and the distribution of mutant effects was, at most, slightly leptokurtic. Therefore, the mutational load in natural populations is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than previously thought (as based upon analyses conditional to estimates of the mutational decline of viability or fitness that appear to be biased upward). Over 95% of the mutational variance of each trait was contributed by non-slightly deleterious mutations (absolute homozygous effect larger than 0.03 or 0.1, depending on the data set considered) occurring at a rate not higher than 0.025 per haploid genome and generation.

Parental strains, F1 , F1r (reciprocal), F2 , backcross, and backcross reciprocal generations were used in a line-cross (generation means) analysis. This analysis revealed both additive and epistatic effects as important determinants of variation in ovariole number when larvae were reared at 25Â°C. Maternal effects and maternal-by-progeny genetic interactions were not significant. These results are comparable to previous studies that document epistatic components as genetic determinants of ovariole number in D. melanogaster. Parallel studies on ovariole number in D. hibisci parental and hybrid generations (F1 and F1r ) reared as larvae at three temperatures (18Â°, 21.5Â°, and 25Â°C) showed environmental effects and genotype-by-environment interactions as significant influences on the phenotype. Maternal effects were present when temperature of larval development was considered and significant, nonlinear environmental effects were detected. Field collections of D. hibisci females showed that field conditions result in significant departure of ovariole number from comparable laboratory reared females. The significant epistatic genetic effects, genotype-by-environment interactions, and maternal effects indicate that the genetic architecture of traits, such as ovariole number, may be more complex than often acknowledged and thus may be compatible with Wright's view of a netlike relationship between the genome and complex characters (Wright 1968).",1998,"William T Starmer, Michal Polak, Larry L Wolf, J S F Barker, William T Starmer, Michal Polak, Larry L Wolf, J S F Barker"

Nonetheless, there is surprisingly little evidence for a negative impact, on any animal species, of a constant discrepancy between the environmental and endogenous periods. Male Drosophila melanogaster per mutants with altered circadian periods were compared to the wild type in two different LD schedules. Life span was used as a global index of physiological adaptation. The life span of the mutants was significantly reduced by up to 15% for the flies whose period differs most from that of the wild type. A reduction was observed even when flies were kept in an LD schedule fitting a mutant period. The LD schedule made no significant difference on its own, but the authors found evidence for an interaction between genotype and LD schedule in determining life span. These results are consistent with the importance of the circadian clock in maintaining internal temporal order independent of environmental cycles.

We have raised affinity-purified antibodies against a Des-1 fusion protein, and localized the Des-1 protein in Drosophila spermatocytes. We show that the Des- protein is colocalized with mitochondria throughout male meiosis, becoming intimately associated with mitochondria along the spindle apparatus during anaphase and telophase, and with the Nebenkern, or mitochondrial derivative, of the meiotic end products. In addition, a significant association of Des-1 with the contractile ring is observed during anaphase and telophase of meiosis.

Although potentially negative mitotic effects of flavonoids have been observed in model organisms, investigation into meiotic effects of flavonoids has been neglected. As flavonoids affect cell signalling and DNA replication, and because the flavonoid content of the human food supply is being increased, determining the effects of flavonoids on meiotic fidelity is important. Here, the effect of the human food supply's most prevalent flavonoid, quercetin, on the level of meiotic recombination and the amount of X and 4th chromosome non-disjunction in Drosophila melanogaster females was determined. This model organism was chosen since Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens share a remarkable number of commonalities in the meiotic processes of oogenesis and because genetic techniques allow a detailed analysis of meiotic processes in Drosophila. No significant effect on either non-disjunction levels or the percentage distribution of exchange bivalents was observed. A significant effect was observed on the number of offspring; F1 and F2 generations of flies raised on a quercetin diet produced over 10% more progeny than flies raised on a control diet.

A genetic and molecular analysis of an invectedDominant mutation in Drosophila melanogaster,9729772,10.1139/g98-026,"The invected gene of Drosophila melanogaster is a homeobox-containing gene that is closely related to engrailed. A dominant gain of function allele, invectedDominant, was derived from mutagenesis of a dominant allele of vestigial, In(2R)vgW. A careful analysis of the phenotype of invectedDominant shows that it is associated with a transformation of the anterior compartment of the wing to a posterior fate. This transformation is normally limited to the wing blade itself and does not involve the remaining tissues derived from the wing imaginal disc, including the wing hinge and dorsal thorax of the fly. The ectopic expression of invected protein associated with invectedDominant correlates spatially with the normal expression pattern of vestigial in the wing imaginal disc, suggesting that control elements of vestigial are driving ectopic invected expression. This was confirmed by sequence analysis that shows that the dominant vestigial activity was eliminated by a deletion that removes the 3' portion of the vestigial coding region. This leaves a gene fusion wherein the vestigial enhancer elements are still juxtaposed immediately 5' to the invected transcriptional start site, but with the vg sequences harboring an additional lesion. Unlike recessive invected alleles, the invectedDominant allele produces an observable phenotype, and as such should prove useful in determining the role of invected in patterning the wing imaginal disc. Genetic analysis has shown that mutations of polyhomeotic, a gene involved in regulating engrailed expression, cause a reproducible alteration in the invectedDominant phenotype. Finally, the invectedDominant allele should prove valuable for identifying and characterizing genes that are activated within the posterior compartment.

"Amyrel, a paralogous gene of the amylase gene family in Drosophila melanogaster and the Sophophora subgenus",9618501,10.1073/pnas.95.12.6848,"We describe a gene from Drosophila melanogaster related to the alpha-amylase gene Amy. This gene, which exists as a single copy, was named Amyrel. It is strikingly divergent from Amy because the amino acid divergence is 40%. The coding sequence is interrupted by a short intron at position 655, which is unusual in amylase genes. Amyrel has also been cloned in Drosophila ananassae, Drosophila pseudoobscura, and Drosophila subobscura and is likely to be present throughout the Sophophora subgenus, but, to our knowledge, it has not been detected outside. Unexpectedly, there is a strong conservation of 5' and 3' flanking regions between Amyrel genes from different species, which is not the case for Amy and which suggests that selection acts on these regions. In contrast to the Amy genes, Amyrel is transcribed in larvae of D. melanogaster but not in adults. However, the protein has not been detected yet. Amyrel evolves about twice as fast as Amy in the several species studied. We suggest that this gene could result from a duplication of Amy followed by accelerated and selected divergence toward a new adaptation.",1998,"J L Da Lage, E Renard, F Chartois, F Lemeunier, M L Cariou"
Polygenic mutation in Drosophila melanogaster: genotype x environment interaction for spontaneous mutations affecting bristle number,9720280,,"A highly inbred line of Drosophila melanogaster was subdivided into replicate sublines that were subsequently maintained independently with 10 pairs of parents per generation. The parents were randomly sampled for 19 'unselected' sublines and artificially selected for high or low abdominal or sternopleural bristle number for 12 'selected' sublines (with 3 replicate selection lines/trait/direction of selection). Divergence in mean bristle number among the unselected sublines, and response of the selected sublines to selection, are attributable to the accumulation of new mutations affecting bristle number. The input of mutational variance per generation, VM, can be estimated from the magnitude of response or divergence, assuming neutrality of mutations affecting the bristle traits. We reared unselected lines at generations 222 and 224, and selected lines at generations 182-184 of mutation accumulation at each of three temperatures (18 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 28 degrees C), and estimated the mutational variance common to all environments and the mutational variance from genotype x environment interaction. For sternopleural bristle number, the mutational interaction variance was 26% of the mutational variance common to all temperatures, and the interaction variance was due to temperature x line interaction. For abdominal bristle number, the mutational interaction variance was 142% of the mutational variance common to all temperatures, and the interaction variance was due to interactions of temperature x line, sex x line, and temperature x sex x line. It is possible that segregating variation for bristle number is maintained partly by genotype x environment interaction, but information on the fitness profiles of mutations affecting bristle number in each environment will be necessary to evaluate this hypothesis quantitatively.",1998,"T F Mackay, R F Lyman, T F Mackay, R F Lyman"
Immunological confirmation of elevated levels of CuZn superoxide dismutase protein in an artificially selected long-lived strain of Drosophila melanogaster,9615921,10.1016/s0531-5565(97)00095-8,"Oxidative stress-induced damage is a major causal factor leading to the loss of function characteristic of the aging process. Various antioxidant defenses are marshalled by the organism so as to combat this oxidative damage and delay the onset of senscence. CuZnSOD is one of the major antioxidant enzymes and has been shown to play an important role in the extended longevity of Drosophila melanogaster. Although assays exist with which to measure the CuZnSOD RNA prevalence and enzyme activity, there existed no antibodies that permitted the measurement of the actual amount of Drosophila enzyme protein present. Development of such a tool would enhance our ability to understand mechanisms of antioxidant gene expression in this organism. We have developed a polyclonal antibody against synthetic SOD peptides that is specific for Drosophila CuZnSOD as shown by Western blots. It is very sensitive when tested against native Drosophila CuZnSOD protein. Its use in our experimental system confirms the prior RNA and enzyme activity measurements that indicate that our genetically selected long-lived strain has significantly higher levels of CuZnSOD protein than does the appropriate control strain.",1998,"R Hari, V Burde, R Arking, R Hari, V Burde, R Arking"
Effects of stress combinations on the expression of additive genetic variation for fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster,9802258,10.1017/s0016672398003310,"To test whether stressful conditions altered levels of heritable variation in fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster, parent-offspring comparisons were undertaken across three generations for flies reared in a combined stress (ethanol, cold shock, low nutrition) environment or a control environment. The stressful conditions did not directly influence fecundity but did lead to a reduced fecundity in the offspring generations, perhaps reflecting cross-generation maternal effects. Both the heritability and evolvability estimates were higher in the combined stress treatment, reflecting an apparent increase in the additive genetic variance under stress. In contrast, there were no consistent changes in the environmental variance across environments.",1998,"C M SgrÃ², A A Hoffmann, C M SgrÃ², A A Hoffmann"
The vestigial gene of Drosophila melanogaster is involved in the formation of the peripheral nervous system: genetic interactions with the scute gene,10197159,10.3109/01677069809167258,"The vestigial (vg) gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a novel nuclear protein which is required for wing formation but its function is not restricted to this developmental process. In this report, we have examined the possible role of vestigial in the formation of the peripheral nervous system. We found that most vestigial mutants display ectopic or missing macrochaetae. We also show that vestigial interacts in a dose dependant manner with different alleles of the scute gene and with the extramacrochaetae gene and that mis-expression of the vestigial gene in the wing disc increases the domain of scute expression and allows the formation of supernumerary ectopic bristles. From these results, we conclude that vestigial affects scute expression and plays a role in the differentiation of the peripheral nervous system.",1998,"A Zider, S Paumard-Rigal, I Frouin, J Silber, A Zider, S Paumard-Rigal, I Frouin, J Silber"
Scythe: a novel reaper-binding apoptotic regulator,9799223,10.1093/emboj/17.21.6135,"Reaper is a central regulator of apoptosis in Drosophila melanogaster. With no obvious catalytic activity or homology to other known apoptotic regulators, reaper's mechanism of action has been obscure. We recently reported that recombinant Drosophila reaper protein induced rapid mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase activation and apoptotic nuclear fragmentation in extracts of Xenopus eggs. We now report the purification of a 150 kDa reaper-interacting protein from Xenopus egg extracts, which we have named Scythe. Scythe is highly conserved among vertebrates and contains a ubiquitin-like domain near its N-terminus. Immunodepletion of Scythe from extracts completely prevented reaper-induced apoptosis without affecting apoptosis triggered by activated caspases. Moreover, a truncated variant of Scythe lacking the N-terminal domain induced apoptosis even in the absence of reaper. These data suggest that Scythe is a novel apoptotic regulator that is an essential component in the pathway of reaper-induced apoptosis.",1998,"K Thress, W Henzel, W Shillinglaw, S Kornbluth, K Thress, W Henzel, W Shillinglaw, S Kornbluth"
