Functional analysis of dynamin isoforms in Drosophila melanogaster,10928214,10.3109/01677069909083470,"Dynamin and dynamin-like proteins are required for endocytosis, synaptic vesicle recycling and membrane trafficking. From the shibire locus in Drosophila melanogaster, six different isoforms of dynamin are generated by alternative splicing. However, the roles of the individual isoforms in cellular processes are unknown. To investigate functional differences among the dynamin isoforms, transgenic lines were generated that individually expressed each of 3 different isoforms under UASGAL4 control. The expression of the isoforms was controlled by neural promoter (elav)-driven GAL4, or by a shibire-promoter driven GAL4 transgene. Reporter gene expression indicated that the shi promoter is active during embryogenesis, and in larvae, pupae, and adults in a pattern consistent with normal dynamin expression. To assay for the ability of dynamin isoforms to function in vivo, the isoforms expressed via these GAL4 drivers were tested for the ability to rescue shibire phenotypes. When expressed at very high levels all individual isoforms tested rescued the temperature-sensitive paralytic phenotype of shi(ts2) flies; however, this rescue was partial, suggesting that no single tested isoform is sufficient for synaptic vesicle recycling in vivo. When tested for ability to rescue lethality induced by heat-pulsing larvae during development, shi- promoter driven expression of individual isoforms conferred significant resistance to heat treatment during larval development. However, all 3 isoforms were unable to rescue the lethality of shi12-12B mutants which are severely hypomorphic (or null) for shibire function. Taken together, these observations suggest that individual shibire isoforms have specific molecular activities in vivo.",1999,"R R Staples, M Ramaswami, R R Staples, M Ramaswami"
Temporal pattern of locomotor activity in Drosophila melanogaster,10077864,10.1007/s003590050307,"The temporal pattern of locomotor activity of single Drosophila melanogaster flies freely walking in small tubes is described. Locomotor activity monitored by a light gate has a characteristic time-course that depends upon age and the environmental conditions. Several methods are applied to assess the complexity of the temporal pattern. The pattern varies according to sex, genotype, age and environmental conditions (food; light). Activity occurs clustered in bouts. The intrinsic bout structure is quantified by four parameters: number of light gate passages (counts) per bout, duration of a bout, pause between two successive bouts and mean bout period. In addition, the distribution of the periods between light-gate crossings (inter-count intervals) as function of inter-count interval duration reveals a power law, suggesting that the overall distribution of episodes of activity and inactivity has a fractal structure. In the dark without food, the fractal dimension which represents a measure of the complexity of the pattern is sex, genotype and age specific. Fractality is abolished by additional sensory stimulation (food; light). We propose that time-course, bout structure and fractal dimension of the temporal pattern of locomotor activity describe different aspects of the fly's central pattern generator for locomotion and its motivational control.",1999,"J R Martin, R Ernst, M Heisenberg, J R Martin, R Ernst, M Heisenberg"
Recent selection on synonymous codon usage in Drosophila,10473775,10.1007/pl00006557,"Evidence from a variety of sources indicates that selection has influenced synonymous codon usage in Drosophila. It has generally been difficult, however, to distinguish selection that acted in the distant past from ongoing selection. However, under a neutral model, polymorphisms usually reflect more recent mutations than fixed differences between species and may, therefore, be useful for inferring recent selection. If the ancestral state is preferred, selection should shift the frequency distribution of derived states/site toward lower values; if the ancestral is unpreferred, selection should increase the number of derived states/site. Polymorphisms were classified as ancestrally preferred or unpreferred for several genes of D. simulans and D. melanogaster. A computer simulation of coalescence was employed to derive the expected frequency distributions of derived states/site under various modifications of the Wright-Fisher neutral model, and distributions of test statistics (t and Mann-Whitney U) were derived by appropriate sampling. One-tailed tests were applied to transformed frequency data to assess whether the two frequency distributions deviated from neutral expectations in the direction predicted by selection on codon usage. Several genes from D. simulans appear to be subject to recent selection on synonymous codons, including one gene with low codon bias, esterase-6. Selection may also be acting in D. melanogaster.",1999,"R M Kliman, R M Kliman"
Chromosomal homologies between Drosophila melanogaster and D. funebris determined by in-situ hybridization,10515208,10.1023/a:1009207812569,"Seventeen biotin-labeled DNA sequences were hybridized to polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster and D. funebris in order to establish chromosomal homologies between these species.

The probes were chosen in order to cover all the autosomes, since X-chromosome homologies have already been studied by linkage analysis of morphological mutants. Most probes gave a unique hybridization signal; consequently, our results allow unambiguous inferences about chromosomal homologies. The results show extensive gene rearrangement within all chromosomal elements, probably due to paracentric inversions, but are consistent with Muller's proposal that chromosomal elements have conserved their genetic content during the evolution of Drosophila.",1999,"P Gallego, E Juan, M Papaceit"
Nuclear entry of the Drosophila melanogaster nuclear lamina protein YA correlates with developmentally regulated changes in its phosphorylation state,10364432,10.1006/dbio.1999.9264,"The Drosophila melanogaster YA protein is a maternally provided nuclear lamina component that is essential during the transition from meiosis to mitosis at the beginning of embryogenesis. Localization of YA to the nuclear envelope is required for its function; this localization is cell cycle-dependent during embryogenesis. Here we show that the ability of YA to enter nuclei is modulated during development. In developing egg chambers, YA protein is made but excluded from nuclei of nurse cells and oocytes; upon egg activation, YA acquires the ability to enter nuclei and becomes incorporated into the nuclear lamina in unfertilized eggs and embryos. This localization switch correlates with changes in the phosphorylation state of YA. YA in ovaries is hyperphosphorylated relative to YA in unfertilized eggs and embryos. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we identified 443T, a potential phosphorylation site for both cyclin-dependent protein kinase and mitogen-activated-protein kinase, as one of the sites likely involved in this developmental control. Our results suggest that phosphorylation plays a role in modulating the localization of YA during development. A model for developmental regulation of the nuclear entry of YA is proposed and implications for understanding Drosophila egg activation are discussed.",1999,"J Yu, J Liu, K Song, S G Turner, M F Wolfner, J Yu, J Liu, K Song, S G Turner, M F Wolfner"
Genetic localization of a Drosophila melanogaster resistance gene to a parasitoid wasp and physical mapping of the region,10330127,,"Drosophila melanogaster larvae usually react against eggs of the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi by surrounding them with a multicellular melanotic capsule. The genetic determinism of this response has been studied previously using susceptible (non-capsule-forming) and resistant (capsule-forming) strains. The results suggest that differences in their encapsulation response involve a single gene, resistance to Leptopilina boulardi (Rlb), with two alleles, the resistant one being dominant. Rlb confers specific protection against Leptopilina boulardi and is thus probably involved in parasitoid recognition. Recent studies have localized this gene on the right arm of the second chromosome and our aim was to precisely determine its genetic and molecular location. Using strains bearing deletions, we demonstrated that resistance to Leptopilina boulardi is conferred by the 55C; 55F3 region and that the 55E2-E6; F3 region is particularly involved. A physical map of the 55C; 56A region was then constructed, based on a set of overlapping cosmid and P1 phage clones.

The Goodwin oscillator: on the importance of degradation reactions in the circadian clock,10643743,10.1177/074873099129001037,"This article focuses on the Goodwin oscillator and related minimal models, which describe negative feedback schemes that are of relevance for the circadian rhythms in Neurospora, Drosophila, and probably also in mammals. The temperature behavior of clock mutants in Neurospora crassa and Drosophila melanogaster are well described by the Goodwin model, at least on a semi-quantitative level. A similar semi-quantitative description has been found for Neurospora crassa phase response curves with respect to moderate temperature pulses, heat shock pulses, and pulses of cycloheximide. A characteristic feature in the Goodwin and related models is that degradation of clock-mRNA and clock protein species plays an important role in the control of the oscillator's period. As predicted by this feature, recent experimental results from Neurospora crassa indicate that the clock (FRQ) protein of the long period mutant frq7 is degraded approximately twice as slow as the corresponding wild-type protein. Quantitative RT-PCR indicates that experimental frq7-mRNA concentrations are significantly higher than wild-type levels. The latter findings cannot be modeled by the Goodwin oscillator. Therefore, a threshold inhibition mechanism of transcription is proposed.",1999,"P Ruoff, M Vinsjevik, C Monnerjahn, L Rensing, P Ruoff, M Vinsjevik, C Monnerjahn, L Rensing"
Molecular characterization of the 5' control region and of two lethal alleles affecting the hsp60 gene in Drosophila melanogaster,10456322,10.1016/s0014-5793(99)00963-1,"The chaperonins are evolutionarily conserved essential cellular proteins that help folding newly synthesized or translocated proteins, spending ATP. We present here the molecular analysis of the hsp60 gene promoter region and of two Drosophila hsp60 ethyl methane sulfonate embryonic lethal alleles that have an identical phenotype. No heat shock element sequences were found in the 5' region, supporting previous data (Kozlova, T. et al., 1997) which suggests that mitochondrial Drosophila melanogaster HSP60.1 is not heat inducible. By sequencing the lethal allele's entire open reading frame (ORF), we found a C-T transition in the hsp60F409 allele that produces a serine to leucine change, apparently distorting the protein equatorial domain structure. No changes were found in the hsp60G93 ORF. However, an analysis of the heterogeneous nuclear RNA levels showed a reduction of the hsp60 transcript in hsp60G93 flies as compared to the wild-type. These data suggest that although the defects in the hsp60 gene produced by these alleles are at different levels, both behave as null mutations.",1999,"L Perezgasga, L Segovia, M Zurita, L Perezgasga, L Segovia, M Zurita"
"Genetic and molecular characterization of sting, a gene involved in crystal formation and meiotic drive in the male germ line of Drosophila melanogaster",9927466,,"The sting mutation, caused by a P element inserted into polytene region 32D, was isolated by a screen for male sterile insertions in Drosophila melanogaster. This sterility is correlated with the presence of crystals in spermatocytes and spermatids that are structurally indistinguishable from those produced in males carrying a deficiency of the Y-linked crystal (cry) locus. In addition, their morphology is needle-like in Ste+ flies and star-shaped in Ste flies, once again as observed in cry- males. The sti mutation leads to meiotic drive of the sex chromosomes, and the strength of the phenomenon is correlated with the copy number of the repetitive Ste locus. The same correlation is also true for the penetrance of the male sterile mutation. A presumptive sti null allele results in male sterility and lethal maternal effect. The gene was cloned and shown to code for a putative protein that is 866 amino acids long. A C-terminal domain of 82 amino acids is identified that is well conserved in proteins from different organisms. The gene is expressed only in the germline of both sexes. The interaction of sting with the Ste locus can also be demonstrated at the molecular level. While an unprocessed 8-kb Ste primary transcript is expressed in wild-type males, in X/Y homozygous sti males, as in X/Y cry- males, a 0.7-kb mRNA is produced.",1999,"A Schmidt, G Palumbo, M P Bozzetti, P Tritto, S Pimpinelli, U SchÃ¤fer, A Schmidt, G Palumbo, M P Bozzetti, P Tritto, S Pimpinelli, U SchÃ¤fer"
A comparison of Hsp70 expression and thermotolerance in adults and larvae of three Drosophila species,10590838,10.1379/1466-1268(1999)004<0243:acohea>2.3.co;2,"Heat shock proteins (Hsps) and other molecular chaperones perform diverse physiological roles. One is to facilitate, in part, organismal thermotolerance, of which the functional consequences depend on Hsp70 concentration and developmental stage in Drosophila melanogaster. To test whether an Hsp70-thermotolerance relationship is a general phenomenon within Drosophila, I assayed Hsp70 concentration at a range of temperatures in intact larvae and adults of three species, D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. mojavensis, and compared those results to the increase in survival to heat shock that occurs after an Hsp70 inducing pretreatment. Larvae of D. melanogaster and D. simulans responded similarly to heat; they expressed Hsp70 maximally at 36-37 degrees C, and their tolerance of 1 h heat shocks increased by 1.5-2 degrees C. By contrast, D. mojavensis, which tolerates higher temperatures than do D. melanogaster and D. simulans, expressed Hsp70 only at higher temperatures, although the 36 degrees C pretreatment still increased thermotolerance. Critically, the temperature that maximally induced Hsp70 was a poor inducer of thermotolerance in D. mojavensis and may have harmed larvae. Results for Drosophila adults, which tolerated heat poorly compared to larvae, likewise suggest that a close link between peak Hsp70 expression and maximal induction of thermotolerance is a feature of D. melanogaster, and not of the other species. Neither D. simulans nor D. mojavensis adults increased tolerance after exposure to the temperatures that maximally induced Hsp70.",1999,R A Krebs
Role of posttranscriptional regulation in circadian clocks: lessons from Drosophila,10442235,10.3109/07420529908998716,"Incredible progress has been made in the last few years in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying circadian clocks. Many of the recent insights have been gained by the isolation and characterization of novel clock mutants and their associated gene products. As might be expected based on theoretical considerations and earlier studies that indicated the importance of temporally regulated macromolecular synthesis for the manifestation of overt rhythms, daily oscillations in the levels of ""clock"" RNAs and proteins are a pervasive feature of these timekeeping devices. How are these molecular rhythms generated and synchronized? Recent evidence accumulated from a wide variety of model organisms, ranging from bacteria to mammals, points toward an emerging trend; at the ""heart"" of circadian oscillators lies a cell autonomous transcriptional feedback loop that is composed of alternatively functioning positive and negative elements. Nonetheless, it is also clear that to bring this transcriptional feedback loop to ""life"" requires important contributions from posttranscriptional regulatory schemes. For one thing, there must be times in the day when the activities of negative-feedback regulators are separated from the activities of the positive regulators they act on, or else the oscillatory potential of the system will be dissipated, resulting in a collection of molecules at steady state. This review mainly summarizes the role of posttranscriptional regulation in the Drosophila melanogaster time-keeping mechanism. Accumulating evidence from Drosophila and other systems suggests that posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms increase the dynamic range of circadian transcriptional feedback loops, overlaying them with appropriately timed biochemical constraints that not only engender these loops with precise daily periods of about 24 h, but also with the ability to integrate and respond rapidly to multiple environmental cues such that their phases are aligned optimally to the prevailing external conditions.",1999,"I Edery, I Edery"

Here, we show that the product of the ecdysteroid-inducible gene Fbp-1 (Fat Body Protein 1) is the receptor that binds LSP-1. Transcription and translation of Fbp-1 is stage-specifically restricted to the end of the third larval instar, starting around 99 h after egg laying. Expression of Fbp-1 is induced by a low level of 20-hydroxy-ecdysone (>/= 10-7 m). After translation, the FBP-1 protein is thought to be proteolytically cleaved in three subsequent steps. The final cleavage step is delayed by 6 h and relies on a higher concentration of ecdysone (>/= 10-5 m). Therefore, 20-hydroxy-ecdysone regulates Fbp-1 expression and function at two different levels. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to date to demonstrate two distinct functions for different concentrations of a steroid hormone on a single biochemical process.",1999,"T Burmester, C Antoniewski, J A Lepesant, T Burmester, C Antoniewski, J A Lepesant"
The role of rho family GTPases in development: lessons from Drosophila melanogaster,10356356,10.1006/mcbr.1999.0119,"It has become increasingly clear in the last few years that the Rho family GTPases regulate cytoskeleton rearrangements that are essential for a variety of morphogenetic events associated with the development of multicellular organisms. In particular, Drosophila has provided an excellent in vivo system for deciphering the signaling pathways mediated by Rho GTPases, as well as establishing the role of these pathways in numerous developmental processes. Continued use of this system will undoubtedly lead to the identification of additional Rho signalling components and information regarding the function and organization of the Rho signaling pathways in tissue morphogenesis. The striking similarity between Drosophila and mammalian Rho signaling components identified thus far indicates that the Rho pathways are highly conserved in evolution. Therefore, the findings from the Drosophila system can be extrapolated to higher organisms, including humans. Combined with the rapid progress in the human and Drosophila genome projects, these findings should contribute greatly to our understanding of mammalian Rho GTPase signaling pathways and their roles in normal development and pathological conditions.",1999,"Y Lu, J Settleman, Y Lu, J Settleman"
A genetic and molecular characterization of the garnet gene of Drosophila melanogaster,10659786,,"The garnet gene was one of the first genes to be identified in Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations in the garnet gene affect both of the biochemically distinct types of pigments in the eye and disrupt pigmentation of other organs. As an initial step in the analysis of this gene, we have analyzed the pigmentation defects in several of the garnet alleles. We have also cloned the gene and examined its expression in various tissues and at different stages of development. The garnet gene is expressed throughout development and in all tissues examined. Structurally related sequences can be detected in a variety of other eukaryotes. The predicted protein sequence of the garnet product resembles clathrin and nonclathrin adaptin proteins and is highly similar to the delta subunit of the newly isolated mammalian AP-3 adaptin complex, which is associated with the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. This suggests that garnet encodes a protein that acts in the intracellular sorting and trafficking of vesicles from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes, and related specialized organelles such as the pigment granule. This finding provides an explanation for the phenotype of garnet mutations and predicts that other Drosophila eye-colour genes will be a rich resource for the genetic dissection of intracellular vesicle transport.",1999,"V K Lloyd, D A Sinclair, R Wennberg, T S Warner, B M Honda, T A Grigliatti, V K Lloyd, D A Sinclair, R Wennberg, T S Warner, B M Honda, T A Grigliatti"

The reaction at low substrate concentrations was followed until the change of the absorbance became negligible and at high concentrations only initial parts were recorded. A simultaneous analysis of the progress curves using numerical integration showed that the powerful organophosphonate inhibitor binds and compete with the substrate for the same binding sites.

Nitric oxide and cyclic GMP induce vesicle release at Drosophila neuromuscular junction,10363907,10.1002/(sici)1097-4695(19990605)39:3<337::aid-neu1>3.0.co;2-9,"Nitric oxide (NO) diffuses as short-lived messenger through the plasma membrane and serves, among many other functions, as an activator of the cGMP synthesizing enzyme soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). In view of recent genetic investigations that postulated a retrograde signal from the larval muscle fibers to the presynaptic terminals, we looked for the presence of an NO/cGMP signaling system at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of Drosophila melanogaster larvae. Application of NO donors induced cGMP immunoreactivity in the presynaptic terminals but not the postsynaptic muscle fibers at an identified NMJ. The NO-induced cGMP immunoreactivity was sensitive to a specific inhibitor (ODQ) of the sGC. Since presynaptic terminals which were surgically isolated from the central nervous system are capable of synthesizing cGMP, we suggest that an NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase is present in the terminal arborizations. Using a fluorescent dye that is known to stain recycling synaptic vesicles, we demonstrate that NO donors and membrane permeant cGMP analogues cause vesicle release at the NMJ. Moreover, the NO-induced release could be blocked by the specific inhibitor of the sGC. A destaining of synaptic terminals after NO exposure in Ca2+-free solution in the presence of cobalt chloride as a channel blocker suggested that NO stimulates Ca2+-independent vesicle release at the NMJ. The combined immunocytochemical and exocytosis imaging experiments imply the involvement of cGMP and NO in the regulation of vesicle release at the NMJ of Drosophila larvae.",1999,"B Wildemann, G Bicker, B Wildemann, G Bicker"

Developmental regulation of granule size and numbers in larval salivary glands of drosophila by steroid hormone ecdysone,10736190,10.1006/cbir.1999.0433,"The size and number of secretory granules in late larval salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster have been related to interecdysial and early metamorphic development represented by well-known puffs in polytene chromosomes.

The transition from PSI to early metamorphic phase (PS2 and upwards), induced by rapid elevation in endogenous steroid hormone ecdysone, is accompanied by continuous growth of granule diameter with concomitant reduction in their number per cell. In the PS4, just prior to secretion, approximately 3000 mature granules occur per cell. The mature state is associated with the change from hyperbolic to Gaussian distribution of granule number over their size range. Similar changes in secretory granule parameters were observed in interecdysial salivary glands explanted from 3rd instar larvae and cultured in vitro in medium containing 5x10(-6) m ecdysone.",1999,"R Farkas, G SuÃ¡kovÃ¡, R Farkas, G SuÃ¡kovÃ¡"
The 3' end CCA of mature tRNA is an antideterminant for eukaryotic 3'-tRNase,10024176,10.1017/s1355838299981256,"Cytoplasmic tRNAs undergo posttranscriptional 5' and 3' end processing in the eukaryotic nucleus, and CCA (which forms the mature 3' end of all tRNAs) must be added by tRNA nucleotidyl transferase before tRNA can be aminoacylated and utilized in translation. Eukaryotic 3'-tRNase can endonucleolytically remove a 3' end trailer by cleaving on the 3' side of the discriminator base (the unpaired nucleotide 3' of the last base pair of the acceptor stem). This reaction proceeds despite a wide range in length and sequence of the 3' end trailer, except that mature tRNA containing the 3' terminal CCA is not a substrate for mouse 3'-tRNase (Nashimoto, 1997, Nucleic Acids Res 25:1148-1154). Herein, we extend this result with Drosophila and pig 3'-tRNase, using Drosophila melanogaster tRNAHis as substrate. Mature tRNA is thus prevented from recycling through 3' end processing. We also tested a series of tRNAs ending at the discriminator base (-), with one C added (+C), two Cs added (+CC), and CCA added (+CCA) as 3'-tRNase inhibitors. Inhibition was competitive with both Drosophila and pig 3'-tRNase. The product of the 3'-tRNase reaction (-) is a good 3'-tRNase inhibitor, with a KI approximately two times KM for the normal 3'-tRNase substrate. KI increases with each nucleotide added beyond the discriminator base, until when tRNA+CCA is used as inhibitor, KI is approximately forty times the substrate KM. The 3'-tRNase can thus remain free to process precursors with 3' end trailers because it is barely inhibited by tRNA+CCA, ensuring that tRNA can progress to aminoacylation. The active site of 3'-tRNase may have evolved to make an especially poor fit with tRNA+CCA.",1999,"A Mohan, S Whyte, X Wang, M Nashimoto, L Levinger, A Mohan, S Whyte, X Wang, M Nashimoto, L Levinger"

In this paper, we show that phenotypes of su(f) temperature-sensitive mutants result from a defect in cell proliferation. Analysis of the mitotic phenotype of su(f) temperature-sensitive alleles in larval brain and in imaginal discs reveals an increase in the number of metaphases with overcondensed chromosomes and asymmetric or reduced mitotic spindles. In contrast, neural differentiation in eye imaginal discs of the same mutant flies does not appear to be affected. These results indicate that su(f) is required during cell division for progression through metaphase.

A single-nucleotide difference in this gene that has been detected using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) is responsible for an hsr-omegaa/b polymorphism, and selection experiments have indicated an association between the hsr-omegaa allele and susceptibility to heat stress. Since allele frequency estimates for population surveys using PCR and DGGE for single flies would be relatively time-consuming and expensive, we here develop a quantitative competitive-PCR method using mass-grind genomic DNA preparations for this purpose. Geographical and temporal variation of allele frequency at the hsr-omega locus in Australian populations of D. melanogaster are examined. Regular samples from a southern population through a summer season suggested stability of hsr-omegaa frequency. Field populations sampled from a approximately 2,250 km north-south transect along eastern Australia revealed a strong positive association between the frequency of hsr-omegaa and latitude, and marked spatial autocorrelation. Using appropriate analyses, strong association between population differences in hsr-omegaa frequencies and differences in temperature and rainfall measures, after controlling for latitudinal differences, support the idea that the cline in hsr-omegaa frequency may be attributable to some form of climatic selection.",1999,"G McColl, S W McKechnie, G McColl, S W McKechnie"

To establish a system in which raft-dependent processes could be studied genetically, we have analyzed the protein and lipid composition of these microdomains in Drosophila melanogaster. Using mass spectrometry, we identified the phospholipids, sphingolipids, and sterols present in Drosophila membranes. Despite chemical differences between Drosophila and mammalian lipids, their structure suggests that the biophysical properties that allow raft formation have been preserved. Consistent with this, we have identified a detergent-insoluble fraction of Drosophila membranes that, like mammalian rafts, is rich in sterol, sphingolipids, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins. We show that the sterol-linked Hedgehog N-terminal fragment associates specifically with this detergent-insoluble membrane fraction. Our findings demonstrate that raft formation is preserved across widely separated phyla in organisms with different lipid structures. They further suggest sterol modification as a novel mechanism for targeting proteins to raft membranes and raise the possibility that signaling and polarized intracellular transport of Hedgehog are based on raft association.",1999,"A Rietveld, S Neutz, K Simons, S Eaton, A Rietveld, S Neutz, K Simons, S Eaton"

A highly conserved sequence in the 3'-untranslated region of the drosophila Adh gene plays a functional role in Adh expression,9927459,,"Phylogenetic analysis identified a highly conserved eight-base sequence (AAGGCTGA) within the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase gene, Adh. To examine the functional significance of this conserved motif, we performed in vitro deletion mutagenesis on the D. melanogaster Adh gene followed by P-element-mediated germline transformation. Deletion of all or part of the eight-base sequence leads to a twofold increase in in vivo ADH enzymatic activity. The increase in activity is temporally and spatially general and is the result of an underlying increase in Adh transcript. These results indicate that the conserved 3'-UTR motif plays a functional role in the negative regulation of Adh gene expression. The evolutionary significance of our results may be understood in the context of the amino acid change that produces the ADH-F allele and also leads to a twofold increase in ADH activity. While there is compelling evidence that the amino acid replacement has been a target of positive selection, the conservation of the 3'-UTR sequence suggests that it is under strong purifying selection. The selective difference between these two sequence changes, which have similar effects on ADH activity, may be explained by different metabolic costs associated with the increase in activity.",1999,"J Parsch, W Stephan, S Tanda, J Parsch, W Stephan, S Tanda"
Effects of aging on the acquisition and extinction of excitatory conditioning in Drosophila melanogaster,10477051,10.1016/s0031-9384(99)00058-x,"Young (7-day-old), middle-aged (28-day-old), and old (49-day-old) Drosophila melanogaster were compared for acquisition, then extinction, of excitatory conditioning of the Proboscis Extension Response. The contribution of nonassociative processes (sucrose-induced Central Excitatory State, Pseudoconditioning) in the elicitation of conditioned responses was simultaneously assessed. Old flies displayed a faster and stronger acquisition than middle-aged ones, whereas no significant acquisition was stated in young flies. The influence of nonassociative processes on the acquisition was of minor importance, even though Central Excitatory State increased with age. Old flies proved also to be the slowest to extinguish. Because nonassociative contamination was not involved during extinction, one may wonder whether extinction was delayed in old flies mainly due to a higher level of acquisition or to a behavioral rigidity.",1999,"N Fresquet, N Fresquet"

A head cDNA for the Drosophila IP3R has previously been cloned and sequenced. Here we present and analyse the sequence of cDNAs encoding the complete IP3R, obtained from embryonic stages. The embryonic cDNA is 10525bp long and is a splice variant of the head cDNA. It differs from the latter in three main respects. It has longer 5' and 3' untranslated regions, two potential casein kinase II sites are missing in the embryo form and it contains an alternate exon which results in the replacement of three residues (VHF) in the head form by five residues (GVGHSV) in the embryo form. The significance of these changes is discussed. An exon-intron map of the gene derived from sequencing of intron-containing genomic fragments is also presented.

Osmoregulation in Drosophila melanogaster selected for urea tolerance,10441086,,"Animals may adapt to hyperosmolar environments by either osmoregulating or osmoconforming. Osmoconforming animals generally accumulate organic osmolytes including sugars, amino acids or, in a few cases, urea. In the latter case, they also accumulate 'urea-counteracting' solutes to mitigate the toxic effects of urea. We examined the osmoregulatory adaptation of Drosophila melanogaster larvae selected to live in 300 mmol l(-)(1) urea. Larvae are strong osmoregulators in environments with high NaCl or sucrose levels, but have increased hemolymph osmolarity on urea food. The increase in osmolarity on urea food is smaller in the selected larvae relative to unselected control larvae, and their respective hemolymph urea concentrations can account for the observed increases in total osmolarity. No other hemolymph components appear to act as urea-counteractants. Urea is calculated to be in equilibrium across body compartments in both selected and control larvae, indicating that the selected larvae are not sequestering it to lower their hemolymph osmolarity. The major physiological adaptation to urea does not appear to involve increased tolerance or improved osmoregulation per se, but rather mechanisms (e.g. metabolism, decreased uptake or increased excretion) that reduce overall urea levels and the consequent toxicity.",1999,"V A Pierce, L D Mueller, A G Gibbs, V A Pierce, L D Mueller, A G Gibbs"

In the present study, three cAMP-dependent phosphoproteins (referred to as pp45, pp20, and pp10) were detected in the lumen fluid of male accessory glands. They were tissue-specific secretory proteins that accumulated only after eclosion, and were transferred to females during mating as other secretory proteins of the accessory glands. Among them, the 45-kDa phosphoprotein was partially purified and characterized. The purified protein was phosphorylated in vitro by the catalytic subunit of PKA.

The haplolethal region at the 16F gene cluster of Drosophila melanogaster: structure and function,9872957,,"Extensive aneuploid analyses had shown the existence of a few haplolethal (HL) regions and one triplolethal region in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Since then, only two haplolethals, 22F1-2 and 16F, have been directly linked to identified genes, dpp and wupA, respectively. However, with the possible exception of dpp, the actual bases for this dosage sensitivity remain unknown. We have generated and characterized dominant-lethal mutations and chromosomal rearrangements in 16F and studied them in relation to the genes in the region. This region extends along 100 kb and includes at least 14 genes. The normal HL function depends on the integrity of a critical 4-kb window of mostly noncoding sequences within the wupA transcription unit that encodes the muscle protein troponin I (TNI). All dominant lethals are breakpoints within that window, which prevent the functional expression of TNI and other adjacent genes in the proximal direction. However, independent mutations in these genes result in recessive lethal phenotypes only. We propose that the HL at 16F represents a long-range cis regulatory region that acts upon a number of functionally related genes whose combined haploidy would yield the dominant-lethal effect.",1999,"A Prado, I Canal, A FerrÃºs, A Prado, I Canal, A FerrÃºs"

The ability of the older males to habituate to the attractive signals given off by the younger males is a dopaminergic-modulated experience-dependent modification of behavior that is abolished with increasing age. Dopamine-depleted females show increased resistance to copulation; 20-day-old females demonstrated an increase in copulation avoidance compared with younger (5-15-day-old) females. These changes in dopaminergic-modulated behaviors observed during aging parallel declines in whole body levels of dopamine. Immunocytochemical analysis of adult brains using an antibody raised against Drosophila tyrosine hydroxylase to visualize catecholaminergic cell bodies revealed increased degeneration of the cell bodies with aging.

The lethal mutations have been mapped to deficiencies that span the 44D-45B region, producing an approximate map position for each complementation group. Lethal mutations were analyzed to determine the phase of development at which lethality occurred. In addition, we have linked some of the complementation groups to P element-induced lethals that map to 44D-45B, thus possibly providing new alleles of a previously tagged gene. Some of the complementation groups represent potentially novel alleles of previously identified genes that map to the region. Several genes have been mapped by molecular means to the 44D-45B region, but do not have any reported mutant alleles. This screen may have uncovered mutant alleles of these genes. The results of complementation tests with previously identified genes in 44D-45B suggests that over half of the complementation groups identified in this screen may be novel.",2000,"T C Dockendorff, S E Robertson, D L Faulkner, T A Jongens, T C Dockendorff, S E Robertson, D L Faulkner, T A Jongens"

The C-terminal region of RECQE protein is unique and the longest known among members of the RecQ superfamily.

Multiple roles of the Dcdc42 GTPase during wing development in Drosophila melanogaster,11016838,10.1007/s004380000287,"The Rho sub-family of GTPases, comprising Rho, Rac and Cdc42. regulates many biological processes, including morphogenesis, cell polarity, migration, the cell cycle and gene expression. It is important to develop genetic approaches to allow the dissection, in vivo, of the mechanisms of GTPase regulation and signal transmission, and their biological consequences. In this regard, wing development in Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model system. To investigate the functions of the Drosophila Cdc42 GTPase (Dcdc42), we generated phenotypes during wing development, by expression of the dominant-negative N17 and L89 mutants of Dcdc42. We have identified roles for Dcdc42 in wing growth, and in cell fate choice during the development of the wing veins and the peripheral nervous system. Reduction of Dcdc42 signalling following over-expression of Dcdc42N17 resulted in a broader but more diffuse domain characterised by wing-margin sensory bristles. This was correlated with a broadened stripe of wingless expression along the dorsal-ventral boundary of third-instar wing imaginal discs. Together with genetic interactions with loss- and gain-of-function Notch alleles, these data support a role for wild-type Dcdc42 as a negative regulator of Notch signalling.",2000,"M Baron, V O'Leary, D A Evans, M Hicks, K Hudson, M Baron, V O'Leary, D A Evans, M Hicks, K Hudson"
The evolution of an alpha-esterase pseudogene inactivated in the Drosophila melanogaster lineage,10742048,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026336,"Previous analyses of the alpha-esterase cluster of Drosophila melanogaster revealed 10 active genes and the DmalphaE4a-Psi pseudogene. Here, we reconstruct the evolution of the pseudogene from the sequences of 12 alleles from widely scattered D. melanogaster populations and single alleles from Drosophila simulans and Drosophila yakuba. All of the DmalphaE4a-Psi alleles contain numerous inactivating mutations, suggesting that pseudogene alleles are fixed in natural populations. Several lines of evidence also suggest that DmalphaE4a is now evolving without selective constraint in the D. melanogaster lineage. There are three polymorphic indels which result in frameshifts; a key nucleotide of the intron splice acceptor is polymorphic; the neutral mutation parameter is the same for replacement and silent sites; one of the nonsilent polymorphisms results in a stop codon; only 1 of the 13 replacement polymorphisms is biochemically conservative; residues that are conserved among active esterases have different states in DmalphaE4a-Psi; and there are about half as many transitional polymorphisms as transversional ones. In contrast, the D. simulans and D. yakuba orthologs DsalphaE4a and DyalphaE4a do not have the inactivating mutations of DmalphaE4a-Psi and appear to be evolving under the purifying selection typical of protein- encoding genes. For instance, there have been more substitutions in the introns than in the exons, and more in silent sites than in replacement sites. Furthermore, most of the amino acid substitutions that have occurred between DyalphaE4a and DsalphaE4a are located in sites that typically vary among active alpha-esterases rather than those that are usually conserved. We argue that the original alphaE4a gene had a function which it has lost since the divergence of the D. melanogaster and D. simulans lineages.",2000,"G C Robin, R J Russell, D J Cutler, J G Oakeshott"

Virulence variability of the Drosophila C virus and effects of the microparasite on demographic parameters of the host (Drosophila melanogaster),10772327,10.1006/jipa.1999.4913,"We carried out experiments with the Drosophila C virus (DCV), a nonhereditary virus acting on demographic parameters of infected Drosophila host populations. It is well known that DCV increases mortality rate, decreases developmental time, and increases daily fecundity. As usual for Drosophila viruses, the DCV was multiplied in vivo. In this study we tested the hypothesis of virulence variability in DCV strains by isolating different stocks of the virus. The flies were tested for susceptibility to injection of such isolates and for virulence variability. Possible interactions between demographic parameters in three Drosophila host populations and injected isolates were studied under two egg densities (low and high). The hypothesis of virulence variability of DCV was supported by significant differences in mortality rates, depending on whether virus isolates were ingested or injected. When DCV was ingested, differences between host mortality rates were independent of the Drosophila host populations. Nevertheless, the developmental time was equally decreased by each virus isolate, independent of the host population. Moreover, the two viral stocks strongly increased the egg production of the flies. This experimental approach clearly showed that DCV could be considered a polymorphic virus.

Molecular cloning and genomic organization of an allatostatin preprohormone from Drosophila melanogaster,10891383,10.1006/bbrc.2000.3062,"The insect allatostatins are neurohormones, acting on the corpora allata (where they block the release of juvenile hormone) and on the insect gut (where they block smooth muscle contraction). We screened the ""Drosophila Genome Project"" database with electronic sequences corresponding to various insect allatostatins. This resulted in alignment with a DNA sequence coding for some Drosophila allatostatins (drostatins). Using PCR with oligonucleotide primers directed against the presumed exons of this Drosophila allatostatin gene and subsequent 3'- and 5'-RACE, we were able to clone its cDNA. The Drosophila allatostatin preprohormone contains four amino acid sequences that after processing would give rise to four Drosophila allatostatins: Val-Glu-Arg-Tyr-Ala-Phe-Gly-Leu-NH(2) (drostatin-1), Leu-Pro-Val-Tyr-Asn-Phe-Gly-Leu-NH(2) (drostatin-2), Ser-Arg-Pro-Tyr-Ser-Phe-Gly-Leu-NH(2) (drostatin-3), and Thr-Thr-Arg-Pro-Gln-Pro-Phe-Asn-Phe-Gly-Leu-NH(2) (drostatin-4).

Both phenomena are explained at the molecular level by chromatin opening (increased accessibility) of the targeted DNA satellites.

Functional expression of a locust visual pigment in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster,10727930,10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01186.x,"The cDNA encoding a visual pigment of the locust Schistocerca gregaria has been inserted into the germline of the ninaE mutant of Drosophila melanogaster by P-element-mediated transformation. Functional expression has been documented by recording light-regulated electroretinograms in transgenic flies. The spectral properties of the expressed visual pigment were determined with detergent-solubilized material, prepared from the eyecups of the transgenic D. melanogaster. The recombinant locust pigment, as well as the genuine pigment of the fruitfly (Rh1) that served as a control for transformation/expression, showed photoreversibility between the pigment and metapigment forms. The absorptions of the difference spectra identify the locust visual pigment as a short wavelength-absorbing, blue-light-sensitive photoreceptor. The absorption maxima are similar to those recorded on living locust animals. These results show that, although locust visual pigments contain 11-cis retinal as chromophore, the expressed protein is able to adopt 3-hydroxyretinal that is provided by the transgenic fruitflies. The electrophysiological recordings reveal that the locust visual pigment is able to induce phototransduction in the fruitfly. The reported results have two important consequences: On the one hand, the binding site of the locust opsin is apparently able to interact with the 3-hydroxyretinal from Drosophila in a way that the biological signal generated by the photoisomerization of the chromophore can be used by the protein to adopt a physiologically active conformation. On the other hand, despite the relatively large phylogenetic distance between both insect species, the extent of conservation between the protein domains thought to be involved in G-protein activation is striking.",2000,"A Engels, H Reichert, W J Gehring, W GÃ¤rtner, A Engels, H Reichert, W J Gehring, W GÃ¤rtner"

It was shown that TA alone did not modify the spontaneous frequencies of single and twin spots, which means that this polyphenol neither acts as a genotoxin nor exerts any antigenotoxic effect over spontaneous DNA lesions. However, the simultaneous administration of genotoxins with TA can lead to considerable alterations of the frequencies of induced wing spots in comparison to those with administration of the genotoxins alone. In fact, TA produced a significant increase in HN2-induced wing spots with enhancements between 90 and 160%. For MMS, the enhancement was 38% in the highest TA concentration tested. In contrast, a significant protective action of this polyphenol was observed in combined treatments with MMC (64 to 99% inhibition). Moreover, the data from TA posttreatments demonstrated that this agent is not effective in exerting protective or enhancing effects on the genotoxicity of MMS, HN2, or MMC. One feasible mechanism of TA action is its interaction with the enzyme systems catalyzing the metabolic detoxification of MMS and HN2, which may also be involved in the bioactivation of MMC.",2000,"M Lehmann, U Graf, M L Reguly, H H Rodrigues De Andrade, M Lehmann, U Graf, M L Reguly, H H Rodrigues De Andrade"
Adaptation and constraint in the evolution of Drosophila melanogaster wing shape,11258389,10.1046/j.1525-142x.2000.00041.x,"We have taken advantage of parallel instances of natural selection on body size in Drosophila melanogaster to investigate constraints and adaptation affecting wing shape. Using recently developed techniques for statistical shape analysis, we have examined variation in wing shape in similar body size clines on three continents. Gender-related shape differences were constant among all populations, suggesting that gender differences represent a developmental constraint on wing shape. In contrast, the underlying shape varied significantly between continents and shape change within each cline (i.e., between small and large body size populations) also varied between continents. Therefore, variation at these two levels presumably results from either drift or natural selection. Functional considerations suggest that shape variation between the continents is unlikely to be adaptive.

The overall range of wing shape variation, across a large range of wing size, is extremely small, and the possibility that wing shape is subject to stabilizing selection (or canalization) is discussed.",2000,"A S Gilchrist, R B Azevedo, L Partridge, P O'Higgins, A S Gilchrist, R B Azevedo, L Partridge, P O'Higgins"
Cold tolerance in Drosophila: adaptive variations revealed by the analysis of starvation survival reaction norms,10838173,10.1016/s0306-4565(99)00106-0,"Three species of Drosophila were investigated for their capacity to survive without food (starvation tolerance) at seven different temperatures ranging from 0 to 25 degrees C. In all cases biphasic response curves (reaction norms) were observed, corresponding either to special deleterious effects of cold or to a progressive exhaustion of reserves proportional to metabolic rate. The temperature at which survival was longest was called the threshold temperature. The position of the threshold exhibited adaptive changes, either due to acclimation in the same species, or to genetic variations evidenced between species. In D. melanogaster, adults grown at lower temperature (12 degrees C) were more tolerant to cold than adults grown at higher temperatures (21, 25 or 30 degrees C). This acclimation process shifted, in an adaptive way, the position of the threshold temperature from 6.2 to 7.5 degrees C. A comparison of three different species grown at a single developmental temperature (21 degrees C) revealed similar but greater adaptive differences in their threshold temperature: 4.8 degrees C in the temperate D. subobscura, 7 degrees C in the cosmopolitan D. melanogaster and 14.6 degrees C in the tropical D. ananassae.",2000,"D Karan, JR David, D Karan, JR David"
Molecular identification of a taste receptor gene for trehalose in Drosophila,10884225,10.1126/science.289.5476.116,"The molecular nature of sweet taste receptors has not been fully explored. Employing a differential screening strategy, we identified a taste receptor gene, Tre1, that controls the taste sensitivity to trehalose in Drosophila melanogaster. The Tre1 gene encodes a novel protein with similarity to G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptors. Disruption of the Tre1 gene lowered the taste sensitivity to trehalose, whereas sensitivities to other sugars were unaltered. Overexpression of the Tre1 gene restored the taste sensitivity to trehalose in the Tre1 deletion mutant. The Tre1 gene is expressed in taste sensory cells. These results provide direct evidence that Tre1 encodes a putative taste receptor for trehalose in Drosophila.",2000,"H Ishimoto, A Matsumoto, T Tanimura, H Ishimoto, A Matsumoto, T Tanimura"
The sex-determining gene doublesex in the fly Megaselia scalaris: conserved structure and sex-specific splicing,11195332,10.1139/g00-078,"The well-known sex-determining cascade of Drosophila melanogaster serves as a paradigm for the pathway to sexual development in insects. But the primary sex-determining signal and the subsequent step, Sex-lethal (Sxl), have been shown not to be functionally conserved in non-Drosophila flies. We isolated doublesex (dsx), which is a downstream step in the cascade, from the phorid fly Megaselia scalaris, which is a distant relative of D. melanogaster. Conserved properties, e.g., sex-specific splicing, structure of the female-specific 3' splice site, a splicing enhancer region with binding motifs for the TRA2/RBP1/TRA complex that activates female-specific splicing in Drosophila, and conserved domains for DNA-binding and oligomerization in the putative DSX protein, indicate functional conservation of dsx in M. scalaris. Hence, the dsx step of the sex-determining pathway appears to be conserved among flies and probably in an even wider group of insects, as the analysis of a published cDNA from the silkmoth indicates.",2000,"S Kuhn, V Sievert, W Traut, S Kuhn, V Sievert, W Traut"
Extended life-span conferred by cotransporter gene mutations in Drosophila,11118146,10.1126/science.290.5499.2137,"Aging is genetically determined and environmentally modulated. In a study of longevity in the adult fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, we found that five independent P-element insertional mutations in a single gene resulted in a near doubling of the average adult life-span without a decline in fertility or physical activity. Sequence analysis revealed that the product of this gene, named Indy (for I'm not dead yet), is most closely related to a mammalian sodium dicarboxylate cotransporter-a membrane protein that transports Krebs cycle intermediates. Indy was most abundantly expressed in the fat body, midgut, and oenocytes: the principal sites of intermediary metabolism in the fly. Excision of the P element resulted in a reversion to normal life-span. These mutations may create a metabolic state that mimics caloric restriction, which has been shown to extend life-span.",2000,"B Rogina, R A Reenan, S P Nilsen, S L Helfand, B Rogina, R A Reenan, S P Nilsen, S L Helfand"
Nucleotide variation at the yellow gene region is not reduced in Drosophila subobscura: a study in relation to chromosomal polymorphism,11110911,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026296,"In contrast to Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, the yellow (y) gene region of Drosophila subobscura is not located in a region with a strong reduction in recombination. In addition, this gene maps very close to the breakpoints of different inversions that segregate as polymorphic in natural populations of D. subobscura. Therefore, levels of variation at the y gene region in this species relative to those found in D. melanogaster and D. simulans may be affected not only by the change in the recombinational environment, but also by the presence of inversion polymorphism. To further investigate these aspects, an approximately 5.4-kb region of the A (=X) chromosome including the y gene was sequenced in 25 lines of D. subobscura and in the closely related species Drosophila madeirensis and Drosophila guanche. The D. subobscura lines studied differed in their A-chromosomal arrangements, A(st), A(2), and A(1). Unlike in D. melanogaster and D. simulans, levels of variation at the y gene region of D. subobscura are not reduced relative to those found at other genomic regions in the same species (rp49, Acp70A, and Acph-1). This result supports the effect of the change in the recombinational environment of a particular gene on the level of neutral variation. In addition, nucleotide variation is affected by chromosomal polymorphism. A strong genetic differentiation is detected between the A(1) arrangement and either A(st) or A(2), but not between A(st) and A(2). This result is consistent with the location of the y gene relative to the breakpoints of inversions A(1) and A(2). In addition, the pattern of nucleotide polymorphism in A(st)+A(2) and A(1) seems to point out that variation at the y gene region within these chromosomal classes is in the phase transient to equilibrium. The estimated ages of these arrangements assuming a star genealogy indicate that their origin cannot predate the D. madeirensis split. Therefore, the present results are consistent with a chromosomal phylogeny where Am(1), which is an arrangement present in D. madeirensis but absent in current populations of D. subobscura, would be the ancestral arrangement.",2000,"A MuntÃ©, M AguadÃ©, C Segarra, A MuntÃ©, M AguadÃ©, C Segarra"
Determining structure/function relationships for sarcomeric myosin heavy chain by genetic and transgenic manipulation of Drosophila,10998634,10.1002/1097-0029(20000915)50:6<430::AID-JEMT2>3.0.CO;2-E,"Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent system for examining the structure/function relationships of myosin. It yields insights into the roles of myosin in assembly and stability of myofibrils, in defining the mechanical properties of muscle fibers, and in dictating locomotory abilities. Drosophila has a single gene encoding muscle myosin heavy chain (MHC), with alternative RNA splicing resulting in stage- and tissue-specific isoform production. Localization of the alternative domains of Drosophila MHC on a three-dimensional molecular model suggests how they may determine functional differences between isoforms. We are testing these predictions directly by using biophysical and biochemical techniques to characterize myosin isolated from transgenic organisms. Null and missense mutations help define specific amino acid residues important in actin binding and ATP hydrolysis and the function of MHC in thick filament and myofibril assembly. Insights into the interaction of thick and thin filaments result from studying mutations in MHC that suppress ultrastructural defects induced by a troponin I mutation. Analysis of transgenic organisms expressing engineered versions of MHC shows that the native isoform of myosin is not critical for myofibril assembly but is essential for muscle function and maintenance of muscle integrity. We show that the C-terminus of MHC plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of muscle integrity. Transgenic studies using headless myosin reveal that the head is important for some, but not all, aspects of myofibril assembly. The integrative approach described here provides a multi-level understanding of the function of the myosin molecular motor.",2000,"D M Swank, L Wells, W A Kronert, G E Morrill, S I Bernstein, D M Swank, L Wells, W A Kronert, G E Morrill, S I Bernstein"

Racing against host's immunity defenses: a likely strategy for passive evasion of encapsulation in Asobara tabida parasitoids,10818243,10.1016/s0022-1910(99)00227-9,"The hymenopteran Asobara tabida Nees (Braconidae, Alysiinae) develops as a solitary endophagous parasite in larvae of several Drosophila species. Most A. tabida eggs possess a sticky chorion which attaches to the tissue of the host organs within a few hours following oviposition. A. tabida sticky eggs usually avoid encapsulation, though the probability of survival decreases in hosts carrying a larger number of circulating hemocytes. Here, we hypothesized that the elicitation of the encapsulation reaction may result from a race between two phenomena: the host's hemocytic reaction and the embedment of the parasitic egg within the host tissues. In order to test this hypothesis, we measured the speed of capsule formation in D. melanogaster larvae of different ages, knowing that the number of circulating hemocytes increases with the age of the larvae. Using a non-virulent A. tabida strain, the eggs of which do not attach to the host tissue, we found that the speed of capsule formation increased correlatively with the age of the D. melanogaster larva. Therefore, the hypothesis of a physiological race between host's immunity defenses and parasite's avoidance of host's defenses is strongly supported by our results. Also, A. tabida eggs which attach to the host's tissue before the attack by the hemocytes has taken place may be considered as a strategy of passive evasion from encapsulation.",2000,"P Eslin, G PrÃ©vost, P Eslin, G PrÃ©vost"

The rotational dynamics of the bonds along the protein sequence are calculated and compared to the experimentally measured nmr (15)N spin-lattice relaxation time T(1), at 36.5, 60.8, and 81.1 MHz of the vnd/NK-2 homeodomain from Drosophila melanogaster. The starting point for the calculations is the experimental three-dimensional solution structure of the homeodomain determined by multidimensional nmr spectroscopy. The higher order mode-coupling computations are compared also with the recently published first-order approximation calculations. The more accurate calculations improve substantially the first-order ORZLD calculations and show that the role of the strength of the hydrodynamic interactions becomes crucial to fix the order of magnitude of the rotational dynanics for these very compact molecules characterized by partial screening of the internal atoms to water. However, the relative mobility of the bonds along the sequence and the differential fluctuations depend only weakly on the hydrodynamic strength but strongly on the geometry of the three-dimensional structure and on the statistics incorporated into the theory. Both rigid and fluctuating dynamic models are examined, with fluctuations evaluated using molecular dynamics simulations. The comparison with nmr data shows that mode coupling diffusion accounts for the T(1) relaxation pattern at low frequency where the rotational tumbling dominates. An important contribution of internal motions in the nanosecond time scale is seen at high frequencies and is discussed in terms of diffusive concepts.",2000,"G La Penna, S Fausti, A Perico, J A Ferretti, G La Penna, S Fausti, A Perico, J A Ferretti"

Genomic structure and chromosomal localization of human thioredoxin-like protein gene (txl),10826702,10.3109/10425170009015613,"Human thioredoxin-like protein (txl) is a novel member of the expanding thioredoxin superfamily whose main characteristic is the presence, after the thioredoxin domain, of a C-terminal extension of 184 residues with no homology with any other protein in the databases. Txl is a cytosolic ubiquitously expressed protein and it has been copurified with a kinase of the STE20 family, which is proteolytically activated by caspases in apoptosis. However, no cellular function has yet been assigned to this protein. In the present study we report the genomic organization of the txl gene which encompasses approximately 36 kb organized in eight exons ranging from 96 bp to 303 bp. In contrast, intron sizes are much bigger ranging from 1.5 kb to 12 kb. Chromosomal localization of txl gene revealed that it maps at position 18q21, a region frequently affected in different human tumours. Furthermore, we have identified the putative homologues of txl in both Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans that display much closer homology to the known thioredoxins than the human txl protein.

Immunostaining with anti-Bub1 (a kinetochore-specific marker) shows that, in spite of the differences in sequence, both centromeres can be active although as a rule only one at a time. In a small fraction of the chromosomes centromere inactivation is incomplete, giving rise to true dicentric chromosomes.

The biochemical actions of deterin are demonstrated in SF9 and S2 cell transfection assays, in which the expressed protein acts in the cytoplasm to inhibit or deter cells from apoptosis otherwise induced by the caspase-dependent apoptosis activator reaper or by cytotoxicants. A loss of function phenotype for deterin of cell death was indicated by transfections with either a dominant negative deterin mutant or with inhibitory RNA (RNAi) for deterin. The dominant negative C-terminal fragment that antagonized antiapoptotic activity of deterin did not affect antiapoptotic activity of DIAP1 or p35.

The deterin transcript is distributed throughout early stage embryos, whereas in later stage embryos it becomes progressively restricted to the central nervous system and gonads.

As in mammals, rest is abundant in young flies, is reduced in older flies, and is modulated by stimulants and hypnotics. Several molecular markers modulated by sleep and waking in mammals are modulated by rest and activity in Drosophila, including cytochrome oxidase C, the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein BiP, and enzymes implicated in the catabolism of monoamines.

Age-specific mortality and reproduction respond to adult dietary restriction in Drosophila melanogaster,12770153,10.1016/s0022-1910(01)00138-x,"Adult dietary yeast modulates mortality rate and reproduction of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratatis capitata. In the medfly, a sugar-only diet leads to low mortality rates and reduced reproduction; addition of dietary yeast increases both mortality and egg laying. In Drosophila melanogaster low availability of dietary yeast is known to increase life span and reduce the rate of reproduction. Despite these similarities, because of differences in experimental design it remains unclear whether a common physiological mechanism modulates the effect of diet on survival. Here, we investigate how mortality rate and reproduction in D. melanogaster respond to the treatment regime used to study the medfly: no-yeast versus full diet. We find that adult medfly and D. melanogaster have opposite responses to the absence of yeast: D. melanogaster have high mortality when on no-yeast diet; when switched to full diet, D. melanogaster reduce mortality rates to the level presented by females continuously maintained on yeast. This reduction in mortality is accompanied by increased fecundity. These patterns are observed in all tested wildtype stocks, but flies made sterile by mutation in the gene oo18 RNA-binding protein (orb) lack this response.

Like 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), tebufenozide also acts at the receptor level and transactivates the expression of up-regulated genes but, because of its persistence, the down-regulated genes that are normally expressed in the absence of 20E are not expressed. While tebufenozide is lepidopteran-specific, an analog, RH-5849, is effective on dipterans. This is reflected in the respective effects of the two compounds on Cf-203 (C. fumiferana--203), a lepidopteran cell line and Dm-2 (Drosophila melanogaster--2), a dipteran cell line. Cf-203 cells accumulated [14C]tebufenozide and expressed CHR3 (Choristoneura hormone receptor 3), but Dm-2 cells excluded the material and did not express DHR3 (Drosophila hormone receptor 3).

The activation of a neocentromere in Drosophila requires proximity to an endogenous centromere,11514450,,"The centromere is essential for proper segregation and inheritance of genetic information. Centromeres are generally regulated to occur exactly once per chromosome; failure to do so leads to chromosome loss or damage and loss of linked genetic material.

The presence of ectopic centromeres (neocentromeres) has allowed us to probe the requirements and characteristics of centromere activation, maintenance, and structure. We utilized chromosome derivatives that placed a 290-kilobase ""test segment"" in three different contexts within the Drosophila melanogaster genome--immediately adjacent to (1) centromeric chromatin, (2) centric heterochromatin, or (3) euchromatin. Using irradiation mutagenesis, we freed this test segment from the source chromosome and genetically assayed whether the liberated ""test fragment"" exhibited centromere activity. We observed that this test fragment behaved differently with respect to centromere activity when liberated from different chromosomal contexts, despite an apparent sequence identity. Test segments juxtaposed to an active centromere produced fragments with neocentromere activity, whereas test segments far from centromeres did not. Once established, neocentromere activity was stable. The imposition of neocentromere activity on juxtaposed DNA supports the hypothesis that centromere activity and identity is capable of spreading and is regulated epigenetically.",2001,"K A Maggert, G H Karpen, K A Maggert, G H Karpen"
"Locomotor performance of Drosophila melanogaster: interactions among developmental and adult temperatures, age, and geography",11263741,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2001.tb01286.x,"We explored the extent to which a phenotypic trait (walking speed) of Drosophila melanogaster is influenced by population, developmental temperature, adult temperature, and age. Our goals were to estimate the importance of these factors and to test the beneficial acclimation hypothesis. We measured speed of flies from two populations (the Congo and France) that developed at different temperatures (18, 25, and 29 degrees C) and were tested at different temperatures (18, 25, and 29 degrees C) and ages (2, 7, 13 days). Not surprisingly, speed increased strongly with test temperature. Speed was generally greatest for flies reared at an intermediate developmental temperature, contrary to the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, which predicts that speed would be greatest when influenced by interactions involving population. For example, speed was greatest for flies from France that developed at a low temperature, but for flies from the Congo that developed at a high temperature. The impact of developmental temperature declined with age. Surprisingly, speed actually increased with age for flies raised and maintained at a low temperature, but decreased with age for flies raised and maintained at an intermediate or at a high temperature. Thus, walking performance is highly dynamic phenotypically, complicating potential attempts to predict responses to selection on performance.",2001,"P Gibert, R B Huey, G W Gilchrist, P Gibert, R B Huey, G W Gilchrist"
Effects of pineal peptide preparation Epithalamin on free-radical processes in humans and animals,11335874,,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      The review on our own data on the effect of the pineal peptide preparation Epithalamin on free radical processes in rodents and humans is presented in this paper.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The activity of Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) was found decreased in the brain of aged rats (30 months old) by 46.8% as compared to young animals. Concentration of Schiff's bases in the brain also went down with age (by 13.6%), while the level of dien conjugates (DC) and protein peroxidation (PPO) remained unchanged. General antioxidation activity (AOA) in the brain also remained stable with age. The liver of aged rats showed significant increase of Schiff's bases (by 27.1%) and PPO products (by 109.2%) and considerable decrease of SOD activity. The level of DC and general AOA in the liver remained unchanged with age. Considerable elevation of protein and lipid peroxidation products contents was registered in the blood serum of aged rats. At the same time, general AOA and SOD activity remarkably decreased. The results obtained evidence from both significant age-related alterations in the activity of free radical processes in animal organism and organic peculiarities of their dynamics. Application of peptide drug epithalamin suppressed significantly the intensity of peroxide chemoluminescence in the blood serum (2.8-fold) and lipid peroxide oxidation (LPO) expressed in the considerably decreased DC contents (4,1-fold). The contents of Schiff's bases showed only a tendency towards decrease (by 14.4%, p > 0.05) and PPO level remained unchanged. Epithalamin administration was followed by considerable (by 36.6%, p < 0.01) increase of general AOA and increased SOD activity (by 19.7%) in males. Epithalamin decreased significantly the contents of conjugated hydroperoxides and ketodienes in tissues of D.melanogaster females, increased catalase activity in drosophila males and females, and increased SOD activity in males of D.melanogaster by 41%. Humans reveal significant age-related decrease of antioxidation defence indices.

Quantitative genetics of seminal receptacle length in Drosophila melanogaster,11678984,10.1046/j.1365-2540.2001.00903.x,"The length of the female's primary sperm-storage organ, the seminal receptacle, has undergone rapid divergence within the Drosophila genus. Quantitative genetic analysis of seminal receptacle length was carried out on two laboratory strains of Drosophila melanogaster that had undergone artificial selection for both increased and decreased organ length. Realized heritabilities were 0.176 and 0.270 for the two experiments. Parental strains, F1, F1r (reciprocal), F2, backcross, and backcross reciprocal generations were used in a line-cross (generation means) analysis. This analysis revealed that additive, dominance, and additive-by-dominance epistasis contributed significantly to the means. No significant maternal effects were found. Variance analysis indicated that a completely additive model was adequate to explain the variances observed in these lines. Castle-Wright minimal estimates of 5.25 and 1.91, segregating loci responsible for mean differences, were found for the two respective experiments. There were significant positive correlations between additive effects of seminal receptacle length and thorax length in both experiments.

Non-coding snoRNA host genes in Drosophila: expression strategies for modification guide snoRNAs,11302516,10.1078/0171-9335-00150,"Modification guide snoRNAs either are encoded within introns and co-transcribed with the host gene pre-mRNA or are independently transcribed as mono- or polycistronic units. Different eukaryotic kingdoms utilize these coding strategies to various degrees. Intron-encoded and polycistronic snoRNAs are released from primary transcripts as pre-snoRNAs by the spliceosome or by an RNase III-like activity, respectively. In the spliceosomal pathway, the resulting intron lariat is then linearized by a debranching activity. The leader and trailer sequences of pre-snoRNAs are removed by exonucleolytic activities. The majority of snoRNA host genes encode proteins involved in the synthesis, structure or function of the translational apparatus. Several vertebrate snoRNA host genes do not appear to code for functional proteins. We have identified two unusually compact box C/D multi-snoRNA host genes in D. melanogaster, dUHG1 and dUHG2, similar in their organization to the corresponding vertebrate non-protein-coding host genes. In dUHG1 and dUHG2, the snoRNA sequences are located within introns at a conserved distance of about 75 nucleotides upstream of the 3' splice sites. Both genes initiate transcription with TOP-like sequences that share unique features with previously reported Drosophila snoRNA host genes. Although the spliced dUHG RNAs are relatively stable, they exhibit little potential for protein coding.",2001,"K T Tycowski, J A Steitz, K T Tycowski, J A Steitz"
Formation and morphology of dark puffs in Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes,11525061,10.1111/j.1601-5223.2001.00015.x,"The formation of unusual dark puffs in Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes has been studied by electron microscopic (EM) analysis. Fly stocks transformed by the P[ry; Prat:bw] and P[hs-BRC-z1] constructs were used. In the former the bw gene is under the promoter of a housekeeping gene, Prat; in the latter the Br-C locus, mapping to the dark puff 2B, is under the promoter of a heat-shock gene, hsp70. Inserted into region 65A of the 3L chromosome, the Prat:bw copies give rise to structures which are morphologically reminiscent of the so-called ""dark"" puffs. In contrast, insertion of P[hs-BRC-z1] into region 99B of the 3R chromosome causes a regular ""light"" puff of form. Comparative analysis of the dark puffs--both transgenic and natural--suggests that there might be at least two mechanisms underlying their formation. One is a local incomplete decondensation of activated bands, characteristic of the so-called small puffs. The other is the formation of ectopic-looking contacts between the bands adjacent to the puffing zone. Transposition of the DNA, from which such a puff develops, causes a regular light puff to form at the new location.

A reverse genetic analysis of components of the Toll signaling pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans,11516642,10.1016/s0960-9822(01)00241-x,"Background:
      
    

    
      Both animals and plants respond rapidly to pathogens by inducing the expression of defense-related genes. Whether such an inducible system of innate immunity is present in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is currently an open question. Among conserved signaling pathways important for innate immunity, the Toll pathway is the best characterized. In Drosophila, this pathway also has an essential developmental role. C. elegans possesses structural homologs of components of this pathway, and this observation raises the possibility that a Toll pathway might also function in nematodes to trigger defense mechanisms or to control development.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We have generated and characterized deletion mutants for four genes supposed to function in a nematode Toll signaling pathway. These genes are tol-1, trf-1, pik-1, and ikb-1 and are homologous to the Drosophila melanogaster Toll, dTraf, pelle, and cactus genes, respectively. Of these four genes, only tol-1 is required for nematode development. None of them are important for the resistance of C. elegans to a number of pathogens. On the other hand, C. elegans is capable of distinguishing different bacterial species and has a tendency to avoid certain pathogens, including Serratia marcescens. The tol-1 mutants are defective in their avoidance of pathogenic S. marcescens, although other chemosensory behaviors are wild type.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:

High-frequency generation of conditional mutations affecting Drosophila melanogaster development and life span,11454765,,"Genome sequencing reveals that a large percentage of Drosophila genes have homologs in humans, including many human disease genes. The goal of this research was to develop methods to efficiently test Drosophila genes for functions in vivo. An important challenge is the fact that many genes function at more than one point during development and during the life cycle. Conditional expression systems such as promoters regulated by tetracycline (or its derivative doxycycline) are often ideal for testing gene functions. However, generation of transgenic animals for each gene of interest is impractical. Placing the doxycycline-inducible (""tet-on"") promoter directed out of the end of the P transposable element produced a mobile, doxycycline-inducible promoter element, named PdL. PdL was mobilized to 228 locations in the genome and was found to generate conditional (doxycycline-dependent), dominant mutations at high frequency. The temporal control of gene overexpression allowed generation of mutant phenotypes specific to different stages of the life cycle, including metamorphosis and aging. Mutations characterized included inserts in the alpha-mannosidase II (dGMII), ash1, and pumilio genes. Novel phenotypes were identified for each gene, including specific developmental defects and increased or decreased life span. The PdL system should facilitate testing of a large fraction of Drosophila genes for overexpression and misexpression phenotypes at specific developmental and life cycle stages.",2001,"G Landis, D Bhole, L Lu, J Tower, G Landis, D Bhole, L Lu, J Tower"

Genetic variation for preadult viability in Drosophila melanogaster,11580020,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2001.tb00680.x,"The extent of genetic variation in fitness and its components and genetic variation's dependence on environmental conditions remain key issues in evolutionary biology. We present measurements of genetic variation in preadult viability in a laboratory-adapted population of Drosophila melanogaster, made at four different densities. By crossing flies heterozygous for a wild-type chromosome and one of two different balancers (TM1, TM2), we measure both heterozygous (TM1/+, TM2/+) and homozygous (+/+) viability relative to a standard genotype (TM1/TM2). Forty wild-type chromosomes were tested, of which 10 were chosen to be homozygous viable. The mean numbers produced varied significantly between chromosome lines, with an estimated between-line variance in log(e) numbers of 0.013. Relative viabilities also varied significantly across chromosome lines, with a variance in log(e) homozygous viability of 1.76 and of log(e) heterozygous viability of 0.165. The between-line variance for numbers emerging increased with density, from 0.009 at lowest density to 0.079 at highest. The genetic variance in relative viability increases with density, but not significantly. Overall, the effects of different chromosomes on relative viability were remarkably consistent across densities and across the two heterozygous genotypes (TM1, TM2). The 10 lines that carried homozygous viable wild-type chromosomes produced significantly more adults than the 30 lethal lines at low density and significantly fewer adults at the highest density. Similarly, there was a positive correlation between heterozygous viability and mean numbers at low density, but a negative correlation at high density.",2001,"M Gardner, K Fowler, L Partridge, N Barton, M Gardner, K Fowler, L Partridge, N Barton"
The peroxiredoxin gene family in Drosophila melanogaster,11677042,10.1016/s0891-5849(01)00692-x,"Five peroxiredoxin genes have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster on the basis of a genome-wide search. Three of the genes (DPx-4156, DPx-4783, and DPx-5037) fall into the 2-Cys subgroup, while the other two (DPx-2540 and DPx-6005) belong to the 1-Cys subgroup. Using cDNAs, all five were expressed in E. coli and the purified recombinant proteins were shown to reduce H(2)O(2) in the presence of dithiothreitol. The three 2-Cys Prx were also shown to be active in the thioredoxin system and were, consequently, classified as thioredoxin peroxidases. Antisera raised against the DPx-4783 recombinant protein crossreacted with all family members and recognized protein species of the predicted sizes (22-27 kD). All five family members, when individually overexpressed in Drosophila S2 cells, conferred some resistance to H(2)O(2) treatment, as measured by cell viability. Functional diversification of the Drosophila peroxiredoxin family members was suggested by two lines of evidence: (i) the patterns of mRNA accumulation varied for the different genes during development and (ii) recombinant proteins fused to an epitope tag and overexpressed in Drosophila cells, differed in subcellular localizations--three proteins occurred in the cytosol, one was localized to the mitochondria, and one was found to be secreted.",2001,"S N Radyuk, V I Klichko, B Spinola, R S Sohal, W C Orr, S N Radyuk, V I Klichko, B Spinola, R S Sohal, W C Orr"

One of the worse represented of them is that of mdg1, integrated so far only by the Drosophila retrotransposons mdg1 and 412. Our exhaustive database searches indicate the existence of three other Drosophila members of this lineage. Two of them correspond to elements already known, namely, Stalker and blood, but the third one is a new element, which we have called Pilgrim. This element is well represented within the D. melanogaster genome, as revealed by our Southern blot analysis of different strains.

Costs of counterdefenses to host resistance in a parasitoid of Drosophila,11681736,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2001.tb00830.x,"The ability of a parasitoid to evolve enhanced counterdefenses against host resistance and its possible costs were studied in a Drosophila-parasitoid system. We reared Asobara tabida (Braconidae, Hymenoptera) exclusively on D. melanogaster to impose artificial selection for improved counterdefenses against cellular encapsulation, the main host defense against parasitism. Controls were reared on D. subobscura, the main host of the population of wasps from which the laboratory culture was derived and a species that never encapsulates parasitoids. We observed improved survival and avoidance of encapsulation in all five selection lines compared to their paired control lines, although there was unexpected variation among pairs. Improved survival was associated with parasitoid eggs becoming embedded in host tissue, where they were protected from circulating haemocytes. There were no differences among lines in average adult size, fat content, egg load, or performance on D. subobscura. However, the duration of the egg stage in selection lines was longer than that of control lines, probably because of reduced nutrient and/or oxygen supply when eggs are embedded in host tissue. We suggest that this delay in hatching reduces the probability of parasitoid survival if another parasitoid egg is laid in the same host (superparasitism or multiparasitism) and hence is a cost of enhanced counterdefenses against host resistance.",2001,"A R Kraaijeveld, K A Hutcheson, E C Limentani, H C Godfray, A R Kraaijeveld, K A Hutcheson, E C Limentani, H C Godfray"
Combining Drosophila melanogaster somatic-mutation-recombination and electron-spin-resonance-spectroscopy data to interpret epidemiologic observations on chromium carcinogenicity,11678612,10.1023/a:1017959222379,"Lung cancers are significantly increased among workers exposed to chromate (Cr6+, Cr3+), chromium pigments (Cr6+) and chromium plating (Cr6+). Chromium lung burdens and cancer risk increase proportionately with duration of employment at long latencies.

We have attempted to combine epidemiologic data with data from the Drosophila melanogaster somatic-mutation-recombination-test and from the in vitro electron-spin-resonance spectroscopy study to demonstrate that following somatic recombination plays a more important role than somatic mutation in chromium carcinogenesis. Cr4+ is more important than Cr5+ or Cr6+ in inducing somatic recombination while Cr6+ produces more and bigger clones than Cr4+ in somatic mutation. Cr3+ produces negative results in this fruit-fly wing-spot-assay. When the larvae and flies exposed to Cr6+ and Cr4+ are examined by ESR, only Cr5+ and Cr3+ are found.

Interaction of Drosophila acetylcholinesterases with D-tubocurarine: an explanation of the activation by an inhibitor,11170446,10.1021/bi001024l,"Homotropic cooperativity in Drosophila melanogaster acetylcholinesterase seems to be a consequence of an initial substrate binding to a high-affinity peripheral substrate binding site situated around the negative charge of D413 (G335, Torpedo numbering). An appropriate mutation which turns the peripheral binding site to a low-affinity spot abolishes apparent activation but improves the overall enzyme effectiveness. This contradiction can be explained as less effective inhibition due to a shorter occupation of such a peripheral site. A similar effect can be achieved by an appropriate peripheral inhibitor such as TC, which can in special cases, when less effective heterotropic inhibition prevails over homotropic, acts as an activator. At the highest substrate concentrations, however, these enzymes are always inhibited, although steric components may influence the strength of inhibition like in the F368G mutant (F290, Torpedo numbering). Cooperative effects thus may include a steric component, but covering of the entrance must affect influx and efflux to different extents.",2001,"M Golicnik, D Fournier, J Stojan, M Golicnik, D Fournier, J Stojan"

Edman sequencing and mass spectrometry of the purified ligands revealed two decapentapeptides, which differ only by an N-terminal pyroglutamate/glutamine. The peptides align to a hormone precursor sequence of the Drosophila genome data base and are almost identical to allatostatin C from Manduca sexta. Both receptors were activated by the synthetic peptides irrespective of the N-terminal modification.

I highlight recent advances made in the field and discuss the physiological outcomes and consequences of this process. Indeed, phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is important in shaping or remodeling tissues to maintain their integrity and specialized functions during development and wound healing. It also contributes to the development of inflammation and/or its resolution after an injury or infection. This perhaps explains why the molecular mechanisms of phagocytosis of apoptotic cells are redundant and complex in mammals and suggests why they appear to have been mostly conserved through evolution. Caenorhabditis elegans has already proven to be useful in genetically dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying phagocytosis of apoptotic corpses by 'amateur' neighboring cells.

In this assay, 3-day-old transheterozygous larvae for the multiple wing hairs (mwh, 3-0.3) and flare (flr, 3-38.8) genes were treated with three reference mutagenic compounds, namely cobalt chloride (CoCl2), 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO) and potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7). The results obtained show that the three reference mutagens tested were clearly genotoxic in the Drosophila wing somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART). None of the three concentrations tested of ascorbic acid (25, 75 and 250mM) induced significant increases in the frequency of the mutant clones recorded. When co-treatment experiments with ascorbic acid were carried out, different results were found. Thus, ascorbic acid was effective in reducing the genotoxicity of K2Cr2O7 virtually to the control level; on the contrary, it did not show any antigenotoxic effect on the genotoxicity of 4-NQO. Finally, co-treatments with CoCl2 and ascorbic acid show a significant increase in the frequency of mutant clones over the values obtained with CoCl2 alone.",2002,"BÃ¼lent Kaya, Amadeu Creus, Antonia VelÃ¡zquez, Atila Yaniko?lu, Ricardo Marcos, BÃ¼lent Kaya, Amadeu Creus, Antonia VelÃ¡zquez, Atila Yaniko?lu, Ricardo Marcos"
Structure of variation in enzyme activity in natural Drosophila melanogaster populations,12184493,10.1034/j.1601-5223.2002.1360111.x,"Enzyme activity variation was assessed in several isofemale lines originating from two Hungarian Drosophila melanogaster populations. Samples from each population were taken from from two villages; 8-9 isofemale lines were established from each village. The activities of ADH, alphaGPDH, IDH and 6PGDH were determined in the adults (in the F1 generation) and in the larvae (in the F3 generation) as well. Enzyme activities were measured on starch gel after electrophoresis. The activity of the enzyme was detected in a single individual and it was also possible to determine its genotype. The results showed that most of the variation occurred within sites for all four enzymes. This within site variation was more or less equally partitioned into within and between isofemale line (family) components. A smaller portion of variation was attributable to the differences between the populations. Nevertheless, adult alphaGPDH, and larval IDH and 6PGDH activities exhibited significant differences between the two populations. Variation in larval activities of all enzymes was higher than that of the adults, but 6PGDH had considerably higher variation in the adults. The greater variation in larval activities probably reflected the greater environmental variation in the microhabitat of the larvae compared to that of the adults. Larval activities of the investigated enzymes showed much stronger correlation than adult activities. The correlation pattern in the adults differed greatly between the two populations.",2002,"Katalin Pecsenye, Anssi Saura, Katalin Pecsenye, Anssi Saura"
Tandem UAA repeats at the 3'-end of the transcript are essential for the precise initiation of reverse transcription of the I factor in Drosophila melanogaster,11882661,10.1074/jbc.M200996200,"Non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons, widespread among eukaryotic genomes, transpose by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. Some of them, like L1 in the human, terminate at the 3'-end with a poly(dA) stretch whereas others, like the I factor in Drosophila melanogaster, have instead a short sequence repeated in tandem. This suggests different requirements for the initiation of reverse transcription. Here, we have used an RNA circularization/reverse transcription-PCR technique to analyze the 5'- and 3'-ends of the full-length transcripts produced by the I factor at the time of active retrotransposition. These transcripts are capped and polyadenylated similar to conventional messenger RNAs. We have analyzed the 3'-ends of transcripts and transposed copies produced by I elements mutated at the 3'-ends. Transcripts devoid of tandem UAA repeats, although capable of building the components of the retrotransposition machinery, are inefficiently used as retrotransposition intermediates. Such transcripts produce rare new integrated copies issued from the inaccurate initiation of reverse transcription near the 3'-end of the element. The tandem UAA repeats at the 3'-end of the transcripts of I are required for the efficient and precise initiation of reverse transcription. This strong specificity of the I factor reverse transcriptase for its own transcript has implications for the impact of I factor retrotransposition on the host genome.",2002,"SÃ©verine Chambeyron, Alain Bucheton, Isabelle Busseau, SÃ©verine Chambeyron, Alain Bucheton, Isabelle Busseau"

It has been suggested that the intracellular signal transduction of PBAN in B. mori involves Ca(2+), calmodulin, and calcineurin (also known as protein phosphatase 2B). We have cloned two cDNAs encoding calcineurin heterosubunits from a pheromone gland cDNA library of B. mori. The 2,996-bp clone predicts a 495-amino acid protein homologous to the catalytic subunit calcineurin A (CnA) with a molecular mass of 55,968. The deduced amino acid sequence well conserves the calcineurin B (CnB)-binding domain and two subdomains, a calmodulin-binding and an autoinhibitory domain, showing 77-85% and 82% identities to the isoforms of Drosophila melanogaster CnA and human CnA, respectively. On the other hand, the 820-bp clone predicts a 170-amino acid protein homologous to the regulatory subunit CnB with a molecular mass of 19,357. The deduced amino acid sequence well conserves four EF-hand type calcium-binding structures, showing 95% and about 85% identities to D. melanogaster CnB and mammalian CnBs, respectively. A yeast two-hybrid system has demonstrated the molecular interaction between B. mori CnA and CnB. Northern blot analyses revealed that both CnA and CnB genes were expressed in various larval and adult tissues of B. mori. Both transcripts detected in the pheromone gland three days before adult eclosion increased by the day before eclosion and the mRNA levels were found to be high even two days after adult eclosion. Immunohistochemical analysis has revealed that B. mori calcineurin is localized in the cytoplasm of the pheromone-producing cells.",2002,"T Yoshiga, N Yokoyama, N Imai, A Ohnishi, K Moto, S Matsumoto, T Yoshiga, N Yokoyama, N Imai, A Ohnishi, K Moto, S Matsumoto"

Functional dissection of neuroanatomical loci regulating ethanol sensitivity in Drosophila,12417673,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.22-21-09490.2002,"Ethanol has complex but similar effects on behavior in mammals and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, genetic and pharmacological approaches have implicated the cAMP pathway in the regulation of ethanol-induced behaviors in both flies and rodents. Here we examine the neuroanatomical loci that modulate ethanol sensitivity in Drosophila by targeting the expression of an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to specific regions in the fly's brain. Expression of the inhibitor in most brain regions or in muscle has no effect on behavior. In contrast, inhibition of PKA in a relatively small number of cells, possibly neurosecretory cells, in the fly's brain is sufficient to decrease sensitivity to the incoordinating effects of ethanol. Additional brain areas are, however, also involved. The mushroom bodies, brain structures where cAMP signaling is required for olfactory classical conditioning, are dispensable for the regulation of ethanol sensitivity. Finally, different behavioral effects of ethanol, motor incoordination and sedation, appear to be regulated by PKA function in distinct brain regions. We conclude that the regulation of ethanol-induced behaviors by PKA involves complex interactions among groups of cells that mediate either increased or reduced sensitivity to the acute intoxicating effects of ethanol.",2002,"Aylin R Rodan, John A Kiger Jr, Ulrike Heberlein, Aylin R Rodan, John A Kiger Jr, Ulrike Heberlein"
The actin loci in the genus Drosophila: establishment of chromosomal homologies among five nearctic species of the Drosophila obscura group by in situ hybridization,12424525,10.1007/s00412-002-0207-3,"The actin genes of five nearctic species of the Drosophila obscura group were mapped by in situ hybridization, using the 5C actin gene of D. melanogaster as a probe. In all species but D. azteca eight actin loci were observed variously dispersed over all five (A- E) chromosomal elements. In D. azteca ten actin hybridization sites were found; four of which most probably originated by duplications or by transposition events. Although the five nearctic species differ from all other Drosophila species of the D. obscura group so far studied in the number of loci as well as in the chromosomal distribution and location of the actin loci, the uniformity of the main pattern with six actin loci throughout the genus Drosophila reinforces the hypothesis that the chromosomal elements have maintained their essential identities during the course of evolution. Our findings are in accordance with the conclusion that the nearctic D. obscura species have differentiated from a common ancestor of the palearctic species and that they belong to two distinct subgroups, the pseudoobscura and the affinis subgroups.",2002,"George P Bondinas, Michael G Loukas, George N Goulielmos, Diether Sperlich, George P Bondinas, Michael G Loukas, George N Goulielmos, Diether Sperlich"
"Structural and enzymatic characterization of Drosophila Dm2-MMP, a membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase with tissue-specific expression",11967260,10.1074/jbc.M200121200,"We report the isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding Dm2-MMP, the second matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) identified in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The cloned cDNA codes for a polypeptide of 758 residues that displays a domain organization similar to that of other MMPs, including signal peptide, propeptide, catalytic, and hemopexin domains. However, the structure of Dm2-MMP is unique because of the presence of an insertion of 214 amino acids between the catalytic and hemopexin domains that is not present in any of the previously described MMPs. Dm2-MMP also contains a C-terminal extension predicted to form a cleavable glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor site. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis of S2 cells transfected with the isolated cDNA confirmed that Dm2-MMP is localized at the cell surface. Production of the catalytic domain of Dm2-MMP in Escherichia coli and analysis of its enzymatic activity revealed that this proteinase cleaves several synthetic peptides used for analysis of vertebrate MMPs. This proteolytic activity was abolished by MMP inhibitors such as BB-94, confirming that the isolated cDNA codes for an enzymatically active metalloproteinase. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that Dm2-MMP is expressed at low levels in all of the developmental stages of Drosophila as well as in adult flies. However, detailed in situ hybridization at the larval stage revealed a strong tissue-specific expression in discrete regions of the brain and eye imaginal discs.

We have initiated a characterization of the mechanisms that regulate Dm myb expression, and we report here that the transcriptional activator DREF (the DNA replication-related element binding factor) activates Dm myb transcription via two binding sites located in the 5' flanking region; that the Dm myb promoter lacks a prototypical TATA box sequence and instead appears to use an initiator/downstream promoter element (Inr/DPE) type promoter; and that Dm myb expression is regulated at the translational as well as transcriptional level.",2002,"Nikolai V Sharkov, Gary Ramsay, Alisa L Katzen, Nikolai V Sharkov, Gary Ramsay, Alisa L Katzen"
[Characteristic features of induced mutagenesis in hybrid dysgenesis systems of Drosophila melanogaster],12449645,,"The mutagenic effect of low-dose gamma-irradiation was studied in Drosophila melanogaster systems of hybrid dysgenesis by estimating polytene chromosome rearrangements, recombination frequency, and viability at the embryonic and postembryonic developmental stages. A dose of gamma-irradiation which had no effect detectable by routine line crossing proved to significantly reduce the number of recombinants in the H-E and P-M systems and mortality at postembryonic stages. However, this combined effect was obtained if irradiation followed transposition, i.e., it depended on the application sequence of the mutagenic factors. The reverse order of the mutagenic treatment led to summation of the effects: as compared to either control, the frequencies of the dominant allele mutations as well as the larval and pupal mortality in F2 increased significantly (at the level of 99.9%). This allowed us to estimate the contribution of extremely low-dose gamma-irradiation into the mutagenic effect, which was impossible under routine conditions.",2002,"N I Ivashchenko, T M Grishaeva, N I Ivashchenko, T M Grishaeva"

Expression of the Idefix retrotransposon in early follicle cells in the germarium of Drosophila melanogaster is determined by its LTR sequences and a specific genomic context,11976956,10.1007/s00438-002-0641-1,"Retrotransposons are transcriptionally activated in different tissues and cell types by a variety of genomic and environmental factors. Transcription of LTR retrotransposons is controlled by cis-acting regulatory sequences in the 5' LTR. Mobilization of two LTR retroelements, Idefix and ZAM, occurs in the unstable RevI line of Drosophila melanogaster, in which their copy numbers are high, while they are low in all other stocks tested. Here we show that both a full-length and a subgenomic Idefix transcript that are necessary for its mobilization are present in the Rev1 line, but not in the other lines. Studies on transgenic strains demonstrate that the 5' LTR of Idefix contains sequences that direct the tissue-specific expression of the retroelement in testes and ovaries of adult flies. In ovaries, expression occurs in the early follicle and in other somatic cells of the germarium, and is strictly associated with the unstable genetic context conferred by the RevI line. Control of tissue-specific Idefix expression by interactions between cis-acting sequences of its LTR and trans-acting genomic factors provides an opportunity to use this retroelement as a tool for the study of the early follicle cell lineage in the germarium.",2002,"S Tcheressiz, V Calco, F Arnaud, L Arthaud, B Dastugue, C Vaury, S Tcheressiz, V Calco, F Arnaud, L Arthaud, B Dastugue, C Vaury"

In Drosophila melanogaster, mutations that result in hyperactivity of the Jak kinase Hopscotch (Hop) cause an activation of the larval blood cell encapsulation response, including blood cell aggregation and differentiation of plasmatocytes into apparent lamellocytes. Here, we demonstrate that Hop requires the activity of the Raf pathway to promote the activation response of larval plasmatocytes, and provide evidence to suggest that the Hop and D-Raf proteins physically interact.

How one becomes many: blastoderm cellularization in Drosophila melanogaster,12386932,10.1002/bies.10184,"Embryonic development in Drosophila melanogaster begins with a rapid series of mitotic nuclear divisions, unaccompanied by cytokinesis, to produce a multi-nucleated single cell embryo, the syncytial blastoderm. The syncytium then undergoes a process of cell formation, in which the individual nuclei become enclosed in individual cells. This process of cellularization involves integrating mechanisms of cell polarity, cell-cell adhesion and a specialized form of cytokinesis. The detailed molecular mechanism, however, is highly complex and, despite extensive analysis, remains poorly understood. Nevertheless, new insights are emerging from recent studies on aspects of membrane polarization and insertion, which show that membrane components from intracellular organelles are involved. In addition, actin and actin-associated proteins have been heavily implicated while new evidence shows that microtubule cytoskeletal elements are mechanistically involved in all aspects of cellularization.

Mutations in spalt cause a severe but reversible neurodegenerative phenotype in the embryonic central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster,12421699,10.1242/dev.00158,"The gene spalt is expressed in the embryonic central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster but its function in this tissue is still unknown.

Electron microscopy showed that in the absence of spalt, the central nervous system cells are separated by enlarged extracellular spaces populated by membranous material at 60% of embryonic development. Surprisingly, the central nervous system from slightly older embryos (80% of development) exhibited almost wild-type morphology. An extensive survey by laser confocal microscopy revealed that the spalt mutant central nervous system has abnormal levels of particular cell adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins. Time-lapse analysis of neuronal differentiation in vitro, lineage analysis and transplantation experiments confirmed that the mutation causes cytoskeletal and adhesion defects. The data indicate that in the central nervous system, spalt operates within a regulatory pathway which influences the expression of the beta-catenin Armadillo, its ligand N-Cadherin, Notch, and the cell adhesion molecules Neuroglian, Fasciclin 2 and Fasciclin 3.

Patterns of genetic variation at a chromosome 4 locus of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans,11861556,,"DNA sequence surveys of Drosophila melanogaster populations show a strong positive correlation between the recombination rate experienced by a locus and its level of nucleotide polymorphism. In particular, surveys of the fourth chromosome gene ci(D) show greatly reduced levels of nucleotide variation; this observation was originally interpreted in terms of selective sweeps occurring on the nonrecombining fourth chromosome. Subsequent theoretical work has, however, uncovered several other selective processes that can reduce variation. In this study, we revisit the Drosophila fourth chromosome, investigating variation in 5-6 kb of the gene ankyrin in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Silent nucleotide site diversity is approximately 5 x 10(-4) for both species, consistent with the previous observations of low variation at ci(D). Given the observed frequency spectra at ankyrin, coalescent simulations indicate that reduced diversity in the region is unlikely to be due to a selective sweep alone.

The stwl mutations resulted in a loss of germline stem cells, causing a rapid decrease in egg chamber production. The egg chambers developed only to a limited extent before degenerating. The four mitotic cystocyte divisions were frequently inhibited by stwl mutations. Furthermore, some stwl germaria from newly emerged females completely lacked both stem cells and developing cysts and had a strong reduction in size.

The interaction of [Leu(7)]-DSK-1S with DSK-R1 led to a dose-dependent intracellular calcium increase with an EC(50) in the low nanomolar range. The observed Ca(2+) signal predominantly resulted from activation of pertussis toxin (PTX)-insensitive signaling pathways pointing most likely to G(q/11) involvement in coupling to the activated receptor. The unsulfated [Leu(7)]-DSK-1 was ca. 3000-fold less potent than its sulfated counterpart which stresses the importance of the sulfate moiety for the biological activity of drosulfakinin. The DSK-R1 was specific for the insect sulfakinin since two related vertebrate sulfated peptides, human CCK-8 and gastrin-II, were found inactive when tested at concentrations up to 10(-5) M.

Effect of low stressful temperature on genetic variation of five quantitative traits in Drosophila melanogaster,12080372,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800104,"A half-sib analysis was used to investigate genetic variation for three morphological traits (thorax length, wing length and sternopleural bristle number) and two life-history traits (developmental time and larva-to-adult viability) in Drosophila melanogaster reared at a standard (25 degrees C) and a low stressful (13 degrees C) temperature. Both phenotypic and environmental variation showed a significant increase under stressful conditions in all traits. For estimates of genetic variation, no statistically significant differences were found between the two environments. Narrow heritabilities tended to be higher at 13 degrees C for sternopleural bristle number and viability and at 25 degrees C for wing length and developmental time, whereas thorax length did not show any trend. However, the pattern of genetic variances and evolvability indices (coefficient of genetic variation and evolvability), considered in the context of literature evidence, indicated the possibility of an increase in additive genetic variation for the morphological traits and viability and in nonadditive genetic variation for developmental time.

"An endogenous Drosophila receptor for glycans bearing alpha 1,3-linked core fucose residues",11960993,10.1074/jbc.M202825200,"The genome of Drosophila melanogaster encodes several proteins that are predicted to contain Ca(2+)-dependent, C-type carbohydrate-recognition domains. The CG2958 gene encodes a protein containing 359 amino acid residues. Analysis of the CG2958 sequence suggests that it consists of an N-terminal domain found in other Drosophila proteins, a middle segment that is unique, and a C-terminal C-type carbohydrate-recognition domain. Expression studies show that the full-length protein is a tetramer formed by noncovalent association of disulfide-linked dimers that are linked through cysteine residues in the N-terminal domain. The expressed protein binds to immobilized yeast invertase through the C-terminal carbohydrate-recognition domain. Competition binding studies using monosaccharides demonstrate that CG2958 interacts specifically with fucose and mannose. Fucose binds approximately 5-fold better than mannose. Blotting studies reveal that the best glycoprotein ligands are those that contain N-linked glycans bearing alpha1,3-linked fucose residues.

Chaperone suppression of alpha-synuclein toxicity in a Drosophila model for Parkinson's disease,11823645,10.1126/science.1067389,"Parkinson's disease is a movement disorder characterized by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Dopaminergic neuronal loss also occurs in Drosophila melanogaster upon directed expression of alpha-synuclein, a protein implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and a major component of proteinaceous Lewy bodies. We report that directed expression of the molecular chaperone Hsp70 prevented dopaminergic neuronal loss associated with alpha-synuclein in Drosophila and that interference with endogenous chaperone activity accelerated alpha-synuclein toxicity.

The mechanism of gamma-secretase activities through high molecular weight complex formation of presenilins is conserved in Drosophila melanogaster and mammals,12388554,10.1074/jbc.M205352200,"Mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1) and PS2 genes contribute to the pathogenesis of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease by increasing secretion of the pathologically relevant Abeta42 polypeptides. PS genes are also implicated in Notch signaling through proteolytic processing of the Notch receptor in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and mammals. Here we show that Drosophila PS (Psn) protein undergoes endoproteolytic cleavage and forms a stable high molecular weight (HMW) complex in Drosophila S2 or mouse neuro2a (N2a) cells in a similar manner to mammalian PS. The loss-of-function recessive point mutations located in the C-terminal region of Psn, that cause an early pupal-lethal phenotype resembling Notch mutant in vivo, disrupted the HMW complex formation, and abolished gamma-secretase activities in cultured cells. The overexpression of Psn in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking PS1 and PS2 genes rescued the Notch processing. Moreover, disruption of the expression of Psn by double-stranded RNA-mediated interference completely abolished the gamma-secretase activity in S2 cells. Surprisingly, gamma-secretase activity dependent on wild-type Psn was associated with a drastic overproduction of Abeta1-42 from human betaAPP in N2a cells, but not in S2 cells. Our data suggest that the mechanism of gamma-secretase activities through formation of HMW PS complex, as well as its abolition by loss-of-function mutations located in the C terminus, are highly conserved features in Drosophila and mammals.",2002,"Nobumasa Takasugi, Yasuko Takahashi, Yuichi Morohashi, Taisuke Tomita, Takeshi Iwatsubo, Nobumasa Takasugi, Yasuko Takahashi, Yuichi Morohashi, Taisuke Tomita, Takeshi Iwatsubo"
O-ethylthymidine adducts are the most relevant damages for mutation induced by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea in female germ cells of Drosophila melanogaster,12203408,10.1002/em.10101,"Responses to genotoxic agents vary not only among organisms, test systems, and cellular stages, but also between sexes; little, however, is known about the mutagenic consequences of chemical exposures to female germ cells. In this study, the mutagenicity of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) was analyzed in female germ cells of Drosophila melanogaster using the recessive-lethal test and the vermilion system, which simultaneously generates information on induced mutation frequency and mutation spectrum. ENU was mutagenic in all stages of oogenesis, although there were differences among the stages. In mature and immature oocytes, ENU-induced mutations in the vermilion locus were 43.5% A:T-->G:C transitions, 39.1% A:T-->T:A transversions, 8.7% G:C-->A:T transitions, and 8.7% A:T-->C:G transversions, indicating that the most important premutagenic lesions induced by this chemical are O(4)-ethylthymine and O(2)-ethylthymine. The low frequency of mutation involving O(6)-ethylguanine (i.e., G:C-->A:T transitions) could be a consequence of the repair of these lesions by O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase. Comparison of these results with those previously obtained in male germ cells stresses the importance of the repair activity of the analyzed cells, because the mutation spectrum in female germ cells was similar to the spectrum obtained with repair-proficient spermatogonial cells and different from repair-deficient postmeiotic cells. The results also indicate that studies with female germ cells could be an alternative to the use of premeiotic male germ cells, especially when the analysis of these cells is difficult or almost impossible and when studies of in vivo DNA repair in premeiotic germ cells are performed.",2002,"L Alvarez, M A Comendador, L M Sierra, L Alvarez, M A Comendador, L M Sierra"
Transposon telomeres are widely distributed in the Drosophila genus: TART elements in the virilis group,12626755,10.1073/pnas.0230353100,"Telomeres of most animals, plants, and unicellular eukaryotes are made up of tandem arrays of repeated DNA sequences produced by the enzyme telomerase. Drosophila melanogaster has an unusual variation on this theme; telomeres consist of tandem arrays of sequences produced by successive transpositions of two non-LTR retrotransposons, HeT-A and TART. To explore the phylogenetic distribution of these variant telomeres, we have looked for TART homologues in a distantly related Drosophila species, virilis. We have found elements that, despite many differences in nucleotide sequence, retain significant amino acid similarity to TART from D. melanogaster. These D. virilis TART elements have features that characterize TART elements in D. melanogaster: (i) they are found in tandem arrays on chromosome ends, (ii) they are not found in euchromatin, and (iii) they produce both sense and antisense transcripts, with the antisense RNA being in excess. The D. virilis TART elements have one surprising feature: both of the ORFs contain long stretches of the trinucleotide repeat CAX, encoding polyglutamine (with a few interspersed histidines). These long polyglutamine stretches are conserved in the three D. virilis elements sequenced. They do not interrupt any domains of known function in the TART proteins and are not seen in TART proteins from other species. Comparison of the D. virilis and D. melanogaster telomeres suggests that the retrotransposon mechanism of telomere maintenance may have arisen before the separation of the genus Drosophila.",2003,"Elena Casacuberta, Mary-Lou Pardue"
Signal-induced transcriptional activation by Dif requires the dTRAP80 mediator module,12556495,10.1128/mcb.23.4.1358-1367.2003,"The Mediator complex is the major multiprotein transcriptional coactivator complex in Drosophila melanogaster. Mediator components interact with diverse sets of transcriptional activator proteins to elicit the sophisticated regulation of gene expression. The distinct phenotypes associated with certain mutations in some of the Mediator genes and the specific in vitro interactions of Mediator gene products with transcriptional activator proteins suggest the presence of activator-specific binding subunits within the Mediator complex. However, the physiological relevance of these selective in vitro interactions has not been addressed. Therefore, we analyzed dTRAP80, one of the putative activator-binding subunits of the Mediator, for specificity of binding to a number of natural transcriptional activators from Drosophila. Among the group of activator proteins that requires the Mediator complex for transcriptional activation, only a subset of these proteins interacted with dTRAP80 in vitro and only these dTRAP80-interacting activators were defective for activation under dTRAP80-deficient in vivo conditions. In particular, activation of Drosophila antimicrobial peptide drosomycin gene expression by the NF-kappa B-like transcription factor Dif during induction of the Toll signaling pathway was dependent on the dTRAP80 module. These results, and the indirect support from the dTRAP80 artificial recruitment assay, indicate that dTRAP80 serves as a genuine activator-binding target responsible for a distinct group of activators.",2003,"Jin Mo Park, Jung Mo Kim, Lark Kyun Kim, Se Nyun Kim, Jeongsil Kim-Ha, Jung Hoe Kim, Young-Joon Kim, Jin Mo Park, Jung Mo Kim, Lark Kyun Kim, Se Nyun Kim, Jeongsil Kim-Ha, Jung Hoe Kim, Young-Joon Kim"
Thioredoxin peroxidases can foster cytoprotection or cell death in response to different stressors: over- and under-expression of thioredoxin peroxidase in Drosophila cells,12556226,10.1042/BJ20021522,"Recently, we identified a set of five genes constituting the peroxiredoxin gene family in Drosophila melanogaster [Radyuk, Klichko, Spinola, Sohal and Orr (2001) Free Radical Biol.

Overexpression of either one of them in Drosophila S2 cells conferred increased resistance to toxicity induced by hydrogen peroxide, paraquat or cadmium. To understand further the functional roles of these enzymes in vivo, we report in the present study the effects of decreased expression, using RNA interference, on the response of S2 cells to different stressors. When either of the TPxs was blocked, cells became relatively more susceptible to oxidative stress caused by exposure to hydrogen peroxide or paraquat, but were unaffected when challenged with copper and heat stress. In contrast, TPx overexpressing cells were more susceptible to copper and heat stress when compared with control cells and exhibited DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, when cells were supplemented with N -acetyl-L-cysteine together with copper, there was a clear negative effect on cell survival, which was exacerbated by TPx overexpression. Manipulations in the levels of TPxs demonstrated that, under different stress conditions, these enzymes might have both beneficial and detrimental effects on Drosophila cell viability.",2003,"Svetlana N Radyuk, Rajindar S Sohal, William C Orr, Svetlana N Radyuk, Rajindar S Sohal, William C Orr"
A family of genes clustered at the Triplo-lethal locus of Drosophila melanogaster has an unusual evolutionary history and significant synteny with Anopheles gambiae,14573474,,"Within the unique Triplo-lethal region (Tpl) of the Drosophila melanogaster genome we have found a cluster of 20 genes encoding a novel family of proteins. This family is also present in the Anopheles gambiae genome and displays remarkable synteny and sequence conservation with the Drosophila cluster. The family is also present in the sequenced genome of D. pseudoobscura, and homologs have been found in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and in four other insect orders, but it is not present in the sequenced genome of any noninsect species. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the cluster evolved prior to the divergence of Drosophila and Anopheles (250 MYA) and has been highly conserved since. The ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitutions and the high codon bias suggest that there has been selection on this family both for expression level and function. We hypothesize that this gene family is Tpl, name it the Osiris family, and consider possible functions. We also predict that this family of proteins, due to the unique dosage sensitivity and the lack of homologs in noninsect species, would be a good target for genetic engineering or novel insecticides.",2003,"Douglas R Dorer, Jamie A Rudnick, Etsuko N Moriyama, Alan C Christensen, Douglas R Dorer, Jamie A Rudnick, Etsuko N Moriyama, Alan C Christensen"
"The 5' untranslated region and Gag product of Idefix, a long terminal repeat-retrotransposon from Drosophila melanogaster, act together to initiate a switch between translated and untranslated states of the genomic mRNA",14585982,10.1128/mcb.23.22.8246-8254.2003,"Idefix is a long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposon present in Drosophila melanogaster which shares similarities with vertebrates retroviruses both in its genomic arrangement and in the mechanism of transposition. Like in retroviruses, its two LTRs flank a long 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) and three open reading frames referred to as the gag, pol, and env genes. Here we report that its 5'UTR, located upstream of the gag gene, can fold into highly structured domains that are known to be incompatible with efficient translation by ribosome scanning. Using dicistronic plasmids analyzed by both (i) in vitro transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte or wheat germ lysates and (ii) in vivo expression in transgenic flies, we show that the 5'UTR of Idefix exhibits an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activity that is able to promote translation of a downstream cistron in a cap-independent manner. The functional state of this novel IRES depends on eukaryotic factors that are independent of their host origin. However, in vivo, its function can be down-regulated by trans-acting factors specific to tissues or developmental stages of its host. We identify one of these trans-acting factors as the Gag protein encoded by Idefix itself. Our data support a model in which nascent Gag is able to block translation initiated from the viral mRNA and thus its own translation. These data highlight the fact that LTR-retrotransposons may autoregulate their replication cycle through their Gag production.",2003,"Carine Meignin, Jean-Luc Bailly, FrÃ©dÃ©rick Arnaud, Bernard Dastugue, Chantal Vaury, Carine Meignin, Jean-Luc Bailly, FrÃ©dÃ©rick Arnaud, Bernard Dastugue, Chantal Vaury"
Oogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster: a model system for studying cell differentiation and development,14677427,,"Drosophila oogenesis is a complex developmental process involving the coordinated differentiation of germ line and somatic cells. Correct execution and timing of cell fate specification and patterning events is achieved during this process by the integration of different cell-cell signalling pathways, eventually leading to the generation of positional information inside the oocyte, that is instrumental for the establishment of embryonic polarity. The large body of data accumulated at both cellular and molecular levels in the last decade clearly demonstrated how Drosophila oogenesis is a genetically tractable system particularly suited for the investigation of key developmental biology questions. Our recent contribution to the field relies on the characterisation of three different mutants named tegamino (teg), hold hup (hup) and tulipano (tip), identifying novel gene functions required during oogenesis.

Flies are well equipped to deal with the toxic effects of ethanol; they use it as an energy source and for lipid biosynthesis. The primary ethanol-metabolizing pathway in flies involves the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH); their role in adaptation to ethanol-rich environments has been studied extensively. The similarity between Drosophila and mammals is not restricted to the manner in which they metabolize ethanol; behaviors elicited by ethanol exposure are also remarkably similar in these organisms. Flies show signs of acute intoxication, which range from locomotor stimulation at low doses to complete sedation at higher doses, they develop tolerance upon intermittent ethanol exposure, and they appear to like ethanol, showing preference for ethanol-containing media. Molecular genetic analysis of ethanol-induced behaviors in Drosophila, while still in its early stages, has already revealed some surprising parallels with mammals. The availability of powerful tools for genetic manipulation in Drosophila, together with the high degree of conservation at the genomic level, make Drosophila a promising model organism to study the mechanism by which ethanol regulates behavior and the mechanisms underlying the organism's adaptation to long-term ethanol exposure.",2003,"Douglas J Guarnieri, Ulrike Heberlein, Douglas J Guarnieri, Ulrike Heberlein"

In transfected cells, the protein localised to nuclei, and strongly accumulated in nucleoli. SNCF was able to enhance SoxN mediated transcriptional activity in transfected cells, suggesting that SNCF might act as a SoxN co-activator.

Protein phosphatase 2A activity affects histone H3 phosphorylation and transcription in Drosophila melanogaster,12917335,10.1128/mcb.23.17.6129-6138.2003,"Transcriptional activation of the heat shock genes during the heat shock response in Drosophila has been intimately linked to phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10, whereas repression of non-heat-shock genes correlates with dephosphorylation of histone H3. It is then possible that specific kinase and/or phosphatase activities may regulate histone phosphorylation and therefore transcription activation and repression, respectively. We find that treatment of cells with strong phosphatase inhibitors interferes with the genome-wide dephosphorylation of histone H3 normally observed at non-heat-shock genes during heat shock. Mutants in protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) also display reduced genome-wide H3 dephosphorylation, and sites of H3 phosphorylation that do not contain heat shock genes remain transcriptionally active during heat shock in PP2A mutants. Finally, the SET protein, a potent and highly selective inhibitor of PP2A activity that inhibits PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of Ser10-phosphorylated H3, is detected at transcriptionally active regions of polytene chromosomes. These results suggest that activation and repression of gene expression during heat shock might be regulated by changes in PP2A activity controlled by the SET protein.",2003,"Scott J Nowak, Chi-Yun Pai, Victor G Corces, Scott J Nowak, Chi-Yun Pai, Victor G Corces"

Accordingly, the life spans of large numbers of replicate control and overexpressor lines were determined in two long-lived genetic backgrounds involving a combined total of >90,000 flies. Significant increases in the activities of both CuZn-SOD and catalase had no beneficial effect on survivorship in relatively long-lived y w mutant flies and were associated with slightly decreased life spans in wild type flies of the Oregon-R strain. The introduction of additional transgenes encoding Mn-SOD or thioredoxin reductase in the same genetic background also failed to cause life span extension.

The maintenance of the oocyte identity requires the activity of the Drosophila homologues of the Caenorhabditis elegans par genes. It was shown that the par genes are required for the first polarisation of the oocyte as early as in region 3 of the germarium.

Analysis of a shift in codon usage in Drosophila,15008418,10.1007/s00239-003-0030-3,"In order to gain further insight into a shift in codon usage first observed in Drosophila willistoni we have analyzed seven genes in six species in the lineage leading to D. willistoni. This lineage contains the willistoni and saltans species groups. Sequences were obtained from GenBank or newly sequenced for this study. All species studied showed significant difference in codon usage compared to D. melanogaster for about one third of all amino acids. Within the willistoni/saltans lineage, codon usage is homogeneous, indicating that the shift in codon usage occurred prior to the diversification of extant species in this lineage which we estimate to date to about 20 million years ago. Thus the shift is old and has been stable. We also examined introns from these genes and the G/C composition at four-fold degenerate sites in an effort to detect a change in mutation bias. There is little or no evidence for a difference in mutation bias compared to D. melanogaster. We also considered whether relaxed selection (possibly due to reduced population sizes) or reduced recombination (due to numerous naturally occurring inversions) could account for the shift and concluded these factors alone are insufficient to explain the patterns observed. A change in the relative abundance of isoaccepting tRNAs is one of the few explanations that can account for the observations. Particularly intriguing is the fact that the greatest changes in codon usage have occurred for amino acids with two-fold C/T ending codons for which it is known that posttranscriptional modification occurs in tRNAs from a G in the wobble position to Queuosine that changes optimal binding from C to a slight preference for U. However, we do not argue that this shift was adaptive in nature, rather it may be an example of a ""frozen accident.""",2003,"Jeffrey R Powell, Erminia Sezzi, Etsuko N Moriyama, Jennifer M Gleason, Adalgisa Caccone, Jeffrey R Powell, Erminia Sezzi, Etsuko N Moriyama, Jennifer M Gleason, Adalgisa Caccone"

"Heterochromatic self-association, a determinant of nuclear organization, does not require sequence homology in Drosophila",14668374,,"Chromosomes of higher eukaryotes contain blocks of heterochromatin that can associate with each other in the interphase nucleus. A well-studied example of heterochromatic interaction is the brown(Dominant) (bwD) chromosome of D. melanogaster, which contains an approximately 1.6-Mbp insertion of AAGAG repeats near the distal tip of chromosome 2. This insertion causes association of the tip with the centric heterochromatin of chromosome 2 (2h), which contains megabases of AAGAG repeats. Here we describe an example, other than bwD, in which distally translocated heterochromatin associates with centric heterochromatin. Additionally, we show that when a translocation places bwD on a different chromosome, bwD tends to associate with the centric heterochromatin of this chromosome, even when the chromosome contains a small fraction of the sequence homology present elsewhere. To further test the importance of sequence homology in these interactions, we used interspecific mating to introgress the bwD allele from D. melanogaster into D. simulans, which lacks the AAGAG on the autosomes. We find that D. simulans bwD associates with 2h, which lacks the AAGAG sequence, while it does not associate with the AAGAG containing X chromosome heterochromatin. Our results show that intranuclear association of separate heterochromatic blocks does not require that they contain the same sequence.",2003,"Brian T Sage, Amy K Csink, Brian T Sage, Amy K Csink"
Influence of female reproductive anatomy on the outcome of sperm competition in Drosophila melanogaster,12641908,10.1098/rspb.2002.2237,"Females as well as males can influence the outcome of sperm competition, and may do so through the anatomy of their reproductive tracts. Female Drosophila melanogaster store sperm in two morphologically distinct organs: a single seminal receptacle and, normally, two spermathecae. These organs have different temporal roles in sperm storage. To examine the association between sperm storage organ morphology and sperm competition, we used a mutant type of female with three spermathecae. Although the common measure of sperm competition, P(2), did not differ between females with two and three spermathecae, the pattern of sperm use over time indicated that female morphology did affect male reproductive success. The rate of offspring production by females with three spermathecae rose and fell more rapidly than by females with two spermathecae. If females remate or die before using up second male sperm, then second male reproductive success will be higher when they mate with females with three spermathecae. The results indicate that temporal patterns of sperm use as well as P(2) should be taken into account when measuring the outcome of sperm competition.",2003,"J Bangham, T Chapman, H K Smith, L Partridge, J Bangham, T Chapman, H K Smith, L Partridge"

Patterns of Hermes transposition in Drosophila melanogaster,12655404,10.1007/s00438-002-0800-4,"Transposable elements are being developed as tools for genomics and for the manipulation of insect genotypes for the purposes of biological control. An understanding of their transposition behavior will facilitate the use of these elements. The behavior of an autonomous Hermes transposable element from Musca domestica in the soma and germ-line of Drosophila melanogaster was investigated using the method of transposon display. In the germ-line, Hermes transposed at a rate of approximately 0.03 jumps per element per generation. Within the soma Hermes exhibited markedly non-random patterns of integration. Certain regions of the genome were distinctly preferred over others as integration targets, while other regions were underrepresented among the integration sites used. One particular site accounted for 4.4% of the transpositions recovered in this experiment, all of which were located within a 2.5-kb region of the actin5C promoter. This region was also present within the Hermes element itself, suggesting that this clustering is an example of transposable element ""homing"". Clusters of integration sites were also observed near the original donor sites; these represent examples of local hopping. The information content (sequence specificity) of the 8-bp target site was low, and the consensus target site resembles that determined from plasmid-based integration assays.",2003,"N Guimond, D K Bideshi, A C Pinkerton, P W Atkinson, D A O'Brochta, N Guimond, D K Bideshi, A C Pinkerton, P W Atkinson, D A O'Brochta"

Size matters: non-LTR retrotransposable elements and ectopic recombination in Drosophila,12716993,10.1093/molbev/msg102,"The Drosophila melanogaster genome contains approximately 100 distinct families of transposable elements (TEs). In the euchromatic part of the genome, each family is present in a small number of copies (5-150 copies), with individual copies of TEs often present at very low frequencies in populations. This pattern is likely to reflect a balance between the inflow of TEs by transposition and the removal of TEs by natural selection. The nature of natural selection acting against TEs remains controversial. We provide evidence that selection against chromosome abnormalities caused by ectopic recombination limits the spread of some TEs. We also demonstrate for the first time that some TE families in the Drosophila euchromatin appear to be only marginally affected by purifying selection and contain many copies at high population frequencies. We argue that TEs in these families attain high population frequencies and even reach fixation as a result of low family-wide transposition rates leading to low TE copy numbers and consequently reduced strength of selection acting on individual TE copies. Fixation of TEs in these families should provide an upward pressure on the size of intergenic sequences counterbalancing rapid DNA loss through small deletions. Copy-number-dependent selection on TE families caused by ectopic recombination may also promote diversity among TEs in the Drosophila genome.",2003,"Dmitri A Petrov, Yael T Aminetzach, Jerel C Davis, Douda Bensasson, Aaron E Hirsh, Dmitri A Petrov, Yael T Aminetzach, Jerel C Davis, Douda Bensasson, Aaron E Hirsh"

[The role of lipid-nucleic acid interactions in the reconstruction in vitro of the nuclear shell with pores],12723347,,"Previous studies of triple complexes DNA-phosphatidylcholine liposomes-Me2+ showed that, upon complexing, along with aggregation, a partial reversible fusion of liposomes takes place. In this case, DNA acts as a fusogen. The addition of the extract from Xenopus laevis or Drosophila melanogaster oocytes to the triple complex leads to a complete fusion of initial liposomes 100-200 nm in size and the formation of giant liposomes of up to 100-500 microns in size. Upon the addition of liposomes to the extract from Xenopus or Drosophila eggs, either fragments of the nuclear envelope with pores or structures like annulate lamellae are formed. The diameter of pores in these formations is approximately twice as small as in the native nuclear envelope, which may be associated with a lower surface tension of the lipid bilayer. This fact is in agreement with our model of the formation of nuclear pores suggested earlier.",2003,"V V Kuvichkin, V K Uteshev, V V Kuvichkin, V K Uteshev"
Fitness costs of Doc expression are insufficient to stabilize its copy number in Drosophila melanogaster,12679533,10.1093/molbev/msg087,"The stable coexistence of transposable elements (TEs) with their host genome over long periods of time suggests TEs have to impose some deleterious effect upon their host fitness. Three mechanisms have been proposed to account for the deleterious effect caused by TEs: host gene interruptions by TE insertions, chromosomal rearrangements by TE-induced ectopic recombination, and costly TE expression. However, the relative importance of these mechanisms remains controversial. Here, we test specifically if TE expression accounts for the host fitness cost imposed by TE insertions. In the retrotransposon Doc, expression requires binding of the host RNA polymerase to the internal promoter. If expression of Doc elements is deleterious to their host, Doc copies with promoters would be more strongly selected against and would persist in the population for shorter periods of time compared with Docs lacking promoters. We tested this prediction using sequence-specific amplified polymorphism (SSAP) analyses. We compared the populations of these two types of Doc elements in two sets of lines of Drosophila melanogaster: selection-free isogenic lines accumulating new Doc insertions and isogenized isofemale lines sampled from a natural population. We found that (1) there is no difference in the proportion of promoter-bearing and promoter-lacking copies between sets of lines, and (2) the site occupancy distribution of promoter-bearing copies does not skew toward lower frequency compared with that of promoter-lacking copies. Thus, selection against promoter-bearing copies does not appear to be stronger than that of promoter-lacking copies. Our results show that expression is not playing a major role in stabilizing Doc copy numbers.",2003,"Hsiao-Pei Yang, Sergey V Nuzhdin, Hsiao-Pei Yang, Sergey V Nuzhdin"

The study of these sequences showed that this region of mtDNA is very invariable, as regards with the type of the genes that it contains, as well as the order that they are located on it. The resulting phylogenetic trees reveal a topology that separates the species into three main ancestral lines, leading to the following subgroups: (a) ananassae subgroup, (b) montium subgroup, and (c) melanogaster and Oriental subgroups.

Contrasting selection pressures on components of the Ras-mediated signal transduction pathway in Drosophila,12694293,10.1046/j.1365-294x.2003.01741.x,"The molecular genetics of several signal transduction pathways is well characterized, providing an opportunity to address the nature of the population genetic forces acting on functionally related suites of pleiotropic regulatory genes. Signal transduction is the process by which signals are transmitted from the cell surface to the nucleus or other cellular structures. It plays a fundamental role in regulating a wide range of developmental and physiological processes, many of which are likely to be subject to buffering mechanisms. Here we infer that contrasting selection pressures act on six components of the Ras signal transduction pathway by comparing sequences obtained from 25 alleles of Drosophila melanogaster with one allele of the sibling species D. simulans. The three most upstream components of the cascade, Ras, Drk and polehole, experience strong purifying selection, as they show no fixed amino acid differences between the species and just a handful of rare replacement polymorphisms within D. melanogaster. This portion of the pathway is likely to act as a control point in signal transduction, because the more downstream components Dsor1, corkscrew and Ksr, each show several amino acid replacements between the species. Furthermore, Ksr is nearly monomorphic within D. melanogaster, and application of the HKA and McDonald and Kreitman tests indicate that this gene may have experienced a recent selective sweep, suggesting that modifiers of Ras kinase signalling are the most likely source of quantitative variation associated with this core regulatory pathway.",2003,"Rebecca M Riley, Wei Jin, Greg Gibson, Rebecca M Riley, Wei Jin, Greg Gibson"

Our genetic and biochemical analyses suggest that Rheb functions downstream of the tumour suppressors Tsc1 (tuberous sclerosis 1)-Tsc2 in the TOR (target of rapamycin) signalling pathway to control growth, and that a major effector of Rheb function is ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K).",2003,"Hugo Stocker, Thomas Radimerski, Benno Schindelholz, Franz Wittwer, Priyanka Belawat, Pierre Daram, Sebastian Breuer, George Thomas, Ernst Hafen, Hugo Stocker, Thomas Radimerski, Benno Schindelholz, Franz Wittwer, Priyanka Belawat, Pierre Daram, Sebastian Breuer, George Thomas, Ernst Hafen"
Effects of P element insertions on quantitative traits in Drosophila melanogaster,1311697,,"P element mutagenesis was used to construct 94 third chromosome lines of Drosophila melanogaster which contained on average 3.1 stable P element inserts, in an inbred host strain background previously free of P elements. The homozygous and heterozygous effects of the inserts on viability and abdominal and sternopleural bristle number were ascertained by comparing the chromosome lines with inserts to insert-free control lines of the inbred host strain. P elements reduced average homozygous viability by 12.2% per insert and average heterozygous viability by 5.5% per insert, and induced recessive lethal mutations at a rate of 3.8% per insert. Mutational variation for the bristle traits averaged over both sexes was 0.03Ve per homozygous P insert and 0.003Ve per heterozygous P insert, where Ve is the environmental variance. Mutational variation was greater for the sexes considered separately because inserts had large pleiotropic effects on sex dimorphism of bristle characters. The distributions of homozygous effects of inserts on the bristle traits were asymmetrical, with the largest effects in the direction of reducing bristle number; and highly leptokurtic, with most of the increase in variance contributed by a few lines with large effects. The inserts had partially recessive effects on the bristle traits. Insert lines with extreme bristle effects had on average greatly reduced viability.",1992,"T F Mackay, R F Lyman, M S Jackson, T F Mackay, R F Lyman, M S Jackson"
Activity labeling patterns in the medulla of Drosophila melanogaster caused by motion stimuli,1423522,10.1007/BF00381876,"We quantitatively describe 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) neuronal activity labeling patterns in the first and second visual neuropil regions of the Drosophila brain, the lamina and the medulla. Careful evaluation of activity patterns resulting from large-field motion stimulation shows that the stimulus-specific bands in the medulla correspond well to the layers found in a quantitative analysis of Golgi-impregnated columnar neurons. A systematic analysis of autoradiograms of different intensities reveals a hierarchy of labeling in the medulla. Under certain conditions, only neurons of the lamina are labeled. Their characteristic terminals in the medulla are used to differentiate among the involved lamina monopolar cell types. The 2-DG banding pattern in the medulla marks layers M1 and M5, the input layers of pathway p1 (the L1 pathway). Therefore, activity labeling of L1 by motion stimuli is very likely. More heavily labeled autoradiograms display activated cells also in layers M2, M9, and M10. The circuitry involved in the processing of motion information thus concentrates on pathways p1 and p2. Layers M4 and M6 of the distal medulla hardly display any label under the stimulus conditions used.

By contrast, flies kept at 5 g in the cross-sectional experiment had lower SLA scores at middle and old age than both 1 and 3 g-kept flies.

"There are two mechanisms of achiasmate segregation in Drosophila females, one of which requires heterochromatic homology",1304424,10.1002/dvg.1020130608,"There are numerous examples of the regular segregation of achiasmate chromosomes at meiosis I in Drosophila melanogaster females. Classically, the choice of achiasmate segregational partners has been thought to be independent of homology, but rather made on the basis of availability or similarities in size and shape. To the contrary, we show here that heterochromatic homology plays a primary role in ensuring the proper segregation of achiasmate homologs. We observe that the heterochromatin of chromosome 4 functions as, or contains, a meiotic pairing site. We show that free duplications carrying the 4th chromosome pericentric heterochromatin induce high frequencies of 4th chromosome nondisjunction regardless of their size. Moreover, a duplication from which some of the 4th chromosome heterochromatin has been removed is unable to induce 4th chromosome nondisjunction. Similarly, in the absence of either euchromatic homology or a size similarity, duplications bearing the X chromosome heterochromatin also disrupt the segregation of two achiasmate X chromosome centromeres. Although heterochromatic regions are sufficient to conjoin nonexchange homologues, we confirm that the segregation of heterologous chromosomes is determined by size, shape, and availability. The meiotic mutation Axs differentiates between these two processes of achiasmate centromere coorientation by disrupting only the homology-dependent mechanism. Thus there are two different mechanisms by which achiasmate segregational partners are chosen. We propose that the absence of diplotene-diakinesis during female meiosis allows heterochromatic pairings to persist until prometaphase and thus to co-orient homologous centromeres. We also propose that heterologous disjunctions result from a separate and homology-independent process that likely occurs during prometaphase. The latter process, which may not require the physical association of segregational partners, is similar to those observed in many insects, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in C. elegans males. We also suggest that the physical basis of this process may reflect known properties of the Drosophila meiotic spindle.",1992,"R S Hawley, H Irick, A E Zitron, D A Haddox, A Lohe, C New, M D Whitley, T Arbel, J Jang, K McKim, R S Hawley, H Irick, A E Zitron, D A Haddox, A Lohe, C New, M D Whitley, T Arbel, J Jang, K McKim"
Aminergic neurons in the brain of blowflies and Drosophila: dopamine- and tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons and their relationship with putative histaminergic neurons,1346506,10.1007/BF00318701,"The distribution and morphology of neurons reacting with antisera against dopamine (DA), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and histamine (HA) were analyzed in the blowflies Calliphora erythrocephala and Phormia terraenovae. TH-immunoreactive (THIR) and HA-immunoreactive (HAIR) neurons were also mapped in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. The antisera against DA and TH specifically labeled the same neurons in the blowflies. About 300 neurons displayed DA immunoreactivity (DAIR) and THIR in the brain and subesophageal ganglion of the blowflies. Most of these neurons were located in bilateral clusters; some were distributed as bilateral pairs, and two ventral unpaired median (VUM) neurons were seen in the subesophageal ganglion. Immunoreactive processes were found in all compartments of the mushroom bodies except the calyces, in all divisions of the central body complex, in the medulla, lobula and lobula plate of the optic lobe, and in non-glomerular neuropil of protocerebrum, tritocerebrum and the subesophageal ganglion. No DA or TH immunoreactivity was seen in the antennal lobes. In Drosophila, neurons homologous to the blowfly neurons were detected with the TH antiserum. In Phormia and Drosophila, 18 HA-immunoreactive neurons were located in the protocerebrum and 2 in the subesophageal ganglion. The HAIR neurons arborized extensively, but except for processes in the lobula, all HAIR processes were seen in non-glomerular neuropil. The deuto- and tritocerebrum was devoid of HAIR processes. Double labeling experiments demonstrated that TH and HA immunoreactivity was not colocalized in any neuron. In some regions there was, however, substantial superposition between the two systems.

Delineation of cis-acting sequences required for expression of Drosophila mojavensis Adh-1,1317314,,"The control of expression of the Adh-1 gene of Drosophila mojavensis has been analyzed by transforming ADH null Drosophila melanogaster hosts with P element constructs which contain D. mojavensis Adh-1 having deletions of different extent in the 5' and 3' ends. Adh-1 expression in the D. melanogaster hosts is qualitatively similar to expression in D. mojavensis, although expression is quantitatively lower in transformants. Deletions of the 5' end indicate that information required for normal temporal and tissue expression in larvae is contained within 70 bp of the transcription start site. However, deletion constructs to -70 are deficient in ovarian nurse cell expression, whereas the additional upstream sequences present in constructs containing deletions to -257 do support expression in the ovary. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence in the -257 to -70 region of Adh-1 of four species: D. mojavensis and Drosophila arizona, which express Adh-1 in the ovary, and Drosophila mulleri and Drosophila navojoa, which do not, has led to the identification of regions of sequence similarity that correlate with ovary expression. One of these bears a striking similarity to a conserved sequence located upstream of the three heat shock genes that have constitutive ovarian expression and may be an ovarian control element. We have identified an aberrant aspect of Adh-1 expression. In transformants which carry an Adh-1 gene without a functional upstream Adh-2 gene Adh-1 expression continues into the adult stage instead of ceasing at the onset of metamorphosis.

Multiple cis-acting sequences contribute to evolved regulatory variation for Drosophila Adh genes,1644276,,"Drosophila affinidisjuncta and Drosophila hawaiiensis are closely related species that display distinct tissue-specific expression patterns for their homologous alcohol dehydrogenase genes (Adh genes). In Drosophila melanogaster transformants, both genes are expressed at high levels in the larval and adult fat bodies, but the D. affinidisjuncta gene is expressed 10-50-fold more strongly in the larval and adult midguts and Malpighian tubules. The present study reports the mapping of cis-acting sequences contributing to the regulatory differences between these two genes in transformants. Chimeric genes were constructed and introduced into the germ line of D. melanogaster. Stage- and tissue-specific expression patterns were determined by measuring steady-state RNA levels in larvae and adults. Three portions of the promoter region make distinct contributions to the tissue-specific regulatory differences between the native genes. Sequences immediately upstream of the distal promoter have a strong effect in the adult Malpighian tubules, while sequences between the two promoters are relatively important in the larval Malpighian tubules. A third gene segment, immediately upstream of the proximal promoter, influences levels of the proximal Adh transcript in all tissues and developmental stages examined, and largely accounts for the regulatory difference in the larval and adult midguts. However, these as well as other sequences make smaller contributions to various aspects of the tissue-specific regulatory differences. In addition, some chimeric genes display aberrant RNA levels for the whole organism, suggesting close physical association between sequences involved in tissue-specific regulatory differences and those important for Adh expression in the larval and adult fat bodies.",1992,"X M Fang, M D Brennan, X M Fang, M D Brennan"
Performance of a kinetic model for intracellular ice formation based on the extent of supercooling,1499321,10.1016/0011-2240(92)90037-3,"Cryomicroscopy was used to study the incidence of intracellular ice formation (IIF) in protoplasts isolated from rye (Secale cereale) leaves during subfreezing isothermal periods and in in vitro mature bovine oocytes during cooling at constant rates. IIF in protoplasts occurred at random times during isothermal periods, and the kinetics of IIF were faster as isothermal temperature decreased. Mean IIF times decreased from approximately 1700 s at -4.0 degrees C to less than 1 s at -18.5 degrees C. Total incidence of IIF after 200 s increased from 4% at -4.0 degrees C to near 100% at -15.5 degrees C. IIF behavior in protoplasts was qualitatively similar to that for Drosophila melanogaster embryos over the same temperature ranges (Myers et al., Cryobiology 26, 472-484, 1989), but the kinetics of IIF were about five times faster in protoplasts. IIF observations in linear cooling of bovine oocytes indicated a median IIF temperature of -11 degrees C at 16 degrees C/min and total incidences of 97%, 50%, and 19% at 16, 8, and 4 degrees C/min, respectively. A stochastic model of IIF was developed which preserved certain features of an earlier model (Pitt et al. Cryobiology 28, 72-86, 1991), namely Weibull behavior in IIF temperatures during rapid linear cooling, but with a departure from the concept of a supercooling tolerance. Instead, the new model uses the osmotic state of the cell, represented by the extent of supercooling, as the independent variable governing the kinetics of IIF. Two kinetic parameters are needed for the model: a scale factor tau 0 dictating the sensitivity to supercooling, and an exponent rho dictating the strength of time dependency. The model was fit to the data presented in this study as well as those from Myers et al. and Pitt et al. for D. melanogaster embryos with and without cryoprotectant, and from Toner et al. (Cryobiology 28, 55-71, 1991) for mouse oocytes. In protoplasts, D. melanogaster embryos, and mouse oocytes, the parameters were estimated from IIF times in the early stages of isothermal periods, while the osmotic state of the cell was relatively constant. In bovine oocytes, the parameters were estimated from linear cooling data. Without further calibration, the model was used to predict total IIF incidence under different cooling regimes. For protoplasts, D. melanogaster embryos, and bovine oocytes, the model's predictions were quite accurate compared to the actual data. In mouse oocytes, adjustment of the hydraulic permeability coefficient (Lp) at 0 degree C was required to yield realistic behavior.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1992,"R E Pitt, M Chandrasekaran, J E Parks, R E Pitt, M Chandrasekaran, J E Parks"

This supports the notion of a mortality cost of reproduction in Drosophila. The total number of eggs laid per lifetime did not differ between the two groups. The percentage of offspring hatched started at normal levels (about 50% of eggs laid), then declined rapidly in large flies.

One of the fragments is truncated only 140bp downstream from the promoter. Insertions of all three fragments proved capable of stimulating X-Y disjunction. Double insertions were substantially more effective than single insertions. RNA/PCR analysis was used to show that transcripts initiated at the inserted rDNA promoters are present in testis RNA from all insertions. Treatment with an antinucleolar antibody revealed that none of the insertions was associated with a mininucleolus. Thus promoter-containing rDNA fragments are autonomously capable of being transcribed and of functioning as X-Y pairing sites, but not of forming a mini-nucleolus.",1992,"C J Merrill, D Chakravarti, L Habera, S Das, L Eisenhour, B D McKee, C J Merrill, D Chakravarti, L Habera, S Das, L Eisenhour, B D McKee"
"Molecular cloning and characterization of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor in Drosophila melanogaster",1322910,,"We isolated a cDNA encoding an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) of Drosophila melanogaster. The predicted Drosophila InsP3R (2,833 amino acids) has extensive sequence similarity to the mouse InsP3R. The polypeptide encoded by the cDNA was functionally expressed and showed characteristic InsP3-binding activity. The Drosophila InsP3R gene is located at the region 83A5-9 on the third chromosome and expresses throughout development but predominantly in the adult. Localization of the InsP3R mRNA in adult tissues suggests strong expression in the retina and antenna, indicating the involvement of the InsP3R in visual and olfactory transduction. In addition, the InsP3R mRNA is abundant in the legs and thorax, which are enriched with a muscular system. Such localization is apparently consistent with the quantitatively predominant sites for [3H]InsP3 binding in Drosophila and the fleshfly (Boettcherisca peregrina). The present study points to the likely functional importance of the InsP3/Ca2+ signaling system in Drosophila.",1992,"S Yoshikawa, T Tanimura, A Miyawaki, M Nakamura, M Yuzaki, T Furuichi, K Mikoshiba, S Yoshikawa, T Tanimura, A Miyawaki, M Nakamura, M Yuzaki, T Furuichi, K Mikoshiba"
Oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,1311850,10.1073/pnas.89.5.1735,"An efficient technique has been developed for performing in vivo site-directed mutagenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. This procedure involves directed repair of P-element-induced DNA lesions after injection of a modified DNA sequence into early embryos. An oligonucleotide of 50 base pairs, whose sequence spans the P-element insertion site, mediates base replacement in the endogenous gene. Restriction mapping, DNA sequencing, and polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrate that base substitutions present in an injected oligonucleotide are incorporated into genomic sequences flanking a P insertion site in the white gene. This analysis suggests that progeny bearing directed mutations are recovered with a frequency of about 0.5 x 10(-3). Because Drosophila remains a premier organism for the analysis of eukaryotic gene regulation, this system should find strong application in that analysis as well as in the analysis of DNA recombination, conversion, repair, and mutagenesis.",1992,"S S Banga, J B Boyd, S S Banga, J B Boyd"
Comparative evolution of P-M system and infection by the sigma virus in French and Spanish populations of Drosophila melanogaster,1334901,10.1017/s0016672300030779,"In 1983, an extensive survey of populations of D. melanogaster was started in a southern French region (Languedoc) in two non-Mendelian systems: the P-M system of transposable elements and the hereditary Rhabdovirus sigma. Unexpectedly fast-evolving phenomena were observed and interesting correlations were noted, giving similar geographical pattern to the region in both systems. For these reasons, the analysis was continued and extended towards the north (RhÃ´ne Valley) and the south (Spain). In the P-M system, all the Languedoc populations evolved from 1983 to 1991 towards the Q type which is characteristic of the RhÃ´ne Valley populations. In contrast, M' strains are currently observed in the southernmost French populations and in all Spanish ones, so that there is a clear pattern in their geographical distribution. The frequency of flies infected by the sigma virus dramatically increased from 1983 to 1988 in Languedoc; this increase was clearly correlated with some viral characteristics. But, in northern France, similar characteristics did not trigger any increase in the frequency of infected flies. The data presented here show that the distinctive features of Languedoc extend northwards through the RhÃ´ne Valley up to Lyon and disappears southwards before the Spanish border.",1992,"A Fleuriet, R Kalmes, L Pascual, G Periquet, A Fleuriet, R Kalmes, L Pascual, G Periquet"

The model demonstrates that, if heterozygosity for an inversion effectively reduces element associated production of detrimental chromosome rearrangements, a differential accumulation of elements is expected, with increased copy number inside the minority inversion. Several-fold differential accumulations are possible with certain parameter values. We present data on P element counts for inversion polymorphisms on all five chromosome arms of 157 haploid genomes from two African populations. Our observations show significantly increased numbers of elements within the regions associated with the least common, or minority arrangements, in natural inversion polymorphisms.",1992,"W F Eanes, C Wesley, B Charlesworth, W F Eanes, C Wesley, B Charlesworth"

Line D2 was also subdivided into two other lines, SA and ASD, based on their different bristle patterns. The SA line was selected for two symmetrical anterior extra bristles, and the ASD line was selected for two asymmetrical extra bristles, one anterior and one posterior. Only the SA line showed any canalizing response (estimated by the width of the probit transformation) at the two-extra-bristle class. Nevertheless, the results from the different lines were more consistent with the independent ones of both the anterior and posterior regions of the extra dorsocentral bristles. This analysis showed some independent genetic systems for each region, developmental canalization being at two extra symmetrical bristles per region in all the selected lines (D2, ASD, and SA). Therefore, this canalization did not depend directly on the extra-bristle positional pattern used in the selection. The wild-type canalizing system is suggested to explain the fast canalizing response in a phenotype that had not been previously canalized by natural selection.",1992,"R PiÃ±eiro, R PiÃ±eiro"

Early duplication and functional diversification of the opsin gene family in insects,15155799,10.1093/molbev/msh162,"Recent analysis of the complete mosquito Anopheles gambiae genome has revealed a far higher number of opsin genes than for either the Drosophila melanogaster genome or any other known insect. In particular, the analysis revealed an extraordinary opsin gene content expansion, whereby half are long wavelength-sensitive (LW) opsin gene duplicates. We analyzed this genomic data in relationship to other known insect opsins to estimate the relative timing of the LW opsin gene duplications and to identify ""missing"" paralogs in extant species. The inferred branching patterns of the LW opsin gene family phylogeny indicate at least one early gene duplication within insects before the emergence of the orders Orthoptera, Mantodea, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera. These data predict the existence of one more LW opsin gene than is currently known from most insects. We tested this prediction by using a degenerate PCR strategy to screen the hymenopteran genome for novel LW opsin genes. We isolated two LW opsin gene sequences from each of five bee species, Bombus impatiens, B. terrestris, Diadasia afflicta, D. rinconis, and Osmia rufa, including 1.1 to 1.2 kb from a known (LW Rh1) and 1 kb from a new opsin gene (LW Rh2). Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the novel hymenopteran gene is orthologous to A. gambiae GPRop7, a gene that is apparently missing from D. melanogaster. Relative rate tests show that LW Rh2 is evolving at a slower rate than LW Rh1 and, therefore, may be a useful marker for higher-level hymenopteran systematics. Site-specific rate tests indicate the presence of several amino acid sites between LW Rh1 and LW Rh2 that have undergone shifts in selective constraints after duplication. These sites and others are discussed in relationship to putative structural and functional differences between the two genes.",2004,"Johannes Spaethe, Adriana D Briscoe, Johannes Spaethe, Adriana D Briscoe"

RNA interference is becoming an efficient reverse genetic tool for studying gene function in model organisms, including C.elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Our molecular evolutionary study has shown that a prototype of glycosyltransferases, which synthesize a variety of glycan structures in the Golgi apparatus, was conserved between mammals and Drosophila. For analyses of the basic physiological functions of glycans, we established the Drosophila inducible RNAi knockdown system and applied it to one glycosyltransferase and one transporter, proteoglycan UDP-galactose: beta-xylose beta1,4galactosyltransferase I and the PAPS-transporter, respectively. If on the silencing of each gene induced ubiquitously under the control of a cytoplasmic actin promoter, the RNAi knockdown fly died, then the protein was indispensable for life. The expression of the target gene was disrupted specifically and the degree of interference was well correlated with the phenotype. The inducible RNAi knockdown fly obtained using the GAL4-UAS system will pave the way for the functional analysis of glycans.",2004,"Shoko Nishihara, Ryu Ueda, Satoshi Goto, Hidenao Toyoda, Hideki Ishida, Mitsuru Nakamura, Shoko Nishihara, Ryu Ueda, Satoshi Goto, Hidenao Toyoda, Hideki Ishida, Mitsuru Nakamura"

We have developed a maximum-likelihood method to do this and have applied our method to several data sets from three Drosophila species: D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. yakuba. The estimated number of adaptive substitutions per codon is not uniformly distributed among genes, but follows a leptokurtic distribution. However, the proportion of amino acid substitutions fixed by adaptive evolution seems to be remarkably constant across the genome (i.e., the proportion of amino acid substitutions that are adaptive appears to be the same in fast-evolving and slow-evolving genes; fast-evolving genes have higher numbers of both adaptive and neutral substitutions). Our estimates do not seem to be significantly biased by selection on synonymous codon use or by the assumption of independence among sites. Nevertheless, an accurate estimate is hampered by the existence of slightly deleterious mutations and variations in effective population size. The analysis of several Drosophila data sets suggests that approximately 25% +/- 20% of amino acid substitutions were driven by positive selection in the divergence between D. simulans and D. yakuba.",2004,"Nicolas Bierne, Adam Eyre-Walker, Nicolas Bierne, Adam Eyre-Walker"
Quantitative genetics of functional characters in Drosophila melanogaster populations subjected to laboratory selection,15689629,10.1007/BF02717896,"What are the genetics of phenotypes other than fitness, in outbred populations? To answer this question, the quantitative-genetic basis of divergence was characterized for outbred Drosophila melanogaster populations that had previously undergone selection to enhance characters related to fitness. Line-cross analysis using first-generation and second-generation hybrids from reciprocal crosses was conducted for two types of cross, each replicated fivefold. One type of cross was between representatives of the ancestral population, a set of five populations maintained for several hundred generations on a two-week discrete-generation life cycle and a set of five populations adapted to starvation stress. The other type of cross was between the same set of ancestral-representative populations and another set of five populations selected for accelerated development from egg to egg. Developmental time from egg to eclosion, starvation resistance, dry body weight and fecundity at day 14 from egg were fit to regression models estimating single-locus additive and dominant effects, maternal and paternal effects, and digenic additive and dominance epistatic effects. Additive genetic variation explained most of the differences between populations, with additive maternal and cytoplasmic effects also commonly found. Both within-locus and between-locus dominance effects were inferred in some cases, as well as one instance of additive epistasis. Some of these effects may have been caused by linkage disequilibrium.

Variable fitness effects of Wolbachia infection in Drosophila melanogaster,15305172,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800514,"Maternally inherited Wolbachia bacteria are extremely widespread among insects and their presence is usually associated with parasitic modifications of host fitness. Wolbachia pipientis infects Drosophila melanogaster populations from all continents, but their persistence in this species occurs despite any strong parasitic effects. Here, we have investigated the symbiosis between Wolbachia and D. melanogaster and found that Wolbachia infection can have significant survival and fecundity effects. Relative to uninfected flies, infected females from three fly strains showed enhanced survival or fecundity associated with Wolbachia infection, one strain showed both and one strain responded positively to Wolbachia removal. We found no difference in egg hatch rates (cytoplasmic incompatibility) for crosses between infected males and uninfected females, although there were fecundity differences. Females from this cross consistently produced fewer eggs than infected females and these fecundity differences could promote the spread of infection just like cytoplasmic incompatibility. More surprising, we found that infected females often had the greatest fecundity when mated to uninfected males. This could also promote the spread of Wolbachia infection, though here the fitness benefits would also help to spread infection when Wolbachia are rare. We suggest that variable fitness effects, in both sexes, and which interact strongly with the genetic background of the host, could increase cytoplasmic drive rates in some genotypes and help explain the widespread persistence of Wolbachia bacteria in D. melanogaster populations. These interactions may further explain why many D. melanogaster populations are polymorphic for Wolbachia infection. We discuss our results in the context of host-symbiont co-evolution.",2004,"A J Fry, M R Palmer, D M Rand"
Phylogenomics of the reproductive parasite Wolbachia pipientis wMel: a streamlined genome overrun by mobile genetic elements,15024419,10.1371/journal.pbio.0020069,"The complete sequence of the 1,267,782 bp genome of Wolbachia pipientis wMel, an obligate intracellular bacteria of Drosophila melanogaster, has been determined. Wolbachia, which are found in a variety of invertebrate species, are of great interest due to their diverse interactions with different hosts, which range from many forms of reproductive parasitism to mutualistic symbioses. Analysis of the wMel genome, in particular phylogenomic comparisons with other intracellular bacteria, has revealed many insights into the biology and evolution of wMel and Wolbachia in general. For example, the wMel genome is unique among sequenced obligate intracellular species in both being highly streamlined and containing very high levels of repetitive DNA and mobile DNA elements. This observation, coupled with multiple evolutionary reconstructions, suggests that natural selection is somewhat inefficient in wMel, most likely owing to the occurrence of repeated population bottlenecks. Genome analysis predicts many metabolic differences with the closely related Rickettsia species, including the presence of intact glycolysis and purine synthesis, which may compensate for an inability to obtain ATP directly from its host, as Rickettsia can. Other discoveries include the apparent inability of wMel to synthesize lipopolysaccharide and the presence of the most genes encoding proteins with ankyrin repeat domains of any prokaryotic genome yet sequenced. Despite the ability of wMel to infect the germline of its host, we find no evidence for either recent lateral gene transfer between wMel and D. melanogaster or older transfers between Wolbachia and any host. Evolutionary analysis further supports the hypothesis that mitochondria share a common ancestor with the alpha-Proteobacteria, but shows little support for the grouping of mitochondria with species in the order Rickettsiales. With the availability of the complete genomes of both species and excellent genetic tools for the host, the wMel-D. melanogaster symbiosis is now an ideal system for studying the biology and evolution of Wolbachia infections.",2004,"Martin Wu, Ling V Sun, Jessica Vamathevan, Markus Riegler, Robert Deboy, Jeremy C Brownlie, Elizabeth A McGraw, William Martin, Christian Esser, Nahal Ahmadinejad, Christian Wiegand, Ramana Madupu, Maureen J Beanan, Lauren M Brinkac, Sean C Daugherty, A Scott Durkin, James F Kolonay, William C Nelson, Yasmin Mohamoud, Perris Lee, Kristi Berry, M Brook Young, Teresa Utterback, Janice Weidman, William C Nierman, Ian T Paulsen, Karen E Nelson, HervÃ© Tettelin, Scott L O'Neill, Jonathan A Eisen, Martin Wu, Ling V Sun, Jessica Vamathevan, Markus Riegler, Robert Deboy, Jeremy C Brownlie, Elizabeth A McGraw, William Martin, Christian Esser, Nahal Ahmadinejad, Christian Wiegand, Ramana Madupu, Maureen J Beanan, Lauren M Brinkac, Sean C Daugherty, A Scott Durkin, James F Kolonay, William C Nelson, Yasmin Mohamoud, Perris Lee, Kristi Berry, M Brook Young, Teresa Utterback, Janice Weidman, William C Nierman, Ian T Paulsen, Karen E Nelson, HervÃ© Tettelin, Scott L O'Neill, Jonathan A Eisen"

An efficient method to generate chromosomal rearrangements by targeted DNA double-strand breaks in Drosophila melanogaster,15197166,10.1101/gr.2279804,"Homologous recombination (HR) is an indispensable tool to modify the genome of yeast and mammals. More recently HR is also being used for gene targeting in Drosophila. Here we show that HR can be used efficiently to engineer chromosomal rearrangements such as pericentric and paracentric inversions and translocations in Drosophila. Two chromosomal double-strand breaks (DSBs), introduced by the rare-cutting I-SceI endonuclease on two different mobile elements sharing homologous sequences, are sufficient to promote rearrangements at a frequency of 1% to 4%. Such rearrangements, once generated by HR, can be reverted by Cre recombinase. However, Cre-mediated recombination efficiency drops with increasing distance between recombination sites, unlike HR. We therefore speculate that physical constraints on chromosomal movement are modulated during DSB repair, to facilitate the homology search throughout the genome.",2004,"Dieter Egli, Ernst Hafen, Walter Schaffner, Dieter Egli, Ernst Hafen, Walter Schaffner"

Peptidomic and proteomic analyses of the systemic immune response of Drosophila,15556270,10.1016/j.biochi.2004.07.007,"Insects have developed an efficient host defense against microorganisms, which involves humoral and cellular mechanisms. Numerous data highlight similarities between defense responses of insects and innate immunity of mammals. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a favorable model system for the analysis of the first line defense against microorganisms. Taking advantages of improvements in mass spectrometry (MS), two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and bioinformatics, differential analyses of blood content (hemolymph) from immune-challenged versus control Drosophila were performed. Two strategies were developed: (i) peptidomic analyses through matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS and high performance liquid chromatography for molecules below 15 kDa, and (ii) proteomic studies based on 2D gel electrophoresis, MALDI-TOF fingerprinting and database searches, for compounds of greater molecular masses. The peptidomic strategy led to the detection of a large number of peptides induced in the hemolymph of challenged flies as compared to controls. Of these, 28 were characterized, amongst which were antimicrobial peptides. The 2D gel electrophoresis strategy led to the detection of 70 spots differentially regulated by at least fivefold after microbial infection. This approach yielded the identity of a series of proteins that were related to the Drosophila immune response, such as proteases, protease inhibitors, prophenoloxydase-activating enzymes, serpins and a Gram-negative binding protein-like protein. This strategy also brought to light new candidates with a potential function in the immune response (odorant-binding protein, peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase and transferrin). Interestingly, several molecules resulting from the cleavage of proteins were detected after a fungal infection.

Regulation of copulation duration by period and timeless in Drosophila melanogaster,15324667,10.1016/j.cub.2004.08.022,"The circadian clock involves several clock genes encoding interacting transcriptional regulators. Mutations in clock genes in Drosophila melanogaster, period (per), timeless (tim), Clock (Clk), and cycle (cyc), produce multiple phenotypes associated with physiology, behavior, development, and morphology. It is not clear whether these genes always work as clock components or may also act in some unknown pleiotropic fashion. We report here that per and tim are involved in a novel, male-specific phenotype that affects behavioral timing on the order of minutes. Males lacking per or tim copulate significantly longer than males with normal per or tim function, while females do not show this effect. No correlation between fertility and extended copulation duration was found. Several lines of evidence suggest that the time in copula (TIC) is not regulated by the known clock mechanism. First, the period of free-running clock oscillations does not appear to affect this phenotype. Second, constant light, which abolishes the clock function, does not alter TIC. Finally, mutations in the positively acting clock transcription factors, Clk and cyc, do not affect TIC.

Unique self-sustaining circadian oscillators within the brain of Drosophila melanogaster,15332440,10.1081/cbi-120038597,"In Drosophila circadian rhythms persist in constant darkness (DD). The small ventral Lateral Neurons (s-LNv) mainly control the behavioral circadian rhythm in consortium with the large ventral Lateral Neurons (l-LNv) and dorsal Lateral Neurons (LNd). It is believed that the molecular oscillations of clock genes are the source of this persistent behavior. Indeed the s-LNv, LNd, Dorsal Neurons (DN)-DN2 and DN3 displayed self-sustained molecular oscillations in DD both at RNA and protein levels, except the DN2 oscillates in anti-phase. In contrast, the l-LNv and DN1 displayed self-sustained oscillations at the RNA level, but protein oscillations quickly dampened. Having self-sustained and dampened molecular oscillators together in the DN groups suggested that they play different roles. However, all DN groups seemed to contribute together to the light-dark (LD) behavioral rhythm. The LD entrainment of LN oscillators is achieved through Rhodopsin (RH) and Cryptochrome (CRY). CRY's expression in all DN groups implicates also its role in LD entrainment of DN, like in DN1. However, mutations in cry and glass that did not inflict LD synchronization of the DN2, DN3 oscillator implicate the existence of a novel photoreceptor at least in DN3.",2004,"Shobi Veleri, Corinna WÃ¼lbeck, Shobi Veleri, Corinna WÃ¼lbeck"
Sperm death and dumping in Drosophila,15118726,10.1038/nature02455,"Mating with more than one male is the norm for females of many species. In addition to generating competition between the ejaculates of different males, multiple mating may allow females to bias sperm use. In Drosophila melanogaster, the last male to inseminate a female sires approximately 80% of subsequent progeny. Both sperm displacement, where resident sperm are removed from storage by the incoming ejaculate of the copulating male, and sperm incapacitation, where incoming seminal fluids supposedly interfere with resident sperm, have been implicated in this pattern of sperm use. But the idea of incapacitation is problematic because there are no known mechanisms by which an individual could damage rival sperm and not their own. Females also influence the process of sperm use, but exactly how is unclear. Here we show that seminal fluids do not kill rival sperm and that any 'incapacitation' is probably due to sperm ageing during sperm storage. We also show that females release stored sperm from the reproductive tract (sperm dumping) after copulation with a second male and that this requires neither incoming sperm nor seminal fluids. Instead, males may cause stored sperm to be dumped or females may differentially eject sperm from the previous mating.",2004,"Rhonda R Snook, David J Hosken, Rhonda R Snook, David J Hosken"

Here we describe an uncharacterized cytochrome P450 gene, designated Cyp306a1, that is essential for ecdysteroid biosynthesis in the PGs of the silkworm Bombyx mori and fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Using the microarray technique for analyzing gene expression profiles in PG cells during Bombyx development, we identified two PG-specific P450 genes whose temporal expression patterns are correlated with changes in ecdysteroid titer during development. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that one of the Bombyx P450 genes belongs to the CYP306A1 subfamily. The temporal and spatial expression pattern of the Drosophila Cyp306a1 homolog is essentially the same as that of Bombyx Cyp306a1. We also found that Drosophila Cyp306a1 is disrupted in the phantom (phm) mutant, known also as the Halloween mutant. The morphological defects and decreased expression of ecdysone-inducible genes in phm suggest that this mutant cannot produce a high titer of ecdysone. Finally we demonstrate that S2 cells transfected with Cyp306a1 convert ketodiol to ketotriol via carbon 25 hydroxylation. These results strongly suggest that CYP306A1 functions as a carbon 25 hydroxylase and has an essential role in ecdysteroid biosynthesis during insect development.",2004,"Ryusuke Niwa, Takahiro Matsuda, Takuji Yoshiyama, Toshiki Namiki, Kazuei Mita, Yoshinori Fujimoto, Hiroshi Kataoka, Ryusuke Niwa, Takahiro Matsuda, Takuji Yoshiyama, Toshiki Namiki, Kazuei Mita, Yoshinori Fujimoto, Hiroshi Kataoka"
The cAMP transduction cascade mediates olfactory reception in Drosophila melanogaster,15082937,10.1023/B:BEGE.0000023645.02710.fe,"Two main second messenger systems depending on IP3 and cAMP have been related to olfaction in vertebrates as well as invertebrates. In Drosophila melanogaster, the availability of mutations affecting one or the other pathway (rdgB and norpA or rut and dnc, respectively) allowed showing of abnormal olfactory behavior phenotypes associated with olfactory transduction in complete living animals. However, because rut and dnc genes showed ubiquitous expression at olfactory receptor organs and some brain locations, the mutant behavior cannot be assigned exclusively to olfactory reception. In this report, overexpression of the dnc gene directed specifically to different olfactory receptor neuron subsets was used to produce dominant mutants. Abnormal olfactory behavior was found in 62.5% of the 8 lines studied in response to some odorants, depending on the affected neuronal subset. These results suggest that even for a small number of tested odorants (5), cAMP cascade is involved in olfactory reception to an important extent.",2004,"Carolina Gomez-Diaz, Fernando Martin, Esther Alcorta, Carolina Gomez-Diaz, Fernando Martin, Esther Alcorta"

Lack of correlation between body mass and metabolic rate in Drosophila melanogaster,15121458,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2004.03.002,"We examined the association between body mass and metabolic rate in Drosophila melanogaster under a variety of conditions.

In addition, the relationship between body mass and metabolic rate was determined for flies recently collected from wild populations. In no case was there a significant correlation between body mass and metabolic rate. These results indicate that care must be taken when attempting to account for the effects of body mass on metabolic rate.

The contribution by mitochondrially induced oxidative damage to aging in Drosophila melanogaster,15190188,10.1023/B:BGEN.0000031156.75376.e3,"Strains of Drosophila melanogaster have been generated that vary in the mitochondrial genome and have a common nuclear genome. Tetracycline was used to cure the strains of the endocommensal bacteria, Wolbachia, which is transmitted maternally. Variation in the tetracycline responsive agent contributed substantially to variation in longevity and production of metabolic oxidants. Changes in diurnal cycle of activity have been investigated: such changes should be responsive to metabolism-related damage because of the role of the very active neurons, retinal cells and muscle. The metabolic oxidant model predicts that longevity and production of metabolic oxidants should be negatively correlated, and that deterioration of behavior with age and metabolic oxidant production should be positively correlated. Only the first prediction was verified: rate of change in behavior correlated with metabolic oxidants, consistent with a role of metabolic oxidants in this age-related change. However, the data indicates a role for mitochondria in determination longevity, other than by production of metabolic oxidants.",2004,"Christopher Driver, Angela Georgiou, George Georgiou, Christopher Driver, Angela Georgiou, George Georgiou"
Characterization of conditionally expressed mutants affecting age-specific survival in inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster: lethal conditions and temperature-sensitive periods,15280238,10.1534/genetics.103.023721,"The specific genetic basis of inbreeding depression is poorly understood. To address this question, two conditionally expressed lethal effects that were found to cause line-specific life span reductions in two separate inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster were characterized phenotypically and genetically in terms of whether the accelerated mortality effects are dominant or recessive. The mortality effect in one line (I4) is potentially a temperature-sensitive semilethal that expresses in adult males only and is partially dominant. The other line (I10) responds as one would expect for a recessive lethal. It requires a cold shock for expression and is cold sensitive. Flies exhibiting this lethal condition responded as pupae and freshly eclosed imagoes. The effect is recessive in both males and females. The expression of the lethal effects in both lines is highly dependent upon environmental conditions. These results will serve as a basis for more detailed and mechanistic genetic research on inbreeding depression and are relevant to sex- and environment-specific effects on life span observed in quantitative trait loci studies using inbred lines.",2004,"C J Vermeulen, R Bijlsma, C J Vermeulen, R Bijlsma"
A genome-wide analysis of courting and mating responses in Drosophila melanogaster females,15499404,10.1139/g04-050,"In Drosophila melanogaster, seminal fluid proteins influence several components of female physiology and behavior, including re-mating rates, ovulation and oviposition, and sperm use. It is well-known that female flies are not simply passive vessels and that female-mediated interactions with male products are important to female (and thus male) reproductive success. While the population genetics, molecular evolution and physiological effects of seminal fluid proteins have been examined, the genetics and evolution of the female side of these post-mating interactions is unexplored in spite of work showing that female genotype and female-by-male genotype interactions are important determinants of sperm competition outcomes. Here we use microarrays to identify candidate genes involved in the female side of post-mating sexual interactions. We report the results of a whole-genome oligonucleotide chip experiment that reveals 23 genes differentially expressed between virgin females exposed and unexposed to courting males, and 38 genes differentially expressed between virgin and recently mated females. Immune related genes are overrepresented among the mating-influenced candidates. We use quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR to independently assess gene expression changes for roughly half of the mating-affected candidate genes.",2004,"Mara K N Lawniczak, David J Begun, Mara K N Lawniczak, David J Begun"
FB elements can promote exon shuffling: a promoter-less white allele can be reactivated by FB mediated transposition in Drosophila melanogaster,15060822,10.1007/s00438-004-1007-7,"Foldback ( FB) elements are transposable elements found in many eukaryotic genomes; they are thought to contribute significantly to genome plasticity. In Drosophila melanogaster, FBs have been shown to be involved in the transposition of large chromosomal regions and in the genetic instability of some alleles of the white gene. In this report we show that FB mediated transposition of w(67C23), a mutation that deletes the promoter of the white gene and its first exon, containing the start codon, can restore expression of the white gene. We have characterized three independent events in which a 14-kb fragment from the w(67C23) locus was transposed into an intron region in three different genes. In each case a local promoter drives the expression of white, producing a chimeric mRNA.

Mutations in Su(var)205 and Su(var)3-7 suppress P-element-dependent silencing in Drosophila melanogaster,15579693,10.1534/genetics.104.026914,"In Drosophila melanogaster, the w(+) transgene in P[lacW]ci(Dplac) is uniformly expressed throughout the adult eye. However, when other P elements are present, this w(+) transgene is randomly silenced and this produces a variegated eye phenotype. This P-element-dependent silencing (PDS) is limited to w(+) transgenes inserted in a specific region on chromosome 4. In a screen for genetic modifiers of PDS, we isolated mutations in Su(var)205, Su(var)3-7, and two unidentified genes that suppress this variegated phenotype. Therefore, only a few of the genes encoding heterochromatic modifiers act dose dependently in PDS. In addition, we recovered two spontaneous mutations of P[lacW]ci(Dplac) that variegate in the absence of P elements. These P[lacW]i(Dplac) derivatives have a gypsy element inserted proximally to the P[lacW]ci(Dplac) insert. The same mutations that suppress PDS also suppress w(+) silencing from these P[lacW]ci(Dplac) derivative alleles. This indicates that both cis-acting changes in sequence and trans-acting P elements cause a similar change in chromatin structure that silences w(+) expression in P[lacW]ci(Dplac). Together, these results confirm that PDS occurs at P[lacW]ci(Dplac) because of the chromatin structure at this chromosomal position. Studying w(+) variegation from P[lacW]ci(Dplac) provides a model for the interactions that can enhance heterochromatic silencing at single P-element inserts.",2004,"Daniel Bushey, John Locke, Daniel Bushey, John Locke"
A conserved domain of alkaline phosphatase expression in the Malpighian tubules of dipteran insects,15326206,10.1242/jeb.01156,"Malpighian (renal) tubules are key components of the insect osmoregulatory system and show correspondingly great diversity in both number and length. Recently, the organisation of the Drosophila melanogaster tubule has been elucidated by enhancer trapping, and an array for functional properties has been shown to align with the functional domains. In Drosophila, there is a lower tubule domain, which coincides with expression of alkaline phosphatase and delineates the absorptive region of the tubule. Here, these observations are extended to three dipteran vectors of disease (Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensii and Glossina morsitans) and a non-dipteran out-group, Schistocerca gregaria (Orthoptera). Despite a huge range in cell number and size, alkaline phosphatase was found on the apical surface of the lower 10% of each of the dipteran tubules but nowhere within the orthopteran tubule. An alkaline phosphatase lower tubule domain is thus conserved among Diptera. Cell counts are also provided for each species. As in Drosophila, stellate cells are not found in the lower tubule domain of Anopheles or Aedes tubules, confirming the unique genetic identity of this domain. As previously reported, we failed to find stellate cells in Schistocerca but, remarkably, also failed to find them in Glossina, the dipteran most closely related to Drosophila. The orthodoxy that stellate cells are unique to, and general among, Diptera may thus require revision.",2004,"Pablo Cabrero, Valerie P Pollock, Shireen A Davies, Julian A T Dow, Pablo Cabrero, Valerie P Pollock, Shireen A Davies, Julian A T Dow"

The collection was generated in an isogenic strain, thus affording a uniform background for screens where sensitivity to genetic background is high. The entire collection, along with a computational and genetic toolbox for designing and generating custom deletions, is publicly available. Using the collection it is theoretically possible to generate >12,000 deletions between 1 bp and 1 Mb in size by simple eye color selection.

At warmer temperatures, when it is vitally important for the fly to avoid midday desiccation, more stringent regulation of splicing is observed, requiring the light input received through the visual system during the day and the circadian clock at night. During the course of this study, we observed that a mutation in the no-receptor-potential-A(P41) (norpA(P41)) gene, which encodes phospholipase-C, generated an extremely high level of 3' splicing.

Variability in immune competence was significantly associated with nucleotide polymorphism in 16 innate immunity genes, corresponding primarily to pathogen recognition and intracellular signaling loci, and substantial epistasis was detected between intracellular signaling and antimicrobial peptide genes.

Conservation of capa peptide-induced nitric oxide signalling in Diptera,15498959,10.1242/jeb.01255,"In D. melanogaster Malpighian (renal) tubules, the capa peptides stimulate production of nitric oxide (NO) and guanosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP), resulting in increased fluid transport. The roles of NO synthase (NOS), NO and cGMP in capa peptide signalling were tested in several other insect species of medical relevance within the Diptera (Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi and Glossina morsitans) and in one orthopteran out-group, Schistocerca gregaria. NOS immunoreactivity was detectable by immunocytochemistry in tubules from all species studied. D. melanogaster, A. aegypti and A. stephensi express NOS in only principal cells, whereas G. morsitans and S. gregaria show more general NOS expression in the tubule. Measurement of associated NOS activity (NADPH diaphorase) shows that both D. melanogaster capa-1 and the two capa peptides encoded in the A. gambiae genome, QGLVPFPRVamide (AngCAPA-QGL) and GPTVGLFAFPRVamide (AngCAPA-GPT), all stimulate NOS activity in D. melanogaster, A. aegypti, A. stephensi and G. morsitans tubules but not in S. gregaria. Furthermore, capa-stimulated NOS activity in all the Diptera was inhibited by the NOS inhibitor l-NAME. All capa peptides stimulate an increase in cGMP content across the dipteran species, but not in the orthopteran S. gregaria. Similarly, all capa peptides tested stimulate fluid secretion in D. melanogaster, A. aegypti, A. stephensi and G. morsitans tubules but are either without effect or are inhibitory on S. gregaria. Consistent with these results, the Drosophila capa receptor was shown to be expressed in Drosophila tubules, and its closest Anopheles homologue was shown to be expressed in Anopheles tubules. Thus, we provide the first demonstration of physiological roles for two putative A. gambiae neuropeptides. We also demonstrate neuropeptide modulation of fluid secretion in tsetse tubule for the first time.

Expression of functional human transferrin in stably transfected Drosophila S2 cells,15296447,10.1021/bp034375a,"Human transferrin (hTf) is a serum glycoprotein involved in Fe3+ transport. Here, a plasmid encoding the hTf gene fused with a hexahistidine (His6) epitope tag under Drosophila metallothionein promoter (pMT) was stably transfected into Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells as a nonlytic plasmid-based system. Following 3 days of copper sulfate induction, transfected S2 cells were found to secrete hTf into serum-free culture medium at a competitively high expression level of 40.8 microg/mL, producing 6.8 microg/mL/day in a 150-mL spinner flask culture. Purification of secreted recombinant hTf using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) yielded 95.5% pure recombinant hTf with a recovery of 32%. According to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis, purified S2 cell-derived His6-tagged recombinant hTf had a molecular weight (76.4 kDa) smaller than that of native apo-hTf (78.0 kDa). 2-Dimensional gel electrophoresis patterns showed recombinant hTf had a simpler and less acidic profile compared to that of native hTf. These data suggest recombinant hTf was incompletely (noncomplex) glycosylated and lacked sialic acids on N-glycans. However, this difference in N-glycan structure compared to native hTf had no effect on the iron-binding activity of recombinant hTf.

Plastic and evolved responses of larval tracheae and mass to varying atmospheric oxygen content in Drosophila melanogaster,15339952,10.1242/jeb.01189,"Structural changes in the tracheal system during development have the potential to allow insects to compensate for varying oxygen availability. Despite possible compensation, oxygen level during development may also affect insect body size. We investigated how atmospheric oxygen level affects the dimensions of the main dorsal tracheae (DT) and masses of larval Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) reared for up to six generations in 10%, 21% or 40% O2 at 25 degrees C. Wandering-stage third-instar larvae were weighed every other generation, and the dimensions of the DT were measured. Hypoxia produced significantly lighter larvae after one generation of exposure, while hyperoxia did not affect larval mass. Atmospheric oxygen content did not significantly change the diameters of the anterior portions of the main tracheae; however, the posterior diameters were strongly affected. During the first generation of exposure, tracheal diameters were inversely proportional to rearing oxygen levels, demonstrating that developmental plasticity in DT diameters can partially (8-15%) compensate for variation in atmospheric oxygen level. After multiple generations in differing atmospheres and two further generations in 21% O2, larvae had tracheal diameters inversely related to their historical oxygen exposure, suggesting that atmospheric oxygen can produce heritable changes in insect tracheal morphology.",2004,"Joanna R Henry, Jon F Harrison, Joanna R Henry, Jon F Harrison"

Here we document a recent evolutionary transition of a gene cluster from euchromatin to heterochromatin, which occurred <20 million years ago in the drosophilid lineage. This finding reveals evolutionary fluidity between these two genomic compartments and provides a powerful approach to identifying differences between euchromatic and heterochromatic genes. Promoter mapping of orthologous gene pairs led to the discovery of the ""slippery promoter,"" characterized by multiple transcriptional start sites predominantly at adenines, as a common promoter type found in both heterochromatic and euchromatic genes of Drosophila. Promoter type is diverse within the gene cluster but largely conserved between heterochromatic and euchromatic genes, eliminating the hypothesis that adaptation to heterochromatin required major alterations in promoter structure. Transition to heterochromatin is consistently associated with gene expansion due to the accumulation of transposable elements and increased A-T content. We conclude that heterochromatin-dependent regulation requires specialized enhancers or higher-order interactions and propose a facilitating role for transposable elements.",2005,"Jiro C Yasuhara, Christine H DeCrease, Barbara T Wakimoto, Jiro C Yasuhara, Christine H DeCrease, Barbara T Wakimoto"
Sap18 is required for the maternal gene bicoid to direct anterior patterning in Drosophila melanogaster,15649476,10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.11.011,"Development of the insect head is a complex process that in Drosophila requires the anterior determinant, Bicoid. Bicoid is present in an anterior-to-posterior concentration gradient, and binds DNA and stimulates transcription of head-specific genes. Many of these genes, including the gap-gene hunchback, are initially activated in a broad domain across the head primordium, but later retract so that their expression is cleared from the anterior-most segmented regions. Here, we show that retraction requires a Bicoid-interacting protein, Sap18, which is part of the Sin3/Rpd3 histone deacetylase complex. In sensitized-mutant backgrounds (e.g., bcdE1/+, removal of maternal sap18 results in embryos that are missing labrally derived parts of the cephalopharyngeal skeleton. These sap18 mutant embryos fail to repress hb expression, and show reduced anterior cap expression of the labral determinant cap 'n' collar. These phenotypes are enhanced by lowering the dose of rpd3, which encodes the catalytic subunit of the deacetylase complex. The results suggest a model where, in labral regions of the head, Bicoid is converted from an activator into a repressor by recruitment of a co-repressor to Bicoid-dependent promoters. Bicoid's activity, therefore, depends not only on its concentration gradient, but also on its interactions with modifier proteins within spatially restricted domains.",2005,"Navjot Singh, Wencheng Zhu, Steven D Hanes, Navjot Singh, Wencheng Zhu, Steven D Hanes"

Abnormal larvae display characteristic phenotype that involves the Malpighian tubules defect. Using interphase FISH method (fluorescence in situ hybridization), we showed that abnormal larvae had monosomy on chromosomes 2 and 3. DNA content in neuroblast interphase nuclei of abnormal larvae is 2.1 times less than in normal larvae. We suggest that abnormal larvae could be full or mosaic haploids that appeared as a result of maternal genome loss during fertilization or the mitotic division. Larvae with the same abnormalities appear in a progeny of females with different genotypes mating with males carrying compound chromosomes 2 or 3. FISH analysis showed that such larvae had monosomy only on a chromosome that is compound in paternal strain.

Evolutionary change in parasitoid resistance under crowded conditions in Drosophila melanogaster,16050105,,"Patterns of investment of limiting resources in such processes as competing for food and defense against natural enemies are shaped by trade-offs and constraints. In Drosophila melanogaster artificial selection for increased resistance to parasitoids results in a correlated decrease in larval competitive ability. Here we ask whether selection for competitive ability leads to a correlated reduction in parasitoid resistance. Replicated lines of D. melanogaster were maintained under crowded or uncrowded conditions for eight generations. As expected, the crowded lines evolved higher competitive ability (when tested against a common strain of fly). But instead of parasitoid resistance decreasing, we found a significant increase, and that this was associated with elevated densities of haemocytes in second-instar larvae. To understand these results we measured a variety of life-history traits in the two sets of lines. We find evidence that directly and indirectly selected changes in competitive ability are due to different mechanisms. We also ask why crowded conditions should select for increased resistance to parasitism, and conclude that it is unlikely to be due to correlated selection for resistance to other natural enemies, but might be due to correlated selection for better wound responses.",2005,"Amy E Sanders, Claire Scarborough, Sophie J Layen, Alex R Kraaijeveld, H Charles J Godfray, Amy E Sanders, Claire Scarborough, Sophie J Layen, Alex R Kraaijeveld, H Charles J Godfray"

Whereas many biochemical and cell culture studies suggest an involvement in the assembly of multiprotein complexes at cell contact sites, not much is known about their biological in vivo functions. We therefore set out to study the expression pattern and the effects of loss- and gain-of-function in the Drosophila melanogaster model system. We found that in flies these proteins are mainly expressed in axons at the root of fiber tracts, in places where strong fasciculation is required, e.g. at the neck of the peduncle of the mushroom bodies and in the optic chiasms. Despite their evolutionary conservation which implies fundamental and important functions, a P-element-induced null mutant (KG00210) of reggie1/flotillin2 (reggie1/flo2) in D. melanogaster shows no apparent phenotypic defects. This was even more surprising as we show that in this reggie1/flo2 null mutant the paralogous Reggie2/Flo1 protein is unstable and degraded, while the transcript is still present. The requirement of Reggie1/Flo2 for Reggie2/Flo1 stabilization is confirmed by misexpression experiments. Reggie2/Flo1 can only be misexpressed when Reggie1/Flo2 is provided as well. Conversely, Reggie1/Flo2 immunoreactivity can be detected, when its transgene is misexpressed alone. Using appropriate Gal4 driver lines, misexpression of Reggie1/Flo2 alone or together with Reggie2/Flo1 in the eye imaginal disc results in a specific and severe mislocalization of cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgCAMs) (while DE-Cadherin is unaffected) and in differentiation defects pointing to impaired signaling. In the wing imaginal disc, global overexpression of Reggie/Flotillin proteins leads to a significant extension of the Wingless signal and severely disrupts normal wing development.

They concluded that heterogeneity could not explain their results. We contend here that the statistical analysis was flawed. It was declared that there was no difference between the mortality plateaus of three different strains, on the basis of averaged outcomes. In fact, the results for the different strains were quite different. Most trials showed the expected lowering of the mortality plateaus for the flies selected for robustness, but these effects were washed out by a small number of very large opposing deviations. There is ample reason to believe that the opposing deviations are artifacts of fitting an overly restrictive hazard-rate model. When we fit more appropriate models, the evidence points toward a rejection of the null hypothesis (of identical plateaus), hence toward modest support for the heterogeneity explanation.",2005,"David Steinsaltz, David Steinsaltz"

Trans-splicing of the mod(mdg4) complex locus is conserved between the distantly related species Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis,15520256,10.1534/genetics.103.020842,"The modifier of mdg4, mod(mdg4), locus in Drosophila melanogaster represents a new type of complex gene in which functional diversity is resolved by mRNA trans-splicing. A protein family of >30 transcriptional regulators, which are supposed to be involved in higher-order chromatin structure, is encoded by both DNA strands of this locus. Mutations in mod(mdg4) have been identified independently in a number of genetic screens involving position-effect variegation, modulation of chromatin insulators, apoptosis, pathfinding of nerve cells, and chromosome pairing, indicating pleiotropic effects. The unusual gene structure and mRNA trans-splicing are evolutionary conserved in the distantly related species Drosophila virilis. Chimeric mod(mdg4) transcripts encoded from nonhomologous chromosomes containing the splice donor from D. virilis and the acceptor from D. melanogaster are produced in transgenic flies. We demonstrate that a significant amount of protein can be produced from these chimeric mRNAs.

This utmost sensitivity is critically dependent on the maintenance of an exceedingly low, dark, spontaneous activity of photoreceptor cells. However, the underlying mechanisms of this hallmark of phototransduction are not fully understood. An analysis of the Drosophila visual heterotrimeric (alphabetagamma) Gq protein revealed that wild-type Drosophila flies have about a twofold excess of Gbeta over Galpha subunits of the visual Gq protein. Studies of Gbetae mutants in which the excess of Gbeta was genetically eliminated showed dramatic dark, spontaneous activity of the photoreceptor cells, whereas concurrent genetic reduction of the Galpha subunit, which restored the excess of Gbeta, abolished this effect. These results indicate that an excess of Gbeta over Galpha is a strategy used in vivo for the suppression of spontaneous activity, thereby yielding a high signal to noise ratio, which is characteristic of the photoreceptor light response.

Superoxide dismutase evolution and life span regulation,15664623,10.1016/j.mad.2004.08.012,"Superoxide is among the most abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the mitochondria, and is involved in cellular signaling pathways. Superoxide and other ROS can damage cellular macromolecules and levels of oxidative damage products are positively correlated with aging. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes catalyze the breakdown of superoxide into hydrogen peroxide and water and are therefore central regulators of ROS levels. Genetic and transgenic manipulation of SOD activities in model systems such as S. cereviseae, mouse and Drosophila are consistent with a central role for SOD enzymes in regulating oxidative stress resistance. Over-expression of SOD in S. cereviseae and Drosophila can reduce oxidative damage and extend life span, but the mechanism(s) are not yet clear. A phylogenetic analysis of publicly available SOD protein sequences suggests several additional conserved gene families. For example, in addition to the well-characterized soluble Cu/Zn enzyme (Sod) and mitochondrial manganese-containing form (Sod2), Drosophila melanogaster is found to contain a putative copper chaperone (CCS), an extracellular Cu/Zn enzyme (Sod3), and an extracellular protein distantly related to the Cu/Zn forms (Sodq). C. elegans and blue crab are unusual in having two Mn-containing SODs, and A. gambiae contains an unusual internally repeated SOD. The most parsimonius conclusion from the analysis of the extracellular SODs is that they evolved independently multiple times by addition of a signal peptide to cytoplasmic SOD.",2005,"Gary N Landis, John Tower, Gary N Landis, John Tower"
Sequence polymorphism of candidate behavioural genes in Drosophila melanogaster flies from 'Evolution canyon',16101788,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02616.x,"This study focuses on the molecular features of three candidate behavioural genes in Drosophila melanogaster from the opposite slopes of Nahal Oren Canyon, Mount Carmel, Israel. These slopes display dramatic physical and biotic contrasts. Spatial variation of microclimatic conditions leads to adaptive differentiation and partial sexual isolation of populations, as suggested by our previous studies. The chosen candidate genes presumably contributing to genetic variation in sexual behaviour of Drosophila in the Canyon were desaturase, period, and no-on-transient A. These genes are known to include polymorphic repeated sequences, insertions/deletions, or nucleotide substitutions. The idea was that their polymorphism might be one of the determinants of behavioural peculiarities of flies derived from the opposite slopes. Indeed, interslope differences in the sequence encoding the (Thr-Gly)n repeat (exon 5) of the period gene were established, suggesting evolutionary functional importance. In particular, we unraveled variation in the length and composition of this region in different NFS (north-facing slope) and SFS (south-facing slope) lines. The 'European' allele (n = 20) was a 2.6-fold more abundant on the NFS compared to the SFS. This predominance probably gives some advantages for flies inhabiting wet and less warm conditions of the NFS. We suggest that repeat length/composition may influence the functional features of flies, i.e. habitat choice, nonrandom mating, and temperature adaptation. A series of female single-mate-choice tests show that females derived from NFS distinguish between males with specific per alleles (n = 17 vs. n = 20), as well as between males originated from the opposing slopes. Females from SFS were less discriminating and did not manifest significant deviation from random mating.",2005,"I Zamorzaeva, E Rashkovetsky, E Nevo, A Korol, I Zamorzaeva, E Rashkovetsky, E Nevo, A Korol"

Expression of wild-type and Arctic mutant (Glu22Gly) Abeta(1-42) peptides in Drosophila neural tissue results in intracellular Abeta accumulation followed by non-amyloid aggregates that resemble diffuse plaques. These histological changes are associated with progressive locomotor deficits and vacuolation of the brain and premature death of the flies. The severity of the neurodegeneration is proportional to the propensity of the expressed Abeta peptide to form oligomers. The fly phenotype is rescued by treatment with Congo Red that reduces Abeta aggregation in vitro.

Ada2a and Ada2b null homozygotes are late-larva and late-pupa lethal, respectively. Double mutants have a phenotype identical to that of the Ada2a mutant. The overproduction of ADA2a protein from transgenes cannot rescue the defects resulting from the loss of Ada2b, nor does complementation work vice versa, indicating that the two Ada2 genes of Drosophila have different functions. An analysis of germ line mosaics generated by pole-cell transplantation revealed that the Ada2a function (similar to that reported for Ada2b) is required in the female germ line. A loss of the function of either of the Ada2 genes interferes with cell proliferation. Interestingly, the Ada2b null mutation reduces histone H3 K14 and H3 K9 acetylation and changes TAF10 localization, while the Ada2a null mutation does not. Moreover, the two ADA2s are differently required for the expression of the rosy gene, involved in eye pigment production, and for Dmp53-mediated apoptosis.

For that purpose, transfection was used to introduce, in HeLa cells, a DNA sensing element that responds to chemical stress agents (heavy metals, genotoxic agents, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals). Such element was designed to direct the expression of a reporting gene (firefly luciferase) through the activation of Drosophila melanogaster hsp22 promoter. A molecular approach was conducted to optimize hsp22 promoter element in order to decrease the background expression level of the reporting gene and to increase the sensitivity of the bioassay for testing endocrine disruptors.

Phylogenetic and structural analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster p21-activated kinase DmPAK3,15777717,10.1016/j.gene.2004.12.030,"P21-activated kinases (PAKs) are a family of serine/threonine kinases whose diverse cellular functions in cytoskeletal reorganisation, cell motility, transformation and cell death are regulated both by the binding of the small RhoGTPases RAC and CDC42 and by RhoGTPase independent mechanisms. The genome of Drosophila melanogaster encodes three different PAK proteins: DmPAK1, DmMBT (DmPAK2) and DmPAK3. Although structurally related, DmPAK and DmMBT control different developmental processes and also differ in the regulation of their kinase activity through binding of RAC or CDC42. Here, we report the characterisation of DmPAK3. The phylogenetic analysis provides evidence that DmPAK3 and the related proteins from Drosophila pseudoobscura, Anopheles gambiae and Apis mellifera make up a distinct subgroup within the PAK protein family, which might be confined to insects. The structural differences of this PAK subgroup are also reflected by the selective binding of DmPAK3 to RAC-like RhoGTPases. Our biochemical analysis supports a model in which DmPAK3 can form homodimers where the N-terminal regulatory domain of one DmPAK3 protein can bind to and thereby inhibit the catalytic domain of the other DmPAK3 protein. Binding of activated RAC to the regulatory domain or mutation of the RAC-binding site in DmPAK3 relieves the inhibitory effect on kinase activity.

Compensatory cis-trans evolution and the dysregulation of gene expression in interspecific hybrids of Drosophila,16143608,10.1534/genetics.105.047449,"Hybrids between species are often characterized by novel gene-expression patterns. A recent study on allele-specific gene expression in hybrids between species of Drosophila revealed cases in which cis- and trans-regulatory elements within species had coevolved in such a way that changes in cis-regulatory elements are compensated by changes in trans-regulatory elements. We hypothesized that such coevolution should often lead to gene misexpression in the hybrid. To test this hypothesis, we estimated allele-specific expression and overall expression levels for 31 genes in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and their F1 hybrid. We found that 13 genes with cis-trans compensatory evolution are in fact misexpressed in the hybrid.

Furthermore, we crystallized the mutant enzyme in the presence of one of its substrates, thymidine, and the feedback inhibitor, dTTP. The introduction of the charged Asp residue appears to destabilize the LID region (residues 167-176) of the enzyme by electrostatic repulsion and no hydrogen bond to the 3'-OH is made in the substrate complex by Glu172 of the LID region.

"Positive selection of Iris, a retroviral envelope-derived host gene in Drosophila melanogaster",16244705,10.1371/journal.pgen.0010044,"Eukaryotic genomes can usurp enzymatic functions encoded by mobile elements for their own use. A particularly interesting kind of acquisition involves the domestication of retroviral envelope genes, which confer infectious membrane-fusion ability to retroviruses. So far, these examples have been limited to vertebrate genomes, including primates where the domesticated envelope is under purifying selection to assist placental function. Here, we show that in Drosophila genomes, a previously unannotated gene (CG4715, renamed Iris) was domesticated from a novel, active Kanga lineage of insect retroviruses at least 25 million years ago, and has since been maintained as a host gene that is expressed in all adult tissues. Iris and the envelope genes from Kanga retroviruses are homologous to those found in insect baculoviruses and gypsy and roo insect retroviruses. Two separate envelope domestications from the Kanga and roo retroviruses have taken place, in fruit fly and mosquito genomes, respectively. Whereas retroviral envelopes are proteolytically cleaved into the ligand-interaction and membrane-fusion domains, Iris appears to lack this cleavage site. In the takahashii/suzukii species groups of Drosophila, we find that Iris has tandemly duplicated to give rise to two genes (Iris-A and Iris-B). Iris-B has significantly diverged from the Iris-A lineage, primarily because of the ""invention"" of an intron de novo in what was previously exonic sequence. Unlike domesticated retroviral envelope genes in mammals, we find that Iris has been subject to strong positive selection between Drosophila species. The rapid, adaptive evolution of Iris is sufficient to unambiguously distinguish the phylogenies of three closely related sibling species of Drosophila (D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. mauritiana), a discriminative power previously described only for a putative ""speciation gene."" Iris represents the first instance of a retroviral envelope-derived host gene outside vertebrates. It is also the first example of a retroviral envelope gene that has been found to be subject to positive selection following its domestication. The unusual selective pressures acting on Iris suggest that it is an active participant in an ongoing genetic conflict. We propose a model in which Iris has ""switched sides,"" having been recruited by host genomes to combat baculoviruses and retroviruses, which employ homologous envelope genes to mediate infection.",2005,"Harmit S Malik, Steven Henikoff, Harmit S Malik, Steven Henikoff"
Aging of the innate immune response in Drosophila melanogaster,15771614,10.1111/j.1474-9728.2005.00147.x,"Increased activation of the innate immune system is a common feature of aging animals, including mammals and Drosophila melanogaster. With age, D. melanogaster progressively express higher levels of many antimicrobial peptides. It is unknown, however, whether this pattern reflects age-dependent changes in the function of the immune system itself or arises simply because aged adults have greater cumulative exposure to pathogens. Here we demonstrate that aged D. melanogaster transcribe more antimicrobial diptericin when experimentally exposed to septic bacterial infections. This strong net response in older females is the result of persistent diptericin transcription upon septic exposure, whereas young females rapidly terminate this induction. In contrast to their response to septic exposure, when exposed to killed bacteria aged females have less capacity to induce diptericin. Because this functional capacity of innate immunity declines with age, we conclude that female Drosophila undergo immune senescence. Furthermore, we show that fecundity is reduced by induction of innate immunity via the immune deficiency pathway. Consequently, maximum reproduction will occur when the immune response is tightly controlled in young females, even if this increases infection risk at later ages.",2005,"Melissa Zerofsky, Ephat Harel, Neal Silverman, Marc Tatar"

Although logistically difficult for large scale use, conventional animal models of IA provide valuable information regarding both antifungal drug efficacy and Aspergillus mutant virulence. However, in the era of introduction of molecular biology techniques for studying Aspergillus and increasing antifungal options, the existing in vivo models of IA might be well complemented by nonvertebrate minihost models such as the Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly).

Effective translation of the second cistron in two Drosophila dicistronic transcripts is determined by the absence of in-frame AUG codons in the first cistron,15951443,10.1074/jbc.M500255200,"The novel dicistronic transcript encoded by the Drosophila melanogaster stoned gene was recognized as being unusual in that the protein encoded by the first open reading frame, stoned-A (STNA), contains no internal methionine residues in a protein of 93 kDa. The dicistronic nature of the stoned locus and the lack of methionine residues in STNA is conserved across dipteran species. A second methionine-free cistron, encoding Snapin, was identified in Drosophila and also found to be dicistronic, the second open reading frame (ORF) encoding a methyltransferase. We have replaced the methyltransferase cistron with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and used this dicistronic construct to show that the GFP cistron is translated in Drosophila S2 cells. The insertion of in-frame AUG codons into the snapin ORF attenuates the translation of GFP, and the level of attenuation correlates with the number of inserted AUGs. Increasing the efficiency of translation-initiation of the Snapin cistron also attenuates the translation of GFP. This indicates that failure to initiate translation at the first AUG allows ribosomes to scan through the Snapin ORF and to initiate translation of the second cistron, unless new AUG codons are inserted. These data are used to interpret the expression of the stoned locus and in particular, to explain the altered stoned protein levels in the stoned-temperature-sensitive mutant allele, which replaces a lysine with a methionine codon early in the first, stonedA, cistron.",2005,"Adam A Wall, A Marie Phillips, Leonard E Kelly, Adam A Wall, A Marie Phillips, Leonard E Kelly"

H functions as antagonist in the Notch-signaling pathway in Drosophila, and the link to growth and apoptosis is poorly understood. To further our insight into H-mediated apoptosis, we performed two large-scale screens for modifiers of a small rough eye phenotype caused by H overexpression. Both loss- and gain-of-function screens revealed known and new genetic interactors representing diverse cellular functions. Many of them did not cause eye phenotypes on their own, emphasizing a specific genetic interaction with H. As expected, we also identified components of different signaling pathways supposed to be involved in the regulation of cell growth and cell death. Accordingly, some of them also acted as modifiers of proapoptotic genes, suggesting a more general involvement in the regulation of apoptosis. Overall, these screens highlight the importance of H and the Notch pathway in mediating cell death in response to developmental and environmental cues and emphasize their role in maintaining developmental cellular homeostasis.",2005,"Dominik MÃ¼ller, Sabrina J Kugler, Anette Preiss, Dieter Maier, Anja C Nagel, Dominik MÃ¼ller, Sabrina J Kugler, Anette Preiss, Dieter Maier, Anja C Nagel"
Assortative mating in Drosophila adapted to a microsite ecological gradient,16273320,10.1007/s10519-005-6119-2,"Elucidating the causes of population divergence, and ultimately speciation, is a central objective of evolutionary biology.

Peculiarities in courtship song patterns and nonrandom mating were observed, despite a small interslope distance. Single and multiple mate choice tests with D. melanogaster from the opposite slopes displayed highly significant assortative mating, with preference for sexual partners from the same slope. Here we report the results on mate choice in the sibling species D. melanogaster and D. simulans inhabiting Nahal Oren canyon. Significant assortative mating was found in both species.

Sexy sons from re-mating do not recoup the direct costs of harmful male interactions in the Drosophila melanogaster laboratory model system,16135126,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2005.00923.x,"The empirical foundation for sexual conflict theory is the data from many different taxa demonstrating that females are harmed while interacting with males. However, the interpretation of this keystone evidence has been challenged because females may more than counterbalance the direct costs of interacting with males by the indirect benefits of obtaining higher quality genes for their offspring. A quantification of this trade-off is critical to resolve the controversy and is presented here. A multi-generation fitness assay in the Drosophila melanogaster laboratory model system was used to quantify both the direct costs to females due to interactions with males and indirect benefits via sexy sons. We specifically focus on the interactions that occur between males and nonvirgin females. In the laboratory environment of our base population, females mate soon after eclosion and store sufficient sperm for their entire lifetime, yet males persistently court these nonvirgin females and frequently succeed in re-mating them. Females may benefit from these interactions despite direct costs to their lifetime fecundity if re-mating allows them to trade-up to mates of higher genetic quality and thereby secure indirect benefits for their offspring. We found that direct costs of interactions between males and nonvirgin females substantially exceeded indirect benefits through sexy sons. These data, in combination with past studies of the good genes route of indirect benefits, demonstrate that inter-sexual interactions drive sexually antagonistic co-evolution in this model system.",2005,"N Orteiza, J E Linder, W R Rice, N Orteiza, J E Linder, W R Rice"

Drosophila CLASP is required for the incorporation of microtubule subunits into fluxing kinetochore fibres,15592460,10.1038/ncb1207,"The motion of a chromosome during mitosis is mediated by a bundle of microtubules, termed a kinetochore fibre (K-fibre), which connects the kinetochore of the chromosome to a spindle pole. Once formed, mature K-fibres maintain a steady state length because the continuous addition of microtubule subunits onto microtubule plus ends at the kinetochore is balanced by their removal at their minus ends within the pole. This condition is known as 'microtubule poleward flux'. Chromosome motion and changes in position are then driven by changes in K-fibre length, which in turn are controlled by changes in the rates at which microtubule subunits are added at the kinetochore and/or removed from the pole. A key to understanding the role of flux in mitosis is to identify the molecular factors that drive it. Here we use Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells expressing alpha-tubulin tagged with green fluorescent protein, RNA interference, laser microsurgery and photobleaching to show that the kinetochore protein MAST/Orbit - the single CLASP orthologue in Drosophila - is an essential component for microtubule subunit incorporation into fluxing K-fibres.",2005,"Helder Maiato, Alexey Khodjakov, Conly L Rieder, Helder Maiato, Alexey Khodjakov, Conly L Rieder"
I element distribution in mitotic heterochromatin of Drosophila melanogaster reactive strains: identification of a specific site which is correlated with the reactivity levels,16093668,10.1159/000084948,"The I factor is a Drosophila melanogaster LINE-like element that efficiently transposes in the genetic system of I-R hybrid dysgenesis.

In this work we have performed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping of I element sequences in mitotic heterochromatin of nine differentially reactive D. melanogaster strains. The results of our analysis showed that a single hybridization site mapping to region h28 of the distal heterochromatin of the X chromosome is present in three strains with low or intermediate levels of reactivity, while it is undetectable in six highly reactive strains. Together, these observations suggest a negative correlation between I sequences located at h28 and the level of reactivity. To this regard, it is intriguing that flamenco and COM, two loci that regulate the activity of D. melanogaster endogenous retroviruses also map to the distal heterochromatin of the X chromosome. Our data represent the first experimental evidence in favour of a silencing effect exerted by naturally occurring I element sequences located in pericentromeric heterochromatin.",2005,"P Dimitri, A Bucheton"
Genetic variation for total fitness in Drosophila melanogaster: complex yet replicable patterns,15545656,10.1534/genetics.104.032367,"The extent of genetic variation in fitness is a crucial issue in evolutionary biology and yet remains largely unresolved. In Drosophila melanogaster, we have devised a method that allows the net effects on fitness of heterozygous wild-type chromosomes to be measured, by competing them against two different ""balancer"" chromosomes. We have applied the method to a large sample of 40 wild-type third chromosomes and have measured fitnesses of nonlethal chromosomes as well as chromosomes bearing recessive lethals. The measurements were made in the environment to which the population was adapted and did not involve inbreeding. The results show an extraordinary similarity in the behavior of replicates of the same chromosome, indicating consistent genetic effects on total fitness. Some invading chromosomes increased rapidly and some slowly, and some rose to appreciable frequency after several months, but then declined again: in every case, the same pattern was seen in each replicate. We estimated relative fitnesses, rates of change of fitness, and relative viabilities, for each chromosome. There were significant fluctuations around the fitted model, which were also highly replicable. Wild-type chromosomes varied substantially in their effects on heterozygous fitness, and these effects vary through time, most likely as a result of genotype x environment interactions.",2005,"Michael P Gardner, Kevin Fowler, Nicholas H Barton, Linda Partridge, Michael P Gardner, Kevin Fowler, Nicholas H Barton, Linda Partridge"

The effect of engineered disulfide bonds on the stability of Drosophila melanogaster acetylcholinesterase,16686937,10.1186/1471-2091-7-12,"Background:
      
    

    
      Acetylcholinesterase is irreversibly inhibited by organophosphate and carbamate insecticides allowing its use in biosensors for detection of these insecticides. Drosophila acetylcholinesterase is the most sensitive enzyme known and has been improved by in vitro mutagenesis. However, its stability has to be improved for extensive utilization.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      To create a disulfide bond that could increase the stability of the Drosophila melanogaster acetylcholinesterase, we selected seven positions taking into account first the distance between Cbeta of two residues, in which newly introduced cysteines will form the new disulfide bond and second the conservation of the residues in the cholinesterase family. Most disulfide bonds tested did not increase and even decreased the stability of the protein. However, one engineered disulfide bridge, I327C/D375C showed significant stability increase toward denaturation by temperature (170 fold at 50 degrees C), urea, organic solvent and provided resistance to protease degradation. The new disulfide bridge links the N-terminal domain (first 356 aa) to the C-terminal domain. The quantities produced by this mutant were the same as in wild-type flies.

Fitness effects and transmission routes of a microsporidian parasite infecting Drosophila and its parasitoids,16318674,10.1017/S0031182005009339,"A microsporidian infection was discovered in laboratory cultures of Drosophila species. Ultrastructural examination suggested it belonged to the poorly characterized species Tubulinosema kingi, and morphological and sequence data are presented. We explored how T. kingi affected the fitness of Drosophila melanogaster and D. subobscura, as well as the fitness of 2 of their parasitoids, Asobara tabida and Pachycrepoideus vindemiae. In Drosophila, infections caused changes in most of the traits we looked at that were associated with fitness, in particular causing a 34-55% reduction in early-life fecundity. Parasitoid fitness was affected more severely by infection than that of their hosts, with pupal mortality in particular increasing by 75-89%. We investigated the most important routes of transmission for T. kingi in a laboratory setting. Letting Drosophila larvae feed on medium contaminated with spores from infected dead flies resulted in 100% infection. Low levels of transmission (<10%) were found between larvae, and vertically between mothers and their offspring. Parasitoids developing in infected hosts all became infected, but infected adults were neither able to transmit the pathogen to their offspring nor to their offspring's Drosophila host, either directly, or via contamination of the ovipositor or other body parts.

Functional analysis of circadian pacemaker neurons in Drosophila melanogaster,16510731,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1234-05.2006,"The molecular mechanisms of circadian rhythms are well known, but how multiple clocks within one organism generate a structured rhythmic output remains a mystery. Many animals show bimodal activity rhythms with morning (M) and evening (E) activity bouts. One long-standing model assumes that two mutually coupled oscillators underlie these bouts and show different sensitivities to light. Three groups of lateral neurons (LN) and three groups of dorsal neurons govern behavioral rhythmicity of Drosophila. Recent data suggest that two groups of the LN (the ventral subset of the small LN cells and the dorsal subset of LN cells) are plausible candidates for the M and E oscillator, respectively. We provide evidence that these neuronal groups respond differently to light and can be completely desynchronized from one another by constant light, leading to two activity components that free-run with different periods. As expected, a long-period component started from the E activity bout. However, a short-period component originated not exclusively from the morning peak but more prominently from the evening peak. This reveals an interesting deviation from the original Pittendrigh and Daan (1976) model and suggests that a subgroup of the ventral subset of the small LN acts as ""main"" oscillator controlling M and E activity bouts in Drosophila.",2006,"Dirk Rieger, Orie Thomas Shafer, Kenji Tomioka, Charlotte Helfrich-FÃ¶rster, Dirk Rieger, Orie Thomas Shafer, Kenji Tomioka, Charlotte Helfrich-FÃ¶rster"

A genetic suppressor of two dominant temperature-sensitive lethal proteasome mutants of Drosophila melanogaster is itself a mutated proteasome subunit gene,16648584,10.1534/genetics.106.057976,"Two dominant temperature-sensitive (DTS) lethal mutants of Drosophila melanogaster are Pros26(1) and Prosbeta2(1), previously known as DTS5 and DTS7. Heterozygotes for either mutant die as pupae when raised at 29 degrees , but are normally viable and fertile at 25 degrees . Previous studies have identified these as missense mutations in the genes encoding the beta6 and beta2 subunits of the 20S proteasome, respectively. In an effort to isolate additional proteasome-related mutants a screen for dominant suppressors of Pros26(1) was carried out, resulting in the identification of Pros25(SuDTS) [originally called Su(DTS)], a missense mutation in the gene encoding the 20S proteasome alpha2 subunit. Pros25(SuDTS) acts in a dominant manner to rescue both Pros26(1) and Prosbeta2(1) from their DTS lethal phenotypes. Using an in vivo protein degradation assay it was shown that this suppression occurs by counteracting the dominant-negative effect of the DTS mutant on proteasome activity. Pros25(SuDTS) is a recessive polyphasic lethal at ambient temperatures. The effects of these mutants on larval neuroblast mitosis were also examined. While Prosbeta2(1) shows a modest increase in the number of defective mitotic figures, there were no defects seen with the other two mutants, other than slightly reduced mitotic indexes.",2006,"Peter J Neuburger, Kenneth J Saville, Jue Zeng, Kerrie-Ann Smyth, John M Belote, Peter J Neuburger, Kenneth J Saville, Jue Zeng, Kerrie-Ann Smyth, John M Belote"

While European and American D. melanogaster populations showed very low differentiation, Asian D. melanogaster populations were highly structured.

Variation in synonymous codon use and DNA polymorphism within the Drosophila genome,16405571,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2005.00996.x,"A strong negative correlation between the rate of amino-acid substitution and codon usage bias in Drosophila has been attributed to interference between positive selection at nonsynonymous sites and weak selection on codon usage. To further explore this possibility we have investigated polymorphism and divergence at three kinds of sites: synonymous, nonsynonymous and intronic in relation to codon bias in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. We confirmed that protein evolution is one of the main explicative parameters for interlocus codon bias variation (r(2) approximately 40%). However, intron or synonymous diversities, which could have been expected to be good indicators of local interference [here defined as the additional increase of drift due to selection on tightly linked sites, also called 'genetic draft' by Gillespie (2000)] did not covary significantly with codon bias or with protein evolution. Concurrently, levels of polymorphism were reduced in regions of low recombination rates whereas codon bias was not. Finally, while nonsynonymous diversities were very well correlated between species, neither synonymous nor intron diversities observed in D. melanogaster were correlated with those observed in D. simulans. All together, our results suggest that the selective constraint on the protein is a stable component of gene evolution while local interference is not. The pattern of variation in genetic draft along the genome therefore seems to be instable through evolutionary times and should therefore be considered as a minor determinant of codon bias variance. We argue that selective constraints for optimal codon usage are likely to be correlated with selective constraints on the protein, both between codons within a gene, as previously suggested, and also between genes within a genome.",2006,"N Bierne, A Eyre-Walker, N Bierne, A Eyre-Walker"
Drosophila diet restriction in practice: do flies consume fewer nutrients?,16256171,10.1016/j.mad.2005.09.004,"Although many studies of Drosophila melanogaster report an effect of diet upon lifespan, it is assumed rather than know that adults maintained on restricted diet acquire fewer nutrients. Diet is restricted in practice by feeding flies a medium where nutrients are diluted and some early reports suggest that flies on diluted medium compensate with increased food intake to consume equal calories on all diets. Here we measure the feeding rate of adult Drosophila upon a yeast-restricted diet that increases survival and reduces fecundity. We directly assessed food intake from the volume of consumed dye-marked medium and from the quantity of marked fecal pellets. Females were longest lived on diet with intermediate yeast concentration but food intake was greatest on diet with abundant yeast. Rather than compensatory feeding upon diluted diet, females increased food intake on the diet with elevated nutrient concentration. Consequently, females on diluted yeast-limited media will consume fewer calories as well as less yeast. To understand the importance of specific nutrients relative to calories as mediators of Drosophila aging, we must directly measure food intake and control for the feeding stimulation of nutrients.",2006,"Kyung-Jin Min, Marc Tatar, Kyung-Jin Min, Marc Tatar"
Dendritic patterning by Dscam and synaptic partner matching in the Drosophila antennal lobe,16474389,10.1038/nn1652,"In the olfactory system of Drosophila melanogaster, axons of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and dendrites of second-order projection neurons typically target 1 of approximately 50 glomeruli. Dscam, an immunoglobulin superfamily protein, acts in ORNs to regulate axon targeting. Here we show that Dscam acts in projection neurons and local interneurons to control the elaboration of dendritic fields. The removal of Dscam selectively from projection neurons or local interneurons led to clumped dendrites and marked reduction in their dendritic field size. Overexpression of Dscam in projection neurons caused dendrites to be more diffuse during development and shifted their relative position in adulthood. Notably, the positional shift of projection neuron dendrites caused a corresponding shift of its partner ORN axons, thus maintaining the connection specificity. This observation provides evidence for a pre- and postsynaptic matching mechanism independent of precise glomerular positioning.",2006,"Haitao Zhu, Thomas Hummel, James C Clemens, Daniela Berdnik, S Lawrence Zipursky, Liqun Luo, Haitao Zhu, Thomas Hummel, James C Clemens, Daniela Berdnik, S Lawrence Zipursky, Liqun Luo"

It is shown, that life expectancy of ecdysone-deficient woc strain exceeds life expectancy of wild type Canton-S strain by 46%, whereas ecdysone or metaverone treatment removes these distinctions. At the same time, treatment by ecdysteroid-containing preparations of Canton-S has not induced any essential alteration of life span. Thus, the new ageing gene woc has been discovered, the woc mutation essentially increases the life span of Drosophila, and its effect is mediated by a hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone and has the threshold corresponding natural physiological concentration of this hormone in an insect organism. The data have confirmed the conception of ""antagonistic pleiotropy"" according to which only mutations having advantages during the prereproductive and reproductive period are fixed in evolution, and their negative effect is delayed up to a postreproductive stage of life cycle. As a result we can see accumulation with age of structural and functional damages which increase probability of death.

Soma-germline interactions coordinate homeostasis and growth in the Drosophila gonad,16936717,10.1038/nature05068,"The ability of organs such as the liver or the lymphoid system to maintain their original size or regain it after injury is well documented. However, little is known about how these organs sense that equilibrium is breached, and how they cease changing when homeostasis is reached. Similarly, it remains unclear how, during normal development, different cell types within an organ coordinate their growth. Here we show that during gonad development in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster the proliferation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) and survival of the somatic intermingled cells (ICs) that contact them are coordinated by means of a feedback mechanism composed of a positive signal and a negative signal. PGCs express the EGF receptor (EGFR) ligand Spitz, which is required for IC survival. In turn, ICs inhibit PGC proliferation. Thus, homeostasis and coordination of growth between soma and germ line in the larval ovary is achieved by using a sensor of PGC numbers (EGFR-mediated survival of ICs) coupled to a correction mechanism inhibiting PGC proliferation. This feedback loop ensures that sufficient numbers of PGCs exist to fill all the stem-cell niches that form at the end of larval development. We propose that similar feedback mechanisms might be generally used for coordinated growth, regeneration and homeostasis.",2006,"Lilach Gilboa, Ruth Lehmann, Lilach Gilboa, Ruth Lehmann"
Sex-specific regulation of aging and apoptosis,16764907,10.1016/j.mad.2006.05.001,"Genetic analysis of Drosophila, mice and humans indicates that gene alleles, mutations and transgenes that affect life span tend to do so differently depending on the sex of the organism. The likely reason for this is that the sexes are different genotypes (e.g., X/X vs. X/Y) and face quite different environments: e.g., to reproduce, males have to mate with females while females have to mate with males. Genes are subject to different genetic interactions and different gene-by-environment effects in male vs. female. The consequence is that through evolution certain genes are differently selected and optimized for each sex. Both the mitochondrial genome and the X chromosome are asymmetrically inherited in Drosophila and mammals; through evolution these genes spend relatively more time under selection in females and are therefore expected to be better optimized for function in the female than in the male. Consistent with this the Drosophila X chromosome has been found to be a hotspot for sexually antagonistic fitness variation. Old Drosophila and old mammals exhibit apoptosis-an observation consistent with the idea that the mitochondria are less functional during aging due to maternal-only inheritance. One feature of aging that is common to Drosophila and mammals is that females tend to live longer than males, and this may be due in part to sub-optimal mitochondrial function in males. The data support the conclusion that a significant part of the aging phenotype is due to antagonistic pleiotropy of gene function between the sexes. Liberal application of Occam's razor yields a molecular model for the co-regulation of sex, apoptosis and life span based on the on/off status of a single gene: Sxl in Drosophila melanogaster and Xist in humans. Aging may simply represent an ancient and conserved mechanism by which genes re-assort.",2006,"John Tower, John Tower"
Rac1 signalling in the Drosophila larval cellular immune response,16621891,10.1242/jcs.02920,"The Drosophila larval cellular immune response involves cells (hemocytes) that can be recruited from a hematopoietic organ located behind the brain, as well as a sessile population of cells found just underneath the larval cuticle arranged in a segmental pattern. By using two Rac1 GTPase effector-loop mutants together with epistasis studies, we show that Rac1 requires the Drosophila melanogaster Jun N-terminal kinase Basket (Bsk), as well as stable actin formation to recruit the sessile hemocyte population. We show that actin stabilization is necessary for Rac1-induced hemocyte activation by lowering cofilin (encoded by the twinstar gene tsr) expression in blood cells. Removing Bsk by RNAi suppressed Rac1-induced release of sessile hemocytes. RNAi against Bsk also suppressed Rac1 induction of lamellocytes, a specialized population of hemocytes necessary for the encapsulation of invading pathogens. Furthermore, Rac1 and Bsk are involved in regulating the formation of actin- and focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-rich placodes in hemocytes. Lastly, Rac1 and Bsk are both required for the proper encapsulation of eggs from the parasitoid wasp Leptipolina boulardi. From these data we conclude that Rac1 induces Bsk activity and stable actin formation for cellular immune activation, leading to sessile hemocyte release and an increase in the number of circulating hemocytes.",2006,"Michael J Williams, Magda-Lena Wiklund, Shandy Wikman, Dan Hultmark, Michael J Williams, Magda-Lena Wiklund, Shandy Wikman, Dan Hultmark"

In a previous study, we have identified and characterized a cDNA encoding a novel putative extracellular matrix protein named tenebrin, in the beetle Tenebrio molitor. Here, we examine the expression of the Drosophila ortholog, referred to as Tenectin (Tnc), during embryonic development. Tnc is expressed in the majority of tissues of neuroectodermic origin such as hindgut, foregut, tracheal system, anal plate, and CNS. In the CNS, the Tnc transcript is restricted to a few cells, whereas the protein is located in the dorsal part of the axonal tracts. In the hindgut and the trachea, Tnc protein is expressed on the apical pole of the cells. Tnc is an extracellular matrix protein secreted in a polarized way in different organs of Drosophila embryos.",2006,"StÃ©phane Fraichard, Anne-Laure Bouge, Isabelle Chauvel, HervÃ© Bouhin, StÃ©phane Fraichard, Anne-Laure Bouge, Isabelle Chauvel, HervÃ© Bouhin"
"Isolation and characterization of cDNA encoding Argonaute, a component of RNA silencing in shrimp (Penaeus monodon)",16938476,10.1016/j.cbpb.2006.07.002,"We have identified a cDNA clone that encodes a protein with high sequence homology to Argonaute proteins of mammals and Drosophila melanogaster. The cDNA of Penaeus monodon (Pm Ago) consisted of 3178 nucleotides encoding 939-amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 104 kDa. The primary structure of Pm Ago showed the presence of two signature domains, PAZ and PIWI domains that exhibit highest homology to their counterparts in D. melanogaster. The inferred protein sequence of Pm Ago was 80.8% identical with D. melanogaster and 82.1% identical with Anopheles gambiae Ago proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of Pm Ago with other invertebrate and vertebrate Argonaute proteins suggested that Pm Ago belongs to the Ago1 subfamily that plays crucial roles in stem cell differentiation or RNA interference (RNAi). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the gene is highly expressed in the lymphoid organ and moderately expressed in intestine, muscle, pleopods and hemocytes. The expression of Pm Ago1 mRNA was 2-3-fold increased during the early period of viral infection but declined rapidly at 30 hour post infection. By contrast, infection of shrimp by a bacterial pathogen, Vibrio harveyi did not induce a reduction of Pm Ago1 mRNA suggesting that its expression is associated with virus infection.",2006,"Sasimanas Unajak, Vichai Boonsaeng, Sarawut Jitrapakdee, Sasimanas Unajak, Vichai Boonsaeng, Sarawut Jitrapakdee"
Expression and characterization of recombinant tyramine beta-monooxygenase from Drosophila: a monomeric copper-containing hydroxylase,16376104,10.1016/j.pep.2005.11.008,"We report here the development of a robust recombinant expression system for Drosophila melanogaster tyramine beta-monooxygenase (TbetaM), the insect analog of mammalian dopamine beta-monooxygenase. Recombinant TbetaM is rapidly purified from the host cell media in three chromatographic steps. The expression system produces approximately 3-10 mg of highly purified, active protein per liter of culture. Recombinant TbetaM requires copper for activity and has a typical type 2 copper EPR spectrum. While TbetaM efficiently hydroxylates the aliphatic carbon of phenolic amines such as tyramine (the physiological substrate) and dopamine, phenethylamine is a poor substrate. TbetaM is most likely a monomer under physiological conditions, although under conditions of high pH and low ionic strength the dimeric form predominates.

Recognition and unfolding of target proteins involves the regulatory cap whose base contains six AAA-ATPases that display reverse chaperone activity. One of them, Rpt2 (also known as S4), has an essential role in gating the degradative central core. We have isolated the orthologous gene Pros26.4 from Drosophila melanogaster as a molecular interaction partner of Hairless. Hairless plays a major role as antagonist of Notch signalling in Drosophila, prompting our interest in the Hairless-Pros26.4 interaction. We find that Pros26.4 negatively regulates Hairless at the genetic and molecular level. Depletion of Pros26.4 by using tissue-specific RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in a specific stabilization of the Hairless protein, but not in stabilization of the intracellular domain of Notch or the effector protein Suppressor of Hairless.

Molecular elucidation of ""speciation genes"" advanced recently, yet it remains without clear identification of the gene complexes participating in reproductive isolation between natural populations, particularly, in sympatry. Genetic divergence was discovered between Drosophila melanogaster populations inhabiting ecologically contrasting, opposite slopes in ""Evolution Canyon"" (EC), Mt. Carmel, Israel. Interslope migration of flies is easy and verified. Nevertheless, significant interslope D. melanogaster population divergence was established at EC involving habitat choice, mate choice, thermal and drought tolerances, adaptive genes, and mobile elements. Parallel patterns of stress tolerance, habitat choice, and mate choice were demonstrated in Drosophila simulans at EC, although on a smaller scale. However, some tests for interslope genetic differentiation in Drosophila, derived from the opposite EC slopes, gave somewhat controversial results. Here we present new empirical data on interslope genetic divergence of Drosophila at EC, and summarize previous supporting and controversial results. We suggest that Drosophila populations at EC represent a rare example, demonstrating how selection overrides migration, and propose an ad hoc ecological model of incipient sympatric divergence.",2006,"Abraham Korol, Eugenia Rashkovetsky, Konstantin Iliadi, Eviatar Nevo, Abraham Korol, Eugenia Rashkovetsky, Konstantin Iliadi, Eviatar Nevo"

Nuclease-resistant molecular beacons are designed to efficiently hybridize to accessible regions within RNAs and then be detected via fluorescence microscopy. The target regions chosen for probe binding are selected using two computer algorithms, mfold and OligoWalk, that predict the secondary structure of RNAs and help narrow down sequence stretches to which the probes should bind with high affinity in vivo.

To better understand the evolution of this gene superfamily, I compared all Cys-loop LGICs from rat, the primitive chordate Ciona intestinalis, Drosophila, and C. elegans. There are two clades of GABA receptor subunits that include both vertebrate and invertebrate orthologues. In addition, I identified nine clades of anion channel subunits found only in invertebrates, including three that are specific to C. elegans and two found only in Drosophila. One well-defined clade of vertebrate cation channel subunits, the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits (nAChR), includes invertebrate orthologues. There are two clades of invertebrate nAChRs, one of alpha-type subunits and one of non-alpha subunits, that are most similar to the two clades of vertebrate neuronal and muscle alpha and non-alpha subunits. There is a large group of divergent C. elegans nAChR-like subunits partially resolved into clades but no orthologues of 5HT3-type serotonin receptors in the invertebrates. The topology of the trees suggests that most of the invertebrate-specific Cys-loop LGIC clades were present in the common ancestor of chordates and ecdysozoa. Many of these disappeared from the chordates. Subsequently, selected subunit genes expanded to form large subfamilies.",2006,"Joseph A Dent, Joseph A Dent"
Positive and negative selection in the beta-esterase gene cluster of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup,16547641,10.1007/s00239-005-0140-1,"We examine the pattern of molecular evolution of the beta-esterase gene cluster, including the Est-6 and psiEst-6 genes, in eight species of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. Using maximum likelihood estimates of nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratios, we show that the majority of Est-6 sites evolves under strong (48% of sites) or moderate (50% of sites) negative selection and a minority of sites (1.5%) is under significant positive selection. Est-6 sites likely to be under positive selection are associated with increased intraspecific variability. One positively selected site is responsible for the EST-6 F/S allozyme polymorphism; the same site is responsible for the EST-6 functional divergence between species of the melanogaster subgroup. For psiEst-6 83.7% sites evolve under negative selection, 16% sites evolve neutrally, and 0.3% sites are under positive selection. The positively selected sites of psiEst-6 are located at the beginning and at the end of the gene, where there is reduced divergence between D. melanogaster and D. simulans; these regions of psiEst-6 could be involved in regulation or some other function. Branch-site-specific analysis shows that the evolution of the melanogaster subgroup underwent episodic positive selection. Collating the present data with previous results for the beta-esterase genes, we propose that positive and negative selection are involved in a complex relationship that may be typical of the divergence of duplicate genes as one or both duplicates evolve a new function.",2006,"Evgeniy S Balakirev, Maria Anisimova, Francisco J Ayala, Evgeniy S Balakirev, Maria Anisimova, Francisco J Ayala"
A Drosophila nonvisual arrestin is required for the maintenance of olfactory sensitivity,16306316,10.1093/chemse/bjj005,"Nonvisual arrestins are a family of multifunctional adaptor molecules that regulate the activities of diverse families of receptors including G protein-coupled receptors, frizzled, and transforming growth factor-beta receptors. These activities indicate broad roles in both physiology and development for nonvisual arrestins. Drosophila melanogaster has a single nonvisual arrestin, kurtz, which is found at high levels within the adult olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), suggesting a role for this gene in modulating olfactory sensitivity. Using heat-induced expression of a krz cDNA through development, we rescued krz(1) lethality. The resulting adults lacked detectable levels of krz in the olfactory system. The rescued krz(1) homozygotes have an incompletely penetrant antennal structural defect that was completely rescued by the neural expression of a krz cDNA. The krz(1) loss-of-function adults without visible antennal defects displayed diminished behavioral responsiveness to both aversive and attractive odors and also demonstrated reduced olfactory receptor potentials. Both the behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes were rescued by the targeted expression of the krz cDNA within postdevelopmental ORNs. Thus, krz is required within the nervous system for antennal development and is required later in the ORNs for the maintenance of olfactory sensitivity in Drosophila. The reduced receptor potentials in krz(1) antenna indicate that nonvisual arrestins are required for the early odor-induced signaling events within the ORNs.",2006,"Hong Ge, Parthasarathy Krishnan, Lingzhi Liu, Balaji Krishnan, Ronald L Davis, Paul E Hardin, Gregg Roman, Hong Ge, Parthasarathy Krishnan, Lingzhi Liu, Balaji Krishnan, Ronald L Davis, Paul E Hardin, Gregg Roman"
Genomic organization of the Drosophila telomere retrotransposable elements,16963706,10.1101/gr.5348806,"The emerging sequence of the heterochromatic portion of the Drosophila melanogaster genome, with the most recent update of euchromatic sequence, gives the first genome-wide view of the chromosomal distribution of the telomeric retrotransposons, HeT-A, TART, and Tahre. As expected, these elements are entirely excluded from euchromatin, although sequence fragments of HeT-A and TART 3 untranslated regions are found in nontelomeric heterochromatin on the Y chromosome. The proximal ends of HeT-A/TART arrays appear to be a transition zone because only here do other transposable elements mix in the array. The sharp distinction between the distribution of telomeric elements and that of other transposable elements suggests that chromatin structure is important in telomere element localization. Measurements reported here show (1) D. melanogaster telomeres are very long, in the size range reported for inbred mouse strains (averaging 46 kb per chromosome end in Drosophila stock 2057). As in organisms with telomerase, their length varies depending on genotype. There is also slight under-replication in polytene nuclei. (2) Surprisingly, the relationship between the number of HeT-A and TART elements is not stochastic but is strongly correlated across stocks, supporting the idea that the two elements are interdependent. Although currently assembled portions of the HeT-A/TART arrays are from the most-proximal part of long arrays, approximately 61% of the total HeT-A sequence in these regions consists of intact, potentially active elements with little evidence of sequence decay, making it likely that the content of the telomere arrays turns over more extensively than has been thought.",2006,"Janet A George, P Gregory DeBaryshe, Karen L Traverse, Susan E Celniker, Mary-Lou Pardue, Janet A George, P Gregory DeBaryshe, Karen L Traverse, Susan E Celniker, Mary-Lou Pardue"
Native nonmuscle myosin II stability and light chain binding in Drosophila melanogaster,16917818,10.1002/cm.20148,"Native nonmuscle myosin IIs play essential roles in cellular and developmental processes throughout phylogeny. Individual motor molecules consist of a heterohexameric complex of three polypeptides which, when properly assembled, are capable of force generation. Here, we more completely characterize the properties, relationships and associations that each subunit has with one another in Drosophila melanogaster. All three native nonmuscle myosin II polypeptide subunits are expressed in close to constant stoichiometry to each other throughout development. We find that the stability of two subunits, the heavy chain and the regulatory light chain, depend on one another whereas the stability of the third subunit, the essential light chain, does not depend on either the heavy chain or regulatory light chain. We demonstrate that heavy chain aggregates, which form when regulatory light chain is lacking, associate with the essential light chain in vivo-thus showing that regulatory light chain association is required for heavy chain solubility. By immunodepletion we find that the majority of both light chains are associated with the nonmuscle myosin II heavy chain but pools of free light chain and/or light chain bound to other proteins are present. We identify four myosins (myosin II, myosin V, myosin VI and myosin VIIA) and a microtubule-associated protein (asp/Abnormal spindle) as binding partners for the essential light chain (but not the regulatory light chain) through mass spectrometry and co-precipitation. Using an in silico approach we identify six previously uncharacterized genes that contain IQ-motifs and may be essential light chain binding partners.",2006,"Josef D Franke, Amanda L Boury, Noel J Gerald, Daniel P Kiehart, Josef D Franke, Amanda L Boury, Noel J Gerald, Daniel P Kiehart"

The cascade of epigenetic events leading to the adult disconnected phenotype is caused by the misrouting of a larval pioneer nerve, Bolwig's nerve, during embryonic development. In the disconnected mutant this nerve fails to recognize and establish stable connections with its correct synaptic partners. In addition, disconnected affects both the proper aggregation and the movement of the Bolwig neurons to their final location in the embryo. Finally, similar but more subtle defects can be found in a subset of other peripheral neurons in the thoracic and abdominal segments.

Identification of nucleotide substitutions necessary for trans-activation of mariner transposable elements in Drosophila: analysis of naturally occurring elements,1655567,,"Six copies of the mariner element from the genomes of Drosophila mauritiana and Drosophila simulans were chosen at random for DNA sequencing and functional analysis and compared with the highly active element Mos1 and the inactive element peach. All elements were 1286 base pairs in length, but among them there were 18 nucleotide differences. As assayed in Drosophila melanogaster, three of the elements were apparently nonfunctional, two were marginally functional, and one had moderate activity that could be greatly increased depending on the position of the element in the genome. Both molecular (site-directed mutagenesis) and evolutionary (cladistic analysis) techniques were used to analyze the functional effects of nucleotide substitutions. The nucleotide sequence of the element is the primary determinant of function, though the activity level of elements is profoundly influenced by position effects. Cladistic analysis of the sequences has identified a T----A transversion at position 1203 (resulting in a Phe----Leu amino acid replacement in the putative transposase) as being primarily responsible for the low activity of the barely functional elements. Use of the sequences from the more distantly related species, Drosophila yakuba and Drosophila teissieri, as outside reference species, indicates that functional mariner elements are ancestral and argues against their origination by a novel mutation or by recombination among nonfunctional elements.",1991,"K Maruyama, K D Schoor, D L Hartl, K Maruyama, K D Schoor, D L Hartl"

Genetic studies have shown that the products of the dsx locus are required for correct somatic sexual differentiation of both sexes, and have suggested that each dsx product functions by repressing expression of terminal differentiation genes specific to the opposite sex. However, these studies have not shown whether the dsx gene products function directly to regulate the expression of target genes, or indirectly through another regulatory gene. We report here that the male- and female-specific DSX proteins, expressed in E.coli, bind directly and specifically in vitro to three DNA sequences located in an enhancer region that regulates female-specific expression of two target genes, the yolk protein genes 1 and 2.

The putative 60A protein shows greater sequence similarity to three vertebrate family members (human bone morphogenetic proteins 5, 6, and 7) than to its only Drosophila relative, the protein product of the decapentaplegic (dpp) gene. This observation suggests that the duplication event that gave rise to the two transforming growth factor beta-like proteins in Drosophila predates the divergence of chordates and arthropods.",1991,"K A Wharton, G H Thomsen, W M Gelbart, K A Wharton, G H Thomsen, W M Gelbart"

Dolichol levels in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster were determined at the larva and pupa stages and in 1, 10, 20 and 30-day-old flies. 2. Free dolichol increased from 1.2 micrograms/g wet weight in the larvae to 14.9 micrograms/g in 30-day-old flies, while total dolichol increased from 3.4 micrograms/g in the larvae to 21.2 micrograms/g at 30-days-old. 3. Dolichol released after saponification is primarily from dolichyl fatty acid ester, which accounts for up to 65% of the total dolichol. 4.

The optic lobe projection pattern of polarization-sensitive photoreceptor cells in Drosophila melanogaster,1913776,10.1007/BF00318153,"Histological staining of wild-type and sevenless transgenic Drosophila melanogaster bearing Rh3-lacZ fusion genes permits the selective visualization of polarization-sensitive R7 and R8 photoreceptor cells located along the dorsal anterior eye margin. Diffusion of beta-galactosidase throughout these cells reveals that they project long axons to the two most peripheral synaptic target rows of the dorsal posterior medulla, defining a specialized marginal zone of this optic lobe. Comparison of the staining patterns of marginal and nonmarginal Rh3-lacZ-expressing photoreceptor cells in the same histological preparations suggest that the marginal cells possess morphologically specialized axons and synaptic terminals. These findings are discussed with reference to the neuroanatomy of the corresponding dorsal marginal eye and optic lobe regions of the larger dipterans Musca and Calliphora, and in relation to the ability of Drosophila to orient to polarized light.",1991,"M E Fortini, G M Rubin, M E Fortini, G M Rubin"
In vitro metabolism of juvenile hormone III and juvenile hormone III bisepoxide by Drosophila melanogaster and mammalian cytosolic epoxide hydrolase,1910282,10.1016/0003-9861(91)90021-a,"In vitro metabolism of juvenile hormone III (JH III) and juvenile hormone III bisepoxide was investigated using purified mouse liver cytosolic epoxide hydrolase (cEH) and cell fractions from Drosophila melanogaster. JH III was metabolized faster than JH III bisepoxide by epoxide hydrolase activity in D. melanogaster cell fractions and by cEH. After incubation with JH III bisepoxide, all cell fractions and cEH produced epoxy-diol, cis- and trans-tetrahydrofuran-diols, and tetraol as metabolites. An increase in the concentration of cEH resulted in an increase in the proportion of tetraol as a JH III bisepoxide metabolite but this trend was not observed in the D. melanogaster cell fractions. Differences between cell fractions in the metabolism of JH III and JH III bisepoxide suggests the presence of juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase isozymes.",1991,"J Casas, L G Harshman, A Messeguer, E Kuwano, B D Hammock"
Subfreezing volumetric behavior and stochastic modeling of intracellular ice formation in Drosophila melanogaster embryos,1901783,10.1016/0011-2240(91)90009-d,"Cryomicroscopic observations were made of the volumetric behavior and kinetics of intracellular ice formation (IIF) in Drosophila melanogaster embryos in a modified cell culture medium (BD.20) or BD.20 + 2 M ethylene glycol. After rapid cooling to a given temperature, transient volumetric contraction of the embryos during the isothermal period was quantified by computerized video image analysis. Fitting these data to the numerical solution of the volume flux equation yielded estimates of the hydraulic permeability coefficient (Lp) for individual embryos at various subfreezing temperatures. Lp approximately followed an Arrhenius relation between -2 and -9 degrees C, with a value of 0.168 microns/(min-atm) extrapolated to 0 degrees C and an apparent activation energy delta E of 38.9 kcal/mol. IIF during an isothermal period occurred at random times whose characteristic temperature range and kinetics were affected by the presence of ethylene glycol. A stochastic process model developed to fit these data indicated the influence of both time-dependent and instantaneous components of IIF, presumed to be the result of seeding and heterogeneous nucleation, respectively. The presence of 2 M ethylene glycol depressed the characteristic temperature of instantaneous IIF by about 12 degrees C and reduced the rate constant for time-dependent IIF. Comparison with observed incidences of IIF yielded an estimate of the supercooling tolerance of 3 to 5 degrees C.",1991,"R E Pitt, S P Myers, T T Lin, P L Steponkus, R E Pitt, S P Myers, T T Lin, P L Steponkus"

Low-level chemiluminescence from Drosophila melanogaster fed with chemical mutagens polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon quinones and a carcinogenic bracken fern,1944380,10.1016/0027-5107(91)90218-d,"The spontaneous photon emission (chemiluminescence) from Drosophila melanogaster fed chemical mutagens, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon quinones, and a carcinogenic bracken fern was studied. The fly chemiluminescence was evidently enhanced by mutagen or carcinogen administration and was increased proportionally to the administered amount of tested compound. Strong chemiluminescence was observed especially at the larval stage. Living larvae emitted stronger chemiluminescence than their homogenate. The chemiluminescence from Drosophila melanogaster fed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon quinones showed a linear relation with the mutation frequency in the Drosophila wing spot test. The chemiluminescence from flies fed a bracken fern decreased by the addition of free radical scavengers and active oxygen quenchers. The phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide concentration in the flies was increased proportionally with the chemiluminescence intensity. It seems that the free radical formation is stimulated as shown by the enhanced chemiluminescence in mutagen- or carcinogen-dosed flies, and as a result, lipid peroxide accumulation accompanies mutation in Drosophila melanogaster.",1991,"T Sato, H Inaba, K Kawai, H Furukawa, I Hirono, T Miyazawa, T Sato, H Inaba, K Kawai, H Furukawa, I Hirono, T Miyazawa"

Rex and a suppressor of Rex are repeated neomorphic loci in the Drosophila melanogaster ribosomal DNA,1936953,,"The Rex locus of Drosophila melanogaster induces a high frequency of mitotic exchange between two separated ribosomal DNA arrays on a single chromosome.

Rex was mapped to the X centric heterochromatin, proximal to su(f), by genetic and molecular analysis of two spontaneous recombinants. Using deficiencies and duplications of the heterochromatin, both Rex and one Su(Rex) were shown to behave as neomorphs. Rex-induced exchange in a target chromosome bearing both Rex and Su(Rex) was then used to map these functions to the bb locus itself.

Increased internal and external bacterial load during Drosophila aging without life-span trade-off,17681150,10.1016/j.cmet.2007.06.006,"The role of microbial load during aging of the adult fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is incompletely understood. Here we show dramatic increases in aerobic and anaerobic bacterial load during aging, both inside the body and on the surface. Scanning electron microscopy and cell staining analyses of the surface of aged flies detected structures resembling abundant small bacteria and bacterial biofilms. Bacteria cultured from laboratory flies included aerobic species Acetobacter aceti, Acetobacter tropicalis, and Acetobacter pasteurianus and anaerobic species Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus sp. MR-2; Lactobacillus homohiochii, Lactobacillus fructivorans, and Lactobacillus brevis were identified by DNA sequencing. Reducing bacterial load and antimicrobial peptide gene expression by axenic culture or antibiotics had no effect on life span.

Carbonylation of mitochondrial proteins in Drosophila melanogaster during aging,17884014,10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.08.193,"Age-related changes in carbonylation of mitochondrial proteins were determined in mitochondria from the flight muscles of Drosophila melanogaster. Reactivity with antibodies against (i) adducts of dinitrophenyl hydrazone (DNP), commonly assumed to react broadly with derivatized carbonyl groups, (ii) malondialdehyde (MDA), or (iii) hydroxynonenal (HNE), was compared at five different ages of flies. MDA and HNE are carbonyl-containing products of lipid peroxidation, which can form covalent adducts with proteins. Specific objectives were to address the following inter-related issues: (1) what are the sources of adducts involved in protein carbonylation in mitochondria during aging; (2) is carbonylation by different adducts detectable solely by the DNP antibodies, as assumed widely; (3) can the adducts formed by lipid peroxidation products in vivo, be used as markers for monitoring age-associated changes in oxidative damage to proteins. The total amounts of immunoreactive proteins, detected by all three antibodies, were found to increase with age; however, the immunodensity of individual reactive bands and the magnitude of the increases were variable, and unrelated to the relative abundance of a protein. While some protein bands were strongly immunopositive for all three antibodies, others were quite selective. The amounts of high molecular weight cross-linked proteins (>200kDa) increased with age. In general, the anti-HNE antibody reacted with more protein bands compared to the anti-MDA or -DNP antibody. The results suggest that sources of the carbonyl-containing protein adducts vary and no single antibody reacts with all of them. Overall, the results indicate that HNE shows robust age-associated increases in adductation with mitochondrial proteins, and is a good marker for monitoring protein oxidative damage during aging.",2007,"Dikran Toroser, William C Orr, Rajindar S Sohal, Dikran Toroser, William C Orr, Rajindar S Sohal"
Gene family evolution across 12 Drosophila genomes,17997610,10.1371/journal.pgen.0030197,"Comparison of whole genomes has revealed large and frequent changes in the size of gene families. These changes occur because of high rates of both gene gain (via duplication) and loss (via deletion or pseudogenization), as well as the evolution of entirely new genes. Here we use the genomes of 12 fully sequenced Drosophila species to study the gain and loss of genes at unprecedented resolution. We find large numbers of both gains and losses, with over 40% of all gene families differing in size among the Drosophila. Approximately 17 genes are estimated to be duplicated and fixed in a genome every million years, a rate on par with that previously found in both yeast and mammals. We find many instances of extreme expansions or contractions in the size of gene families, including the expansion of several sex- and spermatogenesis-related families in D. melanogaster that also evolve under positive selection at the nucleotide level. Newly evolved gene families in our dataset are associated with a class of testes-expressed genes known to have evolved de novo in a number of cases. Gene family comparisons also allow us to identify a number of annotated D. melanogaster genes that are unlikely to encode functional proteins, as well as to identify dozens of previously unannotated D. melanogaster genes with conserved homologs in the other Drosophila. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the apparent stasis in total gene number among species has masked rapid turnover in individual gene gain and loss. It is likely that this genomic revolving door has played a large role in shaping the morphological, physiological, and metabolic differences among species.",2007,"Matthew W Hahn, Mira V Han, Sang-Gook Han, Matthew W Hahn, Mira V Han, Sang-Gook Han"
Mitch a rapidly evolving component of the Ndc80 kinetochore complex required for correct chromosome segregation in Drosophila,17895365,10.1242/jcs.012112,"We identified an essential kinetochore protein, Mitch, from a genetic screen in D. melanogaster. Mitch localizes to the kinetochore, and its targeting is independent of microtubules (MTs) and several other known kinetochore components. Animals carrying mutations in mitch die as late third-instar larvae; mitotic neuroblasts in larval brains exhibit high levels of aneuploidy. Analysis of fixed D. melanogaster brains and mitch RNAi in cultured cells, as well as video recordings of cultured mitch mutant neuroblasts, reveal that chromosome alignment in mitch mutants is compromised during spindle formation, with many chromosomes displaying persistent mono-orientation. These misalignments lead to aneuploidy during anaphase. Mutations in mitch also disrupt chromosome behavior during both meiotic divisions in spermatocytes: the entire chromosome complement often moves to only one spindle pole. Mutant mitotic cells exhibit contradictory behavior with respect to the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Anaphase onset is delayed in untreated cells, probably because incorrect kinetochore attachment maintains the SAC. However, mutant brain cells and mitch RNAi cells treated with MT poisons prematurely disjoin their chromatids, and exit mitosis. These data suggest that Mitch participates in SAC signaling that responds specifically to disruptions in spindle microtubule dynamics. The mitch gene corresponds to the transcriptional unit CG7242, and encodes a protein that is a possible ortholog of the Spc24 or Spc25 subunit of the Ndc80 kinetochore complex. Despite the crucial role of Mitch in cell division, the mitch gene has evolved very rapidly among species in the genus Drosophila.",2007,"Byron Williams, Garmay Leung, Helder Maiato, Alex Wong, Zexiao Li, Erika V Williams, Catherine Kirkpatrick, Charles F Aquadro, Conly L Rieder, Michael L Goldberg, Byron Williams, Garmay Leung, Helder Maiato, Alex Wong, Zexiao Li, Erika V Williams, Catherine Kirkpatrick, Charles F Aquadro, Conly L Rieder, Michael L Goldberg"
A functional heat shock protein 90 chaperone is essential for efficient flock house virus RNA polymerase synthesis in Drosophila cells,17522196,10.1128/JVI.00189-07,"The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is involved in multiple cellular processes including protein maturation, complex assembly and disassembly, and intracellular transport. We have recently shown that a disruption of Hsp90 activity in cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells suppresses Flock House virus (FHV) replication and the accumulation of protein A, the FHV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In the present study, we investigated whether the defect in FHV RNA polymerase accumulation induced by Hsp90 suppression was secondary to an effect on protein A synthesis, degradation, or intracellular membrane association. Treatment with the Hsp90-specific inhibitor geldanamycin selectively reduced FHV RNA polymerase synthesis by 80% in Drosophila S2 cells stably transfected with an inducible protein A expression plasmid. The suppressive effect of geldanamycin on protein A synthesis was not attenuated by proteasome inhibition, nor was it sensitive to changes in either the mRNA untranslated regions or protein A intracellular membrane localization. Furthermore, geldanamycin did not promote premature protein A degradation, nor did it alter the extremely rapid kinetics of protein A membrane association. These results identify a novel role for Hsp90 in facilitating viral RNA polymerase synthesis in Drosophila cells and suggest that FHV subverts normal cellular pathways to assemble functional replication complexes.",2007,"Kathryn M Castorena, Spencer A Weeks, Kenneth A Stapleford, Amy M Cadwallader, David J Miller, Kathryn M Castorena, Spencer A Weeks, Kenneth A Stapleford, Amy M Cadwallader, David J Miller"

Joint inference of the distribution of fitness effects of deleterious mutations and population demography based on nucleotide polymorphism frequencies,18073430,10.1534/genetics.107.080663,"The distribution of fitness effects of new mutations (DFE) is important for addressing several questions in genetics, including the nature of quantitative variation and the evolutionary fate of small populations. Properties of the DFE can be inferred by comparing the distributions of the frequencies of segregating nucleotide polymorphisms at selected and neutral sites in a population sample, but demographic changes alter the spectrum of allele frequencies at both neutral and selected sites, so can bias estimates of the DFE if not accounted for. We have developed a maximum-likelihood approach, based on the expected allele-frequency distribution generated by transition matrix methods, to estimate parameters of the DFE while simultaneously estimating parameters of a demographic model that allows a population size change at some time in the past. We tested the method using simulations and found that it accurately recovers simulated parameter values, even if the simulated demography differs substantially from that assumed in our analysis. We use our method to estimate parameters of the DFE for amino acid-changing mutations in humans and Drosophila melanogaster. For a model of unconditionally deleterious mutations, with effects sampled from a gamma distribution, the mean estimate for the distribution shape parameter is approximately 0.2 for human populations, which implies that the DFE is strongly leptokurtic. For Drosophila populations, we estimate that the shape parameter is approximately 0.35. Differences in the shape of the distribution and the mean selection coefficient between humans and Drosophila result in significantly more strongly deleterious mutations in Drosophila than in humans, and, conversely, nearly neutral mutations are significantly less frequent.",2007,"Peter D Keightley, Adam Eyre-Walker, Peter D Keightley, Adam Eyre-Walker"
No influence of Indy on lifespan in Drosophila after correction for genetic and cytoplasmic background effects,17571923,10.1371/journal.pgen.0030095,"To investigate whether alterations in mitochondrial metabolism affect longevity in Drosophila melanogaster, we studied lifespan in various single gene mutants, using inbred and outbred genetic backgrounds. As positive controls we included the two most intensively studied mutants of Indy, which encodes a Drosophila Krebs cycle intermediate transporter. It has been reported that flies heterozygous for these Indy mutations, which lie outside the coding region, show almost a doubling of lifespan. We report that only one of the two mutants lowers mRNA levels, implying that the lifespan extension observed is not attributable to the Indy mutations themselves. Moreover, neither Indy mutation extended lifespan in female flies in any genetic background tested. In the original genetic background, only the Indy mutation associated with altered RNA expression extended lifespan in male flies. However, this effect was abolished by backcrossing into standard outbred genetic backgrounds, and was associated with an unidentified locus on the X chromosome. The original Indy line with long-lived males is infected by the cytoplasmic symbiont Wolbachia, and the longevity of Indy males disappeared after tetracycline clearance of this endosymbiont. These findings underscore the critical importance of standardisation of genetic background and of cytoplasm in genetic studies of lifespan, and show that the lifespan extension previously claimed for Indy mutants was entirely attributable to confounding variation from these two sources.

Genes encoding effector proteins, and to a lesser extent genes encoding recognition proteins, are much more likely to vary in copy number across species than genes encoding signaling proteins. Furthermore, we can trace the apparent recent origination of several evolutionarily novel immune-related genes and gene families. Using codon-based likelihood methods, we show that immune-system genes, and especially those encoding recognition proteins, evolve under positive darwinian selection.

The chemical component of the mixed GF-TTMn synapse in Drosophila melanogaster uses acetylcholine as its neurotransmitter,17650116,10.1111/j.1460-9568.2007.05686.x,"The largest central synapse in adult Drosophila is a mixed electro-chemical synapse whose gap junctions require the product of the shaking-B (shak-B) gene. Shak-B(2) mutant flies lack gap junctions at this synapse, which is between the giant fibre (GF) and the tergotrochanteral motor neuron (TTMn), but it still exhibits a long latency response upon GF stimulation. We have targeted the expression of the light chain of tetanus toxin to the GF, to block chemical transmission, in shak-B(2) flies. The long latency response in the tergotrochanteral muscle (TTM) was abolished indicating that the chemical component of the synapse mediates this response. Attenuation of GAL4-mediated labelling by a cha-GAL80 transgene, reveals the GF to be cholinergic. We have used a temperature-sensitive allele of the choline acetyltransferase gene (cha(ts2)) to block cholinergic synapses in adult flies and this also abolished the long latency response in shak-B(2) flies.

Drosophila Ctr1A functions as a copper transporter essential for development,17573340,10.1074/jbc.M703792200,"Copper is an essential trace element required by all aerobic organisms as a cofactor for enzymes involved in normal growth, development, and physiology. Ctr1 proteins are members of a highly conserved family of copper importers responsible for copper uptake across the plasma membrane. Mice lacking Ctr1 die during embryogenesis from widespread developmental defects, demonstrating the need for adequate copper acquisition in the development of metazoan organisms via as yet uncharacterized mechanisms. Whereas the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, expresses three Ctr1 genes, ctr1A, ctr1B, and ctr1C, little is known about their protein isoform-specific roles. Previous studies demonstrated that Ctr1B localizes to the plasma membrane and is not essential for development unless flies are severely copper-deficient or are subjected to copper toxicity. Here we demonstrate that Ctr1A also resides on the plasma membrane and is the primary Drosophila copper transporter. Loss of Ctr1A results in copper-remedial developmental arrest at early larval stages. Ctr1A mutants are deficient in the activity of copper-dependent enzymes, including cytochrome c oxidase and tyrosinase. Amidation of Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amides, a group of cardiomodulatory neuropeptide hormones that are matured via the action of peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase, is defective in neuroendocrine cells of Ctr1A mutant larvae. Moreover, both the Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide maturation and heart beat rate defects observed in Ctr1A mutant larvae can be partially rescued by exogenous copper. These studies establish clear physiological distinctions between two Drosophila plasma membrane copper transport proteins and demonstrate that copper import by Ctr1A is required to drive neuropeptide maturation during normal growth and development.",2007,"Michelle L Turski, Dennis J Thiele, Michelle L Turski, Dennis J Thiele"

To determine the events within the female reproductive tract that occur during sperm storage, and the role that Acps and sperm play in these events, we identified morphological changes that take place during sperm storage in females mated to wild-type, Acp-deficient or sperm-deficient males. A reproducible set of morphological changes occurs in a wild-type mating. These were categorized into 10 stereotypic stages. Sperm are not needed for progression through these stages in females, but receipt of Acps is essential for progression beyond the first few stages of morphological change. Furthermore, females that received small quantities of Acps reached slightly later stages than females that received no Acps.

The relationship of the redox potentials of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase from Drosophila melanogaster to the enzymatic mechanism: reduced thioredoxin is the reductant of glutathione in Drosophila,17550271,10.1021/bi700442r,"Thioredoxin reductase from Drosophila melanogaster (DmTrxR) catalyzes the reversible transfer of reducing equivalents between NADPH and thioredoxin (Trx), a small protein that is involved in a wide variety of biological redox processes. The catalysis involves three essential redox states of the enzyme: the oxidized form of DmTrxR (Eox), the 2-electron-reduced forms (EH2), and the 4-electron-reduced forms (EH4). In the present work, the macroscopic redox potentials of Eox/EH2 and EH2/EH4 couples were determined to be -272 +/- 5 mV for Em(Eox/EH2) and -298 +/- 11 mV for Em(EH2/EH4) on the basis of redox equilibria between DmTrxR and NADH. The value for Em(EH2/EH4) obtained from the steady-state kinetics of the TrxR-catalyzed reaction between NADPH and D. melanogaster Trx-2 (DmTrx-2) was reasonably consistent with that based on redox equilibria. The redox potential of the Trx-(S)2/Trx-(SH)2 couple from D. melanogaster Trx-2 (DmTrx-2) was calculated to be -275.4 +/- 0.3 mV by using the Nernst equation and the Keq for the equilibrium of the reaction involving NADP/NADPH and Trx-(S)2/Trx-(SH)2. For the accurate determination of the Keq, an improved protocol has been developed to minimize errors that can be introduced by using starting concentrations far from equilibrium of the TrxR-catalyzed reaction between NADPH and Trx. This improved approach gives an Em of -284.2 +/- 1.0 mV for Escherichia coli Trx and -271.9 +/- 0.4 mV for Plasmodium falciparum Trx, which agree well with published values (-283 or -285 mV and -270 mV, respectively). The redox potentials determined herein provide further direct evidence for the proposed catalytic mechanism of DmTrxR, and cast new light on the essential role of the DmTrx system in cycling GSSG/GSH and maintaining the intracellular redox homeostasis in D. melanogaster where glutathione reductase is absent.",2007,"Zhiyong Cheng, L David Arscott, David P Ballou, Charles H Williams Jr, Zhiyong Cheng, L David Arscott, David P Ballou, Charles H Williams Jr"
A role for Hemolectin in coagulation and immunity in Drosophila melanogaster,17509683,10.1016/j.dci.2007.03.012,"Hemolectin has been identified as a candidate clotting factor in Drosophila. We reassessed the domain structure of Hemolectin (Hml) and propose that instead of C-type lectin domains, the two discoidin domains are most likely responsible for the protein's lectin activity. We also tested Hml's role in coagulation and immunity in Drosophila. Here we describe the isolation of a new hml allele in a forward screen for coagulation mutants, and our characterization of this and two other hml alleles, one of which is a functional null. While loss of Hml had strong effects on larval hemolymph coagulation ex vivo, mutant larvae survived wounding. Drosophila thus possesses redundant hemostatic mechanisms. We also found that loss of Hml in immune-handicapped adults rendered them more sensitive to Gram(-) bacterial infection. This demonstrates an immunological role of this clotting protein and reinforces the importance of the clot in insect immunity.",2007,"Christine Lesch, Akira Goto, Malin Lindgren, Gawa Bidla, Mitchell S Dushay, Ulrich Theopold, Christine Lesch, Akira Goto, Malin Lindgren, Gawa Bidla, Mitchell S Dushay, Ulrich Theopold"
Research on the karyotype and evolution of Drosophila melanogaster species group,17498617,10.1016/S1673-8527(07)60021-6,"Mitotic metaphase chromosomes of 34 species of Drosophila melanogaster species group were examined. Certain new karyotypes were described for the first time, and their evolutionary and interspecific genetic relationships among 8 subgroups of D. melanogaster species group were analyzed systematically. The results were as follows. The basic karyotype of elegans subgroup was type A. The karyotypes of eugracilis subgroup, melanogaster subgroup, and ficusphila subgroup were all type C. The karyotypes of takahashii subgroup and suzukii subgroup were both type C and type D. The montium subgroup had six kinds of karyotypes: types B, C, C', D, D', and E. The ananassae subgroup had three kinds of karyotypes: types F, G, and H. Thus, the melanogaster species group was classified into five pedigrees based on the diversity of these karyotypes: 1) elegans; 2) eugracilis-melanogaster-ficusphila; 3) takkahashii-suzukii; 4) montium; 5) ananassae. The above-mentioned results in karyotypic evolution were consistent with those of DNA sequence analysis reported by Yang except for the elegans subgroup and this subgroup was considered as the ancestral subgroup.

During embryonic development, the midgut visceral muscle is lined by the endodermal cell layer. In this paper, we have investigated signalling between these two tissues. Here, we show that Alk function is required for decapentaplegic (Dpp) expression and subsequent signalling via the Mad pathway in the developing gut. We propose that not only does Alk signalling regulate founder cell specification and thus fusion in the developing visceral muscle, but that Alk also regulates Dpp signalling between the visceral muscle and the endoderm.

Spatial organization of a ubiquitous eukaryotic kinetochore protein network in Drosophila chromosomes,17333235,10.1007/s00412-007-0103-y,"Chromosome segregation during meiosis and mitosis depends on the assembly of functional kinetochores within centromeric regions. Centromeric DNA and kinetochore proteins show surprisingly little sequence conservation despite their fundamental biological role. However, our identification in Drosophila melanogaster of the most diverged orthologs identified so far, which encode components of a kinetochore protein network including the Ndc80 and Mis complexes, further emphasizes the notion of a shared eukaryotic kinetochore design. To determine its spatial organization, we have analyzed by quantitative light microscopy hundreds of native chromosomes from transgenic Drosophila strains coexpressing combinations of red and green fluorescent fusion proteins, fully capable of providing the essential wild-type functions. Thereby, Cenp-A/Cid, Cenp-C, Mis12 and the Ndc80 complex were mapped along the inter sister kinetochore axis with a resolution below 10 nm. The C terminus of Cenp-C was found to be near but well separated from the innermost component Cenp-A/Cid.

A systems biology analysis of the Drosophila phagosome,17151602,10.1038/nature05380,"Phagocytes have a critical function in remodelling tissues during embryogenesis and thereafter are central effectors of immune defence. During phagocytosis, particles are internalized into 'phagosomes', organelles from which immune processes such as microbial destruction and antigen presentation are initiated. Certain pathogens have evolved mechanisms to evade the immune system and persist undetected within phagocytes, and it is therefore evident that a detailed knowledge of this process is essential to an understanding of many aspects of innate and adaptive immunity. However, despite the crucial role of phagosomes in immunity, their components and organization are not fully defined. Here we present a systems biology analysis of phagosomes isolated from cells derived from the genetically tractable model organism Drosophila melanogaster and address the complex dynamic interactions between proteins within this organelle and their involvement in particle engulfment. Proteomic analysis identified 617 proteins potentially associated with Drosophila phagosomes; these were organized by protein-protein interactions to generate the 'phagosome interactome', a detailed protein-protein interaction network of this subcellular compartment. These networks predicted both the architecture of the phagosome and putative biomodules. The contribution of each protein and complex to bacterial internalization was tested by RNA-mediated interference and identified known components of the phagocytic machinery. In addition, the prediction and validation of regulators of phagocytosis such as the 'exocyst', a macromolecular complex required for exocytosis but not previously implicated in phagocytosis, validates this strategy. In generating this 'systems-based model', we show the power of applying this approach to the study of complex cellular processes and organelles and expect that this detailed model of the phagosome will provide a new framework for studying host-pathogen interactions and innate immunity.",2007,"L M Stuart, J Boulais, G M Charriere, E J Hennessy, S Brunet, I Jutras, G Goyette, C Rondeau, S Letarte, H Huang, P Ye, F Morales, C Kocks, J S Bader, M Desjardins, R A B Ezekowitz, L M Stuart, J Boulais, G M Charriere, E J Hennessy, S Brunet, I Jutras, G Goyette, C Rondeau, S Letarte, H Huang, P Ye, F Morales, C Kocks, J S Bader, M Desjardins, R A B Ezekowitz"
Molecular analysis of sleep: wake cycles in Drosophila,18419315,10.1101/sqb.2007.72.018,"Sleep is controlled by two major regulatory systems: a circadian system that drives it with a 24-hour periodicity and a home-ostatic system that ensures that adequate amounts of sleep are obtained. We are using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to understand both types of regulation. With respect to circadian control, we have identified molecular mechanisms that are critical for the generation of a clock. Our recent efforts have focused on the analysis of posttranslational mechanisms, specifically the action of different phosphatases that control the phosphorylation and thereby the stability and/or nuclear localization of circadian clock proteins period (PER) and timeless (TIM). Resetting the clock in response to light is also mediated through posttranslational events that target TIM for degradation by the proteasome pathway; a recently identified ubiquitin ligase, jet lag (JET), is required for this response. Our understanding of the homeostatic control of sleep is in its early stages. We have found that mushroom bodies, which are a site of synaptic plasticity in the fly brain, are important for the regulation of sleep. In addition, through analysis of genes expressed under different behavioral states, we have identified some that are up-regulated during sleep deprivation.

We found that full-size P and KP elements were the two major size classes of P elements present in the genomes of all populations (""FP + KP predominance"") and that the P-related phenotypes had largely not changed since the 1980s. Both FP + KP predominance and phenotypic stability were also seen in other populations from other continents. As North American populations did not show many KP elements in earlier samples, we hypothesize that KP elements have spread and multiplied in the last 20 years in North America.

Theory predicts that rare, partially recessive deleterious alleles should cause a much larger change in the effect of inbreeding than in the mean of the outbred population, with the change in inbreeding effect having an opposite sign to the change in mean.

However, these pros mutations had no effect on female sexual receptivity and did not alter other male phenotypes related to mating behavior.

Drosophila spichthyin inhibits BMP signaling and regulates synaptic growth and axonal microtubules,17220882,10.1038/nn1841,"To understand the functions of NIPA1, mutated in the neurodegenerative disease hereditary spastic paraplegia, and of ichthyin, mutated in autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, we have studied their Drosophila melanogaster ortholog, spichthyin (Spict). Spict is found on early endosomes. Loss of Spict leads to upregulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and expansion of the neuromuscular junction. BMP signaling is also necessary for a normal microtubule cytoskeleton and axonal transport; analysis of loss- and gain-of-function phenotypes indicate that Spict may antagonize this function of BMP signaling. Spict interacts with BMP receptors and promotes their internalization from the plasma membrane, implying that it inhibits BMP signaling by regulating BMP receptor traffic. This is the first demonstration of a role for a hereditary spastic paraplegia protein or ichthyin family member in a specific signaling pathway, and implies disease mechanisms for hereditary spastic paraplegia that involve dependence of the microtubule cytoskeleton on BMP signaling.",2007,"Xinnan Wang, W Robert Shaw, Hilda T H Tsang, Evan Reid, Cahir J O'Kane, Xinnan Wang, W Robert Shaw, Hilda T H Tsang, Evan Reid, Cahir J O'Kane"

Our results show that salicylate is transported into the lumen of the Malpighian tubules in all the species evaluated, except Rhodnius prolixus. The transepithelial transport of salicylate by the Malpighian tubules of Drosophila simulans, Drosophila erecta, Drosophila sechellia, and Acheta domesticus was saturable, Na(+)-dependent and inhibited by alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid.

The presence of both salicylate and salicylate metabolites in the secreted fluid samples from the Malpighian tubules of A. domesticus, R. prolixus, T. molitor, and T. ni indicates that insect Malpighian tubules may both transport and metabolize salicylate.

Adult locomotory activity mediates intralocus sexual conflict in a laboratory-adapted population of Drosophila melanogaster,17925279,10.1098/rspb.2007.1140,"The strongest form of intralocus sexual conflict occurs when two conditions are met: (i) there is a positive intersexual genetic correlation for a trait and (ii) the selection gradients on the trait in the two sexes are in opposite directions. Intralocus sexual conflict can constrain the adaptive evolution of both sexes and thereby contribute to a species' 'gender load'. Previous studies of adult lifetime fitness of the same sets of genes expressed in both males and females have established that there is substantial intralocus conflict in the LHM laboratory-adapted population of Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we investigated whether a highly dimorphic trait-adult locomotory activity-contributed substantially to the established intralocus sexual conflict. To measure the selection gradient on activity level, both this trait and adult lifetime fitness were measured under the same environmental conditions to which the flies were adapted. We found significant phenotypic variation in both sexes for adult locomotory activity, and that the selection gradients on this variation were large and in opposite directions in the two sexes. Using hemiclonal analysis to screen 99% of the entire genome, we found abundant genetic variation for adult locomotory activity and showed that this variation occurs on both the X and autosomes.

An experimental test for indirect benefits in Drosophila melanogaster,17349042,10.1186/1471-2148-7-36,"Background:
      
    

    
      Despite much empirical attention, tests for indirect benefits of mate choice have rarely considered the major components of sexual and nonsexual offspring fitness relevant to a population. Here we use a novel experimental design to test for the existence of any indirect benefits in a laboratory adapted population of D. melanogaster. Our experiment compared the fitness (mating success, longevity, and productivity) of individuals possessing genomes that derived two generations previously from males that were either entirely successful (studs) or wholly unsuccessful (duds) at achieving mates in three subsequent rounds of mating trials.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Males from the stud treatment were 30% more successful on average at securing mates than males from the dud treatment. In contrast, we found no difference between treatments in measures of productivity or of longevity when measured in a mixed-sex environment. In the absence of females, however, males in the stud treatment outlived males in the dud treatment.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our results suggest that mating with successful males in this population provides an indirect benefit to females and that, at least in this environment, the benefit arises primarily through the production of more attractive male offspring. However, it is unclear whether this represents solely a traditional sexy sons benefit or whether there is an additional good genes component (with male offspring simply allocating their surplus condition to traits that enhance their mating success). The lack of any detectable differences in female fitness between the two treatments suggests the former, although the longevity advantage of males in the stud treatment when females were absent is consistent with the latter. Determining the effect of this indirect benefit on the evolution of female mate preferences (or resistance) will require comparable data on the direct costs of mating with various males, and an understanding of how these costs and benefits integrate across generations and vary among environments.",2007,"Howard D Rundle, Anders Odeen, Arne ?

REDfly 2.0: an integrated database of cis-regulatory modules and transcription factor binding sites in Drosophila,18039705,10.1093/nar/gkm876,"The identification and study of the cis-regulatory elements that control gene expression are important areas of biological research, but few resources exist to facilitate large-scale bioinformatics studies of cis-regulation in metazoan species. Drosophila melanogaster, with its well-annotated genome, exceptional resources for comparative genomics and long history of experimental studies of transcriptional regulation, represents the ideal system for regulatory bioinformatics. We have merged two existing Drosophila resources, the REDfly database of cis-regulatory modules and the FlyReg database of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), into a single integrated database containing extensive annotation of empirically validated cis-regulatory modules and their constituent binding sites. With the enhanced functionality made possible through this integration of TFBS data into REDfly, together with additional improvements to the REDfly infrastructure, we have constructed a one-stop portal for Drosophila cis-regulatory data that will serve as a powerful resource for both computational and experimental studies of transcriptional regulation.

High incidence of interchromosomal transpositions in the evolutionary history of a subset of or genes in Drosophila,18330486,10.1007/s00239-008-9071-y,"In insects, the odorant receptor (Or) multigene family is an intermediate-sized family with genes present in all chromosomes, indicating that duplication followed by interchromosomal transposition played an important role in the early stages of the family evolution. Here, we have explored the occurrence of interchromosomal transpositions in more recent stages through the comparative analysis of a subset of Or genes in Drosophila, where the gene content of chromosomal arms is highly conserved. The studied subset consisted of 11 Or genes located on the left arm of chromosome 3 (Muller's D element) in D. melanogaster. Our study focused on the number and chromosomal arm location of these members of the family across the 12 Drosophila species with complete genome sequences.

Structure of the Drosophila nucleosome core particle highlights evolutionary constraints on the H2A-H2B histone dimer,17957772,10.1002/prot.21720,"We determined the 2.45 A crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle from Drosophila melanogaster and compared it to that of Xenopus laevis bound to the identical 147 base-pair DNA fragment derived from human alpha-satellite DNA. Differences between the two structures primarily reflect 16 amino acid substitutions between species, 15 of which are in histones H2A and H2B. Four of these involve histone tail residues, resulting in subtly altered protein-DNA interactions that exemplify the structural plasticity of these tails. Of the 12 substitutions occurring within the histone core regions, five involve small, solvent-exposed residues not involved in intraparticle interactions. The remaining seven involve buried hydrophobic residues, and appear to have coevolved so as to preserve the volume of side chains within the H2A hydrophobic core and H2A-H2B dimer interface. Thus, apart from variations in the histone tails, amino acid substitutions that differentiate Drosophila from Xenopus histones occur in mutually compensatory combinations.

Distinct memories of odor intensity and quality in Drosophila,18824685,10.1073/pnas.0804086105,"Even in a simple Pavlovian memory task an animal may form several associations that can be independently assessed by the appropriate tests. Studying conditioned odor discrimination of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster we found that animals store quality and intensity of an odor as separate memory traces. The trace of odor intensity is short-lived, decaying in <3 h. Only the last intensity value is stored. In contrast to odor-quality memory, odor-intensity memory does not require the rutabaga-dependent cAMP signaling pathway. Flies rely on their memory of intensity in a narrow concentration range in which they can generalize intensity. Larger concentration differences they treat like different qualities. This study shows that the perceptual identity of an odor is based on at least three lines of processing in the brain: (i) a memory of odor quality, (ii) a memory of odor intensity, and (iii) a range of intensities (and qualities), in which the odor is generalized.",2008,"Pavel Masek, Martin Heisenberg, Pavel Masek, Martin Heisenberg"

B. mori has a unique recognition gene and antimicrobial peptide genes that are not present in the Drosophila, Anopheles, Apis and Tribolium genomes, suggesting a lineage-specific gene evolution for lepidopteran insects. The comparative analysis of the insect immune repertoires indicated a dynamic and flexible gene expansion in recognition, modulation and effector mechanisms due to different selection pressures.

dSETDB1 and SU(VAR)3-9 sequentially function during germline-stem cell differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster,18493619,10.1371/journal.pone.0002234,"Germline-stem cells (GSCs) produce gametes and are thus true ""immortal stem cells"". In Drosophila ovaries, GSCs divide asymmetrically to produce daughter GSCs and cystoblasts, and the latter differentiate into germline cysts. Here we show that the histone-lysine methyltransferase dSETDB1, located in pericentric heterochromatin, catalyzes H3-K9 trimethylation in GSCs and their immediate descendants. As germline cysts differentiate into egg chambers, the dSETDB1 function is gradually taken over by another H3-K9-specific methyltransferase, SU(VAR)3-9. Loss-of-function mutations in dsetdb1 or Su(var)3-9 abolish both H3K9me3 and heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1) signals from the anterior germarium and the developing egg chambers, respectively, and cause localization of H3K9me3 away from DNA-dense regions in most posterior germarium cells.

Direct harm to females, however, can potentially be counterbalanced by indirect genetic benefits, where females make up for a reduction in offspring quantity by an increase in offspring quality through a generic increase in offspring fitness (good genes) and/or one restricted to the context of sexual selection (sexy sons). Here, we quantify the magnitude of the good genes mechanism of indirect benefits in a laboratory-adapted population of Drosophila melanogaster. We find that despite high-standing genetic variance for fitness, females gain at most only a modest benefit through the good genes form of indirect benefits--far too little to counterbalance the direct cost of male-induced harm.",2008,"A D Stewart, A M Hannes, A Mirzatuny, W R Rice, A D Stewart, A M Hannes, A Mirzatuny, W R Rice"

We find that changing visual context between training and test does not deteriorate olfactory memory scores, suggesting that these olfactory memories can drive behaviour despite a mismatch of visual context between training and test. Rather, both the establishment and the recall of olfactory memory are generally facilitated by light. In a follow-up experiment, we find no evidence for learning about combinations of odours and visual context as predictors for reinforcement even after explicit training in a so-called biconditional discrimination task. Thus, a 'true' interaction between visual and olfactory modalities is not evident; instead, light seems to influence olfactory learning and recall unspecifically, for example by altering motor activity, alertness or olfactory acuity.",2008,"Ayse Yarali, Moritz Mayerle, Christian Nawroth, Bertram Gerber, Ayse Yarali, Moritz Mayerle, Christian Nawroth, Bertram Gerber"
Metabolomic signatures of inbreeding at benign and stressful temperatures in Drosophila melanogaster,18791253,10.1534/genetics.108.089144,"While the population genetics of inbreeding is fairly well understood, the effects of inbreeding on the physiological and biochemical levels are not. Here we have investigated the effects of inbreeding on the Drosophila melanogaster metabolome. Metabolite fingerprints in males from five outbred and five inbred lines were studied by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy after exposure to benign temperature, heat stress, or cold stress. In both the absence and the presence of temperature stress, metabolite levels were significantly different among inbred and outbred lines. The major effect of inbreeding was increased levels of maltose and decreased levels of 3-hydroxykynurenine and a galactoside [1-O-(4-O-(2-aminoethyl phosphate)-beta-d-galactopyranosyl)-x-glycerol] synthesized exclusively in the paragonial glands of Drosophila species, including D. melanogaster. The metabolomic effect of inbreeding at the benign temperature was related to gene expression data from the same inbred and outbred lines. Both gene expression and metabolite data indicate that fundamental metabolic processes are changed or modified by inbreeding. Apart from affecting mean metabolite levels, inbreeding led to an increased between-line variation in metabolite profiles compared to outbred lines. In contrast to previous observations revealing interactions between inbreeding and environmental stress on gene expression patterns and life-history traits, the effect of inbreeding on the metabolite profile was similar across the different temperature treatments.",2008,"Kamilla Sofie Pedersen, Torsten Nygaard Kristensen, Volker Loeschcke, Bent O Petersen, Jens ?

Tissue-specific targeting of Hsp26 has no effect on heat resistance of neural function in larval Drosophila,18347945,10.1007/s12192-008-0016-6,"Hsp26 belongs to the small heat-shock protein family and is normally expressed in all cells during heat stress. We aimed to determine if overexpression of this protein protects behavior and neural function in Drosophila melanogaster during heat stress, as has previously been shown for Hsp70. We used the UAS-GAL4 expression system to drive expression of Hsp26 in the whole animal (ubiquitously), in the motoneurons, and in the muscles of wandering third-instar larvae. There were slight increases in time to crawling failure and normalized excitatory junction potential (EJP) area for some of the transgenic lines, but these were not consistent. In addition, Hsp26 had no effect on the temperature at failure of EJPs, normalized EJP peak amplitude, and normalized EJP half-width. Overexpression larvae had a similar number of motoneuronal boutons and length of nerve terminals as controls, indicating that the occasional protective effects on locomotion were not due to changes at the synapse. We conclude that overexpression had a small thermoprotective effect on locomotion and no effect on neural function. As it has been shown that Hsp26 requires action of other Hsps to reactivate the denatured proteins to which it binds, we propose that at least in larvae, the function of Hsp26 was masked in the relative absence of other Hsps.",2008,"Viara Mileva-Seitz, Chengfeng Xiao, Laurent Seroude, R Meldrum Robertson, Viara Mileva-Seitz, Chengfeng Xiao, Laurent Seroude, R Meldrum Robertson"
Climatic adaptations of body melanisation in Drosophila melanogaster from Western Himalayas,18820467,10.4161/fly.6351,"We investigated population divergence in body melanisation in wild samples of Drosophila melanogaster across an elevational gradient (512-2202 m) in the Western Himalayas. Wild populations are characterized by higher phenotypic variability as compared with laboratory populations. Significant differences in elevational slope values for three posterior abdominal segments (fifth, sixth and seventh) in wild versus laboratory populations suggest plastic effects. However, elevational slope values do not differ for the three anterior abdominal segments (second, third and fourth). Thus, elevational changes in melanisation include genetic as well as plastic effects. Fitness consequences of within population variability were analyzed on the basis of assorted darker and lighter flies from two highlands as well as from two lowland localities. There is lack of correlation of melanisation with body size as well as ovariole number in assorted darker and lighter flies. For each population, darker flies showed higher desiccation resistance, lower rate of water loss, longer copulation duration and greater fecundity as compared with lighter flies. Phenotypic variations in body melanisation can be interpreted in relation with seasonal changes in temperature as well as humidity (Tcv and RHcv) of the sites of origin of populations. Thus, elevational changes in body melanisation may represent genetic response to selection pressures imposed by colder and drier climatic conditions in the Western Himalayas.",2008,"Ravi Parkash, Vineeta Sharma, Bhawna Kalra, Ravi Parkash, Vineeta Sharma, Bhawna Kalra"

Nonadaptive explanations for signatures of partial selective sweeps in Drosophila,18199829,10.1093/molbev/msn007,"A beneficial mutation that has nearly but not yet fixed in a population produces a characteristic haplotype configuration, called a partial selective sweep.

We use coalescent simulations to explore whether incorporation of the species' demographic history, purifying selection against the element, or suppression of recombination caused by the element could generate putatively adaptive haplotype configurations. Whereas most of the data sets would be rejected as nonneutral under the standard neutral null model, only the data set for which there is strong external evidence in support of an adaptive transposition appears to be nonneutral under the more complex null model and in particular when demography is taken into account.

Developmental stage and level of codon usage bias in Drosophila,18755761,10.1093/molbev/msn189,"Codon usage bias (CUB) is a ubiquitous observation in molecular evolution. As a model, Drosophila has been particularly well-studied and indications show that selection at least partially controls codon usage, probably through selection for translational efficiency. Although many aspects of Drosophila CUB have been studied, this is the first study relating codon usage to development in this holometabolous insect with very different life stages. Here we ask the question: What developmental stage of Drosophila melanogaster has the greatest CUB? Genes with maximum expression in the larval stage have the greatest overall CUB when compared with embryos, pupae, and adults. (The same pattern was observed in Drosophila pseudoobscura, see Supplementary Material online.) We hypothesize this is related to the very rapid growth of larvae, placing increased selective pressure to produce large amounts of protein: a 300-fold increase requiring an approximate doubling of protein content every 10 h. Genes with highest expression in adult males and early embryos, stages with the least de novo protein synthesis, display the least CUB. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that CUB is caused (at least in part) by selection for efficient protein production. This seems to hold on the individual gene level (highly expressed genes are more biased than lowly expressed genes) as well as on a more global scale where genes with maximum expression during times of very rapid growth and protein synthesis are more biased than genes with maximum expression during times of low growth.",2008,"Saverio Vicario, Christopher E Mason, Kevin P White, Jeffrey R Powell, Saverio Vicario, Christopher E Mason, Kevin P White, Jeffrey R Powell"

Drosophila bloom helicase maintains genome integrity by inhibiting recombination between divergent DNA sequences,18978019,10.1093/nar/gkn793,"DNA double strand breaks (DSB) can be repaired either via a sequence independent joining of DNA ends or via homologous recombination. We established a detection system in Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the impact of sequence constraints on the usage of the homology based DSB repair via single strand annealing (SSA), which leads to recombination between direct repeats with concomitant loss of one repeat copy. First of all, we find the SSA frequency to be inversely proportional to the spacer length between the repeats, for spacers up to 2.4 kb in length. We further show that SSA between divergent repeats (homeologous SSA) is suppressed in cell cultures and in vivo in a sensitive manner, recognizing sequence divergences smaller than 0.5%. Finally, we demonstrate that the suppression of homeologous SSA depends on the Bloom helicase (Blm), encoded by the Drosophila gene mus309. Suppression of homeologous recombination is a novel function of Blm in ensuring genomic integrity, not described to date in mammalian systems. Unexpectedly, distinct from its function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mismatch repair factor Msh2 encoded by spel1 does not suppress homeologous SSA in Drosophila.",2008,"Michael Kappeler, Elisabeth Kranz, Katrina Woolcock, Oleg Georgiev, Walter Schaffner, Michael Kappeler, Elisabeth Kranz, Katrina Woolcock, Oleg Georgiev, Walter Schaffner"

Vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamylcarboxylation: an ancient posttranslational modification,18374194,10.1016/S0083-6729(07)00008-8,"The vitamin K-dependent carboxylase carries out the posttranslational modification of specific glutamate residues in proteins to gamma-carboxy glutamic acid (Gla) in the presence of reduced vitamin K, molecular oxygen, and carbon dioxide. In the process, reduced vitamin K is converted to vitamin K epoxide, which is subsequently reduced to vitamin K, by vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) for use in the carboxylation reaction. The modification has a wide range of physiological implications, including hemostasis, bone calcification, and signal transduction. The enzyme interacts with a high affinity gamma-carboxylation recognition sequence (gamma-CRS) of the substrate and carries out multiple modifications of the substrate before the product is released. This mechanism ensures complete carboxylation of the Gla domain of the coagulation factors, which is essential for their biological activity. gamma-Carboxylation, originally discovered in mammals, is widely distributed in the animal kingdom. It has been characterized in sea squirt (Ciona intestinalis), in flies (Drosophila melanogaster), and in marine snails (Conus textile), none of which have a blood coagulation system similar to mammals. The cone snails express a large array of gamma-carboxylated peptides that modulate the activity of ion channels. These findings have led to the suggestion that gamma-carboxylation is an extracellular posttranslational modification that antedates the divergence of molluscs, arthropods, and chordates. I will first summarize recent understanding of gamma-carboxylase and gamma-carboxylation gleaned from experiments using the mammalian enzyme, and then I will briefly describe the available information on gamma-carboxylation in D. melanogaster and C. textile.",2008,"Pradip K Bandyopadhyay, Pradip K Bandyopadhyay"

We have identified 12-14 candidate SNMP/CD36 homologs from each of the genomes of Drosophila melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti (Diptera), eight candidate homologs from Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera), and 15 from Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera). Analysis (sequence similarity and intron locations) suggests that the insect SNMP/CD36 genes fall into three major groups. Group 1 includes the previously characterized D. melanogaster emp (epithelial membrane protein). Group 2 includes the previously characterized D. melanogaster croquemort, ninaD, santa maria, and peste. Group 3 genes include the SNMPs, which fall into two subgroups referred to as SNMP1 and SNMP2. D. melanogaster SNMP1 (CG7000) shares both significant sequence similarity and five of its six intron insertion sites with the lepidopteran Bombyx mori SNMP1. The topological conservation of this gene family within the three major holometabolous lineages indicates that it predates the coleopteran and hymenoptera/dipera/lepidoptera split 300+ million years ago.

Regulation of the Drosophila hypoxia-inducible factor alpha Sima by CRM1-dependent nuclear export,18332128,10.1128/MCB.01027-07,"Hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) proteins are regulated by oxygen levels through several different mechanisms that include protein stability, transcriptional coactivator recruitment, and subcellular localization. It was previously reported that these transcription factors are mainly nuclear in hypoxia and cytoplasmic in normoxia, but so far the molecular basis of this regulation is unclear. We show here that the Drosophila melanogaster HIF-alpha protein Sima shuttles continuously between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. We identified the relevant nuclear localization signal and two functional nuclear export signals (NESs). These NESs are in the Sima basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain and promote CRM1-dependent nuclear export. Site-directed mutagenesis of either NES provoked Sima nuclear retention and increased transcriptional activity, suggesting that nuclear export contributes to Sima regulation. The identified NESs are conserved and probably functional in the bHLH domains of several bHLH-PAS proteins. We propose that rapid nuclear export of Sima regulates the duration of cellular responses to hypoxia.",2008,"Nuria M Romero, Maximiliano Irisarri, Peggy Roth, Ana Cauerhff, Christos Samakovlis, Pablo Wappner, Nuria M Romero, Maximiliano Irisarri, Peggy Roth, Ana Cauerhff, Christos Samakovlis, Pablo Wappner"
Natural genetic variation in complex mating behaviors of male Drosophila melanogaster,18369720,10.1007/s10519-008-9204-5,"Mating behavior, including courtship and copulation, is a main component of male fitness, especially in species with no parental care. Variation in this behavior can thus be a target for mate choice and sexual selection, and can lead to evolution. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has well-documented complex male courtship comprised of a sequence behaviors, and is an ideal model for behavior-genetic analysis. In order to evaluate genetic differences in the temporal pattern of mating behavior, we developed a high-throughput method that allows us to document the progression of male courtship and copulation using an ordinal scale (male mating progression scale, MMP). Using this method, we document natural genetic variation in the temporal pattern of behavior that was not detected using other metrics. This method was robust enough to detect genetic variation in this trait for males placed with both virgin and mated female targets.",2008,"Elizabeth A Ruedi, Kimberly A Hughes, Elizabeth A Ruedi, Kimberly A Hughes"
Evolutionary origin and genomic organisation of runt-domain containing genes in arthropods,19032778,10.1186/1471-2164-9-558,"Background:
      
    

    
      Gene clusters, such as the Hox gene cluster, are known to have critical roles in development. In eukaryotes gene clusters arise primarily by tandem gene duplication and divergence. Genes within a cluster are often co-regulated, providing selective pressure to maintain the genome organisation, and this co-regulation can result in temporal or spatial co-linearity of gene expression. It has been previously noted that in Drosophila melanogaster, three of the four runt-domain (RD) containing genes are found in a relatively tight cluster on chromosome 1, raising the possibility of a putative functional RD gene cluster in D. melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      To investigate the possibility of such a gene cluster, orthologues of the Drosophila melanogaster RD genes were identified in several endopterygotan insects, two exopterygotan insects and two non-insect arthropods. In all insect species four RD genes were identified and orthology was assigned to the Drosophila sequences by phylogenetic analyses. Although four RD genes were found in the crustacean D. pulex, orthology could not be assigned to the insect sequences, indicating independent gene duplications from a single ancestor following the split of the hexapod lineage from the crustacean lineage.In insects, two chromosomal arrangements of these genes was observed; the first a semi-dispersed cluster, such as in Drosophila, where lozenge is separated from the core cluster of three RD genes often by megabases of DNA. The second arrangement was a tight cluster of the four RD genes, such as in Apis mellifera.This genomic organisation, particularly of the three core RD genes, raises the possibility of shared regulatory elements. In situ hybridisation of embryonic expression of the four RD genes in Drosophila melanogaster and the honeybee A. mellifera shows no evidence for either spatial or temporal co-linearity of expression during embryogenesis.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      All fully sequenced insect genomes contain four RD genes and orthology can be assigned to these genes based on similarity to the D. melanogaster protein sequences. Examination of the genomic organisation of these genes provides evidence for a functional RD gene cluster. RD genes from non-insect arthropods are also clustered, however the lack of orthology between these and insect RD genes suggests this cluster is likely to have resulted from a duplication event independent from that which created the insect RD gene cluster. Analysis of embryonic RD gene expression in two endopterygotan insects, A. mellifera and D. melanogaster, did not show evidence for coordinated gene expression, therefore while the functional significance of this gene cluster remains unknown its maintenance during insect evolution implies some functional significance to the cluster.",2008,"Elizabeth J Duncan, Megan J Wilson, James M Smith, Peter K Dearden, Elizabeth J Duncan, Megan J Wilson, James M Smith, Peter K Dearden"
"A role for Acp29AB, a predicted seminal fluid lectin, in female sperm storage in Drosophila melanogaster",18757944,10.1534/genetics.108.092106,"Females of many animal species store sperm for taxon-specific periods of time, ranging from a few hours to years. Female sperm storage has important reproductive and evolutionary consequences, yet relatively little is known of its molecular basis. Here, we report the isolation of a loss-of-function mutation of the Drosophila melanogaster Acp29AB gene, which encodes a seminal fluid protein that is transferred from males to females during mating. Using this mutant, we show that Acp29AB is required for the normal maintenance of sperm in storage. Consistent with this role, Acp29AB localizes to female sperm storage organs following mating, although it does not appear to associate tightly with sperm. Acp29AB is a predicted lectin, suggesting that sugar-protein interactions may be important for D. melanogaster sperm storage, much as they are in many mammals. Previous association studies have found an effect of Acp29AB genotype on a male's sperm competitive ability; our findings suggest that effects on sperm storage may underlie these differences in sperm competition. Moreover, Acp29AB's effects on sperm storage and sperm competition may explain previously documented evidence for positive selection on the Acp29AB locus.",2008,"Alex Wong, Shannon N Albright, Jonathan D Giebel, K Ravi Ram, Shuqing Ji, Anthony C Fiumera, Mariana F Wolfner, Alex Wong, Shannon N Albright, Jonathan D Giebel, K Ravi Ram, Shuqing Ji, Anthony C Fiumera, Mariana F Wolfner"
Genotype-by-environment interactions and adaptation to local temperature affect immunity and fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster,18369474,10.1371/journal.ppat.1000025,"Natural populations of most organisms harbor substantial genetic variation for resistance to infection. The continued existence of such variation is unexpected under simple evolutionary models that either posit direct and continuous natural selection on the immune system or an evolved life history ""balance"" between immunity and other fitness traits in a constant environment. However, both local adaptation to heterogeneous environments and genotype-by-environment interactions can maintain genetic variation in a species. In this study, we test Drosophila melanogaster genotypes sampled from tropical Africa, temperate northeastern North America, and semi-tropical southeastern North America for resistance to bacterial infection and fecundity at three different environmental temperatures. Environmental temperature had absolute effects on all traits, but there were also marked genotype-by-environment interactions that may limit the global efficiency of natural selection on both traits. African flies performed more poorly than North American flies in both immunity and fecundity at the lowest temperature, but not at the higher temperatures, suggesting that the African population is maladapted to low temperature. In contrast, there was no evidence for clinal variation driven by thermal adaptation within North America for either trait. Resistance to infection and reproductive success were generally uncorrelated across genotypes, so this study finds no evidence for a fitness tradeoff between immunity and fecundity under the conditions tested. Both local adaptation to geographically heterogeneous environments and genotype-by-environment interactions may explain the persistence of genetic variation for resistance to infection in natural populations.",2008,"Brian P Lazzaro, Heather A Flores, James G Lorigan, Christopher P Yourth, Brian P Lazzaro, Heather A Flores, James G Lorigan, Christopher P Yourth"
Performance trade-offs in the flight initiation of Drosophila,18203989,10.1242/jeb.012682,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster performs at least two distinct types of flight initiation. One kind is a stereotyped escape response to a visual stimulus that is mediated by the hard-wired giant fiber neural pathway, and the other is a more variable ;voluntary' response that can be performed without giant fiber activation. Because the simpler escape take-offs are apparently successful, it is unclear why the fly has multiple pathways to coordinate flight initiation. In this study we use high-speed videography to observe flight initiation in unrestrained wild-type flies and assess the flight performance of each of the two types of take-off. Three-dimensional kinematic analysis of take-off sequences indicates that wing use during the jumping phase of flight initiation is essential for stabilizing flight. During voluntary take-offs, early wing elevation leads to a slower and more stable take-off. In contrast, during visually elicited escapes, the wings are pulled down close to the body during take-off, resulting in tumbling flights in which the fly translates faster but also rotates rapidly about all three of its body axes. Additionally, we find evidence that the power delivered by the legs is substantially greater during visually elicited escapes than during voluntary take-offs. Thus, we find that the two types of Drosophila flight initiation result in different flight performances once the fly is airborne, and that these performances are distinguished by a trade-off between speed and stability.",2008,"Gwyneth Card, Michael Dickinson, Gwyneth Card, Michael Dickinson"
"Alternative relay domains of Drosophila melanogaster myosin differentially affect ATPase activity, in vitro motility, myofibril structure and muscle function",18462751,10.1016/j.jmb.2008.04.010,"The relay domain of myosin is hypothesized to function as a communication pathway between the nucleotide-binding site, actin-binding site and the converter domain. In Drosophila melanogaster, a single myosin heavy chain gene encodes three alternative relay domains. Exon 9a encodes the indirect flight muscle isoform (IFI) relay domain, whereas exon 9b encodes one of the embryonic body wall isoform (EMB) relay domains. To gain a better understanding of the function of the relay domain and the differences imparted by the IFI and the EMB versions, we constructed two transgenic Drosophila lines expressing chimeric myosin heavy chains in indirect flight muscles lacking endogenous myosin. One expresses the IFI relay domain in the EMB backbone (EMB-9a), while the second expresses the EMB relay domain in the IFI backbone (IFI-9b). Our studies reveal that the EMB relay domain is functionally equivalent to the IFI relay domain when it is substituted into IFI. Essentially no differences in ATPase activity, actin-sliding velocity, flight ability at room temperature or muscle structure are observed in IFI-9b compared to native IFI. However, when the EMB relay domain is replaced with the IFI relay domain, we find a 50% reduction in actin-activated ATPase activity, a significant increase in actin affinity, abolition of actin sliding, defects in myofibril assembly and rapid degeneration of muscle structure compared to EMB. We hypothesize that altered relay domain conformational changes in EMB-9a impair intramolecular communication with the EMB-specific converter domain. This decreases transition rates involving strongly bound actomyosin states, leading to a reduced ATPase rate and loss of actin motility.",2008,"William A Kronert, Corey M Dambacher, Aileen F Knowles, Douglas M Swank, Sanford I Bernstein, William A Kronert, Corey M Dambacher, Aileen F Knowles, Douglas M Swank, Sanford I Bernstein"

During this period we sampled flies every 6h and measured their ability to survive heat and cold shock. There was a significant positive correlation between field temperature and heat shock survival and a significant negative correlation between field temperature and cold shock survival indicating that D. melanogaster are constantly adapting to their surrounding environment.

Casein kinase I epsilon does not rescue double-time function in Drosophila despite evolutionarily conserved roles in the circadian clock,18258753,10.1177/0748730407311652,"Double-time (dbt) is a casein kinase gene involved in cell survival, proliferation, and circadian rhythms in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that dbt and its mammalian ortholog casein kinase I epsilon (hckI epsilon) regulate the circadian phosphorylation of period (per), thus controlling per subcellular localization and stability. Mutations in these kinases can shorten the circadian period in both mammals and Drosophila. Since similar activities in circadian clock have been described for these kinases, we investigated whether the expression of mammalian casein kinase I can replace the activity of dbt in flies. Global expression of the full-length dbt rescued lethality of the null mutant dbt revVIII and rescued flies showed normal locomotor activity rhythms. Global expression of dbt also restored the locomotor activity rhythm of the arrhythmic genotype, dbt ar/dbt revVIII. In contrast, global expression of hckI epsilon or hckI alpha did not rescue lethality or locomotor activity of dbt mutants. Furthermore dbt overexpression in wild-type clock cells had only a small effect on period length, whereas hckI epsilon expression in clock cells greatly lengthened period to ~30.5 hours and increased the number of arrhythmic flies. These results indicate that hckI epsilon cannot replace the activity of dbt in flies despite the high degree of similarity in primary sequence and kinase function. Moreover, expression of hck Iepsilon in flies appears to interfere with dbt activity. Thus, caution should be used in interpreting assays that measure activity of mammalian casein kinase mutants in Drosophila, or that employ vertebrate CKI in studies of dPER phosphorylations.",2008,"Tatsumori Sekine, Terumi Yamaguchi, Kunikatsu Hamano, Michael W Young, Masami Shimoda, Lino Saez, Tatsumori Sekine, Terumi Yamaguchi, Kunikatsu Hamano, Michael W Young, Masami Shimoda, Lino Saez"
Joint effects of density dependence and toxicant exposure on Drosophila melanogaster populations,17658601,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2007.05.020,"Risk assessment of environmental contaminants is usually based on experiments on well-fed individuals held at low population densities. However, field populations are often subject to resource limitation. Individuals who are already stressed by crowding or food limitation may show greater susceptibility to toxicants. But density dependence could also reduce population-level impacts as toxicant-related mortalities may reduce competition for resources. This study examines the joint effects of toxicants and food availability on populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The interactions between the effects of food limitation and toxicant stress were dose dependent and strongly influenced by toxicity mechanisms. In food-limited conditions, a compensatory effect often occurred, with toxicant exposure having a lower proportional impact than at higher food levels. This provides further evidence that density-dependent population processes can produce an assimilative capacity for the effects of toxicants. But synergistic food-toxicant effects were also common and the interaction often switched between synergistic and compensatory at different toxicant concentrations and food supplies. There is no simple ""less-than-additive"", ""additive"" or ""more-than-additive"" relationship between density and toxicant effects, even for a single toxicant.",2008,"Yue Gui, Alastair Grant, Yue Gui, Alastair Grant"

At the end of larval development, it is known that 20E--signaling through a nuclear receptor heterodimer consisting of EcR and USP--induces the early and late puffing cascade of the polytene chromosomes and causes the exocytosis of stored glue granules into the lumen of the gland. It has also been reported that an earlier pulse of hormone induces the temporally and spatially specific transcriptional activation of the glue genes; however, the receptor responsible for triggering this response has not been characterized. Here we show that the coordinated expression of the glue genes midway through the third instar is mediated by 20E acting to induce genes of the Broad Complex (BRC) through a receptor that is not an EcR/USP heterodimer.

This chapter describes protocols for detecting apoptotic cells during Drosophila development, as well as the use of Drosophila cell lines. Commonly used methods for detecting apoptosis are described, including TUNEL, acridine orange, and immunostaining with specific components of the apoptotic pathway such as active caspases. A crucial step in the induction of apoptosis is caspase activation and cleavage, which can be measured by use of fluorogenic peptide substrates or detection of cleaved protein products by immunoblotting, respectively.

We propose that seminal fluid proteases are likely targets of selection due to their demonstrated or potential roles in between-sex interactions and immune processes. We use within- and between-species sequence data for 5 predicted protease-encoding Acp loci to test this hypothesis. Our polymorphism-based analyses find evidence for positive selection at 2 genes, both of which encode predicted serine protease homologs. One of these genes, CG6069, also shows evidence for consistent selection on a subset of codons over a deeper evolutionary time scale.

Ingested double-stranded RNAs can act as species-specific insecticides,19815067,10.1016/j.ibmb.2009.09.007,"A serious shortcoming of many insecticides is that they can kill non-target species. To address this issue, we harnessed the sequence specificity of RNA interference (RNAi) to design orally-delivered double-stranded (ds) RNAs that selectively killed target species. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum), pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum), and tobacco hornworms (Manduca sexta) were selectively killed when fed species-specific dsRNA targeting vATPase transcripts. We also demonstrate that even closely related species can be selectively killed by feeding on dsRNAs that target the more variable regions of genes, such as the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs): four species of the genus Drosophila were selectively killed by feeding on short (<40 nt) dsRNAs that targeted the 3' UTR of the gamma-tubulin gene. For the aphid nymphs and beetle and moth larvae, dsRNA could simply be dissolved into their diets, but to induce RNAi in the drosophilid species, the dsRNAs needed to be encapsulated in liposomes to help facilitate uptake of the dsRNA.

We identify the metazoan-specific NMD factor SMG6 as the responsible endonuclease by demonstrating that mutation of conserved residues in its nuclease domain--the C-terminal PIN motif--abolishes endonucleolysis in vivo and in vitro.

Electronic structure of (6-4) DNA photoproduct repair involving a non-oxetane pathway,19921821,10.1021/ja904550d,"Mutagenic pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts are one of the main DNA lesions induced by solar UV radiation. These lesions can be photoreversed by (6-4) photolyases. The originally published repair mechanism involves rearrangement of the lesion into an oxetane intermediate upon binding to the (6-4) photolyase, followed by light-induced electron transfer from the reduced flavin cofactor. In a recent crystallographic study on a (6-4) photoproduct complexed with (6-4) photolyase from Drosophila melanogaster no oxetane was observed, raising the possibility of a non-oxetane repair mechanism. Using quantum-chemical calculations we find that in addition to repair via an oxetane, a direct transfer of the hydroxyl group results in reversal of the radical anion (6-4) photoproduct. In both mechanisms, the transition states have high energies and correspond to avoided crossings of the ground and excited electronic states. To study whether the repair can proceed via these state crossings, the excited-state potential energy curves were computed. The radical excitation energies and accessibility of the nonadiabatic repair path were found to depend on hydrogen bonds and the protonation state of the lesion. On the basis of the energy calculations, a nonadiabatic repair of the excited (6-4) lesion radical anion via hydroxyl transfer is probable. This repair mechanism is in line with the recent structural data on the (6-4) photolyase from D. melanogaster .",2009,"Tatiana Domratcheva, Ilme Schlichting, Tatiana Domratcheva, Ilme Schlichting"

Quantifying adaptive evolution in the Drosophila immune system,19851448,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000698,"It is estimated that a large proportion of amino acid substitutions in Drosophila have been fixed by natural selection, and as organisms are faced with an ever-changing array of pathogens and parasites to which they must adapt, we have investigated the role of parasite-mediated selection as a likely cause. To quantify the effect, and to identify which genes and pathways are most likely to be involved in the host-parasite arms race, we have re-sequenced population samples of 136 immunity and 287 position-matched non-immunity genes in two species of Drosophila. Using these data, and a new extension of the McDonald-Kreitman approach, we estimate that natural selection fixes advantageous amino acid changes in immunity genes at nearly double the rate of other genes. We find the rate of adaptive evolution in immunity genes is also more variable than other genes, with a small subset of immune genes evolving under intense selection. These genes, which are likely to represent hotspots of host-parasite coevolution, tend to share similar functions or belong to the same pathways, such as the antiviral RNAi pathway and the IMD signalling pathway. These patterns appear to be general features of immune system evolution in both species, as rates of adaptive evolution are correlated between the D. melanogaster and D. simulans lineages. In summary, our data provide quantitative estimates of the elevated rate of adaptive evolution in immune system genes relative to the rest of the genome, and they suggest that adaptation to parasites is an important force driving molecular evolution.",2009,"Darren J Obbard, John J Welch, Kang-Wook Kim, Francis M Jiggins, Darren J Obbard, John J Welch, Kang-Wook Kim, Francis M Jiggins"
The Drosophila melanogaster Gene cg4930 Encodes a High Affinity Inhibitor for Endonuclease G,19129189,10.1074/jbc.M808319200,"Endonuclease G (EndoG) is a mitochondrial enzyme believed to be released during apoptosis to participate in the degradation of nuclear DNA. This paper describes a Drosophila protein, EndoGI, which inhibits EndoG specifically. EndoG and EndoGI associate with subpicomolar affinity, forming a 2:1 complex in which dimeric EndoG is bound by two tandemly repeated homologous domains of monomeric EndoGI. Binding appears to involve the active site of EndoG. EndoGI is present in the cell nucleus at micromolar concentrations. Upon induction of apoptosis, levels of the inhibitor appear to be reduced, and it is relocalized to the cytoplasm. EndoGI, encoded by the predicted open reading frame cg4930, is expressed throughout Drosophila development. Flies homozygous for a hypomorphic EndoGI mutation have a strongly reduced viability, which is modulated by genetic background and diet. We propose that EndoGI protects the cell against low levels of EndoG outside mitochondria.",2009,"Claudia Temme, Rebekka Weissbach, Hauke Lilie, Clive Wilson, Anton Meinhart, Sylke Meyer, Ralph Golbik, Angelika Schierhorn, Elmar Wahle, Claudia Temme, Rebekka Weissbach, Hauke Lilie, Clive Wilson, Anton Meinhart, Sylke Meyer, Ralph Golbik, Angelika Schierhorn, Elmar Wahle"
RNAi in Drosophila S2 cells as a tool for studying cell cycle progression,19475381,10.1007/978-1-60327-993-2_3,"Genetic studies on model organisms, particularly yeasts and Drosophila melanogaster, have proven powerful in identifying the cell cycle machinery and its regulatory mechanisms. In more recent years RNAi has been used in a variety of genome-wide screens and single molecule studies to elucidate the mechanisms of cell cycle progression. In Drosophila cultured cells, RNAi is extremely simple, and a strong effect can be observed by adding the dsRNA to the cultured cells, with few complications of off-target effects. Functions in cell cycle progression can be followed by a variety of assays. One of the advantages of these cells is that they allow high-resolution spatiotemporal observations to be made by microscopy, with no particular complexity in terms of media and temperature.

Non-genic transcription at the Drosophila bithorax complex functional activity of the dark matter of the genome,19247967,10.1387/ijdb.082647mh,"Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model system for the study of gene regulation due to its short generation time, high fertility and the availability of various genetic tools to manipulate the genome. Investigation into the regulation of homeotic genes and their role in embryonic patterning during development was pioneered in Drosophila. Recently, the molecular mechanisms responsible for regulating gene expression in the bithorax complex have been the focus of active study. Many of these studies have pointed to the importance of cis-regulatory modules, genetic sequences that direct the temporal and spatial patterns of gene expression over large genomic distances. Additional components of the regulatory code have emerged beyond the primary DNA sequence. In particular, non-genic transcription is an important mechanism for controlling gene expression either through direct transcriptional mechanisms that mediate dynamic epigenetic control of the chromatin environment or through functional activity of the RNA products.",2009,"Margaret C W Ho, Benjamin J Schiller, Sara E Goetz, Robert A Drewell, Margaret C W Ho, Benjamin J Schiller, Sara E Goetz, Robert A Drewell"
Nuclear receptors homo sapiens Rev-erbbeta and Drosophila melanogaster E75 are thiolate-ligated heme proteins which undergo redox-mediated ligand switching and bind CO and NO,19405475,10.1021/bi900697c,"Nuclear receptors E75, which regulates development in Drosophila melanogaster, and Rev-erbbeta, which regulates circadian rhythm in humans, bind heme within their ligand binding domains (LBD). The heme-bound ligand binding domains of E75 and Rev-erbbeta were studied using electronic absorption, MCD, resonance Raman, and EPR spectroscopies. Both proteins undergo redox-dependent ligand switching and CO- and NO-induced ligand displacement. In the Fe(III) oxidation state, the nuclear receptor hemes are low spin and 6-coordinate with cysteine(thiolate) as one of the two axial heme ligands. The sixth ligand is a neutral donor, presumably histidine. When the heme is reduced to the Fe(II) oxidation state, the cysteine(thiolate) is replaced by a different neutral donor ligand, whose identity is not known. CO binds to the Fe(II) heme in both E75(LBD) and Rev-erbbeta(LBD) opposite a sixth neutral ligand, plausibly the same histidine that served as the sixth ligand in the Fe(III) state. NO binds to the heme of both proteins; however, the NO-heme is 5-coordinate in E75 and 6-coordinate in Rev-erbbeta. These nuclear receptors exhibit coordination characteristics that are similar to other known redox and gas sensors, suggesting that E75 and Rev-erbbeta may function in heme-, redox-, or gas-regulated control of cellular function.",2009,"Katherine A Marvin, Jeffrey L Reinking, Andrea J Lee, Keith Pardee, Henry M Krause, Judith N Burstyn, Katherine A Marvin, Jeffrey L Reinking, Andrea J Lee, Keith Pardee, Henry M Krause, Judith N Burstyn"
The recent origin of the Sdic gene cluster in the melanogaster subgroup,18587654,10.1007/s10709-008-9288-0,"Gene families are composed of closely related genes and are an important part of eukaryotic genomes. In the proximal region of the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster there is a cluster of four tandem Sdic genes, located between the gene Cdic and the gene AnnX. Sdic is a chimeric gene that encodes a novel protein with sperm-specific expression. It had been hypothesized that the Sdic gene cluster was formed after the split of D. melanogaster and D. simulans. To study the evolution of this cluster, the sequence of this region was studied in several Drosophilidae species. In all species analyzed, Sdic genes are absent and AnnX and Cdic are adjacent to each other. The results allowed the inference of the ancestral situation and the reconstruction of the evolution of the cluster, and confirm that the Sdic cluster was indeed formed in the lineage that gave rise to D. melanogaster, being one of the youngest gene clusters known.",2009,"Rita Ponce, Rita Ponce"
[Analysis of the structure and expression of the DIP1 gene in Drosophila melanogaster strains mutant for the flamenco gene],19334614,,"DIP1 gene transcription was analyzed with the use of RT-PCR in three Drosophila melanogaster strains with the flamenco- phenotype (flam(SS), flam(MS), and flam(Ore)) and in one flamenco+ strain at the stages of embryos (0-24 h), third-instar larvae, and adult flies. The mutant strains flam(SS) and flam(Ore) lack an active copy of transposon gypsy. Theflam(MS) strain was obtained by introducing an active copy of gypsy in flies of theflam(SS) strain and is characterized by a high rate of gypsy transpositions. The experiments showed that at least five forms of DIP1 gene transcripts are produced. The form of cDNA corresponding to CDS DIP1-d was discovered only in embryos. It was found that DIP1 gene transcription depends on the age of flies: at the larval stage the level of transcription is significantly reduced. However, no reduction of gene transcription is observed in theflam(Ore) strain. These results suggest that the flamenco- phenotype may be associated with an alteration of DIP1 gene transcription, as in differentflamenco- strains the DIP1 gene expression is changed differently.",2009,"L N Nefedova, M V Potanova, N I Romanova, A I Kim, L N Nefedova, M V Potanova, N I Romanova, A I Kim"

By taking advantage of existing P-insertion alleles of the D1 gene, I generated D1 null mutations to investigate the phenotypic effect of loss of the D1 gene. In contrast to a previous report, I determined that the D1 gene is not essential for viability of Drosophila melanogaster, and moreover, that loss of D1 has no obvious phenotypic effects. My tests for an effect of D1 mutations on PEV revealed that it is not a suppressor of variegation, as concluded by other investigators. In fact, the consequence of loss of D1 on one of six variegating rearrangements tested, T(2;3)Sb(V), was dominant enhancement of PEV, suggesting a role for the protein in euchromatic chromatin structure and/or transcription.

Wing and body motion during flight initiation in Drosophila revealed by automated visual tracking,19376952,10.1242/jeb.025379,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a widely used model organism in studies of genetics, developmental biology and biomechanics. One limitation for exploiting Drosophila as a model system for behavioral neurobiology is that measuring body kinematics during behavior is labor intensive and subjective. In order to quantify flight kinematics during different types of maneuvers, we have developed a visual tracking system that estimates the posture of the fly from multiple calibrated cameras. An accurate geometric fly model is designed using unit quaternions to capture complex body and wing rotations, which are automatically fitted to the images in each time frame. Our approach works across a range of flight behaviors, while also being robust to common environmental clutter. The tracking system is used in this paper to compare wing and body motion during both voluntary and escape take-offs. Using our automated algorithms, we are able to measure stroke amplitude, geometric angle of attack and other parameters important to a mechanistic understanding of flapping flight. When compared with manual tracking methods, the algorithm estimates body position within 4.4+/-1.3% of the body length, while body orientation is measured within 6.5+/-1.9 deg. (roll), 3.2+/-1.3 deg. (pitch) and 3.4+/-1.6 deg. (yaw) on average across six videos. Similarly, stroke amplitude and deviation are estimated within 3.3 deg. and 2.1 deg., while angle of attack is typically measured within 8.8 deg. comparing against a human digitizer. Using our automated tracker, we analyzed a total of eight voluntary and two escape take-offs. These sequences show that Drosophila melanogaster do not utilize clap and fling during take-off and are able to modify their wing kinematics from one wingstroke to the next. Our approach should enable biomechanists and ethologists to process much larger datasets than possible at present and, therefore, accelerate insight into the mechanisms of free-flight maneuvers of flying insects.",2009,"Ebraheem I Fontaine, Francisco Zabala, Michael H Dickinson, Joel W Burdick, Ebraheem I Fontaine, Francisco Zabala, Michael H Dickinson, Joel W Burdick"

In this work, we aim to identify novel genes regulating wing growth and patterning. To this end, we have carried out a gain-of-function screen generating novel P-UAS (upstream activating sequences) insertions allowing forced gene expression.

To analyze the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of AhR, we used chimeras between mouse and Drosophila AhR. The chimeric AhR revealed that the LBD determines constitutive transactivation in Drosophila AhR or ligand-dependent activation in mouse AhR. The LBD was further divided into three blocks that corresponded to amino acids 230-300, 301-361, and 361-420 of the mouse sequence. Six chimeric proteins clarified that amino acids 291-350 of the Drosophila LBD, i.e. the middle region, were required to keep the protein in the active form in the absence of ligand binding, whereas in the mouse AhR, this region was required to maintain the protein in the inactive form in the absence of ligand.

        Results:
      
    

    
      To support research on Drosophila melanogaster transcription regulation and make the genome wide in vivo protein-DNA interactions data available to the scientific community as a whole, we have developed a system called Flynet. Currently, Flynet contains 101 datasets for 38 transcription factors and chromatin regulator proteins in different experimental conditions. These factors exhibit different types of binding profiles ranging from sharp localized peaks to broad binding regions. The protein-DNA interaction data in Flynet was obtained from the analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments on one color and two color genomic tiling arrays as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing. A web-based interface, integrated with an AJAX based genome browser, has been built for queries and presenting analysis results. Flynet also makes available the cis-regulatory modules reported in literature, known and de novo identified sequence motifs across the genome, and other resources to study gene regulation.

Domains of heterochromatin protein 1 required for Drosophila melanogaster heterochromatin spreading,19487560,10.1534/genetics.109.105338,"Centric regions of eukaryotic genomes are packaged into heterochromatin, which possesses the ability to spread along the chromosome and silence gene expression. The process of spreading has been challenging to study at the molecular level due to repetitious sequences within centric regions. A heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) tethering system was developed that generates ""ectopic heterochromatin"" at sites within euchromatic regions of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Using this system, we show that HP1 dimerization and the PxVxL interaction platform formed by dimerization of the HP1 chromo shadow domain are necessary for spreading to a downstream reporter gene located 3.7 kb away. Surprisingly, either the HP1 chromo domain or the chromo shadow domain alone is sufficient for spreading and silencing at a downstream reporter gene located 1.9 kb away. Spreading is dependent on at least two H3K9 methyltransferases, with SU(VAR)3-9 playing a greater role at the 3.7-kb reporter and dSETDB1 predominately acting at the 1.9 kb reporter.

We show Fwd is required for synthesis of PI 4-phosphate (PI4P) on Golgi membranes and for formation of PI4P-containing secretory organelles that localize to the midzone. Fwd binds and colocalizes with Rab11 on Golgi membranes, and is required for localization of Rab11 in dividing cells.

Molecular analysis of evolutionary changes in the expression of Drosophila esterases,1700427,10.1073/pnas.87.21.8217,"Drosophila melanogaster transformed with the esterase 5 (Est-5) gene from Drosophila pseudoobscura were used to assess the evolutionary basis for differences in the sex- and tissue-specific expression of the esterase 5 (EST 5) enzyme in D. pseudoobscura relative to its homologue in D. melanogaster, EST 6. EST 5 is expressed in the eyes and hemolymph of transformed D. melanogaster just as it is in D. pseudoobscura, but it is not detectable in the ejaculatory duct, where the homologous enzyme, EST 6, is most abundant. EST 5 also occurs at equal levels in both sexes of the transformants and D. pseudoobscura, whereas EST 6 is more abundant in male than in female D. melanogaster. Northern analysis of transformed and untransformed flies indicates that the expression patterns of EST 5 and EST 6 are controlled at the level of transcription and suggests that regulatory differences between Est-6 and Est-5 have evolved mainly through cis-acting regulatory changes in the two loci rather than through alterations in trans-acting factors. Equal expression of EST 5 in male and female transformants also indicates that the X-chromosome-linked Est-5 gene of D. pseudoobscura, when isolated as a 4.5-kilobase restriction fragment, is not dosage compensated after integration into an autosome of D. melanogaster.",1990,"J P Brady, R C Richmond"

"Two novel annexins from Drosophila melanogaster. Cloning, characterization, and differential expression in development",2141610,,"The annexins are a family of homologous Ca2(+)- and phospholipid-binding proteins that until now have only been found in vertebrates. cDNA clones encoding two novel annexins from Drosophila melanogaster were isolated and characterized. RNA blots indicate that the messages for the two Drosophila proteins are differentially expressed in development, with one message being expressed throughout development, while the other is only found in early embryos and adult flies. In situ hybridizations localize the two Drosophila genes to 93B and 19A-4,7. A similarly high degree of homology relates Drosophila annexins to different vertebrate annexins, indicating that the Drosophila annexins are not the invertebrate homologues of particular mammalian annexins but that they constitute novel members of the annexin gene family. In continuation with a recently established terminology, the Drosophila annexins will be named annexins IX and X. The biochemical properties of Drosophila annexin X were investigated using recombinant protein. Similar to vertebrate annexins, annexin X bound to liver membranes and liposomes containing phosphatidylserine in a calcium-dependent manner but not to liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine. In addition, annexin X partitioned into the detergent phase of Triton X-114 as a function of calcium. The conservation of the annexin family of Ca2(+)-binding proteins in invertebrates suggests that they have a basic function in cells which is not peculiar to vertebrate biology, and the availability of the Drosophila sequences will open avenues for mutational studies of these functions.",1990,"P A Johnston, M S Perin, G A Reynolds, S A Wasserman, T C SÃ¼dhof, P A Johnston, M S Perin, G A Reynolds, S A Wasserman, T C SÃ¼dhof"
Effects of the apterous4 mutation on Drosophila melanogaster males' courtship,2121922,10.3109/01677069009107112,"The apterous4 (ap4) mutation has pleiotropic effects on the morphology and lifespan of D. melanogaster adults. The mutation also affects one aspect of male sexual behaviour. Unlike normal, sexually mature males, three day old ap4/ap4 males synthesize courtship-stimulating hydrocarbons that immature males make; as a result they elicit vigorous courtship (Jallon and Hotta, 1979; Jallon et al., 1986). Data presented in this report indicate that expression of the apterous4 mutation does not affect all aspects of sexual maturation in males. Specifically, 24-30 hour old ap4/ap4 males are capable of performing all of the courtship behaviors, including abdominal vibration, a newly described response of mutant and wild-type males to virgin females. However, the mutant males spend less time courting and are less likely to perform some of the courtship behaviours than age-matched controls. These abnormalities are probably indirect effects of the apterous4 allele's previously unreported effects on the flies' motor functions, which include partial paralysis, lack of coordination, and sluggishness.",1990,"L Tompkins, L Tompkins"
The segregation distortion (SD) phenomenon in wild populations of Drosophila melanogaster: interaction between chromosomes 3 and SD chromosomes 2,2124572,10.1007/BF00226445,"The Segregation Distortion (SD) phenomenon is a typical case of non-Mendelian segregation in Drosophila melanogaster, due to the dysfunction of sperm bearing a non-SD homologous chromosome. In nature, several factors involved in the expression of the SD phenomenon have been described; among these, a genetic modifier carried by chromosome 3, which enhances the distortion effect of the SD chromosomes. The analysis of natural Sardinian populations, carried out in order to evaluate the presence of chromosome 3 bearing these enhancer factors, has enabled us to ascertain that (a) also in these populations chromosomes 3 with enhancer factors are present, although with frequencies lower than those previously reported in other publications; (b) among these enhancer chromosomes 3, some increase the k of certain chromosomes 2 from values of chromosomes considered non-distorting (k less than or equal to 0.66) to value typical of SD chromosomes.

Molecular characteristics of the heterochromatic I elements from a reactive strain of Drosophila melanogaster,2175814,10.1007/BF02106056,"There are two categories of strains in Drosophila melanogaster with respect to the I-R system of hybrid dysgenesis.

Defective I elements are present in the pericentromeric regions of both categories of strains. This last subfamily of I sequences has not yet been described in detail and little is known about its origin. In this paper, we report that the defective I elements display an average of 94% of sequence identity with each other and with the transposable I factor. The results suggest that they cannot be the progenitors of the present day I factors, but that each of these two subfamilies started to evolve independently several million years ago.

Transcriptional analyses of the uncoordinated region of Drosophila melanogaster,1707845,10.1139/g90-125,"RNA blotting experiments reveal that a genomic region encompassing the uncoordinated complementation group of Drosophila melanogaster produces two classes of transcripts.

Transcripts of the first class are found predominantly in the early larval, pupal, and adult life stages, whereas the 7.3-kb species is present throughout the life cycle and is also found in the heads of adult flies. The two classes of RNAs derive from different combinations of exons.

Parasitoid virus-like particles destroy Drosophila cellular immunity,2122461,10.1073/pnas.87.21.8388,"Parasitoid wasps must avoid the destructive effects of the host's cellular defense system in order to exploit the host hemocoel as a suitable environment for their survival. To protect their eggs from encapsulation by Drosophila melanogaster blood cells, Leptopilina heterotoma females inject a factor that selectively destroys lamellocytes, the type of Drosophila blood cell involved in recognition and encapsulation of large foreign objects. Other types of host blood cells, including the phagocytic plasmatocytes, remain functional. This report demonstrates that the destructive factor for lamellocytes is a virus-like particle (VLP) stored in the reservoir of an accessory gland associated with the female wasp reproductive system. We show that VLPs enter Drosophila blood cells in vitro. VLPs are found free in the cytoplasm of lamellocytes but are confined to phagocytic vesicles of plasmatocytes. As lamellocytes are susceptible to the VLP infection and plasmatocytes are not, we conclude that the mode of VLP entry and its disposition in the cytoplasm determine the fate of the infected host blood cell.",1990,"R M Rizki, T M Rizki, R M Rizki, T M Rizki"

Purification and characterization of DNA ligase II from Drosophila melanogaster,2120058,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1990.tb19284.x,"Drosophila melanogaster contains DNA ligases I and II.

Although the activity of DNA ligase II is low, it persists throughout all developmental stages. The specific activity of DNA ligase II is high in embryos, but the total activity per body mass was highest in pupae. To characterize the properties of DNA ligase II further and to clarify its differences from DNA ligase I, DNA ligase II was prepared from pupae of D. melanogaster. The enzyme was purified about 3200-fold by ammonium sulfate fractionation (40-70% saturation), phosphocellulose (P11) and Ultrogel column chromatography. Some of the properties have been reported previously. The isoelectric point of DNA ligase II was 6.4 while those of DNA ligase I were 4.9 and 5.8. The optimum pH of DNA ligase II was 7.8-8.1 but 8.0-8.5 for DNA ligase I. The molecular masses of DNA ligase II adducts with AMP were determined as 90 and 70 kDa. These adducts were degraded to 42 and 14.4 kDa by trypsin digestion. For preparation of monoclonal antibodies, a mouse was immunized with the purified enzyme. Two clones, 10-6 and 3-3 IgM, were obtained and purified from mouse ascites. These antibodies showed both binding and neutralizing activities toward DNA ligase II from D. melanogaster, but did not react with DNA ligase I from the same origin.

"Diverse expression of dsrc29A, a gene related to src, during the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster",2129225,,"We used in situ hybridization to study the RNA expression of the dsrc29A gene during Drosophila development. This gene encodes two proteins differing at their amino termini. Both gene products contain a protein-tyrosine kinase domain and resemble the protein encoded by vertebrate src. We examined most stages of development in the Drosophila life cycle: embryos, third instar larvae, pupae and adults. Our results revealed that dsrc29A expression is specialized throughout development, being prominent at various times in neural tissue, phagocytic cells, dorsal vessel, ovaries, gut, developing salivary glands, imaginal discs and disc derivatives. These findings confirm and extend previous results for the distribution of dsrc29A protein, indicating that the regulation of this gene is primarily at the level of transcription. In some tissues expression is transient, whereas in others, it is continuous, and expression occurs in proliferative, differentiating and differentiated tissue. These patterns of expression demonstrate how a single protein-tyrosine kinase might play diverse roles at different times during development. Comparison of the expression of dsrc29A and other members of the protein-tyrosine kinase gene superfamily reveals that the genes are expressed in distinctive but sometimes overlapping patterns.",1990,"A L Katzen, T Kornberg, J M Bishop, A L Katzen, T Kornberg, J M Bishop"

Neural architecture of the primary gustatory center of Drosophila melanogaster visualized with GAL4 and LexA enhancer-trap systems,20878781,10.1002/cne.22433,"Gustatory information is essential for animals to select edible foods and avoid poisons. Whereas mammals detect tastants with their taste receptor cells, which convey gustatory signals to the brain indirectly via the taste sensory neurons, insect gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) send their axons directly to the primary gustatory center in the suboesophageal ganglion (SOG). In spite of this relatively simple architecture, the precise structure of the insect primary gustatory center has not been revealed in enough detail. To obtain comprehensive anatomical knowledge about this brain area, we screened the Drosophila melanogaster GAL4 enhancer-trap strains that visualize specific subsets of the gustatory neurons as well as putative mechanosensory neurons associated with the taste pegs. Terminals of these neurons form three branches in the SOG. To map the positions of their arborization areas precisely, we screened newly established LexA::VP16 enhancer-trap strains and obtained a driver line that labels a large subset of peripheral sensory neurons. By double-labeling specific and landmark neurons with GAL4 and LexA strains, we were able to distinguish 11 zones in the primary gustatory center, among which 5 zones were identified newly in this study. Arborization areas of various known GRNs on the labellum, oesophagus, and legs were also mapped in this framework. The putative mechanosensory neurons terminate exclusively in three zones of these areas, supporting the notion of segregated primary centers that are specialized for chemosensory and mechanosensory signals associated with gustatory sensation.",2010,"Takaaki Miyazaki, Kei Ito, Takaaki Miyazaki, Kei Ito"
Phylogeny disambiguates the evolution of heat-shock cis-regulatory elements in Drosophila,20498853,10.1371/journal.pone.0010669,"Heat-shock genes have a well-studied control mechanism for their expression that is mediated through cis-regulatory motifs known as heat-shock elements (HSEs). The evolution of important features of this control mechanism has not been investigated in detail, however. Here we exploit the genome sequencing of multiple Drosophila species, combined with a wealth of available information on the structure and function of HSEs in D. melanogaster, to undertake this investigation. We find that in single-copy heat shock genes, entire HSEs have evolved or disappeared 14 times, and the phylogenetic approach bounds the timing and direction of these evolutionary events in relation to speciation. In contrast, in the multi-copy gene Hsp70, the number of HSEs is nearly constant across species. HSEs evolve in size, position, and sequence within heat-shock promoters. In turn, functional significance of certain features is implicated by preservation despite this evolutionary change; these features include tail-to-tail arrangements of HSEs, gapped HSEs, and the presence or absence of entire HSEs. The variation among Drosophila species indicates that the cis-regulatory encoding of responsiveness to heat and other stresses is diverse. The broad dimensions of variation uncovered are particularly important as they suggest a substantial challenge for functional studies.",2010,"Sibo Tian, Robert A Haney, Martin E Feder, Sibo Tian, Robert A Haney, Martin E Feder"
"Length polymorphism and head shape association among genes with polyglutamine repeats in the stalk-eyed fly, Teleopsis dalmanni",20663190,10.1186/1471-2148-10-227,"Background:
      
    

    
      Polymorphisms of single amino acid repeats (SARPs) are a potential source of genetic variation for rapidly evolving morphological traits. Here, we characterize variation in and test for an association between SARPs and head shape, a trait under strong sexual selection, in the stalk-eyed fly, Teleopsis dalmanni. Using an annotated expressed sequence tag database developed from eye-antennal imaginal disc tissues in T. dalmanni we identified 98 genes containing nine or more consecutive copies of a single amino acid. We then quantify variation in length and allelic diversity for 32 codon and 15 noncodon repeat regions in a large outbred population. We also assessed the frequency with which amino acid repeats are either gained or lost by identifying sequence similarities between T. dalmanni SARP loci and their orthologs in Drosophila melanogaster. Finally, to identify SARP containing genes that may influence head development we conducted a two-generation association study after assortatively mating for extreme relative eyespan.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We found that glutamine repeats occur more often than expected by amino acid abundance among 3,400 head development genes in T. dalmanni and D. melanogaster. Furthermore, glutamine repeats occur disproportionately in transcription factors. Loci with glutamine repeats exhibit heterozygosities and allelic diversities that do not differ from noncoding dinucleotide microsatellites, including greater variation among X-linked than autosomal regions. In the majority of cases, repeat tracts did not overlap between T. dalmanni and D. melanogaster indicating that large glutamine repeats are gained or lost frequently during Dipteran evolution. Analysis of covariance reveals a significant effect of parental genotype on mean progeny eyespan, with body length as a covariate, at six SARP loci [CG33692, ptip, band4.1 inhibitor LRP interactor, corto, 3531953:1, and ecdysone-induced protein 75B (Eip75B)]. Mixed model analysis of covariance using the eyespan of siblings segregating for repeat length variation confirms that significant genotype-phenotype associations exist for at least one sex at five of these loci and for one gene, CG33692, longer repeats were associated with longer relative eyespan in both sexes.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Among genes expressed during head development in stalk-eyed flies, long codon repeats typically contain glutamine, occur in transcription factors and exhibit high levels of heterozygosity. Furthermore, the presence of significant associations within families between repeat length and head shape indicates that six genes, or genes linked to them, contribute genetic variation to the development of this extremely sexually dimorphic trait.",2010,"Leanna M Birge, Marie L Pitts, Richard  H Baker, Gerald S Wilkinson, Leanna M Birge, Marie L Pitts, Richard  H Baker, Gerald S Wilkinson"
Stage-specific effects of candidate heterochronic genes on variation in developmental time along an altitudinal cline of Drosophila melanogaster,20585460,10.1371/journal.pone.0011229,"Background:
      
    

    
      Previously, we have shown there is clinal variation for egg-to-adult developmental time along geographic gradients in Drosophila melanogaster. Further, we also have identified mutations in genes involved in metabolic and neurogenic pathways that affect development time (heterochronic genes). However, we do not know whether these loci affect variation in developmental time in natural populations.
    

    
  


        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      Here, we constructed second chromosome substitution lines from natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster from an altitudinal cline, and measured egg-adult development time for each line. We found not only a large amount of genetic variation for developmental time, but also positive associations of the development time with thermal amplitude and altitude. We performed genetic complementation tests using substitution lines with the longest and shortest developmental times and heterochronic mutations. We identified segregating variation for neurogenic and metabolic genes that largely affected the duration of the larval stages but had no impact on the timing of metamorphosis.
    

    
  


        Conclusions/significance:
      
    

    
      Altitudinal clinal variation in developmental time for natural chromosome substitution lines provides a unique opportunity to dissect the response of heterochronic genes to environmental gradients.

However, recent studies in a number of model organisms, including mice, have reported that interventions that retard the aging process are, in fact, associated with an increase in mitochondrial activity. To better understand the relationship between energy metabolism and longevity, we supplemented the endogenous respiratory chain machinery of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster with the alternative single-subunit NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Ndi1) of the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we report that expression of Ndi1 in fly mitochondria leads to an increase in NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity, oxygen consumption, and ATP levels. In addition, exogenous Ndi1 expression results in increased CO2 production in living flies. Using an inducible gene-expression system, we expressed Ndi1 in different cells and tissues and examined the impact on longevity.

OpenFlyData: an exemplar data web integrating gene expression data on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,20382263,10.1016/j.jbi.2010.04.004,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Integrating heterogeneous data across distributed sources is a major requirement for in silico bioinformatics supporting translational research. For example, genome-scale data on patterns of gene expression in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster are widely used in functional genomic studies in many organisms to inform candidate gene selection and validate experimental results. However, current data integration solutions tend to be heavy weight, and require significant initial and ongoing investment of effort. Development of a common Web-based data integration infrastructure (a.k.a. data web), using Semantic Web standards, promises to alleviate these difficulties, but little is known about the feasibility, costs, risks or practical means of migrating to such an infrastructure.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We describe the development of OpenFlyData, a proof-of-concept system integrating gene expression data on D. melanogaster, combining Semantic Web standards with light-weight approaches to Web programming based on Web 2.0 design patterns. To support researchers designing and validating functional genomic studies, OpenFlyData includes user-facing search applications providing intuitive access to and comparison of gene expression data from FlyAtlas, the BDGP in situ database, and FlyTED, using data from FlyBase to expand and disambiguate gene names. OpenFlyData's services are also openly accessible, and are available for reuse by other bioinformaticians and application developers. Semi-automated methods and tools were developed to support labour- and knowledge-intensive tasks involved in deploying SPARQL services. These include methods for generating ontologies and relational-to-RDF mappings for relational databases, which we illustrate using the FlyBase Chado database schema; and methods for mapping gene identifiers between databases. The advantages of using Semantic Web standards for biomedical data integration are discussed, as are open issues. In particular, although the performance of open source SPARQL implementations is sufficient to query gene expression data directly from user-facing applications such as Web-based data fusions (a.k.a. mashups), we found open SPARQL endpoints to be vulnerable to denial-of-service-type problems, which must be mitigated to ensure reliability of services based on this standard. These results are relevant to data integration activities in translational bioinformatics.

GABA-B receptors in Drosophila,20655492,10.1016/S1054-3589(10)58017-7,"Drosophila melanogaster, the ""fruit fly,"" is being increasingly used as an experimental model in neurosciences, including neuropharmacology. The advantages of Drosophila over typical mammalian models in neuropharmacology include better access to genetic manipulation and the availability of almost unlimited numbers of experimental subjects at relatively low cost and with minimal regulatory restrictions. Nevertheless, one should remain cognizant of the substantial differences between insects and mammals. Insects, including Drosophila, utilize gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a neurotransmitter and express both ionotropic GABA receptors and metabotropic GABA-B receptors. Before cloning of the Drosophila GABA-B receptors (subunits 1-3), it had been assumed that flies did not express these receptors since baclofen, a typical agonist for mammalian GABA-B receptors, does not produce any effects in insects. Subsequently, it was confirmed that cloned Drosophila GABA-B receptors exhibit a unique pharmacology. Using Drosophila as a model, it has been shown that GABA-B receptors are involved in the behavioral actions of alcohol and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, and possibly in pain. Furthermore, recent research suggests that in flies these receptors may play an important developmental role and that they participate in olfaction and in regulation of circadian rhythms.",2010,"Hari Manev, Svetlana Dzitoyeva, Hari Manev, Svetlana Dzitoyeva"
Partial ablation of adult Drosophila insulin-producing neurons modulates glucose homeostasis and extends life span without insulin resistance,20699643,10.4161/cc.9.15.12458,"In Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster), neurosecretory insulin-like peptide-producing cells (IPCs), analogous to mammalian pancreatic beta cells are involved in glucose homeostasis. Extending those findings, we have developed in the adult fly an oral glucose tolerance test and demonstrated that IPCs indeed are responsible for executing an acute glucose clearance response. To further develop D. melanogaster as a relevant system for studying age-associated metabolic disorders, we set out to determine the impact of adult-specific partial ablation of IPCs (IPC knockdown) on insulin-like peptide (ILP) action, metabolic outcomes and longevity. Interestingly, while IPC knockdown flies are hyperglycemic and glucose intolerant, these flies remain insulin sensitive as measured by peripheral glucose disposal upon insulin injection and serine phosphorylation of a key insulin-signaling molecule, Akt. Significant increases in stored glycogen and triglyceride levels as well as an elevated level of circulating lipid measured in adult IPC knockdown flies suggest profound modulation in energy metabolism. Additional physiological outcomes measured in those flies include increased resistance to starvation and impaired female fecundity. Finally, increased life span and decreased mortality rates measured in IPC knockdown flies demonstrate that it is possible to modulate ILP action in adult flies to achieve life span extension without insulin resistance. Taken together, we have established and validated an invertebrate genetic system to further investigate insulin action, metabolic homeostasis and regulation of aging regulated by adult IPCs.",2010,"Aaron Haselton, Effat Sharmin, Janel Schrader, Megha Sah, Peter Poon, Yih-Woei C Fridell, Aaron Haselton, Effat Sharmin, Janel Schrader, Megha Sah, Peter Poon, Yih-Woei C Fridell"

Subunits of the Drosophila CCR4-NOT complex and their roles in mRNA deadenylation,20504953,10.1261/rna.2145110,"The CCR4-NOT complex is the main enzyme catalyzing the deadenylation of mRNA. We have investigated the composition of this complex in Drosophila melanogaster by immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody directed against NOT1. The CCR4, CAF1 (=POP2), NOT1, NOT2, NOT3, and CAF40 subunits were associated in a stable complex, but NOT4 was not. Factors known to be involved in mRNA regulation were prominent among the other proteins coprecipitated with the CCR4-NOT complex, as analyzed by mass spectrometry. The complex was localized mostly in the cytoplasm but did not appear to be a major component of P bodies. Of the known CCR4 paralogs, Nocturnin was found associated with the subunits of the CCR4-NOT complex, whereas Angel and 3635 were not. RNAi experiments in Schneider cells showed that CAF1, NOT1, NOT2, and NOT3 are required for bulk poly(A) shortening and hsp70 mRNA deadenylation, but knock-down of CCR4, CAF40, and NOT4 did not affect these processes. Overexpression of catalytically dead CAF1 had a dominant-negative effect on mRNA decay. In contrast, overexpression of inactive CCR4 had no effect. We conclude that CAF1 is the major catalytically important subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex in Drosophila Schneider cells. Nocturnin may also be involved in mRNA deadenylation, whereas there is no evidence for a similar role of Angel and 3635.",2010,"Claudia Temme, Lianbing Zhang, Elisabeth Kremmer, Christian Ihling, Aymeric Chartier, Andrea Sinz, Martine Simonelig, Elmar Wahle, Claudia Temme, Lianbing Zhang, Elisabeth Kremmer, Christian Ihling, Aymeric Chartier, Andrea Sinz, Martine Simonelig, Elmar Wahle"
Modulation of genotoxicity by extra-virgin olive oil and some of its distinctive components assessed by use of the Drosophila wing-spot test,20732449,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2010.08.012,"Olive oil is an important source of mono-unsaturated fat and a prime component of the Mediterranean diet.

The objective of this study was to investigate the basis for the epidemiological information relating to the health benefits associated with the consumption of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO). For this purpose, the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in wings of Drosophila melanogaster was applied to evaluate the antigenotoxic activity of six different EVOOs from four Spanish varieties (Hojiblanca, Nevadillo, Casta de Cabra, Picual). A two-level approach was followed: (1) determination of the lack of genotoxicity along with the antigenotoxic activity of EVOOs, through antigenotoxicity assays, with hydrogen peroxide as an oxidative genotoxin, and (2) evaluation of the properties of three major distinctive components of EVOOs that could be responsible for their antigenotoxic activity. The EVOOs tested are shown to be non-genotoxic; they exhibited antigenotoxic activity against the effects of hydrogen peroxide. Triolein, tyrosol and squalene did not show genotoxic effects in the proliferative imaginal cells of D. melanogaster. The three components were antigenotoxic when combined with soybean oil, only triolein and tyrosol showed a clear desmutagenic effect when combined with hydrogen peroxide.

The compounds studied have previously been shown to protect neurons of the rat brain from oxidative stress in the descending order of efficiency: RTC > STC > carnosine. The finding obtained in the present study suggests another order of efficacy regarding the effect on life span in male insects: STC > carnosine > RTC (inefficient).

Animal cryptochromes mediate magnetoreception by an unconventional photochemical mechanism,20098414,10.1038/nature08719,"Understanding the biophysical basis of animal magnetoreception has been one of the greatest challenges in sensory biology. Recently it was discovered that the light-dependent magnetic sense of Drosophila melanogaster is mediated by the ultraviolet (UV)-A/blue light photoreceptor cryptochrome (Cry). Here we show, using a transgenic approach, that the photoreceptive, Drosophila-like type 1 Cry and the transcriptionally repressive, vertebrate-like type 2 Cry of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) can both function in the magnetoreception system of Drosophila and require UV-A/blue light (wavelength below 420 nm) to do so. The lack of magnetic responses for both Cry types at wavelengths above 420 nm does not fit the widely held view that tryptophan triad-generated radical pairs mediate the ability of Cry to sense a magnetic field. We bolster this assessment by using a mutant form of Drosophila and monarch type 1 Cry and confirm that the tryptophan triad pathway is not crucial in magnetic transduction. Together, these results suggest that animal Crys mediate light-dependent magnetoreception through an unconventional photochemical mechanism. This work emphasizes the utility of Drosophila transgenesis for elucidating the precise mechanisms of Cry-mediated magnetosensitivity in insects and also in vertebrates such as migrating birds.",2010,"Robert J Gegear, Lauren E Foley, Amy Casselman, Steven M Reppert, Robert J Gegear, Lauren E Foley, Amy Casselman, Steven M Reppert"
Physiological climatic limits in Drosophila: patterns and implications,20190112,10.1242/jeb.037630,"Physiological limits determine susceptibility to environmental changes, and can be assessed at the individual, population or species/lineage levels. Here I discuss these levels in Drosophila, and consider implications for determining species susceptibility to climate change. Limits at the individual level in Drosophila depend on experimental technique and on the context in which traits are evaluated. At the population level, evidence from selection experiments particularly involving Drosophila melanogaster indicate high levels of heritable variation and evolvability for coping with thermal stresses and aridity. An exception is resistance to high temperatures, which reaches a plateau in selection experiments and has a low heritability/evolvability when temperatures are ramped up to a stressful level. In tropical Drosophila species, populations are limited in their ability to evolve increased desiccation and cold resistance. Population limits can arise from trait and gene interactions but results from different laboratory studies are inconsistent and likely to underestimate the strength of interactions under field conditions. Species and lineage comparisons suggest phylogenetic conservatism for resistance to thermal extremes and other stresses. Plastic responses set individual limits but appear to evolve slowly in Drosophila. There is more species-level variation in lower thermal limits and desiccation resistance compared with upper limits, which might reflect different selection pressures and/or low evolvability. When extremes are considered, tropical Drosophila species do not appear more threatened than temperate species by higher temperatures associated with global warming, contrary to recent conjectures. However, species from the humid tropics may be threatened if they cannot adapt genetically to drier conditions.",2010,"A A Hoffmann, A A Hoffmann"

However, female preference is relatively poorly understood, particularly the relative importance of a female's genes, the environment and their interaction on her preference. We investigated preference in a no-choice design using Drosophila melanogaster iso-female lines and find that there are genotype-by-environment interactions for female preference. Whereas the choosiness of some female genotypes differed little across environments, that of others differed greatly, so that the choosiness rank of females in one environment did not necessarily predict their rank in another. Furthermore, the genetic variance underlying preference also varied across environments.

Drcd-1 related: a positively selected spermatogenesis retrogene in Drosophila,20694743,10.1007/s10709-010-9474-8,"Gene duplication is a major force driving genome evolution, and examples of this mode of evolution and of the functions of duplicated genes are needed to reveal general patterns. Here, our study focuses on a particular retrogene (i.e., CG9573) that originated about 5-13 million years ago that we have named Drcd-1 related. It originated in Drosophila through retroposition of the parental gene Required for cell differentiation 1 of Drosophila (Drcd-1; CG14213), which is a known transcription cofactor. Drcd-1r is only present in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. mauritiana. Drcd-1r is an X to autosome retroposition event. Many retrogenes are X to autosome copies and it has been shown that positive selection underlies this bias. We sought to understand Drcd-1r mode of evolution and function to contribute to the understanding of the selective pressures acting on X to autosome retrogenes. Drcd-1r overlaps with another gene, it is within the 3' UTR of the gene CG13102 and is encoded in the opposite orientation. We have studied the characteristics of the transcripts and quantified expression of CG13102 and Drcd-1r in wild-type flies. We found that Drcd-1r is transcribed specifically in testes. We also studied the molecular evolution of Drcd-1r and Drcd-1 and found that the parental gene has evolved under very strong purifying selection but the retrogene has evolved very rapidly (Ka/Ks ~1) under both positive and purifying selection, as revealed using divergence and polymorphism data. These results indicate that Drcd-1r has a novel function in the Drosophila testes. To further explore Drcd-1r function we used a strain containing a P element inserted in the region where CG13102 and Drcd-1r are located that shows recessive male sterility. Analysis of this strain reveals the difficulties that can be encountered in studying the functions of genes with overlapping transcripts.

Antifreeze protein genes, dafp-1 and/or dafp-4, from the freeze-avoiding insect, Dendroides canadensis, were transferred to Drosophila melanogaster via P-element-mediated transformation. The Northern and Western blots showed expression of DAFP(s) at both transcript and protein levels. The highest thermal hysteresis activity of 6.78+/-0.12 degrees C was detected in 5-day adult flies containing two copies of each of the dafp-1 and dafp-4 genes, while flies with two copies of either dafp-1 or dafp-4 had less activity, 5.52 and 3.24 degrees C, respectively (measured by nanoliter osmometer). This suggests synergistic enhancement of thermal hysteresis activity between DAFP-1 and DAFP-4 in transgenic D. melanogaster containing both DAFPs. Supercooling points without ice in contact with the insects were lowered in all 5 transgenic lines compared with controls, however, when ice was in contact with the flies, supercooling points were lowered only in the heterozygous <DAFP-1>+<DAFP-4> transgenic line.

Sex determination: insights from the silkworm,20877002,10.1007/s12041-010-0047-5,"The sex-determining system differs considerably among organisms. Even among insect species, the genetic system for sexdetermination is highly diversified. In Drosophila melanogaster, somatic sexual differentiation is regulated by a well characterized genetic hierarchy X:A > Sxl > tra/tra2 > dsx and fru. This cascade seems to control sex determination in all Drosophila species and is partially conserved in another dipteran species, Ceratitis capitata: Cctra/Cctra-2 > Ccdsx and Ccfru. However, in the silkworm, Bombyx mori, femaleness is determined by the presence of a dominant feminizing factor on the W chromosome. Moreover, no sex-specific regulatory Sxl homolog has been isolated from B. mori. Also, no tra homolog has yet been found in the Bombyx genome. Despite such differences, dsx homolog of B. mori (Bmdsx) is implicated in the sex determination. Bmdsx produces alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms that encode sex specific transcription factors as observed in dsx. While the female-specific splicing of dsx is activated by splicing activators, Tra and Tra2, the female splicing of Bmdsx represents the default mode. Instead, a splicing inhibitor, BmPSI is involved in the regulation of male-specific splicing of Bmdsx. Since BmPSI does not exhibit any sequence relationship to known SR proteins, such as Tra and Tra2, the regulatory mechanism of sex-specific alternative splicing of Bmdsx is distinct from that of dsx.",2010,"Masataka G Suzuki, Masataka G Suzuki"
Drosophila melanogaster lipins are tissue-regulated and developmentally regulated and present specific subcellular distributions,20977671,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07883.x,"Lipins constitute a novel family of Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidate phosphatases that catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to yield diacylglycerol, an important intermediate in lipid metabolism and cell signaling. Whereas a single lipin is detected in less complex organisms, in mammals there are distinct lipin isoforms and paralogs that are differentially expressed among tissues. Compatible with organism tissue complexity, we show that the single Drosophila Lpin1 ortholog (CG8709, here named DmLpin) expresses at least three isoforms (DmLpinA, DmLpinK and DmLpinJ) in a temporal and spatially regulated manner. The highest levels of lipin in the fat body, where DmLpinA and DmLpinK are expressed, correlate with the highest levels of triacylglycerol (TAG) measured in this tissue. DmLpinK is the most abundant isoform in the central nervous system, where TAG levels are significantly lower than in the fat body. In the testis, where TAG levels are even lower, DmLpinJ is the predominant isoform. Together, these data suggest that DmLpinA might be the isoform that is mainly involved in TAG production, and that DmLpinK and DmLpinJ could perform other cellular functions. In addition, we demonstrate by immunofluorescence that lipins are most strongly labeled in the perinuclear region of the fat body and ventral ganglion cells. In visceral muscles of the larval midgut and adult testis, lipins present a sarcomeric distribution. In the ovary chamber, the lipin signal is concentrated in the internal rim of the ring canal. These specific subcellular localizations of the Drosophila lipins provide the basis for future investigations on putative novel cellular functions of this protein family.",2010,"Valeria Valente, Rafaela Martins Maia, Murilo Carlos Bizam Vianna, Maria Luisa PaÃ§Ã³-Larson, Valeria Valente, Rafaela Martins Maia, Murilo Carlos Bizam Vianna, Maria Luisa PaÃ§Ã³-Larson"
Evolution of species-specific promoter-associated mechanisms for protecting chromosome ends by Drosophila Het-A telomeric transposons,20194755,10.1073/pnas.1000612107,"The non-LTR retrotransposons forming Drosophila telomeres constitute a robust mechanism for telomere maintenance, one which has persisted since before separation of the extant Drosophila species. These elements in D. melanogaster differ from nontelomeric retrotransposons in ways that give insight into general telomere biology. Here, we analyze telomere-specific retrotransposons from D. virilis, separated from D. melanogaster by 40 to 60 million years, to evaluate the evolutionary divergence of their telomeric traits. The telomeric retrotransposon HeT-A from D. melanogaster has an unusual promoter near its 3' terminus that drives not the element in which it resides, but the adjacent downstream element in a head-to-tail array. An obvious benefit of this promoter is that it adds nonessential sequence to the 5' end of each transcript, which is reverse transcribed and added to the chromosome. Because the 5' end of each newly transposed element forms the end of the chromosome until another element transposes onto it, this nonessential sequence can buffer erosion of sequence essential for HeT-A. Surprisingly, we have now found that HeT-A in D. virilis has a promoter typical of non-LTR retrotransposons. This promoter adds no buffering sequence; nevertheless, the complete 5' end of the element persists in telomere arrays, necessitating a more precise processing of the extreme end of the telomere in D. virilis.",2010,"Karen L Traverse, Janet A George, P G Debaryshe, Mary-Lou Pardue, Karen L Traverse, Janet A George, P G Debaryshe, Mary-Lou Pardue"
Expression of multiple copies of mitochondrially targeted catalase or genomic Mn superoxide dismutase transgenes does not extend the life span of Drosophila melanogaster,20923705,10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2010.09.029,"The simultaneous overexpression of multiple copies of Mn superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ectopic catalase (mtCat) transgenes in the mitochondria of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, was shown previously to diminish the life span. The hypothesis tested in this study was that this effect was due primarily to the presence of one or the other transgene. An alternative hypothesis was that both transgenes have additive, negative effects. Crosses were performed between five pairs of transgenic lines containing single-copy insertions of mtCat, Mn SOD, or P element vector control transgenes at unique loci, and the life spans of progeny containing two mtCat, Mn SOD, or vector insertions were determined. Increasing amounts of mitochondrial catalase activity tended to be associated with decreases in mean life span. Overexpression of two copies of the genomic Mn SOD transgene had no effect on life span.

Drosophila melanogaster larvae as a model for blast lung injury,20173659,10.1097/TA.0b013e3181c42649,"Background:
      
    

    
      Primary blast injuries, specifically lung injuries, resulting from blast overpressure exposures are a major source of mortality for victims of blast events. However, existing pulmonary injury criteria are inappropriate for common exposure environments. This study uses Drosophila melanogaster larvae to develop a simple phenomenological model for human pulmonary injury from primary blast exposure.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Drosophila larvae were exposed to blast overpressures generated by a 5.1-cm internal diameter shock tube and their mortality was observed after the exposure. To establish mortality thresholds, a survival analysis was conducted using survival data and peak incident pressures. In addition, a histologic analysis was performed on the larvae to establish the mechanisms of blast injury.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The results of the survival analysis suggest that blast overpressure for 50% Drosophila survival is greater than human threshold lung injury and is similar to human 50% survival levels, in the range of overpressure durations tested (1-5 ms). A ""parallel"" analysis of the Bass et al. 50% human survival curves indicates that 50% Drosophila survival is equivalent to a human injury resulting in a 69% chance of survival. Histologic analysis of the blast-exposed larvae failed to demonstrate damage to the dorsal trunk of the tracheal system; however, the presence of flocculent material in the larvae body cavities and tracheas suggests tissue damage.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study shows that D. melanogaster survival can be correlated with large animal injury models to approximate a human blast lung injury tolerance. Within the range of durations tested, Drosophila larvae may be used as a simple model for blast injury.",2010,"Cameron R Bass, Kevin P Meyerhoff, Andrew M Damon, Andrew M Bellizzi, Robert S Salzar, Karin A Rafaels, Cameron R Bass, Kevin P Meyerhoff, Andrew M Damon, Andrew M Bellizzi, Robert S Salzar, Karin A Rafaels"

Drosophila Kelch functions with Cullin-3 to organize the ring canal actin cytoskeleton,20065088,10.1083/jcb.200909017,"Drosophila melanogaster Kelch (KEL) is the founding member of a diverse protein family defined by a repeated sequence motif known as the KEL repeat (KREP). Several KREP proteins, including Drosophila KEL, bind filamentous actin (F-actin) and contribute to its organization. Recently, a subset of KREP proteins has been shown to function as substrate adaptor proteins for cullin-RING (really interesting new gene) ubiquitin E3 ligases. In this study, we demonstrate that association of Drosophila KEL with Cullin-3, likely in a cullin-RING ligase, is essential for the growth of Drosophila female germline ring canals.

A novel predicted bromodomain-related protein affects coordination between meiosis and spermiogenesis in Drosophila and is required for male meiotic cytokinesis,20491580,10.1089/dna.2009.0989,"Temporal coordination of meiosis with spermatid morphogenesis is crucial for successful generation of mature sperm cells. We identified a recessive male sterile Drosophila melanogaster mutant, mitoshell, in which events of spermatid morphogenesis are initiated too early, before meiotic onset. Premature mitochondrial aggregation and fusion lead to an aberrant mitochondrial shell around premeiotic nuclei. Despite successful meiotic karyokinesis, improper mitochondrial localization in mitoshell testes is associated with defective astral central spindles and a lack of contractile rings, leading to meiotic cytokinesis failure. We mapped and cloned the mitoshell gene and found that it encodes a novel protein with a bromodomain-related region. It is conserved in some insect lineages. Bromodomains typically bind to histone acetyl-lysine residues and therefore are often associated with chromatin. The Mitoshell bromodomain-related region is predicted to have an alpha helical structure similar to that of bromodomains, but not all the crucial residues in the ligand-binding loops are conserved. We speculate that Mitoshell may participate in transcriptional regulation of spermatogenesis-specific genes, though perhaps with different ligand specificity compared to traditional bromodomains.",2010,"Laura M Bergner, F Edward Hickman, Kathleen H Wood, Carolyn M Wakeman, Hunter H Stone, Tessa J Campbell, Samantha B Lightcap, Sheena M Favors, Amanda C Aldridge, Karen G Hales, Laura M Bergner, F Edward Hickman, Kathleen H Wood, Carolyn M Wakeman, Hunter H Stone, Tessa J Campbell, Samantha B Lightcap, Sheena M Favors, Amanda C Aldridge, Karen G Hales"
SIDL interacts with the dendritic targeting motif of Shal (K(v)4) K+ channels in Drosophila,20550966,10.1016/j.mcn.2010.06.001,"Shal K(+) (K(v)4) channels in mammalian neurons have been shown to be localized exclusively to somato-dendritic regions of neurons, where they function as key determinants of dendritic excitability. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying dendritic localization of K(v)4 channels, we use Drosophila melanogaster as our model system. We show that Shal K(+) channels display a conserved somato-dendritic localization in vivo in Drosophila. From a yeast-2-hybrid screen, we identify the novel interactor, SIDL (for Shal Interactor of Di-Leucine Motif), as the first target protein reported to bind the highly conserved di-leucine motif (LL-motif) implicated in dendritic targeting. We show that SIDL is expressed primarily in the nervous system, co-localizes with GFP-Shal channels in neurons, and interacts specifically with the LL-motif of Drosophila and mouse Shal channels. We disrupt the Shal-SIDL interaction by mutating the LL-motif on Shal channels, and show that Shal K(+) channels are then mislocalized to some, but not all, axons in vivo. These results suggest that there are multiple mechanisms underlying Shal K(+) channel targeting, one of which depends on the LL-motif. The identification of SIDL may provide the first step for future investigation into the molecular machinery regulating the LL-motif-dependent targeting of K(+) channels.",2010,"Fengqiu Diao, Jeremy Chaufty, Girma Waro, Susan Tsunoda, Fengqiu Diao, Jeremy Chaufty, Girma Waro, Susan Tsunoda"
MIPs are ancestral ligands for the sex peptide receptor,20308537,10.1073/pnas.0914764107,"Upon mating, females of many animal species undergo dramatic changes in their behavior. In Drosophila melanogaster, postmating behaviors are triggered by sex peptide (SP), which is produced in the male seminal fluid and transferred to female during copulation. SP modulates female behaviors via sex peptide receptor (SPR) located in a small subset of internal sensory neurons that innervate the female uterus and project to the CNS. Although required for postmating responses only in these female sensory neurons, SPR is expressed broadly in the CNS of both sexes. Moreover, SPR is also encoded in the genomes of insects that lack obvious SP orthologs. These observations suggest that SPR may have additional ligands and functions. Here, we identify myoinhibitory peptides (MIPs) as a second family of SPR ligands that is conserved across a wide range of invertebrate species. MIPs are potent agonists for Drosophila, Aedes, and Aplysia SPRs in vitro, yet are unable to trigger postmating responses in vivo. In contrast to SP, MIPs are not produced in male reproductive organs, and are not required for postmating behaviors in Drosophila females. We conclude that MIPs are evolutionarily conserved ligands for SPR, which are likely to mediate functions other than the regulation of female reproductive behaviors.",2010,"Young-Joon Kim, Katarina Bartalska, Neil Audsley, Naoki Yamanaka, Nilay Yapici, Ju-Youn Lee, Yong-Chul Kim, Milica Markovic, Elwyn Isaac, Yoshiaki Tanaka, Barry J Dickson, Young-Joon Kim, Katarina Bartalska, Neil Audsley, Naoki Yamanaka, Nilay Yapici, Ju-Youn Lee, Yong-Chul Kim, Milica Markovic, Elwyn Isaac, Yoshiaki Tanaka, Barry J Dickson"

We tested here the effect of adult female nutrition on the response of female Drosophila melanogaster to a specific ejaculate component, the sex peptide (SP), which is of interest because of its effects on female egg laying, sexual receptivity, feeding rate, immune responses and potential role in mediating sexual conflict. We exposed adult females to five different diets and kept them continuously with males that did or did not transfer SP. Diet altered the presence, magnitude and sign of the effects of SP on different phenotypic traits (egg laying, receptivity and lifespan) and different traits responded in different ways. This showed that the set of responses to mating can be uncoupled and can vary independently in different environments. Importantly, diet also significantly affected whether exposure to SP transferring males was beneficial or costly to females, with beneficial effects occurring more often than expected. Hence, the food environment can also shape significantly the strength and direction of selection on mating responses.",2010,"C Fricke, A Bretman, T Chapman, C Fricke, A Bretman, T Chapman"

Functional conservation of clock output signaling between flies and intertidal crabs,22215610,10.1177/0748730411420242,"Intertidal species have both circadian and circatidal clocks. Although the behavioral evidence for these oscillators is more than 5 decades old, virtually nothing is known about their molecular clockwork. Pigment-dispersing hormones (PDHs) were originally described in crustaceans. Their insect homologs, pigment-dispersing factors (PDFs), have a prominent role as clock output and synchronizing signals released from clock neurons. We show that gene duplication in crabs has led to two PDH genes (Î²-pdh-I and Î²-pdh-II). Phylogenetically, Î²-pdh-I is more closely related to insect pdf than to Î²-pdh-II, and we hypothesized that Î²-PDH-I may represent a canonical clock output signal. Accordingly, Î²-PDH-I expression in the brain of the intertidal crab Cancer productus is similar to that of PDF in Drosophila melanogaster, and neurons that express PDH-I also show CYCLE-like immunoreactivity. Using D. melanogaster pdf-null mutants (pdf(01)) as a heterologous system, we show that Î²-pdh-I is indistinguishable from pdf in its ability to rescue the mutant arrhythmic phenotype, but Î²-pdh-II fails to restore the wild-type phenotype. Application of the three peptides to explanted brains shows that PDF and Î²-PDH-I are equally effective in inducing the signal transduction cascade of the PDF receptor, but Î²-PDH-II fails to induce a normal cascade.

Specific downregulation of the expression of the Painless protein in the olfactory projection neurons (PNs) of the antennal lobes (ALs) resulted in a phenotype resembling that found in painless mutant flies, whereas overexpression of Painless in PNs of painless mutant males suppressed male-male courtship behavior. The downregulation of Painless exclusively during adulthood also resulted in male-male courtship behavior.

As-hid is the first identified non-drosophilid homolog of hid, and As-rpr is the second non-drosophilid rpr homolog. Both genes share more than 50% amino acid sequence identity with their Drosophila homologs, suggesting that insect pro-apoptotic peptides may be more conserved than previously anticipated. Importantly, both genes encode the conserved IBM and GH3 motifs that are key for IAP-inhibition and mitochondrial localization. Functional verification of both genes as cell death effectors was demonstrated by cell death assays in A. suspensa embryonic cell culture, as well as in heterologous Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. Notably, heterologous cell death activity was found to be higher for Anastrepha genes than their Drosophila counterparts. In common with the Drosophila cognates, As-hid and As-rpr negatively regulated the Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis (DIAP1) gene to promote apoptosis, and both genes when used together effected increased cell death activity, indicating a co-operative function for As-hid and As-rpr.

"An integrated Drosophila model system reveals unique properties for F14512, a novel polyamine-containing anticancer drug that targets topoisomerase II",21853156,10.1371/journal.pone.0023597,"F14512 is a novel anti-tumor molecule based on an epipodophyllotoxin core coupled to a cancer-cell vectoring spermine moiety. This polyamine linkage is assumed to ensure the preferential uptake of F14512 by cancer cells, strong interaction with DNA and potent inhibition of topoisomerase II (Topo II). The antitumor activity of F14512 in human tumor models is significantly higher than that of other epipodophyllotoxins in spite of a lower induction of DNA breakage. Hence, the demonstrated superiority of F14512 over other Topo II poisons might not result solely from its preferential uptake by cancer cells, but could also be due to unique effects on Topo II interactions with DNA. To further dissect the mechanism of action of F14512, we used Drosophila melanogaster mutants whose genetic background leads to an easily scored phenotype that is sensitive to changes in Topo II activity and/or localization. F14512 has antiproliferative properties in Drosophila cells and stabilizes ternary Topo II/DNA cleavable complexes at unique sites located in moderately repeated sequences, suggesting that the drug specifically targets a select and limited subset of genomic sequences. Feeding F14512 to developing mutant Drosophila larvae led to the recovery of flies expressing a striking phenotype, ""Eye wide shut,"" where one eye is replaced by a first thoracic segment.

Flavonoids and oxidative stress in Drosophila melanogaster,21907306,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2011.08.005,"Flavonoids are a family of antioxidants that are widely represented in fruits, vegetables, dry legumes, and chocolate, as well as in popular beverages, such as red wine, coffee, and tea. The flavonoids chlorogenic acid, kaempferol, quercetin and quercetin 3Î²-d-glycoside were investigated for genotoxicity using the wing somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART). This test makes use of two recessive wing cell markers: multiple wing hairs (mwh) and flare (flr(3)), which are mutations located on the left arm of chromosome 3 of Drosophila melanogaster and are indicative of both mitotic recombination and various types of mutational events. In order to test the antioxidant capacities of the flavonoids, experiments were conducted with various combinations of oxidants and polyphenols. Oxidative stress was induced using hydrogen peroxide, the Fenton reaction and paraquat. Third-instar transheterozygous larvae were chronically treated for all experiments. The data obtained in this study showed that, at the concentrations tested, the flavonoids did not induce somatic mutations or recombination in D. melanogaster with the exception of quercetin, which proved to be genotoxic at only one concentration. The oxidants hydrogen peroxide and the Fenton reaction did not induce mutations in the wing somatic assay of D. melanogaster, while paraquat and combinations of flavonoids produced significant numbers of small single spots. Quercetin 3Î²-d-glycoside mixed with paraquat was shown to be desmutagenic.

Iron depletion in the intestines of Malvolio mutant flies does not occur in the absence of a multicopper oxidase,21346125,10.1242/jeb.051664,"Malvolio (Mvl) encodes the sole Drosophila melanogaster homologue of divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1). The Drosophila transporter has been implicated in iron, manganese and copper cellular import. Indeed, the extent of metal specificity for this family of transporters is still under investigation in many eukaryotic species. Here, we revisit metal accumulation in Mvl mutants raised under normal and metal-supplemented diets. We found iron deficiency in Mvl mutant flies, whereas whole body copper and manganese concentrations remained unaltered. Iron supplementation restored total body iron concentrations in Mvl mutants, but without replenishing iron stores in the middle midgut, suggesting a role for Mvl in systemic iron trafficking, in addition to a role in intestinal iron absorption. Interestingly, dietary copper sulphate supplementation further exacerbated the iron deficiency. We investigated whether dietary copper affected iron storage through the function of an insect multicopper oxidase (MCO), because the mammalian MCO ceruloplasmin is known to regulate iron storage in the liver. We identified a Drosophila MCO mutant that suppressed aspects of the Mvl mutant phenotype and most notably Mvl, MCO3 double mutants showed normal intestinal iron storage. Therefore, MCO3 may encode an insect ferroxidase. Intriguingly, MCO3 mutants had a mild accumulation of copper, which was suppressed in Mvl mutants, revealing a reciprocal genetic interaction between the two genes.",2011,"Lucia Bettedi, Mohamad F Aslam, Joanna Szular, Konstantinos Mandilaras, Fanis Missirlis, Lucia Bettedi, Mohamad F Aslam, Joanna Szular, Konstantinos Mandilaras, Fanis Missirlis"
Neural correlates of illusory motion perception in Drosophila,21586635,10.1073/pnas.1100062108,"When the contrast of an image flickers as it moves, humans perceive an illusory reversal in the direction of motion. This classic illusion, called reverse-phi motion, has been well-characterized using psychophysics, and several models have been proposed to account for its effects. Here, we show that Drosophila melanogaster also respond behaviorally to the reverse-phi illusion and that the illusion is present in dendritic calcium signals of motion-sensitive neurons in the fly lobula plate. These results closely match the predictions of the predominant model of fly motion detection. However, high flicker rates cause an inversion of the reverse-phi behavioral response that is also present in calcium signals of lobula plate tangential cell dendrites but not predicted by the model. The fly's behavioral and neural responses to the reverse-phi illusion reveal unexpected interactions between motion and flicker signals in the fly visual system and suggest that a similar correlation-based mechanism underlies visual motion detection across the animal kingdom.",2011,"John C Tuthill, M Eugenia Chiappe, Michael B Reiser, John C Tuthill, M Eugenia Chiappe, Michael B Reiser"
Wild-type Drosophila melanogaster as a model host to analyze nitrogen source dependent virulence of Candida albicans,22110651,10.1371/journal.pone.0027434,"The fungal pathogen Candida albicans is a common cause of opportunistic infections in humans. We report that wild-type Drosophila melanogaster (OrR) flies are susceptible to virulent C. albicans infections and have established experimental conditions that enable OrR flies to serve as model hosts for studying C. albicans virulence. After injection into the thorax, wild-type C. albicans cells disseminate and invade tissues throughout the fly, leading to lethality. Similar to results obtained monitoring systemic infections in mice, well-characterized cph1? efg1? and csh3? fungal mutants exhibit attenuated virulence in flies. Using the OrR fly host model, we assessed the virulence of C. albicans strains individually lacking functional components of the SPS sensing pathway. In response to extracellular amino acids, the plasma membrane localized SPS-sensor (Ssy1, Ptr3, and Ssy5) activates two transcription factors (Stp1 and Stp2) to differentially control two distinct modes of nitrogen acquisition (host protein catabolism and amino acid uptake, respectively). Our results indicate that a functional SPS-sensor and Stp1 controlled genes required for host protein catabolism and utilization, including the major secreted aspartyl protease SAP2, are required to establish virulent infections. By contrast, Stp2, which activates genes required for amino acid uptake, is dispensable for virulence. These results indicate that nutrient availability within infected hosts directly influences C. albicans virulence.",2011,"Monica M Davis, Francisco J Alvarez, Kicki Ryman, ?sa A Holm, Per O Ljungdahl, Ylva EngstrÃ¶m, Monica M Davis, Francisco J Alvarez, Kicki Ryman, ?sa A Holm, Per O Ljungdahl, Ylva EngstrÃ¶m"
Cyclic presence and absence of conspecifics alters circadian clock phase but does not entrain the locomotor activity rhythm of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,21797778,10.3109/07420528.2011.591018,"Circadian clocks use a wide range of environmental cues, including cycles of light, temperature, food, and social interactions, to fine-tune rhythms in behavior and physiology. Although social cues have been shown to influence circadian clocks of a variety of organisms including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, their mechanism of action is still unclear. Here, the authors report the results of their study aimed at investigating if daily cycles of presence and absence (PA) of conspecific male visitors are able to entrain the circadian locomotor activity rhythm of male hosts living under constant darkness (DD). The results suggest that PA cycles may not be able to entrain circadian locomotor activity rhythms of Drosophila. The outcome does not change when male hosts are presented with female visitors, suggesting that PA cycles of either sex may not be effective in bringing about stable entrainment of circadian clocks in D. melanogaster. However, in hosts whose clock phase has already been set by light/dark (LD) cycles, daily PA cycles of visitors can cause measurable change in the phase of subsequent free-running rhythms, provided that their circadian clocks are labile. Thus, the findings of this study suggest that D. melanogaster males may not be using cyclic social cues as their primary zeitgeber (time cue) for entrainment of circadian clocks, although social cues are capable of altering the phase of their circadian rhythms.",2011,"Shahnaz Rahman Lone, Madhumala K Sadanandappa, Vijay Kumar Sharma"
Genetic variation in heat-stress tolerance among South American Drosophila populations,22350564,10.1007/s10709-012-9635-z,"Spatial or temporal differences in environmental variables, such as temperature, are ubiquitous in nature and impose stress on organisms. This is especially true for organisms that are isothermal with the environment, such as insects. Understanding the means by which insects respond to temperature and how they will react to novel changes in environmental temperature is important for understanding the adaptive capacity of populations and to predict future trajectories of evolutionary change. The organismal response to heat has been identified as an important environmental variable for insects that can dramatically influence life history characters and geographic range. In the current study we surveyed the amount of variation in heat tolerance among Drosophila melanogaster populations collected at diverse sites along a latitudinal gradient in Argentina (24Â°-38Â°S). This is the first study to quantify heat tolerance in South American populations and our work demonstrates that most of the populations surveyed have abundant within-population phenotypic variation, while still exhibiting significant variation among populations. The one exception was the most heat tolerant population that comes from a climate exhibiting the warmest annual mean temperature. All together our results suggest there is abundant genetic variation for heat-tolerance phenotypes within and among natural populations of Drosophila and this variation has likely been shaped by environmental temperature.",2011,"Lindsey C Fallis, Juan Jose Fanara, Theodore J Morgan, Lindsey C Fallis, Juan Jose Fanara, Theodore J Morgan"

Experimental selection of hypoxia-tolerant Drosophila melanogaster,21262834,10.1073/pnas.1010643108,"Through long-term laboratory selection (over 200 generations), we have generated Drosophila melanogaster populations that tolerate severe, normally lethal, levels of hypoxia. Because of initial experiments suspecting genetic mechanisms underlying this adaptation, we compared the genomes of the hypoxia-selected flies with those of controls using deep resequencing. By applying unique computing and analytical methods we identified a number of DNA regions under selection, mostly on the X chromosome. Several of the hypoxia-selected regions contained genes encoding or regulating the Notch pathway. In addition, previous expression profiling revealed an activation of the Notch pathway in the hypoxia-selected flies. We confirmed the contribution of Notch activation to hypoxia tolerance using a specific Î³-secretase inhibitor, N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), which significantly reduced adult survival and life span in the hypoxia-selected flies. We also demonstrated that flies with loss-of-function Notch mutations or RNAi-mediated Notch knockdown had a significant reduction in hypoxia tolerance, but those with a gain-of-function had a dramatic opposite effect. Using the UAS-Gal4 system, we also showed that specific overexpression of the Notch intracellular domain in glial cells was critical for conferring hypoxia tolerance.

Lipin is a central regulator of adipose tissue development and function in Drosophila melanogaster,21300783,10.1128/MCB.01335-10,"Lipins are evolutionarily conserved proteins found from yeasts to humans. Mammalian and yeast lipin proteins have been shown to control gene expression and to enzymatically convert phosphatidate to diacylglycerol, an essential precursor in triacylglcerol (TAG) and phospholipid synthesis. Loss of lipin 1 in the mouse, but not in humans, leads to lipodystrophy and fatty liver disease. Here we show that the single lipin orthologue of Drosophila melanogaster (dLipin) is essential for normal adipose tissue (fat body) development and TAG storage. dLipin mutants are characterized by reductions in larval fat body mass, whole-animal TAG content, and lipid droplet size. Individual cells of the underdeveloped fat body are characterized by increased size and ultrastructural defects affecting cell nuclei, mitochondria, and autophagosomes. Under starvation conditions, dLipin is transcriptionally upregulated and functions to promote survival. Together, these data show that dLipin is a central player in lipid and energy metabolism, and they establish Drosophila as a genetic model for further studies of conserved functions of the lipin family of metabolic regulators.",2011,"Rupali Ugrankar, Yanling Liu, Jill Provaznik, Sandra Schmitt, Michael Lehmann, Rupali Ugrankar, Yanling Liu, Jill Provaznik, Sandra Schmitt, Michael Lehmann"
E2 ligase dRad6 regulates DMP53 turnover in Drosophila,21205821,10.1074/jbc.M110.190314,"The turnover of tumor suppressor p53 is critical for its role in various cellular events. However, the pathway that regulates the turnover of the Drosophila melanogaster DMP53 is largely unknown. Here, we provide evidence for the first time that the E2 ligase, Drosophila homolog of Rad6 (dRad6/Dhr6), plays an important role in the regulation of DMP53 turnover. Depletion of dRad6 results in DMP53 accumulation, whereas overexpression of dRad6 causes enhanced DMP53 degradation. We show that dRad6 specifically interacts with DMP53 at the transcriptional activation domain and regulates DMP53 ubiquitination. Loss of dRad6 function in transgenic flies leads to lethalities and altered morphogenesis. The dRad6-induced defects in cell proliferation and apoptosis are found to be DMP53-dependent. The loss of dRad6 induces an accumulation of DMP53 that enhances the activation of apoptotic genes and leads to apoptosis in the presence of stress stimuli. In contrast to that, the E3 ligase is the primary factor that regulates p53 turnover in mammals, and this work demonstrates that the E2 ligase dRad6 is critical for the control of DMP53 degradation in Drosophila.",2011,"Su Chen, Hui-Min Wei, Wen-Wen Lv, Da-Liang Wang, Fang-Lin Sun, Su Chen, Hui-Min Wei, Wen-Wen Lv, Da-Liang Wang, Fang-Lin Sun"
Analysis of micro- and nano-structures of the corneal surface of Drosophila and its mutants by atomic force microscopy and optical diffraction,21811578,10.1371/journal.pone.0022237,"Drosophila melanogaster is a model organism instrumental for numerous biological studies. The compound eye of this insect consists of some eight hundred individual ommatidia or facets, ca. 15 Âµm in cross-section. Each ommatidium contains eighteen cells including four cone cells secreting the lens material (cornea). High-resolution imaging of the cornea of different insects has demonstrated that each lens is covered by the nipple arrays--small outgrowths of ca. 200 nm in diameter. Here we for the first time utilize atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate nipple arrays of the Drosophila lens, achieving an unprecedented visualization of the architecture of these nanostructures. We find by Fourier analysis that the nipple arrays of Drosophila are disordered, and that the seemingly ordered appearance is a consequence of dense packing of the nipples. In contrast, Fourier analysis confirms the visibly ordered nature of the eye microstructures--the individual lenses. This is different in the frizzled mutants of Drosophila, where both Fourier analysis and optical imaging detect disorder in lens packing. AFM reveals intercalations of the lens material between individual lenses in frizzled mutants, providing explanation for this disorder. In contrast, nanostructures of the mutant lens show the same organization as in wild-type flies. Thus, frizzled mutants display abnormal organization of the corneal micro-, but not nano-structures. At the same time, nipples of the mutant flies are shorter than those of the wild-type. We also analyze corneal surface of glossy-appearing eyes overexpressing Wingless--the lipoprotein ligand of Frizzled receptors, and find the catastrophic aberration in nipple arrays, providing experimental evidence in favor of the major anti-reflective function of these insect eye nanostructures.

This work constitutes the first complex study focused on in vivo evaluation of the acute and chronic toxic effects and toxic limits of silver nanoparticles (NPs) on the eukaryotic organism Drosophila melanogaster. For the purpose of this study, silver NPs were prepared in the form of solid dispersion using microencapsulation method, where mannitol was used as an encapsulation agent. This newly prepared solid dispersion with a high concentration of silver NPs was exploited to prepare the standard Drosophila culture medium at a silver concentration range from 10 mgÂ·L(-1) to 100 mgÂ·L(-1) of Ag in the case of the acute toxicity testing and at a concentration equal to 5 mgÂ·L(-1) in the case of the chronic toxicity testing. The acute toxic effect of silver NPs on Drosophila melanogaster was observed for the silver concentration equal to 20 mgÂ·L(-1). At this silver concentration, 50% of the tested flies were unable to leave the pupae, and they did not finish their developmental cycle. Chronic toxicity of silver NPs was assessed by a long-term exposure of overall eight filial generations of Drosophila melanogaster to silver NPs. The long-term exposure to silver NPs influenced the fertility of Drosophila during the first three filial generations, nevertheless the fecundity of flies in subsequent generations consequently increased up to the level of the flies from the control sample due to the adaptability of flies to the silver NPs exposure.",2011,"Ales Panacek, Robert Prucek, Dana Safarova, Milan Dittrich, Jana Richtrova, Katerina Benickova, Radek Zboril, Libor Kvitek, Ales Panacek, Robert Prucek, Dana Safarova, Milan Dittrich, Jana Richtrova, Katerina Benickova, Radek Zboril, Libor Kvitek"

Therefore, variation in the developmental period under controlled genetic and environmental conditions indicates innate instability of the developmental process. In this study, we aimed to determine whether a molecular machinery exists that regulates the canalization of the developmental period and, if so, to test whether the same mechanism also stabilizes a morphological trait. To search for regions that influence the instability of the developmental period, we conducted genome-wide deficiency mapping with 441 isogenic deficiency strains covering 65.5% of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. We found that 11 independent deficiencies significantly increased the instability of the developmental period and 5 of these also significantly increased the fluctuating asymmetry of wing shape although there was no significant correlation between the instabilities of developmental period and wing shape in general.

Inbreeding reveals stronger net selection on Drosophila melanogaster males: implications for mutation load and the fitness of sexual females,21119701,10.1038/hdy.2010.148,"Stronger selection on males has the potential to lower the deleterious mutation load of females, reducing the cost of sex. However, few studies have directly quantified the strength of selection for both sexes. As the magnitude of inbreeding depression (ID) is related to the strength of selection, we measured the cost of inbreeding for both males and females in a laboratory population of Drosophila melanogaster. Using a novel technique for inbreeding, we found significant ID for both juvenile viability and adult fitness in both sexes. The genetic variation responsible for this depression in fitness appeared to be recessive for adult fitness (h=0.11) and partially additive for juvenile viability (h=0.29). ID was identical across the sexes in terms of juvenile viability but was significantly more deleterious for males than females as adults, even though female X-chromosome homogamety should predispose them to a higher inbreeding load. We estimated the strength of selection on adult males to be 1.24 greater than on adult females, and this appears to be a consequence of selection arising from competition for mates. Combined with the generally positive intersexual genetic correlation for inbred lines, our results suggest that the mutation load of sexual females could be meaningfully reduced by stronger selection acting on males.",2011,"M A Mallet, A K Chippindale, M A Mallet, A K Chippindale"

        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      We designed an automated behavioral paradigm for efficiently dissecting visual responsiveness in Drosophila. Populations of flies walk through multiplexed serial choice mazes while being exposed to moving visuals displayed on computer monitors, and infra-red fly counters at the end of each maze automatically score the responsiveness of a strain. To test our new design, we performed a detailed comparison between wild-type flies and a learning and memory mutant, dunce(1). We first confirmed that the learning mutant dunce(1) displays increased responsiveness to a black/green moving grating compared to wild type in this new design. We then extended this result to explore responses to a wide range of psychophysical parameters for moving gratings (e.g., luminosity, contrast, spatial frequency, velocity) as well as to a different stimulus, moving dots. Finally, we combined these visuals (gratings versus dots) in competition to investigate how dunce(1) and wild-type flies respond to more complex and conflicting motion effects.

Here, we present the first quantitative study that systematically characterizes the modularity and hormone sensitivity of the interaction proteome underlying growth control by the dInR/TOR pathway. Applying quantitative affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we identified 97 high confidence protein interactions among 58 network components. In all, 22% of the detected interactions were regulated by insulin affecting membrane proximal as well as intracellular signaling complexes. Systematic functional analysis linked a subset of network components to the control of dTORC1 and dTORC2 activity. Furthermore, our data suggest the presence of three distinct dTOR kinase complexes, including the evolutionary conserved dTTT complex (Drosophila TOR, TELO2, TTI1).

The frameshift site is A_AA.A_AA.C in Caenorhabditids, fruit flies and the mosquitoes studied while a variant A_AA.A_AA.A is found in some other nematodes.

The efficiency of frameshifting varies significantly, depending on the particular stimulator within the frameshift cassette, when tested with reporter constructs in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Phylogenetic analysis of the distribution of APC programmed ribosomal frameshifting cassettes suggests it has an ancient origin and raises questions about a possibility of synthesis of alternative protein products during expression of APC in other organisms such as humans.

Recently the maternally inherited endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia has been shown to protect insects from a range of microbial and eukaryotic pathogens. Mosquitoes experimentally infected with Wolbachia have upregulated immune responses and are protected from a number of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, Plasmodium and filarial nematodes. It has been hypothesised that immune upregulation underpins Wolbachia-mediated protection. Drosophila is a strong model for understanding host-Wolbachia-pathogen interactions. Wolbachia-mediated antiviral protection in Drosophila has been demonstrated for a number of different Wolbachia strains. In this study we investigate whether Wolbachia-infected flies are also protected against pathogenic bacteria. Drosophila simulans lines infected with five different Wolbachia strains were challenged with the pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01, Serratia marcescens and Erwinia carotovora and mortality compared to paired lines without Wolbachia. No difference in mortality was observed in the flies with or without Wolbachia. Similarly no antibacterial protection was observed for D. melanogaster infected with Wolbachia. Interestingly, D. melanogaster Oregon RC flies which are naturally infected with Wolbachia showed no upregulation of the antibacterial immune genes TepIV, Defensin, Diptericin B, PGRP-SD, Cecropin A1 and Attacin D compared to paired flies without Wolbachia. Taken together these results indicate that Wolbachia-mediated antibacterial protection is not ubiquitous in insects and furthermore that the mechanisms of antibacterial and antiviral protection are independent. We suggest that the immune priming and antibacterial protection observed in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes may be a consequence of the recent artificial introduction of the symbiont into insects that normally do not carry Wolbachia and that antibacterial protection is unlikely to be found in insects carrying long-term Wolbachia infections.",2011,"Zhee Sheen Wong, Lauren M Hedges, Jeremy C Brownlie, Karyn N Johnson, Zhee Sheen Wong, Lauren M Hedges, Jeremy C Brownlie, Karyn N Johnson"
A natural genetic polymorphism affects retroactive interference in Drosophila melanogaster,20667877,10.1098/rspb.2010.1337,"As environments change, animals update their internal representations of the external world. New information about the environment is learned and retained whereas outdated information is disregarded or forgotten. Retroactive interference (RI) occurs when the retrieval of previously learned information is less available owing to the acquisition of recently acquired information. Even though RI is thought to be a major cause of forgetting, its functional significance is still under debate. We find that natural allelic variants of the Drosophila melanogaster foraging gene known to affect rover and sitter behaviour differ in RI. More specifically, rovers who were previously shown to experience greater environmental heterogeneity while foraging display RI whereas sitters do not. Rover responses are biased towards more recent learning events. These results provide an ecological context to investigate the function of forgetting via RI and a suitable genetic model organism to address the evolutionary relevance of cognitive tasks.",2011,"Christopher J Reaume, Marla B Sokolowski, Frederic Mery, Christopher J Reaume, Marla B Sokolowski, Frederic Mery"
"Drosophila UNC-45 accumulates in embryonic blastoderm and in muscles, and is essential for muscle myosin stability",21285246,10.1242/jcs.078964,"UNC-45 is a chaperone that facilitates folding of myosin motor domains. We have used Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the role of UNC-45 in muscle development and function. Drosophila UNC-45 (dUNC-45) is expressed at all developmental stages. It colocalizes with non-muscle myosin in embryonic blastoderm of 2-hour-old embryos. At 14 hours, it accumulates most strongly in embryonic striated muscles, similarly to muscle myosin. dUNC-45 localizes to the Z-discs of sarcomeres in third instar larval body-wall muscles. We produced a dunc-45 mutant in which zygotic expression is disrupted. This results in nearly undetectable dUNC-45 levels in maturing embryos as well as late embryonic lethality. Muscle myosin accumulation is robust in dunc-45 mutant embryos at 14 hours. However, myosin is dramatically decreased in the body-wall muscles of 22-hour-old mutant embryos. Furthermore, electron microscopy showed only a few thick filaments and irregular thick-thin filament lattice spacing. The lethality, defective protein accumulation, and ultrastructural abnormalities are rescued with a wild-type dunc-45 transgene, indicating that the mutant phenotypes arise from the dUNC-45 deficiency. Overall, our data indicate that dUNC-45 is important for myosin accumulation and muscle function. Furthermore, our results suggest that dUNC-45 acts post-translationally for proper myosin folding and maturation.",2011,"Chi F Lee, Girish C Melkani, Qin Yu, Jennifer A Suggs, William A Kronert, Yoko Suzuki, Lori Hipolito, Maureen G Price, Henry F Epstein, Sanford I Bernstein, Chi F Lee, Girish C Melkani, Qin Yu, Jennifer A Suggs, William A Kronert, Yoko Suzuki, Lori Hipolito, Maureen G Price, Henry F Epstein, Sanford I Bernstein"
Joint control of Drosophila male courtship behavior by motion cues and activation of male-specific P1 neurons,22645338,10.1073/pnas.1207107109,"Sexual behaviors in animals are governed by inputs from multiple external sensory modalities. However, how these inputs are integrated to jointly control animal behavior is still poorly understood. Whereas visual information alone is not sufficient to induce courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster males, when a subset of male-specific fruitless (fru)- and doublesex (dsx)-expressing neurons that respond to chemosensory cues (P1 neurons) were artificially activated via a temperature-sensitive cation channel (dTRPA1), males followed and extended their wing toward moving objects (even a moving piece of rubber band) intensively. When stationary, these objects were not courted. Our results indicate that motion input and activation of P1 neurons are individually necessary, and under our assay conditions, jointly sufficient to elicit early courtship behaviors, and provide insights into how courtship decisions are made via sensory integration.",2012,"Yufeng Pan, Geoffrey W Meissner, Bruce S Baker, Yufeng Pan, Geoffrey W Meissner, Bruce S Baker"
Taste preference for amino acids is dependent on internal nutritional state in Drosophila melanogaster,22837455,10.1242/jeb.069146,"Like mammals, insects need to ingest proteins from foods because they cannot synthesise several amino acids. Amino acids are also essential nutrients for Drosophila melanogaster, especially for female egg production, but how flies detect amino acids and how the feeding response to amino acids is regulated are unknown. In this study, the two-choice preference test, the proboscis extension reflex test and a CAFE assay were performed to explore the ability of D. melanogaster to detect and discriminate amino acids. To determine whether D. melanogaster change their feeding preference to amino acids after being deprived of them, as previously reported in the locust, two groups of flies raised on the usual medium or on glucose medium were compared. Amino-acid-deprived flies demonstrated enhanced preference to an amino acid mixture and to several amino acids. These flies ingested amino acids even when they were replete with glucose. The proboscis extension reflex to particular amino acids was induced only in amino-acid-deprived flies. Our findings indicate that the sensitivity of labellar taste cells to amino acids may change when flies are deficient in amino acid supply, and also reveal that the detection pathways for individual amino acids may differ. We suggest the existence of an amino acid receptor and a monitoring system regulating the feeding responses to amino acids.",2012,"Naoko Toshima, Teiichi Tanimura, Naoko Toshima, Teiichi Tanimura"
"The Drosophila melanogaster seminal fluid protease ""seminase"" regulates proteolytic and post-mating reproductive processes",22253601,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002435,"Proteases and protease inhibitors have been identified in the ejaculates of animal taxa ranging from invertebrates to mammals and form a major protein class among Drosophila melanogaster seminal fluid proteins (SFPs). Other than a single protease cascade in mammals that regulates seminal clot liquefaction, no proteolytic cascades (i.e. pathways with at least two proteases acting in sequence) have been identified in seminal fluids. In Drosophila, SFPs are transferred to females during mating and, together with sperm, are necessary for the many post-mating responses elicited in females. Though several SFPs are proteolytically cleaved either during or after mating, virtually nothing is known about the proteases involved in these cleavage events or the physiological consequences of proteolytic activity in the seminal fluid on the female. Here, we present evidence that a protease cascade acts in the seminal fluid of Drosophila during and after mating. Using RNAi to knock down expression of the SFP CG10586, a predicted serine protease, we show that it acts upstream of the SFP CG11864, a predicted astacin protease, to process SFPs involved in ovulation and sperm entry into storage. We also show that knockdown of CG10586 leads to lower levels of egg laying, higher rates of sexual receptivity to subsequent males, and abnormal sperm usage patterns, processes that are independent of CG11864. The long-term phenotypes of females mated to CG10586 knockdown males are similar to those of females that fail to store sex peptide, an important elicitor of long-term post-mating responses, and indicate a role for CG10586 in regulating sex peptide. These results point to an important role for proteolysis among insect SFPs and suggest that protease cascades may be a mechanism for precise temporal regulation of multiple post-mating responses in females.",2012,"Brooke A LaFlamme, K Ravi Ram, Mariana F Wolfner, Brooke A LaFlamme, K Ravi Ram, Mariana F Wolfner"
The involvement of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in methanol elimination in Drosophila melanogaster larvae,22508581,10.1002/arch.21021,"Methanol is one of the most common short-chain alcohols in fermenting fruits, the natural food of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. The larvae cope continuously with methanol at various concentrations in order to survive and develop. In the present article, we found toxicities of dietary methanol and formaldehyde were enhanced by piperonyl butoxide, but not by 3-amino-1, 2, 4-triazole, 4-methylpyrazole, diethylmeleate, and triphenyl phosphate, when assessing by the combination index method. These results reveal that cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs), rather than catalases, alcohol dehydrogenases, glutathione S-transferases, and esterases, participate in methanol metabolism. Moreover, methanol exposure dramatically increased CYP activity. The ratios of the CYP activities in treated larvae to those in control reached, respectively, up to 3.0-, 3.9-, and 2.7-fold, at methanol concentrations of 22.6, 27.9, and 34.5 mg/g diet. In addition, methanol exposure greatly up-regulated the mRNA expression level of five Cyp genes, which were Cyp304a1, Cyp9f2, Cyp28a5, Cyp4d2, and Cyp4e2. Their resulting proteins were suggested as the candidate enzymes for methanol metabolism in D. melanogaster larvae.",2012,"Shu-Ping Wang, Gui-Ling He, Rui-Rui Chen, Fei Li, Guo-Qing Li, Shu-Ping Wang, Gui-Ling He, Rui-Rui Chen, Fei Li, Guo-Qing Li"
Genome-wide association analysis of oxidative stress resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,22496853,10.1371/journal.pone.0034745,"Background:
      
    

    
      Aerobic organisms are susceptible to damage by reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress resistance is a quantitative trait with population variation attributable to the interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Drosophila melanogaster provides an ideal system to study the genetics of variation for resistance to oxidative stress.
    

    
  


        Methods and findings:
      
    

    
      We used 167 wild-derived inbred lines of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel for a genome-wide association study of acute oxidative stress resistance to two oxidizing agents, paraquat and menadione sodium bisulfite. We found significant genetic variation for both stressors. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with variation in oxidative stress resistance were often sex-specific and agent-dependent, with a small subset common for both sexes or treatments. Associated SNPs had moderately large effects, with an inverse relationship between effect size and allele frequency. Linear models with up to 12 SNPs explained 67-79% and 56-66% of the phenotypic variance for resistance to paraquat and menadione sodium bisulfite, respectively. Many genes implicated were novel with no known role in oxidative stress resistance. Bioinformatics analyses revealed a cellular network comprising DNA metabolism and neuronal development, consistent with targets of oxidative stress-inducing agents. We confirmed associations of seven candidate genes associated with natural variation in oxidative stress resistance through mutational analysis.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We identified novel candidate genes associated with variation in resistance to oxidative stress that have context-dependent effects.

Sex-biased transcriptome evolution in Drosophila,23097318,10.1093/gbe/evs093,"Sex-biased genes are thought to drive phenotypic differences between males and females. The recent availability of high-throughput gene expression data for many related species has led to a burst of investigations into the genomic and evolutionary properties of sex-biased genes. In Drosophila, a number of studies have found that X chromosomes are deficient in male-biased genes (demasculinized) and enriched for female-biased genes (feminized) and that male-biased genes evolve faster than female-biased genes. However, studies have yielded vastly different conclusions regarding the numbers of sex-biased genes and forces shaping their evolution. Here, we use RNA-seq data from multiple tissues of Drosophila melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura, a species with a recently evolved X chromosome, to explore the evolution of sex-biased genes in Drosophila. First, we compare several independent metrics for classifying sex-biased genes and find that the overlap of genes identified by different metrics is small, particularly for female-biased genes. Second, we investigate genome-wide expression patterns and uncover evidence of demasculinization and feminization of both ancestral and new X chromosomes, demonstrating that gene content on sex chromosomes evolves rapidly. Third, we examine the evolutionary rates of sex-biased genes and show that male-biased genes evolve much faster than female-biased genes, which evolve at similar rates to unbiased genes. Analysis of gene expression among tissues reveals that this trend may be partially due to pleiotropic effects of female-biased genes, which limits their evolutionary potential. Thus, our findings illustrate the importance of accurately identifying sex-biased genes and provide insight into their evolutionary dynamics in Drosophila.",2012,"Raquel Assis, Qi Zhou, Doris Bachtrog, Raquel Assis, Qi Zhou, Doris Bachtrog"
Electroretinograms in Drosophila: a robust and genetically accessible electrophysiological system for the undergraduate laboratory,23494679,,"Laboratory courses in neurophysiology fulfill a critical need for inquiry-based training in undergraduate programs in neuroscience and biology. These courses typically use classical electrophysiological preparations to explore the basic features of neuronal function. However, current neuroscience research also focuses on elucidating the molecular and genetic mechanisms of neuronal function, using model systems that include mutant and transgenic animals. To bridge laboratory training in neurophysiology with modern molecular genetics, we describe a teaching model based on electroretinography of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a long-established model system for basic neuroscience research. Drosophila are easily maintained, economical, and have hundreds of neurophysiologically relevant mutant strains and genetic tools readily available. The Drosophila electroretinogram (ERG) is a simple and accessible extracellular recording of a neural signal in the fly eye in response to flashes of light. The signal is multifaceted and the response is sensitive to stimulation parameters such as intensity, duration and wavelength, thus forming a rich source of analysis for students. Most importantly, different mutations affecting key components of intracellular signaling, synaptic transmission or neuronal function can affect the ERG waveform in characteristic ways. Recording wild type and mutant ERGs allows students to examine firsthand the connection between genetics, biochemical pathways, and electrophysiology.

Ultrastructural modifications in the mitochondria of hypoxia-adapted Drosophila melanogaster,23028948,10.1371/journal.pone.0045344,"Chronic hypoxia (CH) occurs under certain physiological or pathological conditions, including in people who reside at high altitude or suffer chronic cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases. As mitochondria are the predominant oxygen-consuming organelles to generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation in cells, their responses, through structural or molecular modifications, to limited oxygen supply play an important role in the overall functional adaptation to hypoxia. Here, we report the adaptive mitochondrial ultrastructural modifications and the functional impacts in a recently generated hypoxia-adapted Drosophila melanogaster strain that survives severe, otherwise lethal, hypoxic conditions. Using electron tomography, we discovered increased mitochondrial volume density and cristae abundance, yet also cristae fragmentation and a unique honeycomb-like structure in the mitochondria of hypoxia-adapted flies. The homeostatic levels of adenylate and energy charge were similar between hypoxia-adapted and naÃ¯ve control flies and the hypoxia-adapted flies remained active under severe hypoxia as quantified by negative geotaxis behavior. The equilibrium ATP level was lower in hypoxia-adapted flies than those of the naÃ¯ve controls tested under severe hypoxia that inhibited the motion of control flies.

Pickpocket1 is an ionotropic molecular sensory transducer,23033486,10.1074/jbc.M112.411736,"The molecular transformation of an external stimulus into changes in sensory neuron activity is incompletely described. Although a number of molecules have been identified that can respond to stimuli, evidence that these molecules can transduce stimulation into useful neural activity is lacking. Here we demonstrate that pickpocket1 (ppk1), a Drosophila homolog of mammalian Degenerin/epithelial sodium channels, encodes an acid-sensing sodium channel that conducts a transient depolarizing current in multidendritic sensory neurons of Drosophila melanogaster. Stimulation of Ppk1 is sufficient to bring these sensory neurons to threshold, eliciting a burst of action potentials. The transient nature of the neural activity produced by Ppk1 activation is the result of Ppk1 channel gating properties. This model is supported by the observation of enhanced bursting activity in neurons expressing a gain of function ppk1 mutant harboring the degenerin mutation. These findings demonstrate that Ppk1 can function as an ionotropic molecular sensory transducer capable of transforming the perception of a stimulus into phasic neuronal activity in sensory neurons.",2012,"Nina Boiko, Volodymyr Kucher, James D Stockand, Benjamin A Eaton, Nina Boiko, Volodymyr Kucher, James D Stockand, Benjamin A Eaton"
ALS-linked SOD1 in glial cells enhances ?-N-Methylamino L-Alanine (BMAA)-induced toxicity in Drosophila,24627764,10.12688/f1000research.1-47.v1,"Environmental factors have been implicated in the etiology of a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the role of environmental agents in ALS remains poorly understood. To this end, we used transgenic fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to explore the interaction between mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and chemicals such as ?-N-methylamino L-alanine (BMAA), the herbicide agent paraquat, and superoxide species. We expressed ALS-linked human SOD1 (hSOD1A4V, and hSOD1G85R), hSOD1wt as well as the Drosophila native SOD1 (dSOD1) in motoneurons (MNs) or in glial cells alone and simultaneously in both types of cells. We then examined the effect of BMAA (3 mM), paraquat (20 mM), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 1%) on the lifespan of SOD1-expressing flies. Our data show that glial expression of mutant and wild type hSOD1s reduces the ability of flies to climb. Further, we show that while all three chemicals significantly shorten the lifespan of flies, mutant SOD1 does not have a significant additional effect on the lifespan of flies fed on paraquat, but further shortens the lifespan of flies fed on H2O2. Finally, we show that BMAA shows a dramatic cell-type specific effect with mutant SOD1. Flies with expression of mutant hSOD1 in MNs survived longer on BMAA compared to control flies. In contrast, BMAA significantly shortened the lifespan of flies expressing mutant hSOD1 in glia. Consistent with a neuronal protection role, flies expressing these mutant hSOD1s in both MNs and glia also lived longer. Hence, our studies reveal a synergistic effect of mutant SOD1 with H2O2 and novel roles for mutant hSOD1s in neurons to reduce BMAA toxicity and in glia to enhance the toxicity of BMAA in flies.",2012,"Rafique Islam, Emily L Kumimoto, Hong Bao, Bing Zhang, Rafique Islam, Emily L Kumimoto, Hong Bao, Bing Zhang"

The GFP::RpL10A fusion protein incorporates efficiently into ribosomes and polysomes.

Survival of heat stress with and without heat hardening in Drosophila melanogaster: interactions with larval density,22675182,10.1242/jeb.069831,"Survival of a potentially lethal high temperature stress is a genetically variable thermal adaptation trait in many organisms.

Mapping populations were two panels of recombinant inbred lines (RIL), which were previously constructed from heat stress-selected stocks: RIL-D48 and RIL-SH2, derived from backcrosses to stocks of low and high heat resistance, respectively. HSS increased with heat hardening in both LD and HD flies. In addition, HSS increased consistently with density in non-hardened flies. There was a significant interaction between heat hardening and density effects in RIL-D48. Several QTL were significant for both density and hardening treatments. Many QTL overlapped with thermotolerance QTL identified for other traits in previous studies based on LD cultures only. However, three new QTL were found in HD only (cytological ranges: 12E-16F6; 30A3-34C2; 49C-50C).

Evolution of reproductive isolation as a by-product of divergent life-history evolution in laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster,23301185,10.1002/ece3.413,"We show that two complementary asymmetric isolating mechanisms, likely mediated by divergence in body size, underlie the evolution of incipient reproductive isolation between a set of Drosophila melanogaster populations selected for rapid development and their ancestral controls. Selection has led to great reduction in body size in the fast developing lines. Small males belonging to fast developing lines obtain few matings with large control females, both in presence and absence of large control line males, giving rise to unidirectional, premating isolation caused by sexual selection. Conversely, small selected line females suffer greatly increased mortality following mating with large control males, causing unidirectional postcopulatory prezygotic isolation. We discuss preliminary evidence for evolution of reduced male harm caused to females upon mating in the fast developing lines, and speculate that the females from these lines have coevolved reduced resistance to male harm such that they can no longer resist the harm caused by males from control lines. This potentially implicates differing levels of sexual conflict in creating reproductive barrier between the selected line females and the control males. We also show that a large difference in development time is not sufficient to cause postzygotic incompatibilities in the two sets of populations reaffirming the belief that prezygotic isolation can evolve much earlier than postzygotic isolation.",2012,"Shampa M Ghosh, Amitabh Joshi, Shampa M Ghosh, Amitabh Joshi"

This protein containing the thioredoxin-like domain resided in the endoplasmic reticulum and seemed to be expressed ubiquitously throughout the development of Drosophila. DmCaBP1 was externalized without truncation after the induction of apoptosis somewhat prior to chromatin condensation and DNA cleavage in a manner dependent on the activity of caspases. A recombinant DmCaBP1 protein bound to both apoptotic cells and a hemocyte-derived cell line expressing Draper. Forced expression of DmCaBP1 at the cell surface made non-apoptotic cells susceptible to phagocytosis. Flies deficient in DmCaBP1 expression developed normally and showed Draper-mediated pruning of larval axons, but a defect in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in embryos was observed. Loss of Pretaporter, a previously identified ligand for Draper, did not cause a further decrease in the level of phagocytosis in DmCaBP1-lacking embryos.

Genetic variation in odorant receptors contributes to variation in olfactory behavior in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster,22038943,10.1093/chemse/bjr097,"Chemoreception is a principle modality by which organisms gain information from their environment, and extensive variation in odor-mediated behavior has been documented within and among species. To examine the mechanisms by which sensory systems mediate these responses, we ask to what extent variation in Drosophila melanogaster odorant receptor genes contributes to variation in odor-mediated behavior. Significant differences in behavioral responses to structurally similar odorants, methyl hexanoate and ethyl hexanoate, were found in a natural population. Polymorphisms in 3 genomic regions (Or22a/Or22b, Or35a, and Or47a) were identified and associated with variation in behavior to these esters. Overall similarity in association profiles for both odorants was observed, except for Or47a in which polymorphisms were associated solely with variation in responses to ethyl hexanoate. Our analyses were then extended to examine polymorphisms in 3 odorant receptors previously reported to contribute to variation in olfactory behavior for the chemically distinct odorants benzaldehyde and acetophenone. Two Or10a polymorphisms were associated with variation in response to ethyl hexanoate. Finally, differences in Or35a and Or47a expression were associated with variation in responses to ethyl hexanoate.

The many landscapes of recombination in Drosophila melanogaster,23071443,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002905,"Recombination is a fundamental biological process with profound evolutionary implications. Theory predicts that recombination increases the effectiveness of selection in natural populations.

The use of imprecise recombination rates can also skew population genetic analyses designed to assess the presence and mode of selection across genomes. Here we report the first integrated high-resolution description of genomic and population variation in recombination, which also distinguishes between the two outcomes of meiotic recombination: crossing over (CO) and gene conversion (GC). We characterized the products of 5,860 female meioses in Drosophila melanogaster by genotyping a total of 139 million informative SNPs and mapped 106,964 recombination events at a resolution down to 2 kilobases. This approach allowed us to generate whole-genome CO and GC maps as well as a detailed description of variation in recombination among individuals of this species. We describe many levels of variation in recombination rates. At a large-scale (100 kb), CO rates exhibit extreme and highly punctuated variation along chromosomes, with hot and coldspots. We also show extensive intra-specific variation in CO landscapes that is associated with hotspots at low frequency in our sample. GC rates are more uniformly distributed across the genome than CO rates and detectable in regions with reduced or absent CO. At a local scale, recombination events are associated with numerous sequence motifs and tend to occur within transcript regions, thus suggesting that chromatin accessibility favors double-strand breaks. All these non-independent layers of variation in recombination across genomes and among individuals need to be taken into account in order to obtain relevant estimates of recombination rates, and should be included in a new generation of population genetic models of the interaction between selection and linkage.",2012,"Josep M Comeron, Ramesh Ratnappan, Samuel Bailin, Josep M Comeron, Ramesh Ratnappan, Samuel Bailin"
Courtship song analysis of Drosophila muscle mutants,21945578,10.1016/j.ymeth.2011.09.007,"As part of the mating ritual, males of Drosophila species produce species-specific courtship songs through wing vibrations generated by the thoracic musculature. While previous studies have shown that indirect flight muscles (IFM) are neurally activated during courtship song production, the precise role of these muscles in song production has not been investigated. Fortunately, IFM mutants abound in Drosophila melanogaster and studies spanning several decades have shed light on the role of muscle proteins in IFM-powered flight. Analysis of courtship songs in these mutants offers the opportunity to uncover the role of the IFM in a behavior distinct than flight and subject to different evolutionary selection regimes. Here, we describe protocols for the recording and analysis of courtship behavior and mating song of D. melanogaster muscle transgenic and mutant strains. To record faint acoustic signal of courtship songs, an insulated mating compartment was used inside a recording device (INSECTAVOX) equipped with a modified electret microphone, a low-noise power supply, and noise filters. Songs recorded in the INSECTAVOX are digitized using Goldwave, whose several features enable extraction of critical song parameters, including carrier frequencies for pulse song and sine song. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by showing that deletion of the N-terminal region of the myosin regulatory light chain, a mutation known to decrease wing beat frequency and flight power, affects courtship song parameters.",2012,"Samya Chakravorty, Mathew P Wajda, Jim O Vigoreaux, Samya Chakravorty, Mathew P Wajda, Jim O Vigoreaux"

Sexual selection is ineffectual or inhibits the purging of deleterious mutations in Drosophila melanogaster,22759290,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01584.x,"The effects of sexual selection on population mean fitness are unclear and a subject of debate. Recent models propose that, because reproductive success may be condition dependent, much of the genome may be a target of sexual selection. Under this scenario, mutations that reduce health, and thus nonsexual fitness, may also be deleterious with respect to reproductive success, meaning that sexual selection may contribute to the purging of deleterious alleles. We tested this hypothesis directly by subjecting replicate Drosophila melanogaster populations to two treatments that altered the opportunity for sexual selection and then tracked changes in the frequency of six separate deleterious alleles with recessive and visible phenotypic effects. While natural selection acted to decrease the frequency of all six mutations, the addition of sexual selection did not aid in the purging of any of them, and for three of them appears to have hampered it. Courtship and mating have harmful effects in this species and mate choice assays showed that males directed more courtship and mating behavior toward wild-type over mutant females, providing a likely explanation for sexual selection's cost. Whether this cost extends to other mutations (e.g., those lacking visible phenotypic effects) is an important topic for future research.",2012,"Devin Arbuthnott, Howard D Rundle, Devin Arbuthnott, Howard D Rundle"
Essential roles of the Tap42-regulated protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) family in wing imaginal disc development of Drosophila melanogaster,22701670,10.1371/journal.pone.0038569,"Protein ser/thr phosphatase 2A family members (PP2A, PP4, and PP6) are implicated in the control of numerous biological processes, but our understanding of the in vivo function and regulation of these enzymes is limited. In this study, we investigated the role of Tap42, a common regulatory subunit for all three PP2A family members, in the development of Drosophila melanogaster wing imaginal discs. RNAi-mediated silencing of Tap42 using the binary Gal4/UAS system and two disc drivers, pnr- and ap-Gal4, not only decreased survival rates but also hampered the development of wing discs, resulting in a remarkable thorax cleft and defective wings in adults. Silencing of Tap42 also altered multiple signaling pathways (HH, JNK and DPP) and triggered apoptosis in wing imaginal discs. The Tap42(RNAi)-induced defects were the direct result of loss of regulation of Drosophila PP2A family members (MTS, PP4, and PPV), as enforced expression of wild type Tap42, but not a phosphatase binding defective Tap42 mutant, rescued fly survivorship and defects.

Little evidence for demasculinization of the Drosophila X chromosome among genes expressed in the male germline,22975718,10.1093/gbe/evs077,"Male-biased genes-those expressed at higher levels in males than in females-are underrepresented on the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster. Several evolutionary models have been posited to explain this so-called demasculinization of the X. Here, we show that the apparent paucity of male-biased genes on the X chromosome is attributable to global X-autosome differences in expression in Drosophila testes, owing to a lack of sex chromosome dosage compensation in the male germline, but not to any difference in the density of testis-specific or testis-biased genes on the X chromosome. First, using genome-wide gene expression data from 20 tissues, we find no evidence that genes with testis-specific expression are underrepresented on the X chromosome. Second, using contrasts in gene expression profiles among pairs of tissues, we recover a statistical underrepresentation of testis-biased genes on the X but find that the pattern largely disappears once we account for the lack of dosage compensation in the Drosophila male germline. Third, we find that computationally ""demasculinizing"" the autosomes is not sufficient to produce an expression profile similar to that of the X chromosome in the testes. Our findings thus show that the lack of sex chromosome dosage compensation in Drosophila testes can explain the apparent signal of demasculinization on the X, whereas evolutionary demasculinization of the X cannot explain its overall reduced expression in the testes.",2012,"Colin D Meiklejohn, Daven C Presgraves, Colin D Meiklejohn, Daven C Presgraves"

Genome-wide patterns of latitudinal differentiation among populations of Drosophila melanogaster from North America,22913798,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05731.x,"Understanding the genetic underpinnings of adaptive change is a fundamental but largely unresolved problem in evolutionary biology. Drosophila melanogaster, an ancestrally tropical insect that has spread to temperate regions and become cosmopolitan, offers a powerful opportunity for identifying the molecular polymorphisms underlying clinal adaptation. Here, we use genome-wide next-generation sequencing of DNA pools ('pool-seq') from three populations collected along the North American east coast to examine patterns of latitudinal differentiation. Comparing the genomes of these populations is particularly interesting since they exhibit clinal variation in a number of important life history traits. We find extensive latitudinal differentiation, with many of the most strongly differentiated genes involved in major functional pathways such as the insulin/TOR, ecdysone, torso, EGFR, TGFÎ²/BMP, JAK/STAT, immunity and circadian rhythm pathways. We observe particularly strong differentiation on chromosome 3R, especially within the cosmopolitan inversion In(3R)Payne, which contains a large number of clinally varying genes. While much of the differentiation might be driven by clinal differences in the frequency of In(3R)P, we also identify genes that are likely independent of this inversion.

The Drosophila melanogaster hsp22 gene, which has been extensively reviewed as being sensitive to different changing life conditions, was examined by qRT-PCR, using carboxy-X-rhodamine. In the present study, we focused on the detection of hsp22 level of transcription in three D. melanogaster isolates, collected from sites located near different chemical plants in Romania and subjected to one-year adaptation to laboratory conditions. In all isolates, the hsp22 gene expression was determined using the housekeeping genes Gapdh1 and UbcD10 as internal controls. According to our experimental results, the D. melanogaster hsp22 gene was significantly downregulated compared to the same gene in w(1118)iso, used as a calibrator.

Mink1 regulates Î²-catenin-independent Wnt signaling via Prickle phosphorylation,22037766,10.1128/MCB.06320-11,"Î²-Catenin-independent Wnt signaling pathways have been implicated in the regulation of planar cell polarity (PCP) and convergent extension (CE) cell movements.

Using mass spectrometry, we have identified the Ste20 kinase Mink1 as a Prickle-associated protein and found that they genetically interact during the establishment of PCP in the Drosophila eye and CE in Xenopus laevis embryos. We show that Mink1 phosphorylates Prickle on a conserved threonine residue and regulates its Rab5-dependent endosomal trafficking, a process required for the localized plasma membrane accumulation and function of Prickle.

      To investigate antioxidant activities and life span prolonging effects of the extracts from the roots of Incarvillea younghusbandii Sprague, and to study the correlations between these activities and the polar intensity of the extracts.
    

    
  


        Method:
      
    

    
      Five extracts (IYS1, IYS2, IYS3, IYS4 and YS5) with different polar intensity were prepared. Antioxidant activities in vitro were determined by LPO inhibitory and free radicals scavenging experiments. Life span prolonging effects in vivo were evaluated by feeding Drosophila melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Result:
      
    

    
      Total phenolic content in extracts were solvent-dependent and decreased in the order of IYS4 > IYS1 >> IYS3 > IYS5 > IYS2. Organic extracts (IYS1 and IYS4) showed excellent LPO inhibitory activity, O(2)(Â· -) and Â·OH scavenging activity compared to ascorbic acid (or benzoic acid, or BHT), while aqueous extracts (IYS2, IYS3 and IYS5) did not. The antioxidant activities (in vitro) were solvent dependent and decreased in the order of IYS4 > IYS1 > IYS3 > IYS5 ??IYS2. Drosophila melanogaster was fed with organic extracts (IYS1 or IYS4) at 5.0 mg mL(-1). The mean life span were increased by 24.4% (IYS1) or 23.0% (IYS4) in female and 15.3% (IYS1) or 16.9% (IYS4) in male; the maximum life span were increased by 8.4% (IYS1) or 11.2% (IYS4) in female and 9.7% (IYS1) or 15.8% (IYS4) in male, and the survival curves were significantly shifted to the right after fifteen days in both sexes survival period. Feeding aqueous extracts (IYS2, IYS3 or IYS5) at 5.0 mgÂ·mL(-1), the significant life span prolonging effects were not achieved.

The MYST-containing protein Chameau is required for proper sensory organ specification during Drosophila thorax morphogenesis,22412942,10.1371/journal.pone.0032882,"The adult thorax of Drosophila melanogaster is covered by a stereotyped pattern of mechanosensory bristles called macrochaetes.

Chm mutant pupae present extra-dorsocentral (DC) and scutellar (SC) macrochaetes, but a normal number of the other macrochaetes. We provide evidences that chm restricts the singling out of sensory organ precursors from proneural clusters and genetically interacts with transcriptional regulators involved in the regulation of achaete and scute in the DC and SC proneural cluster. This function of chm likely relies on chromatin structure regulation since a protein with a mutation in the conserved catalytic site fails to rescue the formation of supernumerary DC and SC bristles in chm mutant flies. This is further supported by the finding that mutations in genes encoding chromatin modifiers and remodeling factors, including Polycomb group (PcG) and Trithorax group (TrxG) members, dominantly modulate the penetrance of chm extra bristle phenotype.

The ability to entrain to long photoperiods differs between 3 Drosophila melanogaster wild-type strains and is modified by twilight simulation,22306972,10.1177/0748730411420246,"The ability to adapt to different environmental conditions including seasonal changes is a key feature of the circadian clock.

Fruit flies are predominantly crepuscular with activity bouts in the morning (M) and evening (E). The M peak follows dawn and the E peak follows dusk when the photoperiod is extended. We show that this ability is restricted to a certain extension of the phase angle between M and E peaks, such that the E peak does not delay beyond a certain phase under long days. We demonstrate that this ability is significantly improved by simulated twilight and that it depends additionally on the genetic background and the ambient temperature. At 20 Â°C, the laboratory strain CantonS had the most flexible phase angle between M and E peaks, a Northern wild-type strain had an intermediate one, and a Southern wild-type strain had the lowest flexibility.

Characterization of Drosophila GDNF receptor-like and evidence for its evolutionarily conserved interaction with neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)/FasII,23284846,10.1371/journal.pone.0051997,"Background:
      
    

    
      Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands are secreted growth factors distantly related to the TGF-Î² superfamily. In mammals, they bind to the GDNF family receptor Î± (GfrÎ±) and signal through the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase. In order to gain insight into the evolution of the Ret-Gfr-Gdnf signaling system, we have cloned and characterized the first invertebrate Gfr-like cDNA (DmGfrl) from Drosophila melanogaster and generated a DmGfrl mutant allele.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We found that DmGfrl encodes a large GPI-anchored membrane protein with four GFR-like domains. In line with the fact that insects lack GDNF ligands, DmGfrl mediated neither Drosophila Ret phosphorylation nor mammalian RET phosphorylation. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that DmGfrl is expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems throughout Drosophila development, but, surprisingly, DmGfrl and DmRet expression patterns were largely non-overlapping. We generated a DmGfrl null allele by genomic FLP deletion and found that both DmGfrl null females and males are viable but display fertility defects. The female fertility defect manifested as dorsal appendage malformation, small size and reduced viability of eggs laid by mutant females. In male flies DmGfrl interacted genetically with the Drosophila Ncam (neural cell adhesion molecule) homolog FasII to regulate fertility.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our results suggest that Ret and Gfrl did not function as an in cis receptor-coreceptor pair before the emergence of GDNF family ligands, and that the Ncam-Gfr interaction predated the in cis Ret-Gfr interaction in evolution. The fertility defects that we describe in DmGfrl null flies suggest that GDNF receptor-like has an evolutionarily ancient role in regulating male fertility and a previously unrecognized role in regulating oogenesis.

Genetic basis for developmental homeostasis of germline stem cell niche number: a network of Tramtrack-Group nuclear BTB factors,23185495,10.1371/journal.pone.0049958,"The potential to produce new cells during adult life depends on the number of stem cell niches and the capacity of stem cells to divide, and is therefore under the control of programs ensuring developmental homeostasis. However, it remains generally unknown how the number of stem cell niches is controlled. In the insect ovary, each germline stem cell (GSC) niche is embedded in a functional unit called an ovariole. The number of ovarioles, and thus the number of GSC niches, varies widely among species. In Drosophila, morphogenesis of ovarioles starts in larvae with the formation of terminal filaments (TFs), each made of 8-10 cells that pile up and sort in stacks. TFs constitute organizers of individual germline stem cell niches during larval and early pupal development. In the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup, the number of ovarioles varies interspecifically from 8 to 20. Here we show that pipsqueak, Trithorax-like, batman and the bric-?-brac (bab) locus, all encoding nuclear BTB/POZ factors of the Tramtrack Group, are involved in limiting the number of ovarioles in D. melanogaster. At least two different processes are differentially perturbed by reducing the function of these genes. We found that when the bab dose is reduced, sorting of TF cells into TFs was affected such that each TF contains fewer cells and more TFs are formed.

Balancing crosstalk between 20-hydroxyecdysone-induced autophagy and caspase activity in the fat body during Drosophila larval-prepupal transition,24036278,10.1016/j.ibmb.2013.09.001,"In the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, autophagy and caspase activity function in parallel in the salivary gland during metamorphosis and in a common regulatory hierarchy during oogenesis. Both autophagy and caspase activity progressively increase in the remodeling fat body, and they are induced by a pulse of the molting hormone (20-hydroxyecdysone, 20E) during the larval-prepupal transition. Inhibition of autophagy and/or caspase activity in the remodeling fat body results in 25-40% pupal lethality, depending on the genotypes. Interestingly, a balancing crosstalk occurs between autophagy and caspase activity in this tissue: the inhibition of autophagy induces caspase activity and the inhibition of caspases induces autophagy. The Drosophila remodeling fat body provides an in vivo model for understanding the molecular mechanism of the balancing crosstalk between autophagy and caspase activity, which oppose with each other and are induced by the common stimulus 20E, and blockage of either path reinforces the other path.",2013,"Hanhan Liu, Qiangqiang Jia, Gianluca Tettamanti, Sheng Li, Hanhan Liu, Qiangqiang Jia, Gianluca Tettamanti, Sheng Li"
Female mediation of competitive fertilization success in Drosophila melanogaster,23757499,10.1073/pnas.1300954110,"How females store and use sperm after remating can generate postcopulatory sexual selection on male ejaculate traits. Variation in ejaculate performance traits generally is thought to be intrinsic to males but is likely to interact with the environment in which sperm compete (e.g., the female reproductive tract). Our understanding of female contributions to competitive fertilization success is limited, however, in part because of the challenges involved in observing events within the reproductive tract of internally fertilizing species while discriminating among sperm from competing males. Here, we used females from crosses among isogenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster, each mated to two genetically standardized males (the first with green- and the second with red-tagged sperm heads) to demonstrate heritable variation in female remating interval, progeny production rate, sperm-storage organ morphology, and a number of sperm performance, storage, and handling traits. We then used multivariate analyses to examine relationships between this female-mediated variation and competitive paternity. In particular, the timing of female ejection of excess second-male and displaced first-male sperm was genetically variable and, by terminating the process of sperm displacement, significantly influenced the relative numbers of sperm from each male competing for fertilization, and consequently biased paternity. Our results demonstrate that females do not simply provide a static arena for sperm competition but rather play an active and pivotal role in postcopulatory processes. Resolving the adaptive significance of genetic variation in female-mediated mechanisms of sperm handling is critical for understanding sexual selection, sexual conflict, and the coevolution of male and female reproductive traits.",2013,"Stefan LÃ¼pold, Scott Pitnick, Kirstin S Berben, Cecilia S Blengini, John M Belote, Mollie K Manier, Stefan LÃ¼pold, Scott Pitnick, Kirstin S Berben, Cecilia S Blengini, John M Belote, Mollie K Manier"
Nucleolar stress in Drosophila melanogaster: RNAi-mediated depletion of Nopp140,23412656,10.4161/nucl.23944,"Nucleolar stress results when ribosome biogenesis is disrupted. An excellent example is the human Treacher Collins syndrome in which the loss of the nucleolar chaperone, Treacle, leads to p53-dependent apoptosis in embryonic neural crest cells and ultimately to craniofacial birth defects. Here, we show that depletion of the related nucleolar phosphoprotein, Nopp140, in Drosophila melanogaster led to nucleolar stress and eventual lethality when multiple tissues were depleted of Nopp140. We used TEM, immuno-blot analysis and metabolic protein labeling to show the loss of ribosomes. Targeted loss of Nopp140 in larval wing discs caused Caspase-dependent apoptosis which eventually led to defects in the adult wings. These defects were not rescued by a p53 gene deletion, as the craniofacial defects were in the murine model of TCS, thus suggesting that apoptosis caused by nucleolar stress in Drosophila is induced by a p53-independent mechanism. Loss of Nopp140 in larval polyploid midgut cells induced premature autophagy as marked by the accumulation of mCherry-ATG8a into autophagic vesicles. We also found elevated phenoloxidase A3 levels in whole larval lysates and within the hemolymph of Nopp140-depleted larvae vs. hemolymph from parental genotype larvae. Phenoloxidase A3 enrichment was coincident with the appearance of melanotic tumors in the Nopp140-depleted larvae. The occurrence of apoptosis, autophagy and phenoloxidase A3 release to the hemolymph upon nucleolar stress correlated well with the demonstrated activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in Nopp140-depleted larvae. We propose that JNK is a central stress response effector that is activated by nucleolar stress in Drosophila larvae.",2013,"Allison James, Renford Cindass Jr, Dana Mayer, Stephanie Terhoeve, Courtney Mumphrey, Patrick DiMario, Allison James, Renford Cindass Jr, Dana Mayer, Stephanie Terhoeve, Courtney Mumphrey, Patrick DiMario"

Food deprivation increases the low-dose locomotor stimulant response to ethanol in Drosophila melanogaster,23994621,10.1016/j.pbb.2013.08.010,"Acute and chronic states of food deprivation result in increased sensitivity to a variety of natural reinforcers as well as to drugs of abuse. Food deprived animals show increased locomotor activity during periods of food deprivation, as well as increased locomotor stimulant responses to drugs of abuse, including cocaine, amphetamine, morphine, and ethanol, implying that drugs of abuse act in part on neural systems that underlie responses towards food. To determine whether this effect extends to an invertebrate, highly genetically tractable animal, the locomotor stimulant effects of low dose ethanol were assessed under a variety of feeding conditions in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Food deprivation resulted in strain specific increases in ethanol-stimulated locomotor activity in most strains tested, although elevated baseline activity confounded interpretation in some strains. Experiments conducted with Canton S flies found that the effects of food deprivation on the locomotor stimulant response to ethanol increased with the duration of deprivation, and could be blocked by refeeding the flies with standard food or sucrose, but not yeast, immediately prior to the ethanol exposure. Life-span extending dietary depletion procedures or previous periods of food deprivation did not affect the response to ethanol, indicating that only animals in an acutely food deprived state are more sensitive to the stimulant effects of ethanol. These results suggest that increased sensitivity to the stimulant effects of some drugs of abuse might reflect an evolutionarily conserved neural mechanism that underlies behavioral responses to natural reinforcers and drugs of abuse. The identification of this mechanism, and the genes that underlie its development and function, will constitute a novel approach towards the study of alcohol abuse and dependence.",2013,"Christopher L Kliethermes, Christopher L Kliethermes"
Drosophila immune priming against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is short-lasting and depends on cellular and humoral immunity,24358857,10.12688/f1000research.2-76.v1,"Immune responses are traditionally divided into the innate and the adaptive arm, both of which are present in vertebrates, while only the innate arm is found in invertebrates. Immune priming experiments in Drosophila melanogaster and other invertebrates during the last decade have challenged this dogma, questioning the boundaries between innate and adaptive immunity. Studies on repeated inoculation of Drosophila with microbes reveal a long-lasting cellular immunity adaptation against particular microorganisms. Here we study the lasting effect of immune priming against infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen that is lethal to the common fruit fly. Drosophila priming with heat-killed or low in virulence P. aeruginosa extends fly survival during a secondary lethal infection with a virulent strain of the same species. The protective immune response can last for more than 10 days after exposure to a persistent low-in-virulence live infection, but it is eliminated 7 days after the host is primed with heat-killed bacteria. Moreover, not only the cellular, but also the systemic NF-ÎºB-mediated immune responses contribute to immune priming.

We therefore investigated during in vitro murine myogenesis a mammalian homolog, Kirrel, of the Drosophila Melanogaster genes Roughest (Rst) and Kin of Irre (Kirre) which regulate somatic muscle cell fusion during embryonic development. Our results demonstrate the presence of a novel murine Kirrel isoform containing a truncated cytoplasmic domain which we term Kirrel B. Protein expression levels of Kirrel B are inverse to the occurrence of cell fusion events during in vitro myogenesis which is in stark contrast to the expression profile of Rst and Kirre during myogenesis in Drosophila. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of cell fusion confirmed the inverse expression pattern of Kirrel B protein levels in relation to cell fusion events. The discovery of a novel Kirrel B protein isoform during myogenesis highlights the need for more thorough investigation of the similarities and potential differences between fly and mammals with regards to the muscle cell fusion process.",2013,"Peter J Durcan, Nasser Al-Shanti, Claire E Stewart, Peter J Durcan, Nasser Al-Shanti, Claire E Stewart"
"Fermitins, the orthologs of mammalian Kindlins, regulate the development of a functional cardiac syncytium in Drosophila melanogaster",23690969,10.1371/journal.pone.0062958,"The vertebrate Kindlins are an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins critical for integrin signalling and cell adhesion. Kindlin-2 (KIND2) is associated with intercalated discs in mice, suggesting a role in cardiac syncytium development; however, deficiency of Kind2 leads to embryonic lethality. Morpholino knock-down of Kind2 in zebrafish has a pleiotropic effect on development that includes the heart. It therefore remains unclear whether cardiomyocyte Kind2 expression is required for cardiomyocyte junction formation and the development of normal cardiac function. To address this question, the expression of Fermitin 1 and Fermitin 2 (Fit1, Fit2), the two Drosophila orthologs of Kind2, was silenced in Drosophila cardiomyocytes. Heart development was assessed in adult flies by immunological methods and videomicroscopy. Silencing both Fit1 and Fit2 led to a severe cardiomyopathy characterised by the failure of cardiomyocytes to develop as a functional syncytium and loss of synchrony between cardiomyocytes. A null allele of Fit1 was generated but this had no impact on the heart. Similarly, the silencing of Fit2 failed to affect heart function. In contrast, the silencing of Fit2 in the cardiomyocytes of Fit1 null flies disrupted syncytium development, leading to severe cardiomyopathy. The data definitively demonstrate a role for Fermitins in the development of a functional cardiac syncytium in Drosophila. The findings also show that the Fermitins can functionally compensate for each other in order to control syncytium development. These findings support the concept that abnormalities in cardiomyocyte KIND2 expression or function may contribute to cardiomyopathies in humans.",2013,"James H Catterson, Margarete M S Heck, Paul S Hartley, James H Catterson, Margarete M S Heck, Paul S Hartley"
Pigmentation and behavior: potential association through pleiotropic genes in Drosophila,24025245,10.1266/ggs.88.165,"The molecular basis of pigmentation variation within and among Drosophila species is largely attributed to genes in melanin biosynthesis pathway, which involves dopamine metabolism.

Within D. melanogaster, changes in cis-regulatory regions of a gene, ebony, are responsible for the naturally occurring variation of the body pigmentation intensity. This gene is also known to be expressed in glia, and many visual and behavioral abnormalities of its mutants have been reported. This implies that the gene has pleiotropic functions in the nervous systems. In this review, current knowledge on pigmentation variation and melanin biosynthesis pathway are summarized, with some focus on pleiotropic features of ebony and other genes in the pathway.

Mutations to the piRNA pathway component aubergine enhance meiotic drive of segregation distorter in Drosophila melanogaster,23267055,10.1534/genetics.112.147561,"Diploid sexual reproduction involves segregation of allelic pairs, ensuring equal representation of genotypes in the gamete pool. Some genes, however, are able to ""cheat"" the system by promoting their own transmission. The Segregation distorter (Sd) locus in Drosophila melanogaster males is one of the best-studied examples of this type of phenomenon. In this system the presence of Sd on one copy of chromosome 2 results in dysfunction of the non-Sd-bearing (Sd(+)) sperm and almost exclusive transmission of Sd to the next generation. The mechanism by which Sd wreaks such selective havoc has remained elusive. However, its effect requires a target locus on chromosome 2 known as Responder (Rsp). The Rsp locus comprises repeated copies of a satellite DNA sequence and Rsp copy number correlates with sensitivity to Sd. Under distorting conditions during spermatogenesis, nuclei with chromosomes containing greater than several hundred Rsp repeats fail to condense chromatin and are eliminated. Recently, Rsp sequences were found as small RNAs in association with Argonaute family proteins Aubergine (Aub) and Argonaute3 (AGO3). These proteins are involved in a germline-specific RNAi mechanism known as the Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, which specifically suppresses transposon activation in the germline. Here, we evaluate the role of piRNAs in segregation distortion by testing the effects of mutations to piRNA pathway components on distortion. Further, we specifically targeted mutations to the aub locus of a Segregation Distorter (SD) chromosome, using ends-out homologous recombination.

Drosophila embryonic cell-cycle mutants,23979936,10.1534/g3.113.007880,"Nearly all cell division mutants in Drosophila were recovered in late larval/pupal lethal screens, with less than 10 embryonic lethal mutants identified, because larval development occurs without a requirement for cell division. Only cells in the nervous system and the imaginal cells that generate the adult body divide during larval stages, with larval tissues growing by increasing ploidy rather than cell number. Thus, most mutants perturbing mitosis or the cell cycle do not manifest a phenotype until the adult body differentiates in late larval and pupal stages. To identify cell-cycle components whose maternal pools are depleted in embryogenesis or that have specific functions in embryogenesis, we screened for mutants defective in cell division during embryogenesis. Five new alleles of Cyclin E were recovered, ranging from a missense mutation that is viable to stop codons causing embryonic lethality. These permitted us to investigate the requirements for Cyclin E function in neuroblast cell fate determination, a role previously shown for a null Cyclin E allele. The mutations causing truncation of the protein affect cell fate of the NB6-4 neuroblast, whereas the weak missense mutation has no effect. We identified mutations in the pavarotti (pav) and tumbleweed (tum) genes needed for cytokinesis by a phenotype of large and multinucleate cells in the embryonic epidermis and nervous system.

Drosophila melanogaster muscle LIM protein and alpha-actinin function together to stabilize muscle cytoarchitecture: a potential role for Mlp84B in actin-crosslinking,23606669,10.1002/cm.21106,"Stabilization of tissue architecture during development and growth is essential to maintain structural integrity. Because of its contractile nature, muscle is especially susceptible to physiological stresses, and has multiple mechanisms to maintain structural integrity. The Drosophila melanogaster Muscle LIM Protein (MLP), Mlp84B, participates in muscle maintenance, yet its precise mechanism of action is still controversial. Through a candidate approach, we identified Î±-actinin as a protein that functions with Mlp84B to ensure muscle integrity. Î±-actinin RNAi animals die primarily as pupae, and Mlp84B RNAi animals are adult viable. RNAi knockdown of Mlp84B and Î±-actinin together produces synergistic early larval lethality and destabilization of Z-line structures. We recapitulated these phenotypes using combinations of traditional loss-of-function alleles and single-gene RNAi. We observe that Mlp84B induces the formation of actin loops in muscle cell nuclei in the absence of nuclear Î±-actinin, suggesting Mlp84B has intrinsic actin cross-linking activity, which may complement Î±-actinin cross-linking activity at sites of actin filament anchorage. These results reveal a molecular mechanism for MLP stabilization of muscle and implicate reduced actin crosslinking as the primary destabilizing defect in MLP-associated cardiomyopathies. Our data support a model in which Î±-actinin and Mlp84B have important and overlapping functions at sites of actin filament anchorage to preserve muscle structure and function.",2013,"Kathleen A Clark, Julie L Kadrmas, Kathleen A Clark, Julie L Kadrmas"
Selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons by MPP(+) and its rescue by D2 autoreceptors in Drosophila primary culture,23452092,10.1111/jnc.12228,"Drosophila melanogaster is widely used to study genetic factors causing Parkinson's disease (PD) largely because of the use of sophisticated genetic approaches and the presence of a high conservation of gene sequence/function between Drosophila and mammals. However, in Drosophila, little has been done to study the environmental factors which cause over 90% of PD cases. We used Drosophila primary neuronal culture to study degenerative effects of a well-known PD toxin MPP(+) . Dopaminergic (DA) neurons were selectively degenerated by MPP(+) , whereas cholinergic and GABAergic neurons were not affected. This DA neuronal loss was because of post-mitotic degeneration, not by inhibition of DA neuronal differentiation. We also found that MPP(+) -mediated neurodegeneration was rescued by D2 agonists quinpirole and bromocriptine. This rescue was through activation of Drosophila D2 receptor DD2R, as D2 agonists failed to rescue MPP(+) -toxicity in neuronal cultures prepared from both a DD2R deficiency line and a transgenic line pan-neuronally expressing DD2R RNAi. Furthermore, DD2R autoreceptors in DA neurons played a critical role in the rescue. When DD2R RNAi was expressed only in DA neurons, MPP(+) toxicity was not rescued by D2 agonists. Our study also showed that rescue of DA neurodegeneration by Drosophila DD2R activation was mediated through suppression of action potentials in DA neurons.",2013,"Lyle Wiemerslage, Bradley J Schultz, Archan Ganguly, Daewoo Lee, Lyle Wiemerslage, Bradley J Schultz, Archan Ganguly, Daewoo Lee"
Parasitoid wasp venom SERCA regulates Drosophila calcium levels and inhibits cellular immunity,23690612,10.1073/pnas.1222351110,"Because parasite virulence factors target host immune responses, identification and functional characterization of these factors can provide insight into poorly understood host immune mechanisms. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a model system for understanding humoral innate immunity, but Drosophila cellular innate immune responses remain incompletely characterized. Fruit flies are regularly infected by parasitoid wasps in nature and, following infection, flies mount a cellular immune response culminating in the cellular encapsulation of the wasp egg. The mechanistic basis of this response is largely unknown, but wasps use a mixture of virulence proteins derived from the venom gland to suppress cellular encapsulation. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying wasp virulence and fly cellular immunity, we used a joint transcriptomic/proteomic approach to identify venom genes from Ganaspis sp.1 (G1), a previously uncharacterized Drosophila parasitoid species, and found that G1 venom contains a highly abundant sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump. Accordingly, we found that fly immune cells termed plasmatocytes normally undergo a cytoplasmic calcium burst following infection, and that this calcium burst is required for activation of the cellular immune response. We further found that the plasmatocyte calcium burst is suppressed by G1 venom in a SERCA-dependent manner, leading to the failure of plasmatocytes to become activated and migrate toward G1 eggs. Finally, by genetically manipulating plasmatocyte calcium levels, we were able to alter fly immune success against G1 and other parasitoid species. Our characterization of parasitoid wasp venom proteins led us to identify plasmatocyte cytoplasmic calcium bursts as an important aspect of fly cellular immunity.",2013,"Nathan T Mortimer, Jeremy Goecks, Balint Z Kacsoh, James A Mobley, Gregory J Bowersock, James Taylor, Todd A Schlenke, Nathan T Mortimer, Jeremy Goecks, Balint Z Kacsoh, James A Mobley, Gregory J Bowersock, James Taylor, Todd A Schlenke"

In this study, I have demonstrated the effects of multiple genomic regions of Drosophila melanogaster on CGV in wing shape. I examined the effects of 61 genomic deficiencies on quantitative and qualitative natural genetic variation in the wing shape of D. melanogaster. I have identified 10 genomic deficiencies that do not encompass a known candidate evolutionary capacitor, Hsp90, exposing natural CGV differently depending on the location of the deficiencies in the genome. Furthermore, five genomic deficiencies uncovered qualitative CGV in wing morphology. These findings suggest that CGV in wing shape of wild-type D. melanogaster is regulated by multiple capacitors with divergent functions. Future analysis of genes encompassed by these genomic regions would help elucidate novel capacitor genes and better understand the general features of capacitors regarding natural genetic variation.",2013,Kazuo H Takahashi
FlyPrimerBank: an online database for Drosophila melanogaster gene expression analysis and knockdown evaluation of RNAi reagents,23893746,10.1534/g3.113.007021,"The evaluation of specific endogenous transcript levels is important for understanding transcriptional regulation. More specifically, it is useful for independent confirmation of results obtained by the use of microarray analysis or RNA-seq and for evaluating RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene knockdown. Designing specific and effective primers for high-quality, moderate-throughput evaluation of transcript levels, i.e., quantitative, real-time PCR (qPCR), is nontrivial. To meet community needs, predefined qPCR primer pairs for mammalian genes have been designed and sequences made available, e.g., via PrimerBank. In this work, we adapted and refined the algorithms used for the mammalian PrimerBank to design 45,417 primer pairs for 13,860 Drosophila melanogaster genes, with three or more primer pairs per gene. We experimentally validated primer pairs for ~300 randomly selected genes expressed in early Drosophila embryos, using SYBR Green-based qPCR and sequence analysis of products derived from conventional PCR. All relevant information, including primer sequences, isoform specificity, spatial transcript targeting, and any available validation results and/or user feedback, is available from an online database (www.flyrnai.org/flyprimerbank). At FlyPrimerBank, researchers can retrieve primer information for fly genes either one gene at a time or in batch mode. Importantly, we included the overlap of each predicted amplified sequence with RNAi reagents from several public resources, making it possible for researchers to choose primers suitable for knockdown evaluation of RNAi reagents (i.e., to avoid amplification of the RNAi reagent itself).

Berberine Attenuated Aging-Accelerating Effect of High Temperature in Drosophila Model,26167393,10.4236/ajps.2014.53037,"We have observed that berberine prolonged life span and improved viability of pupae and climbing activity of imagoes of wild-type Drosophila melanogaster maintained at 23Â°C. As a continuation of our studies of berberine effect on life span, we were interested to evaluate the effect of berberine of life span in flies maintained at a higher temperature (28Â°C) known to accelerate aging in wild type flies. Considering that genetically or pharmacologically induced deficiency of TRP conversion into KYN prolonged life span in a Drosophila model, we compared the effects of berberine, a powerful inhibitor of kynurenine (KYN) formation from tryptophan (TRP), on life span in wild type and in Drosophila melanogaster mutants (vermilion) with deficient TRP-KYN metabolism maintained at 23Â°C and 28Â°C. High (28Â°C) ambient temperature decreased life span in both wild type and vermilion flies. Aging accelerating effect of high temperature was more pronounced in Oregon than in vermilion flies (-60% vs. -40% decrease of mean life span, resp). Berberine attenuated the aging-accelerating effect of high temperature. Effect of berberine was more pronounced in Oregon (+46%) than in vermilion (+22%) flies. The obtained data suggested the possible involvement of TRP-KYN metabolism in the aging-acceleration effect of the high temperature and in protective effect of berberine.",2014,"Valeriya Navrotskaya, Gregory Oxenkrug, Lyudmila Vorobyova, Paul Summergrad, Valeriya Navrotskaya, Gregory Oxenkrug, Lyudmila Vorobyova, Paul Summergrad"
Neural correlates of water reward in thirsty Drosophila,25262493,10.1038/nn.3827,"Drinking water is innately rewarding to thirsty animals. In addition, the consumed value can be assigned to behavioral actions and predictive sensory cues by associative learning. Here we show that thirst converts water avoidance into water-seeking in naive Drosophila melanogaster. Thirst also permitted flies to learn olfactory cues paired with water reward. Water learning required water taste and <40 water-responsive dopaminergic neurons that innervate a restricted zone of the mushroom body Î³ lobe. These water learning neurons are different from those that are critical for conveying the reinforcing effects of sugar. Naive water-seeking behavior in thirsty flies did not require water taste but relied on another subset of water-responsive dopaminergic neurons that target the mushroom body Î²' lobe. Furthermore, these naive water-approach neurons were not required for learned water-seeking. Our results therefore demonstrate that naive water-seeking, learned water-seeking and water learning use separable neural circuitry in the brain of thirsty flies.",2014,"Suewei Lin, David Owald, Vikram Chandra, Clifford Talbot, Wolf Huetteroth, Scott Waddell, Suewei Lin, David Owald, Vikram Chandra, Clifford Talbot, Wolf Huetteroth, Scott Waddell"
Naturally occurring deletions of hunchback binding sites in the even-skipped stripe 3+7 enhancer,24786295,10.1371/journal.pone.0091924,"Changes in regulatory DNA contribute to phenotypic differences within and between taxa. Comparative studies show that many transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) are conserved between species whereas functional studies reveal that some mutations segregating within species alter TFBS function. Consistently, in this analysis of 13 regulatory elements in Drosophila melanogaster populations, single base and insertion/deletion polymorphism are rare in characterized regulatory elements. Experimentally defined TFBS are nearly devoid of segregating mutations and, as has been shown before, are quite conserved. For instance 8 of 11 Hunchback binding sites in the stripe 3+7 enhancer of even-skipped are conserved between D. melanogaster and Drosophila virilis. Oddly, we found a 72 bp deletion that removes one of these binding sites (Hb8), segregating within D. melanogaster. Furthermore, a 45 bp deletion polymorphism in the spacer between the stripe 3+7 and stripe 2 enhancers, removes another predicted Hunchback site. These two deletions are separated by ??50 bp, sit on distinct haplotypes, and segregate at appreciable frequency. The Hb8? is at 5 to 35% frequency in the new world, but also shows cosmopolitan distribution. There is depletion of sequence variation on the Hb8?-carrying haplotype. Quantitative genetic tests indicate that Hb8? affects developmental time, but not viability of offspring. The Eve expression pattern differs between inbred lines, but the stripe 3 and 7 boundaries seem unaffected by Hb8?.

Complex and non-redundant signals from individual odor receptors that underlie chemotaxis behavior in Drosophila melanogaster larvae,25238759,10.1242/bio.20148573,"The rules by which odor receptors encode odors and allow behavior are still largely unexplored. Although large data sets of electrophysiological responses of receptors to odors have been generated, few hypotheses have been tested with behavioral assays. We use a data set on odor responses of Drosophila larval odor receptors coupled with chemotaxis behavioral assays to examine rules of odor coding. Using mutants of odor receptors, we have found that odor receptors with similar electrophysiological responses to odors across concentrations play non-redundant roles in odor coding at specific odor concentrations. We have also found that high affinity receptors for odors determine behavioral response thresholds, but the rules for determining peak behavioral responses are more complex. While receptor mutants typically show loss of attraction to odors, some receptor mutants result in increased attraction at specific odor concentrations. The odor receptor mutants were rescued using transgenic expression of odor receptors, validating assignment of phenotypes to the alleles. Vapor pressures alone cannot fully explain behavior in our assay. Finally, some odors that did not elicit strong electrophysiological responses are associated with behavioral phenotypes upon examination of odor receptor mutants. This result is consistent with the role of sensory neurons in lateral inhibition via local interneurons in the antennal lobe. Taken together, our results suggest a complexity of odor coding rules even in a simple olfactory sensory system.",2014,"Jeewanjot S Grewal, Christine Nguyen, Raquel Robles, Christina Cho, Karolina Kir, Nicole Fledderman, George Gacharna, Michael Wesolowski, Christie Klinger, Pedro Vallejo, Lorien Menhennett, Abhiram Nagaraj, Chineze Ebo, Garrett Peacy, Eftihia Davelis, David Kucher, Sarah Giers, Scott A Kreher, Jeewanjot S Grewal, Christine Nguyen, Raquel Robles, Christina Cho, Karolina Kir, Nicole Fledderman, George Gacharna, Michael Wesolowski, Christie Klinger, Pedro Vallejo, Lorien Menhennett, Abhiram Nagaraj, Chineze Ebo, Garrett Peacy, Eftihia Davelis, David Kucher, Sarah Giers, Scott A Kreher"

The methylation we observe with this method is highly localized and strand asymmetrical, limited to regions covering ??% of the genome, dynamic in early embryogenesis, and concentrated in specific 5-base sequence motifs that are CA- and CT-rich but depleted of guanine. Gene body methylation is associated with lower expression, and many genes containing methylated regions have developmental or transcriptional functions. The only known DNA methyltransferase in Drosophila is the DNMT2 homolog MT2, but lines deficient for MT2 retain genomic methylation, implying the presence of a novel methyltransferase.

Analysis of Drosophila lipids by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometric imaging,25329240,10.1021/ac503171f,"Drosophila melanogaster is a major model organism for numerous lipid-related diseases. While comprehensive lipidomic profiles have been generated for D. melanogaster, little information is available on the localization of individual lipid classes and species. Here, we show the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometric imaging (MALDI-MSI) to profile lipids in D. melanogaster tissue sections. The preparation of intact cryosections from whole insects presents a challenge due to the brittle hydrophobic cuticle surrounding the body and heterogeneous tissue types beneath the cuticle. However, the introduction of a novel sucrose infiltration step and gelatin as an embedding media greatly improved the quality of tissue sections. We generated MS image profiles of six major lipid classes: phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and triacylglycerides. In addition, signals corresponding to two male-specific sex pheromones were detected in the ejaculatory bulb, a specialized site of pheromone production. MSI performed with 35 Î¼m lateral resolution provided high sensitivity detection of at least 92 different lipid species, based on exact mass. In contrast, MSI with 10 Î¼m lateral resolution enabled the detection of 36 lipid species but allowed lipid profiling of individual organs. The ability to localize lipid classes in intact sections from whole Drosophila provides a powerful tool for characterizing the effects of diet, age, stress, and environment on lipid production and distribution.",2014,"Ann-Christin Niehoff, Hans Kettling, Alexander Pirkl, Yin Ning Chiang, Klaus Dreisewerd, Joanne Y Yew, Ann-Christin Niehoff, Hans Kettling, Alexander Pirkl, Yin Ning Chiang, Klaus Dreisewerd, Joanne Y Yew"

To determine the toxicity and cell viability of this compound in-vivo we present, herein, a study using Drosophila melanogaster. In the absence of light, the new photosensitizer shows no discernible effects to fly larvae at various concentrations of compound and stages of larval development.

The effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity in Drosophila melanogaster,24790098,10.1242/jeb.095646,"The effects of flight behavior on physiology and senescence may be profound in insects because of the extremely high metabolic costs of flight. Flight capacity in insects decreases with age; in contrast, limiting flight behavior extends lifespan and slows the age-related loss of antioxidant capacity and accumulation of oxidative damage in flight muscles. In this study, we tested the effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity by measuring wingbeat frequency, the ability to fly in a hypo-dense gas mixture, and metabolic rate in Drosophila melanogaster. Specifically, 5-day-old adult flies were separated into three life-long treatments: (1) those not allowed to fly (no flight), (2) those allowed - but not forced - to fly (voluntary flight) and (3) those mechanically stimulated to fly (induced flight). Flight capacity senesced earliest in flies from the no-flight treatment, followed by the induced-flight group and then the voluntary flight group. Wingbeat frequency senesced with age in all treatment groups, but was most apparent in the voluntary- and induced-flight groups. Metabolic rate during agitated flight senesced earliest and most rapidly in the induced flight group, and was low and uniform throughout age in the no-flight group. Early senescence in the induced-flight group was likely due to the acceleration of deleterious aging phenomena such as the rapid accumulation of damage at the cellular level, while the early loss of flight capacity and low metabolic rates in the no-flight group demonstrate that disuse effects can also significantly alter senescence patterns of whole-insect performance.",2014,"Steven J Lane, W Anthony Frankino, Michelle M Elekonich, Stephen P Roberts, Steven J Lane, W Anthony Frankino, Michelle M Elekonich, Stephen P Roberts"
A computational model of nuclear self-organisation in syncytial embryos,24929041,10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.06.001,"Syncytial embryos develop through cycles of nuclear division and rearrangement within a common cytoplasm. A paradigm example is Drosophila melanogaster in which nuclei form an ordered array in the embryo surface over cell cycles 10-13. This ordering process is assumed to be essential for subsequent cellularisation. Using quantitative tissue analysis, it has previously been shown that the regrowth of actin and microtubule networks after nuclear division generates reordering forces that counteract its disordering effect (Kanesaki et al., 2011). We present here an individual-based computer simulation modelling the nuclear dynamics. In contrast to similar modelling approaches e.g. epithelial monolayers or tumour spheroids, we focus not on the spatial dependence, but rather on the time-dependence of the interaction laws. We show that appropriate phenomenological inter-nuclear force laws reproduce the experimentally observed dynamics provided that the cytoskeletal network regrows sufficiently quickly after mitosis. Then repulsive forces provided by the actin system are necessary and sufficient to regain the observed level of order in the system, after the strong disruption resulting from cytoskeletal network disassembly and spindle formation. We also observe little mixing of nuclei through cell cycles. Our study highlights the importance of the dynamics of cytoskeletal forces during this critical phase of syncytial development and emphasises the need for real-time experimental data at high temporal resolution.",2014,"Christoph Koke, Takuma Kanesaki, JÃ¶rg Grosshans, Ulrich S Schwarz, Carina M Dunlop, Christoph Koke, Takuma Kanesaki, JÃ¶rg Grosshans, Ulrich S Schwarz, Carina M Dunlop"
Â¹Â³C NMR metabolomics: applications at natural abundance,25140385,10.1021/ac502346h,"(13)C NMR has many advantages for a metabolomics study, including a large spectral dispersion, narrow singlets at natural abundance, and a direct measure of the backbone structures of metabolites. However, it has not had widespread use because of its relatively low sensitivity compounded by low natural abundance. Here we demonstrate the utility of high-quality (13)C NMR spectra obtained using a custom (13)C-optimized probe on metabolomic mixtures. A workflow was developed to use statistical correlations between replicate 1D (13)C and (1)H spectra, leading to composite spin systems that can be used to search publicly available databases for compound identification. This was developed using synthetic mixtures and then applied to two biological samples, Drosophila melanogaster extracts and mouse serum. Using the synthetic mixtures we were able to obtain useful (13)C-(13)C statistical correlations from metabolites with as little as 60 nmol of material. The lower limit of (13)C NMR detection under our experimental conditions is approximately 40 nmol, slightly lower than the requirement for statistical analysis. The (13)C and (1)H data together led to 15 matches in the database compared to just 7 using (1)H alone, and the (13)C correlated peak lists had far fewer false positives than the (1)H generated lists.

In vivo immunostaining of hemocyte compartments in Drosophila for live imaging,24892745,10.1371/journal.pone.0098191,"In recent years, Drosophila melanogaster has become an attractive model organism in which to study the structure and development of the cellular immune components. The emergence of immunological markers greatly accelerated the identification of the immune cells (hemocytes), while the creation of genetic reporter constructs allowed unique insight into the structural organization of hematopoietic tissues. However, investigation of the hemocyte compartments by the means of immunological markers requires dissection and fixation, which regularly disrupt the delicate structure and hamper the microanatomical characterization. Moreover, the investigation of transgenic reporters alone can be misleading as their expression often differs from the native expression pattern of their respective genes. We describe here a method that combines the reporter constructs and the immunological tools in live imaging, thereby allowing use of the array of available immunological markers while retaining the structural integrity of the hematopoietic compartments. The procedure allows the reversible immobilization of Drosophila larvae for high-resolution confocal imaging and the time-lapse video analysis of in vivo reporters. When combined with our antibody injection-based in situ immunostaining assay, the resulting double labeling of the hemocyte compartments can provide new information on the microanatomy and functional properties of the hematopoietic tissues in an intact state.

We now demonstrate synergistic interactions of spineless and CG5017 in pathways controlling oxidative stress response and long-term memory formation in Drosophila melanogaster. Oxidative stress was induced by low doses of X-ray irradiation of flies carrying hypomorphic mutation of spineless, mutation of CG5017, and their combination. To determine the sensitivity of these mutants to pharmacological modifiers of the irradiation effect, we irradiated flies growing on standard medium supplemented by radiosensitizer furazidin and radioprotector serotonin. The effects of irradiation were investigated by analyzing leg and antenna morphological structures and by using real-time PCR to measure mRNA expression levels for spineless, Cyp6g1 and Gst-theta genes. We also examined long-term memory in these mutants using conditioned courtship suppression paradigm. Our results show that the interaction of spineless and CG5017 is important for regulation of morphogenesis, long-term memory formation, and detoxification during oxidative stress.

We have conditioned D. melanogaster with oleic (C18:1) and stearic (C18:0) acids, two common dietary fatty acids, respectively preferred by larvae and adult. Wild-type individuals exposed either during a transient period of development-from embryo to adult-or more permanently-during one to ten generation cycles-were affected by such conditioning. In particular, the oviposition preference of females exposed to each fatty acid during larval development was affected without cross-effect indicating the specificity of each substance. Permanent exposure to each fatty acid also drastically changed oviposition preference as well as major fitness traits (development duration, sex-ratio, fecundity, adult lethality). This suggests that D. melanogaster ability to adapt to new food sources is determined by its genetic and sensory plasticity both of which may explain the success of this generalist-diet species.",2014,"Justin Flaven-Pouchon, Thibault Garcia, Dehbia Abed-Vieillard, Jean-Pierre Farine, Jean-FranÃ§ois Ferveur, Claude Everaerts"

The overexpressed levels of wild-type JNK and Akt, (UAS-bsk and UAS-Akt) with TH-GAL4 and elav-GAL4 drivers improved the survival duration of exposed flies compared with controls. Thus, we found that Akt and JNK both protect against loss of dopamine activity associated with 1-octen-3-ol exposure, indicating the pro-survival role of these signaling pathways.

Here, we focus on the effect of dietary protein content (low, intermediate, and high) on mortality trajectories in late life in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. According to the two theories that are mainly implicated in explaining the deceleration of mortality rate in late life (the heterogeneity/frailty theory and the Hamiltonian theory), we predict, in general, the occurrence of late-life mortality deceleration under most circumstances, independent of sex and dietary regime. However, the heterogeneity theory of late life is more flexible in allowing no mortality deceleration to occur under certain circumstances compared with the Hamiltonian theory. We applied a novel statistical approach based on Bayesian inference of age-specific mortality rates and found a deceleration of late-life mortality rates on all diets in males but only on the intermediate (standard) diet in females. The difference in mortality rate deceleration between males and females on extreme diets suggests that the existence of mortality plateaus in late life is sex and diet dependent and, therefore, not a universal characteristic of large enough cohorts.",2014,"Felix Zajitschek, Tuo Jin, Fernando Colchero, Alexei A Maklakov, Felix Zajitschek, Tuo Jin, Fernando Colchero, Alexei A Maklakov"

Females learned and subsequently preferred to lay eggs at patches with novel flavours previously associated with feeding larvae over patches with novel flavours previously associated with no larvae. However, when we controlled for the duration of exposure to each flavoured patch, females no longer preferred the flavour previously associated with feeding larvae.

The commonly used saline drifts in pH and will cause an alteration in the heart rate. We identify a saline that maintains a stable pH and physiological function in the larval heart, skeletal neuromuscular junction, and ventral nerve cord preparations. Using these common assays, we screened various pH buffers of differing concentrations to identify optimum conditions. Buffers at 25 mM produce a stable heart rate with minimal variation in pH. Excitatory junction potentials evoked directly on larval muscles or through sensory-CNS-motor circuits were unaffected by at buffers at 25 mM.

Using a common normal X chromosome, one of two different full-length Y chromosomes, and a third chromosome from a series of otherwise-isogenic rDNA deletions, I detected no differences in X-Y or Y-Y pairing or chromosome segregation frequencies that could not be attributed to random variation alone. This work was performed in the context of an undergraduate teaching program at Texas A&M University, and I discuss the pedagogical utility of this and other such experiments.",2014,"Keith A Maggert, Keith A Maggert"
Regulation of centromere localization of the Drosophila Shugoshin MEI-S332 and sister-chromatid cohesion in meiosis,25081981,10.1534/g3.114.012823,"The Shugoshin (Sgo) protein family helps to ensure proper chromosome segregation by protecting cohesion at the centromere by preventing cleavage of the cohesin complex. Some Sgo proteins also influence other aspects of kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Although many Sgo members require Aurora B kinase to localize to the centromere, factors controlling delocalization are poorly understood and diverse. Moreover, it is not clear how Sgo function is inactivated and whether this is distinct from delocalization. We investigated these questions in Drosophila melanogaster, an organism with superb chromosome cytology to monitor Sgo localization and quantitative assays to test its function in sister-chromatid segregation in meiosis. Previous research showed that in mitosis in cell culture, phosphorylation of the Drosophila Sgo, MEI-S332, by Aurora B promotes centromere localization, whereas Polo phosphorylation promotes delocalization. These studies also suggested that MEI-S332 can be inactivated independently of delocalization, a conclusion supported here by localization and function studies in meiosis. Phosphoresistant and phosphomimetic mutants for the Aurora B and Polo phosphorylation sites were examined for effects on MEI-S332 localization and chromosome segregation in meiosis. Strikingly, MEI-S332 with a phosphomimetic mutation in the Aurora B phosphorylation site prematurely dissociates from the centromeres in meiosis I. Despite the absence of MEI-S332 on meiosis II centromeres in male meiosis, sister chromatids segregate normally, demonstrating that detectable levels of this Sgo are not essential for chromosome congression, kinetochore biorientation, or spindle assembly.",2014,"Cristina Nogueira, Helena Kashevsky, Belinda Pinto, Astrid Clarke, Terry L Orr-Weaver, Cristina Nogueira, Helena Kashevsky, Belinda Pinto, Astrid Clarke, Terry L Orr-Weaver"
Circadian clocks of faster developing fruit fly populations also age faster,24085519,10.1007/s10522-013-9467-y,"Age-related changes in circadian rhythms have been studied in several model organisms including fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster. Although a general trend of period (?) lengthening, reduction in rhythm strength and eventual arrhythmicity with increasing age has been reported, age-related changes in circadian rhythms have seldom been examined in the light of differences in the rate of ageing of the organism. We used four populations of fruit flies D. melanogaster which were selected to develop faster (as pre-adults) to ask if circadian clocks of these flies age faster than their controls. After 55 generations, the selected populations (FD) started developing ~29-h (~12 %) faster than the controls (BD) while their circadian clocks exhibited ? ~0.5-h shorter than the controls. We assayed the activity/rest behaviour and adult lifespan of virgin males from the FD and BD populations under constant dark (DD) conditions. The results revealed that FD flies live significantly shorter, and markers of ageing of circadian rhythms set-in earlier in the FD flies compared to the BD controls, which suggests that circadian clocks of faster developing flies age faster than controls. These results can be taken to suggest that ageing of circadian clocks in fruit flies D. melanogaster is a function of its physiological rather than chronological age.",2014,"Pankaj Yadav, Vijay Kumar Sharma, Pankaj Yadav, Vijay Kumar Sharma"

TRAF6 is a novel regulator of Notch signaling in Drosophila melanogaster,25280943,10.1016/j.cellsig.2014.09.016,"Notch signaling pathway unravels a fundamental cellular communication system that plays an elemental role in development. It is evident from different studies that the outcome of Notch signaling depends on signal strength, timing, cell type, and cellular context. Since Notch signaling affects a spectrum of cellular activity at various developmental stages by reorganizing itself in more than one way to produce different intensities in the signaling output, it is important to understand the context dependent complexity of Notch signaling and different routes of its regulation. We identified, TRAF6 (Drosophila homolog of mammalian TRAF6) as an interacting partner of Notch intracellular domain (Notch-ICD). TRAF6 genetically interacts with Notch pathway components in trans-heterozygous combinations. Immunocytochemical analysis shows that TRAF6 co-localizes with Notch in Drosophila third instar larval tissues. Our genetic interaction data suggests that the loss-of-function of TRAF6 leads to the rescue of previously identified Kurtz-Deltex mediated wing notching phenotype and enhances Notch protein survival. Co-expression of TRAF6 and Deltex results in depletion of Notch in the larval wing discs and down-regulates Notch targets, Wingless and Cut. Taken together, our results suggest that TRAF6 may function as a negative regulator of Notch signaling.",2014,"Abhinava K Mishra, Nalani Sachan, Mousumi Mutsuddi, Ashim Mukherjee, Abhinava K Mishra, Nalani Sachan, Mousumi Mutsuddi, Ashim Mukherjee"
Modeling glial contributions to seizures and epileptogenesis: cation-chloride cotransporters in Drosophila melanogaster,24971529,10.1371/journal.pone.0101117,"Flies carrying a kcc loss-of-function mutation are more seizure-susceptible than wild-type flies. The kcc gene is the highly conserved Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of K+/Cl- cotransporter genes thought to be expressed in all animal cell types. Here, we examined the spatial and temporal requirements for kcc loss-of-function to modify seizure-susceptibility in flies. Targeted RNA interference (RNAi) of kcc in various sets of neurons was sufficient to induce severe seizure-sensitivity. Interestingly, kcc RNAi in glia was particularly effective in causing seizure-sensitivity. Knockdown of kcc in glia or neurons during development caused a reduction in seizure induction threshold, cell swelling, and brain volume increase in 24-48 hour old adult flies. Third instar larval peripheral nerves were enlarged when kcc RNAi was expressed in neurons or glia. Results suggest that a threshold of K+/Cl- cotransport dysfunction in the nervous system during development is an important determinant of seizure-susceptibility in Drosophila. The findings presented are the first attributing a causative role for glial cation-chloride cotransporters in seizures and epileptogenesis. The importance of elucidating glial cell contributions to seizure disorders and the utility of Drosophila models is discussed.",2014,"Zeid M Rusan, Olivia A Kingsford, Mark A Tanouye, Zeid M Rusan, Olivia A Kingsford, Mark A Tanouye"
Role of Bacopa monnieri in the temporal regulation of oxidative stress in clock mutant (cryb) of Drosophila melanogaster,24780191,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2014.04.005,"Accruing evidences imply that circadian organization of biochemical, endocrinological, cellular and physiological processes contribute to wellness of organisms and in the development of pathologies such as malignancy, sleep and endocrine disorders. Oxidative stress is known to mediate a number of diseases and it is notable to comprehend the orchestration of circadian clock of a model organism of circadian biology, Drosophila melanogaster, under oxidative stress. We investigated the nexus between circadian clock and oxidative stress susceptibility by exposing D. melanogaster to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or rotenone; the reversibility of rhythms following exposure to Bacopa monnieri extract (ayurvedic medicine rich in antioxidants) was also investigated. Abolishment of 24h rhythms in physiological response (negative geotaxis), oxidative stress markers (protein carbonyl and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) and antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase and reduced glutathione) were observed under oxidative stress. Furthermore, abolishment of per mRNA rhythm in H2O2 treated wild type flies and augmented susceptibility to oxidative stress in clock mutant (cry(b)) flies connotes the role of circadian clock in reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. Significant reversibility of rhythms was noted following B. monnieri treatment in wild type flies than cry(b) flies.

Distinct chromatin features characterize different classes of repeat sequences in Drosophila melanogaster,24498936,10.1186/1471-2164-15-105,"Background:
      
    

    
      Repeat sequences are abundant in eukaryotic genomes but many are excluded from genome assemblies. In Drosophila melanogaster classical studies of repeat content suggested variability between individuals, but they lacked the precision of modern high throughput sequencing technologies. Genome-wide profiling of chromatin features such as histone tail modifications and DNA-binding proteins relies on alignment to the reference genome and hence excludes highly repetitive sequences.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      By analyzing repeat libraries, sequence complexity and k-mer counts we determined the abundances of different D. melanogaster repeat classes in flies in two public datasets, DGRP and modENCODE. We found that larval DNA was depleted of all repeat classes relative to adult and embryonic DNA, as expected from the known depletion of repeat-rich pericentromeric regions during polytenization of larval tissues. By applying a method that is independent of alignment to the genome assembly, we found that satellite repeats associate with distinct H3 tail modifications, such as H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 for short repeats and H3K9me1 for 359 bp repeats. Short AT-rich repeats however are depleted of nucleosomes and hence all histone modifications and associated chromatin proteins.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The total repeat content and association of repeat sequences with chromatin modifications can be determined despite repeats being excluded from genome assemblies, revealing unexpected distinctions in chromatin features based on sequence composition.",2014,"Kristina Krassovsky, Steven Henikoff, Kristina Krassovsky, Steven Henikoff"

Furthermore, we will discuss the behavioral paradigms that are regulated by DA signaling in flies.

Fly brains were analyzed frozen to prevent molecular redistribution prior to analysis. Different molecules were found to distribute differently in the tissue, particularly the eye pigments, diacylglycerides, and phospholipids, and this is expected to be driven by their biological functions in the brain. Correlations in the localization of these molecules were also observed using principal components analysis of image data, and this was used to identify peaks for further analysis. Furthermore, consecutive analyses following 10 keV Ar2500+ sputtering showed that different biomolecules respond differently to Ar2500+ sputtering.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting analyses confirmed that BmOXR1 mRNA and its 140-kDa protein were differentially expressed in diapause eggs compared to non-diapause eggs. OXR1 double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was injected into diapause-destined eggs before the cellular blastoderm stage, and 4days later, when untreated eggs reached the diapause stage, the OXR1 protein disappeared; however, these eggs remained in diapause, suggesting that BmOXR1 is not essential for diapause initiation and/or maintenance. To further investigate the in vivo function of BmOXR1 apart from its role in diapause, we overexpressed BmOXR1 in Drosophila melanogaster. The fruit fly male adult life-span was significantly extended in the 50%-survival time when adults were reared on diets both with and without H2O2 solution under 25Â°C incubation. These results suggest that BmOXR1 functions in D. melanogaster via a possible antioxidant effect. As BmOXR1 was expressed mainly in the nuclei of D. melanogaster cells, the mechanism underlying its antioxidation effect appears to be different from that in humans where it is expressed mainly in the mitochondria.

In the current study, a newly created intron (Intron L) was identified on exon 2 of vulcan in D. melanogaster by comparing expression sequence tags. The RT-PCR experiment revealed that Intron L was associated with intron retention, in which two alternative transcripts of the gene differ by the inclusion or removal of an intron. It was found that Intron L was created by intronization of exonic sequence, and its donor and acceptor splice sites were created by synonymous mutation, leading to the origin of a new vulcan protein that is 22 amino acids shorter than the previously reported vulcan protein. Moreover, to track the origin of Intron L, 36 orthologous genes of species of Drosophila were cloned or annotated, and phylogenetic analysis was carried out. It indicated that the common ancestor of D. melangaster subgroup species created Intron L about 15 million years ago.",2014,"Leilei Zhan, Qiaohong Meng, Ran Chen, Yuan Yue, Yongfeng Jin"
Novel Drosophila viruses encode host-specific suppressors of RNAi,25032815,10.1371/journal.ppat.1004256,"The ongoing conflict between viruses and their hosts can drive the co-evolution between host immune genes and viral suppressors of immunity. It has been suggested that an evolutionary 'arms race' may occur between rapidly evolving components of the antiviral RNAi pathway of Drosophila and viral genes that antagonize it. We have recently shown that viral protein 1 (VP1) of Drosophila melanogaster Nora virus (DmelNV) suppresses Argonaute-2 (AGO2)-mediated target RNA cleavage (slicer activity) to antagonize antiviral RNAi. Here we show that viral AGO2 antagonists of divergent Nora-like viruses can have host specific activities. We have identified novel Nora-like viruses in wild-caught populations of D. immigrans (DimmNV) and D. subobscura (DsubNV) that are 36% and 26% divergent from DmelNV at the amino acid level. We show that DimmNV and DsubNV VP1 are unable to suppress RNAi in D. melanogaster S2 cells, whereas DmelNV VP1 potently suppresses RNAi in this host species. Moreover, we show that the RNAi suppressor activity of DimmNV VP1 is restricted to its natural host species, D. immigrans. Specifically, we find that DimmNV VP1 interacts with D. immigrans AGO2, but not with D. melanogaster AGO2, and that it suppresses slicer activity in embryo lysates from D. immigrans, but not in lysates from D. melanogaster. This species-specific interaction is reflected in the ability of DimmNV VP1 to enhance RNA production by a recombinant Sindbis virus in a host-specific manner. Our results emphasize the importance of analyzing viral RNAi suppressor activity in the relevant host species. We suggest that rapid co-evolution between RNA viruses and their hosts may result in host species-specific activities of RNAi suppressor proteins, and therefore that viral RNAi suppressors could be host-specificity factors.",2014,"JoÃ«l T van Mierlo, Gijs J Overheul, Benjamin Obadia, Koen W R van Cleef, Claire L Webster, Maria-Carla Saleh, Darren J Obbard, Ronald P van Rij, JoÃ«l T van Mierlo, Gijs J Overheul, Benjamin Obadia, Koen W R van Cleef, Claire L Webster, Maria-Carla Saleh, Darren J Obbard, Ronald P van Rij"
Experimental evolution reveals habitat-specific fitness dynamics among Wolbachia clades in Drosophila melanogaster,24387805,10.1111/mec.12643,"The diversity and infection dynamics of the endosymbiont Wolbachia can be influenced by many factors, such as transmission rate, cytoplasmic incompatibility, environment, selection and genetic drift. The interplay of these factors in natural populations can result in heterogeneous infection patterns with substantial differences between populations and strains. The causes of these heterogeneities are not yet understood, partly due to the complexity of natural environments. We present experimental evolution as a new approach to study Wolbachia infection dynamics in replicate populations exposed to a controlled environment. A natural Drosophila melanogaster population infected with strains of Wolbachia belonging to different clades evolved in two laboratory environments (hot and cold) for 1.5 years. In both treatments, the rate of Wolbachia infection increased until fixation. In the hot environment, the relative frequency of different Wolbachia clades remained stable over 37 generations. In the cold environment, however, we observed marked changes in the composition of the Wolbachia population: within 15 generations, one Wolbachia clade increased more than 50% in frequency, whereas the other two clades decreased in frequency, resulting in the loss of one clade. The frequency change was highly reproducible not only among replicates, but also when flies that evolved for 42 generations in the hot environment were transferred to the cold environment. These results document how environmental factors can affect the composition of Wolbachia in D. melanogaster. The high reproducibility of the pattern suggests that experimental evolution studies can efficiently determine the functional basis of habitat-specific fitness among Wolbachia strains.",2014,"Elisabetta Versace, Viola Nolte, Ram Vinay Pandey, Ray Tobler, Christian SchlÃ¶tterer, Elisabetta Versace, Viola Nolte, Ram Vinay Pandey, Ray Tobler, Christian SchlÃ¶tterer"
Straightforward assay for quantification of social avoidance in Drosophila melanogaster,25549275,10.3791/52011,"Drosophila melanogaster is an emerging model to study different aspects of social interactions. For example, flies avoid areas previously occupied by stressed conspecifics due to an odorant released during stress known as the Drosophila stress odorant (dSO). Through the use of the T-maze apparatus, one can quantify the avoidance of the dSO by responder flies in a very affordable and robust assay. Conditions necessary to obtain a strong performance are presented here. A stressful experience is necessary for the flies to emit dSO, as well as enough emitter flies to cause a robust avoidance response to the presence of dSO. Genetic background, but not their group size, strongly altered the avoidance of the dSO by the responder flies. Canton-S and Elwood display a higher performance in avoiding the dSO than Oregon and Samarkand strains. This behavioral assay will allow identification of mechanisms underlying this social behavior, and the assessment of the influence of genes and environmental conditions on both emission and avoidance of the dSO.

DNA ligase from Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Purification and physical characterization,3090038,,"A DNA ligase has been purified approximately 2,100-fold, to near-homogeneity, from Drosophila melanogaster 6-12-h embryos and was shown to catalyze the formation of 3',5'-phosphodiester bonds.

These polypeptides were shown by partial proteolysis studies and two-dimensional gel analysis to be structurally related. The two smaller polypeptides were presumably derived from the largest, 83,000 molecular weight protein, by proteolysis during purification or in vivo. All three polypeptides formed enzyme-adenylylate complexes in the absence of DNA. Drosophila DNA ligase had a Stokes radius of 45 A, a sedimentation coefficient of 4.3 S, and a frictional ratio of 1.6, yielding a calculated molecular weight of 79,800. These studies indicate that DNA ligase from Drosophila embryos is a monomer. The purified ligase was free of detectable ATPase, nuclease, topoisomerase, and DNA polymerase activities. The enzyme exhibited an absolute requirement for ATP in the joining reaction. A divalent metal was required and N-ethylmaleimide inhibited the reaction. Formation of phosphodiester bonds by Drosophila ligase required the presence of 5'-phosphoryl and 3'-hydroxyl termini.

Three main points emerge: fine bands are well preserved allowing detection of some not recorded in maps made on classical acid-fixed preparations. Structures with the morphology of putative nascent ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles are apparent in puffs, diffuse bands and virtually all interbands observed. At this level the morphology of native chromosomes is consistent with the hypothesis that all decondensed regions are members of a continuum of transcriptionally active structures.

Relationship between alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity and metabolic rate during flight in Drosophila melanogaster,3089214,10.1007/BF00502792,"Measurements of wing-beat frequency (WBF) have been used to characterize flight muscle metabolic rate in Drosophila melanogaster during tethered flight.

It was found that flies with an approximate 50% reduction in alpha GPDH activity have a metabolic rate that is, in most cases, indistinguishable from that of wild-type flies and, in the most extreme cases, reduced by only 4%. These results demonstrate that alpha Gpdh is not a ""major gene"" for flight metabolism, in the quantitative genetic sense of the term. These results are in agreement with the Kacser and Burns (1973, 1979, 1981) theory of flux, which postulates that the activity of an enzyme embedded in a multienzyme pathway can sometimes vary from wild-type to very low levels (perhaps 5-10% wild type) with no significant effect on flux through the total pathway.",1986,"E M Connors, J W Curtsinger, E M Connors, J W Curtsinger"

In embryos, the transcripts are uniformly distributed. In larvae, ras transcripts are restricted to dividing cells (e.g., imaginal disks, gonads, and brain). At the adult stage, several tissues contain ras transcripts. The strongest hybridization signals are localized to the adult ovaries and to the cortex of the brain and ganglia, which at this stage are comprised of differentiated, nondividing cells. The tissue distribution of ras transcripts in D. melanogaster suggests that the ras proteins have multiple roles during development which may be related to both the proliferative and differentiated states of the tissues.",1986,"D Segal, B Z Shilo"

This gene contains a single intron in the 5'-noncoding region. The 5'-flanking sequence was compared to the 5'-conserved regions of yolk polypeptide-encoding genes (yp) of Drosophila melanogaster. Two regions were found in the 5'-flanking sequence of the mvg gene that have 66% similarity to the D. melanogaster yp consensus sequence that is believed to be involved in gene expression controlled by ecdysteroids. Furthermore, the sequences flanking these two regions are also similar to the ecdysone-responsive elements found in several genes of D. melanogaster. In fact, preliminary experiments showed that mVg mRNA synthesis is induced by the 20-hydroxyecdysone. Four regions of the mvg gene resemble the upstream conserved regions of the two vitellogenin-encoding genes of the locust, Locusta migratoria.

Ultrastructure of the ocellar visual system in normal and mutant Drosophila melanogaster,2500507,10.3109/01677068909066203,"Between the two compound eyes on the vertex on the adult head are the three simple eyes, ocelli. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy were used to investigate the corneal lenses, ocellar photoreceptors, and axonal projections in normal and mutant Drosophila melanogaster. In wild type flies, the cornea consists of about 45 lamellae. It has corneal nipples distally and is underlaid with a monolayer of corneagenous cells. Retinula cells have open rhabdomeres of about 2 microns (diameter) x 7 microns (length). Rhabdomeres extend to the distal extent of the cell and do not have caps. Microvilli have a rodlet within. Retinula cells are joined by belt desmosomes on the lateral borders. Eye color pigment granules are housed within the retinula cells of normal flies, not in accessory cells. The granules do not migrate in response to light. No screening pigment granules exist in the white mutant. Each ocellus has about 80 retinula cells whose axons project to corresponding ganglia from which 4 giant afferent interneurons (per ganglion) project to the brain. receptor terminals are invested with capitate projections from glia. Receptors synapse onto dyads of follower cells, usually interneuron processes, at sites of T shaped presynaptic ribbons. These ""T bars"" are surrounded by indistinct flattened vesicles. Interneurons make feed back synapses onto receptor terminals at T bars clustered with distinct round vesicles. Three mutants with abnormal ocelli were investigated. The none mutant has unusual compound eye and ocellar corneas. The compound eye is devoid of differentiated photoreceptors but some axons from undifferentiated cells from synapses. No receptors were found in the ocelli of none. The oc mutant has no ocelli, although sometimes an ocellar cornea like that of none is seen; the compound eye is normal. The rdo mutant is also specific to ocelli with smaller ocelli having half the wild type allotment of receptor cells; the number of giant afferents is unaffected. Mutants best known for their compound eye defects were examined. The norpA mutant loses its ocellar rhabdomeres with age but has normal feed forward and feed back synapses. This normal synaptology prevails despite the electrophysiological defects in norpA ocelli reported earlier. The rdgABS12 mutant has poorly formed ocellar receptors which show some degeneration with age but synapses survive. The trp. rdgBKS222 and rgdAPC47 mutants are essentially normal with respect to structure and survival of ocellar receptors and synapses.",1989,"W S Stark, R Sapp, S D Carlson, W S Stark, R Sapp, S D Carlson"
Modified P elements that mimic the P cytotype in Drosophila melanogaster,2558959,,"Activity of the P family of transposable elements in Drosophila melanogaster is regulated primarily by a cellular condition known as P cytotype. It has been hypothesized that P cytotype depends on a P element-encoded repressor of transposition and excision. We provide evidence in support of this idea by showing that two modified P elements, each with lesions affecting the fourth transposase exon, mimic most of the P cytotype effects. These elements were identified by means of two sensitive assays capable of detecting repression by a single P element. One assay makes use of cytotype-dependent gene expression of certain P element insertion mutations at the singed bristle locus. The other measures suppression of transposase activity from the unusually stable genomic P element, delta 2-3(99B), that normally produces transposase in both germinal and somatic tissues. The P cytotype-like effects include suppression of snw germline hypermutability, snw somatic mosaicism, pupal lethality, and gonadal dysgenic sterility. Unlike P cytotype, however, there was no reciprocal cross effect in the inheritance of repression.",1989,"H M Robertson, W R Engels, H M Robertson, W R Engels"
Genetics of inbred Drosophila melanogaster. XXII. Cytoplasmic influence on recombination,2517286,10.1111/j.1601-5223.1990.tb00400.x,"To examine the possible influence of various sources of cytoplasms on recombination in the major part of the X-chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster, tests were performed in intra- and inter-line crosses. Two to six sister lines of various types were included. It was shown that cytoplasms of various sources could have different effects in the distal y-cx region but not in the mid (cx-v) or the sub-proximal (v-f) regions in both intra- and inter-line crosses. There were no diversities between sister-lines that had been separated for over 100 generations. Tests of two sets of sister-lines with the same source of cytoplasm in which different genomes had been introduced confirmed the earlier finding that there is an interaction of chromosomal and cytoplasmic influences on recombination. It is shown that changes in one extrachromosomal element (R-elements) had no demonstrable consequences on the effect on recombination. The necessity to consider cytoplasmic-bound variability is stressed.",1989,"K G LÃ¼ning, K G LÃ¼ning"
Fine structure of a sensory organ in the arista of Drosophila melanogaster and some other dipterans,2510932,10.1007/BF00239448,"The arista, a characteristic appendage of dipteran antennae, consists of 2 short segments at the base and a long distal shaft. A small sensory ganglion, from which arises the aristal nerve, is located proximally in the shaft. The fine structure of the aristal sensory organ was studied in detail in the fruitfly (Drosophila) and for comparison in the housefly (Musca) and the blowfly (Calliphora). In Drosophila, the aristal sense organ consists of 3 identical sensilla that terminate in the hemolymph space of the aristal shaft, and not in an external cuticular apparatus. Each sensillum comprises 2 bipolar neurons and 2 sheath cells; a third sheath cell envelops the somata of all six neurons of the ganglion. The neurons have long slender dendrites with the usual subdivision into an inner and an outer segment. One of the outer segments is highly lamellated and bears small particles (BOSS-structures) on the outside of its cell membrane; the other outer segment is unbranched and has a small diameter. The fine structure of the first dendrite is strongly reminiscent of thermoreceptors known from the antennae of other insects. These thermoreceptors are often coupled with hygroreceptors; however, we can only speculate whether the second dendrite of the aristal organ also has this function. Our present results argue against mechanoreceptive functions, as formerly postulated. The aristal sense organs in Musca and Calliphora are similar to those in Drosophila, but contain more sensilla (12 in Musca, 18 in Calliphora.",1989,"R F Foelix, R F Stocker, R A Steinbrecht, R F Foelix, R F Stocker, R A Steinbrecht"
Mapping the Drosophila genome with yeast artificial chromosomes,2510296,10.1126/science.2510296,"The ability to clone large fragments of DNA in yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC's) has created the possibility of obtaining global physical maps of complex genomes. For this application to be feasible, most sequences in complex genomes must be able to be cloned in YAC's, and most clones must be genetically stable and colinear with the genomic sequences from which they originated (that is, not liable to undergo rearrangement). These requirements have been met with a YAC library containing DNA fragments from Drosophila melanogaster ranging in size up to several hundred kilobase pairs. Preliminary characterization of the Drosophila YAC library was carried out by in situ hybridization of random clones and analysis of clones containing known sequences. The results suggest that most euchromatic sequences can be cloned. The library also contains clones in which the inserted DNA is derived from the centromeric heterochromatin. The locations of 58 clones collectively representing about 8 percent of the euchromatic genome are presented.",1989,"D Garza, J W Ajioka, D T Burke, D L Hartl, D Garza, J W Ajioka, D T Burke, D L Hartl"
"Phenotypic and molecular analysis of the facets, a group of intronic mutations at the Notch locus of Drosophila melanogaster which affect postembryonic development",2548924,,"The function of the Notch locus of Drosophila melanogaster is essential for normal development both during embryogenesis and during postembryonic stages. In the embryo its function is necessary for the correct segregation of neural from epidermal lineages. During postembryonic stages Notch exhibits pleiotropic effects that are both tissue- and stage-specific. Here, we examine a group of six recessive mutations, the facets (fa, fa3, fag, fag-2, fafx and fasw), which affect eye morphology and have been previously shown to be associated with the insertion of transposable elements in an intronic region of Notch. The analysis of revertants has shown that the mutant phenotype depends on the presence of the transposable element and that the disruption of the wild-type sequence organization per se is not its cause. Four of these alleles, even though they are associated with the insertion of the same transposable element, display considerably different phenotypes. Therefore, no simple correlation exists between the mutant phenotype and the type of inserted element. A comparison of the tissue localization of the Notch and the transposable element transcripts revealed that in the third larval instar the elements are transcribed in both orientations in tissues in which Notch is also transcriptionally active. The complexity of the defects associated with the facet alleles, as well as the findings of the transcriptional analysis, indicate that a mutational mechanism based solely on transcriptional interference is not sufficient to explain the nature of the mutational event. It is likely that in these mutations alterations, in the temporal and/or spatial context caused by transcriptional and perhaps posttranscriptional interference mechanisms by the inserted elements, may be responsible for the mutant phenotype.",1989,"K Markopoulou, W J Welshons, S Artavanis-Tsakonas, K Markopoulou, W J Welshons, S Artavanis-Tsakonas"

We have shown that some but not all unstable P-element insertions in singed can form mosaics. The cause of this variation is not clear from studies of the restriction maps of the mutations tested. The transposable element movements occur early in development and require, in addition to an appropriate P-element insertion in singed, a trans-acting maternal effect component.

Reduced variation in the yellow-achaete-scute region in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster,17246506,,"Restriction map variation in 64 X chromosome lines extracted from three different populations of Drosophila melanogaster was investigated with seven six-nucleotide-recognizing restriction enzymes for a 106-kb region encompassing the yellow gene and the achaete-scute complex that is located in the region of reduced crossing over close to the telomere. Nine restriction site polymorphisms (out of 176 sites scored) and 19 length polymorphisms (15 insertions and 4 deletions) were detected.

In order to determine if this gene is inherently incapable of dosage compensation or if it does not compensate because the appropriate regulatory cis-acting sequences are absent from its chromosomal domain, we have undertaken to relocate it to ectopic sites on the X chromosome. To differentiate between the transcripts produced by the transduced gene and those produced by the indigenous gene, we inserted a 500-bp sequence of mouse DNA into the LSP1-alpha clone prior to using it for transformation. Our results show that the LSP1-alpha gene exhibits equivalent levels of transcripts in the two sexes when it is relocated to either an autosomal site or to an ectopic site on the X chromosome.

We have confirmed the importance of the proposed amplification control element (ACE3) and demonstrated that it can support low levels of follicular amplification in the absence of other elements, but that it lacks detectable activity as a DNA replication origin. We have also demonstrated the existence of additional amplification-enhancing regions (AERs), by analyzing the amplification levels of a series of in situ induced, nested deletions of the chorion cluster. These deletions were induced by P-transposase perturbation of a chorion transposon in a highly amplifying transformed line, and were not accompanied by re-transposition, making possible a quantitative analysis of amplification levels in the absence of chromosomal position effects. Analysis of endogenous replication intermediates in wild-type follicular DNA suggested that at least one of the AERs may be an origin of replication and that amplification uses at least one additional replication origin.",1989,"C Delidakis, F C Kafatos, C Delidakis, F C Kafatos"

However, studies have shown that symbionts often perform poorly in novel hosts. We hypothesized selection on the symbiont may be sufficiently rapid that poor performance in a novel host environment is rapidly ameliorated, permitting symbiont maintenance. Here, we test this prediction for a Spiroplasma strain transinfected into the novel host Drosophila melanogaster. In the generations immediately following transinfection, the symbiont had low transmission efficiency to offspring and imposed severe fitness costs on its host. We observed that effects on host fitness evolved rapidly, being undetectable after 17 generations in the novel host, whereas vertical transmission efficiency was poorly responsive over this period. Our results suggest that long-term symbiosis may more readily be established in cases where symbionts perform poorly in just one aspect of symbiosis.",2015,"S Nakayama, S R Parratt, K J Hutchence, Z Lewis, T A R Price, G D D Hurst, S Nakayama, S R Parratt, K J Hutchence, Z Lewis, T A R Price, G D D Hurst"
Metabolomic and Gene Expression Profiles Exhibit Modular Genetic and Dietary Structure Linking Metabolic Syndrome Phenotypes in Drosophila,26530416,10.1534/g3.115.023564,"Genetic and environmental factors influence complex disease in humans, such as metabolic syndrome, and Drosophila melanogaster serves as an excellent model in which to test these factors experimentally. Here we explore the modularity of endophenotypes with an in-depth reanalysis of a previous study by Reed et al. (2014), where we raised 20 wild-type genetic lines of Drosophila larvae on four diets and measured gross phenotypes of body weight, total sugar, and total triglycerides, as well as the endophenotypes of metabolomic and whole-genome expression profiles. We then perform new gene expression experiments to test for conservation of phenotype-expression correlations across different diets and populations. We find that transcript levels correlated with gross phenotypes were enriched for puparial adhesion, metamorphosis, and central energy metabolism functions. The specific metabolites L-DOPA and N-arachidonoyl dopamine make physiological links between the gross phenotypes across diets, whereas leucine and isoleucine thus exhibit genotype-by-diet interactions. Between diets, we find low conservation of the endophenotypes that correlate with the gross phenotypes. Through the follow-up expression study, we found that transcript-trait correlations are well conserved across populations raised on a familiar diet, but on a novel diet, the transcript-trait correlations are no longer conserved. Thus, physiological canalization of metabolic phenotypes breaks down in a novel environment exposing cryptic variation. We cannot predict the physiological basis of disease in a perturbing environment from profiles observed in the ancestral environment. This study demonstrates that variation for disease traits within a population is acquired through a multitude of physiological mechanisms, some of which transcend genetic and environmental influences, and others that are specific to an individual's genetic and environmental context.",2015,"Stephanie Williams, Kelly Dew-Budd, Kristen Davis, Julie Anderson, Ruth Bishop, Kenda Freeman, Dana Davis, Katherine Bray, Lauren Perkins, Joana Hubickey, Laura K Reed, Stephanie Williams, Kelly Dew-Budd, Kristen Davis, Julie Anderson, Ruth Bishop, Kenda Freeman, Dana Davis, Katherine Bray, Lauren Perkins, Joana Hubickey, Laura K Reed"
Multiple sexual selection pressures drive the rapid evolution of complex morphology in a male secondary genital structure,26664690,10.1002/ece3.1721,"The genitalia of internally fertilizing taxa represent a striking example of rapid morphological evolution. Although sexual selection can shape variation in genital morphology, it has been difficult to test whether multiple sexual selection pressures combine to drive the rapid evolution of individual genital structures. Here, we test the hypothesis that both pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection can act in concert to shape complex structural variation in secondary genital morphology. We genetically modified the size and shape of the posterior lobes of Drosophila melanogaster males and tested the consequences of morphological variation on several reproductive measures. We found that the posterior lobes are necessary for genital coupling and that they are also the targets of multiple postcopulatory processes that shape quantitative variation in morphology, even though these structures make no direct contact with the external female genitalia or internal reproductive organs during mating. We also found that males with smaller and less structurally complex posterior lobes suffer substantial fitness costs in competitive fertilization experiments. Our results show that sexual selection mechanisms can combine to shape the morphology of a single genital structure and that the posterior lobes of D. melanogaster are the targets of multiple postcopulatory selection pressures.",2015,"Stephen R Frazee, John P Masly, Stephen R Frazee, John P Masly"
Secondary taste neurons that convey sweet taste and starvation in the Drosophila brain,25661186,10.1016/j.neuron.2015.01.005,"The gustatory system provides vital sensory information to determine feeding and appetitive learning behaviors. Very little is known, however, about higher-order gustatory circuits in the highly tractable model for neurobiology, Drosophila melanogaster. Here we report second-order sweet gustatory projection neurons (sGPNs) in the Drosophila brain using a powerful behavioral screen. Silencing neuronal activity reduces appetitive behaviors, whereas inducible activation results in food acceptance via proboscis extensions. sGPNs show functional connectivity with Gr5a(+) sweet taste neurons and are activated upon sucrose application to the labellum. By tracing sGPN axons, we identify the antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC) as an immediate higher-order processing center for sweet taste. Interestingly, starvation increases sucrose sensitivity of the sGPNs in the AMMC, suggesting that hunger modulates the responsiveness of the secondary sweet taste relay.

Flies developed smaller cells when temperature fluctuated more frequently,26615732,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2014.09.010,"Changes in cell size might be an important component of adaptation to thermal heterogeneity. Although Drosophila melanogaster develops smaller cells at fluctuating temperatures, we do not know whether this response depends on the frequency or amplitude of thermal change. In a laboratory experiment, we exposed flies to either frequent or infrequent fluctuations between 17 and 27 Â°C, while controlling the total exposure to each temperature. Flies emerged from these treatments with similar body sizes, but flies at more frequent fluctuations emerged earlier and had smaller epidermal cells for a given body size. Tissue built from small cells has more nuclei for transcription, shorter distances between cell compartments, and a larger surface area for transport across membranes. Therefore, we hypothesize that physiological effects of small cells reduce lags in metabolic activity and enhance performance of flies during warming.

Pleiotropic actions of the male pheromone cis-vaccenyl acetate in Drosophila melanogaster,26105507,10.1007/s00359-015-1020-9,"The male-specific lipid, cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) has multiple functions in intra-species communication in Drosophila melanogaster. The presence of cVA in a male suppresses courtship motivation of other males and averts male-male courtship. Meanwhile, aggression behaviors between males are promoted by a high amount of cVA caused by increased densities of male flies. cVA also works as a modifier of courtship memory, which is suppressed courtship motivation driven by previous unsuccessful courtship experience. Conversely, cVA in the courting male stimulates female reproductive motivation and increases the probability of copulation success. It also works as an aggregation pheromone, attracting both males and females at the gathering spot. Thus, cVA is a unique example of a single molecule leading to different behaviors in response to the social context. However, despite recent advances in understanding the molecular and neural machinery for cVA sensing, it is still largely unknown how cVA triggers a specific behavior as the situation demands.

        Results:
      
    

    
      Here, we compare CBP chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data from Drosophila S2 cells with modENCODE data and show that CBP is bound at genomic sites with a wide range of functions. As expected, we find that CBP is bound at active promoters and enhancers. In addition, we find that the strongest CBP sites in the genome are found at Polycomb response elements embedded in histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylated (H3K27me3) chromatin, where they correlate with binding of the Pho repressive complex. Interestingly, we find that CBP also binds to most insulators in the genome. At a subset of these, CBP may regulate insulating activity, measured as the ability to prevent repressive H3K27 methylation from spreading into adjacent chromatin.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We conclude that CBP could be involved in a much wider range of functions than has previously been appreciated, including Polycomb repression and insulator activity. In addition, we discuss the possibility that a common role for CBP at all functional elements may be to regulate interactions between distant chromosomal regions and speculate that CBP is controlling higher order chromatin organization.",2015,"Philge Philip, Ann Boija, Roshan Vaid, Allison M Churcher, David J Meyers, Philip A Cole, Mattias Mannervik, Per Stenberg, Philge Philip, Ann Boija, Roshan Vaid, Allison M Churcher, David J Meyers, Philip A Cole, Mattias Mannervik, Per Stenberg"
Drosophila melanogaster mini spindles TOG3 utilizes unique structural elements to promote domain stability and maintain a TOG1- and TOG2-like tubulin-binding surface,25720490,10.1074/jbc.M114.633826,"Microtubule-associated proteins regulate microtubule (MT) dynamics spatially and temporally, which is essential for proper formation of the bipolar mitotic spindle. The XMAP215 family is comprised of conserved microtubule-associated proteins that use an array of tubulin-binding tumor overexpressed gene (TOG) domains, consisting of six (A-F) Huntingtin, elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, target of rapamycin (HEAT) repeats, to robustly increase MT plus-end polymerization rates. Recent work showed that TOG domains have differentially conserved architectures across the array, with implications for position-dependent TOG domain tubulin binding activities and function within the XMAP215 MT polymerization mechanism. Although TOG domains 1, 2, and 4 are well described, structural and mechanistic information characterizing TOG domains 3 and 5 is outstanding. Here, we present the structure and characterization of Drosophila melanogaster Mini spindles (Msps) TOG3. Msps TOG3 has two unique features as follows: the first is a C-terminal tail that stabilizes the ultimate four HEAT repeats (HRs), and the second is a unique architecture in HR B. Structural alignments of TOG3 with other TOG domain structures show that the architecture of TOG3 is most similar to TOG domains 1 and 2 and diverges from TOG4. Docking TOG3 onto recently solved Stu2 TOG1Â· and TOG2Â·tubulin complex structures suggests that TOG3 uses similarly conserved tubulin-binding intra-HEAT loop residues to engage Î±- and Î²-tubulin. This indicates that TOG3 has maintained a TOG1- and TOG2-like TOG-tubulin binding mode despite structural divergence. The similarity of TOG domains 1-3 and the divergence of TOG4 suggest that a TOG domain array with polarized structural diversity may play a key mechanistic role in XMAP215-dependent MT polymerization activity.",2015,"Amy E Howard, Jaime C Fox, Kevin C Slep, Amy E Howard, Jaime C Fox, Kevin C Slep"
The Atg1-Tor pathway regulates yolk catabolism in Drosophila embryos,26395483,10.1242/dev.125419,"Yolk provides an important source of nutrients during the early development of oviparous organisms. It is composed mainly of vitellogenin proteins packed into membrane-bound compartments called yolk platelets. Catabolism of yolk is initiated by acidification of the yolk platelet, leading to the activation of Cathepsin-like proteinases, but it is unknown how this process is triggered. Yolk catabolism initiates at cellularization in Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Using maternal shRNA technology we found that yolk catabolism depends on the Tor pathway and on the autophagy-initiating kinase Atg1. Whereas Atg1 was required for a burst of spatially regulated autophagy during late cellularization, autophagy was not required for initiating yolk catabolism. We propose that the conserved Tor metabolic sensing pathway regulates yolk catabolism, similar to Tor-dependent metabolic regulation on the lysosome.",2015,"Hallie Kuhn, Richelle Sopko, Margaret Coughlin, Norbert Perrimon, Tim Mitchison, Hallie Kuhn, Richelle Sopko, Margaret Coughlin, Norbert Perrimon, Tim Mitchison"
Regulation of a serine protease homolog by the JNK pathway during thoracic development of Drosophila melanogaster,25737837,10.1016/j.fob.2015.01.008,"The importance of the Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway during normal development and tumor invasion has been well documented in Drosophila. Here, this pathway plays important roles in epithelial morphogenesis, wound healing, apoptosis, immunity and regulation of lifespan. However, which downstream molecules facilitate these effects is not very well elucidated. In this study, data are presented on a serine protease homolog (SPH), scarface. These data show that scarface is under regulatory control of the JNK pathway and that this pathway is both necessary and sufficient for its expression within the context of thoracic development. Consequently, down-regulation of scarface results in a thoracic-cleft phenotype that phenocopies the JNK pathway defect. A possible role of scarface during thoracic development in Drosophila is discussed.",2015,"Ajay Srivastava, Qian Dong, Ajay Srivastava, Qian Dong"
[The Mechanisms Determining Bristle Pattern in Drosophila melanogaster],26204765,,"Macrochaetes (large bristles) are arranged on the drosophila head and notum in a specific bristle pattern. The number and positions of the macrochaetes forming the pattern are important species-specific characteristics, which are determined by a strict positioning of the proneural clusters in the in the imaginal disc ectoderm in the third instar larvae and prepupae. In turn, the positioning of proneural clusters depends on the distribution of the so-called prepattern factors, responsible for the bristle prepatterning. The current concept identifies the prepattern factors with the transcription factors that initiate the local expression of the achaete-scute complex (AS-C) genes. Expression of these genes confined to certain regions of the ectoderm is the particular factor that determines the macrochaete pattern on the adult fly body. The review considers and systematizes the data on establishment of the prepatterning as the final stage in the functioning of hierarchically organized molecular genetic system resulting in the local expression of AS-C genes in the ectoderm of imaginal discs.",2015,"T A Bukharina, D P Furman, T A Bukharina, D P Furman"

Dynamics of hnRNPs and omega speckles in normal and heat shocked live cell nuclei of Drosophila melanogaster,25663367,10.1007/s00412-015-0506-0,"The nucleus limited long-noncoding hsr?-n transcripts, hnRNPs, and some other RNA processing proteins organize nucleoplasmic omega speckles in Drosophila. Unlike other nuclear speckles, omega speckles rapidly disappear following cell stress, while hnRNPs and other associated proteins move away from chromosome sites, nucleoplasm, and the disappearing speckles to get uniquely sequestered at hsr? locus. Omega speckles reappear and hnRNPs get redistributed to normal locations during recovery from stress. With a view to understand the dynamics of omega speckles and their associated proteins, we used live imaging of GFP tagged hnRNPs (Hrb87F, Hrb98DE, or Squid) in unstressed and stressed Drosophila cells. Omega speckles display size-dependent mobility in nucleoplasmic domains with significant colocalization with nuclear matrix Tpr/Megator and SAFB proteins, which also accumulate at hsr? gene site after stress. Instead of moving towards the nuclear periphery located hsr? locus following heat shock or colchicine treatment, omega speckles rapidly disappear within nucleoplasm while chromosomal and nucleoplasmic hnRNPs move, stochastically or, more likely, by nuclear matrix-mediated transport to hsr? locus in non-particulate form. Continuing transcription of hsr? during cell stress is essential for sequestering incoming hnRNPs at the site. While recovering from stress, the sequestered hnRNPs are released as omega speckles in ISWI-dependent manner. Photobleaching studies reveal hnRNPs to freely move between nucleoplasm, omega speckles, chromosome regions, and hsr? gene site although their residence periods at chromosomes and hsr? locus are longer. A model for regulation of exchange of hnRNPs between nuclear compartments by hsr?-n transcripts is presented.",2015,"Anand K Singh, Subhash C Lakhotia, Anand K Singh, Subhash C Lakhotia"
Carboxylesterase-mediated insecticide resistance: Quantitative increase induces broader metabolic resistance than qualitative change,26047115,10.1016/j.pestbp.2014.12.016,"Carboxylesterases are mainly involved in the mediation of metabolic resistance of many insects to organophosphate (OP) insecticides. Carboxylesterases underwent two divergent evolutionary events: (1) quantitative mechanism characterized by the overproduction of carboxylesterase protein; and (2) qualitative mechanism caused by changes in enzymatic properties because of mutation from glycine/alanine to aspartate at the 151 site (G/A151D) or from tryptophan to leucine at the 271 site (W271L), following the numbering of Drosophila melanogaster AChE. Qualitative mechanism has been observed in few species. However, whether this carboxylesterase mutation mechanism is prevalent in insects remains unclear. In this study, wild-type, G/A151D and W271L mutant carboxylesterases from Culex pipiens and Aphis gossypii were subjected to germline transformation and then transferred to D. melanogaster. These germlines were ubiquitously expressed as induced by tub-Gal4. In carboxylesterase activity assay, the introduced mutant carboxylesterase did not enhance the overall carboxylesterase activity of flies. This result indicated that G/A151D or W271L mutation disrupted the original activities of the enzyme. Less than 1.5-fold OP resistance was only observed in flies expressing A. gossypii mutant carboxylesterases compared with those expressing A. gossypii wild-type carboxylesterase. However, transgenic flies universally showed low resistance to OP insecticides compared with non-transgenic flies. The flies expressing A. gossypii W271L mutant esterase exhibited 1.5-fold resistance to deltamethrin, a pyrethroid insecticide compared with non-transgenic flies. The present transgenic Drosophila system potentially showed that a quantitative increase in carboxylesterases induced broader resistance of insects to insecticides than a qualitative change.",2015,"Feng Cui, Mei-Xia Li, Hai-Jing Chang, Yun Mao, Han-Ying Zhang, Li-Xia Lu, Shuai-Guo Yan, Ming-Lin Lang, Li Liu, Chuan-Ling Qiao, Feng Cui, Mei-Xia Li, Hai-Jing Chang, Yun Mao, Han-Ying Zhang, Li-Xia Lu, Shuai-Guo Yan, Ming-Lin Lang, Li Liu, Chuan-Ling Qiao"
Experimental Evolution under Fluctuating Thermal Conditions Does Not Reproduce Patterns of Adaptive Clinal Differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster,26655772,10.1086/683252,"Experimental evolution can be a useful tool for testing the impact of environmental factors on adaptive changes in populations, and this approach is being increasingly used to understand the potential for evolutionary responses in populations under changing climates. However, selective factors will often be more complex in natural populations than in laboratory environments and produce different patterns of adaptive differentiation. Here we test the ability of laboratory experimental evolution under different temperature cycles to reproduce well-known patterns of clinal variation in Drosophila melanogaster. Six fluctuating thermal regimes mimicking the natural temperature conditions along the east coast of Australia were initiated. Contrary to expectations, on the basis of field patterns there was no evidence for adaptation to thermal regimes as reflected by changes in cold and heat resistance after 1-3 years of laboratory natural selection. While laboratory evolution led to changes in starvation resistance, development time, and body size, patterns were not consistent with those seen in natural populations. These findings highlight the complexity of factors affecting trait evolution in natural populations and indicate that caution is required when inferring likely evolutionary responses from the outcome of experimental evolution studies.",2015,"Vanessa Kellermann, Ary A Hoffmann, Torsten Nygaard Kristensen, Neda Nasiri Moghadam, Volker Loeschcke, Vanessa Kellermann, Ary A Hoffmann, Torsten Nygaard Kristensen, Neda Nasiri Moghadam, Volker Loeschcke"
The deubiquitinase ataxin-3 requires Rad23 and DnaJ-1 for its neuroprotective role in Drosophila melanogaster,26007638,10.1016/j.nbd.2015.05.010,"Ataxin-3 is a deubiquitinase and polyglutamine (polyQ) disease protein with a protective role in Drosophila melanogaster models of neurodegeneration. In the fruit fly, wild-type ataxin-3 suppresses toxicity from several polyQ disease proteins, including a pathogenic version of itself that causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and pathogenic huntingtin, which causes Huntington's disease. The molecular partners of ataxin-3 in this protective function are unclear. Here, we report that ataxin-3 requires its direct interaction with the ubiquitin-binding and proteasome-associated protein, Rad23 (known as hHR23A/B in mammals) in order to suppress toxicity from polyQ species in Drosophila. According to additional studies, ataxin-3 does not rely on autophagy or the proteasome to suppress polyQ-dependent toxicity in fly eyes. Instead this deubiquitinase, through its interaction with Rad23, leads to increased protein levels of the co-chaperone DnaJ-1 and depends on it to protect against degeneration. Through DnaJ-1, our data connect ataxin-3 and Rad23 to protective processes involved with protein folding rather than increased turnover of toxic polyQ species.",2015,"Wei-Ling Tsou, Michelle Ouyang, Ryan R Hosking, Joanna R Sutton, Jessica R Blount, Aaron A Burr, Sokol V Todi, Wei-Ling Tsou, Michelle Ouyang, Ryan R Hosking, Joanna R Sutton, Jessica R Blount, Aaron A Burr, Sokol V Todi"
Sex-specific trans-regulatory variation on the Drosophila melanogaster X chromosome,25679222,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005015,"The X chromosome constitutes a unique genomic environment because it is present in one copy in males, but two copies in females. This simple fact has motivated several theoretical predictions with respect to how standing genetic variation on the X chromosome should differ from the autosomes. Unmasked expression of deleterious mutations in males and a lower census size are expected to reduce variation, while allelic variants with sexually antagonistic effects, and potentially those with a sex-specific effect, could accumulate on the X chromosome and contribute to increased genetic variation. In addition, incomplete dosage compensation of the X chromosome could potentially dampen the male-specific effects of random mutations, and promote the accumulation of X-linked alleles with sexually dimorphic phenotypic effects. Here we test both the amount and the type of genetic variation on the X chromosome within a population of Drosophila melanogaster, by comparing the proportion of X linked and autosomal trans-regulatory SNPs with a sexually concordant and discordant effect on gene expression. We find that the X chromosome is depleted for SNPs with a sexually concordant effect, but hosts comparatively more SNPs with a sexually discordant effect. Interestingly, the contrasting results for SNPs with sexually concordant and discordant effects are driven by SNPs with a larger influence on expression in females than expression in males. Furthermore, the distribution of these SNPs is shifted towards regions where dosage compensation is predicted to be less complete. These results suggest that intrinsic properties of dosage compensation influence either the accumulation of different types of trans-factors and/or their propensity to accumulate mutations. Our findings document a potential mechanistic basis for sex-specific genetic variation, and identify the X as a reservoir for sexually dimorphic phenotypic variation. These results have general implications for X chromosome evolution, as well as the genetic basis of sex-specific evolutionary change.",2015,"Michael Stocks, Rebecca Dean, BjÃ¶rn Rogell, Urban Friberg, Michael Stocks, Rebecca Dean, BjÃ¶rn Rogell, Urban Friberg"

Robo2 acts in trans to inhibit Slit-Robo1 repulsion in pre-crossing commissural axons,26186094,10.7554/eLife.08407,"During nervous system development, commissural axons cross the midline despite the presence of repellant ligands. In Drosophila, commissural axons avoid premature responsiveness to the midline repellant Slit by expressing the endosomal sorting receptor Commissureless, which reduces surface expression of the Slit receptor Roundabout1 (Robo1). In this study, we describe a distinct mechanism to inhibit Robo1 repulsion and promote midline crossing, in which Roundabout2 (Robo2) binds to and prevents Robo1 signaling. Unexpectedly, we find that Robo2 is expressed in midline cells during the early stages of commissural axon guidance, and that over-expression of Robo2 can rescue robo2-dependent midline crossing defects non-cell autonomously. We show that the extracellular domains required for binding to Robo1 are also required for Robo2's ability to promote midline crossing, in both gain-of-function and rescue assays. These findings indicate that at least two independent mechanisms to overcome Slit-Robo1 repulsion in pre-crossing commissural axons have evolved in Drosophila.",2015,"Timothy A Evans, Celine Santiago, Elise Arbeille, Greg J Bashaw, Timothy A Evans, Celine Santiago, Elise Arbeille, Greg J Bashaw"
Drosophila Neuronal Injury Follows a Temporal Sequence of Cellular Events Leading to Degeneration at the Neuromuscular Junction,26512206,10.4137/JEN.S25516,"Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide, and as the global population ages, there is a critical need to improve our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive neurodegeneration. At the molecular level, neurodegeneration involves the activation of complex signaling pathways that drive the active destruction of neurons and their intracellular components. Here, we use an in vivo motor neuron injury assay to acutely induce neurodegeneration in order to follow the temporal order of events that occur following injury in Drosophila melanogaster. We find that sites of injury can be rapidly identified based on structural defects to the neuronal cytoskeleton that result in disrupted axonal transport. Additionally, the neuromuscular junction accumulates ubiquitinated proteins prior to the neurodegenerative events, occurring at 24 hours post injury. Our data provide insights into the early molecular events that occur during axonal and neuromuscular degeneration in a genetically tractable model organism. Importantly, the mechanisms that mediate neurodegeneration in flies are conserved in humans. Thus, these studies have implications for our understanding of the cellular and molecular events that occur in humans and will facilitate the identification of biomedically relevant targets for future treatments.",2015,"Barron L Lincoln 2nd, Sahar H Alabsi, Nicholas Frendo, Robert Freund, Lani C Keller, Barron L Lincoln 2nd, Sahar H Alabsi, Nicholas Frendo, Robert Freund, Lani C Keller"
Highly efficient cell-type-specific gene inactivation reveals a key function for the Drosophila FUS homolog cabeza in neurons,25772687,10.1038/srep09107,"To expand the rich genetic toolkit of Drosophila melanogaster, we evaluated whether introducing FRT or LoxP sites in endogenous genes could allow for cell-type-specific gene inactivation in both dividing and postmitotic cells by GAL4-driven expression of FLP or Cre recombinase. For proof of principle, conditional alleles were generated for cabeza (caz), the Drosophila homolog of human FUS, a gene implicated in the neurodegenerative disorders amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Upon selective expression in neurons or muscle, both FLP and Cre mediated caz inactivation in all neurons or muscle cells, respectively. Neuron-selective caz inactivation resulted in failure of pharate adult flies to eclose from the pupal case, and adult escapers displayed motor performance defects and reduced life span. Due to Cre-toxicity, FLP/FRT is the preferred system for cell-type-specific gene inactivation, and this strategy outperforms RNAi-mediated knock-down. Furthermore, the GAL80 target system allowed for temporal control over gene inactivation, as induction of FLP expression from the adult stage onwards still inactivated caz in >99% of neurons. Remarkably, selective caz inactivation in adult neurons did not affect motor performance and life span, indicating that neuronal caz is required during development, but not for maintenance of adult neuronal function.",2015,"Marie Frickenhaus, Marina Wagner, Moushami Mallik, Marica Catinozzi, Erik Storkebaum, Marie Frickenhaus, Marina Wagner, Moushami Mallik, Marica Catinozzi, Erik Storkebaum"

Notch signaling was activated to one side of these borders and was required for the identity, specializations and segregation of border cells.

      Carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration reaction of carbon dioxide. CAs are present as six structurally divergent enzyme families: Î±, Î², Î³, Î´, Î¶ and Î·. Î²-CAs have a wide distribution across different species including invertebrates. Previously, we showed that Drosophila melanogaster Î²-CA is a highly active mitochondrial enzyme. In this study, we investigated the function of Drosophila Î²-CA by silencing the expression of the Î²-CA gene using UAS/GAL4-based RNA interference (RNAi) in Drosophila in vivo.

Disruption of insect isoprenoid biosynthesis with pyridinium bisphosphonates,26073627,10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.05.006,"Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) catalyzes the condensation of the non-allylic diphosphate, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP; C5), with the allylic diphosphate primer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP; C5) to generate the C15 prenyl chain (FPP) used for protein prenylation as well as sterol and terpene biosynthesis. Here, we designed and prepared a series of pyridinium bisphosphonate (PyrBP) compounds, with the aim of selectively inhibiting FPPS of the lepidopteran insect order. FPPSs of Drosophila melanogaster and the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, were inhibited by several PyrBPs, and as hypothesized, larger bisphosphonates were more selective for the lepidopteran protein and completely inactive towards dipteran and vertebrate FPPSs. Cell growth of a D. melanogaster cell line was adversely affected by exposure to PyrPBs that were strongly inhibitory to insect FPPS, although their effect was less pronounced than that observed upon exposure to the electron transport disrupter, chlorfenapyr. To assess the impact of PyrBPs on lepidopteran insect growth and development, we performed feeding and topical studies, using the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, as our insect model. The free acid form of a PyrBP and a known bisphosphonate inhibitor of vertebrate FPPS, alendronate, had little to no effect on larval M. sexta; however, the topical application of more lipophilic ester PyrBPs caused decreased growth, incomplete larval molting, cuticle darkening at the site of application, and for those insects that survived, the formation of larval-pupal hybrids. To gain a better understanding of the structural differences that produce selective lepidopteran FPPS inhibition, homology models of C. fumiferana and D. melanogaster FPPS (CfFPPS2, and DmFPPS) were prepared.

By analogy with traits varying within a species and determined by genes, it is conjectured that intraspecific similarity is determined by genes, too. If so, mutations in these genes can be obtained. This paper provides a review of works published in 2000-2014 that: (1) propose breeding methods for detection of mutations in Drosophila melanogaster genes that lead intraspecific similarity; these mutations were called conditional; (2) describe collections of conditional mutations in chromosomes X, 2, and 3 of Drosophila; (3) show unusual features of epigenetic nature in the mutants; and (4) analyze these features of the mutants. Based on the peculiarities of manifestation it is supposed that the recognized conditional mutations occur in genes responsible for intraspecific similarity. The genes presumably belong to the so-called regulatory network of the Drosophila genome. This approach expands the scope of breeding analysis introduced by G. Mendel for heredity studies 150 years ago.",2015,"Boris F Chadov, Nina B Fedorova, Eugenia V Chadova, Boris F Chadov, Nina B Fedorova, Eugenia V Chadova"
Experimental evidence for the effect of habitat loss on the dynamics of migratory networks,25823745,10.1111/ele.12432,"Migratory animals present a unique challenge for understanding the consequences of habitat loss on population dynamics because individuals are typically distributed over a series of interconnected breeding and non-breeding sites (termed migratory network). Using replicated breeding and non-breeding populations of Drosophila melanogaster and a mathematical model, we investigated three hypotheses to explain how habitat loss influenced the dynamics of populations in networks with different degrees of connectivity between breeding and non-breeding seasons. We found that habitat loss increased the degree of connectivity in the network and influenced population size at sites that were not directly connected to the site where habitat loss occurred. However, connected networks only buffered global population declines at high levels of habitat loss. Our results demonstrate why knowledge of the patterns of connectivity across a species range is critical for predicting the effects of environmental change and provide empirical evidence for why connected migratory networks are commonly found in nature.",2015,"Gustavo S Betini, Mark J Fitzpatrick, D Ryan Norris, Gustavo S Betini, Mark J Fitzpatrick, D Ryan Norris"
Host Genetic Control of the Microbiota Mediates the Drosophila Nutritional Phenotype,26567306,10.1128/AEM.03301-15,"A wealth of studies has demonstrated that resident microorganisms (microbiota) influence the pattern of nutrient allocation to animal protein and energy stores, but it is unclear how the effects of the microbiota interact with other determinants of animal nutrition, including animal genetic factors and diet. Here, we demonstrate that members of the gut microbiota in Drosophila melanogaster mediate the effect of certain animal genetic determinants on an important nutritional trait, triglyceride (lipid) content. Parallel analysis of the taxonomic composition of the associated bacterial community and host nutritional indices (glucose, glycogen, triglyceride, and protein contents) in multiple Drosophila genotypes revealed significant associations between the abundance of certain microbial taxa, especially Acetobacteraceae and Xanthamonadaceae, and host nutritional phenotype. By a genome-wide association study of Drosophila lines colonized with a defined microbiota, multiple host genes were statistically associated with the abundance of one bacterium, Acetobacter tropicalis. Experiments using mutant Drosophila validated the genetic association evidence and reveal that host genetic control of microbiota abundance affects the nutritional status of the flies. These data indicate that the abundance of the resident microbiota is influenced by host genotype, with consequent effects on nutrient allocation patterns, demonstrating that host genetic control of the microbiome contributes to the genotype-phenotype relationship of the animal host.",2015,"John M Chaston, Adam J Dobson, Peter D Newell, Angela E Douglas, John M Chaston, Adam J Dobson, Peter D Newell, Angela E Douglas"
Structural implications of weak Ca2+ block in Drosophila cyclic nucleotide-gated channels,26283200,10.1085/jgp.201511431,"Calcium permeability and the concomitant calcium block of monovalent ion current (""Ca(2+) block"") are properties of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel fundamental to visual and olfactory signal transduction. Although most CNG channels bear a conserved glutamate residue crucial for Ca(2+) block, the degree of block displayed by different CNG channels varies greatly. For instance, the Drosophila melanogaster CNG channel shows only weak Ca(2+) block despite the presence of this glutamate. We previously constructed a series of chimeric channels in which we replaced the selectivity filter of the bacterial nonselective cation channel NaK with a set of CNG channel filter sequences and determined that the resulting NaK2CNG chimeras displayed the ion selectivity and Ca(2+) block properties of the parent CNG channels. Here, we used the same strategy to determine the structural basis of the weak Ca(2+) block observed in the Drosophila CNG channel. The selectivity filter of the Drosophila CNG channel is similar to that of most other CNG channels except that it has a threonine at residue 318 instead of a proline. We constructed a NaK chimera, which we called NaK2CNG-Dm, which contained the Drosophila selectivity filter sequence. The high resolution structure of NaK2CNG-Dm revealed a filter structure different from those of NaK and all other previously investigated NaK2CNG chimeric channels. Consistent with this structural difference, functional studies of the NaK2CNG-Dm chimeric channel demonstrated a loss of Ca(2+) block compared with other NaK2CNG chimeras. Moreover, mutating the corresponding threonine (T318) to proline in Drosophila CNG channels increased Ca(2+) block by 16 times. These results imply that a simple replacement of a threonine for a proline in Drosophila CNG channels has likely given rise to a distinct selectivity filter conformation that results in weak Ca(2+) block.",2015,"Yee Ling Lam, Weizhong Zeng, Mehabaw Getahun Derebe, Youxing Jiang, Yee Ling Lam, Weizhong Zeng, Mehabaw Getahun Derebe, Youxing Jiang"
The dominance effect of the adaptive transposable element insertion Bari-Jheh depends on the genetic background,25912044,10.1093/gbe/evv071,"Although adaptive mutations are often considered to be dominant, it has been recently shown that a substantial proportion of adaptive mutations should display heterozygote advantage. In this work, we take advantage of a recently characterized transposable element insertion mediating oxidative stress response in Drosophila melanogaster to test the dominance effect of an adaptive mutation. The comparison of the survival curves of heterozygous and the two corresponding homozygous flies indicated that the dominance effect of Bari-Jheh depends on the genetic background. Both in homozygous and in heterozygous flies, Bari-Jheh was associated with upregulation of Jheh1 (Juvenile Hormone Epoxyde Hydrolase 1) and/or Jheh2 genes.

Evolutionary Consequences of Male Driven Sexual Selection and Sex-Biased Fitness Modifications in Drosophila melanogaster and Members of the simulans Clade,26421208,10.1155/2015/756269,"Males have evolved a variety of behavioral, morphological, and physiological traits to manipulate their mates in order to maximize their chances of success. These traits are bound to influence how females respond to male behaviors and influence the nature of sexual selection/conflict. A common consequence of aggressive male mating strategies in Drosophila melanogaster is the reduction of female lifespan. Our study shows that this is common across members of the simulans clade. Reduced life expectancy of females implies that female contribution to a population is less than that of males per generation. Fitness differences between the sexes in every generation will invariably affect overall population fitness. How natural selection responds to the female deaths and thereby the unequal fitness of the sexes has rarely been addressed. We shed light on this issue and provide evidence, which suggests that additional gains of fitness by males due to their longevity and continued mating may provide one explanation as to why the loss of female fitness may be ""invisible"" (effectively neutral) to natural selection. Male driven sexual selection and additional, transgenerational gains of male fitness can be an important force of evolutionary change and need to be tested with other organisms.",2015,"Santosh Jagadeeshan, Wilfried Haerty, Monika Moglinicka, Abha Ahuja, Scot De Vito, Rama S Singh, Santosh Jagadeeshan, Wilfried Haerty, Monika Moglinicka, Abha Ahuja, Scot De Vito, Rama S Singh"

Active chromatin and transcription play a key role in chromosome partitioning into topologically associating domains,26518482,10.1101/gr.196006.115,"Recent advances enabled by the Hi-C technique have unraveled many principles of chromosomal folding that were subsequently linked to disease and gene regulation. In particular, Hi-C revealed that chromosomes of animals are organized into topologically associating domains (TADs), evolutionary conserved compact chromatin domains that influence gene expression. Mechanisms that underlie partitioning of the genome into TADs remain poorly understood. To explore principles of TAD folding in Drosophila melanogaster, we performed Hi-C and poly(A)(+) RNA-seq in four cell lines of various origins (S2, Kc167, DmBG3-c2, and OSC). Contrary to previous studies, we find that regions between TADs (i.e., the inter-TADs and TAD boundaries) in Drosophila are only weakly enriched with the insulator protein dCTCF, while another insulator protein Su(Hw) is preferentially present within TADs. However, Drosophila inter-TADs harbor active chromatin and constitutively transcribed (housekeeping) genes. Accordingly, we find that binding of insulator proteins dCTCF and Su(Hw) predicts TAD boundaries much worse than active chromatin marks do. Interestingly, inter-TADs correspond to decompacted inter-bands of polytene chromosomes, whereas TADs mostly correspond to densely packed bands. Collectively, our results suggest that TADs are condensed chromatin domains depleted in active chromatin marks, separated by regions of active chromatin. We propose the mechanism of TAD self-assembly based on the ability of nucleosomes from inactive chromatin to aggregate, and lack of this ability in acetylated nucleosomal arrays. Finally, we test this hypothesis by polymer simulations and find that TAD partitioning may be explained by different modes of inter-nucleosomal interactions for active and inactive chromatin.",2016,"Sergey V Ulianov, Ekaterina E Khrameeva, Alexey A Gavrilov, Ilya M Flyamer, Pavel Kos, Elena A Mikhaleva, Aleksey A Penin, Maria D Logacheva, Maxim V Imakaev, Alexander Chertovich, Mikhail S Gelfand, Yuri Y Shevelyov, Sergey V Razin, Sergey V Ulianov, Ekaterina E Khrameeva, Alexey A Gavrilov, Ilya M Flyamer, Pavel Kos, Elena A Mikhaleva, Aleksey A Penin, Maria D Logacheva, Maxim V Imakaev, Alexander Chertovich, Mikhail S Gelfand, Yuri Y Shevelyov, Sergey V Razin"

Non-Nutritive Polyol Sweeteners Differ in Insecticidal Activity When Ingested by Adult Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae),27271968,10.1093/jisesa/iew031,"Previous work showed the non-nutritive polyol sweetener Erythritol was toxic when ingested by Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen, 1930). This study assessed whether insect toxicity is a general property of polyols. Among tested compounds, toxicity was highest for erythritol. Adult fruit flies (D. melanogaster) fed erythritol had reduced longevity relative to controls. Other polyols did not reduce longevity; the only exception was a weaker but significant reduction of female (but not male) longevity when flies were fed D-mannitol. We conclude at least some non-nutritive polyols are not toxic to adult D. melanogaster when ingested for 17 days. The longer time course (relative to erythritol) and female specificity of D-mannitol mortality suggests different mechanisms for D-mannitol and erythritol toxicity to D. melanogaster.",2016,"Sean O'Donnell, Kaitlin Baudier, Daniel R Marenda"

The immune signaling pathways that respond to cytokines are remarkably conserved from fly to man.

Microenvironmental Gene Expression Plasticity Among Individual Drosophila melanogaster,27770026,10.1534/g3.116.035444,"Differences in phenotype among genetically identical individuals exposed to the same environmental condition are often noted in genetic studies. Despite this commonplace observation, little is known about the causes of this variability, which has been termed microenvironmental plasticity. One possibility is that stochastic or technical sources of variance produce these differences. A second possibility is that this variation has a genetic component. We have explored gene expression robustness in the transcriptomes of 730 individual Drosophila melanogaster of 16 fixed genotypes, nine of which are infected with Wolbachia Three replicates of flies were grown, controlling for food, day/night cycles, humidity, temperature, sex, mating status, social exposure, and circadian timing of RNA extraction. Despite the use of inbred genotypes, and carefully controlled experimental conditions, thousands of genes were differentially expressed, revealing a unique and dynamic transcriptional signature for each individual fly. We found that 23% of the transcriptome was differentially expressed among individuals, and that the variability in gene expression among individuals is influenced by genotype. This transcriptional variation originated from specific gene pathways, suggesting a plastic response to the microenvironment; but there was also evidence of gene expression differences due to stochastic fluctuations. These observations reveal previously unappreciated genetic sources of variability in gene expression among individuals, which has implications for complex trait genetics and precision medicine.",2016,"Yanzhu Lin, Zhen-Xia Chen, Brian Oliver, Susan T Harbison, Yanzhu Lin, Zhen-Xia Chen, Brian Oliver, Susan T Harbison"
Growth Coordination During Drosophila melanogaster Imaginal Disc Regeneration Is Mediated by Signaling Through the Relaxin Receptor Lgr3 in the Prothoracic Gland,27558136,10.1534/genetics.116.193706,"Damage to Drosophila melanogaster imaginal discs activates a regeneration checkpoint that (1) extends larval development and (2) coordinates the regeneration of the damaged disc with the growth of undamaged discs. These two systemic responses to damage are both mediated by Dilp8, a member of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor/relaxin family of peptide hormones, which is released by regenerating imaginal discs. Growth coordination between regenerating and undamaged imaginal discs is dependent on Dilp8 activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the prothoracic gland (PG), which slows the growth of undamaged discs by limiting ecdysone synthesis. Here we demonstrate that the Drosophila relaxin receptor homolog Lgr3, a leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor, is required for Dilp8-dependent growth coordination and developmental delay during the regeneration checkpoint. Lgr3 regulates these responses to damage via distinct mechanisms in different tissues. Using tissue-specific RNA-interference disruption of Lgr3 expression, we show that Lgr3 functions in the PG upstream of NOS, and is necessary for NOS activation and growth coordination during the regeneration checkpoint. When Lgr3 is depleted from neurons, imaginal disc damage no longer produces either developmental delay or growth inhibition. To reconcile these discrete tissue requirements for Lgr3 during regenerative growth coordination, we demonstrate that Lgr3 activity in both the CNS and PG is necessary for NOS activation in the PG following damage. Together, these results identify new roles for a relaxin receptor in mediating damage signaling to regulate growth and developmental timing.",2016,"Jacob S Jaszczak, Jacob B Wolpe, Rajan Bhandari, Rebecca G Jaszczak, Adrian Halme, Jacob S Jaszczak, Jacob B Wolpe, Rajan Bhandari, Rebecca G Jaszczak, Adrian Halme"
Arginine and proline applied as food additives stimulate high freeze tolerance in larvae of Drosophila melanogaster,27489218,10.1242/jeb.142158,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is an insect of tropical origin. Its larval stage is evolutionarily adapted for rapid growth and development under warm conditions and shows high sensitivity to cold. In this study, we further developed an optimal acclimation and freezing protocol that significantly improves larval freeze tolerance (an ability to survive at -5Â°C when most of the freezable fraction of water is converted to ice). Using the optimal protocol, freeze survival to adult stage increased from 0.7% to 12.6% in the larvae fed standard diet (agar, sugar, yeast, cornmeal). Next, we fed the larvae diets augmented with 31 different amino compounds, administered in different concentrations, and observed their effects on larval metabolomic composition, viability, rate of development and freeze tolerance. While some diet additives were toxic, others showed positive effects on freeze tolerance. Statistical correlation revealed tight association between high freeze tolerance and high levels of amino compounds involved in arginine and proline metabolism. Proline- and arginine-augmented diets showed the highest potential, improving freeze survival to 42.1% and 50.6%, respectively. Two plausible mechanisms by which high concentrations of proline and arginine might stimulate high freeze tolerance are discussed: (i) proline, probably in combination with trehalose, could reduce partial unfolding of proteins and prevent membrane fusions in the larvae exposed to thermal stress (prior to freezing) or during freeze dehydration; (ii) both arginine and proline are exceptional among amino compounds in their ability to form supramolecular aggregates which probably bind partially unfolded proteins and inhibit their aggregation under increasing freeze dehydration.",2016,"VladimÃ­r KoÅ¡tÃ¡l, Jaroslava KorbelovÃ¡, Rodolphe Poupardin, Martin Moos, Petr ?imek, VladimÃ­r KoÅ¡tÃ¡l, Jaroslava KorbelovÃ¡, Rodolphe Poupardin, Martin Moos, Petr ?imek"

Mitonuclear Epistasis for Development Time and Its Modification by Diet in Drosophila,26966258,10.1534/genetics.116.187286,"Mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear genes have to operate in a coordinated manner to maintain organismal function, and the regulation of this homeostasis presents a substantial source of potential epistatic (G ?

Here we developed a novel mitonuclear epistasis model, using selected strains of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and mitochondrial genomes from within Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans to test the hypothesis that mtDNA ? nDNA interactions influence fitness. In total we built 72 genotypes (12 nuclear backgrounds ? 6 mtDNA haplotypes, with 3 from each species) to dissect the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Each genotype was assayed on four food environments. We found considerable variation in several phenotypes, including development time and egg-to-adult viability, and this variation was partitioned into genetic (G), environmental (E), and higher-order (G ? G, G ? E, and G ? G ? E) components. Food type had a significant impact on development time and also modified mitonuclear epistases, evidencing a broad spectrum of G ? G ? E across these genotypes. Nuclear background effects were substantial, followed by mtDNA effects and their G ? G interaction. The species of mtDNA haplotype had negligible effects on phenotypic variation and there was no evidence that mtDNA variation has different effects on male and female fitness traits.

The rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against plant horseradish peroxidase (anti-HRP) is able to recognize the Î±1,3-linked fucose epitope and is also known to specifically stain neural tissues in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, we have detected and localized the anti-HRP cross-reactivity in another insect species, the malaria mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae.

#NAME?,27799369,10.1083/jcb.201608025,"Contraction of actomyosin rings during cytokinesis is typically attributed to actin filaments sliding toward each other via Myosin-2 motor activity. However, rings constrict in some cells in the absence of Myosin-2 activity. Thus, ring closure uses Myosin-2-dependent and -independent mechanisms. But what the Myosin-2-independent mechanisms are, and to what extent they are sufficient to drive closure, remains unclear. During cleavage in Drosophila melanogaster embryos, actomyosin rings constrict in two sequential and mechanistically distinct phases. We show that these phases differ in constriction speed and are genetically and pharmacologically separable. Further, Myosin-2 activity is required for slow constriction in ""phase 1"" but is largely dispensable for fast constriction in ""phase 2,"" and F-actin disassembly is only required for fast constriction in phase 2. Switching from phase 1 to phase 2 seemingly relies on the spatial organization of F-actin as controlled by Cofilin, Anillin, and Septin.

The genetic architecture of resistance to virus infection in Drosophila,27460507,10.1111/mec.13769,"Variation in susceptibility to infection has a substantial genetic component in natural populations, and it has been argued that selection by pathogens may result in it having a simpler genetic architecture than many other quantitative traits. This is important as models of host-pathogen co-evolution typically assume resistance is controlled by a small number of genes. Using the Drosophila melanogaster multiparent advanced intercross, we investigated the genetic architecture of resistance to two naturally occurring viruses, the sigma virus and DCV (Drosophila C virus). We found extensive genetic variation in resistance to both viruses. For DCV resistance, this variation is largely caused by two major-effect loci. Sigma virus resistance involves more genes - we mapped five loci, and together these explained less than half the genetic variance. Nonetheless, several of these had a large effect on resistance. Models of co-evolution typically assume strong epistatic interactions between polymorphisms controlling resistance, but we were only able to detect one locus that altered the effect of the main effect loci we had mapped. Most of the loci we mapped were probably at an intermediate frequency in natural populations. Overall, our results are consistent with major-effect genes commonly affecting susceptibility to infectious diseases, with DCV resistance being a near-Mendelian trait.",2016,"Rodrigo Cogni, Chuan Cao, Jonathan P Day, Calum Bridson, Francis M Jiggins, Rodrigo Cogni, Chuan Cao, Jonathan P Day, Calum Bridson, Francis M Jiggins"

Using mass spectrometry, we identified eight phosphorylation sites within a 29 amino acid segment in the N-terminal region of D. melanogaster flightin. We show that phosphorylation of D. melanogaster flightin is modulated during flight and, through a comparative analysis to orthologs from other Drosophila species, we found phosphorylation sites that remain invariant, sites that retain the charge character, and sites that are clade-specific. While the number of predicted phosphorylation sites differs across species, we uncovered a conserved pattern that relates the number of phosphorylation sites to pI and ID. Extending the analysis to orthologs of other insects, we found additional conserved features in flightin despite the near absence of sequence identity.

In this study, we report a mechanism by which Drosophila melanogaster larval motor neurons stabilize hyperactivity induced by the loss of the delayed rectifying K+ channel Shaker cognate B (Shab), by upregulating the Ca2+-dependent K+ channel encoded by the slowpoke (slo) gene. We also show that loss of SLO does not trigger a reciprocal compensatory upregulation of SHAB, implying that homeostatic signaling pathways utilize compensatory pathways unique to the channel that was mutated. SLO upregulation due to loss of SHAB involves nuclear Ca2+ signaling and dCREB, suggesting that the slo homeostatic response is transcriptionally mediated. Examination of the changes in gene expression induced by these mutations suggests that there is not a generic transcriptional response to increased excitability in motor neurons, but that homeostatic compensations are influenced by the identity of the lost conductance.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The idea that activity-dependent homeostatic plasticity is driven solely by firing has wide credence. In this report we show that homeostatic compensation after loss of an ion channel conductance is tailored to identity of the channel lost, not its properties.",2017,"Eugene Z Kim, Julie Vienne, Michael Rosbash, Leslie C Griffith, Eugene Z Kim, Julie Vienne, Michael Rosbash, Leslie C Griffith"
A Drosophila model for developmental nicotine exposure,28498868,10.1371/journal.pone.0177710,"Despite the known health risks of tobacco smoking, many people including pregnant women continue smoking. The effects of developmental nicotine exposure are known, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Drosophila melanogaster is a model organism that can be used for uncovering genetic and molecular mechanisms for drugs of abuse. Here I show that Drosophila can be a model to elucidate the mechanisms for nicotine's effects on a developing organism. Drosophila reared on nicotine food display developmental and behavioral effects similar to those in mammals including decreased survival and weight, increased developmental time, and decreased sensitivity to acute nicotine and ethanol. The Drosophila nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha 7 (DÎ±7) mediates some of these effects. A novel role for DÎ±7 on ethanol sedation in Drosophila is also shown. Future research taking advantage of the genetic and molecular tools for Drosophila will allow additional discovery of the mechanisms behind the effects of nicotine during development.",2017,"Norma Andrea Velazquez-Ulloa, Norma Andrea Velazquez-Ulloa"

Odorant Receptor Desensitization in Insects,29308015,10.1177/1179069517748600,"Insects and other arthropods transmit devastating human diseases, and these vectors use chemical senses to target humans. Understanding how these animals detect, respond, and adapt to volatile odorants may lead to novel ways to disrupt host localization or mate recognition in these pests. The past decade has led to remarkable progress in understanding odorant detection in arthropods. Insects use odorant-gated ion channels, first discovered in Drosophila melanogaster, to detect volatile chemicals. In flies, 60 ""tuning"" receptor subunits combine with a common subunit, Orco (odorant receptor coreceptor) to form ligand-gated ion channels. The mechanisms underlying odorant receptor desensitization in insects are largely unknown. Recent work reveals that dephosphorylation of serine 289 on the shared Orco subunit is responsible for slow, odor-induced receptor desensitization. Dephosphorylation has no effect on the localization of the receptor protein, and activation of the olfactory neurons in the absence of odor is sufficient to induce dephosphorylation and desensitization. These findings reveal a major component of receptor modulation in this important group of disease vectors, and implicate a second messenger feedback mechanism in this process.",2017,"Hao Guo, Dean P Smith, Hao Guo, Dean P Smith"
Starvation but not locomotion enhances heart robustness in Drosophila,28285040,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.03.004,"Insects and vertebrates have multiple major physiological systems, each species having a circulatory system, a metabolic system, and a respiratory system that enable locomotion and survival in stressful environments, among other functions. Broadening our understanding of the physiology of Drosophila melanogaster requires the parsing of interrelationships among such major component physiological systems. By combining electrical pacing and flight exhaustion assays with manipulative conditioning, we have started to unpack the interrelationships between cardiac function, locomotor performance, and other functional characters such as starvation and desiccation resistance. Manipulative sequences incorporating these four physiological characters were applied to five D. melanogaster lab populations that share a common origin from the wild and a common history of experimental evolution. While exposure to starvation or desiccation significantly reduced flight duration, exhaustion due to flight only affected subsequent desiccation resistance. A strong association was found between flight duration and desiccation resistance, providing additional support for the hypothesis that these traits depend on glycogen and water content. However, there was negligible impact on rate of cardiac arrests from exhaustion by flight or exposure to desiccant. Brief periods of starvation significantly lowered the rate of cardiac arrest. These results provide suggestive support for the adverse impact of lipids on Drosophila heart robustness, a parallel result to those of many comparable studies in human cardiology.

The role of species-specific sensory cues in male responses to mating rivals in Drosophila melanogaster fruitflies,29187965,10.1002/ece3.3455,"Complex sets of cues can be important in recognizing and responding to conspecific mating competitors and avoiding potentially costly heterospecific competitive interactions. Within Drosophila melanogaster, males can detect sensory inputs from conspecifics to assess the level of competition. They respond to rivals by significantly extending mating duration and gain significant fitness benefits from doing so. Here, we tested the idea that the multiple sensory cues used by D. melanogaster males to detect conspecifics also function to minimize ""off-target"" responses to heterospecific males that they might encounter (Drosophila simulans, Drosophila yakuba, Drosophila pseudoobscura, or Drosophila virilis). Focal D. melanogaster males exposed to D. simulans or D. pseudoobscura subsequently increased mating duration, but to a lesser extent than following exposure to conspecific rivals. The magnitude of rivals' responses expressed by D. melanogaster males did not align with genetic distance between species, and none of the sensory manipulations caused D. melanogaster to respond to males of all other species tested. However, when we removed or provided ""false"" sensory cues, D. melanogaster males became more likely to show increased mating duration responses to heterospecific males. We suggest that benefits of avoiding inaccurate assessment of the competitive environment may shape the evolution of recognition cues.",2017,"Amanda Bretman, James Rouse, James D Westmancoat, Tracey Chapman"

Dissection of the Drosophila neuropeptide F circuit using a high-throughput two-choice assay,28874527,10.1073/pnas.1710552114,"In their classic experiments, Olds and Milner showed that rats learn to lever press to receive an electric stimulus in specific brain regions. This led to the identification of mammalian reward centers. Our interest in defining the neuronal substrates of reward perception in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster prompted us to develop a simpler experimental approach wherein flies could implement behavior that induces self-stimulation of specific neurons in their brains. The high-throughput assay employs optogenetic activation of neurons when the fly occupies a specific area of a behavioral chamber, and the flies' preferential occupation of this area reflects their choosing to experience optogenetic stimulation. Flies in which neuropeptide F (NPF) neurons are activated display preference for the illuminated side of the chamber. We show that optogenetic activation of NPF neuron is rewarding in olfactory conditioning experiments and that the preference for NPF neuron activation is dependent on NPF signaling. Finally, we identify a small subset of NPF-expressing neurons located in the dorsomedial posterior brain that are sufficient to elicit preference in our assay. This assay provides the means for carrying out unbiased screens to map reward neurons in flies.",2017,"Lisha Shao, Mathias Saver, Phuong Chung, Qingzhong Ren, Tzumin Lee, Clement F Kent, Ulrike Heberlein, Lisha Shao, Mathias Saver, Phuong Chung, Qingzhong Ren, Tzumin Lee, Clement F Kent, Ulrike Heberlein"
The Immune Phenotype of Three Drosophila Leukemia Models,28476910,10.1534/g3.117.039487,"Many leukemia patients suffer from dysregulation of their immune system, making them more susceptible to infections and leading to general weakening (cachexia). Both adaptive and innate immunity are affected. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has an innate immune system, including cells of the myeloid lineage (hemocytes). To study Drosophila immunity and physiology during leukemia, we established three models by driving expression of a dominant-active version of the Ras oncogene (RasV12 ) alone or combined with knockdowns of tumor suppressors in Drosophila hemocytes. Our results show that phagocytosis, hemocyte migration to wound sites, wound sealing, and survival upon bacterial infection of leukemic lines are similar to wild type. We find that in all leukemic models the two major immune pathways (Toll and Imd) are dysregulated. Toll-dependent signaling is activated to comparable extents as after wounding wild-type larvae, leading to a proinflammatory status. In contrast, Imd signaling is suppressed. Finally, we notice that adult tissue formation is blocked and degradation of cell masses during metamorphosis of leukemic lines, which is akin to the state of cancer-dependent cachexia. To further analyze the immune competence of leukemic lines, we used a natural infection model that involves insect-pathogenic nematodes. We identified two leukemic lines that were sensitive to nematode infections. Further characterization demonstrates that despite the absence of behavioral abnormalities at the larval stage, leukemic larvae show reduced locomotion in the presence of nematodes. Taken together, this work establishes new Drosophila models to study the physiological, immunological, and behavioral consequences of various forms of leukemia.",2017,"Badrul Arefin, Martin Kunc, Robert Krautz, Ulrich Theopold, Badrul Arefin, Martin Kunc, Robert Krautz, Ulrich Theopold"
Naturally Segregating Variation at Ugt86Dd Contributes to Nicotine Resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,28743761,10.1534/genetics.117.300058,"Identifying the sequence polymorphisms underlying complex trait variation is a key goal of genetics research, since knowing the precise causative molecular events allows insight into the pathways governing trait variation. Genetic analysis of complex traits in model systems regularly starts by constructing QTL maps, but generally fails to identify causative sequence polymorphisms. Previously we mapped a series of QTL contributing to resistance to nicotine in a Drosophila melanogaster multiparental mapping resource and here use a battery of functional tests to resolve QTL to the molecular level. One large-effect QTL resided over a cluster of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and quantitative complementation tests using deficiencies eliminating subsets of these detoxification genes revealed allelic variation impacting resistance. RNAseq showed that Ugt86Dd had significantly higher expression in genotypes that are more resistant to nicotine, and anterior midgut-specific RNA interference (RNAi) of this gene reduced resistance. We discovered a segregating 22-bp frameshift deletion in Ugt86Dd, and accounting for the InDel during mapping largely eliminates the QTL, implying the event explains the bulk of the effect of the mapped locus. CRISPR/Cas9 editing of a relatively resistant genotype to generate lesions in Ugt86Dd that recapitulate the naturally occurring putative loss-of-function allele, leads to a large reduction in resistance. Despite this major effect of the deletion, the allele appears to be very rare in wild-caught populations and likely explains only a small fraction of the natural variation for the trait. Nonetheless, this putatively causative coding InDel can be a launchpad for future mechanistic exploration of xenobiotic detoxification.",2017,"Chad A Highfill, Jonathan H Tran, Samantha K T Nguyen, Taylor R Moldenhauer, Xiaofei Wang, Stuart J Macdonald, Chad A Highfill, Jonathan H Tran, Samantha K T Nguyen, Taylor R Moldenhauer, Xiaofei Wang, Stuart J Macdonald"
A receptor and neuron that activate a circuit limiting sucrose consumption,28332980,10.7554/eLife.24992,"The neural control of sugar consumption is critical for normal metabolism. In contrast to sugar-sensing taste neurons that promote consumption, we identify a taste neuron that limits sucrose consumption in Drosophila. Silencing of the neuron increases sucrose feeding; optogenetic activation decreases it.

The IR60b phenotype shows a high degree of chemical specificity when tested with a broad panel of tastants. An automated analysis of feeding behavior in freely moving flies shows that IR60b limits the duration of individual feeding bouts. This receptor and neuron provide the molecular and cellular underpinnings of a new element in the circuit logic of feeding regulation. We propose a dynamic model in which sucrose acts via IR60b to activate a circuit that inhibits feeding and prevents overconsumption.",2017,"Ryan M Joseph, Jennifer S Sun, Edric Tam, John R Carlson, Ryan M Joseph, Jennifer S Sun, Edric Tam, John R Carlson"
Maximum Likelihood Implementation of an Isolation-with-Migration Model for Three Species,27486180,10.1093/sysbio/syw063,"We develop a maximum likelihood (ML) method for estimating migration rates between species using genomic sequence data. A species tree is used to accommodate the phylogenetic relationships among three species, allowing for migration between the two sister species, while the third species is used as an out-group. A Markov chain characterization of the genealogical process of coalescence and migration is used to integrate out the migration histories at each locus analytically, whereas Gaussian quadrature is used to integrate over the coalescent times on each genealogical tree numerically. This is an extension of our early implementation of the symmetrical isolation-with-migration model for three species to accommodate arbitrary loci with two or three sequences per locus and to allow asymmetrical migration rates. Our implementation can accommodate tens of thousands of loci, making it feasible to analyze genome-scale data sets to test for gene flow. We calculate the posterior probabilities of gene trees at individual loci to identify genomic regions that are likely to have been transferred between species due to gene flow. We conduct a simulation study to examine the statistical properties of the likelihood ratio test for gene flow between the two in-group species and of the ML estimates of model parameters such as the migration rate. Inclusion of data from a third out-group species is found to increase dramatically the power of the test and the precision of parameter estimation. We compiled and analyzed several genomic data sets from the Drosophila fruit flies. Our analyses suggest no migration from D. melanogaster to D. simulans, and a significant amount of gene flow from D. simulans to D. melanogaster, at the rate of ~0.02 migrant individuals per generation.

In this study, we revisited TAS structural and functional dynamics in D. melanogaster and in related species. In silico analysis revealed that TAS-R family members are composed of previously uncharacterized domains. This analysis also showed that TAS-L repeats are composed of arrays of a region we have named ""TAS-L like"" (TLL) identified specifically in one TAS-R family member, X-TAS. TLL were also present in other species of the melanogaster subgroup. Therefore, it is possible that TLL represents an ancestral subtelomeric piRNA core-cluster. Furthermore, all D. melanogaster genomes tested possessed at least one TAS-R locus, whereas TAS-L can be absent. A screen of 110 D. melanogaster lines showed that X-TAS is always present in flies living in the wild, but often absent in long-term laboratory stocks and that natural populations frequently lost their X-TAS within 2 years upon lab conditioning.

Mechanical Control of Whole Body Shape by a Single Cuticular Protein Obstructor-E in Drosophila melanogaster,28076349,10.1371/journal.pgen.1006548,"Body shapes are much more variable than body plans. One way to alter body shapes independently of body plans would be to mechanically deform bodies. To what extent body shapes are regulated physically, or molecules involved in physical control of morphogenesis, remain elusive. During fly metamorphosis, the cuticle (exoskeleton) covering the larval body contracts longitudinally and expands laterally to become the ellipsoidal pupal case (puparium). Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster Obstructor-E (Obst-E) is a protein constituent of the larval cuticle that confers the oriented contractility/expandability. In the absence of obst-E function, the larval cuticle fails to undergo metamorphic shape change and finally becomes a twiggy puparium. We present results indicating that Obst-E regulates the arrangement of chitin, a long-chain polysaccharide and a central component of the insect cuticle, and directs the formation of supracellular ridges on the larval cuticle. We further show that Obst-E is locally required for the oriented shape change of the cuticle during metamorphosis, which is associated with changes in the morphology of those ridges. Thus, Obst-E dramatically affects the body shape in a direct, physical manner by controlling the mechanical property of the exoskeleton.",2017,"Reiko Tajiri, Nobuhiro Ogawa, Haruhiko Fujiwara, Tetsuya Kojima, Reiko Tajiri, Nobuhiro Ogawa, Haruhiko Fujiwara, Tetsuya Kojima"

Here, we determine the developmental fate of a population of precursor cells in the developing Drosophila melanogaster retina that arrest in G2 phase of the cell cycle and investigate whether cell cycle phase-specific arrest influences the fate of these cells. We demonstrate that retinal precursor cells that arrest in G2 during larval development are selected as sensory organ precursors (SOPs) during pupal development and undergo two cell divisions to generate the four-cell interommatidial mechanosensory bristles. While G2 arrest is not required for bristle development, preventing G2 arrest results in incorrect bristle positioning in the adult eye. We conclude that G2-arrested cells provide a positional cue during development to ensure proper spacing of bristles in the eye.

"Human TTBK1, TTBK2 and MARK1 kinase toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster is exacerbated by co-expression of human Tau",28711868,10.1242/bio.022749,"Tau protein is involved in numerous human neurodegenerative diseases, and Tau hyper-phosphorylation has been linked to Tau aggregation and toxicity. Previous studies have addressed toxicity and phospho-biology of human Tau (hTau) in Drosophila melanogaster However, hTau transgenes have most often been randomly inserted in the genome, thus making it difficult to compare between different hTau isoforms and phospho-mutants. In addition, many studies have expressed hTau also in mitotic cells, causing non-physiological toxic effects. Here, we overcome these confounds by integrating UAS-hTau isoform transgenes into specific genomic loci, and express hTau post-mitotically in the Drosophila nervous system. Lifespan and locomotor analyses show that all six of the hTau isoforms elicit similar toxicity in flies, although hTau2N3R showed somewhat elevated toxicity. To determine if Tau phosphorylation is responsible for toxicity, we analyzed the effects of co-expressing hTau isoforms together with Tau-kinases, focusing on TTBK1, TTBK2 and MARK1. We observed toxicity when expressing each of the three kinases alone, or in combination. Kinase toxicity was enhanced by hTau co-expression, with strongest co-toxicity for TTBK1. Mutagenesis and phosphorylation analysis indicates that hTau-MARK1 combinatorial toxicity may be due to direct phosphorylation of hTau, while hTau-TTBK1/2 combinatorial toxicity may result from independent toxicity mechanisms.",2017,"Josefin Fernius, Annika Starkenberg, Malgorzata Pokrzywa, Stefan Thor, Josefin Fernius, Annika Starkenberg, Malgorzata Pokrzywa, Stefan Thor"
The Exon Junction Complex and Srp54 Contribute to Hedgehog Signaling via ci RNA Splicing in Drosophila melanogaster,28637711,10.1534/genetics.117.202457,"Hedgehog (Hh) regulates the Cubitus interruptus (Ci) transcription factor in Drosophila melanogaster by activating full-length Ci-155 and blocking processing to the Ci-75 repressor. However, the interplay between the regulation of Ci-155 levels and activity, as well as processing-independent mechanisms that affect Ci-155 levels, have not been explored extensively. Here, we identified Mago Nashi (Mago) and Y14 core Exon Junction Complex (EJC) proteins, as well as the Srp54 splicing factor, as modifiers of Hh pathway activity under sensitized conditions. Mago inhibition reduced Hh pathway activity by altering the splicing pattern of ci to reduce Ci-155 levels. Srp54 inhibition also affected pathway activity by reducing ci RNA levels but additionally altered Ci-155 levels and activity independently of ci splicing. Further tests using ci transgenes and ci mutations confirmed evidence from studying the effects of Mago and Srp54 that relatively small changes in the level of Ci-155 primary translation product alter Hh pathway activity under a variety of sensitized conditions. We additionally used ci transgenes lacking intron sequences or the presumed translation initiation codon for an alternatively spliced ci RNA to provide further evidence that Mago acts principally by modulating the levels of the major ci RNA encoding Ci-155, and to show that ci introns are necessary to support the production of sufficient Ci-155 for robust Hh signaling and may also be important mediators of regulatory inputs.",2017,"Elisa Garcia-Garcia, Jamie C Little, Daniel Kalderon, Elisa Garcia-Garcia, Jamie C Little, Daniel Kalderon"

MAPK signaling promotes axonal degeneration by speeding the turnover of the axonal maintenance factor NMNAT2,28095293,10.7554/eLife.22540,"Injury-induced (Wallerian) axonal degeneration is regulated via the opposing actions of pro-degenerative factors such as SARM1 and a MAPK signal and pro-survival factors, the most important of which is the NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT2 that inhibits activation of the SARM1 pathway. Here we investigate the mechanism by which MAPK signaling facilitates axonal degeneration. We show that MAPK signaling promotes the turnover of the axonal survival factor NMNAT2 in cultured mammalian neurons as well as the Drosophila ortholog dNMNAT in motoneurons. The increased levels of NMNAT2 are required for the axonal protection caused by loss of MAPK signaling. Regulation of NMNAT2 by MAPK signaling does not require SARM1, and so cannot be downstream of SARM1. Hence, pro-degenerative MAPK signaling functions upstream of SARM1 by limiting the levels of the essential axonal survival factor NMNAT2 to promote injury-dependent SARM1 activation. These findings are consistent with a linear molecular pathway for the axonal degeneration program.",2017,"Lauren J Walker, Daniel W Summers, Yo Sasaki, E J Brace, Jeffrey Milbrandt, Aaron DiAntonio, Lauren J Walker, Daniel W Summers, Yo Sasaki, E J Brace, Jeffrey Milbrandt, Aaron DiAntonio"

The results showed that entire copies of mdg4, as part of pTiC58 T-DNA, were stably maintained in tobacco cells upon continuous culturing of transformed tumour lines on hormone-free medium.

The data indicate that populations of D. melanogaster vary in mating properties, but a common tendency was found in all of them: the heterozygous individuals, especially the males, show a relative advantage with respect to homozygotes. On the other hand, our results suggest that the differences in mating patterns observed between populations may be correlated with the different degree of Adh polymorphism found in them.",1988,"J A SÃ¡nchez Prado, G Blanco Lizana"
Natural selection with nuclear and cytoplasmic transmission. III. Joint analysis of segregation and mtDNA in Drosophila melanogaster,3130289,,"Despite the widespread use of mitochondrial DNA by evolutionary geneticists, relatively little effort has been spent assessing the magnitude of forces maintaining mtDNA sequence diversity. In this study the influence of cytoplasmic variation on viability in Drosophila was examined by analysis of second chromosome segregation. A factorial experiment with balancer chromosomes permitted the effects of cytoplasma and reciprocal crosses to be individually distinguished. The first test used six lines of diverse geographic origin, testing the segregation of all six second chromosomes in all six cytoplasms. The second and third tests were also factorial designs, but used flies from one population in central Pennsylvania. The fourth test was a large chain cross, using 28 lines from the same Pennsylvania population. Only the first test detected a significant nuclear-cytoplasmic effect. Restriction site variation in the mtDNA of all of these lines was assayed by Southern blotting, and statistical tests were performed in an effort to detect an influence of mtDNA type on fitness components. Posterior linear contrasts revealed an effect of mtDNA on segregation only among lines of diverse geographic origin. Within a population, no such influence was detected, even though the experiment was sufficiently large to have revealed statistical significance of a 0.5% segregation difference with a 57% probability.",1988,"A G Clark, E M Lyckegaard, A G Clark, E M Lyckegaard"
A genetic analysis of male-predominant pheromones in Drosophila melanogaster,3136054,,"Chemical signals from males play an important role in stimulating Drosophila melanogaster females to mate, and male-predominant pheromones may influence a female's choice of mates. Male-predominant pheromones also inhibit courtship, thereby functioning as antiaphrodisiacs. Interstrain variation in the ratio of two male-predominant pheromones (7-tricosene and 7-pentacosene) has been reported, but the genetic basis for this potentially important variation has not been examined. In a series of crosses between strains that differ radically in the amounts of 7-tricosene and 7-pentacosene, we have identified both X-linked and autosomal contributions to interstrain variation in the amounts of these compounds. The X-linked loci act as enhancers for production of the compound predominant in the strain from which the X chromosome originated. Autosomal factors for each of the two compounds appear to segregate as high vs. low, with incomplete dominance of high 7-tricosene over low, and low 7-pentacosene over high. A significant negative correlation between the quantities of 7-pentacosene and 7-tricosene in the F2 and backcross progeny, but not in the F1s or parentals, indicates linkage between autosomal loci regulating the expression of each compound. However, the phenotypic distributions of the backcross progeny indicate that additional unlinked loci are also directly involved in the production of these two hydrocarbons.",1988,"D Scott, R C Richmond, D Scott, R C Richmond"
A Fly's Eye View of Natural and Drug Reward,29720947,10.3389/fphys.2018.00407,"Animals encounter multiple stimuli each day. Some of these stimuli are innately appetitive or aversive, while others are assigned valence based on experience. Drugs like ethanol can elicit aversion in the short term and attraction in the long term. The reward system encodes the predictive value for different stimuli, mediating anticipation for attractive or punishing stimuli and driving animal behavior to approach or avoid conditioned stimuli. The neurochemistry and neurocircuitry of the reward system is partly evolutionarily conserved. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, including Drosophila melanogaster, dopamine is at the center of a network of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators acting in concert to encode rewards. Behavioral assays in D. melanogaster have become increasingly sophisticated, allowing more direct comparison with mammalian research. Moreover, recent evidence has established the functional modularity of the reward neural circuits in Drosophila. This functional modularity resembles the organization of reward circuits in mammals. The powerful genetic and molecular tools for D. melanogaster allow characterization and manipulation at the single-cell level. These tools are being used to construct a detailed map of the neural circuits mediating specific rewarding stimuli and have allowed for the identification of multiple genes and molecular pathways that mediate the effects of reinforcing stimuli, including their rewarding effects. This report provides an overview of the research on natural and drug reward in D. melanogaster, including natural rewards such as sugar and other food nutrients, and drug rewards including ethanol, cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, and nicotine. We focused mainly on the known genetic and neural mechanisms underlying appetitive reward for sugar and reward for ethanol. We also include genes, molecular pathways, and neural circuits that have been identified using assays that test the palatability of the rewarding stimulus, the preference for the rewarding stimulus, or other effects of the stimulus that indicate how it can modify behavior. Commonalities between mechanisms of natural and drug reward are highlighted and future directions are presented, putting forward questions best suited for research using D. melanogaster as a model organism.",2018,"Eve G Lowenstein, Norma A Velazquez-Ulloa, Eve G Lowenstein, Norma A Velazquez-Ulloa"

Using electrophysiological and calcium imaging assays, this research examined the response of Drosophila melanogaster olfactory receptors (ORs) to odor compounds significant in forensic science and assessed their potential utility as volatile compound sensors. This investigation illustrated the different sensitivities, selectivities, and sensing features of individual ORs and demonstrated that their employment for detection purposes is feasible.

Little is known about the physical properties of germ granules and how these relate to germ cell function. Here we study two types of germ granules in the Drosophila embryo: cytoplasmic germ granules that instruct primordial germ cells (PGCs) formation and nuclear germ granules within early PGCs with unknown function. We show that cytoplasmic and nuclear germ granules are phase transitioned condensates nucleated by Oskar protein that display liquid as well as hydrogel-like properties. Focusing on nuclear granules, we find that Oskar drives their formation in heterologous cell systems. Multiple, independent Oskar protein domains synergize to promote granule phase separation. Deletion of Oskar's nuclear localization sequence specifically ablates nuclear granules in cell systems.

"Short-Term, Intermittent Fasting Induces Long-Lasting Gut Health and TOR-Independent Lifespan Extension",29779873,10.1016/j.cub.2018.04.015,"Intermittent fasting (IF) can improve function and health during aging in laboratory model organisms, but the mechanisms at work await elucidation. We subjected fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to varying degrees of IF and found that just one month of a 2-day fed:5-day fasted IF regime at the beginning of adulthood was sufficient to extend lifespan. This long-lasting, beneficial effect of early IF was not due to reduced fecundity. Starvation resistance and resistance to oxidative and xenobiotic stress were increased after IF. Early-life IF also led to higher lipid content in 60-day-old flies, a potential explanation for increased longevity. Guts of flies 40 days post-IF showed a significant reduction in age-related pathologies and improved gut barrier function. Improved gut health was also associated with reduced relative bacterial abundance. Early IF thus induced profound long-term changes. Pharmacological and genetic epistasis analysis showed that IF acted independently of the TOR pathway because rapamycin and IF acted additively to extend lifespan, and global expression of a constitutively active S6K did not attenuate the IF-induced lifespan extension. We conclude that short-term IF during early life can induce long-lasting beneficial effects, with robust increase in lifespan in a TOR-independent manner, probably at least in part by preserving gut health.",2018,"James H Catterson, Mobina Khericha, Miranda C Dyson, Alec J Vincent, Rebecca Callard, Steven M Haveron, Arjunan Rajasingam, Mumtaz Ahmad, Linda Partridge, James H Catterson, Mobina Khericha, Miranda C Dyson, Alec J Vincent, Rebecca Callard, Steven M Haveron, Arjunan Rajasingam, Mumtaz Ahmad, Linda Partridge"

      Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) are involved in the biosynthesis of endogenous intracellular compounds and the metabolism of xenobiotics, including chemical insecticides. We investigated the structural and expression level variance across all P450 genes with respect to the evolution of insecticide resistance under multigenerational dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) selection.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) indicated that the transcript levels of seven P450 genes were significantly up-regulated and three P450 genes were down-regulated in the DDT-resistant strain 91-R, as compared to the control strain 91-C. The overexpression of Cyp6g1 was associated with the presence of an Accord and an HMS-Beagle element insertion in the 5' upstream region in conjunction with copy number variation in the 91-R strain, but not in the 91-C strain. A total of 122 (50.2%) fixed nonsynonymous (amino acid-changing) mutations were found between 91-C and 91-R, and 20 (8.2%) resulted in amino acid changes within functional domains.

Protective effect of (-)-Î±-bisabolol on rotenone-induced toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster,28881148,10.1139/cjpp-2017-0207,"(-)-Î±-Bisabolol (BISA) is a sesquiterpene alcohol, which has several recognized biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-irritant, and antibacterial properties. In the present study, we investigated the influence of BISA (5, 25, and 250 Î¼mol/L) on rotenone (500 Î¼mol/L)-induced toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster for 7 days. BISA supplementation significantly decreased rotenone-induced mortality and locomotor deficits. The loss of motor function induced by rotenone correlated with a significant change in stress response factors; it decreased thiol levels, inhibited mitochondria complex I, and increased the mRNA expression of antioxidant marker proteins such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and the keap1 gene product. Taken together, our findings indicate that the toxicity of rotenone is likely due to the direct inhibition of complex I activity, resulting in a high level of oxidative stress. Dietary supplementation with BISA affected the expression of SOD mRNA only at a concentration of 250 Î¼mol/L, and did not affect any other parameter measured. Our results showed a protective effect of BISA on rotenone-induced mortality and locomotor deficits in Drosophila; this effect did not correlate with mitochondrial complex I activity, but may be related to the antioxidant protection afforded by eliminating superoxide generated as a result of rotenone-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.",2018,"GerlÃ¢nia de Oliveira Leite, Assis Ecker, Rodrigo Lopes Seeger, BÃ¡rbara Nunes Krum, Thiago Henrique Lugokenski, Roselei Fachinetto, JÃ©ssie Haigert Sudati, Nilda Vargas Barbosa, Caroline Wagner, GerlÃ¢nia de Oliveira Leite, Assis Ecker, Rodrigo Lopes Seeger, BÃ¡rbara Nunes Krum, Thiago Henrique Lugokenski, Roselei Fachinetto, JÃ©ssie Haigert Sudati, Nilda Vargas Barbosa, Caroline Wagner"

Additionally, the spatial distribution of Hbs, Kirre, and Rst proteins indicates that they perform cooperative, although largely nonredundant, functions. Finally, phenotypical characterization of three different female sterile rst alleles uncovered two temporally separated and functionally distinct requirements for this locus in ovarian development: one in pupa, essential for the organization of peritoneal and epithelial sheaths that maintain the structural integrity of the adult organ and another, in mature ovarioles, needed for the progression of oogenesis beyond stage 10.",2018,"Felipe Berti Valer, Maiaro Cabral Rosa Machado, Rui Milton PatrÃ­cio Silva-Junior, Ricardo Guelerman Pinheiro Ramos, Felipe Berti Valer, Maiaro Cabral Rosa Machado, Rui Milton PatrÃ­cio Silva-Junior, Ricardo Guelerman Pinheiro Ramos"
Enhancing Ebony?

The Australian populations exhibited strong association with the core enhancer polymorphism cluster in complete association with Dark and Light phenotypes from Iriomote, Japan. Moreover, the Iriomote Light and Dark core enhancer haplotypes are common to the Australian populations in the direction predicted by pigmentation phenotype. We also confirmed the Japanese patterns of linkage disequilibrium and association of the tropical inversion In(3R)Payne with the Light enhancer haplotype in the Australian tropical light population. A worldwide survey of the ??.5-kb ebony control region SNPs and haplotypes in a subset of the Drosophila Genome Nexus (DGN) populations suggest origins in the sub-Saharan ancestral region surrounding Zambia and subsequent invasion following colonization out of Africa. A previous study demonstrated complex within and between population genetic architecture for abdominal pigmentation which is also correlated with thoracic pigmentation in melanized DGN sub-Saharan populations; however, the ??.5-kb ebony control region was not associated and both haplotypes are common even in the most intensely pigmented D. melanogaster from high altitude Ethiopia. In the Australian populations, the strong phenotypic association with the enhancer SNPs and haplotypes that at least partly regulates ebony expression in the Iriomote population, our previous work demonstrating opposing clines for thoracic pigmentation and ebony expression, where the expression cline parallels the In(3R)Payne cline, and the concerted evolution of pigmentation intensity and ebony expression under rapid experimental evolution, all point to a common adaptive evolutionary pathway in distinct populations.",2018,"Marina Telonis-Scott, Ary A Hoffmann, Marina Telonis-Scott, Ary A Hoffmann"

Disruptions in mitophagy have been observed in parkin loss-of-function models, and changes in mitochondrial respiration have been reported in patient fibroblasts. Whether loss of parkin causes selective DA neurodegeneration in vivo as a result of lost or decreased mitophagy is unknown. This study employs the use of fluorescent constructs expressed in Drosophila DA neurons that are functionally homologous to those of the mammalian substantia nigra. We provide evidence that degenerating DA neurons in parkin loss-of-function mutant flies have advanced mitochondrial aging, and that mitochondrial networks are fragmented and contain swollen organelles. We also found that mitophagy initiation is decreased in park (Drosophila parkin/PARK2 ortholog) homozygous mutants, but autophagosome formation is unaffected, and mitochondrial network volumes are decreased. As the fly ages, autophagosome recruitment becomes similar to control, while mitochondria continue to show signs of damage, and climbing deficits persist. Interestingly, aberrant mitochondrial morphology, aging and mitophagy initiation were not observed in DA neurons that do not degenerate.

Naltrexone Reverses Ethanol Preference and Protein Kinase C Activation in Drosophila melanogaster,29593550,10.3389/fphys.2018.00175,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major health, social and economic problem for which there are few effective treatments. The opiate antagonist naltrexone is currently prescribed clinically with mixed success. We have used naltrexone in an established behavioral assay (CAFE) in Drosophila melanogaster that measures the flies' preference for ethanol-containing food. We have confirmed that Drosophila exposed to ethanol develop a preference toward this drug and we demonstrate that naltrexone, in a dose dependant manner, reverses the ethanol-induced ethanol preference. This effect is not permanent, as preference for alcohol returns after discontinuing naltrexone. Additionally, naltrexone reduced the alcohol-induced increase in protein kinase C activity. These findings are of interest because they confirm that Drosophila is a useful model for studying human responses to addictive drugs. Additionally because of the lack of a closely conserved opiate system in insects, our results could either indicate that a functionally related system does exist in insects or that in insects, and potentially also in mammals, naltrexone binds to alternative sites. Identifying such sites could lead to improved treatment strategies for AUD.",2018,"Rajeswari Koyyada, Nilesh Latchooman, Julius Jonaitis, Samir S Ayoub, Olivia Corcoran, Stefano O Casalotti, Rajeswari Koyyada, Nilesh Latchooman, Julius Jonaitis, Samir S Ayoub, Olivia Corcoran, Stefano O Casalotti"
A species-specific multigene family mediates differential sperm displacement in Drosophila melanogaster,29315521,10.1111/evo.13417,"Sperm competition is a postcopulatory sexual selection mechanism in species in which females mate with multiple males. Despite its evolutionary relevance in shaping male traits, the genetic mechanisms underlying sperm competition are poorly understood. A recently originated multigene family specific to Drosophila melanogaster, Sdic, is important for the outcome of sperm competition in doubly mated females, although the mechanistic nature of this phenotype remained unresolved. Here, we compared doubly mated females, second mated to either Sdic knockout or nonknockout males, and directly visualize sperm dynamics in the female reproductive tract. We found that a less effective removal of first-to-mate male's sperm within the female's sperm storage organs is consistent with a reduced sperm competitive ability of the Sdic knockout males. Our results highlight the role young genes can play in driving the evolution of sperm competition.",2018,"Vivek Jayaswal, Jamie Jimenez, Robert Magie, Kien Nguyen, Bryan Clifton, Shudan Yeh, JosÃ© M Ranz, Vivek Jayaswal, Jamie Jimenez, Robert Magie, Kien Nguyen, Bryan Clifton, Shudan Yeh, JosÃ© M Ranz"

A New Portrait of Constitutive Heterochromatin: Lessons from Drosophila melanogaster,31320181,10.1016/j.tig.2019.06.002,"Constitutive heterochromatin represents a significant portion of eukaryotic genomes, but its functions still need to be elucidated. Even in the most updated genetics and molecular biology textbooks, constitutive heterochromatin is portrayed mainly as the 'silent' component of eukaryotic genomes. However, there may be more complexity to the relationship between heterochromatin and gene expression. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a model for heterochromatin studies, about one-third of the genome is heterochromatic and is concentrated in the centric, pericentric, and telomeric regions of the chromosomes. Recent findings indicate that hundreds of D. melanogaster genes can 'live and work' properly within constitutive heterochromatin. The genomic size of these genes is generally larger than that of euchromatic genes and together they account for a significant fraction of the entire constitutive heterochromatin. Thus, this peculiar genome component in spite its ability to induce silencing, has in fact the means for being quite dynamic. A major scope of this review is to revisit the 'dogma of silent heterochromatin'.",2019,"RenÃ© M Marsano, Ennio Giordano, Giovanni Messina, Patrizio Dimitri, RenÃ© M Marsano, Ennio Giordano, Giovanni Messina, Patrizio Dimitri"
Traumatic injury in female Drosophila melanogaster affects the development and induces behavioral abnormalities in the offspring,31653253,10.1186/s12993-019-0163-1,"Traumatic injury (TI) during pregnancy increases the risk for developing neurological disorders in the infants. These disorders are a major concern for the well-being of children born after TI during pregnancy. TI during pregnancy may result in preterm labor and delivery, abruptio placentae, and/or fetomaternal hemorrhage. Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) is a widely used model to study brain and behavioral disorders in humans. In this study, we analyzed the effects of TI to female fruit flies on the development timing of larvae, social interaction and the behavior of offspring flies. TI to the female flies was found to affect the development of larvae and the behavior of offspring flies. There was a significant increase in the length of larvae delivered by traumatically injured maternal flies as compared to larvae from control maternal flies (without TI). The pupae formation from larvae, and the metamorphosis of pupae to the first generation of flies were faster in the TI group than the control group. Negative geotaxis and distance of the fly to its nearest neighbor are parameters of behavioral assessment in fruit flies. Negative geotaxis significantly decreased in the first generation of both male (p = 0.0021) and female (p = 0.0426) flies. The distance between the first generation of flies to its nearest neighbor was shorter in both male and female offspring flies in the TI group as compared to control group flies. These results indicate that TI to the female flies affected the development of larvae and resulted in early delivery, impaired social interaction and behavioral alterations in the offspring.",2019,"Ved Chauhan, Abha Chauhan, Ved Chauhan, Abha Chauhan"
Alkaline Ceramidase Mediates the Oxidative Stress Response in Drosophila melanogaster Through Sphingosine,31115476,10.1093/jisesa/iez042,"Alkaline ceramidase (Dacer) in Drosophila melanogaster was demonstrated to be resistant to paraquat-induced oxidative stress. However, the underlying mechanism for this resistance remained unclear. Here, we showed that sphingosine feeding triggered the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Dacer-deficient D. melanogaster (Dacer mutant) has higher catalase (CAT) activity and CAT transcription level, leading to higher resistance to oxidative stress induced by paraquat. By performing a quantitative proteomic analysis, we identified 79 differentially expressed proteins in comparing Dacer mutant to wild type. Three oxidoreductases, including two cytochrome P450 (CG3050, CG9438) and an oxoglutarate/iron-dependent dioxygenase (CG17807), were most significantly upregulated in Dacer mutant.

A single male auditory response test to quantify auditory behavioral responses in Drosophila melanogaster,31106644,10.1080/01677063.2019.1611805,"Many animals utilize auditory signals to communicate with conspecific individuals. During courtship, males of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and related species produce a courtship song comprised of sine and pulse songs by vibrating their wings. The pulse song increases female receptivity and male courtship activity, indicating that it functions as a sexual signal. One song parameter, interpulse interval (IPI), varies among closely related species. In D. melanogaster, a song with a conspecific IPI induces a stronger behavioral response than heterospecific songs, indicating the ability of the flies to discriminate conspecific IPI. Traditionally, the fly's response to the song is measured under grouped conditions, in which the effect of sensory modalities other than audition cannot be excluded. Here, to quantify the individual ability to discriminate a conspecific song, we systematically analyzed the auditory response of single male flies to sound with various parameters. Moreover, we applied this method, termed SMART (Single Male Auditory Response Test), to two sister species for potential application in a comparative approach. By quantifying the locomotor activity of single D. melanogaster males during sound exposure, we detected increased locomotor activity in response to pulse songs, but not to white noise or pure tone. The conspecific song evoked stronger response than the heterospecific songs, and ablation of their antennal receivers severely suppressed the locomotor increase. A pulse song with a small IPI variation evoked a continuous response, while the response to songs with highly variable IPIs tends to be rapidly decayed. This provides the first evidence that fruit flies discriminate IPI variations, which possibly inform the age and social contexts of the singer. Sister species, D. sechellia, exhibited a locomotor response to pulse song, while D. simulans exhibited no behavioral response. This suggests that auditory and other stimuli that elicit this behavioral response are diversified among Drosophila species.",2019,"Yuki Ishikawa, Natsuki Okamoto, Yusuke Yoneyama, Naoki Maeda, Azusa Kamikouchi, Yuki Ishikawa, Natsuki Okamoto, Yusuke Yoneyama, Naoki Maeda, Azusa Kamikouchi"

We mapped the developmental origin of four key CX subtypes and found that neurons with similar origin have similar axon/dendrite targeting. Moreover, we found that the temporal transcription factor (TTF) Eyeless/Pax6 regulates the development of two recurrently-connected CX subtypes: Eyeless loss simultaneously produces ectopic P-EN neurons with normal axon/dendrite projections, and reduces the number of E-PG neurons. Furthermore, transient loss of Eyeless during development impairs adult flies' capacity to perform celestial navigation. We conclude that neurons with similar developmental origin have similar connectivity, that Eyeless maintains equal E-PG and P-EN neuron number, and that Eyeless is required for the development of circuits that control adult navigation.",2019,"Luis F Sullivan, Timothy L Warren, Chris Q Doe, Luis F Sullivan, Timothy L Warren, Chris Q Doe"

The most prevalent mechanism, cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), traces to a Wolbachia deubiquitylase, CidB, and CidA. CidB has properties of a toxin, while CidA binds CidB and rescues embryonic viability. CidB is also toxic to yeast where we identified both host effects and high-copy suppressors of toxicity. The strongest suppressor was karyopherin-Î±, a nuclear-import receptor; this required nuclear localization-signal binding. A protein-interaction screen of Drosophila extracts using a substrate-trapping catalytic mutant, CidB*, also identified karyopherin-Î±; the P32 protamine-histone exchange factor bound as well. When CidB* bound CidA, these host protein interactions disappeared. These associations would place CidB at the zygotic male pronucleus where CI defects first manifest. Overexpression of karyopherin-Î±, P32, or CidA in female flies suppressed CI. We propose that CidB targets nuclear-protein import and protamine-histone exchange and that CidA rescues embryos by restricting CidB access to its targets.",2019,"John Frederick Beckmann, Gagan Deep Sharma, Luis Mendez, Hongli Chen, Mark Hochstrasser, John Frederick Beckmann, Gagan Deep Sharma, Luis Mendez, Hongli Chen, Mark Hochstrasser"

Action-based attention in Drosophila melanogaster,31042449,10.1152/jn.00164.2019,"The mechanism of action selection is a widely shared fundamental process required by animals to interact with the environment and adapt to it. A key step in this process is the filtering of the ""distracting"" sensory inputs that may disturb action selection. Because it has been suggested that, in principle, action selection may also be processed by shared circuits in vertebrate and invertebrates, we wondered whether invertebrates show the ability to filter out ""distracting"" stimuli during a goal-directed action, as seen in vertebrates. In this experiment, action selection was studied in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster by investigating their reaction to the abrupt appearance of a visual distractor during an ongoing locomotor action directed to a visual target. We found that when the distractor was present, flies tended to shift the original trajectory toward it, thus acknowledging its presence, but they did not fully commit to it, suggesting that an inhibition process took place to continue the unfolding of the planned goal-directed action. To some extent flies appeared to take into account and represent motorically the distractor, but they did not engage in a complete change of their initial motor program in favor of the distractor. These results provide interesting insights into the selection-for-action mechanism, in a context requiring action-centered attention, that might have appeared rather early in the course of evolution. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Action selection and maintenance of a goal-directed action require animals to ignore irrelevant ""distracting"" stimuli that might elicit alternative motor programs. In this study we observed, in Drosophila melanogaster, a top-down mechanism inhibiting the response toward salient stimuli, to accomplish a goal-directed action.

Genetic and Molecular Analysis of Essential Genes in Centromeric Heterochromatin of the Left Arm of Chromosome 3 in Drosophila melanogaster,30948422,10.1534/g3.119.0003,"A large portion of the Drosophila melanogaster genome is contained within heterochromatic regions of chromosomes, predominantly at centromeres and telomeres.

However, it has been difficult to derive similar data for sequences within centromeric (centric) heterochromatin because these regions have not been as amenable to analysis by standard genetic and molecular tools. Here we present an updated genetic and molecular analysis of chromosome 3L centric heterochromatin (3L Het). We have generated and characterized a number of new, overlapping deficiencies (Dfs) which remove regions of 3L Het. These Dfs were critically important reagents in our subsequent genetic analysis for the isolation and characterization of lethal point mutations in the region. The assignment of these mutations to genetically-defined essential loci was followed by matching them to gene models derived from genome sequence data: this was done by using molecular mapping plus sequence analysis of mutant alleles, thereby aligning genetic and physical maps of the region. We also identified putative essential gene sequences in 3L Het by using RNA interference to target candidate gene sequences. We report that at least 25, or just under 2/3 of loci in 3L Het, are essential for viability and/or fertility.

Flying Drosophila show sex-specific attraction to fly-labelled food,31628403,10.1038/s41598-019-51351-1,"Animals searching for food and sexual partners often use odourant mixtures combining food-derived molecules and pheromones.

To evaluate the effects of these chemicals on odour-tracking behaviour, we tested Drosophila individuals in a wind tunnel. Upwind flight and food preference were measured in individual control males and females presented with a choice of two food sources labelled by fly lines producing varying amounts of CHs and/or cVA.

Fully automated leg tracking of Drosophila neurodegeneration models reveals distinct conserved movement signatures,31246996,10.1371/journal.pbio.3000346,"Some neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinsons Disease (PD) and Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3), are associated with distinct, altered gait and tremor movements that are reflective of the underlying disease etiology. Drosophila melanogaster models of neurodegeneration have illuminated our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease. However, it is unknown whether specific gait and tremor dysfunctions also occur in fly disease mutants. To answer this question, we developed a machine-learning image-analysis program, Feature Learning-based LImb segmentation and Tracking (FLLIT), that automatically tracks leg claw positions of freely moving flies recorded on high-speed video, producing a series of gait measurements. Notably, unlike other machine-learning methods, FLLIT generates its own training sets and does not require user-annotated images for learning. Using FLLIT, we carried out high-throughput and high-resolution analysis of gait and tremor features in Drosophila neurodegeneration mutants for the first time. We found that fly models of PD and SCA3 exhibited markedly different walking gait and tremor signatures, which recapitulated characteristics of the respective human diseases. Selective expression of mutant SCA3 in dopaminergic neurons led to a gait signature that more closely resembled those of PD flies. This suggests that the behavioral phenotype depends on the neurons affected rather than the specific nature of the mutation.

In Vivo Optical Calcium Imaging of Learning-Induced Synaptic Plasticity in Drosophila melanogaster,31657798,10.3791/60288,"Decades of research in many model organisms have led to the current concept of synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory formation. Learning-induced changes in synaptic transmission are often distributed across many neurons and levels of processing in the brain. Therefore, methods to visualize learning-dependent synaptic plasticity across neurons are needed. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represents a particularly favorable model organism to study neuronal circuits underlying learning. The protocol presented here demonstrates a way in which the processes underlying the formation of associative olfactory memories, i.e., synaptic activity and their changes, can be monitored in vivo. Using the broad array of genetic tools available in Drosophila, it is possible to specifically express genetically encoded calcium indicators in determined cell populations and even single cells. By fixing a fly in place, and opening the head capsule, it is possible to visualize calcium dynamics in these cells whilst delivering olfactory stimuli. Additionally, we demonstrate a set-up in which the fly can be subjected, simultaneously, to electric shocks to the body. This provides a system in which flies can undergo classical olfactory conditioning - whereby a previously naÃ¯ve odor is learned to be associated with electric shock punishment - at the same time as the representation of this odor (and other untrained odors) is observed in the brain via two-photon microscopy. Our lab has previously reported the generation of synaptically localized calcium sensors, which enables one to confine the fluorescent calcium signals to pre- or postsynaptic compartments. Two-photon microscopy provides a way to spatially resolve fine structures. We exemplify this by focusing on neurons integrating information from the mushroom body, a higher-order center of the insect brain. Overall, this protocol provides a method to examine the synaptic connections between neurons whose activity is modulated as a result of olfactory learning.",2019,"Clare E Hancock, Florian Bilz, AndrÃ© Fiala, Clare E Hancock, Florian Bilz, AndrÃ© Fiala"

Herein, the longevity effect of KRG was investigated in Drosophila melanogaster by feeding KRG extracts, and the molecular mechanism of lifespan extension was elucidated by using longevity-related mutant flies. KRG extended the lifespan of Drosophila when administrated at 10 and 25 Î¼g/mL, and the longevity benefit of KRG was not due to reduced feeding, reproduction, and/or climbing ability in fruit flies, indicating that the longevity benefit of KRG is a direct effect of KRG, not of a secondary artifact. Diet supplementation with KRG increased the lifespan of flies on a full-fed diet but not of those on a restricted diet, and the longevity effect of KRG was diminished by the mutation of dSir2, a deacetylase known to mediate the benefits of dietary restriction. Similarly, the longevity effect of KRG was mediated by the reduction of insulin/IGF-1 signaling.

An RBPJ- Drosophila Model Reveals Dependence of RBPJ Protein Stability on the Formation of Transcription-Regulator Complexes,31615108,10.3390/cells8101252,"Notch signaling activity governs widespread cellular differentiation in higher animals, including humans, and is involved in several congenital diseases and different forms of cancer. Notch signals are mediated by the transcriptional regulator RBPJ in a complex with activated Notch (NICD). Analysis of Notch pathway regulation in humans is hampered by a partial redundancy of the four Notch receptor copies, yet RBPJ is solitary, allowing its study in model systems. In Drosophila melanogaster, the RBPJ orthologue is encoded by Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)]. Using genome engineering, we replaced Su(H) by murine RBPJ in order to study its function in the fly. In fact, RBPJ largely substitutes for Su(H)'s function, yet subtle phenotypes reflect increased Notch signaling activity. Accordingly, the binding of RBPJ to Hairless (H) protein, the general Notch antagonist in Drosophila, was considerably reduced compared to that of Su(H). An H-binding defective RBPJLLL mutant matched the respective Su(H)LLL allele: homozygotes were lethal due to extensive Notch hyperactivity. Moreover, RBPJLLL protein accumulated at lower levels than wild type RBPJ, except in the presence of NICD. Apparently, RBPJ protein stability depends on protein complex formation with either H or NICD, similar to Su(H), demonstrating that the murine homologue underlies the same regulatory mechanisms as Su(H) in Drosophila.

Testis single-cell RNA-seq reveals the dynamics of de novo gene transcription and germline mutational bias in Drosophila,31418408,10.7554/eLife.47138,"The testis is a peculiar tissue in many respects. It shows patterns of rapid gene evolution and provides a hotspot for the origination of genetic novelties such as de novo genes, duplications and mutations. To investigate the expression patterns of genetic novelties across cell types, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of adult Drosophila testis. We found that new genes were expressed in various cell types, the patterns of which may be influenced by their mode of origination. In particular, lineage-specific de novo genes are commonly expressed in early spermatocytes, while young duplicated genes are often bimodally expressed. Analysis of germline substitutions suggests that spermatogenesis is a highly reparative process, with the mutational load of germ cells decreasing as spermatogenesis progresses. By elucidating the distribution of genetic novelties across spermatogenesis, this study provides a deeper understanding of how the testis maintains its core reproductive function while being a hotbed of evolutionary innovation.",2019,"Evan Witt, Sigi Benjamin, Nicolas Svetec, Li Zhao, Evan Witt, Sigi Benjamin, Nicolas Svetec, Li Zhao"
A combined computational strategy of sequence and structural analysis predicts the existence of a functional eicosanoid pathway in Drosophila melanogaster,30753230,10.1371/journal.pone.0211897,"This study reports on a putative eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway in Drosophila melanogaster and challenges the currently held view that mechanistic routes to synthesize eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipids do not exist in insects, since to date, putative fly homologs of most mammalian enzymes have not been identified. Here we use systematic and comprehensive bioinformatics approaches to identify most of the mammalian eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. Sensitive sequence analysis techniques identified candidate Drosophila enzymes that share low global sequence identities with their human counterparts. Twenty Drosophila candidates were selected based upon (a) sequence identity with human enzymes of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase branches, (b) similar domain architecture and structural conservation of the catalytic domain, and (c) presence of potentially equivalent functional residues. Evaluation of full-length structural models for these 20 top-scoring Drosophila candidates revealed a surprising degree of conservation in their overall folds and potential analogs for functional residues in all 20 enzymes. Although we were unable to identify any suitable candidate for lipoxygenase enzymes, we report structural homology models of three fly cyclooxygenases. Our findings predict that the D. melanogaster genome likely codes for one or more pathways for eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipid synthesis. Our study suggests that classical and/or novel eicosanoids mediators must regulate biological functions in insects-predictions that can be tested with the power of Drosophila genetics. Such experimental analysis of eicosanoid biology in a simple model organism will have high relevance to human development and health.",2019,"Michael Scarpati, Yan Qi, Shubha Govind, Shaneen Singh, Michael Scarpati, Yan Qi, Shubha Govind, Shaneen Singh"
Short-Term Memory Deficits in the SLEEP Inbred Panel,32596662,10.3390/clockssleep1040036,"Although sleep is heritable and conserved across species, sleep duration varies from individual to individual. A shared genetic architecture between sleep duration and other evolutionarily important traits could explain this variability. Learning and memory are critical traits sharing a genetic architecture with sleep. We wanted to know whether learning and memory would be altered in extreme long or short sleepers. We therefore assessed the short-term learning and memory ability of flies from the Sleep Inbred Panel (SIP), a collection of 39 extreme long- and short-sleeping inbred lines of Drosophila. Neither long nor short sleepers had appreciable learning, in contrast to a moderate-sleeping control. We also examined the response of long and short sleepers to enriched social conditions, a paradigm previously shown to induce morphological changes in the brain. While moderate-sleeping control flies had increased daytime sleep and quantifiable increases in brain structures under enriched social conditions, flies of the Sleep Inbred Panel did not display these changes. The SIP thus emerges as an important model for the relationship between sleep and learning and memory.",2019,"Shailesh Kumar, Kirklin R Smith, Yazmin L Serrano Negron, Susan T Harbison, Shailesh Kumar, Kirklin R Smith, Yazmin L Serrano Negron, Susan T Harbison"
GC-MS Chemical Characterization and In Vitro Evaluation of Antioxidant and Toxic Effects Using Drosophila melanogaster Model of the Essential Oil of Lantana montevidensis (Spreng) Briq,31126036,10.3390/medicina55050194,"Background and objectives: Natural products such as essential oils with antioxidant potential can reduce the level of oxidative stress and prevent the oxidation of biomolecules. In the present study, we investigated the antioxidant potential of Lantana montevidensis leaf essential oil (EOLM) in chemical and biological models using Drosophila melanogaster. Materials and methods: in addition, the chemical components of the oil were identified and quantified by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the percentage compositions were obtained from electronic integration measurements using flame ionization detection (FID). Results: our results demonstrated that EOLM is rich in terpenes with Germacrene-D (31.27%) and Î²-caryophyllene (28.15%) as the major components. EOLM (0.12-0.48 g/mL) was ineffective in scavenging DPPH radical, and chelating Fe(II), but showed reducing activity at 0.24 g/mL and 0.48 g/mL. In in vivo studies, exposure of D. melanogaster to EOLM (0.12-0.48 g/mL) for 5 h resulted in 10% mortality; no change in oxidative stress parameters such as total thiol, non-protein thiol, and malondialdehyde contents, in comparison to control (p > 0.05).

Different Evolutionary Trajectories of Two Insect-Specific Paralogous Proteins Involved in Stabilizing Muscle Myofibrils,31123042,10.1534/genetics.119.302217,"Alp/Enigma family members have a unique PDZ domain followed by zero to four LIM domains, and are essential for myofibril assembly across all species analyzed so far. Drosophila melanogaster has three Alp/Enigma family members, Zasp52, Zasp66, and Zasp67. Ortholog search and phylogenetic tree analysis suggest that Zasp genes have a common ancestor, and that Zasp66 and Zasp67 arose by duplication in insects. While Zasp66 has a conserved domain structure across orthologs, Zasp67 domains and lengths are highly variable. In flies, Zasp67 appears to be expressed only in indirect flight muscles, where it colocalizes with Zasp52 at Z-discs. We generated a CRISPR null mutant of Zasp67, which is viable but flightless. We can rescue all phenotypes by re-expressing a Zasp67 transgene at endogenous levels. Zasp67 mutants show extended and broken Z-discs in adult flies, indicating that the protein helps stabilize the highly regular myofibrils of indirect flight muscles. In contrast, a Zasp66 CRISPR null mutant has limited viability, but only mild indirect flight muscle defects illustrating the diverging evolutionary paths these two paralogous genes have taken since they arose by duplication.",2019,"Nicanor GonzÃ¡lez-Morales, Thomas W Marsh, Anja Katzemich, OcÃ©ane Marescal, Yu Shu Xiao, Frieder SchÃ¶ck, Nicanor GonzÃ¡lez-Morales, Thomas W Marsh, Anja Katzemich, OcÃ©ane Marescal, Yu Shu Xiao, Frieder SchÃ¶ck"

[A Study of the Fertility of a Drosophila melanogaster MS Strain with Impaired Transposition Control of the gypsy Mobile Element],32492004,10.31857/S002689842003009X,"The flamenco locus is one of the main components of the piRNA pathway of regulation of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations at this locus lead to an increase in the transposition activity of MGEs and, as a result, to genetic instability. In this paper, the fertility of a genetically unstable MS strain obtained more than 25 years ago and characterized by a mutation in the flamenco locus and the presence of a functionally active copy of gypsy retrotransposon was investigated. Complex violations of the ovarian morphology were revealed in the MS strain in females: defects in the follicular layer and ring channels, as well as degradation of trophocytes, which in turn led to a decrease in reproductive abilities. Analysis of the MS strain transcriptome showed a decrease in the expression level of 40 genes encoding chorionic proteins and expression specificity at different stages of follicle development. In the F1 and F2 hybrid females from the crosses of MS females with wild type males, restoration of reproductive abilities was observed, despite the fact that half of the F2 females had the flamenco genotype and genetic instability caused by transposition of gypsy (according to the ovo^(D) test). Moreover, the frequency of gypsy transposition in the hybrid F2 females with the flamenco genotype doubled in comparison with the MS strain females. Thus, the MS strain had acquired partial suppression of the flamenco phenotype and accumulated several recessive mutations in the genes that control oogenesis after cultivation for over 25 years.",2020,"I V Kukushkina, P A Makhnovskii, L N Nefedova, E A Balakireva, N I Romanova, I V Kuzmin, A R Lavrenov, A I Kim, I V Kukushkina, P A Makhnovskii, L N Nefedova, E A Balakireva, N I Romanova, I V Kuzmin, A R Lavrenov, A I Kim"
Role of nuclear-cytoplasmic protein localization during Drosophila neuroblast development,32526151,10.1139/gen-2020-0039,"Nuclear-cytoplasmic localization is an efficient way to regulate transcription factors and chromatin remodelers. Altering the location of existing protein pools also facilitates a more rapid response to changes in cell activity or extracellular signals. There are several examples of proteins that are regulated by nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, which are required for Drosophila neuroblast development. Disruption of the localization of homologs of these proteins has also been linked to several neurodegenerative disorders in humans. Drosophila has been used extensively to model the neurodegenerative disorders caused by aberrant nucleo-cytoplasmic localization. Here, we focus on the role of alternative nucleo-cytoplasmic protein localization in regulating proliferation and cell fate decisions in the Drosophila neuroblast and in neurodegenerative disorders.

Acute exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of RCP (15 Î¼g/mL) and POEA (45 Î¼g/mL) reduced (p < 0.001) lifespan of female flies compared to untreated controls or glyphosate (100 Î¼g/mL). Negative geotaxis responses in female flies were reduced (p < 0.05) following acute exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of RCP and POEA whereas glyphosate did not significantly affect this response compared to untreated flies. Acute exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of RCP and POEA elevated (p < 0.05) protein carbonyl levels while markedly (p < 0.01) inhibiting carbonyl reductase activity whereas glyphosate treatment did not significantly affect protein carbonyl levels or carbonyl reductase activity. Fecundity was reduced (p < 0.05) following exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of RCP and POEA whereas glyphosate did not affect fecundity. In vitro treatment of ovarian stem sheath (OSS) cells with sub-lethal concentrations of RCP and POEA revealed decreased cell viability and enhanced caspase activity indicative of pro-apoptotic processes after 48 h compared to untreated controls. Glyphosate however was non-toxic at the concentration used.

Two-Faced: Roles of JNK Signalling During Tumourigenesis in the Drosophila Model,32117973,10.3389/fcell.2020.00042,"The highly conserved c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signalling pathway has many functions, regulating a diversity of processes: from cell movement during embryogenesis to the stress response of cells after environmental insults. Studies modelling cancer using the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, have identified both pro- and anti-tumourigenic roles for JNK signalling, depending on context. As a tumour suppressor, JNK signalling commonly is activated by conserved Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) signalling, which promotes the caspase-mediated death of tumourigenic cells. JNK pathway activation can also occur via actin cytoskeleton alterations, and after cellular damage inflicted by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, JNK signalling frequently acts in concert with Salvador-Warts-Hippo (SWH) signalling - either upstream of or parallel to this potent growth-suppressing pathway. As a tumour promoter, JNK signalling is co-opted by cells expressing activated Ras-MAPK signalling (among other pathways), and used to drive cell morphological changes, induce invasive behaviours, block differentiation, and enable persistent cell proliferation. Furthermore, JNK is capable of non-autonomous influences within tumour microenvironments by effecting the transcription of various cell growth- and proliferation-promoting molecules. In this review, we discuss these aspects of JNK signalling in Drosophila tumourigenesis models, and highlight recent publications that have expanded our knowledge of this important and versatile pathway.",2020,"John E La Marca, Helena E Richardson, John E La Marca, Helena E Richardson"

Autonomous replication in Drosophila melanogaster tissue culture cells,7587582,10.1007/BF00357686,"This study addresses the ability of DNA fragments from various sources to mediate autonomous DNA replication in cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells. We created a series of plasmids containing genomic DNA fragments from the Ultrabithorax gene of Drosophila and test ed them for autonomous replication after transfection into Schneider line 2 cells. We found that all plasmids containing Drosophila DNA were able to replicate autonomously, as were random human and Escherichia coli genomic DNA fragments. Most of the plasmids were detectable 18 days after transfection in the absence of selection, suggesting that transfected DNA is maintained in Drosophila cells without rapid loss or degradation. The finding that all plasmids containing Drosophila, human or bacterial DNA replicate autonomously in Drosophila cells suggests that the signals that direct autonomous replication in Drosophila contain a low degree of sequence specificity. A two-dimensional gel analysis of initiation on one of the plasmids was consistent with many dispersed initiation sites. Low sequence specificity and dispersed initiation sites also characterize autonomous replication in human cells and Xenopus eggs and may be general properties of autonomous replication in animal cells.",1995,"J G Smith, M P Calos, J G Smith, M P Calos"

Natural populations of both species were sampled and tested for resistance to chlorpyrifos; the 2 more intensively sampled populations were D. melanogaster in commercial vineyards. One vineyard had been treated repeatedly with chlorpyrifos to control this secondary pest species; the other had never been treated with an organophosphorus compound. The LC50 to chlorpyrifos of a genetically heterogeneous line of D. melanogaster from the exposed population (Be'er Tuvia) was 99 ng/cm2, and the LC50 of a corresponding line from the unexposed population (Sde Eliahu) was 52 ng/cm2; the wild-caught lines were much more resistant than a laboratory strain, Canton-S, whose LC50 was 0.25 ng/cm2. Genetic variance for resistance existed in both natural populations but realized heritability did not differ significantly between the populations.

This cDNA encodes a deduced protein containing 2516 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 276,493. The deduced protein shares many features with vertebrate homologs, including four repeat structures, each containing six transmembrane domains, a conserved ion selectivity filter region between transmembrane domains 5 and 6, and an EF hand in the carboxy tail. The Drosophila subunit has unusually long initial amino and terminal carboxy tails. The region corresponding to the last transmembrane domain (IVS6) and the adjacent cytoplasmic domain has been postulated to form a phenylalkylamine-binding site in vertebrate calcium channels. This region is conserved in the Drosophila sequence, while domains thought to be involved in dihydropyridine binding show numerous changes. The Drosophila subunit exhibits 78.3% sequence similarity to the rat brain type D calcium channel alpha 1 subunit, and so has been designated as a Drosophila melanogaster calcium channel alpha 1 type D subunit (Dmca1D). In situ hybridization shows that Dmca1D is highly expressed in the embryonic nervous system. Northern analysis shows that Dmca1D cDNA hybridizes to three size classes of mRNA (9.5, 10.2, and 12.5 kb) in heads, but only two classes (9.5 and 12.5 kb) in bodies and legs.

"Biological basis of germline mutation: comparisons of spontaneous germline mutation rates among drosophila, mouse, and human",7789362,10.1002/em.2850250609,"Spontaneous mutation rates per generation are similar among the three species considered here--Drosophila, mouse, and human--and are not related to time, as is often assumed. Spontaneous germline mutation rates per generation averaged among loci are less variable among species than they are among loci and tests and between gender. Mutation rates are highly variable over time in diverse lineages. Recent estimates of the number of germ cell divisions per generation are: for humans, 401 (30-year generation) in males and 31 in females; for mice, 62 (9-month generation) in males and 25 in females; and for Drosophila melanogaster, 35.5 (18-day generation) in males and 36.5 (25-day generation) in females. The relationships between germ cell division estimates of the two sexes in the three species closely reflect those between mutation rates in the sexes, although mutation rates per cell division vary among species. Whereas the overall rate per generation is constant among species, this consistency must be achieved by diverse mechanisms. Modifiers of mutation rates, on which selection might act, include germline characteristics that contribute disproportionately to the total mutation rates. The germline mutation rates between the sexes within a species are largely influenced by germ cell divisions per generation. Also, a large portion of the total mutations occur during the interval between the beginning of meiosis and differentiation of the soma from the germline. Significant genetic events contributing to mutations during this time may include meiosis, lack of DNA repair in sperm cells, methylation of CpG dinucleotides in mammalian sperm and early embryo, gonomeric fertilization, and rapid cleavage divisions.",1995,"J B Drost, W R Lee, J B Drost, W R Lee"
Enhancer-trap detection of expression patterns corresponding to the polar coordinate system in the imaginal discs of Drosophila melanogaster,28305739,10.1007/BF00360483,"We have isolated three classes of ""enhancertrap"" lines of Drosophila in which lacZ expression patterns in the imaginal discs are consistent with the idea of a polar (radial and angular) coordinate system of positional information. In the first class (HZ76), a circular pattern was expressed transiently during the mid-third instar larval stage when the radial components of the coordinate are probably generated. The expression patterns of the second class (HZ84) were sector-shaped and circular in the leg disc, suggesting a correlation with both radial and angular coordinate values. The expression patterns found in the third class (PZ63 and PZ22) were circular and appeared to reflect radial positional values. Expression in the latter two classes always began in the presumptive dorsal region of the leg disc and gradually spread to the ventral region. These developmental profiles of expression suggested the existence of a centre that initiates patterned gene expression in the presumptive dorsal region of the leg disc. The PZ22 line showed transient expression during tarsal segmentation, suggesting its involvement in tarsal segment formation. We have cloned the PZ22 gene and partially determined its sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence contained a zinc finger motif found in DNA/RNA binding proteins. By in situ hybridization, we determined that the PZ22 gene was transcribed in the leg disc in a pattern identical to that of the lacZ expression. In addition, it was expressed transiently in the embryonic mesoderm during mesoderm segmentation. The PZ22 gene, therefore, may function both in mesodermal segmentation in the embryo and in tarsal segmentation in the imaginal disc.",1995,"Satoshi Goto, Teiichi Tanimura, Yoshiki Hotta, Satoshi Goto, Teiichi Tanimura, Yoshiki Hotta"
Polygenic mutation in Drosophila melanogaster: genetic analysis of selection lines,7768439,,"We have conducted genetic analyses of 12 long-term selection lines of Drosophila melanogaster derived from a highly inbred base population, containing new mutations affecting abdominal and sternopleural bristle number. Biometric analysis of the number of effective factors differentiating the selected lines from the base inbred indicated that with the exception of the three lines selected for increased number of abdominal bristles, three or more mutations contributed to the responses of the selection lines. Analysis of the chromosomal distribution of effects revealed that mutations affecting abdominal bristle number occurred on all three major chromosomes. In addition, Y-linked mutations with effects ranging from one to three bristles occurred in all three lines selected for decreased number of abdominal bristles, as well as in one line selected for increased abdominal bristle number. Mutations affecting sternopleural bristle number were mainly on the X and third chromosomes. One abdominal and one sternopleural selection line showed evidence of a segregating lethal with large effects on bristle number. As an indirect test for allelism of mutations occurring in different selection lines, the three lines selected in the same direction for the same trait were crossed in all possible combinations, and selection continued from the F2 hybrids. Responses of the hybrid lines usually did not exceed those of the most extreme parental lines, indicating that the responses of the parental lines may have been partly due to mutations at the same loci, although other interpretations are possible.",1995,"J D Fry, K A deRonde, T F Mackay, J D Fry, K A deRonde, T F Mackay"

We found that the evolution of AMY1 through AMY6 electromorphs occurred by sequential accumulation of single amino acid substitutions each causing one charge difference. The nucleotide diversities at synonymous sites within Amy1,Amy2,Amy3,Amy4 and Amy6 were 0.0321, 0.0000, 0.0355, 0.0059 and 0.0030, respectively. We also obtained evidence of genetic exchanges, such as intrachromosomal recombination, interchromosomal recombination or gene conversion, between the two duplicated Amy genes as well as among the alleles.",1995,"N Inomata, H Shibata, E Okuyama, T Yamazaki, N Inomata, H Shibata, E Okuyama, T Yamazaki"

Differential expression of the distinct adipokinetic hormone precursor genes during flight activity",7559443,10.1074/jbc.270.39.23038,"Three distinct cDNAs encoding the preproadipokinetic hormones I, II, and III (prepro-AKH I, II, and III), respectively, of Locusta migratoria have been isolated and sequenced. The three L. migratoria AKH precursors have an overall architecture similar to that of other precursors of the AKH/red pigment-concentrating hormone (RPCH) family identified so far. The AKH I and II precursors of L. migratoria are highly homologous to the Schistocerca gregaria and Schistocerca nitans AKH precursors. Although the L. migratoria AKH III precursor appears to be the least homologous to the Manduca sexta, Drosophila melanogaster, and Carcinus maenas AKH/RPCH precursors, we favor the opinion that the L. migratoria AKH III precursor is evolutionary more related to the M. sexta, D. melanogaster, and C. maenas AKH/RPCH precursors than to the AKH I and II precursors of S. gregaria, S. nitans, or L. migratoria. In situ hybridization showed signals for the different AKH mRNAs to be co-localized in cell bodies of the glandular lobes of the corpora cardiaca. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of single mRNA species encoding the AKH I precursor (approximately 570 bases), AKH II precursor (approximately 600 bases), and AKH III precursor (approximately 670 bases), respectively.

Females of both species respond to stress by a decrease in the activity of JH esterase. This decrease is realized through a decrease in the amount of protein. JH metabolism in males does not change after heat stress.

Drosophila C virus: experimental study of infectious yields and underlying pathology in Drosophila melanogaster laboratory populations,7745279,10.1006/jipa.1995.1037,"The underlying pathology of a nonhereditary virus, the Drosophila C virus, was studied. This study was related to the contamination routes (ingestion or contact) and developmental timing. When oral contamination occurred at the first larval instar: (1) the flies were contaminated, (2) the flies which had developed the most rapidly were the most infected, (3) in newly emerged females, the level of virus was higher than in newly emerged males, (4) when infected flies were reared on virus-free medium only males lost their virus. Moreover, oral contamination of adults was very efficient, but the highest virus yield was obtained when both larvae and imagos grew on virus-contaminated medium. About 30 to 50% of the flies died on the sixth day. They were as DCVC invaded as DCVC-injected flies. It seemed that when the virus yield was higher than a given threshold, all flies died, whatever had been the contamination routes. When contaminated adult females and virus-free males were reared together on a virus-free medium, females could infect males. In contrast, contaminated males were not able to infect virus-free females. Thus, only females were able to contaminate a rearing medium or other flies.",1995,"E Gomariz-Zilber, M Poras, M Thomas-Orillard, E Gomariz-Zilber, M Poras, M Thomas-Orillard"

Cis and trans interactions between the iab regulatory regions and abdominal-A and abdominal-B in Drosophila melanogaster,7713435,,"The infra-abdominal (iab) elements in the bithorax complex of Drosophila melanogaster regulate the transcription of the homeotic genes abdominal-A (abd-A) and Abdominal-B (Abd-B) in cis. Here we describe two unusual aspects of regulation by the iab elements, revealed by an analysis of an unexpected complementation between mutations in the Abd-B transcription unit and these regulatory regions. First, we find that iab-6 and iab-7 can regulate Abd-B in trans. This iab trans regulation is insensitive to chromosomal rearrangements that disrupt transvection effects at the nearby Ubx locus. In addition, we show that a transposed Abd-B transcription unit and promoter on the Y chromosome can be activated by iab elements located on the third chromosome. These results suggest that the iab regions can regulate their target promoter located at a distant site in the genome in a manner that is much less dependent on homologue pairing than other transvection effects. The iab regulatory regions may have a very strong affinity for the target promoter, allowing them to interact with each other despite the inhibitory effects of chromosomal rearrangements. Second, by generating abd-A mutations on rearrangement chromosomes that break in the iab-7 region, we show that these breaks induce the iab elements to switch their target promoter from Abd-B to abd-A. These two unusual aspects of iab regulation are related by the iab-7 breakpoint chromosomes that prevent iab elements from acting on Abd-B and allow them to act on abd-A. We propose that the iab-7 breaks prevent both iab trans regulation and target specificity by disrupting a mechanism that targets the iab regions to the Abd-B promoter.",1995,"J E Hendrickson, S Sakonju, J E Hendrickson, S Sakonju"

Mutations of zeste that mediate transvection are recessive enhancers of position-effect variegation in Drosophila melanogaster,8536972,,"Evidence is presented demonstrating that mutations of zeste, particularly the null state, are strong recessive enhancers of position-effect variegation (PEV) for the white, roughest and Notch loci. The zeste locus encodes a DNA-binding protein that acts as a transcription factor and mediates transvection phenomena at several loci. Its involvement with these seemingly diverse phenomena suggests that the normal zeste product functions in the decondensation of chromatin. A model is presented proposing that zeste is important for opening and stabilizing domains of chromatin, a step in gene determination and the establishment of cell memory. It postulates that chromatin domains that have been structurally modified by chromosomal rearrangement or by insertion of transposable elements are particularly sensitive to the absence or modification of the zeste protein. Such a view unifies the role of zeste in transcription, transvection and PEV.",1995,"B H Judd, B H Judd"

Moreover, the mus308 mutation has been proposed as an animal model for the study of Fanconi's anemia. In order to obtain more information about the function controlled by this locus, we have measured the mutability of the mus308 mutant to several mutagens with different modes of action using the sex-linked recessive lethal test. We show that this mutation confers hypermutability not only to the cross-linking agents tested, hexamethylphosphoramide and hexamethylmelamine, but to the point mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea as well, whereas the response to methyl methanesulfonate was normal. The results suggest that the mus308 locus is not defective in a repair pathway specific for cross-links but is rather involved in a step of a more general post-replication repair process responsible for the removal of non-excised adducts.",1995,"I Aguirrezabalaga, L M Sierra, M A Comendador, I Aguirrezabalaga, L M Sierra, M A Comendador"

Failure of conventional containment measures emphasizes the need for additional approaches, such as transformation of vector insects with genes that restrict vectorial capacity. The availability of an efficient promoter to drive foreign genes in transgenic insects is a necessary tool to test the feasibility of such approach. Here we characterize the putative promoter region of a black fly midgut carboxypeptidase gene and show that these sequences correctly direct the expression of a beta-glucuronidase reporter in Drosophila melanogaster.

The localization of the transposable elements (TEs) P, mdg1, Dm412, copia, gypsy and B104 was determined in all isogenic derivatives by in situ hybridization. The total number of the TE sites over all lines was 180. A comparison of the distribution of the TEs in the isogenic lines revealed the location of sites typical of lines with similar penetrance, no matter which parental line was involved. The results obtained suggest that such typical sites appear to tag the genome regions where the polygenes affecting the character in question are most likely to be found.",1995,"D P Furman, S N Rodin, T A Kozhemiakina, D P Furman, S N Rodin, T A Kozhemiakina"
The Drosophila melanogaster homolog of the mammalian MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK-2) lacks a proline-rich N-terminus,7590268,10.1016/0378-1119(95)00279-f,"Recently, a mammalian kinase cascade was discovered that is triggered by stress and heat shock, and leads to the stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK-2). Surprisingly, this process turns out to be independent of the classical MAPK. The stress-induced activation of MAPKAPK-2, in turn, results in the phosphorylation of small heat-shock proteins (Hsp). We have isolated a Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) cDNA encoding a polypeptide that has extensive sequence similarity to the mammalian MAPKAPK-2. As in mammalian MAPKAPK-2, the Dm MAPKAPK-2 possesses a MAPK phosphorylation site and a nuclear targeting sequence located C-terminal to the catalytic domain. However, in contrast to its mammalian counterpart, it lacks the Pro-rich N-terminal region proposed to form Src-homology domain 3 (SH3) binding domains. A 2.4-kb MAPKAPK-2 message is expressed throughout development, while two shorter transcripts of 2.3 and 1.8 kb appear to be specifically expressed in the germline.

Structure and regulation of the fushi tarazu gene from Drosophila hydei,28306077,10.1007/BF00357762,"The Drosophila melanogaster segmentation gene fushi tarazu (ftz) encodes a homeodomain-type transcription factor involved in the control of larval pattern formation. Loss of function mutations cause an embryonic lethal, pair-rule phenotype. The segmentation defects, but not the lethality, can be partially rescued by the ftz orthologue from Drosophila hydei. In this work, the primary structure, expression and regulation of the D. hydei ftz gene was characterized. Sequence comparisons classify ftz as a rather fast evolving gene. However, since the homeodomain of the D. hydei FTZ protein is highly similar to that of D. melanogaster, proper regulation of D. melanogaster ftz downstream genes would be expected. In D. melanogaster embryos, a D. hydei ftz transgene is expressed normally, independent of endogenous ftz gene activity, suggesting that D. hydei ftz regulatory sequences are correctly recognized by D. melanogaster transcription factors. Accordingly, lacZ fusion constructs driven by the D. hydei ftz upstream element are expressed normally in D. melanogaster embryos. Altogether, the similarities between the two ftz orthologues by far outweigh the differences. The limited success of the trans-species rescue might be, therefore, a consequence of the accumulation of too many subtle changes in gene function, exceeding the limits of developmental plasticity during fly embryogenesis.",1995,"Wolfgang Jost, Yan Yu, Leslie Pick, Anette Preiss, Dieter Maier"

Therefore, it is of great interest to elucidate the mechanisms by which cytostatic drugs exert their mutagenic and/or carcinogenic activity besides the anticancer effect and the possible relationship among them. A useful and informative approach to this problem is the analysis of the mutation spectra induced by these drugs in eukaryotic organisms. Sequence analysis of the mutations induced by hexamethylmelamine, a crosslinking agent extensively used in the treatment of ovarian cancer, in male germ cells of Drosophila was conducted using the v locus as reporter gene. Both intra-locus and multi-locus deletions were induced whereas based changes were almost absent. Thus, it is proposed that deletions are likely to be involved in the generation of second malignancies in hexamethylmelamine-treated patients. It has to be stressed that systems, such as v, capable of efficiently recovering mutations caused by big losses of DNA, should be used for the study of mutational spectra induced by cross-linking agents.",1995,"I Aguirrezabalaga, M J Nivard, M A Comendador, E W Vogel, I Aguirrezabalaga, M J Nivard, M A Comendador, E W Vogel"
Drosophila GABA-gated chloride channel: modified [3H]EBOB binding site associated with Ala-->Ser or Gly mutants of Rdl subunit,7885191,10.1016/0024-3205(95)00006-r,"The non-competitive blocker site of the GABA-gated chloride ion channel in normal susceptible strains of Drosophila melanogaster and simulans binds 4-n-[3H]propyl-4'-ethynylbicycloorthobenzoate ([3H]EBOB) at specific sites with KdS of 1.6-1.9 nM and BmaxS of 171-181 fmol/mg protein. This specific binding of [3H]EBOB is strongly inhibited by: a large number and variety of insecticidal channel blockers at 20 nM (lindane, alpha-endosulfan, dieldrin, 12-ketoendrin, fipronil, and a representative bicycloorthobenzoate and dithiane) or 200 nM (picrotoxinin); the insecticidal channel activators avermectin and moxidectin at 20 nM; muscimol at 30 microM and GABA at 300 microM. Cyclodiene resistance in D. melanogaster has been attributed to a mutation resulting in an Ala302-->Ser replacement in the Rdl GABA receptor subunit and in D. simulans to an homologous Ala-->Ser or Gly replacement. These mutations are shown here to greatly reduce [3H]EBOB binding, i.e. lower affinity and apparent number of binding sites. The Ala-->Ser replacement with both melanogaster and simulans almost always reduces the potency in inhibiting [3H]EBOB binding of each of eight channel blockers and of muscimol and GABA. The Ala-->Gly replacement in D. simulans is generally less effective than the Ala-->Ser modification in reducing sensitivity to the channel blockers and to muscimol and GABA. The channel activators avermectin and moxidectin usually retain their inhibitory potency in the Rdl subunit mutants. Thus, it appears that replacement of Ala by Ser generally modifies the non-competitive blocker site and its coupling to the GABA-recognition site with less effect on the channel activator site. In contrast, the Ala-->Gly replacement has less impact in protecting the chloride channel from the action of insecticidal blockers. Each of the resistant strains has the same level of resistance to the lethal action of the five channel blockers examined but none to avermectins and muscimol.",1995,"L M Cole, R T Roush, J E Casida, L M Cole, R T Roush, J E Casida"

Intense staining in the glomeruli of the antennal lobes, the region of the nervous system containing terminals of antennal olfactory sensory neurones and mechanosensory neurones, indicates possible roles for this mAChR gene product in the processing of olfactory and mechanosensory signals in the fly.

CHROMOSOMAL REPATTERNING AND LINKAGE GROUP CONSERVATION IN MOSQUITO KARYOTYPIC EVOLUTION,28567783,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1994.tb01301.x,"Chromosome number and morphology in mosquitoes is remarkably uniform: virtually all mosquitoes have a diploid chromosome number of six (2N = 6), and their chromosomes are invariably metacentric or submetacentric. Numerical changes obviously have not been important in mosquito chromosomal evolution, and because of the morphological similarity of their chromosomes, it appears that structural changes have played little or no role in mosquito karyotypic evolution. The goal of the present study was to identify the types and relative numbers of chromosomal changes in mosquito evolution and to extend the comparison where possible to the higher diptera. To do this, we compared the enzyme linkage maps of six species of Aedes to each other and to enzyme maps of seven other mosquito species and to Drosophila melanogaster. Our results indicate that Aedes chromosomes have been modified by inversions, most which were paracentric, and by translocations, most which were Robertsonian. Intrageneric comparison of Aedes enzyme maps also revealed groups of linked enzyme loci whose integrity has been maintained throughout Aedes evolution (conserved linkages/syntenies). Intergeneric comparisons of Aedes enzyme maps with those of species in the genera Culex, Anopheles, and Toxorhynchites disclosed conserved associations of enzyme loci between mosquito genera. These findings lead us to postulate that the ancestral mosquito karyotype consisted of six chromosomal elements which, other than being combined in different ways in various mosquito groups, have remained essentially intact during mosquito evolution. Furthermore, the identification of groups of linked enzyme loci common to mosquitoes and to D. melanogaster indicates that linkage group conservation may characterize the karyotypic evolution of all dipteran insects.",1994,"T C Matthews, L E Munstermann, T C Matthews, L E Munstermann"
The cytochrome b region in the mitochondrial DNA of the ant Tetraponera rufoniger: sequence divergence in Hymenoptera may be associated with nucleotide content,8006995,10.1007/BF00176090,"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequencing of single-stranded DNA yielded sequence information from the cytochrome b (cyt b) region in mitochondrial DNA from the ant Tetraponera rufoniger. Compared with the cyt b genes from Apis mellifera, Drosophila melanogaster, and D. yakuba, the overall A+T content (A+T%) of that of T. rufoniger is lower (69.9% vs 80.7%, 74.2%, and 73.9%, respectively) than those of the other three. The codon usage in the cyt b gene of T. rufoniger is biased although not as much as in A. mellifera, D. melanogaster, and D. yakuba; T. rufoniger has eight unused codons whereas D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, and A. mellifera have 21, 20, and 23, respectively. The inferred cyt b polypeptide chain (PPC) of T. rufoniger has diverged at least as much from a common ancestor with D. yakuba as has that of A. mellifera (approximately 3.5 vs approximately 2.9). Despite the lower A+T%, the relative frequencies of amino acids in the cyt b PPC of T. rufoniger are significantly (P < 0.05) associated with the content of adenine and thymine (A+T%) and size of codon families. The mitochondrially located cytochrome oxidase subunit II genes (CO-II) of endopterygote insects have significantly higher average A+T% (approximately 75%) than those of exopterygous (approximately 69%) and paleopterous (approximately 69%) insects. The increase in A+T% of endopterygote insects occurred in Upper Carboniferous and coincided with a significant acceleration of PPC divergence. However, acceleration of PPC divergence is not significantly correlated with the increase of the A+T% (P > 0.1). The high A+T%, the biased codon usage, and the increased PPC divergence of Hymenoptera can in that respect most easily be explained by directional mutation pressure which began in the Upper Carboniferous and still occurs in most members of the order. Given the roughly identical A+T% of the cyt b and CO-II genes from the other insects whose DNA sequences are known (A. mellifera, D. melanogaster, and D. yakuba), it seems most likely that the A+T% of T. rufoniger declined secondarily within the last 100 Myr as a result of a reduced directional mutation pressure.",1994,"L S Jermiin, R H Crozier, L S Jermiin, R H Crozier"
Evidence for positive selection in the superoxide dismutase (Sod) region of Drosophila melanogaster,8013910,,"DNA sequence variation in a 1410-bp region including the Cu,Zn Sod locus was examined in 41 homozygous lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Fourteen lines were from Barcelona, Spain, 25 were from California populations and the other two were from laboratory stocks. Two common electromorphs, SODS and SODF, are segregating in the populations. Our sample of 41 lines included 19 SodS and 22 SodF alleles (henceforward referred to as Slow and Fast alleles). All 19 Slow alleles were identical in sequence. Of the 22 Fast alleles sequenced, nine were identical in sequence and are referred to as the Fast A haplotypes. The Slow allele sequence differed from the Fast A haplotype at a single nucleotide site, the site that accounts for the amino acid difference between SODS and SODF. There were nine other haplotypes among the remaining 13 Fast alleles sequenced. The overall level of nucleotide diversity (pi) in this sample is not greatly different than that found at other loci in D. melanogaster. It is concluded that the Slow/Fast polymorphism is a recently arisen polymorphism, not an old balanced polymorphism. The large group of nearly identical haplotypes suggests that a recent mutation, at the Sod locus or tightly linked to it, has increased rapidly in frequency to around 50%, both in California and Spain. The application of a new statistical test demonstrates that the occurrence of such large numbers of haplotypes with so little variation among them is very unlikely under the usual equilibrium neutral model. We suggest that the high frequency of some haplotypes is due to natural selection at the Sod locus or at a tightly linked locus.",1994,"R R Hudson, K Bailey, D Skarecky, J Kwiatowski, F J Ayala, R R Hudson, K Bailey, D Skarecky, J Kwiatowski, F J Ayala"

SUHW blocks an enhancer only when positioned between the enhancer and promoter. Although position dependent, SUHW enhancer blocking is distance independent. These properties indicate that SUHW does not interact with the transcription activator proteins that bind to enhancers. To explore if DNA distortions are involved in enhancer blocking, the ability of SUHW to alter DNA structure was examined in gel mobility assays. Indeed, SUHW induces an unusual change in the structure of the binding-site DNA. The change is not a directed DNA bend but correlates with loss of sequence-directed bends in the unbound DNA. The DNA distortion requires a SUHW protein domain not required for DNA binding, and mutant proteins that fail to alter DNA structure also fail to eliminate the sequence-directed bends. These results suggest that SUHW increases DNA flexibility. The DNA distortion is not sufficient to block enhancers, and therefore it is suggested that increased DNA flexibility may help SUHW interact and interfere with proteins that support long-distance enhancer-promoter interactions.",1994,"B Shen, J Kim, D Dorsett, B Shen, J Kim, D Dorsett"
PCR-based homology probing reveals a family of GABA receptor-like genes in Drosophila melanogaster,8025558,10.1016/0965-1748(94)90029-9,"A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based homology probing strategy was employed to screen Drosophila melanogaster genomic DNA for sequences encoding a conserved amino acid 'signature motif' known to be present in vertebrate GABA receptor and glycine receptor subunit genes. This approach yielded three discrete amplified sequence elements (designated LCCH1, LCCH2, and LCCH3) that contained open reading frames and > 40% amino acid sequence identity to the corresponding regions of vertebrate ligand-gated chloride channel genes. Genomic DNA clones corresponding to each element were isolated and sequenced, and predicted amino acid sequences corresponding to the second (M2) and third (M3) transmembrane domains of vertebrate genes were analyzed for identity or similarity to known sequences. LCCH1 was identical to the Rdl gene, a known GABA receptor subunit gene from D. melanogaster, whereas LCCH2 and LCCH3 were novel D. melanogaster sequences that exhibited structural similarity to other members of the ligand-gated chloride channel gene family. LCCH2 was equally divergent in M2 and M3 (46-49% amino acid identity) from all other known members of this family and may therefore represent a new subunit or receptor class within this family. LCCH2 was localized by in situ hybridization to cytogenetic region 75A on the left arm of chromosome 3. LCCH3 was closely related to mammalian (79% amino acid identity) and snail (96% amino acid identity) GABA receptor beta subunits and may therefore be the homologue in D. melanogaster of this subunit class. LCCH3 was localized by in situ hybridization to cytogenetic region 13F on the X chromosome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1994,"J E Henderson, D C Knipple, D M Soderlund, J E Henderson, D C Knipple, D M Soderlund"
Analysis of immunocytochemical staining patterns in the antennal system of Drosophila melanogaster,8118844,10.1007/BF00305373,"By immunizing mice with homogenized brains, heads, or a mixture of heads and antennae of D. melanogaster, we obtained six monoclonal antibodies (mabs) that bind to the olfactory system of Drosophila with various degrees of specificity. They can be divided into three groups with respect to their staining pattern: (1) The antibodies ca51/2, na21/2, and nb230 label both in the third (olfactory) antennal segment and in the visual ganglia. All of them bind to antennal structures that can be correlated with basiconic sensilla. The antibody ca51/2 labels sensory neurons of these sensilla. In the antenna of the lozenge mutant, which lacks basiconic sensilla, no labeling is present. In Western blots ca51/2 recognizes in the antenna an antigen of 43.5 kDa, which is expressed in the antenna only in the presence of basiconic sensilla. The antibody na21/2 binds to basiconic and coeloconic sensilla, most likely to the apical part of sheath cells. In immunoblots it recognizes in the antenna two antigens of 42.2 kDa and 46.7 kDa. The latter appears to be correlated in the antenna with the presence of basiconic sensilla. (2) The staining pattern of antibody nc10 is associated with the sheath cells of basiconic and coeloconic sensilla. Moreover, nc10 binds to a subset of glomeruli in the antennal lobe. (3) The staining pattern of the antibodies VG2 and I24B5 is restricted to the antenna. I24B5 recognizes coeloconic sensilla and VG2 recognizes both coeloconic and basiconic sensilla. Staining patterns in both cases include sheath cells.",1994,"K F StÃ¶rtkuhl, A Hofbauer, V Keller, N Gendre, R F Stocker, K F StÃ¶rtkuhl, A Hofbauer, V Keller, N Gendre, R F Stocker"
"Yolk protein factor 1 is a Drosophila homolog of Ku, the DNA-binding subunit of a DNA-dependent protein kinase from humans",8157678,,"Yolk protein factor 1 (YPF1) is a heterodimeric DNA-binding protein from Drosophila melanogaster. In this report, we describe evidence that YPF1 is a homolog of Ku, a human autoimmune antigen that is the DNA-binding subunit of a DNA-dependent protein kinase. In vitro this kinase phosphorylates several transcription factors and, at the time of transcription initiation, the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. We find that a cDNA clone for the smaller subunit (beta) of YPF1 encodes a 72-kDa protein that has extensive homology to the smaller subunit of the heterodimeric Ku protein (24% identity, 51% similarity over the entire 631 amino acid length). Further, the larger YPF1 subunit (alpha) shares immunological epitopes with the larger subunit of Ku. YPF1 and Ku also appear to bind DNA similarly. Southwestern blot experiments demonstrate that, like the Ku protein, the smaller YPF1 subunit binds DNA in the absence of the larger subunit. Further, cross-linking experiments indicate that, once again like the Ku protein, both subunits make contact with DNA when YPF1 binds as a heterodimer. YPF1 beta transcripts occur at low levels in all stages of Drosophila development except during oogenesis and early embryogenesis when they increase 25-fold. In situ hybridization localizes the beta gene to position 34C on the left arm of chromosome 2.",1994,"D B Jacoby, P C Wensink, D B Jacoby, P C Wensink"
Insertional mutagenesis of Drosophila heterochromatin with single P elements,8170943,10.1073/pnas.91.9.3539,"Insertional mutagenesis with transposable P elements has greatly facilitated the identification and analysis of genes located throughout the 70% of the Drosophila melanogaster genome classified as euchromatin. In contrast, genetically marked P elements have only rarely been shown to transpose into heterochromatin. By carrying out single P element insertional mutagenesis under conditions where position-effect variegation was suppressed, we efficiently generated strains containing insertions at diverse sites within centromeric and Y-chromosome heterochromatin. The tendency of P elements to transpose locally was shown to operate within heterochromatin, and it further enhanced the recovery of heterochromatic insertions. Three of the insertions disrupted vital genes known to be present at low density in heterochromatin. Strains containing single P element insertions will greatly facilitate the structural and functional analysis of this poorly understood genomic component.",1994,"P Zhang, A C Spradling, P Zhang, A C Spradling"

Multiple genetic control of acetate-induced olfactory responses in Drosophila melanogaster larvae,7989222,10.1038/hdy.1994.192,"Behavioural responses of Drosophila melanogaster larvae were measured in response to olfactory stimulation with an homologous series of eight aliphatic n-acetates (methyl ... octyl acetate) and with cis-vaccenyl acetate. Larvae tended to be attracted to short-chain acetates (methyl ... pentyl) and repelled by longer chain acetates (hexyl, heptyl and octyl acetate). All larvae were strongly attracted to propyl acetate, irrespective of the dose studied. Larval olfactory responses generally declined with age. Two geographical strains showed specific anosmias. Katsunuma (Japan) larvae showed no response to hexyl acetate; chromosome substitution showed this behaviour to be controlled by genes on chromosome II. Tai (Ivory Coast) larvae showed no response to pentyl acetate; chromosome substitution showed that two genetic factors were primarily involved, on the X chromosome and chromosome III. The response was modulated by chromosome II. No effect of the Y chromosome was found. Two olfactory mutants were studied, olfC (X chromosome) and Indf (chromosome III); both mutants showed abnormal responses to certain acetates.

Lysis of allogeneic and syngeneic target cells by primary cytotoxic T lymphocytes induced in vitro by Drosophila melanogaster cells,8002033,10.1016/0165-2478(94)90128-7,"Incubation of unprimed splenocytes directly with synthetic peptides induces CD8+ primary CTL in vitro. The ability of peptide-pretreated LPS blasts or H-2Db-expressing Drosophila melanogaster cells to induce peptide-reactive primary CTL was analysed using synthetic peptides corresponding to distinct and overlapping amino acids in SV40 T antigen Db-restricted T-cell epitopes I, II-III, and V. Peptide-pretreated, but not untreated, LPS blasts induced strong peptide-reactive CTL in splenocytes of naive C57 BL/6 mice. The reactivity of these CTL was indistinguishable from that of CTL induced by direct stimulation of spleen cells with peptides. In contrast, effector cells induced by untreated or peptide-pretreated drosophila cells expressed equivalent cytolysis both against untreated and peptide-pretreated syngeneic target cells. They also strongly lysed the allogeneic (H-2d) P815 target cells. The cytolytic activity was expressed by CD8+ T lymphocytes. However, the lack of specificity and restriction was probably due to stimulation of LAK cells as well. The CTL-inducing potential of the drosophila cells was stable at 46 degrees C. Peptide-activated splenocytes cultured for 1 month in medium supplemented with spent medium from drosophila growth culture were 75% B cells and 25% CD4+ T cells. Taken together, these results indicated that LPS blasts are efficient APC for induction of primary CTL and that drosophila cell-derived molecule(s) are capable of inducing broad-reactive effector cells and may also assume the function of leukocyte growth factor(s).",1994,"A R Alsheikhly, A R Alsheikhly"
Gross chromosome rearrangements mediated by transposable elements in Drosophila melanogaster,8031304,10.1002/bies.950160410,"A combination of cytogenetic and molecular analyses has shown that several different transposable elements are involved in the restructuring of Drosophila chromosomes. Two kinds of elements, P and hobo, are especially prone to induce chromosome rearrangements. The mechanistic details of this process are unclear, but, at least some of the time, it seems to involve ectopic recombination between elements inserted at different chromosomal sites; the available data suggest that these ectopic recombination events are much more likely to occur between elements in the same chromosome than between elements in different chromosomes. Other Drosophila transposons also appear to mediate chromosome restructuring by ectopic recombination; these include the retrotransposons BEL, roo, Doc and I and the foldback element FB. In addition, two retrotransposons, HeT-A and TART, have been found to be associated specifically with the ends of Drosophila chromosomes. Very limited data indicate that transposon-mediated chromosome restructuring is occurring in natural populations of Drosophila. This suggests that transposable elements may help to shape the structure of the Drosophila genome and implies that they may have a similar role in other organisms.",1994,"J K Lim, M J Simmons, J K Lim, M J Simmons"

Various lines of evidence imply that Delta and Notch proteins function as signal and receptor in cellular interactions required for the partitioning of fates among cells within equivalence groups in many developmental contexts. Molecular and genetic observations provide a framework for the formulation of hypotheses concerning the mechanisms by which the Delta ligand and Notch receptor interact and the Delta-Notch signal is transduced in a manner that can affect the adoption of distinct fates by different cells. In particular, emerging evidence regarding the expression and function of Delta and Notch during development also raise possible alternatives to the currently favored hypothesis that Delta-Notch interactions generate instructive signals that mediate a process termed lateral inhibition.",1994,"M A Muskavitch, M A Muskavitch"
Characterization of class II and class III ADP-ribosylation factor genes and proteins in Drosophila melanogaster,8063793,,"ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are ubiquitous approximately 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that enhance the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of cholera toxin and are involved in intracellular vesicular transport. Based on size, phylogenetic analysis, amino acid identity, and gene structure, mammalian ARFs fall into three classes (class I, ARF1, -2, and -3; class II, ARF4 and -5; class III, ARF6). A class I ARF had been identified in Drosophila melanogaster. To search for ARFs of other classes in Drosophila, polymerase chain reaction-based techniques were used, resulting in cloning of Drosophila ARF (dARF) II and dARF III with deduced amino acid sequences similar to those of class II and class III mammalian ARFs, respectively. The three Drosophila ARF genes map to different chromosomes and the coding regions have different splicing sites. dARF II mRNA, like ARF I mRNA, is fairly uniformly distributed throughout adult flies, whereas dARF III mRNA is significantly more abundant in heads than in legs or bodies. Recombinant dARF II and dARF III have biochemical and immunological properties similar to those of human ARF5 (hARF5) and hARF6, respectively. These observations are consistent with the conclusion that the three classes of ARFs are present in non-mammalian as well as mammalian species.",1994,"F J Lee, L A Stevens, L M Hall, J J Murtagh Jr, Y L Kao, J Moss, M Vaughan, F J Lee, L A Stevens, L M Hall, J J Murtagh Jr, Y L Kao, J Moss, M Vaughan"

Wild-type males rapidly condition to immature males and modify their behaviour toward subsequent target flies. The weaker EDCM phenotype of inactive males is similar to that of dunce males. Using time-sampling, habituation is most rapid for wild-type males and slowest for dunce males, with inactive males showing an intermediate phenotype.

Many pleiotropic effects of this syndrome have been described previously for females, but little was known about possible pleiotropic effects in males. The effects on males open up new avenues for the action of natural selection operating on the system. In females, the syndrome causes an increase in egg-to-adult development time, precocious sexual maturation, increased fecundity and decreased longevity. In addition to the cuticle phenotype, in males abnormal abdomen causes delayed sexual maturation, increased longevity, and decreased mating success, yet no change in egg-to-adult development time. Thus the syndrome has opposing fitness effects in the two sexes, which may help explain the genetic polymorphism observed in this system.

Directed overexpression of suppressor 2 of zeste and Posterior Sex Combs results in bristle abnormalities in Drosophila melanogaster,8313990,10.1006/dbio.1994.1039,"Three dominant second-chromosome rearrangement mutations in Drosophila melanogaster, Aristapedioid1 (Arp), vestigial-Depilate (vgD), and vestigial62 (vg62), result in developmental abnormalities of the bristle sense organs on the notum, abdomen, legs, and wing margin. The bristle abnormalities are associated with overexpression of Suppressor 2 of zeste (Su(z)2). We constructed and transformed into flies Hsp70:cDNA constructs for Su(z)2 and the related and neighboring Polycomb group (Pc-G) gene Posterior Sex Combs (Psc). Heat shock-induced overexpression of these two genes (hs-Su(z)2 and hs-Psc) resulted in similar bristle abnormalities that in a developmental stage-specific manner mimicked those seen with the three rearrangement mutations. In addition, hs-Psc overexpression at white prepupae was lethal. The bristle abnormalities are reminiscent of those seen with reduced function of Notch, a neurogenic gene. We found that hs-Su(z)2 overexpression reduced the expression of a lac z enhancer trap in the neurogenic gene neuralized. Previous experiments found that loss of function mutations in Su(z)2 resulted in no bristle abnormalities. Analysis of Psc mitotic clones revealed no essential function of Psc in bristle development. Antibody staining of salivary gland polytene chromosomes showed that after heat shock induction of hs-Psc, Psc protein binds ectopically to hundreds of polytene chromosome loci. These data suggest that the bristle abnormalities seen with overexpression of Su(z)2 and Psc may result from altered expression of genes involved in bristle sense organ development that are not normal regulatory targets of these genes.",1994,"E J Sharp, E C Martin, P N Adler, E J Sharp, E C Martin, P N Adler"

Aspects of nonrandom turnover involved in the concerted evolution of intergenic spacers within the ribosomal DNA of Drosophila melanogaster,7932779,10.1007/BF00163804,"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified, sequenced, and digitally typed intergenic spacers (IGSs) of the ribosomal (r)DNA in D. melanogaster reveal unexpected features of the mechanisms of turnover involved with the concerted evolution of the gene family. Characterization of the structure of three isolated IGS length variants reveals breakage ""hot spots"" within the 330-base-pair (bp) subrepeat array found in the spacers. Internal mapping of variant repeats within the 240-bp subrepeat array using a novel digital DNA typing procedure (minisatellite variant repeat [MVR]-PCR) shows an unexpected pattern of clustering of variant repeats. Each 240-bp subrepeat array consists of essentially two halves with the repeats in each half identified by specific mutations. This bipartite structure, observed in a cloned IGS unit, in the majority of genomic DNA of laboratory and wild flies and in PCR-amplified products, has been widely homogenized yet is not predicted by a model of unequal crossing over with randomly placed recombination breakpoints. Furthermore, wild populations contain large numbers of length variants in contrast to uniformly shared length variants in laboratory stocks. High numbers of length variants coupled to the observation of a homogenized bipartite structure of the 240-bp subrepeat array suggest that the unit of turnover and homogenization is smaller than the IGS and might involve gene conversion. The use of PCR for the structural analysis of members of the rDNA gene family coupled to digital DNA typing provides powerful new inroads into the mechanisms of DNA turnover affecting the course of molecular evolution in this family.",1994,"A R Linares, T Bowen, G A Dover, A R Linares, T Bowen, G A Dover"

"Igloo, a GAP-43-related gene expressed in the developing nervous system of Drosophila",7925024,,"GAP-43 (growth-associated protein, 43 x 10(3) M(r)) is an essential, membrane-associated, neuronal phosphoprotein in vertebrates. The protein is abundantly produced in the growth cones of developing and regenerating neurons, and it is phosphorylated upon induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Prior work has identified GAP-43-like proteins only in chordates. In this paper, a nervous system-specific gene from Drosophila melanogaster is described that encodes two proteins sharing biochemical activities and sequence homology with GAP-43. The region of homology encompasses the calmodulin-binding domain and protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site of GAP-43. The fly proteins are shown to bind Drosophila calmodulin (CaM), and are phosphorylated by purified PKC after a fashion predicted from prior work with vertebrate GAP-43. GAP-43 is modified by palmitoylation. An amino-terminal myristoylation site is described for the Drosophila protein, which may play a similar role in membrane association in the fly. While a small family of GAP-43-related genes has been recognized in vertebrates, only a single gene appears to be present in the fly. As the Drosophila gene encodes two proteins, each with multiple calmodulin-binding domains and repeated sites for PKC phosphorylation, it may afford functions provided by the family of vertebrate genes.",1994,"V A Neel, M W Young, V A Neel, M W Young"
Isolation of Drosophila CREB-B: a novel CRE-binding protein,8397816,10.1089/dna.1993.12.589,"CREB is a DNA-binding protein that stimulates gene transcription upon activation of the cAMP signaling pathway. The mammalian CREB protein consists of an amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain and a carboxy-terminal DNA-binding domain comprised of a basic region and a leucine zipper. Recent studies have shown that the mammalian CREB is one of many transcription factors that can bind to the cAMP regulated enhancer (CRE) sequence. Consequently, a complete understanding of regulation through the CRE sequence requires the elucidation of how the various CRE-binding proteins interact with each other. To accomplish this goal, we have begun to characterize the family of CRE-binding proteins in a system that is amenable to genetic manipulations, Drosophila melanogaster. We have previously cloned a protein designated dCREB-A from a Drosophila embryonic cDNA library. Here, we describe an additional member of the Drosophila CREB gene family, isolated by screening a lambda gt11 library of adult Drosophila head cDNAs with a multimerized CRE sequence. This protein, dCREB-B, contains 285 amino acids and is remarkably similar within the basic/zipper region to the corresponding portion of mammalian CREB. In contrast, the dCREB-B and mammalian CREB zipper domains differ considerably from the dCREB-A zipper in both length and composition. However, the putative DNA binding domains for all three proteins are highly conserved. The activator region of dCREB-B is completely different from that of both mammalian CREB and dCREB-A.

"Domain mapping of tube, a protein essential for dorsoventral patterning of the Drosophila embryo",8253071,,"The tube protein plays an essential role in the signal transduction pathway that establishes dorsoventral polarity in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo. Characterization of each of four tube mutants revealed a substitution or insertion in the amino-terminal half of the protein. This portion of the tube protein is also evolutionarily conserved, as demonstrated by isolation and sequencing of the Drosophila virilis tube gene. Moreover, RNA microinjection assays and germline transformation experiments demonstrated that the amino-terminal domain alone provides substantial levels of gene function: constructs encoding only the amino-terminal domain restore dorsoventral polarity to embryos lacking any maternal tube function. In the carboxyterminal domain, sequence conservation is concentrated in the five octapeptide repeats. Although the repeat-containing domain by itself provides no rescue of the tube maternal effect phenotype, it is necessary for wild-type levels of tube activity. This domain is thus likely to play an ancillary role in axis formation.",1993,"A Letsou, S Alexander, S A Wasserman, A Letsou, S Alexander, S A Wasserman"
Programmed cell death during Drosophila embryogenesis,8223253,,"The deliberate and orderly removal of cells by programmed cell death is a common phenomenon during the development of metazoan animals. We have examined the distribution and ultrastructural appearance of cell deaths that occur during embryogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. A large number of cells die during embryonic development in Drosophila. These cells display ultrastructural features that resemble apoptosis observed in vertebrate systems, including nuclear condensation, fragmentation and engulfment by macrophages. Programmed cell deaths can be rapidly and reliably visualized in living wild-type and mutant Drosophila embryos using the vital dyes acridine orange or nile blue. Acridine orange appears to selectively stain apoptotic forms of death in these preparations, since cells undergoing necrotic deaths were not significantly labelled. Likewise, toluidine blue staining of fixed tissues resulted in highly specific labelling of apoptotic cells, indicating that apoptosis leads to specific biochemical changes responsible for the selective affinity to these dyes. Cell death begins at stage 11 (approximately 7 hours) of embryogenesis and thereafter becomes widespread, affecting many different tissues and regions of the embryo. Although the distribution of dying cells changes drastically over time, the overall pattern of cell death is highly reproducible for any given developmental stage.

"Genetic and molecular analysis of the X chromosomal region 14B17-14C4 in Drosophila melanogaster: loss of function in NONA, a nuclear protein common to many cell types, results in specific physiological and behavioral defects",8244005,,"We have performed a genetic analysis of the 14C region of the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster to isolate loss of function alleles of no-on-transient A (nonA; 14C1-2; 1-52.3). NONA is a nuclear protein common to many cell types, which is present in many puffs on polytene chromosomes. Sequence data suggest that the protein contains a pair of RNA binding motifs (RRM) found in many single-strand nucleic acid binding proteins. Hypomorphic alleles of this gene, which lead to aberrant visual and courtship song behavior, still contain normally distributed nonA RNA and NONA protein in embryos, and in all available alleles NONA protein is present in puffs of third instar larval polytene chromosomes. We find that complete loss of this general nuclear protein is semilethal in hemizygous males and homozygous cell lethal in the female germline. Surviving males show more extreme defects in nervous system function than have been described for the hypomorphic alleles. Five other essential genes that reside within this region have been partially characterized.",1993,"R Stanewsky, K G Rendahl, M Dill, H Saumweber, R Stanewsky, K G Rendahl, M Dill, H Saumweber"
Elements controlling follicular expression of the s36 chorion gene during Drosophila oogenesis,8355717,10.1128/mcb.13.9.5898,"An 84-bp proximal regulatory protein (PRR) of the Drosophila melanogaster s36 chorion gene is sufficient for directing proper temporal and spatial expression of a reporter gene in three domains of the follicle: anterior, posterior, and main body. Here we show that the fidelity of PRR-directed s36 expression is dependent on the proper dorsal-ventral differentiation of the follicular epithelium, which requires the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor homolog. Transgenic analysis of site-directed mutants of the PRR suggests that s36 expression is regulated by the concerted action of multiple positive activators. Several cis-acting transcriptional elements have been identified: some appear to function in a quantitative manner, while others either are essential or appear to regulate expression in particular spatial domains. The approximate locations of these regulatory elements have been defined; some map within sequences that are strongly conserved in widely divergent dipteran species. In fact, the PRR analog of the medfly Ceratitis capitata Ccs36 gene directs expression in a manner similar to the D. melanogaster s36 PRR. We propose a model for transcriptional regulation of s36 based on the prechoriogenic polarization of the follicular epithelium that surrounds the developing egg chamber.",1993,"P P Tolias, M Konsolaki, M S Halfon, N D Stroumbakis, F C Kafatos, P P Tolias, M Konsolaki, M S Halfon, N D Stroumbakis, F C Kafatos"
Distribution of gypsy sequences in Drosophila species of the obscura subgroup,8392988,10.1111/j.1601-5223.1993.00131.x,"Eight Drosophila species of the obscura subgroup were screened for sequences homologous to the gypsy retrotransposon of D. melanogaster. Molecular characterization of gypsy sequences was first approached through digesting genomic DNAs from these obscura species with appropriate restriction enzymes and subjecting them to Southern blot analysis. The results of this analysis indicate that gypsy-homologous sequences are well conserved among species of the obscura subgroup. With the exception of D. guanche, all other species bear a 7 kb Xho I fragment that represents the complete element in D. melanogaster. Lower molecular weight fragments that could be deleted elements, are shared by different species. Both types of element probably existed before the divergence of this subgroup. Two different species clusters could be established on the basis of hybridization patterns, one represented by D. subobscura and its relative species D. guanche and D. madeirensis, and the other, in which D. obscura, D. tristis and D. subsilvestris are included.",1993,"T M Alberola, R de Frutos, T M Alberola, R de Frutos"
Linkage disequilibrium in the white locus region of Drosophila melanogaster,8276228,10.1017/s0016672300031694,"Linkage disequilibrium between molecular polymorphisms in a 10 kb region in the white locus of Drosophila melanogaster, revealed with a battery of four-cutter restriction enzymes, was investigated in 266 lines sampled from seven natural populations around the world. A total of 73 (35 restriction site, 37 insertion/deletion and 1 inversion) polymorphisms were detected, of which 55 non-unique polymorphisms were analysed for linkage disequilibrium. Clustering of significant linkage disequilibrium was observed in the transcriptional unit of the white locus as in Miyashita & Langley (1988). It was shown that about two thirds of the 2-locus combinations showing significant linkage disequilibrium have similar degree and direction of association over different populations. Despite lower divergence in allelic frequencies of molecular polymorphisms among populations, an increase in the proportion of 2-locus pairs showing significant linkage disequilibrium is observed in the transcriptional unit. Large values of Ohta's D measure ratio (1982a, b) cluster in the transcriptional unit, and correspond to significant linkage disequilibria.

Sulfite sensitivity and sulfite oxidase activity in Drosophila melanogaster,8122996,,"The relationship between sulfite oxidase (SO) and sulfite sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster is addressed. Significant improvements to the SO assay have provided an investigative tool which can be applied to further studies of this molybdoenzyme. Using the second-instar larval stage of D, melanogaster, we have shown a direct relationship between measured levels of sulfite oxidase activity and the organism's ability to withstand a sulfite challenge. Implementation of a sulfite-testing procedure confirmed the documented instability of sulfite in solution and may explain some of the conflicting results reported in the SO literature. Results of the tungstate-addition experiments confirm that Drosophila SO is a molybdoenzyme and its activity was shown to be governed by three of the four loci known to affect more than one molybdoenzyme. The ability of D. melanogaster to withstand the application of exogenous sulfites is shown to be dependent on sulfite oxidase activity.",1993,"A C Braaten, M M Bentley"
"Alterations in the activities of tyrosinase, N-acetyltransferase, and tyrosine aminotransferase in immune reactive larvae of Drosophila melanogaster",8099020,10.1016/0145-305x(93)90021-h,"The activities of three enzymes, tyrosinase (monophenol oxidase, MPO), N-acetyltransferase (NAT), and tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), were studied during eumelanotic encapsulation in host larvae of Drosophila melanogaster parasitized by the wasp, Leptopilina boulardi. At 24 h postinfection there was a tenfold increase in the MPO, whereas the activities of NAT and TAT were lower than those of nonparasitized controls. The data suggest that certain developmental processes are temporarily interrupted and alterations made in the metabolism of tyrosine to provide the metabolites necessary for a successful immune response. Two strains of D. melanogaster, R and Tyr-1, were parasitized and found to be immune reactive. The Tyr-1 strain is deficient in tyrosinase during the adult stage, but this mutation was found not to affect the immune capacity of the larvae. This is the first study to document concurrent alterations in the activities of various catecholamine-metabolizing enzymes during an immune response in an insect.",1993,"E Vass, A J Nappi, Y Carton, E Vass, A J Nappi, Y Carton"
Molecular cloning of the cDNAs for the four subunits of mouse DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex and their gene expression during cell proliferation and the cell cycle,8463324,,"The DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex purified from mouse FM3A cells is composed of four polypeptides with molecular masses of 180, 68, 54, and 46 kDa.

We have isolated the cDNAs of the four subunits by low stringency hybridization and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and determined their nucleotide sequences. The predicted amino acid sequence of the 180-kDa subunit shows 88, 38, 34, and 32% identity to those of the catalytic subunits of human, Drosophila melanogaster, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase alpha, respectively, and contains seven regions whose orders and sequences are highly conserved among viral and other eukaryotic DNA polymerases.

Cloning and analysis of expression of a ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase expressed during oogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,7683284,10.1006/dbio.1993.1125,"Using the enhancer trap approach we have searched for genes with important functions in oogenesis. We selected a line of flies with a P insertion, carrying the Escherichia coli lac Z gene, which showed beta-galactosidase expression in the nurse cell nuclei during oogenesis. Surrounding the P insertion we discovered a cluster of transcription units with enriched expression in the ovary. One of these encodes a protein with extensive sequence similarity to the human and yeast ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase. Analysis of a fusion protein including the putative ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase indicated that this protein does have the appropriate enzyme activity, and the gene was assigned the name ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase uch-D. The expression of this gene is enriched in the nurse cells and transcripts are transported to the embryo. Transcripts are abundant for the first few hours of development. The transcripts are found to be enriched on the ventral side of the oocyte and nurse cells.

Characterization of functional Sp1 transcription factor binding sites in the hepatitis B virus nucleocapsid promoter,8437225,10.1128/JVI.67.3.1472-1481.1993,"The hepatitis B virus nucleocapsid minimal promoter contains sequence elements which are similar to the Sp1 transcription factor binding site consensus sequence. The interaction of these regulatory elements with Sp1 was examined by DNase I footprinting with purified Sp1 protein and DNase I footprinting and gel retardation analysis with nuclear extracts from human cell lines and was examined functionally with transient transfection assays in human hepatoma and Drosophila melanogaster Schneider line-2 cells. DNase I footprinting identified two regions of the nucleocapsid promoter, representing three recognition elements, that bound purified Sp1. Gel retardation analysis with Huh7 nuclear extracts demonstrated that each of the three recognition elements bound the same or similar transcription factor(s) as that recognized by the Sp1 consensus sequence recognition element. The function of the nucleocapsid promoter elements was examined by transient transfection assays in D. melanogaster Schneider line-2 cells by using these binding sites cloned into a minimal promoter element. Each of these regulatory regions transactivated transcription from the minimal promoter element in response to exogenously expressed Sp1. In addition, the second Sp1 site was shown to be an essential element of the nucleocapsid promoter in human hepatoma cells. This demonstrates that the hepatitis B virus nucleocapsid promoter contains three functional Sp1 binding sites which may contribute to the level of transcription from this promoter during viral infection.",1993,"P Zhang, A K Raney, A McLachlan, P Zhang, A K Raney, A McLachlan"
Bendless alters thoracic musculature in Drosophila,8320599,10.3109/01677069309083449,"bendless- (ben-) is an X chromosome mutation in Drosophila melanogaster, known to alter patterns of connections in the CNS and thus modify behavior (Thomas and Wyman, 1984). We report that in addition to its CNS effects, ben- has pleiotropic phenotypes affecting thoracic muscle patterning, pupal mortality, and post-eclosional mobility. The tergal depressor of the trochanter (TDT) normally attaches ventrally to an apodeme on the trochanter and dorsally to the lateral scutum just posterior to the intrascutal suture. In ben- individuals, TDT may attach anywhere within the boundaries of the attachment areas for TDT and dorsoventral muscles I (DVM I) and II (DVM II). Furthermore, TDT may completely lack a dorsal attachment, although it still maintains a ventral attachment. DVMs may also attach abnormally to dorsal sites normally occupied by an adjacent DVM, or may be entirely eliminated. DVM loss occurs independently of the position or presence of TDT dorsal attachment. The cytology of ben- TDT is altered. Muscles may have fibers that are swollen and stain abnormally. Other fibers may have large, axially aligned holes. ben- flies have an increased likelihood of failing to eclose and, upon eclosion, show impaired mobility.

A1, one of the two isozymes of the prophenoloxidase, could be activated with both an endogenous activating system and artificial organic compounds including alcohols. A1 was activated within 2 min after addition of 2-propanol. The phenoloxidase activity of A1, which had been activated with 2-propanol, decreased gradually by lowering the concentration of 2-propanol taking c 60 min to attain a low level, and the activity could be re-elevated at the re-introduction of 2-propanol. Thus the reversibility of the activation of A1 in response to the change of the concentration of 2-propanol in the activating mixture could be observed. Optimum concentration of 2-propanol for the rate of activation was 50%, optimum temperature was 30 degrees C and optimum pH was 7.5. The final level of the phenoloxidase activity, which had been activated with 2-propanol, was higher than that activated with the endogenous activating system. The activated state of A1 showed properties of a tyrosinase-type phenoloxidase. The results suggested that the activation of A1 with 2-propanol is caused by the reversible conformational change of the prophenoloxidase molecule.",1993,"N Asada, T Fukumitsu, K Fujimoto, K Masuda, N Asada, T Fukumitsu, K Fujimoto, K Masuda"

Selection was successful, with mean mating times of about 5 min for the high lines, 35 min for the low lines, and 12 min for the control. Receptivity of the selection lines remained steady after 42 generations of relaxed selection, suggesting a lack of natural selection on receptivity in laboratory conditions.

Examination of DNA sequences undergoing chromatin conformation changes at a variegating breakpoint in Drosophila melanogaster,7909301,10.1007/BF00057505,"Position effect variegation in Drosophila melanogaster is associated with the inability of certain genes to be correctly expressed in a proportion of cells, giving a mosaic phenotype. The lack of expression is thought to be due to alterations in the gene's chromatin structure due to its proximity to a region of heterochromatin. Because of the difficulties involved, there is little biochemical data to support the intuitively appealing model of 'heterochromatin spreading' used to explain this phenomenon. Differences in restriction fragment length were used to distinguish DNA regions from either normal (non-position affected) or rearranged (position affected) chromosomes so as to examine possible changes in gene copy number and the effects of endogenous nucleases. DNA sequences at the breakpoint of In(1)wm4, which variegates for the white gene, were assayed under conditions where the chromatin conformation was altered using second site modifier mutations (Su(var) or En(var)). No change in the DNA sequence copy number was observed at either chromosome breakpoint, relative to wild type, when either suppressor or enhancer mutations were present. Therefore copy number change, through differential polyploidization or somatic gene loss, is not affected by Su(var) or En(var) induced changes in the chromatin conformation. Initial experiments showed a gross difference in the sensitivity of DNA to endogenous nucleases that appeared associated with Su(var) and En(var) mutations. En(var) mutation bearing samples appeared delayed in the digestion, relative to Su(var).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1993,"J Locke, J Locke"

The total dolichol content of female flies maintained at 25 degrees C increased with ageing between 0 and 64 days of adult age but the change was not significant. The total dolichol content of male flies decreased with ageing but the decrease was not significant. The relative amounts of the three different dolichol fractions in both male and female flies also failed to show any significant ageing-related change. The greatest amount of dolichol was found in the 16 isoprene unit fraction representing 67.2% of the total dolichol in male flies and 65.4% in female flies.

Developmental requirements for the ecdysoneless (ecd) locus in Drosophila melanogaster,8293578,10.1002/dvg.1020140506,"The ecdysoneless locus in Drosophila melanogaster has been defined previously by a single conditional mutation, I(3)ecd1, that causes an ecdysteroid deficit and larval death at the restrictive temperature, 29 degrees C, although the primary role of the mutation in developmental processes has been unclear. Gene dosage and complementation studies reported here for ecd1 and five nonconditional lethal alleles indicate that the ecd locus plays prezygotic and postzygotic roles essential for normal embryonic development, the successful completion of each larval molt, adult eclosion, and female fertility. The ecd locus is also required for normal macrochaete differentiation. For each observed phenotype, the severity of mutational effects was correlated with ecd mutant genotypes. In all cases, ecd1 homozygotes were least affected. Mutants heteroallelic for ecd1 and any one of four nonconditional recessive mutations were more severely affected than ecd1 homozygotes, revealing these as hypomorphic alleles. For all phenotypic effects, mutants heteroallelic for ecd1 and a dominant mutation (ecd3D) were most severely affected. These individuals died during embryogenesis at 29 degrees C and developed no macrochaetes on the dorsal thorax when transferred to 29 degrees C during the white prepupal stage. The ecd3D mutation also caused female semisterility in heterozygotes.

This transition is prevented in Drosophila larvae mutated in the ecdysone-dependent 2B5 locus, in which Sgs3 is inactive and GEBF-I, a Glue Enhancer Binding Factor, is missing. We have defined the GEBF-I binding sites in vitro and shown that mutation of these sequences abolishes the enhancer activity in vivo.

The two procedures give comparable results, showing that the D. affinis and D. pseudoobscura subgroups are monophyletic groupings that appear to have closer affinities to one another than either has to the D. obscura subgroup. We use transversion distances to estimate times of divergence, on the basis of three different estimates of the time of separation of the D. obscura species group from the D. melanogaster group.

Tissue-specific alternative splicing of the Drosophila dopa decarboxylase gene is affected by heat shock,8336700,10.1128/mcb.13.8.4549,"The Drosophila dopa decarboxylase gene, Ddc, is expressed in the hypoderm and in a small number of cells in the central nervous system (CNS). The unique Ddc primary transcript is alternatively spliced in these two tissues. We investigated whether Ddc splicing in the CNS is a general property of the CNS or a unique property of the cells that normally express Ddc by expressing the Ddc primary transcript ubiquitously under the control of an Hsp70 heat shock promoter. Under basal expression conditions, Ddc splicing shows normal tissue specificity, indicating that the regulation of Ddc splicing in the CNS is tissue specific rather than cell specific. Previous studies have shown that severe heat shock blocks mRNA splicing in cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells. Our results show that splicing of the heat shock-inducible Hsp83 transcript is very resistant to heat shock. In contrast, under either mild or severe heat shock, the splicing specificity of the heat shock-induced Ddc primary transcript is affected, leading to the accumulation of inappropriately high levels of the CNS splice form in non-CNS tissues. The chromosomal Ddc transcript is similarly affected. These results show unexpected heterogeneity in the splicing of individual mRNAs as a response to heat shock and suggest that the Ddc CNS-specific splicing pathway is the default.",1993,"J Shen, C J Beall, J Hirsh, J Shen, C J Beall, J Hirsh"
The genomic organization of HeT-A retroposons in Drosophila melanogaster,8391971,10.1007/BF00661272,"Members of the Drosophila HeT-A family of transposable elements are LINE-like retroposons that are found at telomeres and in centric heterochromatin. We recently characterized an active HeT-A element that had transposed to a broken chromosome end fewer than nine generations before it was isolated. The sequence arrangement of this element, called 9D4, most likely represents the organization of an actively transposing member of the HeT-A family. Here we assess the degree of divergence among members of the HeT-A family and test a model of telomere length maintenance based on HeT-A transposition. The region containing the single open reading frame of this element appears to be more highly conserved than the non-coding regions. The HeT-A element has been implicated in the Drosophila telomere elongation process, because frequent transpositions to chromosome ends are sufficient to counter-balance nucleotide loss due to incomplete DNA replication. The proposed elongation model and the hypothetical mechanism of HeT-A transposition predict a predominant orientation of HeT-A elements with their oligo (A) tails facing proximally at chromosome ends, as well as the existence of irregular tandem arrays of HeT-A elements at chromosome ends resulting from transposition of new HeT-A elements onto chromosome ends with existing elements. Twenty-nine different HeT-A fragments were isolated from directional libraries that were enriched in terminal DNA fragments. Sequence analyses of these fragments and comparisons with the organization of the HeT-A element, 9D4, fit these two predictions and support the model of Drosophila telomere elongation by transposition of HeT-A elements.",1993,"H Biessmann, B Kasravi, K Jakes, T Bui, K Ikenaga, J M Mason, H Biessmann, B Kasravi, K Jakes, T Bui, K Ikenaga, J M Mason"
Interspecific and intraspecific horizontal transfer of Wolbachia in Drosophila,8511587,10.1126/science.8511587,"Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in Drosophila simulans is related to infection of the germ line by a rickettsial endosymbiont (genus Wolbachia).

Transinfected strains of D. melanogaster with lower densities of Wolbachia than the naturally infected D. simulans strain did not express high levels of CI. However, transinfected D. melanogaster egg cytoplasm, transferred back into D. simulans, generated infected populations that expressed CI at levels near those of the naturally infected strain. A transinfected D. melanogaster line selected for increased levels of CI expression also displayed increased symbiont densities.

Somatic reversion of chromosomal position effects in Drosophila melanogaster,8889528,,"A transgene was inserted at several different chromosomal sites in Drosophila melanogaster, where its expression was subject to genomic position effects. Quantitative position effects and variegated and constant patterned position effects were observed. We investigated the status of the affected gene in the somatic cells where it normally functions. The FLP site-specific recombinase was used to remove the gene from the chromosome and its expression was then evaluated. We show that the FLP recombinase functions in cells that have finished their developmental program of mitoses. When FLP acts on directly repeated copies of its target site (FRT), the DNA flanked by those FRTs is excised from the chromosome as a closed circle. The extrachromosomal circle is maintained in nondividing cells, and a gene located on such a circle can be expressed. We then demonstrate that a gene subject to either variegated or constant position effect can be relieved of that effect by excision of the gene from the chromosome in cells where it would otherwise be inactive. We also observed a strong inhibition of FLP-mediated recombination for target sites located near centric heterochromatin.",1996,"K Ahmad, K G Golic, K Ahmad, K G Golic"

We used the haplotypic combinations of Thr-Gly allele with flanking markers in an attempt to identify the mechanisms involved in the evolution of the D. melanogaster Thr-Gly region and to infer the phylogenetic relationship existing among the Thr-Gly alleles. We observe evidence for both intra- and interallelic mutational mechanisms, including replication slippage, unequal crossing-over, and gene conversion.",1996,"E Rosato, A A Peixoto, A Gallippi, C P Kyriacou, R Costa, E Rosato, A A Peixoto, A Gallippi, C P Kyriacou, R Costa"
Sex-specific control of Sex-lethal is a conserved mechanism for sex determination in the genus Drosophila,8631274,,"In D. melanogaster the binary switch gene Sex-lethal (Sxl) plays a pivotal role in somatic sex determination -- when the Sxl gene is on the female pathway is followed, while the male pathway is followed when the gene is off. In the present study we have asked whether the Sxl gene is present in other species of the genus Drosophila and whether it is subject to a similar sex-specific on-off regulation. Sxl proteins were found in all of the drosophilids examined, and they display a sex-specific pattern of expression. Furthermore, characterization of the Sxl gene in the distant drosophilan relative, D. virilis, reveals that the structure and sequence organization of the gene has been well conserved and that, like melanogaster, alternative RNA processing is responsible for its sex-specific expression. Hence, this posttranscriptional on-off regulatory mechanism probably existed before the separation of the drosophilan and sophophoran subgenera and it seems likely that Sxl functions as a sex determination switch gene in most species in the Drosophila genus. Although alternative splicing appears to be responsible for the on-off regulation of the Sxl gene in D. virilis, this species is unusual in that Sxl proteins are present not only in females but also in males. The D. virilis female and male proteins appear to be identical over most of the length except for the amino-terminal approx. 25 aa which are encoded by the differentially spliced exons. In transcriptionally active polytene chromosomes, the male and female proteins bind to the same cytogenetic loci, including the sites corresponding to the D. virilis Sxl and tra genes. Hence, though the male proteins are able to interact with appropriate target pre-mRNAs, they are apparently incapable of altering the splicing pattern of these pre-mRNAs.",1996,"D Bopp, G Calhoun, J I Horabin, M Samuels, P Schedl, D Bopp, G Calhoun, J I Horabin, M Samuels, P Schedl"
Gene transfer into corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea) embryos,8796344,10.1101/gr.6.7.571,"Transposable elements with short inverted repeats at their termini have been identified in a number of diverse insect species and have proven to be useful gene delivery vectors for the transformation of Drosophila melanogaster. In this report we examine the ability of the D. melanogaster hobo element to transpose in lepidopteran species. A Trichoplusia ni (cabbage looper) and a Helicoverpa zea (corn earworm) embryonic cell line were found to be capable of supporting productive transposition of the hobo element as measured by a plasmid-based excision assay. Furthermore, hobo transposition was detected in H. zea embryos in a manner consistent with that seen for the cell line. In both cases, transposition/excision was found to be independent of vector-encoded transposase functions, indicating that endogenous genes are involved in hobo mobility. Finally, we demonstrate the stable insertion of the bacterial lacZ gene into the H. zea genome. These data demonstrate that hobo elements are capable of transgressing species boundaries and functioning in non-drosophilid cellular environments. More importantly, this represents the first description of a genetic transformation system for a lepidopteran species.",1996,"J D DeVault, K J Hughes, R A Leopold, O A Johnson, S K Narang, J D DeVault, K J Hughes, R A Leopold, O A Johnson, S K Narang"

Flies were artificially selected for differential sensitivity to the induction of bithorax phenocopies by ether vapor. The experiments demonstrated that increased sensitivity to ether correlated with a loss of expression of UBX in the third thoracic imaginal discs and that a significant proportion of the genetic variation for transcriptional stability can be attributed to polymorphism in the Ubx gene.",1996,"G Gibson, D S Hogness, G Gibson, D S Hogness"
"Identification and genetic analysis of wunen, a gene guiding Drosophila melanogaster germ cell migration",8807296,,"We describe a novel genetic locus, wunen (wun), required for guidance of germ cell migration in early Drosophila development. Loss of wun function does not abolish movement but disrupts the orientation of the motion causing the germ cells to disperse even though their normal target, the somatic gonad, is well formed. We demonstrate that the product of this gene enables a signal to pass from the soma to the germ line and propose that the function of this signal is to selectively stabilize certain cytoplasmic extensions resulting in oriented movement. To characterize this guidance factor, we have mapped wun to within 100 kb of cloned DNA.",1996,"N Zhang, J Zhang, Y Cheng, K Howard, N Zhang, J Zhang, Y Cheng, K Howard"

Analysis of the cDNA for this lectin revealed that the 14-kDa subunit consists of 163 amino acid residues and contains all residues conserved in various C-type lectins.

For high levels of transcription in the embryonic central nervous system (CNS) different modules dispersed over 3 kb have to co-operate. Combination of a core promoter with either far upstream localized enhancer elements or, alternatively, with an enhancer from the intron results in expression limited to only a few neuronal cells. Cooperation of all three modules, however, leads to high level expression in most neuronal cells of the CNS. In the intron, we identified a 6 bp core element which is essential for transcription in the CNS, as well as an 8 bp element required for maternal expression. Interestingly, both motifs are quite similar, with CAAAAT as the CNS core and CAAAAAT as the maternal enhancer core. Specific binding of proteins from nuclear extracts to the CNS-specific element could be demonstrated.

The complete deduced amino acid sequences of the mammalian and nematode homologues share with the Drosophila frizzled protein a conserved amino-terminal cysteine-rich domain and seven putative transmembrane segments. Each of the mammalian homologues is expressed in a distinctive set of tissues in the adult, and at least three are expressed during embryogenesis. As hypothesized for the Drosophila frizzled protein, the frizzled homologues are likely to act as transmembrane receptors for as yet unidentified ligands.

Cytoplasmic dynein function is essential in Drosophila melanogaster,8849893,,"The microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein has been implicated in a variety of intracellular transport processes. We previously identified and characterized the Drosophila gene Dhc64C, which encodes a cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain. To investigate the function of the cytoplasmic dynein motor, we initiated a mutational analysis of the Dhc64C dynein gene. A small deletion that removes the chromosomal region containing the heavy chain gene was used to isolate EMS-induced lethal mutations that define at least eight essential genes in the region. Germline transformation with a Dhc64C transgene rescued 16 mutant alleles in the single complementation group that identifies the dynein heavy chain gene. All 16 alleles were hemizygous lethal, which demonstrates that the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain gene Dhc64C is essential for Drosophila development. Furthermore, our failure to recover somatic clones of cells homozygous for a Dhc64C mutation indicates that cytoplasmic dynein function is required for cell viability in several Drosophila tissues.

At 96 h of age, the tracks of y larvae have 10 times as many loops as tracks of wild-type larvae, and at 120 h of age, y larvae show bending behavior about 2.5 times more frequently than do wild-type. Consequently, they do not disperse as much as wild-type larvae. Concomitant with the behavioral changes, the larvae present a defect in the morphology of large chaetae in the larval denticle belts, particularly of 2nd and 3rd instars, both with light and scanning electron microscopes.

The discussion focuses on one particular approach to developing transformation systems that relies on the use of short inverted repeat-type transposable elements analogous to that employed for Drosophila melanogaster transformation. Representatives from four families of short inverted repeat-type transposable elements have been shown to either act as non-drosophilid gene vectors or to have the ability to transpose accurately when introduced into non-host insect cells. Minos, a member of the Tcl family of elements isolated originally from D. hydei has been successfully used as a germline transformation vector in the Medfly, Ceratitis capitata. Hermes, a member of the hAT family of elements isolated originally from Musca domestica has been successfully used as a gene transformation vector in D. melanogaster and has a host range that appears to include culicids. hobo, another member of the hAT family of elements isolated from D. melanogaster also has a broad host range that includes tephritid fruitflies. mariner(Mos), a member of the mariner family of elements isolated from D. mauritiana can transpose in calliphorids.

Studies of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, have provided significant insights into the mechanisms underlying ecdysone mediated regulation of development. During the dramatic metamorphosis of Drosophila, ecdysone induces the histolysis of nearly all of the larval tissues and differentiation and morphogenesis of the structures composing the adult fly. These changes are mediated by a genetic signaling cascade that was first recognized as puffs in the giant polytene chromosomes of the salivary gland. This genetic regulatory cascade is composed of early and late genes that are intricately coordinated by changes in hormone titer. Early genes encode regulatory proteins that are involved in the proper regulation of late genes, which are thought to play a more direct role in development. The regulation and function of these genes is discussed in the context of the cell- and tissue-specific changes required for the reorganization of a larva to form an adult fly.",1996,"E H Baehrecke, E H Baehrecke"

Transposable element movements have been analyzed in complete genomes by the Southern technique. Mobilization was a rare event, with an average rate of 10(-5) per site per generation. The most active element was FB. In contrast, the retroelements gypsy and blood did not move at all. Most changes in restriction patterns were consistent with rearrangements rather than with true transposition. The euchromatic or heterochromatic location of elements was tested by comparing insertion patterns from adults and salivary glands. Certain putative rearrangements involved heterochromatic copies of the retroelements 412, copia or 297. Clustering of movement across families was observed, suggesting that movement of different families may be non-independent.

Evolutionary conservation of regulatory strategies for the sex determination factor transformer-2,9111363,10.1128/mcb.17.5.2908,"Sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster is regulated by a cascade of splicing factors which direct the sex-specific expression of gene products needed for male and female differentiation. The splicing factor TRA-2 affects sex-specific splicing of multiple pre-mRNAs involved in sexual differentiation. The tra-2 gene itself expresses a complex set of mRNAs generated through alternative processing that collectively encode three distinct protein isoforms. The expression of these isoforms differs in the soma and germ line. In the male germ line the ratio of two isoforms present is governed by autoregulation of splicing. However, the functional significance of multiple TRA-2 isoforms has remained uncertain. Here we have examined whether the structure, function, and regulation of tra-2 are conserved in Drosophila virilis, a species diverged from D. melanogaster by over 60 million years. We find that the D. virilis homolog of tra-2 produces alternatively spliced RNAs encoding a set of protein isoforms analogous to those found in D. melanogaster. When introduced into the genome of D. melanogaster, this homolog can functionally replace the endogenous tra-2 gene for both normal female sexual differentiation and spermatogenesis. Examination of alternative mRNAs produced in D. virilis testes suggests that germ line-specific autoregulation of tra-2 function is accomplished by a strategy similar to that used in D. melanogaster. The similarity in structure and function of the tra-2 genes in these divergent Drosophila species supports the idea that sexual differentiation in D. melanogaster and D. virilis is accomplished under the control of similar regulatory pathways.",1997,"D Chandler, M E McGuffin, J Piskur, J Yao, B S Baker, W Mattox"
Homology requirements for targeting heterologous sequences during P-induced gap repair in Drosophila melanogaster,9335605,,"The effect of homology on gene targeting was studied in the context of P-element-induced double-strand breaks at the white locus of Drosophila melanogaster.

A nested set of repair templates was generated that contained the 8 kilobase (kb) yellow gene embedded within varying amounts of white gene sequence. Repair with unlimited homology was also analyzed. Files were scored phenotypically for conversion of the yellow gene to the white locus. Targeting of the yellow gene was abolished when all of the 3' homology was removed. Increases in template homology up to 51 base pairs (bp) did not significantly promote targeting. Maximum conversion was observed with a construct containing 493 bp of homology, without a significant increase in frequency when homology extended to the tips of the chromosome. These results demonstrate that the homology requirements for targeting a large heterologous insertion are quite different than those for a point mutation. Furthermore, heterologous insertions strongly affect the homology requirements for the conversion of distal point mutations.

Ovulation and the suppression of mating in Drosophila melanogaster females: behavioral basis,9336085,10.1023/a:1025630602057,"Virgin females of Drosophila melanogaster that are ectopically expressing the sex-peptide gene show a high level of ovulation and are unreceptive to males. However, if they are genetically deprived of eggs, receptivity is considerably restored (Fuyama, 1995). These females, whether they have eggs or not, extrude their ovipositors toward courting males as frequently as do fertilized females. However, this rejection behavior was ineffective in suppressing male courtship. Of females with eggs, about half of them could suppress male courtship. Females lacking eggs could not suppress male courtship and continued to elicit vigorous courtship. This difference seems to account for the increased mating frequency in sterilized females. Courtship behavior by mutant males defective in olfaction or learning suggested that females are capable of repelling males by emitting a volatile pheromone(s) with an inhibitory effect on male courtship.",1997,"Y Fuyama, M Ueyama, Y Fuyama, M Ueyama"

Drosophila melanogaster deficient in protein kinase A manifests behavior-specific arrhythmia but normal clock function,9315649,10.1128/mcb.17.10.5915,"Drosophila melanogaster bearing mutations in the DCO gene, which encodes the major catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), displays arrhythmic locomotor activity strongly suggesting a role for PKA in the circadian timing system. This arrhythmicity might result from a requirement for PKA activity in photic resetting pathways, the timekeeping mechanism itself, or downstream effector pathways controlling overt behavioral rhythms. To address these possibilities, we examined the protein and mRNA products from the clock gene period (per) in PKA-deficient flies. The per protein (PER) and mRNA products undergo daily cycles in the heads and bodies of DCO mutants that are indistinguishable from those observed in control wild-type flies. These results indicate that PKA deficiencies affect the proper functioning of elements downstream of the Drosophila timekeeping mechanism. The requirement for PKA in the manifestation of rhythmic activity was preferentially greater in the absence of environmental cycles. However, PKA does not appear to play a universal role in output functions because the clock-controlled eclosion rhythm is normal in DCO mutants. Our results suggest that PKA plays a critical role in the flow of temporal information from circadian pacemaker cells to selective behaviors.",1997,"J Majercak, D Kalderon, I Edery, J Majercak, D Kalderon, I Edery"
Nucleotide sequence of a Drosophila melanogaster cDNA encoding a calnexin homologue,9218712,10.1016/s0378-1119(97)00025-5,A cDNA which encodes a calnexin (Cnx)-like protein from Drosophila melanogaster has been characterized. The deduced amino acid sequence shares several regions of homology with Cnx from other sources with two conserved motifs each repeated four times. The gene was found to be transcribed in various tissues and at all developmental stages. We have mapped the gene at chromosomal position 99A and we have also mapped the related gene coding for Drosophila calreticulin at 85E.,1997,"S Christodoulou, A E Lockyer, J M Foster, J D Hoheisel, D B Roberts, S Christodoulou, A E Lockyer, J M Foster, J D Hoheisel, D B Roberts"
A screen for fast evolving genes from Drosophila,9275195,10.1073/pnas.94.18.9746,"In an attempt to quantify the rates of protein sequence divergence in Drosophila, we have devised a screen to differentiate between slow and fast evolving genes. We find that over one-third of randomly drawn cDNAs from a Drosophila melanogaster library do not cross-hybridize with Drosophila virilis DNA, indicating that they evolve with a very high rate. To determine the evolutionary characteristics of such protein sequences, we sequenced their homologs from a more closely related species (Drosophila yakuba). The amino acid substitution rates among these cDNAs are among the fastest known and several are only about 2-fold lower than the corresponding values for silent substitutions. An analysis of within-species polymorphisms for one of these sequences reveals an exceptionally high number of polymorphic amino acid positions, indicating that the protein is not under strong negative selection. We conclude that the Drosophila genome harbors a substantial proportion of genes with a very high divergence rate.",1997,"K J Schmid, D Tautz, K J Schmid, D Tautz"
Transcriptionally repressed germ cells lack a subpopulation of phosphorylated RNA polymerase II in early embryos of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster,9187145,,"Early embryonic germ cells in C. elegans and D. melanogaster fail to express many messenger RNAs expressed in somatic cells. In contrast, we find that ribosomal RNAs are expressed in both cell types. We show that this deficiency in mRNA production correlates with the absence of a specific phosphoepitope on the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. In both C. elegans and Drosophila embryos, this phosphoepitope appears in somatic nuclei coincident with the onset of embryonic transcription, but remains absent from germ cells until these cells associate with the gut primordium during gastrulation. In contrast, a second distinct RNA polymerase II phosphoepitope is present continuously in both somatic and germ cells. The germ-line-specific factor PIE-1 is required to block mRNA production in the germ lineage of early C. elegans embryos (Seydoux, G., Mello, C. C., Pettitt, J., Wood, W. B., Priess, J. R. and Fire, A. (1996) Nature 382, 713-716). We show here that PIE-1 is also required for the germ-line-specific pattern of RNA polymerase II phosphorylation. These observations link inhibition of mRNA production in embryonic germ cells to a specific modification in the phosphorylation pattern of RNA polymerase II and suggest that repression of RNA polymerase II activity may be part of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that distinguishes germ line from soma during early embryogenesis. In addition, these studies also suggest that different phosphorylated isoforms of RNA polymerase II perform distinct functions.",1997,"G Seydoux, M A Dunn, G Seydoux, M A Dunn"
Germ line transposition of the copia retrotransposon in Drosophila melanogaster is restricted to males by tissue-specific control of copia RNA levels,9230904,10.1007/s004380050479,"Germ line transposition rates of the retrotransposon copia were directly measured in males and females of an inbred Drosophila melanogaster line, 2b3, which is highly polymorphic for copia insertion sites. The elevated germ line transposition rate of copia in this line (3-8 x 10(-3) per generation per element) is confined to males, with transposition in females being undetectable under the conditions of the experiment but at most 50-fold lower than the rate for males. To determine the molecular basis of this effect, copia RNA levels were measured in whole bodies and germ lines of male and female flies of both the unstable 2b3 line and a stable line, Oregon RC-iso, which shows normal rates of copia transposition. Both male and female 2b3 flies contain much more copia RNA than flies of the stable line. However, 2b3 male germinal tissues contain much higher levels of copia RNA than the equivalent female tissues. The highest copia expression is detected in maturing primary spermatocytes. Our data show that high rates of germ line copia transposition are restricted to males by tissue-specific control of RNA levels and suggest that transposition of copia only occurs in fly tissues containing more than a relatively high threshold level of copia RNA.",1997,"E Pasyukova, S Nuzhdin, W Li, A J Flavell, E Pasyukova, S Nuzhdin, W Li, A J Flavell"

Removing the B regions, as changing their composition or location, allowed different activators to stimulate transcription from novel initiators both in Doc and F promoters. The use of distinct initiators plausibly reflects the assembly of transcriptional complexes in which TFIID assumes alternative spatial conformations. The response of I, F and Doc promoters to the same enhancer is significantly influenced by the number, position and type of core elements present.",1997,"G Minchiotti, P P Di Nocera, G Minchiotti, P P Di Nocera"
QUANTITATIVE GENETICS OF OVARIOLE NUMBER IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER. I. SEGREGATING VARIATION AND FITNESS,28565484,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb03963.x,"The number of ovarioles of the Drosophila melanogaster ovary is a trait thought to be associated with female fecundity, and therefore is expected to be under strong natural selection. This hypothesis may be tested by examining patterns of genetic and environmental variation for ovariole number in natural populations, and by determining the association between ovariole number and fitness in isogenic lines derived from a natural population. We measured ovariole number, and competitive fitness and its components, for 48 homozygous chromosome 3 substitution lines in a standard inbred background; and body size in a sample of 15 chromosome 3 substitution lines. We found significant segregating genetic variation for ovariole number, with a broad-sense heritability (H2 ) of 0.403 and correspondingly high coefficients of genetic variation (CVC = 20.8) and residual variation (CVR = 25.3). Estimates of quantitative genetic parameters for body size (H2 = 0.191, CVG = 2.15, and CVR = 3.87) are similar to those previously reported for this trait. Although the isogenic chromosome 3 substitution lines varied significantly for components of fitness, there was no significant linear or quadratic association of ovariole number and body size with fitness. There was, however, highly significant sex ? genotype interaction for fitness among these lines. This special case of genotype ? environment interaction for fitness may contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation for fitness in natural populations.",1997,"Marta L Wayne, J Brant Hackett, Trudy F C Mackay, Marta L Wayne, J Brant Hackett, Trudy F C Mackay"

Fine tuning a molecular motor: the location of alternative domains in the Drosophila myosin head,9300050,10.1006/jmbi.1997.1160,"Myosin isoform sequence variation is likely critical for generating differences in contraction velocity and force production exhibited by the various skeletal muscles in an animal. To examine how myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform diversity could affect physiological function, we studied the locations of structural differences in the motor domains of muscle MHCs from Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila has only one muscle Mhc gene. Isoform variation is achieved by alternative splicing of a limited number of exons, clearly delineating the domains of MHC that are critical for muscle-specific functions. There are four alternative regions that contribute to the motor domain of Drosophila myosin. We used the X-ray structure of chicken skeletal S1 as a framework to examine the locations of these four regions. One lies near the ATP-binding pocket in a position where amino acid changes might be expected to modulate entry or exit of the nucleotide. Interestingly, the other three are clustered at the distal end of the molecule, surrounding the reactive cysteine SH1 and the pivot point about which the light chain-containing region swings. These observations underscore the importance of this region, distant from the site of ATP entry and the actin binding interface, as a part of the molecule where modulation of function can be achieved.",1997,"S I Bernstein, R A Milligan, S I Bernstein, R A Milligan"

Ecdysone-modulated response of Drosophila cytosolic malate dehydrogenase to juvenile hormone,9131782,,"Recently, we found that the activity of malate dehydrogenase (MDH), one of the key enzymes in the biosynthesis of lipids, is regulated in Drosophila melanogaster by juvenile hormone (JH) and JH analogues. Here we report that the response of MDH to JH, however, depends on the developmental stage of the animal in relation to its endogenous titre of ecdysteroids. During the interecdysial period of the last instar, when endogenous ecdysteroids are low, MDH rapidly responded to JH by increasing activity, while little or no response was monitored in wandering (post-feeding) larvae, i.e., after a pulse of ecdysteroids. Activity of MDH in ecd1 and su(f)ts67g, two ecdysteroid-deficient mutants of Drosophila, increased during a temperature shift to 29 degrees C as compared to wild-type controls, and was sensitive to administration of JH. In contrast, when ecd1 or su(f)ts67g larvae during restrictive conditions were fed on a 20-hydroxyecdysone diet, JH was unable to increase the activity of the MDH enzyme. However, when JH was applied prior to 20-hydroxyecdysone feeding, the activity of MDH was significantly stimulated. Two phases of MDH response to JH, dependent on ecdysteroids, could be observed. The first phase was short and independent of RNA and protein syntheses. But activation of MDH in later stages of the response was inhibited by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, indicating that MDH might be regulated by JH at the transcriptional and/or translational level.",1997,"R Farkas, J Knopp, R Farkas, J Knopp"
Conservation and divergence in the control of yolk protein genes in dipteran insects,27747424,10.1007/s004270050114,"We have investigated the conservation of regulatory elements for sex- and tissue-specific gene expression in three dipteran species, Drosophila melanogaster, Musca domestica and Calliphora erythrocephala, using the yolk protein (yp) genes. Yolk proteins of the fruitfly, medfly, housefly and blowfly are very well conserved both in their sequence and their expression in ovarian follicle cells and in fat bodies of adult females. Furthermore, yp regulation by both hormonal and nutritional factors shows similar features in all four species. To study conservation of yp regulation in dipteran insects, we tested 5' flanking regions from one Musca yp gene and one Calliphora yp gene for enhancer functions in D. melanogaster. Two fragments of 823 and 1046 bp isolated from Musca and Calliphora yp genes, respectively, are able to direct correct expression of a reporter gene in the ovarian follicle cells of transformed Drosophila at specific stages during oogenesis. Surprisingly, these enhancers do not confer sex-specific reporter gene expression in the fat body, as expression was found in both sexes of the transformed flies. None-the-less by in vitro DNA/protein interaction assays, a 284-bp DNA region from the Musca yp enhancer was able to bind the Drosophila DOUBLESEX (DSX) protein, which in D.melanogaster confers sex-specific expression of yp. We speculate that the sex-determining pathway is not directly involved in yp regulation in Musca or Calliphora adult females, but depends instead on hormonal controls to achieve sex-specific expression of yp genes in the adult.",1997,"C Tortiglione, M Bownes, C Tortiglione, M Bownes"

Activity of the Notch receptor has been observed in the patterning of ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, indicating an origin prior to the functional differentiation of these germ layers. To understand how a single receptor can participate so widely in development, we have been examining the role of specific extracellular segments of Notch. Early studies of mutations affecting widely separated EGF-like elements of Notch first raised the possibility for interaction with multiple ligands. Biochemical approaches, and exhaustive structure function studies in transgenic Drosophila are beginning to reveal how this receptor is activated, and point to a range of physical interactions with other proteins.",1997,"M W Young, C S Wesley, M W Young, C S Wesley"

This apical localization was confirmed by confocal microscopy after transfection of the cDNA coding for either full length or N-terminally truncated human syntaxin 3 in Caco-2 cells.

Particular attention was paid to a group of PDH-immunoreactive neurons at the anterior margin of the medulla-the pigment-dispersing factor-containing neurons close to the medulla (PDFMe neurons)-that seem to be involved in the control of adult circadian rhythmicity. In adults, this group consists of four to six neurons with large somata (large PDFMe neurons) and of four neurons with small somata (small PDFMe neurons). Both subgroups were usually absent in adults of behaviorally arrhythmic mutants of disconnected. In the wild type, PDH immunoreactivity was seen first in the small PDFMe neurons of 4 hour old first-instar larvae. The small PDFMe neurons were found to persist unchanged into adulthood, whereas the large ones seemed to develop halfway through metamorphosis. Beside the PDFMe neurons, three other clusters of PDH-immunoreactive neurons were stained in the developing nervous systems of Drosophila and are described in detail. Two of them were located in the brain, and the third was located in the abdominal neuromeres of the thoracic nervous system. In the mutant disconnected, the larval and the adult set of PDFMe neurons were absent. The other clusters of PDH-immunoreactive neurons seemed to develop normally.

Cloning and molecular characterization of a voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC) from Drosophila melanogaster,9271262,10.1016/s0005-2736(97)00059-x,"A full length voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC) cDNA was cloned from Drosophila melanogaster by expression library screening using an antibody against an insect VDAC protein.

These features are extraordinarily similar to those associated with chromosome misbehavior in Drosophila melanogaster females. Furthermore, these organisms also share a significant level of achiasmate chromosome nondisjunction. Here we describe in detail the processes of achiasmate chromosome segregation in Drosophila and discuss how they may be most effectively applied to our understanding of the etiology of human aneuploidy.

Introduction of a second Cibacron Blue affinity chromatography step, with gradient elution with NAD+, resulted in pure and stable enzymes. D. melanogaster ADH-SS cannot be eluted from the affinity chromatography column at a high concentration of NAD+ and required a pH gradient for its purification, preceded by a wash step with a high concentration of NAD+. Hybrid Drosophila melanogaster alcohol dehydrogenase FS has been isolated from heterozygous flies, using affinity chromatography with first elution at a high concentration NAD+, directly followed by affinity chromatography elution with a pH gradient. Incubation of equal amounts of pure homodimers of Drosophila melanogaster ADH-FF and ADH-SS, in the presence of 3 M urea at pH 8.6, for 30 min at room temperature, followed by reassociation yielded active Drosophila melanogaster ADH-FS heterodimers. No proteolytic degradation was found after incubation of purified enzyme preparations in the absence or presence of SDS, except for some degradation of ADH-SS after very long incubation times. The thermostabilities of D. melanogaster ADH-71k and ADH-SS were almost identical and were higher than those of D. melanogaster ADH-FF and D. simulans ADH. The thermostability of D. melanogaster ADH-FS was lower than those of D. melanogaster ADH-FF and ADH-SS.

We have used this system to determine whether human matrix attachment regions (MARs) can function as insulator elements in vivo. Two different human MARs, from the apolipoprotein B and alpha1-antitrypsin loci, insulated white transgene expression from position effects in Drosophila melanogaster. Both elements reduced variability in transgene expression without enhancing levels of white gene expression. In contrast, expression of white transgenes containing human DNA segments without matrix-binding activity was highly variable in Drosophila transformants.

One of the collections was reared to the F2 generation in the laboratory to compare heritability estimates from the laboratory with those from the field-laboratory comparison. Trait means indicated an increase in size under laboratory rearing. FAs increased in one collection, decreased in another collection, and showed no changes in the third collection under laboratory rearing. FAs from the collections tended to converge under laboratory conditions. Morphological traits were heritable under field conditions. However, FA was not significantly heritable for any of the individual traits or when FA was determined by combining traits. Comparisons of the two laboratory generations showed that FA heritability was low under laboratory conditions, in contrast to the morphological traits themselves. These findings suggest a very low heritability for FA in field and laboratory Drosophila.

Here we show that, in the intermediate column, the receptor tyrosine kinase DER represses expression of proneural genes, achaete and scute, and is required for the formation of neuroblasts. Most of the early function of DER is likely to be mediated by the Ras-MAP kinase signaling pathway, which is activated in the intermediate column, since a loss of a component of this pathway leads to a phenotype identical to that in DER mutants. MAP-kinase activation was also observed in the medial column where esg and proneural gene expression is unaffected by DER. We found that the homeobox gene vnd is required for the expression of esg and scute in the medial column, and show that vnd acts through the negative regulatory region of the esg enhancer that mediates the DER signal, suggesting the role of vnd is to counteract DER-dependent repression. Thus nested expression of vnd and the DER activator rhomboid is crucial to subdivide the neuroectoderm into the three dorsoventral domains.",1998,"Y Yagi, T Suzuki, S Hayashi, Y Yagi, T Suzuki, S Hayashi"
Evolution of the copia retrotransposon in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup,9729880,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026023,We report the results of a phylogenetic survey of the retrotransposon copia in the melanogaster subgroup of the Drosophila genus. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the copia 5' long terminal repeat and the adjacent untranslated leader region from representative melanogaster subgroup species. Restriction and sequence analyses of this region reveal discrete classes of copia size variants within the melanogaster subgroup. Phylogenetic comparisons of copia sequence data indicate that the size variants represent different copia subfamilies which diverged prior to their distribution in the melanogaster subgroup. Our results also suggest that copia elements have been subject to horizontal and vertical transmission during their evolution.,1998,"I K Jordan, J F McDonald, I K Jordan, J F McDonald"
[Effects of glutamic acid on heat tolerance and 70 kD proteins of Drosophila melanogaster],11939027,,"From supplement of dietary glutamic acid, the heat tolerance ability of Drosophila and the change of Hsp70(heat shock proteins) were studied. The results showed that the supplement of dietary glutamic acid could increase the survival time and the contents Hsp70 of Drosophila, in the 37 degrees C heat environment; but could not get the Hsp70 rise up when Drosophila were in 25 degrees C. Based on the findings, we could make the conclusion that supplement dietary glutamic acid could benefit the heat tolerance ability of Drosophila, and it might be related to the increase of Hsp70.",1998,"F Wang, F Zhao, J Guo, F Wang, F Zhao, J Guo"
Oxidative stress and aging reduce COX I RNA and cytochrome oxidase activity in Drosophila,9801075,10.1016/s0891-5849(98)00153-1,"Drosophila melanogaster displays an age-associated increase in oxidative damage and a decrease in mitochondrial transcripts. To determine if these changes result in energy production deficiencies, we measured the electron transport system (ETS) enzyme activity, and ATP levels with age. No statistically significant influences of age on activities of complexes I and II or citrate synthase were observed. In contrast, from 2 to 45 days post-eclosion, declines were found in complex IV cytochrome c oxidase activity (COX, 40% decline) and ATP abundance (15%), while lipid peroxidation increased 71%. We next examined flies that were either genetically or chemically oxidatively stressed to determine the effect on levels of mitochondrial-encoded cytochrome oxidase I RNA (coxI) and COX activity. A catalase null mutant line had 48% of coxI RNA compared to the wild type. In Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (cSOD) null flies, the rate of coxI RNA decline was greater than in controls. CoxI RNA also declined with increasing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment, which was reflected in reduced cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity. These results show that oxidative stress is closely associated with reductions in mitochondrial transcript levels and support the hypothesis that oxidative stress may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and aging in D. melanogaster.",1998,"S R Schwarze, R Weindruch, J M Aiken, S R Schwarze, R Weindruch, J M Aiken"
The Drosophila melanogaster-related angiotensin-I-converting enzymes Acer and Ance--distinct enzymic characteristics and alternative expression during pupal development,9839949,10.1046/j.1432-1327.1998.2570599.x,"Drosophila melanogaster express two distinct angiotensin-I-converting enzymes (ACEs) called Ance and Acer, which display a high level of primary structure similarity. We have expressed Acer in the yeast Pichia pastoris and purified the recombinant enzyme with a view to developing biochemical tools to distinguish between Acer and Ance. Purified Acer and Ance expressed in yeast were used to raise anti-Acer Ig and anti-Ance Ig that specifically cross-reacted with the respective enzyme on immunoblotting, but did not act as specific inhibitors. Acer cleaves the C-terminal dipeptides from benzoylglycyl-histidyl-leucine and [Leu5]enkephalin, and Acer and Ance are both able to act as endopeptidases, releasing the C-terminal dipeptideamide from [Leu5]enkephalinamide. However, Acer hydrolyses this substrate at a slightly faster rate than [Leu5]enkephalin, whereas Ance hydrolyses the peptide with a free C-terminus with a kcat 15-fold higher than [Leu5]enkephalinamide. In addition, Acer did not cleave angiotensin I. In contrast, Ance hydrolysed 25% of this substrate at an 8-fold lower enzyme concentration. Furthermore, Acer did not hydrolyse the synthetic substrates Phe-Ser-Pro-Arg-Leu-Gly-Arg-Arg and Phe-Ser-Pro-Arg-Leu-Gly-Lys-Arg, two partially processed putative locustamyotropin precursors, under conditions where Ance produced 82% substrate hydrolysis. Acer was inhibited by captopril, trandolaprilat and enalaprilat, with apparent Ki values in the nanomolar range, whereas lisinopril and fosinoprilat were less potent. We show that the two Drosophila ACEs are alternatively expressed in stages P1 (white puparium)-P15 (eclosion) of pupal development; Ance is expressed predominantly during stages P4-P7, whereas the ACE activity expressed during stages P9-P12 is mainly due to Acer suggesting different roles for the two enzymes during pupal development.",1998,"X Houard, T A Williams, A Michaud, P Dani, R E Isaac, A D Shirras, D Coates, P Corvol, X Houard, T A Williams, A Michaud, P Dani, R E Isaac, A D Shirras, D Coates, P Corvol"
The DNA puff gene BhC4-1 of Bradysia hygida is specifically transcribed in early prepupal salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster,9933409,10.1007/s004120050342,"The BhC4-1 gene of the sciarid Bradysia hygida is located at DNA puff C4 and is amplified and actively transcribed in the salivary gland at the end of the last larval instar. We show here that a 3.6 kb fragment from the upstream region of the BhC4-1 gene is able to drive transcription in transgenic Drosophila specifically in prepupal salivary gland in a temporally regulated manner. The mRNA is present in maximal amounts in prepupae +3 h; in prepupae +9 h the levels of BhC4-1 mRNA decline, and it is no longer detected in pupae +24 h. Taken together these results suggest that most, if not all, of the key promoter regulatory elements were included in the DNA fragments employed to transform Drosophila. Moreover, strong expression of the transgenes implies conservation of the regulatory elements involved, since Drosophila transcription factors appear to recognize B. hygida regulatory DNA sequences. Quantitative Southern blot hybridization indicates that the sequences from DNA puff C4 are not amplified at detectable levels in salivary glands of transgenic prepupae when the BhC4-1 gene is transcribed. Transcription of a DNA puff in the absence of amplification indicates that the induction of these processes involves distinct mechanisms.",1998,"N Monesi, M Jacobs-Lorena, M L PaÃ§Ã³-Larson, N Monesi, M Jacobs-Lorena, M L PaÃ§Ã³-Larson"
A novel repressor of P element transposition in Drosophila melanogaster,9674380,10.1017/s0016672397003066,"We have discovered, in an inbred line (Loua) of Drosophila melanogaster from Zaire, a third chromosome showing unusual P element repression. Repression of P element transposition by this chromosome, named Loua3, is dominant zygotic and has three unusual properties. Firstly, its repression of the gonadal dysgenesis caused by a strong P haplotype is strongly temperature-dependent, being most evident at higher rearing temperatures. Secondly, subdivision of Loua3 by recombination abolishes repression: the effect is apparently a function of the intact chromosome. Finally, Loua3 also diminishes somatic lethality when chromosomes carrying many 'ammunition' elements (Birmingham2) are exposed to the constitutive transposase source delta 2-3(99B). The chromosome has 17 P elements, none full-length, located in at least 12 dispersed positions.",1998,"R M Badge, J F Brookfield, R M Badge, J F Brookfield"
The identification and localization of a human gene with sequence similarity to Polycomblike of Drosophila melanogaster,9545646,10.1006/geno.1997.5201,"The Drosophila Polycomb group (PcG) of genes is required for the epigenetic regulation of a number of important developmental genes, including the homeotic (Hox) genes. The members of this gene family encode proteins that do not share sequence similarity, implying that each plays a unique role in this epigenetic repression mechanism. Polycomblike (Pcl) was the second PcG gene to be identified. We report here the isolation and characterization of a human cDNA, termed PHF1, which encodes a protein with significant sequence similarity to Drosophila Polycomblike (PCL). The region of similarity between PHF1 and PCL includes the two PHD fingers (C4-H-C3 motif), the region between them, and sequences C-terminal to the PHD fingers. PHF1 and PCL are 34% identical over this 258-residue region. PHF1 was mapped to 6p21.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. While several genetic diseases that are likely to result from developmental abnormalities map to this region, PHF1 is not a clear candidate gene for any of them.",1998,"M Coulson, S Robert, H J Eyre, R Saint, M Coulson, S Robert, H J Eyre, R Saint"
The effect of respiratory pattern on water loss in desiccation-resistant Drosophila melanogaster,9866880,,"We measured CO2 and H2O release from individual fruit flies from five populations of Drosophila melanogaster selected for resistance to desiccation (D flies). Our previous work found that these flies survive for an extended period in dry air, have an increase in the peak height and frequency of CO2 release, as measured by the standard error of a linear regression (SER) of CO2 release for the entire survival period, and have reduced water loss rates (VH2O) compared with their control or ancestor populations. In the present study, we examined the following respiratory characteristics: VCO2, VH2O, the SER of CO2 release and the ratio of VCO2 to VH2O in the D flies. Correlations between these characters were calculated in order to determine the effect of respiratory pattern on water loss. We found that, within the D flies, neither periodic release of CO2 nor an increased SER for CO2 release was associated with reduced water loss. In addition, an increased SER was positively correlated with both an increased water loss rate and a decreased survival time. Therefore, although selection for desiccation resistance leads to both an increased SER and a decreased rate of water loss in the D flies, the increased SER does not significantly reduce respiratory water loss.",1998,"A E Williams, T J Bradley, A E Williams, T J Bradley"
Repression of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster by combinations of telomeric P-element reporters and naturally occurring P elements,9691042,,"In Drosophila melanogaster, hybrid dysgenesis occurs in the germline of flies produced by crosses between females lacking P elements and males carrying 25-55 P elements. We have previously shown that a complete maternally inherited repression of P transposition in the germline (P cytotype) can be elicited by only two autonomous P elements located at the X chromosome telomere (cytological site 1A). We have tested whether P transgenes at 1A, unable to code for a P-repressor, may contribute to the repression of P elements. Females carrying a P-lacZ transgene at 1A [""P-lacZ(1A)""], crossed with P males, do not repress dysgenic sterility in their progeny. However, these P-lacZ(1A) insertions, maternally or paternally inherited, contribute to P-element repression when they are combined with other regulatory P elements. This combination effect is not seen when the P-lacZ transgene is located in pericentromeric heterochromatin or in euchromatin; however a P-w,ry transgene located at the 3R chromosome telomere exhibits the combination effect. The combination effect with the P-lacZ(1A) transgene is impaired by a mutant Su(var)205 allele known to impair the repression ability of the autonomous P elements at 1A. We hypothesized that the combination effect is due to modification of the chromatin structure or nuclear location of genomic P elements.",1998,"S Ronsseray, L Marin, M Lehmann, D AnxolabÃ©hÃ¨re, S Ronsseray, L Marin, M Lehmann, D AnxolabÃ©hÃ¨re"
The metabolic pathway of visual pigment chromophore formation in Drosophila melanogaster--all-trans (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal is formed from all-trans retinal via (3R)-3-hydroxyretinal in the dark,9826202,10.1046/j.1432-1327.1998.2570522.x,"Carotenoid-depleted fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, were reared on yeast/glucose medium containing lipid-depleted white corn grits and cholesterol. After rearing for more than a year, the yield of flies remained constant and the content of 3-hydroxyretinal in a head was three logarithmic units less than that of normal flies reared on medium containing yellow corn grits. When all-trans retinal was supplied as the sole source of retinoids, the flies formed and accumulated all-trans 3-hydroxyretinal in the dark. To examine the metabolic pathway to produce (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal in Drosophila, all-trans retinal was supplemented for two hours to carotenoid-depleted flies in the dark, and the subsequent changes in the composition of 3-hydroxyretinal enantiomers were analyzed using a chiral column on HPLC. The results indicated initial formation of (3R)-3-hydroxyretinal followed by isomerization into the 3S enantiomer. In another set of experiments, the membrane fraction was obtained from the head homogenate of retinoid-depleted flies and an in vitro assay of 3-hydroxyretinal formation from retinal was performed. The 3-hydroxyretinal produced was the 3R enantiomer, supporting the result obtained from the in vivo experiment whereby (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal is produced from retinal via (3R)-3-hydroxyretinal. Addition of NADPH enhanced 3-hydroxyretinal formation and the presence of carbon monoxide inhibited it, suggesting that hydroxylation at the C3 position of retinal occurred via the monooxygenase activity of cytochrome P-450.",1998,"T Seki, K Isono, K Ozaki, Y Tsukahara, Y Shibata-Katsuta, M Ito, T Irie, M Katagiri, T Seki, K Isono, K Ozaki, Y Tsukahara, Y Shibata-Katsuta, M Ito, T Irie, M Katagiri"
Genetic and hormonal control of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase activity in Drosophila melanogaster,9675555,,"The activity of Drosophila cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (MDH; EC 1.1.1.40), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of lipids, was found to be regulated by both the sesquiterpenoid juvenile hormone (JH), and the steroid hormone ecdysone. The responsiveness of MDH to JH largely depended on the developmental stage or endogenous titre of ecdysone. During the early through middle period of the last larval instar, when ecdysone levels are low, MDH responded to JH rapidly by increasing activity, while little or no response was measured in mature larvae (postfeeding stage) and fresh pupae when the endogenous pulse of ecdysone is high. Activity of MDH in ecd1 and su(f)ts67g, two ecdysone-deficient mutants of Drosophila, was increased when compared to wild type controls, and was also sensitive to administration of JH. The differences in MDH activity between ecd1 and su(f)ts67g were negligible indicating a substantial role of ecdysone in the enzyme regulation and minimal or no effect of their genetic backgrounds. Accordingly, another Drosophila mutant, ap4 which is naturally deficient in JH production, displayed significantly reduced activity of MDH in heterozygotic combination, and almost undetectable MDH activity in null homozygote adults. The ap4 phenotype was more strongly manifested in the adult stage than in larvae which showed 7-times lower requirements for JH titre. In addition, high/low sucrose diet fed to wild types or mutants affected the activity of larval MDH, but the enzyme remained sensitive to administration of JH. These results corroborate those described for mammals and provide the first evidence that Drosophila MDH might be under differential hormonal and nutritional control. These data will serve as a basis for further molecular characterization of the Drosophila MDH gene and its regulation.",1998,"R Farkas, J Knopp, R Farkas, J Knopp"

Metal ions suppress the abnormal taste behavior of the Drosophila mutant malvolio,9390942,,"A mutation in the malvolio (mvl) gene affects taste behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. The malvolio gene encodes a protein (MVL) that exhibits homology to the mammalian natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins. It is also homologous to the Smf1 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which we have recently demonstrated to function as a Mn2+/Zn2+ transporter. We proposed that the Drosophila and mammalian proteins, like the yeast SMF1 gene product, are metal-ion transporters. To test this hypothesis, malvolio mutant flies were allowed to develop, from egg to adulthood, on a medium containing elevated concentrations of metal ions. Mutant flies that were reared in the presence of 10 mmol l-1 MnCl2 or FeCl2 developed into adults with recovered taste behavior. CaCl2 or MgCl2 had no effect on the mutant's taste perception. ZnCl2 inhibited the effect of MnCl2 when both ions were supplied together. Similar suppression of the abnormal taste behavior was observed when mvl mutants were fed MnCl2 or FeCl2 only at the adult stage. Furthermore, exposure of adult mutant flies to these ions in the testing plate for only 2 h was sufficient to restore normal taste behavior. The suppression of the defective taste behavior suggests that MVL functions as a Mn2+/Fe2+ transporter and that Mn2+ and/or Fe2+ are involved in the signal transduction of taste perception in Drosophila adults.",1998,"S Orgad, H Nelson, D Segal, N Nelson, S Orgad, H Nelson, D Segal, N Nelson"
The molecular clock revisited: the rate of synonymous vs. replacement change in Drosophila,9720289,,"Rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution were investigated for 24 genes in three Drosophila species, D. pseudoobscura, D. subobscura, and D. melanogaster. D. pseudoobscura and D. subobscura, two distantly related members of the obscura clade, differ on average by 0.29 synonymous nucleotide substitutions per site. D. melanogaster differs from the two obscura species by an average of 0.81 synonymous substitutions per site. Using a method developed by Gillespie, we investigated the variance to mean ratio, or Index of Dispersion, R, of substitutions along the three species' branches to test the fundamental prediction of the neutral theory of molecular evolution, E(R) = 1. For nonsynonymous substitutions, the average R, Ra is 1.6, which is not significantly different from the neutral theory prediction. Only 5 of the 24 genes had significantly large Ra valves, and 12 of the genes had Ra estimates of less than one. In contrast, the Index of Dispersion for synonymous substitutions was significantly large for 12 of the 24 genes, with an average of R(s) = 4.4, also statistically significant. These findings contrast with results for mammals, which showed overdispersion of nonsynonymous substitutions, but not of synonymous substitutions. Weak selection acting to maintain codon bias in Drosophila, but not in mammals, may be important in explaining the high variance in the rate of synonymous substitutions in this group of organisms.",1998,"L W Zeng, J M Comeron, B Chen, M Kreitman, L W Zeng, J M Comeron, B Chen, M Kreitman"
