Nuclear chromosome dynamics in the Drosophila male germ line contribute to the nonrandom genomic distribution of retrogenes,22427708,10.1093/molbev/mss096,"The origin of RNA-based gene duplicates, that is, retrogenes, involves the reverse transcription of an mRNA derived from a parental gene to generate a cDNA copy, its insertion elsewhere in the genome, and the recruitment of regulatory sequences. Drosophila retrogenes are preferentially expressed in testis and a higher than expected number transpose to autosomal locations from the X chromosome. However, the influence of genomic context on the insertion preference of retrogenes remains poorly understood. We find that the distribution of retrogenes in the Drosophila melanogaster genome can be explained by an insertion bias toward chromosome domains containing testis-biased genes that are located at the nuclear periphery in somatic cells, but at inner positions in the male germ line. The lower fraction of these chromosome domains accessible in the male germ line on the X chromosome as compared with the autosomes also contributes to the scarcity of retrogenes on the X chromosome.",2012,"Carlos DÃ­az-Castillo, JosÃ© M Ranz, Carlos DÃ­az-Castillo, JosÃ© M Ranz"
Expression of Ixodes scapularis antifreeze glycoprotein enhances cold tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster,22428051,10.1371/journal.pone.0033447,"Drosophila melanogaster experience cold shock injury and die when exposed to low non-freezing temperatures. In this study, we generated transgenic D. melanogaster that express putative Ixodes scapularis antifreeze glycoprotein (IAFGP) and show that the presence of IAFGP increases the ability of flies to survive in the cold. Male and female adult iafgp-expressing D. melanogaster exhibited higher survival rates compared with controls when placed at non-freezing temperatures. Increased hatching rates were evident in embryos expressing IAFGP when exposed to the cold. The TUNEL assay showed that flight muscles from iafgp-expressing female adult flies exhibited less apoptotic damage upon exposure to non-freezing temperatures in comparison to control flies. Collectively, these data suggest that expression of iafgp increases cold tolerance in flies by preventing apoptosis. This study defines a molecular basis for the role of an antifreeze protein in cryoprotection of flies.",2012,"Girish Neelakanta, Andrew M Hudson, Hameeda Sultana, Lynn Cooley, Erol Fikrig"
Chronic malnutrition favours smaller critical size for metamorphosis initiation in Drosophila melanogaster,22122120,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2011.02419.x,"Critical size at which metamorphosis is initiated represents an important checkpoint in insect development. Here, we use experimental evolution in Drosophila melanogaster to test the long-standing hypothesis that larval malnutrition should favour a smaller critical size. We report that six fly populations subject to 112 generations of laboratory natural selection on an extremely poor larval food evolved an 18% smaller critical size (compared to six unselected control populations). Thus, even though critical size is not plastic with respect to nutrition, smaller critical size can evolve as an adaptation to nutritional stress. We also demonstrate that this reduction in critical size (rather than differences in growth rate) mediates a trade-off in body weight that the selected populations experience on standard food, on which they show a 15-17% smaller adult body weight. This illustrates how developmental mechanisms that control life history may shape constraints and trade-offs in life history evolution.",2012,"R K Vijendravarma, S Narasimha, T J Kawecki, R K Vijendravarma, S Narasimha, T J Kawecki"
The propensity for consuming ethanol in Drosophila requires rutabaga adenylyl cyclase expression within mushroom body neurons,22624869,10.1111/j.1601-183X.2012.00810.x,"Alcohol activates reward systems through an unknown mechanism, in some cases leading to alcohol abuse and dependence. Herein, we utilized a two-choice Capillary Feeder assay to address the neural and molecular basis for ethanol self-administration in Drosophila melanogaster. Wild-type Drosophila shows a significant preference for food containing between 5% and 15% ethanol. Preferred ethanol self-administration does not appear to be due to caloric advantage, nor due to perceptual biases, suggesting a hedonic bias for ethanol exists in Drosophila. Interestingly, rutabaga adenylyl cyclase expression within intrinsic mushroom body neurons is necessary for robust ethanol self-administration. The expression of rutabaga in mushroom bodies is also required for both appetitive and aversive olfactory associative memories, suggesting that reinforced behavior has an important role in the ethanol self-administration in Drosophila. However, rutabaga expression is required more broadly within the mushroom bodies for the preference for ethanol-containing food than for olfactory memories reinforced by sugar reward. Together these data implicate cAMP signaling and behavioral reinforcement for preferred ethanol self-administration in D. melanogaster.",2012,"S Xu, T Chan, V Shah, S Zhang, S D Pletcher, G Roman, S Xu, T Chan, V Shah, S Zhang, S D Pletcher, G Roman"
Hyperthermic overdrive: oxygen delivery does not limit thermal tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster,23438104,10.1673/031.012.10901,"The causes of thermal tolerance limits in animals are controversial. In many aquatic species, it is thought that the inability to deliver sufficient oxygen at high temperatures is more critical than impairment of molecular functions of the mitochondria. However, terrestrial insects utilize a tracheal system, and the concept of a mismatch between metabolic demand and circulatory performance might not apply to them. Using thermo-limit respirometry, it has been shown earlier in Drosophila melanogaster that CO(2) release rates at temperatures above the upper thermal limit (CT(max)) exceed the rate at CT(max). The nature of this post-CT(max), or ""post-mortal"" peak, is unknown. Either its source is increased aerobic mitochondrial respiration (hyperthermic overdrive), or an anaerobic process such as liberation of stored CO(2) from the hemolymph. The post-mortal peak of CO(2) release was found to be oxygen dependent. As the rate of CO(2) emission is a conservative indicator of rate of O(2) consumption, aerobic flux at the thermal limit is submaximal, which contradicts the theory that oxygen availability limits metabolic activity at high temperatures in insects. Consequently, the tracheal system should be capable of delivering sufficient oxygen for aerobic activity of the mitochondria at and above Ct(max).",2012,"Andreas B MÃ¶lich, Thomas D FÃ¶rster, John R B Lighton, Andreas B MÃ¶lich, Thomas D FÃ¶rster, John R B Lighton"
"Combined effects of two mild stresses (cold and hypergravity) on longevity, behavioral aging, and resistance to severe stresses in Drosophila melanogaster",22391643,10.1007/s10522-012-9377-4,"Mild stresses may have positive effects on aging, longevity and resistance to severe stresses at various ages in Drosophila melanogaster. However, no study has combined two mild stresses to know whether more positive effects would be observed than with each stress alone. Cold and hypergravity (HG) have positive effects on some traits, but negative ones can also be observed, particularly in females. This study combined in the same flies cold and HG exposure. When cold and HG had each positive or negative effects their combination had additive effects but, when only one of the pretreatments had some effect, the effect of their combination usually reflected this effect. Therefore, combining two mild stresses with positive effects on aging and longevity can be more efficient than each stress alone. However, if one of these mild stresses had negative effects and the other one positive effects, the net result of their combination could be the suppression of the positive effect of the second stress. On the whole, if the net result of the combination of two mild stresses would be negative, it would be preferable not to combine them.",2012,"Eric Le Bourg, Eric Le Bourg"
Loss of the tumor suppressor Pten promotes proliferation of Drosophila melanogaster cells in vitro and gives rise to continuous cell lines,22363644,10.1371/journal.pone.0031417,"In vivo analysis of Drosophila melanogaster has enhanced our understanding of many biological processes, notably the mechanisms of heredity and development. While in vivo analysis of mutants has been a strength of the field, analyzing fly cells in culture is valuable for cell biological, biochemical and whole genome approaches in which large numbers of homogeneous cells are required. An efficient genetic method to derive Drosophila cell lines using expression of an oncogenic form of Ras (Ras(V12)) has been developed. Mutations in tumor suppressors, which are known to cause cell hyperproliferation in vivo, could provide another method for generating Drosophila cell lines. Here we screened Drosophila tumor suppressor mutations to test if they promoted cell proliferation in vitro. We generated primary cultures and determined when patches of proliferating cells first emerged. These cells emerged on average at 37 days in wild-type cultures. Using this assay we found that a Pten mutation had a strong effect. Patches of proliferating cells appeared on average at 11 days and the cultures became confluent in about 3 weeks, which is similar to the timeframe for cultures expressing Ras(V12). Three Pten mutant cell lines were generated and these have now been cultured for between 250 and 630 cell doublings suggesting the life of the mutant cells is likely to be indefinite. We conclude that the use of Pten mutants is a powerful means to derive new Drosophila cell lines.",2012,"Steven E Justiniano, Anne Mathew, Sayan Mitra, Sathiya N Manivannan, Amanda Simcox, Steven E Justiniano, Anne Mathew, Sayan Mitra, Sathiya N Manivannan, Amanda Simcox"

A translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) method to profile actively translated mRNAs has been developed for use in a number of multicellular organisms although it has only been implemented to examine limited sets of cell- or tissue-types in these organisms. We have adapted the TRAP method for use in the versatile GAL4/UAS system of Drosophila allowing profiling of almost any tissue/cell-type with a single genetic cross. We created transgenic strains expressing a GFP-tagged ribosomal protein, RpL10A, under the control of the UAS promoter to perform cell-type specific translatome profiling. The GFP::RpL10A fusion protein incorporates efficiently into ribosomes and polysomes.

Expression profiling of attenuated mitochondrial function identifies retrograde signals in Drosophila,22908033,10.1534/g3.112.002584,"Mitochondria are able to modulate cell state and fate during normal and pathophysiologic conditions through a nuclear-mediated mechanism collectively termed as a retrograde response. Our previous studies in Drosophila melanogaster have clearly established that progress through the cell cycle is precisely regulated by the intrinsic activity of the mitochondrion by specific signaling cascades mounted by the cell. As a means to further our understanding of how mitochondrial energy status affects nuclear control of basic cell decisions, we have employed Affymetrix microarray-based transcriptional profiling of Drosophila S2 cells knocked down for the gene encoding subunit Va of the complex IV of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The profiling data identify transcriptional upregulation of glycolytic genes, and metabolic studies confirm this increase in glycolysis. The data provide a model of the shift of metabolism from a predominately oxidative state toward a predominately aerobic glycolytic state mediated through transcriptional control. The transcriptional changes alter many signaling systems, including p53, insulin, hypoxia-induced factor Î±, and conserved mitochondrial retrograde responses. This rich dataset provides many novel targets for further understanding the mechanism whereby the mitochondrion manages energy substrate disposition and directs cellular fate decisions.",2012,"William A Freije, Sudip Mandal, Utpal Banerjee, William A Freije, Sudip Mandal, Utpal Banerjee"

We performed divergent selection on replicate populations for only 14 generations, but had considerable power to differentiate alleles that evolved due to selection from those that evolved stochastically. We identified a large number of variants that changed frequency in response to selection for this simple behavior, and they are highly underrepresented on the X chromosome.

The role of glypicans in Wnt inhibitory factor-1 activity and the structural basis of Wif1's effects on Wnt and Hedgehog signaling,22383891,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002503,"Proper assignment of cellular fates relies on correct interpretation of Wnt and Hedgehog (Hh) signals. Members of the Wnt Inhibitory Factor-1 (WIF1) family are secreted modulators of these extracellular signaling pathways. Vertebrate WIF1 binds Wnts and inhibits their signaling, but its Drosophila melanogaster ortholog Shifted (Shf) binds Hh and extends the range of Hh activity in the developing D. melanogaster wing. Shf activity is thought to depend on reinforcing interactions between Hh and glypican HSPGs. Using zebrafish embryos and the heterologous system provided by D. melanogaster wing, we report on the contribution of glypican HSPGs to the Wnt-inhibiting activity of zebrafish Wif1 and on the protein domains responsible for the differences in Wif1 and Shf specificity. We show that Wif1 strengthens interactions between Wnt and glypicans, modulating the biphasic action of glypicans towards Wnt inhibition; conversely, glypicans and the glypican-binding ""EGF-like"" domains of Wif1 are required for Wif1's full Wnt-inhibiting activity. Chimeric constructs between Wif1 and Shf were used to investigate their specificities for Wnt and Hh signaling. Full Wnt inhibition required the ""WIF"" domain of Wif1, and the HSPG-binding EGF-like domains of either Wif1 or Shf. Full promotion of Hh signaling requires both the EGF-like domains of Shf and the WIF domains of either Wif1 or Shf. That the Wif1 WIF domain can increase the Hh promoting activity of Shf's EGF domains suggests it is capable of interacting with Hh. In fact, full-length Wif1 affected distribution and signaling of Hh in D. melanogaster, albeit weakly, suggesting a possible role for Wif1 as a modulator of vertebrate Hh signaling.",2012,"Andrei Avanesov, Shawn M Honeyager, Jarema Malicki, Seth S Blair, Andrei Avanesov, Shawn M Honeyager, Jarema Malicki, Seth S Blair"

L. monocytogenes infection alters energy metabolism; the flies gradually lose both of their energy stores, triglycerides and glycogen, and show decreases in both intermediate metabolites and enzyme message for the two main energy pathways, beta-oxidation and glycolysis. L. monocytogenes infection also causes enzymatic reduction in the anti-oxidant uric acid, and knocking out the enzyme uric oxidase has a complicated effect on immunity.

The role of background selection in shaping patterns of molecular evolution and variation: evidence from variability on the Drosophila X chromosome,22377629,10.1534/genetics.111.138073,"In the putatively ancestral population of Drosophila melanogaster, the ratio of silent DNA sequence diversity for X-linked loci to that for autosomal loci is approximately one, instead of the expected ""null"" value of 3/4. One possible explanation is that background selection (the hitchhiking effect of deleterious mutations) is more effective on the autosomes than on the X chromosome, because of the lack of crossing over in male Drosophila. The expected effects of background selection on neutral variability at sites in the middle of an X chromosome or an autosomal arm were calculated for different models of chromosome organization and methods of approximation, using current estimates of the deleterious mutation rate and distributions of the fitness effects of deleterious mutations. The robustness of the results to different distributions of fitness effects, dominance coefficients, mutation rates, mapping functions, and chromosome size was investigated. The predicted ratio of X-linked to autosomal variability is relatively insensitive to these variables, except for the mutation rate and map length. Provided that the deleterious mutation rate per genome is sufficiently large, it seems likely that background selection can account for the observed X to autosome ratio of variability in the ancestral population of D. melanogaster. The fact that this ratio is much less than one in D. pseudoobscura is also consistent with the model's predictions, since this species has a high rate of crossing over. The results suggest that background selection may play a major role in shaping patterns of molecular evolution and variation.",2012,"Brian Charlesworth, Brian Charlesworth"

The GMR-GAL4 driver, which expresses the yeast transcription factor GAL4 under the control of glass multiple reporter (GMR) promoter elements, has been commonly utilized to express target transgenes, specifically in the developing eye. However, we have observed abnormal wing phenotypes; this is a result of the activity of critical wing developing genes, e.g., components of the Notch or Wg pathway, that are up- or down-regulated under the control of the GMR-GAL4 driver. X-gal staining confirmed that UAS-LacZ is expressed in third-instar larva wing imaginal discs, as well as in eye discs, when driven by the GMR-GAL4 driver. Furthermore, we found that GMR-GAL4 also drives UAS-LacZ expression in other tissues, such as brain, trachea, and leg discs.

Synaptic activity in serotonergic neurons is required for air-puff stimulated flight in Drosophila melanogaster,23029511,10.1371/journal.pone.0046405,"Background:
      
    

    
      Flight is an integral component of many complex behavioral patterns in insects. The giant fiber circuit has been well studied in several insects including Drosophila. However, components of the insect flight circuit that respond to an air-puff stimulus and comprise the flight central pattern generator are poorly defined. Aminergic neurons have been implicated in locust, moth and Drosophila flight. Here we have investigated the requirement of neuronal activity in serotonergic neurons, during development and in adults, on air-puff induced flight in Drosophila.
    

    
  


        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      To target serotonergic neurons specifically, a Drosophila strain that contains regulatory regions from the TRH (Tryptophan Hydroxylase) gene linked to the yeast transcription factor GAL4 was used. By blocking synaptic transmission from serotonergic neurons with a tetanus toxin transgene or by hyperpolarisation with Kir2.1, close to 50% adults became flightless. Temporal expression of a temperature sensitive Dynamin mutant transgene (Shi(ts)) suggests that synaptic function in serotonergic neurons is required both during development and in adults. Depletion of IP(3)R in serotonergic neurons via RNAi did not affect flight. Interestingly, at all stages a partial requirement for synaptic activity in serotonergic neurons was observed. The status of serotonergic neurons was investigated in the central nervous system of larvae and adults expressing tetanus toxin. A small but significant reduction was observed in serotonergic cell number in adult second thoracic segments from flightless tetanus toxin expressing animals.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      These studies show that loss of synaptic activity in serotonergic neurons causes a flight deficit. The temporal focus of the flight deficit is during pupal development and in adults. The cause of the flight deficit is likely to be loss of neurons and reduced synaptic function. Based on the partial phenotypes, serotonergic neurons appear to be modulatory, rather than an intrinsic part of the flight circuit.",2012,"Sufia Sadaf, Serge Birman, Gaiti Hasan, Sufia Sadaf, Serge Birman, Gaiti Hasan"

Here, we investigated whether the promoter of the immediate-early gene, ie1, from the Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) could be used to drive efficient transgene expression in a wide variety of insects. We used a piggyBac-based vector with a 3xP3-DsRed transformation marker to generate a reporter construct; this construct was used to determine the expression patterns driven by the BmNPV ie1 promoter; we performed a detailed investigation of the promoter in transgene expression pattern in Drosophila melanogaster and in B. mori. Drosophila and Bombyx belong to different insect orders (Diptera and Lepidoptera, respectively); however, and to our surprise, ie1 promoter-driven expression was evident in several tissues (e.g., prothoracic gland, midgut, and tracheole) in both insects. Furthermore, in both species, the ie1 promoter drove expression of the reporter gene from a relatively early embryonic stage, and strong ubiquitous ie1 promoter-driven expression continued throughout the larval, pupal, and adult stages by surface observation. Therefore, we suggest that the ie1 promoter can be used as an efficient expression driver in a diverse range of insect species.",2012,"Mika Masumoto, Takahiro Ohde, Kunihiro Shiomi, Toshinobu Yaginuma, Teruyuki Niimi, Mika Masumoto, Takahiro Ohde, Kunihiro Shiomi, Toshinobu Yaginuma, Teruyuki Niimi"
Microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin KLP10A restricts the length of the acentrosomal meiotic spindle in Drosophila females,22865737,10.1534/genetics.112.143503,"During cell division, a bipolar array of microtubules forms the spindle through which the forces required for chromosome segregation are transmitted. Interestingly, the spindle as a whole is stable enough to support these forces even though it is composed of dynamic microtubules, which are constantly undergoing periods of growth and shrinkage. Indeed, the regulation of microtubule dynamics is essential to the integrity and function of the spindle. We show here that a member of an important class of microtubule-depolymerizing kinesins, KLP10A, is required for the proper organization of the acentrosomal meiotic spindle in Drosophila melanogaster oocytes. In the absence of KLP10A, microtubule length is not controlled, resulting in extraordinarily long and disorganized spindles. In addition, the interactions between chromosomes and spindle microtubules are disturbed and can result in the loss of contact. These results indicate that the regulation of microtubule dynamics through KLP10A plays a critical role in restricting the length and maintaining bipolarity of the acentrosomal meiotic spindle and in promoting the contacts that the chromosomes make with microtubules required for meiosis I segregation.",2012,"Sarah J Radford, Andrew M Harrison, Kim S McKim, Sarah J Radford, Andrew M Harrison, Kim S McKim"
Visualization of TGN-endosome trafficking in mammalian and Drosophila cells,22264539,10.1016/B978-0-12-391857-4.00013-6,"Mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) are known to be shuttled between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes, thereby several lysosomal hydrolases are delivered through the endocytic pathway into lysosomes. This interorganellar transport is mediated by transport intermediates, now called transport carriers. Previous studies employing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based live-cell imaging demonstrated that these transport carriers are pleiomorphic structures composed of tubular and vesicular elements. Introducing a time-axis into light microscopic observations enabled us to identify transport carriers that are derived from or targeted at a distinct organelle. In this study, we describe several methods for the observation of GFP-tagged MPRs. Photobleaching the peripheral region of a cell before a time-lapse observation allows us to monitor TGN-derived transport carriers for longer periods (more than 4min). Events of their targeting into endosomes can be visualized by dual-color imaging of both GFP-MPRs and fluorescently tagged transferrin that is internalized by cells. By using a technique of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we can analyze overall cycling kinetics of MPRs in a single cell. Transport of MPRs is regulated by several cytosolic factors like clathrin adaptors, AP1, and GGAs. The adaptors on the TGN membranes are exchanging with their cytosolic pool, which can also be analyzed by FRAP. In addition, the relationships of the MPR-containing transport carriers that left the TGN and the adaptors can be visualized by dual-color imaging. A similar system of membrane transport and its regulation is well documented in drosophila cells. As Drosophila melanogaster has only a single MPR (LERP), AP1, or GGA, it is an ideal model system for the understanding of specific functions of each cytosolic factor. To visualize these molecules in drosophila cells, however, we need to consider that multiple Golgi dots exist scattered in the cytoplasm. Thus, the Golgi dots or endosomes should be identified before live-cell imaging.",2012,"Satoshi Kametaka, Satoshi Waguri, Satoshi Kametaka, Satoshi Waguri"

Already after 15 generations, we identified a pronounced genomic response to selection, with almost 5000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP; genome-wide false discovery rates < 0.005%) deviating from neutral expectation. Importantly, the evolutionary trajectories of the selected alleles were heterogeneous, with the alleles falling into two distinct classes: (i) alleles that continuously rise in frequency; and (ii) alleles that at first increase rapidly but whose frequencies then reach a plateau. Our data thus suggest that the genomic response to selection can involve a large number of selected SNPs that show unexpectedly complex evolutionary trajectories, possibly due to nonadditive effects.",2012,"Pablo Orozco-terWengel, Martin Kapun, Viola Nolte, Robert Kofler, Thomas Flatt, Christian SchlÃ¶tterer, Pablo Orozco-terWengel, Martin Kapun, Viola Nolte, Robert Kofler, Thomas Flatt, Christian SchlÃ¶tterer"

We found that CG32744 retains conserved polyubiquitin-coding sequences across Drosophila species and is ubiquitously expressed, whereas CG11700 has accumulated numerous amino acid changes and shows a male-specific expression pattern. Null mutants of CG11700 have a higher male fecundity but shorter lifespan, whereas its overexpression decreases male fecundity. In contrast, the null mutants of the peptide-conserved CG32744 do not exhibit such phenotypes.

Drosophila Pumilio protein contains multiple autonomous repression domains that regulate mRNAs independently of Nanos and brain tumor,22064486,10.1128/MCB.06052-11,"Drosophila melanogaster Pumilio is an RNA-binding protein that potently represses specific mRNAs. In developing embryos, Pumilio regulates a key morphogen, Hunchback, in collaboration with the cofactor Nanos. To investigate repression by Pumilio and Nanos, we created cell-based assays and found that Pumilio inhibits translation and enhances mRNA decay independent of Nanos. Nanos robustly stimulates repression through interactions with the Pumilio RNA-binding domain. We programmed Pumilio to recognize a new binding site, which garners repression of new target mRNAs. We show that cofactors Brain Tumor and eIF4E Homologous Protein are not obligatory for Pumilio and Nanos activity. The conserved RNA-binding domain of Pumilio was thought to be sufficient for its function. Instead, we demonstrate that three unique domains in the N terminus of Pumilio possess the major repressive activity and can function autonomously. The N termini of insect and vertebrate Pumilio and Fem-3 binding factors (PUFs) are related, and we show that corresponding regions of human PUM1 and PUM2 have repressive activity. Other PUF proteins lack these repression domains.

This genetic locus, which we have named mustard (mtd), contains a LysM domain, often involved in carbohydrate recognition, and a TLDc domain of unknown function. More than 20 Mtd isoforms containing one or both of these conserved domains are predicted. We establish that the mutant phenotype represents a gain of function and can be replicated by increased expression of a short, nuclearly localized Mtd isoform comprised almost entirely of the TLDc domain. We show that this Mtd isoform does not block Relish cleavage or translocation into the nucleus. Lastly, we present evidence suggesting that the eclosion defect previously attributed to the Mtd locus may be the result of the unopposed action of the NF-ÎºB homolog, Relish.

We studied this rhythm in wild-type and clock mutant flies under SN in parallel with laboratory condition (LAB) to examine (1) how the rhythm differs between SN and LAB, (2) what roles the circadian clock protein PERIOD and the circadian photoreceptor CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) play in the regulation of emergence rhythm under SN, and (3) whether there is seasonality in the rhythm. Under SN, wild-type flies displayed tightly gated emergence, peaking at ""dawn"" and gradually tapering down toward the evening, with little or no emergence by night, while in LAB, flies emerged throughout the light phase of light-dark (LD) cycles. The period loss-of-function mutant (per ( 0 )) flies were arrhythmic in LAB but displayed weak rhythmic emergence under SN. Under SN, cry mutants displayed less robust rhythm with wider gates, greater variance in peak timing, and enhanced nighttime emergence compared to controls. Furthermore, flies showed seasonal variation in emergence rhythm, coupled either to light or to humidity/temperature depending on the severity of environmental conditions. These results suggest that adult emergence rhythm of Drosophila is more robust in nature, is coupled to environmental cycles, and shows seasonal variations.",2012,"Joydeep De, Vishwanath Varma, Vijay Kumar Sharma, Joydeep De, Vishwanath Varma, Vijay Kumar Sharma"
Pan-neuronal knockdown of the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) results in a reduction in sleep and longevity in Drosophila,22197814,10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.12.040,"Sleep is a unique behavioral state that is conserved between species, and sleep regulation is closely associated to metabolism and aging. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster has been used to study the molecular mechanism underlying these physiological processes. Here we show that the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) gene, known as basket (bsk) in Drosophila, functions in neurons to regulate both sleep and longevity in Drosophila. Pan-neuronal knockdown of JNK mRNA expression by RNA interference resulted in a decrease in both sleep and longevity. A heterozygous knockout of JNK showed similar effects, indicating the molecular specificity. The JNK knockdown showed a normal arousal threshold and sleep rebound, suggesting that the basic sleep mechanism was not affected. JNK is known to be involved in the insulin pathway, which regulates metabolism and longevity. A JNK knockdown in insulin-producing neurons in the pars intercerebralis had slight effects on sleep. However, knocking down JNK in the mushroom body had a significant effect on sleep. These data suggest a unique sleep regulating pathway for JNK.",2012,"Kazuhiro Takahama, Jun Tomita, Taro Ueno, Masako Yamazaki, Shoen Kume, Kazuhiko Kume, Kazuhiro Takahama, Jun Tomita, Taro Ueno, Masako Yamazaki, Shoen Kume, Kazuhiko Kume"
"Vertebrate kidney tubules elongate using a planar cell polarity-dependent, rosette-based mechanism of convergent extension",23143599,10.1038/ng.2452,"Cystic kidney diseases are a global public health burden, affecting over 12 million people. Although much is known about the genetics of kidney development and disease, the cellular mechanisms driving normal kidney tubule elongation remain unclear. Here, we used in vivo imaging to show for the first time that mediolaterally oriented cell intercalation is fundamental to vertebrate kidney morphogenesis. Unexpectedly, we found that kidney tubule elongation is driven in large part by a myosin-dependent, multicellular rosette-based mechanism, previously only described in Drosophila melanogaster. In contrast to findings in Drosophila, however, non-canonical Wnt and planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling is required to control rosette topology and orientation during vertebrate kidney tubule elongation. These data resolve long-standing questions concerning the role of PCP signaling in the developing kidney and, moreover, establish rosette-based intercalation as a deeply conserved cellular engine for epithelial morphogenesis.",2012,"Soeren S Lienkamp, Kun Liu, Courtney M Karner, Thomas J Carroll, Olaf Ronneberger, John B Wallingford, Gerd Walz, Soeren S Lienkamp, Kun Liu, Courtney M Karner, Thomas J Carroll, Olaf Ronneberger, John B Wallingford, Gerd Walz"
The genomic response to courtship song stimulation in female Drosophila melanogaster,21976688,10.1098/rspb.2011.1644,"Courtship behaviour involves a complex exchange of signals and responses. These are usually studied at the phenotypic level, and genetic or transcriptional responses to courtship are still poorly understood. Here, we examine the gene-expression changes in Drosophila melanogaster females in response to one of the key male courtship signals in mate recognition, song produced by male wing vibration. Using long oligonucleotide microarrays, we identified several genes that responded differentially to the presence or absence of acoustic courtship stimulus. These changes were modest in both the number of genes involved and fold-changes, but notably dominated by antennal signalling genes involved in olfaction as well as neuropeptides and immune response genes. Second, we compared the expression patterns of females stimulated with synthetic song typical of either conspecific or heterospecific (Drosophila simulans) males. In this case, antennal olfactory signalling and innate immunity genes were also enriched among the differentially expressed genes. We confirmed and investigated the time course of expression differences of two identified immunity genes using real-time quantitative PCR. Our results provide novel insight into specific molecular changes in females in response to courtship song stimulation. These may be involved in both signal perception and interpretation and some may anticipate molecular interactions that occur between the sexes after mating.",2012,"Elina Immonen, Michael G Ritchie, Elina Immonen, Michael G Ritchie"
Genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying the formation of the Drosophila compound eye,21932322,10.1002/dvdy.22738,"The compound eye of Drosophila melanogaster consists of individual subunits (""ommatidia""), each containing photoreceptors and support cells. These cells derive from an undifferentiated epithelium in the eye imaginal disc and their differentiation follows a highly stereotypic pattern. Sequential commitment of pluripotent cells to become specialized cells of the visual system serves as a unique model system to study basic mechanisms of tissue development. In the past years, many regulatory genes that govern the development of the compound eye have been identified and their mode of action genetically dissected. Transcription factor networks in combination with cell-cell signalling pathways regulate the development of the eye tissue in a precise temporal and spatial manner. Here, we review the recent advances on how a single-cell-layered epithelium is patterned to give rise to the compound eye. We discuss the molecular pathways controlling differentiation of individual photoreceptors, through which they acquire their functional specificity.",2012,"Maria Tsachaki, Simon G Sprecher, Maria Tsachaki, Simon G Sprecher"
Bypassing the Greatwall-Endosulfine pathway: plasticity of a pivotal cell-cycle regulatory module in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans,22649080,10.1534/genetics.112.140574,"In vertebrates, mitotic and meiotic M phase is facilitated by the kinase Greatwall (Gwl), which phosphorylates a conserved sequence in the effector Endosulfine (Endos). Phosphorylated Endos inactivates the phosphatase PP2A/B55 to stabilize M-phase-specific phosphorylations added to many proteins by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). We show here that this module functions essentially identically in Drosophila melanogaster and is necessary for proper mitotic and meiotic cell division in a wide variety of tissues. Despite the importance and evolutionary conservation of this pathway between insects and vertebrates, it can be bypassed in at least two situations. First, heterozygosity for loss-of-function mutations of twins, which encodes the Drosophila B55 protein, suppresses the effects of endos or gwl mutations. Several types of cell division occur normally in twins heterozygotes in the complete absence of Endos or the near absence of Gwl. Second, this module is nonessential in the nematode Caenorhaditis elegans. The worm genome does not contain an obvious ortholog of gwl, although it encodes a single Endos protein with a surprisingly well-conserved Gwl target site. Deletion of this site from worm Endos has no obvious effects on cell divisions involved in viability or reproduction under normal laboratory conditions. In contrast to these situations, removal of one copy of twins does not completely bypass the requirement for endos or gwl for Drosophila female fertility, although reducing twins dosage reverses the meiotic maturation defects of hypomorphic gwl mutants. These results have interesting implications for the function and evolution of the mechanisms modulating removal of CDK-directed phosphorylations.",2012,"Min-Young Kim, Elisabetta Bucciarelli, Diane G Morton, Byron C Williams, Kristina Blake-Hodek, Claudia Pellacani, Jessica R Von Stetina, Xiaoqian Hu, Maria Patrizia Somma, Daniela Drummond-Barbosa, Michael L Goldberg, Min-Young Kim, Elisabetta Bucciarelli, Diane G Morton, Byron C Williams, Kristina Blake-Hodek, Claudia Pellacani, Jessica R Von Stetina, Xiaoqian Hu, Maria Patrizia Somma, Daniela Drummond-Barbosa, Michael L Goldberg"

However, research into the pathways involved in these processes has been limited by the relatively few metrics that can be used to measure sickness and health throughout the course of infection. Here we report measurements of infection-related declines in flies' performance on two different behavioral assays. D. melanogaster are slower to recover from a chill-induced coma during infection with either Listeria monocytogenes or Streptococcus pneumoniae. L. monocytogenes infection also impacts flies' performance during a negative geotaxis assay, revealing a decline in their rate of climbing as part of their innate escape response after startle.

A novel role for lipid droplets in the organismal antibacterial response,23150794,10.7554/eLife.00003,"We previously discovered histones bound to cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs); here we show that this forms a cellular antibacterial defense system. Sequestered on droplets under normal conditions, in the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or lipoteichoic acid (LTA), histones are released from the droplets and kill bacteria efficiently in vitro. Droplet-bound histones also function in vivo: when injected into Drosophila embryos lacking droplet-bound histones, bacteria grow rapidly. In contrast, bacteria injected into embryos with droplet-bound histones die. Embryos with droplet-bound histones displayed more than a fourfold survival advantage when challenged with four different bacterial species.

A differential requirement for SUMOylation in proliferating and non-proliferating cells during Drosophila development,22745316,10.1242/dev.082974,"SUMOylation is a highly conserved post-translational modification shown to modulate target protein activity in a wide variety of cellular processes. Although the requirement for SUMO modification of specific substrates has received significant attention in vivo and in vitro, the developmental requirements for SUMOylation at the cell and tissue level remain poorly understood. Here, we show that in Drosophila melanogaster, both heterodimeric components of the SUMO E1-activating enzyme are zygotically required for mitotic progression but are dispensable for cell viability, homeostasis and DNA synthesis in non-dividing cells. Explaining the lack of more pleiotropic effects following a global block of SUMO conjugation, we further demonstrate that low levels of global substrate SUMOylation are detected in mutants lacking either or both E1 subunits. These results not only suggest that minimal SUMOylation persists in the absence of Aos1/Uba2, but also show that the process of cell division is selectively sensitive to reductions in global SUMOylation. Supporting this view, knockdown of SUMO or its E1 and E2 enzymes robustly disrupts proliferating cells in the developing eye, without any detectable effects on the development or differentiation of neighboring post-mitotic cells.",2012,"Kiriaki Kanakousaki, Matthew C Gibson, Kiriaki Kanakousaki, Matthew C Gibson"
Pharmacological modulation of histone demethylase activity by a small molecule isolated from subcritical water extracts of Sasa senanensis leaves prolongs the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster,22809229,10.1186/1472-6882-12-101,"Background:
      
    

    
      Extracts of Sasa senanensis Rehder are used in traditional Japanese medicine; however, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of their potential health benefits.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      S. senanensis leaves were extracted with subcritical water. An active small-molecule was isolated using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and identified as 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (protocatechuic aldehyde or PA). The effects of PA on the activity of histone demethylase, the Drosophila melanogaster lifespan and gene expression in Drosophila S2 cells were investigated.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      PA inhibited the activity of Jumonji domain-containing protein 2A (JMJD2A) histone demethylase in a dose-dependent manner with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 11.6 Î¼M. However, there was no effect on lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) or HDAC8. PA significantly extended the lifespan of female, but not male, Drosophila.

"Birth, death, and replacement of karyopherins in Drosophila",22160828,10.1093/molbev/msr306,"Nucleocytoplasmic transport is a broadly conserved process across eukaryotes. Despite its essential function and conserved mechanism, components of the nuclear transport apparatus have been implicated in genetic conflicts in Drosophila, especially in the male germ line. The best understood case is represented by a truncated RanGAP gene duplication that is part of the segregation distorter system in Drosophila melanogaster. Consistent with the hypothesis that the nuclear transport pathway is at the heart of mediating genetic conflicts, both nucleoporins and directionality imposing components of nuclear transport have previously been shown to evolve under positive selection. Here, we present a comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of importins (karyopherins) in Drosophila evolution. Importins are adaptor molecules that physically mediate the transport of cargo molecules and comprise the third component of the nuclear transport apparatus. We find that importins have been repeatedly gained and lost throughout various stages of Drosophila evolution, including two intriguing examples of an apparently coincident loss and gain of nonorthologous and noncanonical importin-Î±. Although there are a few signatures of episodic positive selection, genetic innovation in importin evolution is more evident in patterns of recurrent gene birth and loss specifically for function in Drosophila testes, which is consistent with their role in supporting host genomes defense against segregation distortion.",2012,"Nitin Phadnis, Emily Hsieh, Harmit S Malik, Nitin Phadnis, Emily Hsieh, Harmit S Malik"
Negative regulation of EGFR/MAPK pathway by Pumilio in Drosophila melanogaster,22514614,10.1371/journal.pone.0034016,"In Drosophila melanogaster, specification of wing vein cells and sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells, which later give rise to a bristle, requires EGFR signaling. Here, we show that Pumilio (Pum), an RNA-binding translational repressor, negatively regulates EGFR signaling in wing vein and bristle development. We observed that loss of Pum function yielded extra wing veins and additional bristles. Conversely, overexpression of Pum eliminated wing veins and bristles. Heterozygotes for Pum produced no phenotype on their own, but greatly enhanced phenotypes caused by the enhancement of EGFR signaling. Conversely, over-expression of Pum suppressed the effects of ectopic EGFR signaling. Components of the EGFR signaling pathway are encoded by mRNAs that have Nanos Response Element (NRE)-like sequences in their 3'UTRs; NREs are known to bind Pum to confer regulation in other mRNAs. We show that these NRE-like sequences bind Pum and confer repression on a luciferase reporter in heterologous cells. Taken together, our evidence suggests that Pum functions as a negative regulator of EGFR signaling by directly targeting components of the pathway in Drosophila.",2012,"Sung Yun Kim, Ji Young Kim, Sumira Malik, Wonseok Son, Ki-Sun Kwon, Changsoo Kim, Sung Yun Kim, Ji Young Kim, Sumira Malik, Wonseok Son, Ki-Sun Kwon, Changsoo Kim"

We used real-time PCR to assess whether cold exposure induces expression of Fst in 10 different life stages of D. melanogaster, and adults of seven other Drosophila species. We exposed groups of individuals to 0 Â°C (2 h), followed by 1 h recovery (22 Â°C). Frost was significantly upregulated in response to cold in eggs, third instar larvae, and 2- and 5-day-old male and female adults in D. melanogaster. Life stages in which cold did not upregulate Fst had high constitutive expression. Frost is located on the opposite strand of an intron of Diuretic hormone (DH), but cold exposure did not upregulate DH. Frost orthologues were identified in six other species within the Melanogaster group (Drosophila sechellia, Drosophila simulans, Drosophila yakuba, Drosophila erecta, Drosophila ananassae and Drosophila mauritiana). Frost orthologues were upregulated in response to cold exposure in both sexes in adults of all of these species. The predicted structure of a putative Frost consensus protein shows highly conserved tandem repeats of motifs involved in cell signalling (PEST and TRAF2), suggesting that Fst might encode an adaptor protein involved in acute stress or apoptosis signalling in vivo.",2012,"X Bing, J Zhang, Brent J Sinclair"
Incompatibility between X chromosome factor and pericentric heterochromatic region causes lethality in hybrids between Drosophila melanogaster and its sibling species,22446316,10.1534/genetics.112.139683,"The Dobzhansky-Muller model posits that postzygotic reproductive isolation results from the evolution of incompatible epistatic interactions between species: alleles that function in the genetic background of one species can cause sterility or lethality in the genetic background of another species. Progress in identifying and characterizing factors involved in postzygotic isolation in Drosophila has remained slow, mainly because Drosophila melanogaster, with all of its genetic tools, forms dead or sterile hybrids when crossed to its sister species, D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. mauritiana. To circumvent this problem, we used chromosome deletions and duplications from D. melanogaster to map two hybrid incompatibility loci in F(1) hybrids with its sister species. We mapped a recessive factor to the pericentromeric heterochromatin of the X chromosome in D. simulans and D. mauritiana, which we call heterochromatin hybrid lethal (hhl), which causes lethality in F(1) hybrid females with D. melanogaster. As F(1) hybrid males hemizygous for a D. mauritiana (or D. simulans) X chromosome are viable, the lethality of deficiency hybrid females implies that a dominant incompatible partner locus exists on the D. melanogaster X. Using small segments of the D. melanogaster X chromosome duplicated onto the Y chromosome, we mapped a dominant factor that causes hybrid lethality to a small 24-gene region of the D. melanogaster X. We provide evidence suggesting that it interacts with hhl(mau). The location of hhl is consistent with the emerging theme that hybrid incompatibilities in Drosophila involve heterochromatic regions and factors that interact with the heterochromatin.",2012,"M Victoria Cattani, Daven C Presgraves"
Sex-biased expression of microRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster,24694940,10.1098/rsob.140024,"Most animals have separate sexes. The differential expression of gene products, in particular that of gene regulators, is underlying sexual dimorphism. Analyses of sex-biased expression have focused mostly on protein-coding genes. Several lines of evidence indicate that microRNAs, a class of major gene regulators, are likely to have a significant role in sexual dimorphism. This role has not been systematically explored so far. Here, I study the sex-biased expression pattern of microRNAs in the model species Drosophila melanogaster. As with protein-coding genes, sex-biased microRNAs are associated with the reproductive function. Strikingly, contrary to protein-coding genes, male-biased microRNAs are enriched in the X chromosome, whereas female microRNAs are mostly autosomal. I propose that the chromosomal distribution is a consequence of high rates of de novo emergence, and a preference for new microRNAs to be expressed in the testis. I also suggest that demasculinization of the X chromosome may not affect microRNAs. Interestingly, female-biased microRNAs are often encoded within protein-coding genes that are also expressed in females. MicroRNAs with sex-biased expression do not preferentially target sex-biased gene transcripts. These results strongly suggest that the sex-biased expression of microRNAs is mainly a consequence of high rates of microRNA emergence in the X chromosome (male bias) or hitchhiked expression by host genes (female bias).",2014,"Antonio Marco, Antonio Marco"

Unique and shared functions of nuclear lamina LEM domain proteins in Drosophila,24700158,10.1534/genetics.114.162941,"The nuclear lamina is an extensive protein network that contributes to nuclear structure and function. LEM domain (LAP2, emerin, MAN1 domain, LEM-D) proteins are components of the nuclear lamina, identified by a shared ??5-amino-acid motif that binds Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), a chromatin-interacting protein. Drosophila melanogaster has three nuclear lamina LEM-D proteins, named Otefin (Ote), Bocksbeutel (Bocks), and dMAN1. Although these LEM-D proteins are globally expressed, loss of either Ote or dMAN1 causes tissue-specific defects in adult flies that differ from each other. The reason for such distinct tissue-restricted defects is unknown. Here, we generated null alleles of bocks, finding that loss of Bocks causes no overt adult phenotypes. Next, we defined phenotypes associated with lem-d double mutants. Although the absence of individual LEM-D proteins does not affect viability, loss of any two proteins causes lethality. Mutant phenotypes displayed by lem-d double mutants differ from baf mutants, suggesting that BAF function is retained in animals with a single nuclear lamina LEM-D protein. Interestingly, lem-d double mutants displayed distinct developmental and cellular mutant phenotypes, suggesting that Drosophila LEM-D proteins have developmental functions that are differentially shared with other LEM-D family members. This conclusion is supported by studies showing that ectopically produced LEM-D proteins have distinct capacities to rescue the tissue-specific phenotypes found in single lem-d mutants. Our findings predict that cell-specific mutant phenotypes caused by loss of LEM-D proteins reflect both the constellation of LEM-D proteins within the nuclear lamina and the capacity of functional compensation of the remaining LEM-D proteins.",2014,"Lacy J Barton, Shameika R Wilmington, Melinda J Martin, Hannah M Skopec, Kaylee E Lovander, Belinda S Pinto, Pamela K Geyer, Lacy J Barton, Shameika R Wilmington, Melinda J Martin, Hannah M Skopec, Kaylee E Lovander, Belinda S Pinto, Pamela K Geyer"
A potent and selective Sirtuin 1 inhibitor alleviates pathology in multiple animal and cell models of Huntington's disease,24436303,10.1093/hmg/ddu010,"Protein acetylation, which is central to transcriptional control as well as other cellular processes, is disrupted in Huntington's disease (HD). Treatments that restore global acetylation levels, such as inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs), are effective in suppressing HD pathology in model organisms. However, agents that selectively target the disease-relevant HDACs have not been available. SirT1 (Sir2 in Drosophila melanogaster) deacetylates histones and other proteins including transcription factors. Genetically reducing, but not eliminating, Sir2 has been shown to suppress HD pathology in model organisms. To date, small molecule inhibitors of sirtuins have exhibited low potency and unattractive pharmacological and biopharmaceutical properties. Here, we show that highly selective pharmacological inhibition of Drosophila Sir2 and mammalian SirT1 using the novel inhibitor selisistat (selisistat; 6-chloro-2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-carbazole-1-carboxamide) can suppress HD pathology caused by mutant huntingtin exon 1 fragments in Drosophila, mammalian cells and mice. We have validated Sir2 as the in vivo target of selisistat by showing that genetic elimination of Sir2 eradicates the effect of this inhibitor in Drosophila. The specificity of selisistat is shown by its effect on recombinant sirtuins in mammalian cells. Reduction of HD pathology by selisistat in Drosophila, mammalian cells and mouse models of HD suggests that this inhibitor has potential as an effective therapeutic treatment for human disease and may also serve as a tool to better understand the downstream pathways of SirT1/Sir2 that may be critical for HD.",2014,"Marianne R Smith, Adeela Syed, Tamas Lukacsovich, Judy Purcell, Brett A Barbaro, Shane A Worthge, Stephen R Wei, Giuseppe Pollio, Letizia Magnoni, Carla Scali, Luisa Massai, Davide Franceschini, Michela Camarri, Marco Gianfriddo, Enrica Diodato, Russell Thomas, Ozgun Gokce, S J Tabrizi, Andrea Caricasole, Bernard Landwehrmeyer, Liliana Menalled, Carol Murphy, Sylvie Ramboz, Ruth Luthi-Carter, Goran Westerberg, J Lawrence Marsh, Marianne R Smith, Adeela Syed, Tamas Lukacsovich, Judy Purcell, Brett A Barbaro, Shane A Worthge, Stephen R Wei, Giuseppe Pollio, Letizia Magnoni, Carla Scali, Luisa Massai, Davide Franceschini, Michela Camarri, Marco Gianfriddo, Enrica Diodato, Russell Thomas, Ozgun Gokce, S J Tabrizi, Andrea Caricasole, Bernard Landwehrmeyer, Liliana Menalled, Carol Murphy, Sylvie Ramboz, Ruth Luthi-Carter, Goran Westerberg, J Lawrence Marsh"
Interaction of light regimes and circadian clocks modulate timing of pre-adult developmental events in Drosophila,24885932,10.1186/1471-213X-14-19,"Background:
      
    

    
      Circadian clocks have been postulated to regulate development time in several species of insects including fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster. Previously we have reported that selection for faster pre-adult development reduces development time (by ~19 h or ~11%) and clock period (by ~0.5 h), suggesting a role of circadian clocks in the regulation of development time in D. melanogaster. We reasoned that these faster developing flies could serve as a model to study stage-specific interaction of circadian clocks and developmental events with the environmental light/dark (LD) conditions. We assayed the duration of three pre-adult stages in the faster developing (FD) and control (BD) populations under a variety of light regimes that are known to modulate circadian clocks and pre-adult development time of Drosophila to examine the role of circadian clocks in the timing of pre-adult developmental stages.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We find that the duration of pre-adult stages was shorter under constant light (LL) and short period light (L)/dark (D) cycles (L:D = 10:10 h; T20) compared to the standard 24 h day (L:D = 12:12 h; T24), long LD cycles (L:D = 14:14 h; T28) and constant darkness (DD). The difference in the duration of pre-adult stages between the FD and BD populations was significantly smaller under the three LD cycles and LL compared to DD, possibly due to the fact that clocks of both FD and BD flies are driven at the same pace in the three LD regimes owing to circadian entrainment, or are rendered dysfunctional under LL.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      These results suggest that interaction between light regimes and circadian clocks regulate the duration of pre-adult developmental stages in fruit flies D. melanogaster.",2014,"Pankaj Yadav, Madhumohan Thandapani, Vijay Kumar Sharma, Pankaj Yadav, Madhumohan Thandapani, Vijay Kumar Sharma"
Reported Drosophila courtship song rhythms are artifacts of data analysis,24965095,10.1186/1741-7007-12-38,"Background:
      
    

    
      In a series of landmark papers, Kyriacou, Hall, and colleagues reported that the average inter-pulse interval of Drosophila melanogaster male courtship song varies rhythmically (KH cycles), that the period gene controls this rhythm, and that evolution of the period gene determines species differences in the rhythm's frequency. Several groups failed to recover KH cycles, but this may have resulted from differences in recording chamber size.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here, using recording chambers of the same dimensions as used by Kyriacou and Hall, I found no compelling evidence for KH cycles at any frequency. By replicating the data analysis procedures employed by Kyriacou and Hall, I found that two factors--data binned into 10-second intervals and short recordings--imposed non-significant periodicity in the frequency range reported for KH cycles. Randomized data showed similar patterns.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      All of the results related to KH cycles are likely to be artifacts of binning data from short songs. Reported genotypic differences in KH cycles cannot be explained by this artifact and may have resulted from the use of small sample sizes and/or from the exclusion of samples that did not exhibit song rhythms.",2014,"David L Stern, David L Stern"

"Apocrine secretion in Drosophila salivary glands: subcellular origin, dynamics, and identification of secretory proteins",24732043,10.1371/journal.pone.0094383,"In contrast to the well defined mechanism of merocrine exocytosis, the mechanism of apocrine secretion, which was first described over 180 years ago, remains relatively uncharacterized. We identified apocrine secretory activity in the late prepupal salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster just prior to the execution of programmed cell death (PCD). The excellent genetic tools available in Drosophila provide an opportunity to dissect for the first time the molecular and mechanistic aspects of this process. A prerequisite for such an analysis is to have pivotal immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, biochemical and proteomic data that fully characterize the process. Here we present data showing that the Drosophila salivary glands release all kinds of cellular proteins by an apocrine mechanism including cytoskeletal, cytosolic, mitochondrial, nuclear and nucleolar components. Surprisingly, the apocrine release of these proteins displays a temporal pattern with the sequential release of some proteins (e.g. transcription factor BR-C, tumor suppressor p127, cytoskeletal Î²-tubulin, non-muscle myosin) earlier than others (e.g. filamentous actin, nuclear lamin, mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase). Although the apocrine release of proteins takes place just prior to the execution of an apoptotic program, the nuclear DNA is never released. Western blotting indicates that the secreted proteins remain undegraded in the lumen. Following apocrine secretion, the salivary gland cells remain quite vital, as they retain highly active transcriptional and protein synthetic activity.",2014,"Robert FarkaÅ¡, Zuzana ?atkovÃ¡, Lucia MentelovÃ¡, PÃ©ter LÃ¶w, Denisa Be?ovÃ¡-LiszekovÃ¡, Milan Be?o, MiklÃ³s Sass, Pavel ?ehulka, Helena ?ehulkovÃ¡, Otakar RaÅ¡ka, LubomÃ­r KovÃ¡?ik, Jana ?migovÃ¡, Ivan RaÅ¡ka, Bernard M Mechler, Robert FarkaÅ¡, Zuzana ?atkovÃ¡, Lucia MentelovÃ¡, PÃ©ter LÃ¶w, Denisa Be?ovÃ¡-LiszekovÃ¡, Milan Be?o, MiklÃ³s Sass, Pavel ?ehulka, Helena ?ehulkovÃ¡, Otakar RaÅ¡ka, LubomÃ­r KovÃ¡?ik, Jana ?migovÃ¡, Ivan RaÅ¡ka, Bernard M Mechler"
Molecular determinants of odorant receptor function in insects,25116610,10.1007/s12038-014-9447-7,"The olfactory system of Drosophila melanogaster provides a powerful model to study molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying function of a sensory system. In the 1970s Siddiqi and colleagues pioneered the application of genetics to olfactory research and isolated several mutant Drosophila with odorant-specific defects in olfactory behaviour, suggesting that odorants are detected differentially by the olfactory system. Since then basic principles of olfactory system function and development have emerged using Drosophila as a model. Nearly four decades later we can add computational methods to further our understanding of how specific odorants are detected by receptors. Using a comparative approach we identify two categories of short amino acid sequence motifs: ones that are conserved family-wide predominantly in the C-terminal half of most receptors, and ones that are present in receptors that detect a specific odorant, 4-methylphenol, found predominantly in the N-terminal half. The odorant-specific sequence motifs are predictors of phenol detection in Anopheles gambiae and other insects, suggesting they are likely to participate in odorant binding. Conversely, the family-wide motifs are expected to participate in shared functions across all receptors and a mutation in the most conserved motif leads to a reduction in odor response. These findings lay a foundation for investigating functional domains within odorant receptors that can lead to a molecular understanding of odor detection.",2014,"Anandasankar Ray, Wynand Goes van Naters, John R Carlson, Anandasankar Ray, Wynand Goes van Naters, John R Carlson"
Proteins involved in the degradation of cytoplasmic mRNA in the major eukaryotic model systems,25483043,10.4161/rna.34406,"The process of mRNA decay and surveillance is considered to be one of the main posttranscriptional gene expression regulation platforms in eukaryotes. The degradation of stable, protein-coding transcripts is normally initiated by removal of the poly(A) tail followed by 5'-cap hydrolysis and degradation of the remaining mRNA body by Xrn1. Alternatively, the exosome complex degrades mRNA in the 3'>5'direction. The newly discovered uridinylation-dependent pathway, which is present in many different organisms, also seems to play a role in bulk mRNA degradation. Simultaneously, to avoid the synthesis of incorrect proteins, special cellular machinery is responsible for the removal of faulty transcripts via nonsense-mediated, no-go, non-stop or non-functional 18S rRNA decay.

Behavior of aberrant chromosome configurations in Drosophila melanogaster female meiosis I,25491942,10.1534/g3.114.014316,"One essential role of the first meiotic division is to reduce chromosome number by half. Although this is normally accomplished by segregating homologous chromosomes from each other, it is possible for a genome to have one or more chromosomes that lack a homolog (such as compound chromosomes), or have chromosomes with multiple potential homologs (such as in XXY females). These configurations complete meiosis but engage in unusual segregation patterns. In Drosophila melanogaster females carrying two compound chromosomes, the compounds can accurately segregate from each other, a process known as heterologous segregation. Similarly, in XXY females, when the X chromosomes fail to cross over, they often undergo secondary nondisjunction, where both Xs segregate away from the Y. Although both of these processes have been known for decades, the orientation mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Taking advantage of the recent discovery of chromosome congression in female meiosis I, we have examined a number of different aberrant chromosome configurations. We show that these genotypes complete congression normally, with their chromosomes bioriented at metaphase I arrest at the same rates that they segregate, indicating that orientation must be established during prometaphase I before congression. We also show that monovalent chromosomes can move out on the prometaphase I spindle, but the dot 4 chromosomes appear required for this movement. Finally, we show that, similar to achiasmate chromosomes, heterologous chromosomes can be connected by chromatin threads, suggesting a mechanism for how heterochromatic homology establishes these unusual biorientation patterns.",2014,"William D Gilliland, Eileen M Colwell, Fiona M Lane, Ashley A Snouffer, William D Gilliland, Eileen M Colwell, Fiona M Lane, Ashley A Snouffer"
Complex and non-redundant signals from individual odor receptors that underlie chemotaxis behavior in Drosophila melanogaster larvae,25238759,10.1242/bio.20148573,"The rules by which odor receptors encode odors and allow behavior are still largely unexplored. Although large data sets of electrophysiological responses of receptors to odors have been generated, few hypotheses have been tested with behavioral assays. We use a data set on odor responses of Drosophila larval odor receptors coupled with chemotaxis behavioral assays to examine rules of odor coding. Using mutants of odor receptors, we have found that odor receptors with similar electrophysiological responses to odors across concentrations play non-redundant roles in odor coding at specific odor concentrations. We have also found that high affinity receptors for odors determine behavioral response thresholds, but the rules for determining peak behavioral responses are more complex. While receptor mutants typically show loss of attraction to odors, some receptor mutants result in increased attraction at specific odor concentrations. The odor receptor mutants were rescued using transgenic expression of odor receptors, validating assignment of phenotypes to the alleles. Vapor pressures alone cannot fully explain behavior in our assay. Finally, some odors that did not elicit strong electrophysiological responses are associated with behavioral phenotypes upon examination of odor receptor mutants. This result is consistent with the role of sensory neurons in lateral inhibition via local interneurons in the antennal lobe. Taken together, our results suggest a complexity of odor coding rules even in a simple olfactory sensory system.",2014,"Jeewanjot S Grewal, Christine Nguyen, Raquel Robles, Christina Cho, Karolina Kir, Nicole Fledderman, George Gacharna, Michael Wesolowski, Christie Klinger, Pedro Vallejo, Lorien Menhennett, Abhiram Nagaraj, Chineze Ebo, Garrett Peacy, Eftihia Davelis, David Kucher, Sarah Giers, Scott A Kreher, Jeewanjot S Grewal, Christine Nguyen, Raquel Robles, Christina Cho, Karolina Kir, Nicole Fledderman, George Gacharna, Michael Wesolowski, Christie Klinger, Pedro Vallejo, Lorien Menhennett, Abhiram Nagaraj, Chineze Ebo, Garrett Peacy, Eftihia Davelis, David Kucher, Sarah Giers, Scott A Kreher"

Distinct chromatin features characterize different classes of repeat sequences in Drosophila melanogaster,24498936,10.1186/1471-2164-15-105,"Background:
      
    

    
      Repeat sequences are abundant in eukaryotic genomes but many are excluded from genome assemblies. In Drosophila melanogaster classical studies of repeat content suggested variability between individuals, but they lacked the precision of modern high throughput sequencing technologies. Genome-wide profiling of chromatin features such as histone tail modifications and DNA-binding proteins relies on alignment to the reference genome and hence excludes highly repetitive sequences.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      By analyzing repeat libraries, sequence complexity and k-mer counts we determined the abundances of different D. melanogaster repeat classes in flies in two public datasets, DGRP and modENCODE. We found that larval DNA was depleted of all repeat classes relative to adult and embryonic DNA, as expected from the known depletion of repeat-rich pericentromeric regions during polytenization of larval tissues. By applying a method that is independent of alignment to the genome assembly, we found that satellite repeats associate with distinct H3 tail modifications, such as H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 for short repeats and H3K9me1 for 359 bp repeats. Short AT-rich repeats however are depleted of nucleosomes and hence all histone modifications and associated chromatin proteins.

We show that AGO3 Slicer activity is essential for piRNA amplification and that AGO3 inhibits the homotypic Aub:Aub Ping-Pong process in a Slicer-independent manner. We also find that expression of an AGO3 Slicer mutant causes ectopic accumulation of Armitage, a key component in the primary piRNA pathway, in the Drosophila melanogaster germline granules known as nuage. AGO3 also coexists and interacts with Armitage in the mitochondrial fraction.

Drosophila models for studying iron-related neurodegenerative diseases,24553869,,"In recent years, iron has been regarded as a common pathological feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA).

However, whether iron abnormalities represent a primary or secondary event still remains unknown. Due to the limitation in transgenic rodent model construction and transfection systems, the progress in unraveling the pathogenic role of different iron-related proteins in neurodegenerative diseases has been slow. Drosophila melanogaster, a simple organism which has a shorter lifespan and smaller genome with many conserved genes, and captures many features of human nervous system and neurodegeneration, may help speed up the progress. The characteristics that spatial- and temporal-specific transgenic Drosophila can be easily constructed and raised in large quantity with phenotype easily determined turn Drosophila into an excellent in vivo genetic system for screening iron-related modifiers in different neurodegenerative conditions and hence provide a better picture about the pathogenic contribution of different iron-related protein abnormalities.

"Unlike in Drosophila Meroistic Ovaries, hippo represses notch in Blattella germanica Panoistic ovaries, triggering the mitosis-endocycle switch in the follicular cells",25426635,10.1371/journal.pone.0113850,"During insect oogenesis, the follicular epithelium undergoes both cell proliferation and apoptosis, thus modulating ovarian follicle growth. The Hippo pathway is key in these processes, and has been thoroughly studied in the meroistic ovaries of Drosophila melanogaster. However, nothing is known about the role of the Hippo pathway in primitive panoistic ovaries. This work examines the mRNA expression levels of the main components of the Hippo pathway in the panoistic ovary of the basal insect species Blattella germanica, and demonstrates the function of Hippo through RNAi. In Hippo-depleted specimens, the follicular cells of the basal ovarian follicles proliferate without arresting cytokinesis; the epithelium therefore becomes bilayered, impairing ovarian follicle growth. This phenotype is accompanied by long stalks between the ovarian follicles. In D. melanogaster loss of function of Notch determines that the stalk is not developed. With this in mind, we tested whether Hippo and Notch pathways are related in B. germanica. In Notch (only)-depleted females, no stalks were formed between the ovarian follicles. Simultaneous depletion of Hippo and Notch rescued partially the stalk to wild-type. Unlike in the meroistic ovaries of D. melanogaster, in panoistic ovaries the Hippo pathway appears to regulate follicular cell proliferation by acting as a repressor of Notch, triggering the switch from mitosis to the endocycle in the follicular cells. The phylogenetically basal position of B. germanica suggests that this might be the ancestral function of Hippo in insect ovaries.",2014,"Paula Irles, Maria-Dolors Piulachs, Paula Irles, Maria-Dolors Piulachs"
Altered GPM6A/M6 dosage impairs cognition and causes phenotypes responsive to cholesterol in human and Drosophila,25224183,10.1002/humu.22697,"Glycoprotein M6A (GPM6A) is a neuronal transmembrane protein of the PLP/DM20 (proteolipid protein) family that associates with cholesterol-rich lipid rafts and promotes filopodia formation. We identified a de novo duplication of the GPM6A gene in a patient with learning disability and behavioral anomalies. Expression analysis in blood lymphocytes showed increased GPM6A levels. An increase of patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells carrying membrane protrusions supports a functional effect of this duplication. To study the consequences of GPM6A dosage alterations in an intact nervous system, we employed Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. We found that knockdown of Drosophila M6, the sole member of the PLP family in flies, in the wing, and whole organism causes malformation and lethality, respectively. These phenotypes as well as the protrusions of patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells with increased GPM6A levels can be alleviated by cholesterol supplementation. Notably, overexpression as well as loss of M6 in neurons specifically compromises long-term memory in the courtship conditioning paradigm.

Conservation and evolutionary modifications of neuroblast expression patterns in insects,24525296,10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.01.028,"One of the major questions in evolutionary developmental neurobiology is how neuronal networks have been adapted to different morphologies and behaviour during evolution. Analyses of neurogenesis in representatives of all arthropod species have revealed evolutionary modifications of various developmental mechanisms. Among others, variations can be seen in mechanisms that are associated with changes in neural progenitor identity, which in turn determines the neuronal subtype of their progeny. Comparative analyses of the molecular processes that underlie the generation of neuronal identity might therefore uncover the steps of evolutionary changes that eventually resulted in modifications in neuronal networks. Here we address this question in the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum by analyzing and comparing the development and expression profile of neural stem cells (neuroblasts) to the published neuroblast map of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We show that substantial changes in the identity of neuroblasts have occurred during insect evolution. In almost all neuroblasts the relative positions in the ventral hemi-neuromeres are conserved; however, in over half of the neuroblasts the time of formation as well as the gene expression profile has changed. The neuroblast map presented here can be used for future comparative studies on individual neuroblast lineages in D. melanogaster and T. castaneum and additional markers and information on lineages can be added. Our data suggest that evolutionary changes in the expression profile of individual neuroblasts might have contributed to the evolution of neural diversity and subsequently to changes in neuronal networks in arthropod.",2014,"Lucia Biffar, Angelika Stollewerk, Lucia Biffar, Angelika Stollewerk"

We now demonstrate synergistic interactions of spineless and CG5017 in pathways controlling oxidative stress response and long-term memory formation in Drosophila melanogaster. Oxidative stress was induced by low doses of X-ray irradiation of flies carrying hypomorphic mutation of spineless, mutation of CG5017, and their combination.

In addition, genes undergoing rapid amino acid sequence evolution driven by positive selection showed a similar proportion of essentiality with other genes, and enrichment in modules for specific developmental stages.

Unexpected role of the steroid-deficiency protein ecdysoneless in pre-mRNA splicing,24722212,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004287,"The steroid hormone ecdysone coordinates insect growth and development, directing the major postembryonic transition of forms, metamorphosis. The steroid-deficient ecdysoneless1 (ecd1) strain of Drosophila melanogaster has long served to assess the impact of ecdysone on gene regulation, morphogenesis, or reproduction. However, ecd also exerts cell-autonomous effects independently of the hormone, and mammalian Ecd homologs have been implicated in cell cycle regulation and cancer. Why the Drosophila ecd1 mutants lack ecdysone has not been resolved. Here, we show that in Drosophila cells, Ecd directly interacts with core components of the U5 snRNP spliceosomal complex, including the conserved Prp8 protein. In accord with a function in pre-mRNA splicing, Ecd and Prp8 are cell-autonomously required for survival of proliferating cells within the larval imaginal discs. In the steroidogenic prothoracic gland, loss of Ecd or Prp8 prevents splicing of a large intron from CYP307A2/spookier (spok) pre-mRNA, thus eliminating this essential ecdysone-biosynthetic enzyme and blocking the entry to metamorphosis. Human Ecd (hEcd) can substitute for its missing fly ortholog. When expressed in the Ecd-deficient prothoracic gland, hEcd re-establishes spok pre-mRNA splicing and protein expression, restoring ecdysone synthesis and normal development. Our work identifies Ecd as a novel pre-mRNA splicing factor whose function has been conserved in its human counterpart. Whether the role of mammalian Ecd in cancer involves pre-mRNA splicing remains to be discovered.",2014,"Ann-Katrin Claudius, Patrizia Romani, Tobias Lamkemeyer, Marek Jindra, Mirka Uhlirova, Ann-Katrin Claudius, Patrizia Romani, Tobias Lamkemeyer, Marek Jindra, Mirka Uhlirova"

The P-M gonadal dysgenesis characteristics and the molecular patterns of P and KP elements were analyzed. Gonadal dysgenesis tests showed a slight variation both for P activity and P susceptibility, however the results showed a predominant M' phenotype for this region. The P and KP element were also characterized by polymerase chain reaction. The molecular analyses showed that all the populations examined had the entire 1.15 kb KP element. The molecular patterns of KP elements were the same for the populations studied. No clear relationship was found between phenotype and genomic P element composition. The correlations between the level of gonadal dysgenesis percentage (as an index for P activity and P susceptibility) and several geoclimatic factors were tested, and no general effects of altitude, temperature, rainfall, or humidity were found.

Dietary intake of Curcuma longa and Emblica officinalis increases life span in Drosophila melanogaster,24967413,10.1155/2014/910290,"Intake of food and nutrition plays a major role in affecting aging process and longevity. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the ageing process are still unclear. To this respect, diet has been considered to be a determinant of ageing process. In order to better illustrate this, we used Drosophila melanogaster as a model and fed them orally with different concentrations of two commonly used Indian medicinal plant products, Curcuma longa (rhizome) and Emblica officinalis (fruit). The results revealed significant increase in life span of Drosophila flies on exposure to both the plant products, more efficiently by C. Longa than by E. officinalis. In order to understand whether the increase in lifespan was due to high-antioxidant properties of these medicinal plants, we performed enzymatic assays to assess the SOD and catalase activities in case of both treated and control Drosophila flies. Interestingly, the results support the free radical theory of aging as both these plant derivatives show high reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activities.",2014,"Shilpa Rawal, Pavneet Singh, Ayush Gupta, Sujata Mohanty, Shilpa Rawal, Pavneet Singh, Ayush Gupta, Sujata Mohanty"

We have studied the effect of two potential antitumor drugs artemisinin and curcumin in the perspective of inhibiting l(2)gl brain tumor. Efficacies of these drugs are characterized morphologically by measuring brain sizes of untreated and treated larvae on the basis of tumor inhibition and anatomically by looking at the cellular patterning via antibody staining of the third instar Drosophila larval brains. Behavioral experiments were done in form of locomotion to correlate tumor inhibition with the revival of brain function and longevity assays to assess general health span. It was observed that both drugs show antitumor properties individually and in combination when larvae were treated with these drugs. We also found evidence for reactive oxygen species-mediated action of these drugs. Both the drugs when treated individually or together show better median life span and locomotory response. Although the efficacies of various treatments varied, overall, the positive effects of artemisinin and curcumin demonstrate a potential applicability of these drugs against brain tumor in higher organisms.

Fruiting bodies of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum increase spore transport by Drosophila,24884856,10.1186/1471-2148-14-105,"Background:
      
    

    
      Many microbial phenotypes are the product of cooperative interactions among cells, but their putative fitness benefits are often not well understood. In the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, unicellular amoebae aggregate when starved and form multicellular fruiting bodies in which stress-resistant spores are held aloft by dead stalk cells. Fruiting bodies are thought to be adaptations for dispersing spores to new feeding sites, but this has not been directly tested. Here we experimentally test whether fruiting bodies increase the rate at which spores are acquired by passing invertebrates.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Drosophila melanogaster accumulate spores on their surfaces more quickly when exposed to intact fruiting bodies than when exposed to fruiting bodies physically disrupted to dislodge spore masses from stalks. Flies also ingest and excrete spores that still express a red fluorescent protein marker.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Multicellular fruiting bodies created by D. discoideum increase the likelihood that invertebrates acquire spores that can then be transported to new feeding sites. These results thus support the long-hypothesized dispersal benefits of altruism in a model system for microbial cooperation.",2014,"Jeff Smith, David C Queller, Joan E Strassmann, Jeff Smith, David C Queller, Joan E Strassmann"
Lack of response to artificial selection on developmental stability of partial wing shape components in Drosophila melanogaster,24744255,10.1007/s10709-014-9765-6,"Developmental stability, the ability of organisms to buffer their developmental processes against developmental noise is often evaluated with fluctuating asymmetry (FA). Natural genetic variation in FA has been investigated using Drosophila wings as a model system and the recent estimation of the heritability of wing shape FA was as large as 20%. Because natural genetic variation in wing shape FA was found to localize in a partial component of the wings, heritable variation in specific parts of the wings might be responsible for FA estimation based on the whole wing shape. In this study, we quantified the shape of three partial components of the wings, and estimated the heritability of the wing shape FA based on artificial selections. As a result, FA values for the partial wing shape components did not respond to artificial selections and the heritability scores estimated were very small. These results indicate that natural additive genetic variation in FA of partial wing components was very small compared with that in a complex wing trait.",2014,"Masahiro Tsujino, Kazuo H Takahashi, Masahiro Tsujino, Kazuo H Takahashi"
Genetic dissection of the Drosophila melanogaster female head transcriptome reveals widespread allelic heterogeneity,24810915,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004322,"Modern genetic mapping is plagued by the ""missing heritability"" problem, which refers to the discordance between the estimated heritabilities of quantitative traits and the variance accounted for by mapped causative variants. One major potential explanation for the missing heritability is allelic heterogeneity, in which there are multiple causative variants at each causative gene with only a fraction having been identified. The majority of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) implicitly assume that a single SNP can explain all the variance for a causative locus. However, if allelic heterogeneity is prevalent, a substantial amount of genetic variance will remain unexplained. In this paper, we take a haplotype-based mapping approach and quantify the number of alleles segregating at each locus using a large set of 7922 eQTL contributing to regulatory variation in the Drosophila melanogaster female head. Not only does this study provide a comprehensive eQTL map for a major community genetic resource, the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource, but it also provides a direct test of the allelic heterogeneity hypothesis. We find that 95% of cis-eQTLs and 78% of trans-eQTLs are due to multiple alleles, demonstrating that allelic heterogeneity is widespread in Drosophila eQTL. Allelic heterogeneity likely contributes significantly to the missing heritability problem common in GWAS studies.",2014,"Elizabeth G King, Brian J Sanderson, Casey L McNeil, Anthony D Long, Stuart J Macdonald, Elizabeth G King, Brian J Sanderson, Casey L McNeil, Anthony D Long, Stuart J Macdonald"
Affinity-based isolation of tagged nuclei from Drosophila tissues for gene expression analysis,24686501,10.3791/51418,"Drosophila melanogaster embryonic and larval tissues often contain a highly heterogeneous mixture of cell types, which can complicate the analysis of gene expression in these tissues. Thus, to analyze cell-specific gene expression profiles from Drosophila tissues, it may be necessary to isolate specific cell types with high purity and at sufficient yields for downstream applications such as transcriptional profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation. However, the irregular cellular morphology in tissues such as the central nervous system, coupled with the rare population of specific cell types in these tissues, can pose challenges for traditional methods of cell isolation such as laser microdissection and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Here, an alternative approach to characterizing cell-specific gene expression profiles using affinity-based isolation of tagged nuclei, rather than whole cells, is described. Nuclei in the specific cell type of interest are genetically labeled with a nuclear envelope-localized EGFP tag using the Gal4/UAS binary expression system. These EGFP-tagged nuclei can be isolated using antibodies against GFP that are coupled to magnetic beads. The approach described in this protocol enables consistent isolation of nuclei from specific cell types in the Drosophila larval central nervous system at high purity and at sufficient levels for expression analysis, even when these cell types comprise less than 2% of the total cell population in the tissue. This approach can be used to isolate nuclei from a wide variety of Drosophila embryonic and larval cell types using specific Gal4 drivers, and may be useful for isolating nuclei from cell types that are not suitable for FACS or laser microdissection.",2014,"Jingqun Ma, Vikki Marie Weake, Jingqun Ma, Vikki Marie Weake"
The ecology of sexual conflict: ecologically dependent parallel evolution of male harm and female resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,24215269,10.1111/ele.12222,"The prevalence of sexual conflict in nature, along with the potentially stochastic nature of the resulting coevolutionary trajectories, makes it an important driver of phenotypic divergence and speciation that can operate even in the absence of environmental differences. The majority of empirical work investigating sexual conflict's role in population divergence/speciation has therefore been done in uniform environments and any role of ecology has largely been ignored. However, theory suggests that natural selection can constrain phenotypes influenced by sexual conflict. We use replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster adapted to alternative environments to test how ecology influences the evolution of male effects on female longevity. The extent to which males reduce female longevity, as well as female resistance to such harm, both evolved in association with adaptation to the different environments. Our results demonstrate that ecology plays a central role in shaping patterns of population divergence in traits under sexual conflict.",2014,"Devin Arbuthnott, Emily M Dutton, Aneil F Agrawal, Howard D Rundle, Devin Arbuthnott, Emily M Dutton, Aneil F Agrawal, Howard D Rundle"
Developmental variation of the SUUR protein binding correlates with gene regulation and specific chromatin types in D. melanogaster,24292500,10.1007/s00412-013-0445-6,"Eukaryotic genomes are organized in large chromatin domains that maintain proper gene activity in the cell. These domains may be permissive or repressive to the transcription of underlying genes. Based on its protein makeup, chromatin in Drosophila cell culture has been recently categorized into five color-coded states. Suppressor of Under-Replication (SUUR) protein was found to be the major component present in all three repressive chromatin states named BLACK, BLUE, and GREEN and to be depleted from the active YELLOW and RED chromatin types. Here, we addressed the question of developmental dynamics of SUUR binding as a marker of repressed chromatin types. We established genomewide SUUR binding profiles in larval salivary gland, brain, and embryos using DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) technique, performed their pairwise comparisons and comparisons with the published data from Drosophila Kc cells. SUUR binding pattern was found to vary between the samples. Increase in SUUR binding predominantly correlated with local gene repression suggesting heterochromatin formation. Reduction in SUUR binding often coincided with activation of tissue-specific genes probably reflecting the transition to permissive chromatin state and increase in accessibility to specific transcription factors. SUUR binding plasticity accompanied by the regulation of the underlying genes was mainly observed in BLACK, BLUE, and RED chromatin types. Our results provide novel insight into the developmental dynamics of repressive chromatin and reveal a link to the chromatin-guided regulation of gene expression.",2014,"Daniil A Maksimov, Dmitry E Koryakov, Stepan N Belyakin, Daniil A Maksimov, Dmitry E Koryakov, Stepan N Belyakin"
Disruption of the protein kinase N gene of drosophila melanogaster results in the recessive delorean allele (pkndln) with a negative impact on wing morphogenesis,24531729,10.1534/g3.114.010579,"We describe the delorean mutation of the Drosophila melanogaster protein kinase N gene (pkn(dln)) with defects in wing morphology. Flies homozygous for the recessive pkn(dln) allele have a composite wing phenotype that exhibits changes in relative position and shape of the wing blade as well as loss of specific vein and bristle structures. The pkn(dln) allele is the result of a P-element insertion in the first intron of the pkn locus, and the delorean wing phenotype is contingent upon the interaction of insertion-bearing alleles in trans. The presence of the insertion results in production of a novel transcript that initiates from within the 3' end of the P-element. The delorean-specific transcript is predicted to produce a wild-type PKN protein. The delorean phenotype is not the result of a reduction in pkn expression, as it could not be recreated using a variety of wing-specific drivers of pkn-RNAi expression. Rather, it is the presence of the delorean-specific transcript that correlates with the mutant phenotype. We consider the delorean wing phenotype to be due to a pairing-dependent, recessive mutation that behaves as a dosage-sensitive, gain of function. Our analysis of genetic interactions with basket and nemo reflects an involvement of pkn and Jun-terminal kinase signaling in common processes during wing differentiation and places PKN as a potential effector of Rho1's involvement in the Jun-terminal kinase pathway. The delorean phenotype, with its associated defects in wing morphology, provides evidence of a role for PKN in adult morphogenetic processes.",2014,"Georgette L Sass, Bruce D Ostrow, Georgette L Sass, Bruce D Ostrow"
Epigenomic communication systems in humans and honey bees: from molecules to behavior,20594964,10.1016/j.yhbeh.2010.05.016,"A 2010 Nature editorial entitled ""Time for the Epigenome"" trumpets the appearance of the International Human Epigenome Consortium and likens it to Biology's equivalent of the Large Hadron Collider. It strongly endorses the viewpoint that selective modifications of ""marks"" on DNA and histones constitute the crucial codes of life, a proposition which is hotly contested (Ptashne et al., in 2010). This proposition reflects the current mindset that DNA and histone modifications are the prime movers in gene regulation during evolution. This claim is perplexing, since the well characterized organisms, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, lack methylated DNA ""marks"" and the DNA methytransferase enzymology. Despite their complete absence, D. melanogaster nevertheless has extensive gene regulatory networks which drive sophisticated development, gastrulation, migration of germ cells and yield a nervous system with significant neural attributes. In stark contrast, the honey bee Apis mellifera deploys its human-type DNA methyltransferase enzymology to ""mark"" its DNA and it too has sophisticated development. What roles therefore is DNA methylation playing in different animals? The honey bee brings a fresh perspective to this question. Its combinatorial chemistry of pheromones, tergal and cuticular exudates provide an exquisite communication system between thousands of individuals. The development of queen and worker is strictly controlled by differential feeding of royal jelly and their adult behaviors are accompanied by epigenomic changes. Their interfaces with different ""environments"" are extensive, allowing an evaluation of the roles of epigenomes in behavior in a natural environment, in the space of a few weeks, and at requisite levels of experimental rigor.",2011,"George L Gabor Miklos, Ryszard Maleszka, George L Gabor Miklos, Ryszard Maleszka"
Segregating variation in the polycomb group gene cramped alters the effect of temperature on multiple traits,21283785,10.1371/journal.pgen.1001280,"The phenotype produced by a given genotype can be strongly modulated by environmental conditions. Therefore, natural populations continuously adapt to environment heterogeneity to maintain optimal phenotypes.

In particular, crm modulates the effect of temperature on a genomic region encoding Hedgehog and Wingless signaling effectors. crm affects this region through both constitutive heterochromatin and Polycomb silencing. Furthermore, we show that crm European and African natural variants shift the reaction norms of plastic traits.

Taste-independent detection of the caloric content of sugar in Drosophila,21709242,10.1073/pnas.1017096108,"Feeding behavior is influenced primarily by two factors: nutritional needs and food palatability. However, the role of food deprivation and metabolic needs in the selection of appropriate food is poorly understood. Here, we show that the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, selects calorie-rich foods following prolonged food deprivation in the absence of taste-receptor signaling. Flies mutant for the sugar receptors Gr5a and Gr64a cannot detect the taste of sugar, but still consumed sugar over plain agar after 15 h of starvation. Similarly, pox-neuro mutants that are insensitive to the taste of sugar preferentially consumed sugar over plain agar upon starvation. Moreover, when given a choice between metabolizable sugar (sucrose or D-glucose) and nonmetabolizable (zero-calorie) sugar (sucralose or L-glucose), starved Gr5a; Gr64a double mutants preferred metabolizable sugars. These findings suggest the existence of a taste-independent metabolic sensor that functions in food selection. The preference for calorie-rich food correlates with a decrease in the two main hemolymph sugars, trehalose and glucose, and in glycogen stores, indicating that this sensor is triggered when the internal energy sources are depleted. Thus, the need to replenish depleted energy stores during periods of starvation may be met through the activity of a taste-independent metabolic sensing pathway.",2011,"Monica Dus, SooHong Min, Alex C Keene, Ga Young Lee, Greg S B Suh, Monica Dus, SooHong Min, Alex C Keene, Ga Young Lee, Greg S B Suh"
A novel subfamily of mitochondrial dicarboxylate carriers from Drosophila melanogaster: biochemical and computational studies,21130726,10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.11.013,"The dicarboxylate carrier is an important member of the mitochondrial carrier family, which catalyzes an electroneutral exchange across the inner mitochondrial membrane of dicarboxylates for inorganic phosphate and certain sulfur-containing compounds. Screening of the Drosophila melanogaster genome revealed the presence of a mitochondrial carrier subfamily constituted by four potential homologs of mammalian and yeast mitochondrial dicarboxylate carriers designated as DmDic1p, DmDic2p, DmDic3p, and DmDic4p. In this paper, we report that DmDIC1 is broadly expressed at comparable levels in all development stages investigated whereas DmDIC3 and DmDIC4 are expressed only in the pupal stage, no transcripts are detectable for DmDIC2. All expressed proteins are localized in mitochondria. The transport activity of DmDic1-3-4 proteins has been investigated by reconstitution of recombinant purified protein into liposomes. DmDic1p is a typical dicarboxylate carrier showing similar substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity as mammalian and yeast mitochondrial dicarboxylate carriers. DmDic3p seems to be an atypical dicarboxylate carrier being able to transport only inorganic phosphate and certain sulfur-containing compounds. No transport activity was observed for DmDic4p.

To ask whether genetic variation for pattern formation is suppressed in this system, artificial selection for divergent egg size was used to challenge the scaling of even-skipped (eve) pattern formation in mitotic cycle 14 (stage 5) embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. Three-dimensional confocal imaging revealed shifts in the allometry of eve pair-rule stripes along both anterior?posterior (A?P) and dorsoventral (D?V) axes as a correlated response to egg size selection, indicating the availability of genetic variation for this buffered trait. Environmental perturbation was not required for the manifestation of this variation. The number of nuclei at the cellular blastoderm stage also changed in response to selection, with large-egg selected lines having more than 1000 additional nuclei relative to small-egg lines. This increase in nuclear number in larger eggs does not scale with egg size, however, as nuclear density is inversely correlated with egg length. Nuclear density varies along the A?P axis but does not correlate with the shift in eve stripe allometry between the selection treatments.

We observed a one-to-one similarity in subunit composition with their mammalian counterparts, with the exception of LPT (lost plant homeodomains [PHDs] of Trr), which copurifies with the Trr complex. LPT is a previously uncharacterized protein that is homologous to the multiple PHD fingers found in the N-terminal regions of mammalian MLL3/4 but not Drosophila Trr, indicating that Trr and LPT constitute a split gene of an MLL3/4 ancestor. Our study demonstrates that all three complexes in Drosophila are H3K4 methyltransferases; however, dSet1/COMPASS is the major monoubiquitination-dependent H3K4 di- and trimethylase in Drosophila.

It is possible to obtain electrophysiological recordings from all stages of Drosophila. Exposure of the intact Drosophila CNS is a prerequisite for such electrophysiological recordings. The dissection procedure described here can be applied to both late-stage embryos (stage 16 onward) and larvae. Because of their size, third-instar larvae are more difficult to flatten using this method and, if recording from this stage, the reader might consider using insect pins for the dissection or isolating the CNS using an alternative method.

Modulation of catalytic activity in multi-domain protein tyrosine phosphatases,21931847,10.1371/journal.pone.0024766,"Signaling mechanisms involving protein tyrosine phosphatases govern several cellular and developmental processes. These enzymes are regulated by several mechanisms which include variation in the catalytic turnover rate based on redox stimuli, subcellular localization or protein-protein interactions. In the case of Receptor Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases (RPTPs) containing two PTP domains, phosphatase activity is localized in their membrane-proximal (D1) domains, while the membrane-distal (D2) domain is believed to play a modulatory role. Here we report our analysis of the influence of the D2 domain on the catalytic activity and substrate specificity of the D1 domain using two Drosophila melanogaster RPTPs as a model system. Biochemical studies reveal contrasting roles for the D2 domain of Drosophila Leukocyte antigen Related (DLAR) and Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase on Drosophila chromosome band 99A (PTP99A). While D2 lowers the catalytic activity of the D1 domain in DLAR, the D2 domain of PTP99A leads to an increase in the catalytic activity of its D1 domain. Substrate specificity, on the other hand, is cumulative, whereby the individual specificities of the D1 and D2 domains contribute to the substrate specificity of these two-domain enzymes. Molecular dynamics simulations on structural models of DLAR and PTP99A reveal a conformational rationale for the experimental observations. These studies reveal that concerted structural changes mediate inter-domain communication resulting in either inhibitory or activating effects of the membrane distal PTP domain on the catalytic activity of the membrane proximal PTP domain.",2011,"Lalima L Madan, S Veeranna, Khader Shameer, Chilamakuri C S Reddy, R Sowdhamini, B Gopal, Lalima L Madan, S Veeranna, Khader Shameer, Chilamakuri C S Reddy, R Sowdhamini, B Gopal"

      The BLM DNA helicase plays a vital role in maintaining genome stability. Mutations in BLM cause Bloom syndrome, a rare disorder associated with cancer predisposition and premature aging. Humans and mice with blm mutations have increased frequencies of spontaneous mutagenesis, but the molecular basis of this increase is not well understood. In addition, the effect of aging on spontaneous mutagenesis in blm mutants has not been characterized. To address this, we used a lacZ reporter system in wild-type and several mutant strains of Drosophila melanogaster to analyze mechanisms of mutagenesis throughout their lifespan.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Our data show that Drosophila lacking BLM have an elevated frequency of spontaneous genome rearrangements that increases with age. Although in normal flies most genome rearrangements occur through DNA ligase 4-dependent classical end joining, most rearrangements that accumulate during aging in blm mutants do not require DNA ligase 4, suggesting the influence of an alternative end-joining mechanism. Adult blm mutants also display reduced lifespan and ligase 4-independent enhanced tumorigenesis in mitotically active tissues.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      These results suggest that Drosophila BLM suppresses error-prone alternative end-joining repair of DNA double-strand breaks that can result in genome instability and tumor formation during aging. In addition, since loss of BLM significantly affects lifespan and tumorigenesis, the data provide a link between error-prone end joining, genome rearrangements, and tumor formation in a model metazoan.",2011,"Ana Maria Garcia, Robert N Salomon, Alice Witsell, Justine Liepkalns, R Brent Calder, Moonsook Lee, Martha Lundell, Jan Vijg, Mitch McVey, Ana Maria Garcia, Robert N Salomon, Alice Witsell, Justine Liepkalns, R Brent Calder, Moonsook Lee, Martha Lundell, Jan Vijg, Mitch McVey"
"Pan-neuronal knockdown of calcineurin reduces sleep in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster",21917797,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5860-10.2011,"Sleep is a unique physiological state, which is behaviorally defined, and is broadly conserved across species from mammals to invertebrates such as insects. Because of the experimental accessibility provided by various novel animal models including the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, there have been significant advances in the understanding of sleep. Although the physiological functions of sleep have not been fully elucidated, accumulating evidence indicates that sleep is necessary to maintain the plasticity of neuronal circuits and, hence, is essential in learning and memory. Calcineurin (Cn) is a heterodimeric phosphatase composed of CnA and CnB subunits and known to function in memory consolidation in the mammalian brain, but its neurological functions in the fruit fly are largely unknown. Here, we show that Cn is an important regulator of sleep in Drosophila. A pan-neuronal RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Cn expression resulted in sleep loss, whereas misexpression of the constitutively active form of a CnA protein led to increased sleep. Furthermore, CnA knockdown also impaired the retention of aversive olfactory memory. These results indicate a role for Cn and calcium-dependent signal transduction in sleep and memory regulation and may bring insight into the relationship between them.",2011,"Jun Tomita, Madoka Mitsuyoshi, Taro Ueno, Yoshinori Aso, Hiromu Tanimoto, Yasuhiro Nakai, Toshiro Aigaki, Shoen Kume, Kazuhiko Kume, Jun Tomita, Madoka Mitsuyoshi, Taro Ueno, Yoshinori Aso, Hiromu Tanimoto, Yasuhiro Nakai, Toshiro Aigaki, Shoen Kume, Kazuhiko Kume"
Sulfurous gases as biological messengers and toxins: comparative genetics of their metabolism in model organisms,22131987,10.1155/2011/394970,"Gasotransmitters are biologically produced gaseous signalling molecules. As gases with potent biological activities, they are toxic as air pollutants, and the sulfurous compounds are used as fumigants. Most investigations focus on medical aspects of gasotransmitter biology rather than toxicity toward invertebrate pests of agriculture. In fact, the pathways for the metabolism of sulfur containing gases in lower organisms have not yet been described. To address this deficit, we use protein sequences from Homo sapiens to query Genbank for homologous proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In C. elegans, we find genes for all mammalian pathways for synthesis and catabolism of the three sulfur containing gasotransmitters, H(2)S, SO(2) and COS. The genes for H(2)S synthesis have actually increased in number in C. elegans. Interestingly, D. melanogaster and Arthropoda in general, lack a gene for 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase, an enzym for H(2)S synthesis under reducing conditions.",2011,"Neal D Mathew, David I Schlipalius, Paul R Ebert, Neal D Mathew, David I Schlipalius, Paul R Ebert"

In this paper, the wds gene was isolated and characterized from the Chinese oak silkworm, Antheraea pernyi (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae). The obtained 1733 bp cDNA sequence contains an open reading frame of 1041 bp encoding a polypeptide of 346 amino acids, with 85% sequence identity to that from D. melanogaster. RT-PCR analysis showed that the wds gene was transcribed during four developmental stages and in all the tissues tested, consistent with the result observed in Bombyx mori based on EST resources and genome-wide microarray information. The mRNA expression level of the A. pernyi wds gene was not significantly down- or up- regulated under temperature stress compared to the control, indicating that it may be not involved in temperature stress tolerance. In search of database, the wds protein homologues were found in various kinds of eukaryotes, including fungi, plants, invertebrates and vertebrates, with 50-93% amino acid sequence identities between them, suggesting that they are highly conserved during the evolution of eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis based on the wds protein homologue sequences clearly separated the known fungi, plants, invertebrates and vertebrates, consistent with the topology tree on the classical systematics, suggesting the potential value of wds protein in eukaryotic phylogenetic inference.

Drosophila histone locus bodies form by hierarchical recruitment of components,21576393,10.1083/jcb.201012077,"Nuclear bodies are protein- and RNA-containing structures that participate in a wide range of processes critical to genome function. Molecular self-organization is thought to drive nuclear body formation, but whether this occurs stochastically or via an ordered, hierarchical process is not fully understood. We addressed this question using RNAi and proteomic approaches in Drosophila melanogaster to identify and characterize novel components of the histone locus body (HLB), a nuclear body involved in the expression of replication-dependent histone genes. We identified the transcription elongation factor suppressor of Ty 6 (Spt6) and a homologue of mammalian nuclear protein of the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated locus that is encoded by the homeotic gene multisex combs (mxc) as novel HLB components. By combining genetic manipulation in both cell culture and embryos with cytological observations of Mxc, Spt6, and the known HLB components, FLICE-associated huge protein, Mute, U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, and MPM-2 phosphoepitope, we demonstrated sequential recruitment and hierarchical dependency for localization of factors to HLBs during development, suggesting that ordered assembly can play a role in nuclear body formation.",2011,"Anne E White, Brandon D Burch, Xiao-Cui Yang, Pamela Y Gasdaska, Zbigniew Dominski, William F Marzluff, Robert J Duronio, Anne E White, Brandon D Burch, Xiao-Cui Yang, Pamela Y Gasdaska, Zbigniew Dominski, William F Marzluff, Robert J Duronio"
Genetic evidence for a protective role of the peritrophic matrix against intestinal bacterial infection in Drosophila melanogaster,21896728,10.1073/pnas.1105994108,"The peritrophic matrix (PM) forms a layer composed of chitin and glycoproteins that lines the insect intestinal lumen. This physical barrier plays a role analogous to that of mucous secretions of the vertebrate digestive tract and is thought to protect the midgut epithelium from abrasive food particles and microbes. Almost nothing is known about PM functions in Drosophila, and its function as an immune barrier has never been addressed by a genetic approach. Here we show that the Drosocrystallin (Dcy) protein, a putative component of the eye lens of Drosophila, contributes to adult PM formation. A loss-of-function mutation in the dcy gene results in a reduction of PM width and an increase of its permeability. Upon bacterial ingestion a higher level of expression of antibacterial peptides was observed in dcy mutants, pointing to an influence of this matrix on bacteria sensing by the Imd immune pathway. Moreover, dcy-deficient flies show an increased susceptibility to oral infections with the entomopathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas entomophila and Serratia marcescens. Dcy mutant flies also succumb faster than wild type upon ingestion of a P. entomophila toxic extract. We show that this lethality is due in part to an increased deleterious action of Monalysin, a pore-forming toxin produced by P. entomophila. Collectively, our analysis of the dcy immune phenotype indicates that the PM plays an important role in Drosophila host defense against enteric pathogens, preventing the damaging action of pore-forming toxins on intestinal cells.",2011,"Takayuki Kuraishi, Olivier Binggeli, Onya Opota, Nicolas Buchon, Bruno Lemaitre, Takayuki Kuraishi, Olivier Binggeli, Onya Opota, Nicolas Buchon, Bruno Lemaitre"
Genomic differentiation between temperate and tropical Australian populations of Drosophila melanogaster,21059887,10.1534/genetics.110.123059,"Determining the genetic basis of environmental adaptation is a central problem of evolutionary biology.

A good example of this approach is the decades-long investigation of selection acting along latitudinal clines in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we use next-generation genome sequencing to reexamine the well-studied Australian D. melanogaster cline. We find evidence for extensive differentiation between temperate and tropical populations, with regulatory regions and unannotated regions showing particularly high levels of differentiation. Although the physical genomic scale of geographic differentiation is small--on the order of gene sized--we observed several larger highly differentiated regions. The region spanned by the cosmopolitan inversion polymorphism In(3R)P shows higher levels of differentiation, consistent with the major difference in allele frequencies of Standard and In(3R)P karyotypes in temperate vs. tropical Australian populations.

In order to analyze where the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of the mammalian serotonin transporter (dSERT) is expressed in the nervous system, a dSERT antibody serum was used. Ectopic expression studies and loss of function analysis revealed that the dSERT antibody serum specifically recognizes dSERT. It was shown that in the embryonic nervous system dSERT is expressed in a subset of Engrailed-positive neurons. In the larval brain, dSERT is exclusively expressed in serotonergic neurons, all of which express dSERT. dSERT-positive neurons surround almost all brain neuropiles. In the mushroom body of the adult brain, extrinsic serotonergic neurons expressing dSERT engulf the mushroom body lobes. These neurons show regional differences in dSERT and serotonin expression. At the presynaptic terminals, serotonin release is sterically linked to serotonin reuptake. In contrast to this, there are other areas in serotonergic neurons where dSERT expression and/or function are uncoupled from synaptic neurotransmitter recycling and serotonin release.

Brain organization and the roots of anticipation in Drosophila olfactory conditioning,21168436,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.12.006,"Defining learning at the molecular and physiological level has been one of the greatest challenges in biology. Recent research suggests that by studying fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) brain organization we can now begin to unravel some of these mysteries. The fruit fly brain is organized into executive centers that regulate anatomically separate behavioral systems. The mushroom body is an example of an executive center which is modified by olfactory conditioning. During this simple form of learning, an odor is paired with either food or shock. Either experience alters distinguishable specific circuitry within the mushroom body. Results suggest that after conditioning an odor to food, the mushroom body will activate a feeding system via a subset of its circuitry. After conditioning an odor to shock, the mushroom body will instead activate an avoidance system with other subsets of mushroom body neurons. The results of these experiments demonstrate a mechanism for flies to display anticipation of their environment after olfactory conditioning has occurred. However, these results fail to provide evidence for reinforcement, a consequence of action, as part of this mechanism. Instead, specific subsets of dopaminergic and octopaminergic neurons provide a simple pairing signal, in contrast to a reinforcement signal, which allows for prediction of the environment after experience. This view has implications for models of conditioning.",2011,"Gunnar Newquist, Gunnar Newquist"

      Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are increasing in prevalence as our aging population increases in size. Despite this, currently there are no disease-modifying drugs available for the treatment of these conditions. Drosophila melanogaster is a highly tractable model organism that has been successfully used to emulate various aspects of these diseases in vivo. These Drosophila models have not been fully exploited in drug discovery and design strategies.

Transcriptional networks for alcohol sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster,21270389,10.1534/genetics.110.125229,"Understanding the genetic architecture of polygenic traits requires investigating how complex networks of interacting molecules mediate the effect of genetic variation on organismal phenotypes. We used a combination of P-element mutagenesis and analysis of natural variation in gene expression to predict transcriptional networks that underlie alcohol sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster. We identified 139 unique P-element mutations (124 in genes) that affect sensitivity or resistance to alcohol exposure. Further analyses of nine of the lines showed that the P-elements affected expression levels of the tagged genes, and P-element excision resulted in phenotypic reversion. The majority of the mutations were in computationally predicted genes or genes with unexpected effects on alcohol phenotypes. Therefore we sought to understand the biological relationships among 21 of these genes by leveraging genetic correlations among genetically variable transcripts in wild-derived inbred lines to predict coregulated transcriptional networks. A total of 32 ""hub"" genes were common to two or more networks associated with the focal genes. We used RNAi-mediated inhibition of expression of focal genes and of hub genes connected to them in the network to confirm their effects on alcohol-related phenotypes. We then expanded the computational networks using the hub genes as foci and again validated network predictions. Iteration of this approach allows a stepwise expansion of the network with simultaneous functional validation. Although coregulated transcriptional networks do not provide information about causal relationships among their constituent transcripts, they provide a framework for subsequent functional studies on the genetic basis of alcohol sensitivity.",2011,"Tatiana V Morozova, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt, Tatiana V Morozova, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt"
"[Symbiotic bacteria, which modify reproduction processes of Drosophila melanogaster]",21598659,,"Cytoplasmic bacteria-symbionts are actively investigated all over the world for the last ten years. The scale of their spreading in natural and laboratory populations of invertebrates, especially arthropods, is impressing scientists' imagination. Ways of their intraspecific and interspecific transmission are various. The nature and mechanisms of their interaction both between themselves and with their hosts are extremely diverse. Cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis, male-killing, feminization, tissue degeneration and others are those phenotypic effects, which intracellular bacteria can cause in their hosts. Moreover, the same bacterium can have diverse influences on different hosts. So it is possible to talk about many-sidedness of endosymbiont interaction with a host, which is determined both by bacterium and host biology. However, majority of phenotypic effects is directed to the successful colonization of hosts' populations by increasing the number of infected females. Alas, the mechanisms of interaction are still not enough investigated. Besides, intracellular bacteria-symbionts can be one of the factors of the so-called ""infectious species formation"".

The genome of Daphnia pulex, the only crustacean genome available for public use, provides a unique resource for identifying putative circadian proteins in this species.

The sequences of core clock (e.g. CLOCK, CYCLE, PERIOD, TIMELESS and CRYPTOCHROME 2), clock input (CRYPTOCHROME 1) and clock output (PIGMENT DISPERSING HORMONE RECEPTOR) proteins were deduced. Structural analyses and alignment of the Daphnia proteins with their Drosophila counterparts revealed extensive sequence conservation, particularly in functional domains. Comparisons of the Daphnia proteins with other sequences showed that they are, in most cases, more similar to homologs from other species, including vertebrates, than they are to those of Drosophila. The presence of both CRYPTOCHROME 1 and 2 in Daphnia suggests the organization of its clock may be more similar to that of the butterfly Danaus plexippus than to that of Drosophila (which possesses CRYPTOCHROME 1 but not CRYPTOCHROME 2).

Multiple TGF-Î² superfamily signals modulate the adult Drosophila immune response,21962711,10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.048,"TGF-Î² superfamily signals play complex roles in regulation of tissue repair and inflammation in mammals [1].

We find that both TGF-Î² signals exhibit complex regulation in response to wounding and infection, each is expressed in a subset of phagocytes, and each inhibits a specific arm of the immune response. dpp is rapidly activated by wounds and represses the production of antimicrobial peptides; flies lacking dpp function display persistent, strong antimicrobial peptide expression after even a small wound. dawdle, in contrast, is activated by Gram-positive bacterial infection but repressed by Gram-negative infection or wounding; its role is to limit infection-induced melanization. Flies lacking dawdle function exhibit melanization even when uninfected. Together, these data imply a model in which the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) dpp is an important inhibitor of inflammation following sterile injury whereas the activin-like dawdle determines the nature of the induced immune response.",2011,"Rebecca I Clark, Katie J Woodcock, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Geissmann, CÃ©line Trouillet, Marc S Dionne, Rebecca I Clark, Katie J Woodcock, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Geissmann, CÃ©line Trouillet, Marc S Dionne"

In addition, we present a multiple reaction monitoring (LC-MRM) method for the absolute quantification of the major phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids of Drosophila. Using both normal- and reversed-phase LC followed by accurate mass analysis and MS/MS on an LTQ-Orbitrap instrument, we evaluated the lipid composition of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. A total of 74 lipid species were identified consisting of glycerphospholipids belonging to the PE, PC, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylserine (PS) classes including several plasmanyl PE species, as well as triacylglycerides, cardiolipins, ceramides, and PE ceramides. Individual PE and PC phospholipids were then quantified using an LC-MRM approach. Reversed-phase chromatography followed by monitoring on a QTrap 4000 instrument of 21 MRM transitions combined with calibration curves constructed using internal standards enabled the absolute quantification of 28 PE and PC lipid species with limits of quantification of 3 and 5 pg/Î¼L, respectively. Internal standards accounted for the differences in ionization efficiencies of PE and PC phospholipids, facilitating more accurate lipid abundance measurements. The method presented here builds on previous Drosophila work by making the quantification of absolute lipid abundance possible and will be of interest to scientists who study variation and changes in the degree of unsaturation, fatty acid carbon length, and head-group concentration among individuals of different genotypes in response to environmental, genetic, or physiological perturbation in small insects.

Nonclassical regulation of transcription: interchromosomal interactions at the malic enzyme locus of Drosophila melanogaster,21900270,10.1534/genetics.111.133231,"Regulation of transcription can be a complex process in which many cis- and trans-interactions determine the final pattern of expression.

Here we describe a novel case of trans-interaction between alleles of the Malic enzyme (Men) locus in Drosophila melanogaster that results in allele-specific, non-additive gene expression. Using both empirical biochemical and predictive bioinformatic approaches, we show that the regulatory elements of one allele are capable of interacting in trans with, and modifying the expression of, the second allele. Furthermore, we show that nonlocal factors--different genetic backgrounds--are capable of significant interactions with individual Men alleles, suggesting that these trans-effects can be modified by both locally and distantly acting elements. In sum, these results emphasize the complexity of gene regulation and the need to understand both small- and large-scale interactions as more complete models of the role of trans-interactions in gene regulation are developed.",2011,"Thomas E Lum, Thomas J S Merritt, Thomas E Lum, Thomas J S Merritt"

Females of both species preferred V. vinifera over C. oblonga when offered to lay eggs on grape and/or quince, with D. melanogaster showing a more biased preference for V. vinifera than its sibling. Concerning performance, flies reared in C. oblonga developed faster than in V. vinifera, regardless of the species and D. simulans had a shorter developmental time than D. melanogaster.

Effect of PARP-1 overexpression and pharmacological inhibition of NF-kB on the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster,22184968,,"Age-dependent accumulation of genome rearrangements leads to cellular senescence, overall aging and lifespan decreasing of the organism. In this respect, it is important to study the effect of overexpression of DNA repair genes on the lifespan and aging parameters (rates of age-related decline of fertility and locomotor activity). The present work investigates how the overexpression of the PARP-1 gene, which is involved in various mechanisms of DNA repair (base excision repair and DNA double-strand breaks repair), combined with a pharmacological inhibition of the NF-kB transcription factor that controls the genes of inflammatory response, affects the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster. It is demonstrated that in males, constitutive activation of PARP-1 overexpression in the nervous system throughout the lifetime results in reduced median (by 14%) and maximum (by 8%) lifespan, whereas in females the median (by 14%) and maximum (by 20%) lifespan increases. Activation of PARP-1 overexpression in the imago (conditionally) results in extension of the median (by 3-16%) and the maximum (by 10-15%) lifespan in females and males, respectively. The lifespan increase in females with PARP-1 conditional overexpression was accompanied by decrease of fertility.

Approaches to separate and identify polyADP-ribosylated proteins using poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase-knockout Drosophila,21870272,10.1007/978-1-61779-270-0_22,"PolyADP-ribosylation plays an essential function in maintenance of genomic stability and cell survival. Although there are several proteins served as acceptor proteins in vitro, there are few proteins in vivo that are identified, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1. We have been studying to analyze the mechanism of neuronal cell death observed in poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG)-knockout Drosophila melanogaster that shows accumulation of polyADP-ribosylated proteins in the brain. As the first step, we have been trying to isolate the polyADP-ribosylated accepter proteins from the PARG-knockout fly. The strategy is to extract the polyADP-ribosylated proteins and isolate them with affinity chromatography using monoclonal antibody against poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) (10H). The bound fraction was eluted by buffer containing salt. Next, part of eluted fraction is treated with NaOH for separating the proteins from PAR chain. Nontreated fraction and treated fraction were separated with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. After protein staining, the specific spots that were newly found after NaOH treatment were candidate acceptor proteins for polyADP-ribosylation in vivo and could be analyzed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Gustatory Receptors Required for Avoiding the Toxic Compound Coumarin in Drosophila melanogaster,26912085,10.14348/molcells.2016.2250,"Coumarin is a phenolic compound that mainly affects the liver due to its metabolization into a toxic compound. The deterrent and ovicidal activities of coumarin in insect models such as Drosophila melanogaster have been reported. Here we explore the molecular mechanisms by which these insects protect themselves and their eggs from this toxic plant metabolite. Coumarin was fatal to the flies in a dosage-dependent manner. However, coumarin feeding could be inhibited through activation of the aversive gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), but not the olfactory receptor neurons. Furthermore, three gustatory receptors, GR33a, GR66a, and GR93a, functioned together in coumarin detection by the proboscis. However, GR33a, but not GR66a and GR93a, was required to avoid coumarin during oviposition, with a choice of the same substrates provided as in binary food choice assay. Taken together, these findings suggest that anti-feeding activity and oviposition to avoid coumarin occur via separate mechanisms.",2016,"Seeta Poudel, Youngseok Lee, Seeta Poudel, Youngseok Lee"
Organization and function of Drosophila odorant binding proteins,27845621,10.7554/eLife.20242,"Odorant binding proteins (Obps) are remarkable in their number, diversity, and abundance, yet their role in olfactory coding remains unclear. They are widely believed to be required for transporting hydrophobic odorants through an aqueous lymph to odorant receptors. We construct a map of the Drosophila antenna, in which the abundant Obps are mapped to olfactory sensilla with defined functions. The results lay a foundation for an incisive analysis of Obp function. The map identifies a sensillum type that contains a single abundant Obp, Obp28a. Surprisingly, deletion of the sole abundant Obp in these sensilla does not reduce the magnitude of their olfactory responses. The results suggest that this Obp is not required for odorant transport and that this sensillum does not require an abundant Obp. The results further suggest a novel role for this Obp in buffering changes in the odor environment, perhaps providing a molecular form of gain control.",2016,"Nikki K Larter, Jennifer S Sun, John R Carlson, Nikki K Larter, Jennifer S Sun, John R Carlson"

Understanding Dynamics of Information Transmission in Drosophila melanogaster Using a Statistical Modeling Framework for Longitudinal Network Data (the RSiena Package),27148146,10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00539,"Social learning - the transmission of behaviors through observation or interaction with conspecifics - can be viewed as a decision-making process driven by interactions among individuals. Animal group structures change over time and interactions among individuals occur in particular orders that may be repeated following specific patterns, change in their nature, or disappear completely. Here we used a stochastic actor-oriented model built using the RSiena package in R to estimate individual behaviors and their changes through time, by analyzing the dynamic of the interaction network of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster during social learning experiments. In particular, we re-analyzed an experimental dataset where uninformed flies, left free to interact with informed ones, acquired and later used information about oviposition site choice obtained by social interactions. We estimated the degree to which the uninformed flies had successfully acquired the information carried by informed individuals using the proportion of eggs laid by uninformed flies on the medium their conspecifics had been trained to favor. Regardless of the degree of information acquisition measured in uninformed individuals, they always received and started interactions more frequently than informed ones did. However, information was efficiently transmitted (i.e., uninformed flies predominantly laid eggs on the same medium informed ones had learn to prefer) only when the difference in contacts sent between the two fly types was small. Interestingly, we found that the degree of reciprocation, the tendency of individuals to form mutual connections between each other, strongly affected oviposition site choice in uninformed flies.

Microfluidic Devices for Automation of Assays on Drosophila Melanogaster for Applications in Drug Discovery and Biological Studies,27194358,10.2174/1389201017666160519112506,"Drug discovery is a long and expensive process, which usually takes 12-15 years and could cost up to ~$1 billion. Conventional drug discovery process starts with high throughput screening and selection of drug candidates that bind to specific target associated with a disease condition. However, this process does not consider whether the chosen candidate is optimal not only for binding but also for ease of administration, distribution in the body, effect of metabolism and associated toxicity if any. A holistic approach, using model organisms early in the drug discovery process to select drug candidates that are optimal not only in binding but also suitable for administration, distribution and are not toxic is now considered as a viable way for lowering the cost and time associated with the drug discovery process. However, the conventional drug discovery assays using Drosophila are manual and required skill operator, which makes them expensive and not suitable for high-throughput screening. Recently, microfluidics has been used to automate many of the operations (e.g. sorting, positioning, drug delivery) associated with the Drosophila drug discovery assays and thereby increase their throughput. This review highlights recent microfluidic devices that have been developed for Drosophila assays with primary application towards drug discovery for human diseases.

Positive geotactic behaviors induced by geomagnetic field in Drosophila,27192976,10.1186/s13041-016-0235-1,"Background:
      
    

    
      Appropriate vertical movement is critical for the survival of flying animals. Although negative geotaxis (moving away from Earth) driven by gravity has been extensively studied, much less is understood concerning a static regulatory mechanism for inducing positive geotaxis (moving toward Earth).
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism, we showed that geomagnetic field (GMF) induces positive geotaxis and antagonizes negative gravitaxis. Remarkably, GMF acts as a sensory cue for an appetite-driven associative learning behavior through the GMF-induced positive geotaxis. This GMF-induced positive geotaxis requires the three geotaxis genes, such as cry, pyx and pdf, and the corresponding neurons residing in Johnston's organ of the fly's antennae.

Expression of human Cfdp1 gene in Drosophila reveals new insights into the function of the evolutionarily conserved BCNT protein family,27151176,10.1038/srep25511,"The Bucentaur (BCNT) protein family is widely distributed in eukaryotes and is characterized by a highly conserved C-terminal domain. This family was identified two decades ago in ruminants, but its role(s) remained largely unknown. Investigating cellular functions and mechanism of action of BCNT proteins is challenging, because they have been implicated in human craniofacial development. Recently, we found that YETI, the D. melanogaster BCNT, is a chromatin factor that participates to H2A.V deposition. Here we report the effects of in vivo expression of CFDP1, the human BCNT protein, in Drosophila melanogaster. We show that CFDP1, similarly to YETI, binds to chromatin and its expression results in a wide range of abnormalities highly reminiscent of those observed in Yeti null mutants. This indicates that CFDP1 expressed in flies behaves in a dominant negative fashion disrupting the YETI function. Moreover, GST pull-down provides evidence indicating that 1) both YETI and CFDP1 undergo homodimerization and 2) YETI and CFDP1 physically interact each other by forming inactive heterodimers that would trigger the observed dominant-negative effect. Overall, our findings highlight unanticipated evidences suggesting that homodimerization mediated by the BCNT domain is integral to the chromatin functions of BCNT proteins.",2016,"Giovanni Messina, Maria Teresa Atterrato, Laura Fanti, Ennio Giordano, Patrizio Dimitri, Giovanni Messina, Maria Teresa Atterrato, Laura Fanti, Ennio Giordano, Patrizio Dimitri"
Olfactory Behaviors Assayed by Computer Tracking Of Drosophila in a Four-quadrant Olfactometer,27585032,10.3791/54346,"A key challenge in neurobiology is to understand how neural circuits function to guide appropriate animal behaviors. Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model system for such investigations due to its complex behaviors, powerful genetic techniques, and compact nervous system. Laboratory behavioral assays have long been used with Drosophila to simulate properties of the natural environment and study the neural mechanisms underlying the corresponding behaviors (e.g. phototaxis, chemotaxis, sensory learning and memory)(1-3). With the recent availability of large collections of transgenic Drosophila lines that label specific neural subsets, behavioral assays have taken on a prominent role to link neurons with behaviors(4-11). Versatile and reproducible paradigms, together with the underlying computational routines for data analysis, are indispensable for rapid tests of candidate fly lines with various genotypes. Particularly useful are setups that are flexible in the number of animals tested, duration of experiments and nature of presented stimuli. The assay of choice should also generate reproducible data that is easy to acquire and analyze. Here, we present a detailed description of a system and protocol for assaying behavioral responses of Drosophila flies in a large four-field arena. The setup is used here to assay responses of flies to a single olfactory stimulus; however, the same setup may be modified to test multiple olfactory, visual or optogenetic stimuli, or a combination of these. The olfactometer setup records the activity of fly populations responding to odors, and computational analytical methods are applied to quantify fly behaviors. The collected data are analyzed to get a quick read-out of an experimental run, which is essential for efficient data collection and the optimization of experimental conditions.",2016,"Chun-Chieh Lin, Olena Riabinina, Christopher J Potter, Chun-Chieh Lin, Olena Riabinina, Christopher J Potter"
Decanalization of wing development accompanied the evolution of large wings in high-altitude Drosophila,26755605,10.1073/pnas.1515964113,"In higher organisms, the phenotypic impacts of potentially harmful or beneficial mutations are often modulated by complex developmental networks. Stabilizing selection may favor the evolution of developmental canalization--that is, robustness despite perturbation--to insulate development against environmental and genetic variability. In contrast, directional selection acts to alter the developmental process, possibly undermining the molecular mechanisms that buffer a trait's development, but this scenario has not been shown in nature. Here, we examined the developmental consequences of size increase in highland Ethiopian Drosophila melanogaster. Ethiopian inbred strains exhibited much higher frequencies of wing abnormalities than lowland populations, consistent with an elevated susceptibility to the genetic perturbation of inbreeding. We then used mutagenesis to test whether Ethiopian wing development is, indeed, decanalized. Ethiopian strains were far more susceptible to this genetic disruption of development, yielding 26 times more novel wing abnormalities than lowland strains in F2 males. Wing size and developmental perturbability cosegregated in the offspring of between-population crosses, suggesting that genes conferring size differences had undermined developmental buffering mechanisms. Our findings represent the first observation, to our knowledge, of morphological evolution associated with decanalization in the same tissue, underscoring the sensitivity of development to adaptive change.",2016,"Justin B Lack, Matthew J Monette, Evan J Johanning, Quentin D Sprengelmeyer, John E Pool, Justin B Lack, Matthew J Monette, Evan J Johanning, Quentin D Sprengelmeyer, John E Pool"

Prenatal hyperbaric normoxia treatment improves healthspan and regulates chitin metabolic genes in Drosophila melanogaster,27777382,10.18632/aging.101084,"Aging is a universal, irreversible process accompanied by physiological declines that culminate in death. Rapid progress in gerontology research has revealed that aging can be slowed through mild stress-induced hormesis. We previously reported that hyperbaric normoxia (HN, 2 atm absolute pressure with 10% O2) induces a cytoprotective response in vitro by regulating fibronectin. In the present study, we investigated the hormetic effects of prenatal HN exposure on Drosophila healthspan related to molecular defense mechanisms. HN exposure had no disruptive effect on developmental rate or adult body weight. However, lifespan was clearly enhanced, as was resistance to oxidative and heat stress. In addition, levels of reactive oxygen species were significantly decreased and motor performance was increased. HN stress has been shown to trigger molecular changes in the heat shock response and ROS scavenging system, including hsp70, catalase, glutathione synthase, and MnSOD. Furthermore, to determine the hormetic mechanism underlying these phenotypic and molecular changes, we performed a genome-wide profiling in HN-exposed and control flies. Genes encoding chitin metabolism were highly up-regulated, which could possibly serve to scavenge free radicals.

No apparent cost of evolved immune response in Drosophila melanogaster,26932243,10.1111/evo.12896,"Maintenance and deployment of the immune system are costly and are hence predicted to trade-off with other resource-demanding traits, such as reproduction. We subjected this longstanding idea to test using laboratory experimental evolution approach. In the present study, replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster were subjected to three selection regimes-I (Infection with Pseudomonas entomophila), S (Sham-infection with MgSO4 ), and U (Unhandled Control). After 30 generations of selection flies from the I regime had evolved better survivorship upon infection with P. entomophila compared to flies from U and S regimes. However, contrary to expectations and previous reports, we did not find any evidence of trade-offs between immunity and other life history related traits, such as longevity, fecundity, egg hatchability, or development time. After 45 generations of selection, the selection was relaxed for a set of populations. Even after 15 generations, the postinfection survivorship of populations under relaxed selection regime did not decline. We speculate that either there is a negligible cost to the evolved immune response or that trade-offs occur on traits such as reproductive behavior or other immune mechanisms that we have not investigated in this study.

Bcl-2 homologue Debcl enhances Î±-synuclein-induced phenotypes in Drosophila,27672511,10.7717/peerj.2461,"Background:
      
    

    
      Parkinson disease (PD) is a debilitating movement disorder that afflicts 1-2% of the population over 50 years of age. The common hallmark for both sporadic and familial forms of PD is mitochondrial dysfunction. Mammals have at least twenty proapoptotic and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, in contrast, only two Bcl-2 family genes have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster, the proapoptotic mitochondrial localized Debcl and the antiapoptotic Buffy. The expression of the human transgene Î±-synuclein, a gene that is strongly associated with inherited forms of PD, in dopaminergic neurons (DA) of Drosophila, results in loss of neurons and locomotor dysfunction to model PD in flies. The altered expression of Debcl in the DA neurons and neuron-rich eye and along with the expression of Î±-synuclein offers an opportunity to highlight the role of Debcl in mitochondrial-dependent neuronal degeneration and death.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The directed overexpression of Debcl using the Ddc-Gal4 transgene in the DA of Drosophila resulted in flies with severely decreased survival and a premature age-dependent loss in climbing ability. The inhibition of Debcl resulted in enhanced survival and improved climbing ability whereas the overexpression of Debcl in the Î±-synuclein-induced Drosophila model of PD resulted in more severe phenotypes. In addition, the co-expression of Debcl along with Buffy partially counteracts the Debcl-induced phenotypes, to improve the lifespan and the associated loss of locomotor ability observed. In complementary experiments, the overexpression of Debcl along with the expression of Î±-synuclein in the eye, enhanced the eye ablation that results from the overexpression of Debcl. The co-expression of Buffy along with Debcl overexpression results in the rescue of the moderate developmental eye defects. The co-expression of Buffy along with inhibition of Debcl partially restores the eye to a roughened eye phenotype.
    

    
  


        Discussion:
      
    

    
      The overexpression of Debcl in DA neurons produces flies with shortened lifespan and impaired locomotor ability, phenotypes that are strongly associated with models of PD in Drosophila. The co-expression of Debcl along with Î±-synuclein enhanced the PD-like phenotypes. The co-expression of Debcl along with Buffy suppresses these phenotypes. Complementary experiments in the Drosophila eye show similar trends during development. Taken all together these results suggest a role for Debcl in neurodegenerative disorders.",2016,"P Githure M'Angale, Brian E Staveley, P Githure M'Angale, Brian E Staveley"
Whole-Genome Analysis of Individual Meiotic Events in Drosophila melanogaster Reveals That Noncrossover Gene Conversions Are Insensitive to Interference and the Centromere Effect,26944917,10.1534/genetics.115.186486,"A century of genetic analysis has revealed that multiple mechanisms control the distribution of meiotic crossover events. In Drosophila melanogaster, two significant positional controls are interference and the strongly polar centromere effect. Here, we assess the factors controlling the distribution of crossovers (COs) and noncrossover gene conversions (NCOs) along all five major chromosome arms in 196 single meiotic divisions to generate a more detailed understanding of these controls on a genome-wide scale. Analyzing the outcomes of single meiotic events allows us to distinguish among different classes of meiotic recombination. In so doing, we identified 291 NCOs spread uniformly among the five major chromosome arms and 541 COs (including 52 double crossovers and one triple crossover). We find that unlike COs, NCOs are insensitive to the centromere effect and do not demonstrate interference. Although the positions of COs appear to be determined predominately by the long-range influences of interference and the centromere effect, each chromosome may display a different pattern of sensitivity to interference, suggesting that interference may not be a uniform global property. In addition, unbiased sequencing of a large number of individuals allows us to describe the formation of de novo copy number variants, the majority of which appear to be mediated by unequal crossing over between transposable elements.

Defective Phagocytic Corpse Processing Results in Neurodegeneration and Can Be Rescued by TORC1 Activation,26985028,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1912-15.2016,"The removal of apoptotic cell corpses is important for maintaining homeostasis. Previously, defects in apoptotic cell clearance have been linked to neurodegeneration. However, the mechanisms underlying this are still poorly understood. In this study, we report that the absence of the phagocytic receptor Draper in glia leads to a pronounced accumulation of apoptotic neurons in the brain of Drosophila melanogaster. These dead cells persist in the brain throughout the lifespan of the organism and are associated with age-dependent neurodegeneration. Our data indicate that corpses persist because of defective phagosome maturation, rather than recognition defects. TORC1 activation, or inhibition of Atg1, in glia is sufficient to rescue corpse accumulation as well as neurodegeneration. These results suggest that phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons by glia during development is essential for brain homeostasis in adult flies. Furthermore, it suggests that TORC1 regulates Draper-mediated phagosome maturation.

We therefore investigated during in vitro murine myogenesis a mammalian homolog, Kirrel, of the Drosophila Melanogaster genes Roughest (Rst) and Kin of Irre (Kirre) which regulate somatic muscle cell fusion during embryonic development. Our results demonstrate the presence of a novel murine Kirrel isoform containing a truncated cytoplasmic domain which we term Kirrel B. Protein expression levels of Kirrel B are inverse to the occurrence of cell fusion events during in vitro myogenesis which is in stark contrast to the expression profile of Rst and Kirre during myogenesis in Drosophila. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of cell fusion confirmed the inverse expression pattern of Kirrel B protein levels in relation to cell fusion events.

Mechanisms of skeletal muscle aging: insights from Drosophila and mammalian models,24092876,10.1242/dmm.012559,"A characteristic feature of aged humans and other mammals is the debilitating, progressive loss of skeletal muscle function and mass that is known as sarcopenia. Age-related muscle dysfunction occurs to an even greater extent during the relatively short lifespan of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Studies in model organisms indicate that sarcopenia is driven by a combination of muscle tissue extrinsic and intrinsic factors, and that it fundamentally differs from the rapid atrophy of muscles observed following disuse and fasting. Extrinsic changes in innervation, stem cell function and endocrine regulation of muscle homeostasis contribute to muscle aging. In addition, organelle dysfunction and compromised protein homeostasis are among the primary intrinsic causes. Some of these age-related changes can in turn contribute to the induction of compensatory stress responses that have a protective role during muscle aging. In this Review, we outline how studies in Drosophila and mammalian model organisms can each provide distinct advantages to facilitate the understanding of this complex multifactorial condition and how they can be used to identify suitable therapies.",2013,"Fabio Demontis, Rosanna Piccirillo, Alfred L Goldberg, Norbert Perrimon, Fabio Demontis, Rosanna Piccirillo, Alfred L Goldberg, Norbert Perrimon"

Biophysical and genetic analysis of iron partitioning and ferritin function in Drosophila melanogaster,23771129,10.1039/c3mt00118k,"Metals have vital functions as prosthetic groups in enzymes, but in labile form they can propagate oxidative stress. The primary function of ferritin is to store bioavailable iron in the form of ferrihydrite. In animals, ferritin is also used to traffic and recycle iron, and to modulate intestinal iron absorption. However, the effect of ferritin accumulation on cellular iron bioavailability remains poorly understood. Moreover, putative in vivo interactions of ferritin with other metal ions have been proposed, but their physiological relevance remains unclear. Here, heterozygous mutant and overexpression ferritin strains of Drosophila melanogaster were subjected to dietary iron manipulations to study the dynamics of iron partition between ferritin and other proteins. Quantitative magnetic analysis of whole fly samples indicated that iron loading of the ferritin core varied in the different genotypes. Total paramagnetic iron content, a likely correlate of bioavailable iron, was reduced in flies overexpressing ferritin when compared with control white flies. Further, three-dimensional maps of the ferritin protein shell and iron core were obtained from single particle transmission electron microscopy imaging and confirmed the similarity between Drosophila and Trichoplusia ferritin structures. Purified Drosophila ferritin also contained small amounts of zinc and manganese. Flies that overexpressed ferritin accumulated in their bodies half the amount of manganese compared to their respective controls. Our results indicate that ferritin may be involved in the homeostasis of other divalent metals, besides iron, and that overexpression of ferritin, sometimes employed to rescue neurodegenerative models of disease, serves to limit divalent metal bio-availability in cells.",2013,"LucÃ­a GutiÃ©rrez, Kristina Zubow, Jon Nield, Alexis Gambis, Bertrand Mollereau, Francisco J LÃ¡zaro, Fanis Missirlis, LucÃ­a GutiÃ©rrez, Kristina Zubow, Jon Nield, Alexis Gambis, Bertrand Mollereau, Francisco J LÃ¡zaro, Fanis Missirlis"
Genetic background and GxE interactions modulate the penetrance of a naturally occurring wing mutation in Drosophila melanogaster,24002866,10.1534/g3.113.007831,"Many genes involved in producing complex traits are incompletely penetrant. One such example is vesiculated, an X-linked gene in Drosophila melanogaster that results in wing defects. To examine the genetic architecture of a complex trait (wings containing vesicles), we placed a naturally occurring variant into multiple autosomal backgrounds and quantified penetrance and expressivity at a range of developmental temperatures. We found significant epistasis, genotype-by-environment interactions, and maternal effects. Sex and temperature effects were modulated by genetic background. The severity of wing phenotypes also varied across different genetic backgrounds, and expressivity was positively correlated with penetrance. We also found evidence of naturally segregating suppressors of vesiculated. These suppressors were present on both the second and third chromosomes, and complex interactions were observed. Taken together, these findings indicate that multiple genetic and environmental factors modulate the phenotypic effects of a naturally occurring vesiculated allele.",2013,"Joseph Lachance, Lawrence Jung, John R True, Joseph Lachance, Lawrence Jung, John R True"
[A genetic system for somatic and germinal lineage tracing in the Drosophila melanogaster gonads],23795463,,"Significant progress in the developmental biology of Drosophila is largely due to the improvement of methods of genetic manipulation and, in particular, development of ways to create mosaic organisms. The main characteristic of the mosaic organisms is the presence of genetically different populations of cells. For example, some tissues express a transgenic reporter gene that is absent in other cells of the body. This principle is used in a variety of the methods with the common name lineage tracing. The essence of these approaches is to perform the targeted changes in the genetic apparatus of progenitor cells that give rise to cell lines or organs and tissues. Genetic modification in progenitor cells, such as the ability to express a fluorescent protein, will be inherited by the next cell generations, and, as a result, the entire cell line or tissue will have a tag, which distinguishes it from the rest of the body. The lineage tracing methods allow tracking the cell generations, studying the cell proliferation process, tracing their origin and investigating the function of genes of interest in the development of a single tissue or organ. We have designed an approach to selectively label germ line or somatic cells in the gonads of Drosophila.",2013,"P P Laktionov, D A Maksimov, E N Andreeva, V V Shloma, S N Beliakin, P P Laktionov, D A Maksimov, E N Andreeva, V V Shloma, S N Beliakin"
Inbreeding reveals mode of past selection on male reproductive characters in Drosophila melanogaster,23919154,10.1002/ece3.625,"Directional dominance is a prerequisite of inbreeding depression. Directionality arises when selection drives alleles that increase fitness to fixation and eliminates dominant deleterious alleles, while deleterious recessives are hidden from it and maintained at low frequencies. Traits under directional selection (i.e., fitness traits) are expected to show directional dominance and therefore an increased susceptibility to inbreeding depression. In contrast, traits under stabilizing selection or weakly linked to fitness are predicted to exhibit little-to-no inbreeding depression. Here, we quantify the extent of inbreeding depression in a range of male reproductive characters and then infer the mode of past selection on them. The use of transgenic populations of Drosophila melanogaster with red or green fluorescent-tagged sperm heads permitted in vivo discrimination of sperm from competing males and quantification of characteristics of ejaculate composition, performance, and fate. We found that male attractiveness (mating latency) and competitive fertilization success (P2) both show some inbreeding depression, suggesting they may have been under directional selection, whereas sperm length showed no inbreeding depression suggesting a history of stabilizing selection. However, despite having measured several sperm quality and quantity traits, our data did not allow us to discern the mechanism underlying the lowered competitive fertilization success of inbred (f = 0.50) males.",2013,"Outi Ala-Honkola, David J Hosken, Mollie K Manier, Stefan LÃ¼pold, Elizabeth M Droge-Young, Kirstin S Berben, William F Collins, John M Belote, Scott Pitnick, Outi Ala-Honkola, David J Hosken, Mollie K Manier, Stefan LÃ¼pold, Elizabeth M Droge-Young, Kirstin S Berben, William F Collins, John M Belote, Scott Pitnick"
Tay bridge is a negative regulator of EGFR signalling and interacts with Erk and Mkp3 in the Drosophila melanogaster wing,24348264,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003982,"The regulation of Extracellular regulated kinase (Erk) activity is a key aspect of signalling by pathways activated by extracellular ligands acting through tyrosine kinase transmembrane receptors. In this process, participate proteins with kinase activity that phosphorylate and activate Erk, as well as different phosphatases that inactivate Erk by de-phosphorylation. The state of Erk phosphorylation affects not only its activity, but also its subcellular localization, defining the repertoire of Erk target proteins, and consequently, the cellular response to Erk. In this work, we characterise Tay bridge as a novel component of the EGFR/Erk signalling pathway. Tay bridge is a large nuclear protein with a domain of homology with human AUTS2, and was previously identified due to the neuronal phenotypes displayed by loss-of-function mutations. We show that Tay bridge antagonizes EGFR signalling in the Drosophila melanogaster wing disc and other tissues, and that the protein interacts with both Erk and Mkp3. We suggest that Tay bridge constitutes a novel element involved in the regulation of Erk activity, acting as a nuclear docking for Erk that retains this protein in an inactive form in the nucleus.",2013,"Cristina Molnar, Jose F de Celis, Cristina Molnar, Jose F de Celis"
Genome-wide association mapping of natural variation in odour-guided behaviour in Drosophila,23682951,10.1111/gbb.12048,"A defining goal in the field of behavioural genetics is to identify the key genes or genetic networks that shape behaviour. A corollary to this goal is the goal of identifying genetic variants that are responsible for variation in the behaviour. These goals are achieved by measuring behavioural responses to controlled stimuli, in the present case the responses of Drosophila melanogaster to olfactory stimuli. We used a high-throughput behavioural assay system to test a panel of 157 Drosophila inbred lines derived from a natural population for both temporal and spatial dynamics of odour-guided behaviour. We observed significant variation in response to the odourant 2,3-butanedione, a volatile compound present in fermenting fruit. The recent whole genome sequencing of these inbred lines allowed us to then perform genome-wide association analyses in order to identify genetic polymorphisms underlying variation in responses. These analyses revealed numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with variation in responses. Among the candidate genes identified were both novel and previously identified olfaction-related genes. Further, gene network analyses suggest that genes influencing variation in odour-guided behaviour are enriched for functions involving neural processing and that these genes form a pleiotropic interaction network. We examined several of these candidate genes that were highly connected in the protein- and genetic interaction networks using RNA interference. Our results showed that subtle changes influencing nervous system function can result in marked differences in behaviour.",2013,"E B Brown, J E Layne, C Zhu, A G Jegga, S M Rollmann, E B Brown, J E Layne, C Zhu, A G Jegga, S M Rollmann"
Elevated expression of the integrin-associated protein PINCH suppresses the defects of Drosophila melanogaster muscle hypercontraction mutants,23555310,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003406,"A variety of human diseases arise from mutations that alter muscle contraction. Evolutionary conservation allows genetic studies in Drosophila melanogaster to be used to better understand these myopathies and suggest novel therapeutic strategies. Integrin-mediated adhesion is required to support muscle structure and function, and expression of Integrin adhesive complex (IAC) proteins is modulated to adapt to varying levels of mechanical stress within muscle. Mutations in flapwing (flw), a catalytic subunit of myosin phosphatase, result in non-muscle myosin hyperphosphorylation, as well as muscle hypercontraction, defects in size, motility, muscle attachment, and subsequent larval and pupal lethality. We find that moderately elevated expression of the IAC protein PINCH significantly rescues flw phenotypes. Rescue requires PINCH be bound to its partners, Integrin-linked kinase and Ras suppressor 1. Rescue is not achieved through dephosphorylation of non-muscle myosin, suggesting a mechanism in which elevated PINCH expression strengthens integrin adhesion. In support of this, elevated expression of PINCH rescues an independent muscle hypercontraction mutant in muscle myosin heavy chain, Mhc(Samba1). By testing a panel of IAC proteins, we show specificity for PINCH expression in the rescue of hypercontraction mutants. These data are consistent with a model in which PINCH is present in limiting quantities within IACs, with increasing PINCH expression reinforcing existing adhesions or allowing for the de novo assembly of new adhesion complexes. Moreover, in myopathies that exhibit hypercontraction, strategic PINCH expression may have therapeutic potential in preserving muscle structure and function.",2013,"Stephen M Pronovost, Mary C Beckerle, Julie L Kadrmas, Stephen M Pronovost, Mary C Beckerle, Julie L Kadrmas"
Acid sensing by sweet and bitter taste neurons in Drosophila melanogaster,23783889,10.1038/ncomms3042,"Drosophila melanogaster can taste various compounds and separate them into few basic categories such as sweet, bitter and salt taste. Here we investigate mechanisms underlying acid detection in Drosophila and report that the fly displays strong taste aversion to common carboxylic acids. We find that acid tastants act by the activation of a subset of bitter neurons and inhibition of sweet neurons. Bitter neurons begin to respond at pH 5 and show an increase in spike frequency as the extracellular pH drops, which does not rely on previously identified chemoreceptors. Notably, sweet neuron activity depends on the balance of sugar and acid tastant concentrations. This is independent of bitter neuron firing, and allows the fly to avoid acid-laced food sources even in the absence of functional bitter neurons. The two mechanisms may allow the fly to better evaluate the risk of ingesting acidic foods and modulate its feeding decisions accordingly.",2013,"Sandhya Charlu, Zev Wisotsky, Adriana Medina, Anupama Dahanukar, Sandhya Charlu, Zev Wisotsky, Adriana Medina, Anupama Dahanukar"
miR-34 is maternally inherited in Drosophila melanogaster and Danio rerio,23470996,10.1093/nar/gkt139,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, endogenous, regulatory RNA molecules that can bind to partially complementary regions on target messenger RNAs and impede their expression or translation. We rationalized that miRNAs, being localized to the cytoplasm, will be maternally inherited during fertilization and may play a role in early development. Although Dicer is known to be essential for the transition from single-celled zygote to two-cell embryo, a direct role for miRNAs has not yet been demonstrated. We identified miRNAs with targets in zygotically expressed transcripts in Drosophila using a combination of transcriptome analysis and miRNA target prediction. We experimentally established that Drosophila miRNA dme-miR-34, the fly homologue of the cancer-related mammalian miRNA miR-34, involved in somatic-cell reprogramming and having critical role in early neuronal differentiation, is present in Drosophila embryos before initiation of zygotic transcription. We also show that the Drosophila miR-34 is dependent on maternal Dicer-1 for its expression in oocytes. Further, we show that miR-34 is also abundant in unfertilized oocytes of zebrafish. Its temporal expression profile during early development showed abundant expression in unfertilized oocytes that gradually decreased by 5 days post-fertilization (dpf). We find that knocking down the maternal, but not the zygotic, miR-34 led to developmental defects in the neuronal system during early embryonic development in zebrafish.

Two types of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in Drosophila and other arthropods,23604020,10.1007/s00018-013-1334-0,"Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) play a central role in the mammalian nervous system. These receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are activated by the agonists acetylcholine and muscarine, and blocked by a variety of antagonists. Mammals have five mAChRs (m1-m5). In this study, we cloned two structurally related GPCRs from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which, after expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells, proved to be muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. One mAChR (the A-type; encoded by gene CG4356) is activated by acetylcholine (EC50, 5 ? 10(-8) M) and muscarine (EC50, 6 ? 10(-8) M) and blocked by the classical mAChR antagonists atropine, scopolamine, and 3-quinuclidinyl-benzilate (QNB), while the other (the B-type; encoded by gene CG7918) is also activated by acetylcholine, but has a 1,000-fold lower sensitivity to muscarine, and is not blocked by the antagonists. A- and B-type mAChRs were also cloned and functionally characterized from the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. Recently, Haga et al. (Nature 2012, 482: 547-551) published the crystal structure of the human m2 mAChR, revealing 14 amino acid residues forming the binding pocket for QNB. These residues are identical between the human m2 and the D. melanogaster and T. castaneum A-type mAChRs, while many of them are different between the human m2 and the B-type receptors. Using bioinformatics, one orthologue of the A-type and one of the B-type mAChRs could also be found in all other arthropods with a sequenced genome. Protostomes, such as arthropods, and deuterostomes, such as mammals and other vertebrates, belong to two evolutionarily distinct lineages of animal evolution that split about 700 million years ago. We found that animals that originated before this split, such as cnidarians (Hydra), had two A-type mAChRs.

Involvement of EnvZ-OmpR two-component system in virulence control of Escherichia coli in Drosophila melanogaster,23886953,10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.07.062,"Bacteria adapt to environmental changes by altering gene expression patterns with the aid of signal transduction machinery called the two-component regulatory system (TCS), which consists of two protein components, a sensor kinase and response regulator. We examined the role of the TCS in bacterial adaptation to host environments using genetically tractable organisms, Escherichia coli as a pathogen and Drosophila melanogaster as a host. To determine the strength of the transcription promoters of TCS-encoding genes in Drosophila, adult flies were infected with a series of E. coli strains that expressed GFP driven by the promoters of genes coding for 27 sensor kinases and 32 response regulators of E. coli TCS followed by the measurement of fluorescence intensities. We further analyzed EnvZ-OmpR among the TCS encoded by genes having stronger promoters. A mutant E. coli strain lacking EnvZ-OmpR had a higher pathogenic effect on fly survival than that of the parental strain, and the forced expression of envZ and ompR in the mutant strain lowered its pathogenicity. The lack of EnvZ-OmpR did not affect the growth of E. coli in a culture medium as well as the level of colony-formable E. coli in flies. An increase in E. coli virulence with the loss of EnvZ-OmpR was observed in flies defective in an Imd-mediated humoral response, and both the mutant and parental strains were equally engulfed by hemocytes in vitro. These results suggest that EnvZ-OmpR mitigated the virulence of E. coli in Drosophila by a mechanism not accompanied by a change of bacterial burden.

Fluorescent imaging of Drosophila melanogaster sperm in the reproductive tract: a new model of flagellar motility,23522468,10.1016/B978-0-12-397944-5.00007-9,"The sperm of Drosophila melanogaster stands out because of its enormous length and perplexing movements that break some norms of flagella. Most flagella with analyzed motility, ranging from flagella of Chlamydomonas to sperm of marine invertebrates and vertebrates, are from a few microns to at most 208 Î¼m in length. Most flagella propagate waves in a constant direction, starting at the base of the flagellum and moving toward the tip (base-to-tip waves). In contrast, the fly sperm is 1.9-mm long and it propagates waves in base-to-tip or tip-to-base direction, generating head-leading or tail-leading movement. Of the two movement orientations, the sperm choose one or the other for a particular movement along the convoluted path leading to fertilization. For example, the sperm enter the seminal receptacle (SR) for storage with a tail-leading movement, but exit it for fertilization with a head-leading movement. Moreover, the sperm move with unusual waveforms. A modified sinusoidal or arc-line waveform generates semistationary movement-moving but staying at a general area-within temporary reservoirs (ejaculatory duct, uterus) and storage organs (SR, spermathecae). In contrast, a corkscrew-like helical waveform is ideal for rapid advancing movement and suspected for traveling through long tubules that interconnect these reservoirs. Here, we describe new methods for capturing these complex sperm movements that naturally occur in the reproductive tract. The imaging methods coupled with large mutant collections and genomic resources make the fly sperm a powerful new model for understanding flagellar motility and its dynamic regulation in vivo. The motility regulatory proteins we have identified in the fly are broadly conserved, thus illustrating a general utility of this model system.",2013,"Xiangyi Lu, Xiangyi Lu"

OBPs contribute to the sensitivity of the olfactory system by transporting odorants through the sensillar lymph, but there are competing hypotheses on how they act at the end of the journey. A few ODEs that have been demonstrated to degrade odorants rapidly may act in signal inactivation alone or in combination with other molecular traps.

High-fidelity promoter profiling reveals widespread alternative promoter usage and transposon-driven developmental gene expression,22936248,10.1101/gr.139618.112,"Many eukaryotic genes possess multiple alternative promoters with distinct expression specificities.

RAMPAGE features a streamlined protocol for fast and easy generation of highly multiplexed sequencing libraries, offers very high transcription start site specificity, generates accurate and reproducible promoter expression measurements, and yields extensive transcript connectivity information through paired-end cDNA sequencing.

We found that >40% of developmentally expressed genes have at least two promoters and that alternative promoters generally implement distinct regulatory programs. Transposable elements, long proposed to play a central role in the evolution of their host genomes through their ability to regulate gene expression, contribute at least 1300 promoters shaping the developmental transcriptome of D. melanogaster. Hundreds of these promoters drive the expression of annotated genes, and transposons often impart their own expression specificity upon the genes they regulate.

      Drosophila melanogaster has been established as a model organism for investigating the developmental gene interactions. The spatio-temporal gene expression patterns of Drosophila melanogaster can be visualized by in situ hybridization and documented as digital images. Automated and efficient tools for analyzing these expression images will provide biological insights into the gene functions, interactions, and networks. To facilitate pattern recognition and comparison, many web-based resources have been created to conduct comparative analysis based on the body part keywords and the associated images. With the fast accumulation of images from high-throughput techniques, manual inspection of images will impose a serious impediment on the pace of biological discovery. It is thus imperative to design an automated system for efficient image annotation and comparison.

      We present a computational framework to perform anatomical keywords annotation for Drosophila gene expression images. The spatial sparse coding approach is used to represent local patches of images in comparison with the well-known bag-of-words (BoW) method. Three pooling functions including max pooling, average pooling and Sqrt (square root of mean squared statistics) pooling are employed to transform the sparse codes to image features. Based on the constructed features, we develop both an image-level scheme and a group-level scheme to tackle the key challenges in annotating Drosophila gene expression pattern images automatically. To deal with the imbalanced data distribution inherent in image annotation tasks, the undersampling method is applied together with majority vote. Results on Drosophila embryonic expression pattern images verify the efficacy of our approach.

Heritability of life span is largely sex limited in Drosophila,24107372,10.1086/673296,"Males and females differ with respect to life span and rate of aging in most animal species. Such sexual dimorphism can be associated with a complex genetic architecture, where only part of the genetic variation is shared between the sexes. However, the extent to which this is true for life span and aging is not known, because studies of life span have given contradictory results and aging has not been studied from this perspective. Here we investigate the additive genetic architecture of life span and aging in Drosophila melanogaster. We find substantial amounts of additive genetic variation for both traits, with more than three-quarters of this variation available for sex-specific evolutionary change. This result shows that the sexes have a profoundly different additive genetic basis for these traits, which has several implications. First, it translates into an, on average, three-times-higher heritability of life span within, compared to between, the sexes. Second, it implies that the sexes are relatively free to evolve with respect to these traits. And third, as life span and aging are traits that integrate over all genetic factors that contribute to mortal disease, it also implies that the genetics of heritable disease differs vastly between the sexes.",2013,"Anne Lehtovaara, Holger Schielzeth, Ilona Flis, Urban Friberg, Anne Lehtovaara, Holger Schielzeth, Ilona Flis, Urban Friberg"
Lessons from sleeping flies: insights from Drosophila melanogaster on the neuronal circuitry and importance of sleep,23701413,10.3109/01677063.2013.791692,"Sleep is a highly conserved behavior whose role is as yet unknown, although it is widely acknowledged as being important. Here we provide an overview of many vital questions regarding this behavior, that have been addressed in recent years using the genetically tractable model organism Drosophila melanogaster in several laboratories around the world. Rest in D. melanogaster has been compared to mammalian sleep and its homeostatic and circadian regulation have been shown to be controlled by intricate neuronal circuitry involving circadian clock neurons, mushroom bodies, and pars intercerebralis, although their exact roles are not entirely clear. We draw attention to the yet unanswered questions and contradictions regarding the nature of the interactions between the brain regions implicated in the control of sleep. Dopamine, octopamine, Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and serotonin are the chief neurotransmitters identified as functioning in different limbs of this circuit, either promoting arousal or sleep by modulating membrane excitability of underlying neurons. Some studies have suggested that certain brain areas may contribute towards both sleep and arousal depending on activation of specific subsets of neurons. Signaling pathways implicated in the sleep circuit include cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and epidermal growth factor receptor-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (EGFR-ERK) signaling pathways that operate on different neural substrates.

Valeriana officinalis attenuates the rotenone-induced toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster,23639798,10.1016/j.neuro.2013.04.006,"In this study, we investigated the potential protective effects of Valeriana officinalis (V. officinalis) against the toxicity induced by rotenone in Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster). Adult wild-type flies were concomitantly exposed to rotenone (500 Î¼M) and V. officinalis aqueous extract (10mg/mL) in the food during 7 days. Rotenone-fed flies had a worse performance in the negative geotaxis assay (i.e. climbing capability) and open-field test (i.e. mobility time) as well as a higher incidence of mortality when compared to control group. V. officinalis treatment offered protection against these detrimental effects of rotenone. In contrast, the decreased number of crossings observed in the flies exposed to rotenone was not modified by V. officinalis. Rotenone toxicity was also associated with a marked decrease on the total-thiol content in the homogenates and cell viability of flies, which were reduced by V. officinalis treatment. Indeed, rotenone exposure caused a significant increase in the mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) and also in the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene.

CaÂ²??calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in the cockroach Periplaneta americana: identification of five isoforms and their tissues distribution,23740573,10.1002/arch.21102,"Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a key kinase that transduces CaÂ²??signals into downstream effects acting on a range of cellular processes in nervous system and muscular tissues. In insects, different CaMKII isoforms have been reported in Drosophila melanogaster, Apis florae, Bombus terrestris, and Bombus impatiens but little is known on the organization and tissue-specific expression of these isoforms with the exception of Drosophila. The present study reports the cloning of five CaMKII splice variants issued from a single gene and their tissue-specific expression in the cockroach Periplaneta americana. Each CaMKII isoform shared 82-90% identity with Drosophila CaMKII isoforms and accordingly were named PaCaMKII-A, PaCaMKII-B,PaCaMKII-C,PaCaMKII-D, and PaCaMKII-E. PaCaMKII-A and PaCaMKII-D isoforms are ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, but some such as PaCaMKII-B andPaCaMKII-C are preferentially expressed in the nerve cord and muscle. In addition, using single-cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we found a tissue-specific expression of PaCaMKII-E in the dorsal unpaired median neurons. Alternative splicing of PaCaMKII transcripts is likely a common mechanism in insects to control the pattern of isoform expression in the different tissues.",2013,"Emiliane Taillebois, Emilie Heuland, CÃ©line M Bourdin, Audrey Griveau, Sophie Quinchard, Helene Tricoire-Leignel, Christian Legros, Steeve H Thany, Emiliane Taillebois, Emilie Heuland, CÃ©line M Bourdin, Audrey Griveau, Sophie Quinchard, Helene Tricoire-Leignel, Christian Legros, Steeve H Thany"

Here we have investigated the transcriptional induction of immune pathway genes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster upon infection with the entomopathogenic (or insect pathogenic) nematodes Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and their mutualistic bacteria Photorhabdus luminescens, either collectively or separately. We show that in most cases, infection of wild-type adult flies with Heterorhabditis nematodes carrying or lacking mutualistic Photorhabdus bacteria results in the up-regulation of genes in the Toll, Imd, JAK/STAT, JNK and TGF-beta pathways. We also find that direct injection of Photorhabdus bacteria into flies fails to induce the transcription of antimicrobial peptide genes and stress-related genes in Drosophila.

Recent data has demonstrated further roles for the JAK/STAT pathway in the establishment of sexual identity via the early embryonic expression of Sex lethal, the segmentation of the embryo via the control of pair rule genes including even skipped and the establishment of polarity within the adult compound eye via a mechanism that includes the four jointed gene. Use of the powerful genetics in the model organism Drosophila may identify new components of the JAK/STAT pathway, define new roles for this pathway, and provide insights into the function of this signal transduction system.

In this study, we allowed mutations to accumulate in an outbred, wild population of Drosophila melanogaster to test for age-specific differences in both male mating ability and fecundity. We assayed for age-specific effects of mutations after 10, 20, and 30 generations of mutation accumulation. For mating ability, we found the strongest effects of mutations in the first half of the life span after 20 generations, and at nearly all ages by generation 30. These results are qualitatively consistent with results from a companion study in which age-specific mortality was assayed on the same lines of D. melanogaster. By contrast, effects of fecundity were confined to late ages after 20 generations of mutation accumulation, but by generation 30, as with male mating ability, effects of novel mutations were distributed across all age classes. We discuss several possible explanations for the differences that we observe between generations within traits, and among traits, and the relevance for these patterns to models of aging as well as models of mate choice and sexual selection.",2000,"P D Mack, V K Lester, D E Promislow, P D Mack, V K Lester, D E Promislow"

Heparin lyases released disaccharides bearing N-, 2-O-, and 6-O-sulfated species, including mono-, di-, and trisulfated forms. We observed tissue- and stage-specific differences in both chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate composition in Drosophila. We have also applied these methods toward the analysis of tout-velu, an EXT-related gene in Drosophila that controls the tissue distribution of the growth factor Hedgehog. The proteins encoded by the vertebrate tumor suppressor genes EXT1 and 2, show heparan sulfate co-polymerase activity, and it has been proposed that tout-velu affects Hedgehog activity via its role in heparan sulfate biosynthesis.

LIS1 is hypothesized to regulate nuclear movement in migrating neurons through interactions with the cytoskeleton, while the alpha-subunits, whose structure is known, contain a trypsin-like triad within the framework of a unique tertiary fold. The physiological significance of the association of the two types of subunits is not known. In an effort to better understand the function of the complex we turned to genomic data mining in search of related proteins in lower eukaryotes. We found that the Drosophila melanogaster genome contains homologs of both alpha- and beta-subunits, and we cloned both genes. The alpha-subunit homolog has been overexpressed, purified and crystallized. It lacks two of the three active-site residues and, consequently, is catalytically inactive against PAF-AH (Ib) substrates.

Multiple roles of Spo11 in meiotic chromosome behavior,10835371,10.1093/emboj/19.11.2739,"Spo11, a type II topoisomerase, is likely to be required universally for initiation of meiotic recombination. However, a dichotomy exists between budding yeast and the animals Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster with respect to additional roles of Spo11 in meiosis. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Spo11 is required for homolog pairing, as well as axial element (AE) and synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. All of these functions are Spo11 independent in C.elegans and D.melanogaster. We examined Spo11 function in a multicellular fungus, Coprinus cinereus. The C.cinereus spo11-1 mutant shows high levels of homolog pairing and occasionally forms full-length AEs, but no SC. In C.cinereus, Spo11 is also required for maintenance of meiotic chromosome condensation and proper spindle formation. Meiotic progression in spo11-1 is aberrant; late in meiosis basidia undergo programmed cell death (PCD). To our knowledge, this is the first example of meiotic PCD outside the animal kingdom. Ionizing radiation can partially rescue spo11-1 for both AE and SC formation and viable spore production, suggesting that the double-strand break function of Spo11 is conserved and is required for these functions.",2000,"M Celerin, S T Merino, J E Stone, A M Menzie, M E Zolan, M Celerin, S T Merino, J E Stone, A M Menzie, M E Zolan"
The effect of different light regimes on adult life span in Drosophila melanogaster is partly mediated through reproductive output,11039916,10.1177/074873000129001477,"The effects of different light regimes on the fitness of organisms have typically been studied using mean or median adult life span as the sole index of physiological well-being. It is, however, known that life span is inversely related to reproductive output in many species. Moreover, the effects of a given environmental treatment on life span can be due to effects on either age-independent mortality or the ""rate of aging,"" or a combination of both. Drawing evolutionary inferences from the effects of light regime on mean or median adult life span alone is difficult and, at best, speculative. We examined the effects of constant light (LL), alternating light-dark cycles (LD 12:12 h), and constant darkness (DD) on the life span of reproducing and virgin flies in four populations of Drosophila melanogaster and also estimated lifetime fecundity in the three light regimes. The light regime effects on life span were further dissected by examining the age-independent mortality and the Gompertz rate of aging under the three light regimes. While mean adult life span of reproducing males and females and virgin females was significantly shorter in LL compared to LD 12:12 h and DD, life-time egg production was highest in LL. Life span of virgin males was not significantly affected by light regime. The rate of aging in reproducing females was higher in LL as compared to DD, whereas age-independent mortality was higher in DD. As reproductive output, especially early in life, is a far more significant contributor to fitness than is life span, our results suggest that the earlier reported deleterious effects of LL on fitness are partly an artifact of examining life span alone, without considering other components of adult fitness that trade off with life span. Our results suggest that detailed investigation of the effects of light regime on the physiological and behavioral processes that accompany reproduction is necessary to fully understand the effects of different light regimes on adult fitness in Drosophila.",2000,"V Sheeba, V K Sharma, K Shubha, M K Chandrashekaran, A Joshi, V Sheeba, V K Sharma, K Shubha, M K Chandrashekaran, A Joshi"

Patterns of variation in the intergenic spacers of ribosomal DNA in Drosophila melanogaster support a model for genetic exchanges during X-Y pairing,10880483,,"Detailed analysis of variation in intergenic spacer (IGS) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of rDNA drawn from natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster has revealed contrasting patterns of homogenization although both spacers are located in the same rDNA unit.

Here, we provide data from the chromosomal distribution of selected IGS length variants, as well as the detailed internal structure of a large number of IGS regions obtained from specific X and Y chromosomes. The variability found in the different internal subrepeat regions of IGS regions isolated from X and Y chromosomes supports the proposed mechanism of genetic exchanges and suggests that only the ""240"" subrepeats are involved. The presence of a putative site for topoisomerase I at the 5' end of the 18S rRNA gene would allow for the exchange between X and Y chromosomes of some 240 subrepeats, the promoter, and the ETS region, leaving the rest of the rDNA unit to evolve along separate chromosomal lineages.

Indy was most abundantly expressed in the fat body, midgut, and oenocytes: the principal sites of intermediary metabolism in the fly.

Although PTGS in Drosophila is typically observed following direct injection of the dsRNA into embryos, it is theoretically possible that the in vivo transcription of an inverted repeat transgene might also produce a dsRNA ""hairpin"" that is capable of triggering PTGS. Here we test this idea, and show that an expressed inverted repeat of a portion of the sex differentiation gene, transformer-2, (tra-2), driven by a GAL4-dependent promoter, does genetically repress the endogenous wild-type tra-2 function, producing a dominant loss-of-function mutant phenotype. Remarkably, this effect is temperature-sensitive, with phenotypic consequences seen at 29 degrees, but not at 22 degrees.

In a homologous in vitro system, we demonstrated that B52 complements a Drosophila S100 extract to allow splicing of a Drosophila fushi tarazu (ftz) mini-pre-mRNA. Moreover, Kc cell nuclear extracts that were immunodepleted of B52 lost their ability to splice this ftz pre-mRNA. In contrast, splicing of this same ftz pre-mRNA occurred in whole larvae homozygous for the B52 deletion. Other SR protein family members isolated from these larvae could substitute for B52 splicing activity in vitro. We also observed that SR proteins are expressed variably in different larval tissues. B52 is the predominant SR protein in specific tissues, including the brain. Tissues in which B52 is normally the major SR protein, such as larval brain tissue, failed to produce ftz mRNA in the B52 deletion line.

No consensus TATA or CAAT sequences are located at canonical positions, although an AT-rich sequence was identified flanking the major transcriptional initiation site. Northern analyses indicated that the mtSSB transcript is present at variable levels throughout development. In situ hybridization analysis shows that maternally deposited mtSSB mRNA is distributed homogeneously in the early embryo, whereas de novo transcript is produced specifically at an elevated level in the developing midgut. Transfection assays in cultured Schneider cells with promoter region deletion constructs revealed that the proximal 230 nucleotides contain cis-acting elements required for efficient gene expression. Putative transcription factor binding sites clustered within this region include two Drosophila DNA replication-related elements (DRE) and a single putative E2F binding site. Deletion and base substitution mutagenesis of the DRE sites demonstrated that they are required for efficient promoter activity, and gel electrophoretic mobility shift analyses showed that DRE binding factor (DREF) binds to these sites.

Developmental dynamics of peripheral glia in Drosophila melanogaster,10719354,10.1002/(sici)1098-1136(200004)30:2<122::aid-glia2>3.0.co;2-b,"To study the roles of peripheral glia in nervous system development, a thorough characterization of wild type glial development must first be performed. We present a developmental profile of peripheral glia in Drosophila melanogaster that includes glial genesis, developmental morphology, the establishment of transient cellular contacts, migration patterns, and the extent of nerve wrapping in the embryonic and larval stages. In early embryonic development, immature peripheral glia that are born in the CNS seem to be intermediate targets for neurites that are migrating into the periphery. During migration to the PNS, peripheral glia follow the routes of pioneer neurons. The glia preferentially adhere to sensory axonal projections, extending cytoplasmic processes along them such that by the end of embryogenesis peripheral glial coverage of the sensory system is complete. In contrast, significant lengths of motor branch termini are unsheathed in the mature embryo. During larval stages however, peripheral glia further extend and elaborate their cytoplasmic processes until they often reach to the neuromuscular junction. Throughout the embryonic and larval developmental stages, we have also observed a number of similarities of peripheral glia to vertebrate Schwann cells and astrocytes. Peripheral glia seem to have dynamic and diverse roles and their similarities to vertebrate glia suggest that Drosophila may serve as a powerful tool for analysis of glial roles in PNS development in the future.",2000,"K J Sepp, J Schulte, V J Auld, K J Sepp, J Schulte, V J Auld"
The role of male accessory gland protein Acp36DE in sperm competition in Drosophila melanogaster,10885514,10.1098/rspb.2000.1114,"A crucial factor determining sperm fertilization success in multiply mated Drosophila melanogaster females is the efficiency with which sperm are stored. This process is modulated by the accessory gland protein Acp36DE. In this study, we show that the effect of Acp36DE on sperm storage itself alters the outcome of sperm competition. As second-mating males, Acp36DE1 (null) males had significantly lower P2-values than Acp36DE2 (truncation) or Acp36DE+ (control) males, as might be expected as the null males' sperm are poorly stored. We used spermless males, which are null for Acp36DE, to show that, in the absence of sperm co-transfer, Acp36DE itself could not displace first-male sperm. The results therefore suggest that males null for Acp36DE suffer in sperm displacement because fewer sperm are stored or retained, not because Acp36DE itself displaces sperm. Acp36DE1 (null) males also gained significantly fewer fertilizations than controls when they were the first males to mate. Using spermless males, we also showed that significantly more second-male offspring were produced following the transfer of Acp36DE by spermless first-mating males. This implies that the transfer of Acp36DE itself by the first male facilitated the storage or use of the second male's sperm and that co-transfer with sperm is not necessary for Acp36DE effects on second-male sperm storage. Acp36DE may persist in the reproductive tract and aid the storage of any sperm including those of later-mating males or prime the female for future efficient sperm storage. Our results indicate that mutations in genes that affect sperm storage can drastically affect the outcome of sperm competition.",2000,"T Chapman, D M Neubaum, M F Wolfner, L Partridge, T Chapman, D M Neubaum, M F Wolfner, L Partridge"
"Associations between female remating behavior, oogenesis and oviposition in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura",10891578,10.1016/s0022-1910(00)00074-3,"An association between female remating behavior, oogenesis and oviposition was examined in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura to investigate mechanisms that elicit remating. Females receptive to remating oviposited more eggs in both species; however, the species differed in the association between remating behavior and the number and distribution of oocyte stages. We found no differences in the number of either developing eggs of different stages or mature eggs between female D. pseudoobscura that were either receptive or nonreceptive to remating. In contrast, D. melanogaster females that are receptive to remating had significantly more mature eggs in the ovaries than nonreceptive females. Nonremating females had a significantly greater number of immature, vitellogenic oocytes. These results suggest that factors associated with oogenesis are related to female remating behavior in D. melanogaster but not in D. pseudoobscura. We discuss these results in conjunction with other evidence on the role male ejaculatory components play in mediating female remating behavior.",2000,"RR Snook, YK So"
Reverse transcriptase can stabilize or destabilize the genome,11195348,,"Telomeres, the eukaryotic chromosome termini, are deoxyribonucleoprotein structures that distinguish natural chromosome ends from broken DNA. In most organisms, telomeres are extended by a reverse transcriptase (RT) with an integrated RNA template, telomerase; in Drosophila melanogaster, however, telomere-specific retrotransposons, HeT-A and TART transpose specifically to chromosome ends. Whether telomeres are extended by a telomerase or by retrotransposons, an RT is a key component. RT has been studied extensively, both for its important role in converting RNA genomes to DNA, which has great evolutionary impact, and as a therapeutic target in human retroviral diseases. Here we discuss a few important aspects of RT usage during retrotransposition and telomere elongation.",2000,"A Haoudi, J M Mason, A Haoudi, J M Mason"
A proteomics approach to the identification of mammalian mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal proteins,10938081,10.1074/jbc.M003596200,"Mammalian mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal proteins were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins in six individual spots were subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion. Peptides were separated by capillary liquid chromatography, and the sequences of selected peptides were obtained by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The peptide sequences obtained were used to screen human expressed sequence tag data bases, and complete consensus cDNAs were assembled. Mammalian mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal proteins from six different classes of ribosomal proteins were identified. Only two of these proteins have significant sequence similarities to ribosomal proteins from prokaryotes. These proteins correspond to Escherichia coli S10 and S14. Homologs of two human mitochondrial proteins not found in prokaryotes were observed in the genomes of Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. A homolog of one of these proteins was observed in D. melanogaster but not in C. elegans, while a homolog of the other was present in C. elegans but not in D. melanogaster. A homolog of one of the ribosomal proteins not found in prokaryotes was tentatively identified in the yeast genome.

Cloning and functional characterization of a putative sodium channel auxiliary subunit gene from the house fly (Musca domestica),10802239,10.1016/s0965-1748(00)00019-9,"The functional expression of cloned Drosophila melanogaster and house fly (Musca domestica) voltage-sensitive sodium channels in Xenopus oocytes is enhanced, and the inactivation kinetics of the expressed channels are accelerated, by coexpression with the tipE protein, a putative sodium channel auxiliary subunit encoded by the tipE gene of D. melanogaster. These results predict the existence of a tipE ortholog in the house fly. Using a PCR-based homology probing approach, we isolated cDNA clones encoding an ortholog of tipE (designated Vssc beta) from adult house fly heads. Clones comprising 3444 bp of cDNA sequence contained a 1317 bp open-reading frame encoding a 438 amino acid protein. The predicted Vssc beta protein exhibited 72% amino acid sequence identity to the entire D. melanogaster tipE protein sequence and 97% identity within the two hydrophobic segments identified as probable transmembrane domains. Coexpression of Vssc beta with the house fly sodium channel alpha subunit (Vssc1) in oocytes enhanced the level of sodium current expression five-fold and accelerated the rate of sodium current inactivation 2.2-fold. Both of these effects were significantly larger in magnitude than the corresponding effects of the D. melanogaster tipE protein on the expression and kinetics of Vssc1 sodium channels. These results identify a second example of a putative sodium channel auxiliary subunit from an insect having functional but not structural homology to vertebrate sodium channel beta subunits.",2000,"S H Lee, T J Smith, P J Ingles, D M Soderlund, S H Lee, T J Smith, P J Ingles, D M Soderlund"
Molecular population genetics of male accessory gland proteins in Drosophila,11102381,,"Drosophila seminal proteins have an unusually high rate of molecular sequence evolution, suggesting either a high rate of neutral substitution or rapid adaptive evolution. To further quantify patterns of polymorphism and divergence in genes encoding seminal proteins, also called accessory gland proteins (Acp's), we conducted a sequencing survey of 10 Acp genes in samples of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans (Acp29AB, Acp32CD, Acp33A, Acp36DE, Acp53Ea, Acp62F, Acp63F, Acp76A, Acp95EF, and Acp98AB). Mean heterozygosity at replacement sites in D. simulans was 0.0074 for Acp genes and 0.0013 for a set of 19 non-Acp genes, and mean melanogaster-simulans divergence at replacement sites was 0.0497 for Acp genes and 0.0107 at non-Acp genes. The elevated divergence of Acp genes is thus accompanied by elevated within-species polymorphism. In addition to the already-reported departures of Acp26A, Acp29AB, and Acp70A from neutrality, our data reject neutrality at Acp29AB and Acp36DE in the direction of excess replacements in interspecific comparisons.",2000,"D J Begun, P Whitley, B L Todd, H M Waldrip-Dail, A G Clark, D J Begun, P Whitley, B L Todd, H M Waldrip-Dail, A G Clark"
Genomic structure and chromosomal localization of human thioredoxin-like protein gene (txl),10826702,10.3109/10425170009015613,"Human thioredoxin-like protein (txl) is a novel member of the expanding thioredoxin superfamily whose main characteristic is the presence, after the thioredoxin domain, of a C-terminal extension of 184 residues with no homology with any other protein in the databases. Txl is a cytosolic ubiquitously expressed protein and it has been copurified with a kinase of the STE20 family, which is proteolytically activated by caspases in apoptosis. However, no cellular function has yet been assigned to this protein. In the present study we report the genomic organization of the txl gene which encompasses approximately 36 kb organized in eight exons ranging from 96 bp to 303 bp. In contrast, intron sizes are much bigger ranging from 1.5 kb to 12 kb. Chromosomal localization of txl gene revealed that it maps at position 18q21, a region frequently affected in different human tumours. Furthermore, we have identified the putative homologues of txl in both Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans that display much closer homology to the known thioredoxins than the human txl protein. Indeed, critical residues for optimal thioredoxin activity are present in both Drosophila and Caenorhabditis txl but absent in the human protein suggesting that txl might have evolved to carry out a function different from the general disulfide reductase typical of thioredoxins.",2000,"A Miranda-Vizuete, G Spyrou, A Miranda-Vizuete, G Spyrou"

In all traits, both phenotypic and environmental variances increased at 32 degrees C. For genetic variances, only two statistically significant differences between temperature treatments were found: the among-sire variance of viability and the among-dam variance of developmental time were higher under stress. Among-sire genetic variances and evolvabilities were generally higher at 32 degrees C but narrow sense heritabilities were not.

Mega-introns in the dynein gene DhDhc7(Y) on the heterochromatic Y chromosome give rise to the giant threads loops in primary spermatocytes of Drosophila hydei,10655227,,"The heterochromatic Y chromosomes of several Drosophila species harbor a small number of male fertility genes (fertility factors) with several unusual features. Expression of their megabase-sized loci is restricted to primary spermatocytes and correlates with the unfolding of species-specific lampbrush loop-like structures resulting from huge transcripts mainly derived from clusters of loop-specific Y chromosomal satellites. Otherwise, there is evidence from genetic mapping and biochemical experiments that at least two of these loops, Threads in Drosophila hydei and kl-5 in D. melanogaster, colocalize with the genes for the axonemal dynein beta heavy chain proteins DhDhc7(Y) and Dhc-Yh3, respectively. Here, we make use of particular Threads mutants with megabase-sized deletions for direct mapping of DhDhc7(Y)-specific exons among the large clusters of satellite DNA within the 5.1-Mb Threads transcription unit. PCR experiments with exon-specific primer pairs, in combination with hybridization experiments with exon- and satellite-specific probes on filters with large PFGE-generated DNA fragments, offer a simple solution for the long-lasting paradox between megabase-sized loops and protein-encoding transcription units; the lampbrush loops Threads and the DhDhc7(Y) gene are one and the same transcription unit, and the giant size of the DhDhc7(Y) gene as well as its appearance as a giant lampbrush loop are merely the result of transcription of huge clusters of satellite DNA within some of its 20 introns.",2000,"A M Reugels, R Kurek, U Lammermann, H BÃ¼nemann, A M Reugels, R Kurek, U Lammermann, H BÃ¼nemann"

Impact of DNA nucleotide excision repair on methyl methanesulfonate-induced mutations in Drosophila melanogaster,7689038,10.1093/carcin/14.8.1585,"To study the impact of DNA nucleotide excision repair (NER) on the spectrum of mutations induced by alkylating agents, postmeiotic male germ cell stages of Drosophila melanogaster were exposed to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and the males then mated with nucleotide excision repair deficient (exr-; mus(2)201) females. MMS (s value = 0.86) has a strong preference for alkylating the nitrogen positions in DNA, whereas < 1% of all DNA lesions are on oxygen. For genetic and molecular analysis of the types of mutations induced by MMS the vermilion locus was used as target gene. Mutation induction by MMS was increased 10-fold under the exr- conditions compared to a normal functioning repair system. The genetic analysis showed that < 15% of the mutants represented inter-locus mutations, which were classified as multi-locus deletions. Of the intra-locus mutations (18 F1 and 8 F2 mutants) 78% were transversions with a clear dominance of AT-->TA (11 in the F1, 3 in the F2) and few GC-->TA (2 in the F1, 3 in the F2) type of transversions. In comparison to the MMS spectrum produced under repair proficient (exr+) condition (Nivard, M.J.M., Pastink, A. and Vogel, E.W., 1992), the exr- spectrum shows a significant decrease in the percentage of deletions and a relative increase in transversions. These data are consistent with previously published papers suggesting that under normal repair conditions the nitrogen DNA adducts are efficiently repaired in Drosophila and that the hypermutability of MMS in the exr- strain is caused by an increased formation of apurinic sites either formed from 3-methyladenine or 7-methylguanine. This suggests that also in Drosophila 'the A-rule' is valid, indicating that during DNA replication an adenine (A) is preferentially incorporated opposite to non-instructive apurinic sites.",1993,"M J Nivard, A Pastink, E W Vogel, M J Nivard, A Pastink, E W Vogel"
Isolation and characterisation of murine homologues of the Drosophila seven in absentia gene (sina),8404535,,"The seven in absentia gene (sina) is required for formation of the R7 photoreceptor cell in the developing eye of Drosophila melanogaster.

The Siah genes fall into two main groups: Siah-1, which consists of four closely related members, two of which appear to be functional, and Siah-2, which contains a single functional member. The predicted Siah proteins show an unusually high degree of conservation with sina over the majority of their lengths, diverging significantly only at their amino terminal ends. The Siah-1 and Siah-2 genes are widely expressed at a low level in the embryo and adult. Analysis of Siah-2 by hybridisation histochemistry shows that it is expressed at a higher level in a restricted number of sites during development, including the olfactory epithelium, retina, forebrain and proliferating cartilage of developing bone. The striking degree of sequence homology observed between the Drosophila and murine genes implies strong conservation pressure on the Siah genes and suggests that they play a significant role in vertebrate development.",1993,"N G Della, P V Senior, D D Bowtell, N G Della, P V Senior, D D Bowtell"

Position-effect variegation and z1 mediated white repression in the In(1)wis system in Drosophila melanogaster,8144360,10.1111/j.1601-5223.1993.00209.x,"We have characterized a new X-chromosomal inversion in Drosophila melanogaster, extending from just distal of white to just proximal of the bb locus. The inversion places the w-isoxanthopterinless (wis) allele close to heterochromatin and under the influence of position-effect variegation (PEV). The wis gene activity is also regulated by chromosome pairing-dependent z1-mediated repression. By changing the environment, using specific second site modifiers, altering the amount of heterochromatin, and disturbing the chromosome pairing, we have been able to separately affect the two regulatory phenomena and analyse their respective impact on the wis regulation. We provide evidence that under normal conditions PEV and z1 mediated white repression are additive. However, at extreme levels of wis repression by PEV, changes in the z1-mediated interactions are not observable. This indicates that PEV is epistatic to z1-mediated regulation of wis. We also show that deficiencies in the short arm of Y act as suppressors of the z1-mediated white repression. This suppression does not influence PEV and is thus not due to the lower amount of heterochromatin. We propose that nonhomologous chromosome pairing between X and Y is important for the synapsis-dependent z1-mediated repression of white transcription activity in this system.",1993,"A Rasmuson-Lestander, J Larsson, B Rasmuson, A Rasmuson-Lestander, J Larsson, B Rasmuson"

Biochemically, acid phosphatase shows peak activity in the glands of feeding larvae, followed by a marked decline. Directly preceding the onset of cell histolysis however, enzyme activity increases 1.5 fold and is maintained at this level. Histochemically, acid phosphatase activity initially appears as discrete point or lysosomal sources. As development proceeds, an intense and diffuse form of enzyme is seen, accompanying an extremely vacuolated cytoplasm. Ultrastructurally, the enzyme is located in lysosomes, Golgi elements, multivesicular bodies and both within, and on the extracisternal surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This extracisternal or cytosolic form appears directly preceding cell lysis and eventually shows a comprehensive cellular distribution. Large numbers of acid phosphatase positive haemocytes are attached to the basal glandular surface at all developmental stages.

The genomic organization of HeT-A retroposons in Drosophila melanogaster,8391971,10.1007/BF00661272,"Members of the Drosophila HeT-A family of transposable elements are LINE-like retroposons that are found at telomeres and in centric heterochromatin. We recently characterized an active HeT-A element that had transposed to a broken chromosome end fewer than nine generations before it was isolated. The sequence arrangement of this element, called 9D4, most likely represents the organization of an actively transposing member of the HeT-A family. Here we assess the degree of divergence among members of the HeT-A family and test a model of telomere length maintenance based on HeT-A transposition. The region containing the single open reading frame of this element appears to be more highly conserved than the non-coding regions. The HeT-A element has been implicated in the Drosophila telomere elongation process, because frequent transpositions to chromosome ends are sufficient to counter-balance nucleotide loss due to incomplete DNA replication. The proposed elongation model and the hypothetical mechanism of HeT-A transposition predict a predominant orientation of HeT-A elements with their oligo (A) tails facing proximally at chromosome ends, as well as the existence of irregular tandem arrays of HeT-A elements at chromosome ends resulting from transposition of new HeT-A elements onto chromosome ends with existing elements. Twenty-nine different HeT-A fragments were isolated from directional libraries that were enriched in terminal DNA fragments. Sequence analyses of these fragments and comparisons with the organization of the HeT-A element, 9D4, fit these two predictions and support the model of Drosophila telomere elongation by transposition of HeT-A elements.",1993,"H Biessmann, B Kasravi, K Jakes, T Bui, K Ikenaga, J M Mason, H Biessmann, B Kasravi, K Jakes, T Bui, K Ikenaga, J M Mason"

The interaction of D-SSB with ssDNA was examined by the quenching of intrinsic protein fluorescence. The binding site size was determined to be n = 22 +/- 4 nucleotides with a maximum quenching Qm = 35 +/- 3%. Equilibrium titrations indicate that D-SSB binds with low cooperativity, omega = 10-300, and high apparent affinity, K omega = (0.7-5) x 10(7) M-1, at 225 mM NaCl. Sedimentation of D-SSB bound to small oligonucleotides demonstrates that D-SSB does not require protein association for binding.

We found here that the homologous translocation in Y chromosome led to double decrease of the frequency of the mutagenesis in males. It is proposed that interconnections between two homologous insertions are essential in the recombinational processes by which alleles change. The nature and mechanism of the sub-lethal allele's formation in the presence of translocation in Y chromosome is discussed.",1993,"O V Okladnova, O V Okladnova"
A GATA family transcription factor is expressed along the embryonic dorsoventral axis in Drosophila melanogaster,7916677,,"The GATA transcription factors are a family of C4 zinc finger-motif DNA-binding proteins that play defined roles in hematopoiesis as well as presumptive roles in other tissues where they are expressed (e.g., testis, neuronal and placental trophoblast cells) during vertebrate development. To investigate the possibility that GATA proteins may also be involved in Drosophila development, we have isolated and characterized a gene (dGATAa) encoding a factor that is quite similar to mammalian GATA factors. The dGATAa protein sequence contains the two zinc finger DNA-binding domain of the GATA class but bears no additional sequence similarity to any of the vertebrate GATA factors. Analysis of dGATAa gene transcription during Drosophila development revealed that its mRNA is expressed at high levels during early embryogenesis, with transcripts first appearing in the dorsal portion of the embryo just after cellularization. As development progresses, dGATAa mRNA is present at high levels in the dorsal epidermis, suggesting that dGATAa may be involved in determining dorsal cell fate. The pattern of expression in a variety of dorsoventral polarity mutants indicates that dGATAa lies downstream of the zygotic patterning genes decapentaplegic and zerknÃ¼llt.",1993,"J Winick, T Abel, M W Leonard, A M Michelson, I Chardon-Loriaux, R A Holmgren, T Maniatis, J D Engel, J Winick, T Abel, M W Leonard, A M Michelson, I Chardon-Loriaux, R A Holmgren, T Maniatis, J D Engel"

Cloning of a putative GABAA receptor from cyclodiene-resistant Drosophila: a case study in the use of insecticide-resistant mutants to isolate neuroreceptors,8380730,10.1007/978-3-0348-7265-2_9,"This chapter uses the isolation and cloning of cyclodiene resistance from Drosophila melanogaster to illustrate how mutants resistant to a toxicant can be used to study neuroreceptors. Isolation of mutants from the field, mapping of the single gene responsible and its subsequent cloning are described. As confirmation of gene cloning a susceptible allele of the gene has been used to genetically transform resistant individuals to susceptibility. The gene product appears to code for a subunit of a receptor highly similar to vertebrate GABAA receptor/chloride ion channels, and functional expression studies are described which will elucidate its pharmacology. Cyclodiene resistance is extremely widespread, occurring in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Thus examination of resistance-associated mutations in this receptor in a range of species will enhance our understanding of both the binding sites of toxic ligands and the genetic basis of pesticide resistance.",1993,"R H ffrench-Constant, R H ffrench-Constant"
Genetic and biochemical analysis of glutathione-S-transferase in the oxygen defense system of Drosophila melanogaster,8112568,10.1139/g93-134,"Aerobic organisms possess an array of enzymatic defense mechanisms against the toxic effects of active oxygen species. These include CuZn superoxide dismutase (CuZn SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPOX). Insects, however, lack an independent GPOX enzyme and instead rely on the activity of the more general detoxification enzyme, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), to carry out a peroxidase function. We report here the developmental profile of GST in Drosophila melanogaster and show that GST is induced by paraquat, a known free-radical generating agent. We also report that glutathione (GSH) depletion induced by administration of buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) selectively reduces the viability of mutants lacking CuZnSOD. By measuring GST specific activity in flies carrying deficiencies for the 87B region, we confirm an earlier report that this region contains active GST-encoding genes.

Conditional expression of wild-type topoisomerase II complements a mutant enzyme in mammalian cells,8390979,,"Alterations in the amino acid composition, phosphorylation pattern, or intracellular levels of topoisomerase II have been associated with resistance to antineoplastic agents whose effects are mediated through interactions with this enzyme. To develop a model system with which to investigate the determinants of topoisomerase II sensitivity or resistance to antineoplastic agents that target this enzyme, a cDNA encoding the wild-type Drosophila melanogaster topoisomerase II was ligated into a mammalian expression vector containing a glucocorticoid-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter and transfected into an epipodophyllotoxin-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell line (VPM(r)-5). In two transfectants carrying an intact, full-length Drosophila topoisomerase II cDNA, exposure to the inducing agent, dexamethasone (10 microM), resulted in complementation of the endogenous mutant topoisomerase II and phenotypic reversion to etoposide sensitivity. In the presence of glucocorticoid, etoposide-induced cytotoxicity increased 20-fold, despite the fact that Drosophila topoisomerase II mRNA expression was only 0.1% of that of the endogenous mammalian topoisomerase II. Induced cells demonstrated a marked increase in DNA single strand breaks compared with uninduced resistant cells, thereby providing biochemical evidence supporting increased DNA strand cleavage due to activation of the Drosophila enzyme. These observations demonstrate the ability of a wild-type Drosophila topoisomerase II to complement a mutant mammalian enzyme and suggest that transfectants capable of conditional topoisomerase II expression represent a useful model for studies of the biochemical pharmacology and structure-function relationships of normal and mutant enzymes.",1993,"J P Eder Jr, V T Chan, E Niemierko, B A Teicher, L E Schnipper, J P Eder Jr, V T Chan, E Niemierko, B A Teicher, L E Schnipper"
Drosophila wing melanin patterns form by vein-dependent elaboration of enzymatic prepatterns,10607562,10.1016/s0960-9822(00)80083-4,"Background:
      
    

    
      Animal melanin patterns are involved in diverse aspects of their ecology, from thermoregulation to mimicry. Many theoretical models have simulated pigment patterning, but little is known about the developmental mechanisms of color pattern formation. In Drosophila melanogaster, several genes are known to be necessary for cuticular melanization, but the involvement of these genes in melanin pattern evolution is unknown. We have taken a genetic approach to elucidate the developmental mechanisms underlying melanin pattern formation in various drosophilids.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We show that, in D. melanogaster, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopa decarboxylase (DDC) are required for melanin synthesis. Ectopic expression of TH, but not DDC, alone was sufficient to cause ectopic melanin patterns in the wing. Thus, changes in the level of expression of a single gene can result in a new level of melanization. The ontogeny of this ectopic melanization resembled that found in Drosophila species bearing wing melanin patterns and in D. melanogaster ebony mutants. Importantly, we discovered that in D. melanogaster and three other Drosophila species these wing melanin patterns are dependent upon and shaped by the circulation patterns of hemolymph in the wing veins.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Complex wing melanin patterns are determined by two distinct developmental mechanisms. Spatial prepatterns of enzymatic activity are established late in wing development. Then, in newly eclosed adults, melanin precursors gradually diffuse out from wing veins and are oxidized into dark brown or black melanin. Both the prepatterning and hemolymph-supplied components of this system can change during evolution to produce color pattern diversity.",1999,"J R True, K A Edwards, D Yamamoto, S B Carroll, J R True, K A Edwards, D Yamamoto, S B Carroll"
Variation in morphological traits of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) under nutritional stress,10098267,10.1038/sj.hdy.6884660,"The effect of nutritional stress on phenotypical and genetic variation was examined for five morphological traits (thorax length, wing length, sternopleural chaeta number, abdominal chaeta number and arista branch number) in 30 isofemale lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Phenotypical variation of all traits except sternopleural chaeta number and fluctuating asymmetry of all bilateral traits were significantly higher in flies reared under poor feeding conditions. Estimates of isofemale line heritability (coefficients of intraclass correlation) did not show a consistent pattern among traits. However, additive genetic variance was generally higher in poor feeding conditions in all traits except sternopleural chaeta number, although these differences were not statistically significant. Similarly, estimates of evolvability were higher under nutritional stress for all traits except sternopleural chaeta number. These results suggest that nutritional stress increases the expression of genetic variation for some morphological traits in Drosophila and, in this respect, is similar to the effects of temperature stress studied previously.",1999,"A G Imasheva, D V Bosenko, O A Bubli, A G Imasheva, D V Bosenko, O A Bubli"

Tissue-specific expression of dominant negative mutant Drosophila HSC70 causes developmental defects and lethality,10397752,10.1091/mbc.10.7.2101,"The Drosophila melanogaster HSC3 and HSC4 genes encode Hsc70 proteins homologous to the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein BiP and the cytoplasmic clathrin uncoating ATPase, respectively. These proteins possess ATP binding/hydrolysis activities that mediate their ability to aid in protein folding by coordinating the sequential binding and release of misfolded proteins. To investigate the roles of HSC3 (Hsc3p) and HSC4 (Hsc4p) proteins during development, GAL4-targeted gene expression was used to analyze the effects of producing dominant negatively acting Hsc3p (D231S, K97S) and Hsc4p (D206S, K71S) proteins, containing single amino acid substitutions in their ATP-binding domains, in specific tissues of Drosophila throughout development. We show that the production of each mutant protein results in lethality over a range of developmental stages, depending on the levels of protein produced and which tissues are targeted. We demonstrate that the functions of both Hsc3p and Hsc4p are required for proper tissue establishment and maintenance. Production of mutant Hsc4p, but not Hsc3p, results in induction of the stress-inducible Hsp70 at normal temperatures. Evidence is presented that lethality is caused by tissue-specific defects that result from a global accumulation of misfolded protein caused by lack of functional Hsc70. We show that both mutant Hsc3ps are defective in ATP-induced substrate release, although Hsc3p(D231S) does undergo an ATP-induced conformational change. We believe that the amino acid substitutions in Hsc3p interfere with the structural coupling of ATP binding to substrate release, and this defect is the basis for the mutant proteins' dominant negative effects in vivo.",1999,"F Elefant, K B Palter, F Elefant, K B Palter"

We investigated this region genetically and molecularly by use of an enhancer trap line (IA5), where the P-element was found to be inserted into the first intron of pan. Screens for imprecise excisions of the P-element were performed, and complementations between new and old established mutant lines were investigated.

The Drosophila heat shock hsr-omega gene: an allele frequency cline detected by quantitative PCR,10555288,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026069,"The hsr-omega gene of Drosophila melanogaster produces RNA products both constitutively and at elevated levels in response to heat stress. A single-nucleotide difference in this gene that has been detected using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) is responsible for an hsr-omegaa/b polymorphism, and selection experiments have indicated an association between the hsr-omegaa allele and susceptibility to heat stress. Since allele frequency estimates for population surveys using PCR and DGGE for single flies would be relatively time-consuming and expensive, we here develop a quantitative competitive-PCR method using mass-grind genomic DNA preparations for this purpose. Geographical and temporal variation of allele frequency at the hsr-omega locus in Australian populations of D. melanogaster are examined. Regular samples from a southern population through a summer season suggested stability of hsr-omegaa frequency. Field populations sampled from a approximately 2,250 km north-south transect along eastern Australia revealed a strong positive association between the frequency of hsr-omegaa and latitude, and marked spatial autocorrelation. Using appropriate analyses, strong association between population differences in hsr-omegaa frequencies and differences in temperature and rainfall measures, after controlling for latitudinal differences, support the idea that the cline in hsr-omegaa frequency may be attributable to some form of climatic selection.",1999,"G McColl, S W McKechnie, G McColl, S W McKechnie"

Interspecific hybridization increases transposition rates of Osvaldo,10406110,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026182,"Several authors have postulated that genetic divergence between populations could result in genomic incompatibilities that would cause an increase in transposition in their hybrids, producing secondary effects such as sterility and therefore starting a speciation process. It has been demonstrated that transposition largely depends on intraspecific hybridization for P, hobo, and I elements in Drosophila melanogaster and for several elements, including long terminal repeat (LTR) and non-LTR retrotransposons, in D. virilis. However, in order to demonstrate the putative effect of transposable elements on speciation, high levels of transposition should also be induced in hybrids between species that could have been originated by this process and that are still able to interbreed. To test this hypothesis, we studied the transposition of the LTR retrotransposon Osvaldo in Drosophila buzzatii-Drosophila koepferae hybrids. We used a simple and robust experimental design, analyzing large samples of single-pair mate offspring, which allowed us to detect new insertions by in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes. In order to compare transposition rates, we also used a stock recently obtained from the field and a highly inbred D. buzzatii strain. Our results show that the transposition rate of Osvaldo is 10(-3) transpositions per element per generation in all nonhybrid samples, very high when compared with those of other transposable elements. In hybrids, the transposition rate was always 10(-2), significantly higher than in nonhybrids. We show that inbreeding has no effect on transposition in the strains used, concluding that hybridization significantly increases the Osvaldo transposition rate.",1999,"M Labrador, M FarrÃ©, F Utzet, A Fontdevila, M Labrador, M FarrÃ©, F Utzet, A Fontdevila"

Truncated RanGAP encoded by the Segregation Distorter locus of Drosophila,10073941,10.1126/science.283.5408.1742,Segregation Distorter (SD) in Drosophila melanogaster is a naturally occurring meiotic drive system in which the SD chromosome is transmitted from SD/SD+ males in vast excess over its homolog owing to the induced dysfunction of SD+-bearing spermatids. The Sd locus is the key distorting gene responsible for this phenotype. A genomic fragment from the Sd region conferred full distorting activity when introduced into the appropriate genetic background by germline transformation. The only functional product encoded by this fragment is a truncated version of the RanGAP nuclear transport protein.

Overexpression of glutathione reductase extends survival in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster under hyperoxia but not normoxia,10506576,10.1096/fasebj.13.13.1733,"The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that overexpression of glutathione reductase in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster increases resistance to oxidative stress and retards the aging process. Transgenic flies were generated by microinjection and subsequent mobilization of a P element construct containing the genomic glutathione reductase gene of Drosophila, with 4 kb upstream and 1.5 kb downstream of the coding region. Transgenic animals stably overexpressed glutathione reductase by up to 100% throughout adult life and under continuous exposure to 100% oxygen or air. Under hyperoxic conditions, overexpressors had increased longevity, decreased accrual of protein carbonyls, and dramatically increased survival rates after recovery from a semi-lethal dose of 100% oxygen. Under normoxic conditions, overexpression of glutathione reductase had no effect on longevity, protein carbonyl content, reduced glutathione, or glutathione disulfide content, although the total consumption of oxygen was slightly decreased. Glutathione reductase activity does not appear to be a rate-limiting factor in anti-aging defenses under normoxic conditions, but it may become a limiting factor when the level of oxidative stress is elevated.",1999,"R J Mockett, R S Sohal, W C Orr, R J Mockett, R S Sohal, W C Orr"

The Canoe protein is necessary in adherens junctions for development of ommatidial architecture in the Drosophila compound eye,10639730,10.1007/s004419900107,"Rhabdomeres of the Drosophila melanogaster canoemisl mutant ommatidia were twisted, branched, and often fused to each other. A considerable proportion of rhabdomeres were found to have fallen below the retinal basement membrane. Electron-microscopic observations of the mutant ommatidia revealed that microvilli, the subcellular structures composing the rhabdome, were normal. As was the case with partial loss-of-function mutations in the canoe locus, overexpression of the wild-type canoe transgene driven by the heat shock promoter or sevenless enhancer in the wild-type canoe background caused malformation of the rhabdomeres in the adult ommatidia. Immunolabeling of the Canoe protein in the pupal retinae showed that it was accumulated in adherens junctions in photoreceptor rhabdomeres at high concentrations, as well as in pigment cells, bristle cells, and the interjunctional region of photoreceptors at a lower level. In the canoe mutant ommatidia, the Canoe protein concentration was dramatically decreased in adherens junctions, while it was maintained at a level comparable with the wild-type flies in the interjunctional region. Since Canoe or its mammalian homolog AF-6 is known to bind to F-actin and Ras, we suggest the possibility that Canoe couples Ras signaling with cytoskeleton, thereby supporting the straight elongation of rhabdomeres required for development of a regular array of ommatidia.",1999,"T Matsuo, K Takahashi, E Suzuki, D Yamamoto, T Matsuo, K Takahashi, E Suzuki, D Yamamoto"
Linkage disequilibrium mapping of molecular polymorphisms at the scabrous locus associated with naturally occurring variation in bristle number in Drosophila melanogaster,10689806,10.1017/s001667239900419x,"We evaluated the hypothesis that the Drosophila melanogaster second chromosome gene scabrous (sca), a candidate sensory bristle number quantitative trait locus (QTL), contributes to naturally occurring variation in bristle number. Variation in abdominal and sternopleural bristle number was quantified for wild-derived sca alleles in seven genetic backgrounds: as homozygous second chromosomes (C2) in an isogenic background, homozygous lines in which approximately 20 cM including the sca locus had been introgressed into the isogenic background (sca BC), as C2 and sca BC heterozygotes and hemizygotes against a P element insertional sca allele and a P-induced sca deficiency in the same isogenic background, and as sca BC heterozygotes against the wild-type sca allele of isogenic strain. Molecular restriction map variation was determined for a 45 kb region including the sca locus, and single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) was examined for the third intron and parts of the third and fourth exons. Associations between each of the 27 molecular polymorphisms and bristle number were evaluated within each genotype and on the first principal component score determined from all seven genotypes, separately for each sex and bristle trait. Permutation tests were used to assess the empirical significance thresholds, accounting for multiple, correlated tests, and correlated markers. Three sites in regulatory regions were associated with female-specific variation in abdominal bristle number, one of which was an SSCP site in the region of the gene associated with regulation of sca in embryonic abdominal segments.",1999,"R F Lyman, C Lai, T F MacKay, R F Lyman, C Lai, T F MacKay"
"Neuronal polymorphism among natural alleles of a cGMP-dependent kinase gene, foraging, in Drosophila",10493773,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.19-19-j0002.1999,"Natural variation in neuronal excitability and connectivity has not been extensively studied. In Drosophila melanogaster, a naturally maintained genetic polymorphism at a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) gene, foraging (for), is associated with alternative food search strategies among the allelic variants Rover (for(R); higher PKG activity) and sitter (for(s); lower PKG activity). We examined physiological and morphological variations in nervous systems of these allelic variants isolated from natural populations. Whole-cell current clamping revealed distinct excitability patterns, with spontaneous activities and excessive evoked firing in cultured sitter, but not Rover, neurons. Voltage-clamp examination demonstrated reduced voltage-dependent K(+) currents in sitter neurons. Focal recordings from synapses at the larval neuromuscular junction demonstrated spontaneous activity and supernumerary discharges with increased transmitter release after nerve stimulation. Immunolabeling showed more diffuse motor axon terminal projections with increased ectopic nerve entry points in sitter larval muscles. The differences between the two natural alleles was enhanced in laboratory-induced mutant alleles of the for gene. The pervasive effects of the for-PKG on neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, and nerve connectivity illustrate the magnitude of neuronal variability in Drosophila that can be attributed to a single gene. These findings establish the consequences in cellular function for natural variation in an isoform of PKG and suggest a role for natural selection in maintaining variation in neuronal properties.",1999,"J J Renger, W D Yao, M B Sokolowski, C F Wu, J J Renger, W D Yao, M B Sokolowski, C F Wu"
The trithorax group gene moira encodes a brahma-associated putative chromatin-remodeling factor in Drosophila melanogaster,9891050,10.1128/mcb.19.2.1159,"The genes of the trithorax group (trxG) in Drosophila melanogaster are required to maintain the pattern of homeotic gene expression that is established early in embryogenesis by the transient expression of the segmentation genes. The precise role of each of the diverse trxG members and the functional relationships among them are not well understood. Here, we report on the isolation of the trxG gene moira (mor) and its molecular characterization. mor encodes a fruit fly homolog of the human and yeast chromatin-remodeling factors BAF170, BAF155, and SWI3. mor is widely expressed throughout development, and its 170-kDa protein product is present in many embryonic tissues. In vitro, MOR can bind to itself and it interacts with Brahma (BRM), an SWI2-SNF2 homolog, with which it is associated in embryonic nuclear extracts. The leucine zipper motif of MOR is likely to participate in self-oligomerization; the equally conserved SANT domain, for which no function is known, may be required for optimal binding to BRM. MOR thus joins BRM and Snf5-related 1 (SNR1), two known Drosophila SWI-SNF subunits that act as positive regulators of the homeotic genes. These observations provide a molecular explanation for the phenotypic and genetic relationships among several of the trxG genes by suggesting that they encode evolutionarily conserved components of a chromatin-remodeling complex.",1999,"M A Crosby, C Miller, T Alon, K L Watson, C P Verrijzer, R Goldman-Levi, N B Zak, M A Crosby, C Miller, T Alon, K L Watson, C P Verrijzer, R Goldman-Levi, N B Zak"
Nonfixed duplication containing the Adh gene and a truncated form of the Adhr gene in the Drosophila funebris species group: different modes of evolution of Adh relative to Adhr in Drosophila,10555275,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026056,"The sequence of the genomic region that contains the Adh and Adhr genes of Drosophila funebris was used to demonstrate that both genes are present in species of the funebris group. The sequence of this genomic region reveals a 2.9-kb tandem duplication which encompasses 1.6 kb of the 5' flanking region, the entire Adh gene, and two thirds of the first exon of the Adhr gene in D. funebris. This duplication is not fixed in this species since some strains do not carry the duplication. The Adh duplication has also been found in another species of the funebris group, Drosophila macrospina macrospina. The sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the Adh gene indicates a single promoter and shows stretches of high similarity with cis-acting elements responsible for the expression of Adh in Drosophila melanogaster. In confirmation of this indication, the larval and adult transcripts have the same length, which corresponds to the transcription from the promoter proximal to the coding region. The codon bias of the Adh gene of D. funebris is among the lowest reported for any Adh gene in the Drosophilidae species and is very similar to that of the Adhr gene. The Adhr gene evolves slightly faster than Adh at synonymous positions. At nonsynonymous positions, the Adh gene evolves 2.5 times faster than Adhr in the species pair D. funebris-Drosophila immigrans, while in other interspecific comparisons the average is about 1.25. However, in comparisons between some species within the melanogaster and obscura groups, Adh evolves at half the rate of Adhr. The phylogenetic trees constructed with the coding region of the Adh gene cluster D. funebris and D. immigrans and clearly separate them from the clade in which virilis, repleta, and Hawaiian species are grouped. Using the evolutionary synonymous rate estimated for Hawaiian species, the divergence time of D. funebris from the virilis-repleta-Hawaiian clade was estimated as 34.3 Myr, and the divergence time of D. funebris and D. immigrans was estimated as 23.5 Myr.",1999,"A Amador, E Juan, A Amador, E Juan"

The newly identified gene, which we named dCRY, was expressed as a recombinant protein and tested for photolyase activity. The recombinant protein exhibited photochemical properties similar to those of Drosophila pyrimidine dimer and (6-4) photolyases but lacked photolyase activity. In light of recent evidence that blue-light photoreceptors regulate the circadian clock in mammals, we propose that dCRY is the circadian photoreceptor in this organism.",1999,"C P Selby, A Sancar, C P Selby, A Sancar"

The NO/cGMP signaling system is thought to play essential roles during the development of vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Here, we analyzed the cellular expression of this signaling pathway during the development of the Drosophila melanogaster nervous system. Using NADPH diaphorase histochemistry as a marker for NO synthase, we identified several neuronal and glial cell types as potential NO donor cells. To label NO-responsive target cells, we used the detection of cGMP by an immunocytochemical technique. Incubation of tissue in an NO donor induced cGMP immunoreactivity (cGMP-IR) in individual motoneurons, sensory neurons, and groups of interneurons of the brain and ventral nerve cord. A dynamic pattern of the cellular expression of NADPHd staining and cGMP-IR was observed during embryonic, larval, and prepupal phases. The expression of NADPH diaphorase and cGMP-IR in distinct neuronal populations of the larval central nervous system (CNS) indicates a role of NO in transcellular signaling within the CNS and as potential retrograde messenger across the neuromuscular junction. In addition, the presence of NADPH diaphorase-positive imaginal discs containing NO-responsive sensory neurons suggests that a transcellular NO/cGMP messenger system can operate between cells of epithelial and neuronal phenotype. The discrete cellular resolution of donor and NO-responsive target cells in identifiable cell types will facilitate the genetic, pharmacological, and physiological analysis of NO/cGMP signal transduction in the developing nervous system of Drosophila.",1999,"B Wildemann, G Bicker, B Wildemann, G Bicker"
Diversity of odourant binding proteins revealed by an expressed sequence tag project on male Manduca sexta moth antennae,10620045,10.1046/j.1365-2583.1999.00146.x,"A small expressed sequence tag (EST) project generating 506 ESTs from 375 cDNAs was undertaken on the antennae of male Manduca sexta moths in an effort to discover olfactory receptor proteins. We encountered several clones that encode apparent transmembrane proteins; however, none is a clear candidate for an olfactory receptor. Instead we found a greater diversity of odourant binding proteins (OBPs) than previously known in moth antennae, raising the number known for M. sexta from three to seven. Together with evidence of seventeen members of the family from the Drosophila melanogaster genome project, our results suggest that insects may have many tens of OBPs expressed in subsets of the chemosensory sensilla on their antennae. These results support a model for insect olfaction in which OBPs selectively transport and present odourants to transmembrane olfactory receptors. We also found five members of a family of shorter proteins, named sensory appendage proteins (SAPs), that might also be involved in odourant transport. This small EST project also revealed several candidate odourant degrading enzymes including three P450 cytochromes, a glutathione S-transferase and a uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucosyltransferase. Several first insect homologues of proteins known from vertebrates, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, yeast and bacteria were encountered, and most have now also been detected by the large D. melanogaster EST project.

Moreover, we found D. grimshawi proteins in the hemolymph and accumulating in ovaries. Using reporter constructs we showed that the intergenic region from D. grimshawi was sufficient to drive accurate expression, but some low level of ectopic expression was seen in males. Transforming D. melanogaster with constructs bearing deletions within the D. grimshawi intergenic region revealed only subtle effects in the overall level of expression, suggesting a high level of redundancy. Testing mutants in the sex-specific regulator doublesex revealed that it is capable of repressing the DgYp genes in males.

These comprised transversely striated muscle (flight muscle) from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, transversely striated muscle (heart muscle) from the snail Helix aspersa, obliquely striated muscle (body wall muscle) from the earthworm Eisenia foetida, smooth muscle (retractor muscle) from H. aspersa, and smooth muscle (outer muscular layer of the pseudoheart) from E. foetida. The study was carried by means of Western blot analysis, ELISA, and immunohistochemical electron microscopy, using anti alpha-actinin antibody. Immunoreaction for a protein with the same molecular weight as that of mammalian alpha-actinin was detected in all muscle types studied, although the amount and intensity of immunoreaction varied among them. In the insect muscle, immunolabelling was found along the whole Z-line. In both the transversely striated muscle from the snail and the obliquely striated muscle from the earthworm, immunolabelling did not occupy the whole Z-line but showed discontinuous, orderly arranged patches along the Z-line course. In the two smooth muscles studied (snail and earthworm), immunolabelling was limited to small patches which did not show an apparently ordered distribution. Since it is assumed that alpha-actinin is located at the anchorage sites for actin filaments, present observations suggest that, only in the Drosophila muscle, actin filaments are parallelly arranged in all their course, whereas in the other invertebrate muscles studied these filaments converge on discontinuously distributed anchorage sites.",1999,"M Royuela, C Astier, B Fraile, R Paniagua, M Royuela, C Astier, B Fraile, R Paniagua"
The trace amine tyramine is essential for sensitization to cocaine in Drosophila,10469593,10.1016/s0960-9822(99)80389-3,"Background:
      
    

    
      Sensitization to psychostimulant drugs of abuse is thought to be an important aspect of human addiction, yet how it develops is still unclear. The development of sensitization to cocaine in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is strikingly similar to that observed in vertebrates. By taking advantage of the powerful genetic approaches that are possible in Drosophila, we are able to identify and characterize mutants that fail to develop sensitization.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We found that the Drosophila mutant inactive (iav) failed to become sensitized to cocaine. Mutant flies had reduced amounts of the trace amine tyramine in the brain because of reduced activity of the enzyme tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC), which converts tyrosine to tyramine. Furthermore, cocaine exposure induced TDC enzyme activity in a time-dependent manner that paralleled the development of behavioral sensitization. The sensitization failure of iav flies could be rescued by feeding the flies with tyramine; other biogenic amines or amine precursors did not have the same effect.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:

Identification of pseudogenes in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,12560500,10.1093/nar/gkg169,"Pseudogenes are copies of genes that cannot produce a protein. They can be detected from disruptions to their apparent coding sequence, caused by frameshifts and premature stop codons. They are classed as either processed pseudogenes (made by reverse transcription from an mRNA) or duplicated pseudogenes, arising from duplication in the genomic DNA and subsequent disablement. Historically, there is anecdotal evidence that the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) has few pseudogenes. Investigators have linked this to a high deletion rate of genomic DNA, for which there is evidence from genetic experiments on genome size. Here, we apply a homology-based pipeline that was developed previously to identify pseudogenes in other eukaryotic genomes, to the fruit fly, so as to derive the first complete survey of its pseudogene population. We find approximately 100 pseudogenes, with at least a sixth of these as candidate processed pseudogenes. This gives a much lower proportion of pseudogenes (compared with the size of the proteome) than in the genomes of other eukaryotes for which data are available (human, nematode and budding yeast). Closest matching proteins to Drosophila pseudogenes are significantly longer than the average protein in its proteome (up to approximately 60% more than the average protein's length), in contrast to the situation in the three other eukaryotic genomes. This may be due to the persistence of fragments of longer genes. In the fly pseudogene population, we found most pseudogenes for serine proteases (which are more abundant in the Drosophila lineage compared with the other eukaryotes), immunoglobulin-motif-containing proteins and cytochromes P450. Data on the sequences and positions of the putative pseudogenes are available at: http://www.pseudogene.org/fly. The detection of a small number of pseudogenes in the Drosophila genome and the higher mean length for the closest matching proteins to pseudogenes (possibly because remnants of genes encoding longer proteins are more likely to persist) are further evidence for a high deletion rate of genomic DNA in the fruit fly. The data are useful for molecular evolution study in Drosophila.",2003,"Paul M Harrison, Duncan Milburn, Zhaolei Zhang, Paul Bertone, Mark Gerstein, Paul M Harrison, Duncan Milburn, Zhaolei Zhang, Paul Bertone, Mark Gerstein"
Alternative splicing of lola generates 19 transcription factors controlling axon guidance in Drosophila,12897787,10.1038/nn1105,"The Drosophila melanogaster transcription factor Lola (longitudinals lacking) is a pivotal regulator of neural wiring that sets the precise expression levels of proteins that execute specific axon guidance decisions. Lola has a zinc finger DNA binding domain and a BTB (for Broad-complex, Tramtrack and Bric a brac) dimerization motif. We now show that alternative splicing of the lola gene creates a family of 19 transcription factors. All lola isoforms share a common dimerization domain, but 17 have their own unique DNA-binding domains. Seven of these 17 isoforms are present in the distantly-related Dipteran Anopheles gambiae, suggesting that the properties of specific isoforms are likely to be critical to lola function. Analysis of the expression patterns of individual splice variants and of the phenotypes of mutants lacking single isoforms supports this idea and establishes that the alternative forms of lola are responsible for different functions of this gene. Thus, in this system, the alternative splicing of a key transcription factor helps to explain how a small genome encodes all the information that is necessary to specify the enormous diversity of axonal trajectories.",2003,"Scott Goeke, Elizabeth A Greene, Paul K Grant, Michael A Gates, Daniel Crowner, Toshiro Aigaki, Edward Giniger, Scott Goeke, Elizabeth A Greene, Paul K Grant, Michael A Gates, Daniel Crowner, Toshiro Aigaki, Edward Giniger"

Quantitative genetic tests of recent senescence theory: age-specific mortality and male fertility in Drosophila melanogaster,13130305,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800353,"Quantitative genetic models of aging predict that additive genetic variance for fitness components should increase with age. However, recent studies have found that at very late ages, the genetic variance components decline. This decline may be due to an age-related drop in reproductive effort. If genetic variance in reproductive effort affects the genetic variance in mortality, the decline in reproductive effort at late ages should lead to a decrease in the genetic variance in mortality. To test this, we carried out a large-scale quantitative genetic analysis of age-specific mortality and fertility in virgin male Drosophila melanogaster. As in earlier studies, we found that the additive variance for age-specific mortality and fertility declined at late ages. Also, recent theoretical developments provide new predictions to distinguish between the mutation accumulation (MA) and antagonistic pleiotropy (AP) models of senescence. The deleterious effects of inbreeding are expected to increase with age under MA, but not under AP. This prediction was supported for both age-specific mortality and male fertility. Under AP, the ratio of dominance to additive variance is expected to decline with age. This predicition, too, was supported by the data analyzed here. Taken together, these analyses provide support for both the models playing a role in the aging process. We argue that the time has come to move beyond a simple comparison of these genetic models, and to think more deeply about the evolutionary causes and consequences of senescence.",2003,"M S Snoke, D E L Promislow, M S Snoke, D E L Promislow"

We have revisited the Ras/Rap-Ral connections in Drosophila melanogaster by using iterative two-hybrid screens with these three GTPases as primary baits and a subsequent genetic approach. We show that (i) the Ral-centered protein network appears to be extremely conserved in human and flies, (ii) in this network, RGL is a functional Drosophila orthologue of RalGEFs, and (iii) the RGL-Ral pathway functionally interacts with both the Ras and Rap pathways. Our data do not support the paradigmatic model where Ral is in the effector pathway of Ras.

Variable effects of vitamin E on Drosophila longevity,12766533,10.1023/a:1023347803932,"Vitamin E has been used widely in invertebrate experiments where it usually acts to prolong life span. Conversely in vertebrates it has been less successful. In some cases, experiments in rodents show no effect of vitamin E on longevity. Consequently, the suggestion has been made that anti-oxidants do not effect ageing in vertebrates. In more extensive experiments with Drosophila melanogaster, vitamin E exerted both life span extending and toxic effects. At 20 micro g/ml, the life span was increased by 16%, although there was no effect at higher or lower concentrations. At 200 micro g/ml, vitamin E protected Drosophila against paraquat toxicity. At this concentration, vitamin E had no effect on longevity in one set of experiments, and shortened the life span in another set. Apparent toxicity of vitamin E was also observed in behavior experiments. We suggest that inactivity of vitamin E that has been reported by some authors is due to antagonistic actions of a toxic effect and a beneficial anti-oxidant action.

DmTrxR-1 belongs to the family of dimeric, high Mr thioredoxin reductases, which catalyze reduction of thioredoxin by NADPH. Thioredoxin reductase has an N-terminal redox-active disulfide (Cys57-Cys62) adjacent to the flavin and a redox-active C-terminal cysteine pair (Cys489'-Cys490' in the other subunit) that transfer electrons from Cys57-Cys62 to the substrate thioredoxin. Cys489'-Cys490' functions similarly to Cys495-Sec496 (Sec = selenocysteine) and Cys535-XXXX-Cys540 in human and parasite Plasmodium falciparum enzymes, but a catalytic redox center formed by adjacent Cys residues, as observed in DmTrxR-1, is unprecedented. Our data show, for the first time in a high Mr TrxR, that DmTrxR-1 oscillates between the 2-electron reduced state, EH2, and the 4-electron state, EH4, in catalysis, after the initial priming reduction of the oxidized enzyme (Eox) to EH2. The reductive half-reaction consumes 2 eq of NADPH in two observable steps to produce EH4. The first equivalent yields a FADH--NADP+ charge-transfer complex that reduces the adjacent disulfide to form a thiolate-flavin charge-transfer complex. EH4 reacts with thioredoxin rapidly to produce EH2. In contrast, Eox formation is slow and incomplete; thus, EH2 of wild-type cannot reduce thioredoxin at catalytically competent rates. Mutants lacking the C-terminal redox center, C489S, C490S, and C489S/C490S, are incapable of reducing thioredoxin and can only be reduced to EH2 forms. Additional data suggest that Cys57 attacks Cys490' in the interchange reaction between the N-terminal dithiol and the C-terminal disulfide.",2003,"Holger Bauer, Vincent Massey, L David Arscott, R Heiner Schirmer, David P Ballou, Charles H Williams Jr, Holger Bauer, Vincent Massey, L David Arscott, R Heiner Schirmer, David P Ballou, Charles H Williams Jr"

Molecular evolution of the insect chemoreceptor gene superfamily in Drosophila melanogaster,14608037,10.1073/pnas.2335847100,"The insect chemoreceptor superfamily in Drosophila melanogaster is predicted to consist of 62 odorant receptor (Or) and 68 gustatory receptor (Gr) proteins, encoded by families of 60 Or and 60 Gr genes through alternative splicing. We include two previously undescribed Or genes and two previously undescribed Gr genes; two previously predicted Or genes are shown to be alternative splice forms. Three polymorphic pseudogenes and one highly defective pseudogene are recognized. Phylogenetic analysis reveals deep branches connecting multiple highly divergent clades within the Gr family, and the Or family appears to be a single highly expanded lineage within the superfamily. The genes are spread throughout the Drosophila genome, with some relatively recently diverged genes still clustered in the genome. The Gr5a gene on the X chromosome, which encodes a receptor for the sugar trehalose, has transposed from one such tandem cluster of six genes at cytological location 64, as has Gr61a, and all eight of these receptors might bind sugars. Analysis of intron evolution suggests that the common ancestor consisted of a long N-terminal exon encoding transmembrane domains 1-5 followed by three exons encoding transmembrane domains 6-7. As many as 57 additional introns have been acquired idiosyncratically during the evolution of the superfamily, whereas the ancestral introns and some of the older idiosyncratic introns have been lost at least 48 times independently. Altogether, these patterns of molecular evolution suggest that this is an ancient superfamily of chemoreceptors, probably dating back at least to the origin of the arthropods.",2003,"Hugh M Robertson, Coral G Warr, John R Carlson, Hugh M Robertson, Coral G Warr, John R Carlson"
Identification and function of thermosensory neurons in Drosophila larvae,12563263,10.1038/nn1009,"Although the ability to sense temperature is critical for many organisms, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Using the calcium reporter yellow cameleon 2.1 and electrophysiological recordings, we identified thermosensitive neurons and examined their physiologic response in Drosophila melanogaster larvae. In the head, terminal sensory organ neurons showed increased activity in response to cooling by < or =1 degrees C, heating reduced their basal activity, and different units showed distinct response patterns. Neither cooling nor heating affected dorsal organ neurons. Body wall neurons showed a variety of distinct response patterns to both heating and cooling; the diverse thermal responses were strikingly similar to those described in mammals.

An early role for the Drosophila melanogaster male seminal protein Acp36DE in female sperm storage,12939382,10.1242/jeb.00585,"Female sperm storage is an essential component of reproduction in many animals. In insects, female sperm storage affects fecundity, sperm competition/preference and receptivity to re-mating. Female sperm storage consists of several stages, including sperm entry into the sperm storage organs (SSOs), maintenance within the SSOs and exit from the SSOs. The Drosophila melanogaster male seminal protein Acp36DE is essential for female sperm storage. Acp36DE associates with sperm and localizes to specific regions of the female reproductive tract, including the SSOs. We determined the stage of sperm storage at which Acp36DE acts by comparing the timing of initial sperm entry into storage as well as the rates of sperm accumulation and release from the SSOs in the presence or absence of Acp36DE. Acp36DE accelerates sperm accumulation into storage but does not mediate the entry of the first sperm into storage. This finding also demonstrates that the initial stage of sperm storage consists of multiple steps. Acp36DE enters the SSOs before sperm, and its residence within the SSOs does not require sperm. We propose that once sperm storage has initiated, Acp36DE acts as a guidance factor helping subsequent sperm move into storage, a corral concentrating sperm around the SSO entrances and/or a trigger for responses within the female that accelerate storage of sperm.",2003,"Margaret C Bloch Qazi, Mariana F Wolfner, Margaret C Bloch Qazi, Mariana F Wolfner"
Identification of Drosophila neuropeptide receptors by G protein-coupled receptors-beta-arrestin2 interactions,14555656,10.1074/jbc.M306756200,"Activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) leads to the recruitment of beta-arrestins. By tagging the beta-arrestin molecule with a green fluorescent protein, we can visualize the activation of GPCRs in living cells. We have used this approach to de-orphan and study 11 GPCRs for neuropeptide receptors in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we verify the identities of ligands for several recently de-orphaned receptors, including the receptors for the Drosophila neuropeptides proctolin (CG6986), neuropeptide F (CG1147), corazonin (CG10698), dFMRF-amide (CG2114), and allatostatin C (CG7285 and CG13702). We also de-orphan CG6515 and CG7887 by showing these two suspected tachykinin receptor family members respond specifically to a Drosophila tachykinin neuropeptide. Additionally, the translocation assay was used to de-orphan three Drosophila receptors. We show that CG14484, encoding a receptor related to vertebrate bombesin receptors, responds specifically to allatostatin B. Furthermore, the pair of paralogous receptors CG8985 and CG13803 responds specifically to the FMRF-amide-related peptide dromyosuppressin. To corroborate the findings on orphan receptors obtained by the translocation assay, we show that dromyosuppressin also stimulated GTPgammaS binding and inhibited cAMP by CG8985 and CG13803.

Interspecies comparison of a gene pair with partially redundant function: the rst and kirre genes in D. virilis and D. melanogaster,12574866,10.1007/s00239-002-2393-2,"The D. melanogaster rst and kirre genes encode two highly related immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecules that function redundantly during embryonic muscle development. The two genes appear to be derived from a common ancestor by gene duplication. Gene duplications have been proposed to be of major evolutionary significance since duplicated redundant sequences can accumulate mutations without detrimental effects for the organism and leave the duplicated genes free to assume novel functions. To address the issue of conservation of the duplicated sequences and their putative redundancy, as well as to identify putative functional divergence of the paralogs during drosophilid evolution, we performed an interspecies comparison of the rst and kirre genes from D. virilis and D. melanogaster. The D. virilis genome contains orthologues of both rst and kirre and hence the duplication took place before the split of the two lineages and has subsequently been conserved. However, whilst the Rst orthologues show a high degree of sequence similarity, this similarity is lower in Kirre orthologues. Especially the intracellular domains of D. virilis and D. melanogaster Kirre sequences are highly divergent: the D. virilis kirre gene lacks the 3'-most exon present in D. melanogaster, which contains motifs conserved between kirre and rst in D. melanogaster. Hence, while each of the two genes is highly conserved at the level of its exon-intron organization, the selection forces acting on the rst and kirre coding sequences are different.

A Drosophila microsomal triglyceride transfer protein homolog promotes the assembly and secretion of human apolipoprotein B. Implications for human and insect transport and metabolism,12657646,10.1074/jbc.M300271200,"The assembly and secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in vertebrates requires apolipoprotein B (apoB) and the endoplasmic reticulum-localized cofactor, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP).

A Drosophila melanogaster expressed gene sequence (CG9342), displaying 23% identity with human MTP, was recently identified. When coexpressed in COS cells, CG9342 promoted the assembly and secretion of apoB34 and apoB41 (N-terminal 34 and 41% of human apoB). The apoB34-containing particles assembled by human MTP and CG9342 displayed similar peak densities of approximately 1.169 g/ml and similar lipid compositions. However, CG9342 displayed differential sensitivities to two inhibitors of human MTP and low vesicle-based lipid transfer activity, in vitro. In addition, important predicted structural distinctions exist between the human and Drosophila proteins suggesting overlapping but not identical functional roles.

      A P-type transposable element called PdL has been engineered with a doxycycline-inducible promoter directed out through the 3' end of the element. Insertion of PdL near the 5' end of a gene often yields doxycycline-dependent overexpression of that gene and a mutant phenotype. This functional genomics strategy allows for efficient screening of large numbers of genes for overexpression phenotypes.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      PdL was mobilized to around 10,000 new locations in the Drosophila melanogaster genome and used to search for genes that would extend life span when overexpressed. Six lines were identified in which there was a 5-17% increase in life span in the presence of doxyxcycline. The mutations were molecularly characterized and in each case a gene was found to be overexpressed using northern blots. Two genes did not have previously known phenotypes and are implicated in membrane transport: VhaSFD encodes a regulatory subunit of the vacuolar ATPase proton pump (H+-ATPase), whereas Sugar baby (Sug) is related to a maltose permease from Bacillus. Three PdL mutations identified previously characterized genes: filamin encodes the homolog of an actin-polymerizing protein that interacts with presenilins. four wheel drive (fwd) encodes a phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase (PI 4-kinase) and CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase-l (Cctl) encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in phosphatidylcholine synthesis. Finally, an apparently novel gene (Red herring, Rdh) was found in the first intron of the encore gene.

We have identified and characterized the establishment promoter, v-Sxl-Pe, of the distantly related species Drosophila virilis. Like melanogaster, the virilis Sxl-Pe is organized into four sub-domains: the Sxl-Pe mRNA leader and exon E1 of Sxl protein, the core promoter, the sex-specific element and the augmentation element. The core promoter and sex-specific element of v-Sxl-Pe show considerable sequence similarity to m-Sxl-Pe and contain target sites for components of the X/A signaling system. While the augmentation element of v-Sxl-Pe also has sequence motifs that could function as target sites for the X/A signaling system, it shows little similarity to the melanogaster augmentation element. Functional studies reveal that v-Sxl-Pe drives sex-specific expression in D. melanogaster embryos and that the activity of the virilis promoter is controlled by known components of the melanogaster X/A counting system. Although v-Sxl-Pe responds appropriately to the melanogaster sex determination signal, it is less active than Sxl-Pe from melanogaster. Unexpectedly, the reduced activity is due to differences in the activity of the conserved core promoter, while the non-conserved augmentation element functions effectively. These findings suggest that low-affinity target sites for the X/A counting system are critical for the functioning of Sxl-Pe.",2003,"Timothy Morgan Jinks, Gretchen Calhoun, Paul Schedl, Timothy Morgan Jinks, Gretchen Calhoun, Paul Schedl"

Variation in adult life history and stress resistance across five species of Drosophila,15133195,10.1007/BF02715818,"Dry weight at eclosion, adult lifespan, lifetime fecundity, lipid and carbohydrate content at eclosion, and starvation and desiccation resistance at eclosion were assayed on a long-term laboratory population of Drosophila melanogaster, and one recently wild-caught population each of four other species of Drosophila, two from the melanogaster and two from the immigrans species group. The relationships among trait means across the five species did not conform to expectations based on correlations among these traits inferred from selection studies on D. melanogaster. In particular, the expected positive relationships between fecundity and size/lipid content, lipid content and starvation resistance, carbohydrate (glycogen) content and desiccation resistance, and the expected negative relationship between lifespan and fecundity were not observed. Most traits were strongly positively correlated between sexes across species, except for fractional lipid content and starvation resistance per microgram lipid. For most traits, there was evidence for significant sexual dimorphism but the degree of dimorphism did not vary across species except in the case of adult lifespan, starvation resistance per microgram lipid, and desiccation resistance per microgram carbohydrate. Overall, D. nasuta nasuta and D. sulfurigaster neonasuta (immigrans group) were heavier at eclosion than the melanogaster group species, and tended to have somewhat higher absolute lipid content and starvation resistance. Yet, these two immigrans group species were shorter-lived and had lower average daily fecundity than the melanogaster group species. The smallest species, D. malerkotliana (melanogaster group), had relatively high daily fecundity, intermediate lifespan and high fractional lipid content, especially in females. D. ananassae (melanogaster group) had the highest absolute and fractional carbohydrate content, but its desiccation resistance per microgram carbohydrate was the lowest among the five species. In terms of overall performance, the laboratory population of D. melanogaster was clearly superior, under laboratory conditions, to the other four species if adult lifespan, lifetime fecundity, average daily fecundity, and absolute starvation and desiccation resistance are considered. This finding is contrary to several recent reports of substantially higher adult lifespan and stress resistance in recently wild-caught flies, relative to flies maintained for a long time in discrete-generation laboratory cultures. Possible explanations for these apparent anomalies are discussed in the context of the differing selection pressures likely to be experienced by Drosophila populations in laboratory versus wild environments.",2003,"N Sharmila Bharathi, N G Prasad, Mallikarjun Shakarad, Amitabh Joshi, N Sharmila Bharathi, N G Prasad, Mallikarjun Shakarad, Amitabh Joshi"
Nanos plays a conserved role in axial patterning outside of the Diptera,12573218,10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00045-9,"Axial patterning is a fundamental event in early development, and molecules involved in determining the body axes provide a coordinate system for subsequent patterning. While orthologs of Drosophila bicoid and nanos play a conserved role in anteroposterior (AP) patterning within at least a subset of Diptera, conservation of this process has not yet been demonstrated outside of the flies. Indeed, it has been argued that bicoid, an instrumental ""anterior"" factor in Drosophila melanogaster, acquired this role during the evolution of more-derived dipterans. Interestingly, the interaction of Drosophila maternal nanos and maternal hunchback provides a system for patterning the AP axis that is partially redundant to the anterior system. Previous studies in grasshoppers suggest that hunchback may play a conserved role in axial patterning in this insect, but this function may be supplied solely by the zygotic component of hunchback expression. Here we provide evidence that the early pattern of zygotic grasshopper Hunchback expression is achieved through translational repression that may be mediated through the action of grasshopper nanos. This is consistent with the notion that an anterior gradient system is not necessary in all insects and that the posterior pole ""probably conveys longitudinal polarity on the ensuing germ anlage"".",2003,"Sabbi Lall, Michael Z Ludwig, Nipam H Patel, Sabbi Lall, Michael Z Ludwig, Nipam H Patel"

Active sites of thioredoxin reductases: why selenoproteins?,14569031,10.1073/pnas.2134510100,"Selenium, an essential trace element for mammals, is incorporated into a selected class of selenoproteins as selenocysteine.

Surprisingly, the catalytic competence of these orthologous enzymes is similar, whereas direct Sec-to-Cys substitution of mammalian TrxR, or other selenoenzymes, yields almost inactive enzyme. TrxRs are therefore ideal for studying the biology of selenocysteine by comparative enzymology. Here we show that the serine residues flanking the C-terminal Cys residues of Drosophila TrxRs are responsible for activating the cysteines to match the catalytic efficiency of a selenocysteine-cysteine pair as in mammalian TrxR, obviating the need for selenium. This finding suggests that the occurrence of selenoenzymes, which implies that the organism is selenium-dependent, is not necessarily associated with improved enzyme efficiency.

In the somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster, Sex-lethal (Sxl) is the master regulatory gene that specifies sexual identity. We have developed a theoretical model for the initial sex-specific regulation of Sxl expression. The model is based on the well-documented molecular details of the system and uses a stochastic formulation of transcription. Numerical simulations allow quantitative assessment of the role of different regulatory mechanisms in achieving a robust switch. We establish on a formal basis that the autoregulatory loop involved in the alternative splicing of Sxl primary transcripts generates an all-or-none bistable behavior and constitutes an efficient stabilization and memorization device. The model indicates that production of a small amount of early Sxl proteins leaves the autoregulatory loop in its off state. Numerical simulations of mutant genotypes enable us to reproduce and explain the phenotypic effects of perturbations induced in the dosage of genes whose products participate in the early Sxl promoter activation.",2003,"Matthieu Louis, Liisa Holm, Lucas SÃ¡nchez, Marcelle Kaufman, Matthieu Louis, Liisa Holm, Lucas SÃ¡nchez, Marcelle Kaufman"
A novel neuronal pathway for visually guided escape in Drosophila melanogaster,19474177,10.1152/jn.00073.2009,"Drosophila melanogaster exhibits a robust escape response to objects approaching on a collision course. Although a pair of large command interneurons called the giant fibers (GFs) have been postulated to trigger such behaviors, their role has not been directly demonstrated. Here, we show that escape from visual stimuli like those generated by approaching predators does not rely on the activation of the GFs and consists of a more complex and less stereotyped motor sequence than that evoked by the GFs. Instead, the timing of escape is tightly correlated with the activity of previously undescribed descending interneurons that signal a threshold angular size of the approaching object. The activity pattern of these interneurons shares features with those of visual escape circuits of several species, including pigeons, frogs, and locusts, and may therefore have evolved under similar constraints. These results show that visually evoked escapes in Drosophila can rely on at least two descending neuronal pathways: the GFs and the novel pathway we characterize electrophysiologically. These pathways exhibit very different patterns of sensory activity and are associated with two distinct motor programs.",2009,"Haleh Fotowat, Amir Fayyazuddin, Hugo J Bellen, Fabrizio Gabbiani, Haleh Fotowat, Amir Fayyazuddin, Hugo J Bellen, Fabrizio Gabbiani"
"Separating the spindle, checkpoint, and timer functions of BubR1",19951912,10.1083/jcb.200905026,"BubR1 performs several roles during mitosis, affecting the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), mitotic timing, and spindle function, but the interdependence of these functions is unclear. We have analyzed in Drosophila melanogaster the mitotic phenotypes of kinase-dead (KD) BubR1 and BubR1 lacking the N-terminal KEN box. bubR1-KD individuals have a robust SAC but abnormal spindles with thin kinetochore fibers, suggesting that the kinase activity modulates microtubule capture and/or dynamics but is relatively dispensable for SAC function. In contrast, bubR1-KEN flies have normal spindles but no SAC. Nevertheless, mitotic timing is normal as long as Mad2 is present. Thus, the SAC, timer, and spindle functions of BubR1 are substantially separable. Timing is shorter in bubR1-KEN mad2 double mutants, yet in these flies, lacking both critical SAC components, chromosomes still segregate accurately, reconfirming that in Drosophila, reliable mitosis does not need the SAC.",2009,"Zohra Rahmani, Mary E Gagou, Christophe Lefebvre, Doruk Emre, Roger E Karess, Zohra Rahmani, Mary E Gagou, Christophe Lefebvre, Doruk Emre, Roger E Karess"
[Molecular evolution of mobile elements of the gypsy group: a homolog of the gag gene in Drosophila],19239094,,"Retrotransposons of the gypsy group of Drosophila melanogaster that are structurally similar to retroviruses of vertebrates occupy an important place among retroelements of eukaryotes. The infectious abilities of some retrotransposons of this group (gypsy, ZAM, and Idefix) have been demonstrated experimentally, and therefore they are true retroviruses. It is supposed that retrotransposons can evolve acquiring new components, the sources of which remain to be elucidated. In this work, the CG4680 gene (Gag related protein, Grp) homologous to gag of retrotransposons of the gypsy group has been identified in the genome of D. melanogaster and characterized. The Grp gene product has a highly conserved structure in different species of the Drosophilidae family and is under of stabilizing selection, which suggests its important genomic function in Drosophila. In view of the earlier data, it can be concluded that homologous genes of all components of gypsy retrotransposons are present in the Drosophila genome. These genes can be both precursors and products of domestication of retrovirus genes.",2009,"L N Nefedova, A I Kim, L N Nefedova, A I Kim"
Multiple SET methyltransferases are required to maintain normal heterochromatin domains in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster,19189944,10.1534/genetics.108.100271,"Methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) is a key feature of silent chromatin and plays an important role in stabilizing the interaction of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) with chromatin. Genomes of metazoans such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster generally encode three types of H3K9-specific SET domain methyltransferases that contribute to chromatin homeostasis during the life cycle of the organism. SU(VAR)3-9, dG9a, and dSETDB1 all function in the generation of wild-type H3K9 methylation levels in the Drosophila genome. Two of these enzymes, dSETDB1 and SU(VAR)3-9, govern heterochromatin formation in distinct but overlapping patterns across the genome. H3K9 methylation in the small, heterochromatic fourth chromosome of D. melanogaster is governed mainly by dSETDB1, whereas dSETDB1 and SU(VAR)3-9 function in concert to methylate H3K9 in the pericentric heterochromatin of all chromosomes, with dG9a having little impact in these domains, as shown by monitoring position effect variegation. To understand how these distinct heterochromatin compartments may be differentiated, we examined the developmental timing of dSETDB1 function using a knockdown strategy. dSETDB1 acts to maintain heterochromatin during metamorphosis, at a later stage in development than the reported action of SU(VAR)3-9. Surprisingly, depletion of both of these enzymes has less deleterious effect than depletion of one. These results imply that dSETDB1 acts as a heterochromatin maintenance factor that may be required for the persistence of earlier developmental events normally governed by SU(VAR)3-9. In addition, the genetic interactions between dSETDB1 and Su(var)3-9 mutations emphasize the importance of maintaining the activities of these histone methyltransferases in balance for normal genome function.",2009,"Brent Brower-Toland, Nicole C Riddle, Hongmei Jiang, Kathryn L Huisinga, Sarah C R Elgin, Brent Brower-Toland, Nicole C Riddle, Hongmei Jiang, Kathryn L Huisinga, Sarah C R Elgin"
Comparative profiling of the transcriptional response to infection in two species of Drosophila by short-read cDNA sequencing,19500410,10.1186/1471-2164-10-259,"Background:
      
    

    
      Homology-based comparisons of the genes involved in innate immunity across many insect taxa with fully sequenced genomes has revealed a striking pattern of gene gain and loss, particularly among genes that encode proteins involved in clearing pathogens (effectors). However, limited functional annotation in non-model systems has hindered understanding of evolutionary novelties in the insect innate immune system.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We use short read sequencing technology (Illumina/Solexa) to compare the transcriptional response to infection between the well studied model system Drosophila melanogaster and the distantly related drosophilid D. virilis. We first demonstrate that Illumina/Solexa sequencing of cDNA from infected and uninfected D. melanogaster recapitulates previously published microarray studies of the transcriptional response to infection in this species, validating our approach. We then show that patterns of transcription of homologous genes differ considerably between D. melanogaster and D. virilis, and identify potential candidates for novel components of the D. virilis immune system based on transcriptional data. Finally, we use a proteomic approach to characterize the protein constituents of the D. virilis hemolymph and validate our transcriptional data.

The chimeric Gilgamesh-GFP protein in spermatocytes is cortically located. In the polar and apolar spermatocytes, it concentrates at the terminal ends of the fusome, the organelle that passes through the system of ring canals of the spermatocyte cyst. At the stage of spermatid elongation, the protein associates with the nucleus. A spot of the highest Gilgamesh-GFP concentration in the nucleus co-localizes with gamma-tubulin in the basal body. At later stages, Gilgamesh is localized to the individualization complex (IC), leaving the nuclei somewhat before the IC investment cones, as detected by actin binding. The sterile mutation due to the gilgamesh gene leads to the phenotype of scattered nuclei and altered structure of actin cones in the individualizing spermatid cyst. Ultrastructural evidence confirmed defective spermatid individualization due to the mutation. The phylogenetic origin of the protein, and the connection between vesicular trafficking and spermatid individualization, are discussed.",2009,"O O Nerusheva, N V Dorogova, N V Gubanova, O S Yudina, L V Omelyanchuk, O O Nerusheva, N V Dorogova, N V Gubanova, O S Yudina, L V Omelyanchuk"

Similar selective factors affect both between-gene and between-exon divergence in Drosophila,19150804,10.1093/molbev/msp006,"As a consequence of alternative splicing, a gene's exons will have different frequencies of inclusion into mature mRNA and different patterns of expression.

Genes undergoing alternative splicing have a broader pattern of expression associated with a lower divergence rate in comparison with genes with a single annotated protein isoform. Within genes undergoing alternative splicing, we report a significant effect of inclusion level on exon evolution, as alternatively spliced exons are less conserved than constitutively spliced exons. More generally, there are significant negative correlations between inclusion level and exon evolutionary rates that can be associated with relaxation of selection. A significant effect of expression pattern on evolution rates is also observed. Overall, we found that similar selective factors such as the expression level and the pattern of expression are affecting both gene and exon evolution.",2009,"Wilfried Haerty, Brian Golding, Wilfried Haerty, Brian Golding"

Analysis of two promoters that control the expression of the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene in Drosophila melanogaster,19387565,10.1007/s10059-009-0072-5,"GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) is a key enzyme in the de novo synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin. Previously, the Drosophila melanogaster GTPCH gene has been shown to be expressed from two different promoters (P1 and P2). In our study, the 5'-flanking DNA regions required for P1 and P2 promoter activities were characterized using transient expression assay. The DNA regions between -98 and +31, and between -73 and +35 are required for efficient P1 and P2 promoter activities, respectively. The regions between -98 and -56 and between -73 and -41 may contain critical elements required for the expression of GTPCH in Drosophila. By aligning the nucleotide sequences in the P1 and P2 promoter regions of the Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis GTPCH genes, several conserved elements including palindromic sequences in the regions critical for P1 and P2 promoter activities were identified. Western blot analysis of transgenic flies transformed using P1 or P2 promoter-lacZ fusion plasmids further revealed that P1 promoter expression is restricted to the late pupae and adult developmental stages but that the P2 promoter driven expression of GTPCH is constitutive throughout fly development. In addition, X-gal staining of the embryos and imaginal discs of transgenic flies suggests that the P2 promoter is active from stage 13 of embryo and is generally active in most regions of the imaginal discs at the larval stages.",2009,"Jaegoo Byun, Jaeseung Yoon, Kwanghee Baek, Jaegoo Byun, Jaeseung Yoon, Kwanghee Baek"
Combining laser microsurgery and finite element modeling to assess cell-level epithelial mechanics,20006944,10.1016/j.bpj.2009.09.034,"Laser microsurgery and finite element modeling are used to determine the cell-level mechanics of the amnioserosa-a morphogenetically crucial epithelium on the dorsal surface of fruit fly embryos (Drosophila melanogaster). In the experiments, a tightly focused laser ablates a subcellular hole (1 microm in diameter) that passes clean through the epithelium. The surrounding cells recoil from the wound site with a large range of initial recoil velocities. These depend on the embryo's developmental stage and the subcellular wound site. The initial recoil (up to 0.1 s) is well reproduced by a base finite element model, which assumes a uniform effective viscosity inside the cells, a constant tension along each cell-cell boundary, and a large, potentially anisotropic, far-field stress--one that far exceeds the stress equivalent of the cell-edge tensions. After 0.1 s, the experimental recoils slow dramatically. This observation can be reproduced by adding viscoelastic rods along cell edges or as a fine prestressed mesh parallel to the apical and basal membranes of the cell. The mesh also reproduces a number of double-wounding experiments in which successive holes are drilled in a single cell.",2009,"M Shane Hutson, J Veldhuis, Xiaoyan Ma, Holley E Lynch, P Graham Cranston, G Wayne Brodland, M Shane Hutson, J Veldhuis, Xiaoyan Ma, Holley E Lynch, P Graham Cranston, G Wayne Brodland"
Variation in antiviral protection mediated by different Wolbachia strains in Drosophila simulans,19911047,10.1371/journal.ppat.1000656,"Drosophila C virus (DCV) is a natural pathogen of Drosophila and a useful model for studying antiviral defences. The Drosophila host is also commonly infected with the widespread endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia pipientis. When DCV coinfects Wolbachia-infected D. melanogaster, virus particles accumulate more slowly and virus induced mortality is substantially delayed. Considering that Wolbachia is estimated to infect up to two-thirds of all insect species, the observed protective effects of Wolbachia may extend to a range of both beneficial and pest insects, including insects that vector important viral diseases of humans, animals and plants. Currently, Wolbachia-mediated antiviral protection has only been described from a limited number of very closely related strains that infect D. melanogaster. We used D. simulans and its naturally occurring Wolbachia infections to test the generality of the Wolbachia-mediated antiviral protection. We generated paired D. simulans lines either uninfected or infected with five different Wolbachia strains. Each paired fly line was challenged with DCV and Flock House virus. Significant antiviral protection was seen for some but not all of the Wolbachia strain-fly line combinations tested. In some cases, protection from virus-induced mortality was associated with a delay in virus accumulation, but some Wolbachia-infected flies were tolerant to high titres of DCV. The Wolbachia strains that did protect occurred at comparatively high density within the flies and were most closely related to the D. melanogaster Wolbachia strain wMel. These results indicate that Wolbachia-mediated antiviral protection is not ubiquitous, a finding that is important for understanding the distribution of Wolbachia and virus in natural insect populations.",2009,"Sheree E Osborne, Yi San Leong, Scott L O'Neill, Karyn N Johnson, Sheree E Osborne, Yi San Leong, Scott L O'Neill, Karyn N Johnson"

Yet, few studies have investigated the patterns of allocation, depletion, and replenishment of SFPs in male animals, despite the importance of these proteins to male and female reproductive success. To investigate such SFP dynamics, it is necessary to have a sensitive method for quantifying SFP levels in males and mated females. We developed such a method by adapting the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using anti-SFP antibodies. Here, we first use two Drosophila melanogaster SFPs (ovulin and sex peptide) to demonstrate that ELISAs provide accurate measures of SFP levels. We find that, consistent with previous data from Western blotting or immunofluorescence studies, levels of both ovulin and sex peptide decline in the mated female with time since mating, but they do so at different rates. We then use ELISAs to show that males become depleted of SFPs with repeated matings, but that previously mated males are able to transfer ""virgin"" levels of SFPs after 3 days of sexual inactivity. Finally, we demonstrate that ELISAs can detect SFPs from wild-caught D. melanogaster males and, thus, potentially can be used to track mating patterns in the wild. This method of measuring SFP dynamics can be used in a wide range of species to address questions related to male reproductive investment, female mating history, and variation in female post-mating behavioral changes.",2009,"Laura K Sirot, Norene A Buehner, Anthony C Fiumera, Mariana F Wolfner, Laura K Sirot, Norene A Buehner, Anthony C Fiumera, Mariana F Wolfner"
[Regularory elements of the copia retrotransposon determine different levels of expression in different organs of males and females of Drosophila melanogaster],19334610,,"Using a model system in which the expression of the reporter gene lacZ is under the control of five deleted variants of the copia retrotransposon regulatory region, which includes the 5'-long terminal repeat (LTR) and the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR), their contribution to the control of retrotransposon activity in different organs of males and females of Drosophila melanogaster was analyzed. The whole regulatory region provides expression of the reporter gene at the embryonic stage, and in larvae and adult flies only in generative organs. The 5'-end of LTR harbors a positive regulator that determines expression of the retrotransposon in organs of all types. The 3'-end of LTR harbors a negative regulator, which is sex- and time-specific: it represses copia expression in generative organs of males at all stages of development, and only at the imaginal stage in somatic tissues, without any effect on the expression of the retrotransposon in females. 5'-UTR contains a negative regulator of copia expression: it decreases the expression in embryos and generative organs and blocks it in somatic tissues. It may be suggested that a complex set of regulatory elements was formed in the course of the evolution of the retrotransposon, which made it possible to maintain a certain level of its expression in different types of cells and tissues and at different stages of development and, thus, to limit the harm caused to the host and provide the possibility for the retrotransposon to exist in the host genome over many generations.",2009,"T V Morozova, E A Tsybul'ko, E G Pasiukova, T V Morozova, E A Tsybul'ko, E G Pasiukova"
TOR-mediated autophagy regulates cell death in Drosophila neurodegenerative disease,19720874,10.1083/jcb.200904090,"Target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling is a regulator of cell growth. TOR activity can also enhance cell death, and the TOR inhibitor rapamycin protects cells against proapoptotic stimuli. Autophagy, which can protect against cell death, is negatively regulated by TOR, and disruption of autophagy by mutation of Atg5 or Atg7 can lead to neurodegeneration. However, the implied functional connection between TOR signaling, autophagy, and cell death or degeneration has not been rigorously tested. Using the Drosophila melanogaster visual system, we show in this study that hyperactivation of TOR leads to photoreceptor cell death in an age- and light-dependent manner and that this is because of TOR's ability to suppress autophagy. We also find that genetically inhibiting TOR or inducing autophagy suppresses cell death in Drosophila models of Huntington's disease and phospholipase C (norpA)-mediated retinal degeneration. Thus, our data indicate that TOR induces cell death by suppressing autophagy and provide direct genetic evidence that autophagy alleviates cell death in several common types of neurodegenerative disease.",2009,"Tao Wang, Uyen Lao, Bruce A Edgar, Tao Wang, Uyen Lao, Bruce A Edgar"
Mutations in many genes affect aggressive behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,19519879,10.1186/1741-7007-7-29,"Background:
      
    

    
      Aggressive behavior in animals is important for survival and reproduction. Identifying the underlying genes and environmental contexts that affect aggressive behavior is important for understanding the evolutionary forces that maintain variation for aggressive behavior in natural populations, and to develop therapeutic interventions to modulate extreme levels of aggressive behavior in humans. While the role of neurotransmitters and a few other molecules in mediating and modulating levels of aggression is well established, it is likely that many additional genetic pathways remain undiscovered. Drosophila melanogaster has recently been established as an excellent model organism for studying the genetic basis of aggressive behavior. Here, we present the results of a screen of 170 Drosophila P-element insertional mutations for quantitative differences in aggressive behavior from their co-isogenic control line.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We identified 59 mutations in 57 genes that affect aggressive behavior, none of which had been previously implicated to affect aggression. Thirty-two of these mutants exhibited increased aggression, while 27 lines were less aggressive than the control. Many of the genes affect the development and function of the nervous system, and are thus plausibly relevant to the execution of complex behaviors. Others affect basic cellular and metabolic processes, or are mutations in computationally predicted genes for which aggressive behavior is the first biological annotation. Most of the mutations had pleiotropic effects on other complex traits. We characterized nine of these mutations in greater detail by assessing transcript levels throughout development, morphological changes in the mushroom bodies, and restoration of control levels of aggression in revertant alleles. All of the P-element insertions affected the tagged genes, and had pleiotropic effects on brain morphology.

Five genes, HP6, pigeon, lace, X box binding protein 1 and guftagu were found to carry replication-related element (DRE) sequences in their 5'-flanking regions. Of these, the HP6 gene carries two sequences that match seven out of eight nucleotides of DRE and two additional sequences that match six out of eight nucleotides of DRE in the 5'-flanking region. Band mobility shift assays using Drosophila Kc cell nuclear extracts demonstrated DREF binding to two of these sites and chromatin immunoprecipitation using anti-DREF antibodies confirmed that this occurs in vivo. Knockdown of DREF in Drosophila S2 cells decreased the HP6 mRNA level. The results, taken together, indicate that DREF directly regulates expression of the HP6 gene.

SMG6 promotes endonucleolytic cleavage of nonsense mRNA in human cells,19060897,10.1038/nsmb.1530,"From yeast to humans, mRNAs harboring premature termination codons (PTCs) are recognized and degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD).

In Drosophila melanogaster, NMD is initiated by endonucleolysis near the PTC, whereas in yeast and human cells the current view posits that NMD occurs by exonucleolysis from one or both RNA termini. Here we report that degradation of human nonsense mRNAs can be initiated by PTC-proximal endonucleolytic cleavage. We identify the metazoan-specific NMD factor SMG6 as the responsible endonuclease by demonstrating that mutation of conserved residues in its nuclease domain--the C-terminal PIN motif--abolishes endonucleolysis in vivo and in vitro.

How to scaffold the contractile ring for a safe cytokinesis - lessons from Anillin-related proteins,19339546,10.1242/jcs.034785,"The ingression of a cleavage furrow separates the two daughter cells at the end of cell division. In many organisms this furrow ingression is driven by the assembly and contraction of actomyosin filaments, forming a contractile ring. To achieve a successful cytokinesis, these actomyosin filaments need to be assembled in an organized manner. For this purpose, a network of cytoskeletal proteins is built at the cleavage site to act as a scaffold for actomyosin filaments and to connect them to the plasma membrane. The Drosophila melanogaster protein Anillin, and its related proteins in other organisms, has a pivotal role in the organization of this scaffold in many species, ranging from yeast to humans. Recent studies indicate that Anillin-related proteins interact not only with the structural components of the contractile ring, but also with the signalling factors that control their dynamics.

Species-specific heterochromatin prevents mitotic chromosome segregation to cause hybrid lethality in Drosophila,19859525,10.1371/journal.pbio.1000234,"Postzygotic reproductive barriers such as sterility and lethality of hybrids are important for establishing and maintaining reproductive isolation between species. Identifying the causal loci and discerning how they interfere with the development of hybrids is essential for understanding how hybrid incompatibilities (HIs) evolve, but little is known about the mechanisms of how HI genes cause hybrid dysfunctions. A previously discovered Drosophila melanogaster locus called Zhr causes lethality in F1 daughters from crosses between Drosophila simulans females and D. melanogaster males. Zhr maps to a heterochromatic region of the D. melanogaster X that contains 359-bp satellite repeats, suggesting either that Zhr is a rare protein-coding gene embedded within heterochromatin, or is a locus consisting of the noncoding repetitive DNA that forms heterochromatin. The latter possibility raises the question of how heterochromatic DNA can induce lethality in hybrids. Here we show that hybrid females die because of widespread mitotic defects induced by lagging chromatin at the time during early embryogenesis when heterochromatin is first established. The lagging chromatin is confined solely to the paternally inherited D. melanogaster X chromatids, and consists predominantly of DNA from the 359-bp satellite block. We further found that a rearranged X chromosome carrying a deletion of the entire 359-bp satellite block segregated normally, while a translocation of the 359-bp satellite block to the Y chromosome resulted in defective Y segregation in males, strongly suggesting that the 359-bp satellite block specifically and directly inhibits chromatid separation. In hybrids produced from wild-type parents, the 359-bp satellite block was highly stretched and abnormally enriched with Topoisomerase II throughout mitosis. The 359-bp satellite block is not present in D. simulans, suggesting that lethality is caused by the absence or divergence of factors in the D. simulans maternal cytoplasm that are required for heterochromatin formation of this species-specific satellite block. These findings demonstrate how divergence of noncoding repetitive sequences between species can directly cause reproductive isolation by altering chromosome segregation.",2009,"Patrick M Ferree, Daniel A Barbash, Patrick M Ferree, Daniel A Barbash"
Unraveling the protective effect of a Drosophila phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein upon bacterial infection by means of proteomics,19545586,10.1016/j.dci.2009.06.010,"This study addresses the biological function of CG18594, a Drosophila melanogaster phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) that we named PEBP1, by combining fly genetics, survival experiments and differential proteomics. We demonstrate that transgenic flies overexpressing PEBP1 are highly protected against bacterial infection due to the release of immunity-related proteins in their hemolymph. Apart from proteins that have been reported earlier to participate in insect immunity, we also identify proteins involved in metabolism and signaling, and, in addition, twelve (hypothetical) proteins with unknown function.

Positive selection has driven the evolution of the Drosophila insulin-like receptor (InR) at different timescales,19398492,10.1093/molbev/msp088,"The highly conserved insulin-signaling pathway influences very diverse processes including intermediary metabolism, reproduction, aging, and growth. The first pathway component is the insulin receptor that upon insulin binding triggers the signal-transduction cascade. Its variation, like that of other pathway components, might therefore affect many organismal traits. Variation at the ""Insulin-like"" receptor (InR) gene was surveyed both within Drosophila melanogaster and between species across the Drosophila phylogeny. In D. melanogaster, the level and pattern of variation at the approximately 8-kb region surveyed did not provide any indication of a recent selective event in this region. Maximum likelihood (ML) analyses revealed the past action of purifying selection acting differentially both across the phylogeny and along the studied gene. Moreover, the ML analyses and the McDonald and Kreitman test revealed the footprint of positive selection driving amino acid changes to fixation in the branch separating the Sophophora and the Drosophila subgenera, and in the D. melanogaster lineage, respectively. The oldest selective events could have affected either the insulin binding or the signal-transduction capacities of the receptor, whereas mutations affecting signal transduction would seem to underlie the more recent events.",2009,"Sara Guirao-Rico, Montserrat AguadÃ©, Sara Guirao-Rico, Montserrat AguadÃ©"
Ecdysone signaling regulates the formation of long-term courtship memory in adult Drosophila melanogaster,19342482,10.1073/pnas.0810213106,"Improved survival is likely linked to the ability to generate stable memories of significant experiences. Considerable evidence in humans and mammalian model animals shows that steroid hormones, which are released in response to emotionally arousing experiences, have an important role in the consolidation of memories of such events. In insects, ecdysone is the major steroid hormone, and it is well characterized with respect to its essential role in coordinating developmental transitions such as larval molting and metamorphosis. However, the functions of ecdysone in adult physiology remain largely elusive. Here, we show that 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), the active metabolite of ecdysone that is induced by environmental stimuli in adult Drosophila, has an important role in the formation of long-term memory (LTM). In male flies, the levels of 20E were found to be significantly increased after courtship conditioning, and exogenous administration of 20E either enhanced or suppressed courtship LTM, depending on the timing of its administration. We also found that mutants in which ecdysone signaling is reduced were defective in LTM, and that an elevation of 20E levels was associated with activation of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), an essential regulator of LTM formation. Our results demonstrate that the molting steroid hormone ecdysone in adult Drosophila is critical to the evolutionarily conserved strategy that is used for the formation of stable memories. We propose that ecdysone is able to consolidate memories possibly by recapturing molecular and cellular processes that are used for normal neural development.",2009,"Hiroshi Ishimoto, Takaomi Sakai, Toshihiro Kitamoto, Hiroshi Ishimoto, Takaomi Sakai, Toshihiro Kitamoto"

The single-subunit alternative oxidase (AOX) found in many eukaryotes, but not in arthropods or vertebrates, offers a potential bypass of the OXPHOS cytochrome chain under conditions of pathological OXPHOS inhibition. We have engineered Ciona intestinalis AOX for conditional expression in Drosophila melanogaster. Ubiquitous AOX expression produced no detrimental phenotype in wild-type flies. However, mitochondrial suspensions from AOX-expressing flies exhibited a significant cyanide-resistant substrate oxidation, and the flies were partially resistant to both cyanide and antimycin. AOX expression was able to complement the semilethality of partial knockdown of both cyclope (COXVIc) and the complex IV assembly factor Surf1.

In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, DmSNAPc contains three distinct polypeptides (DmSNAP190, DmSNAP50, and DmSNAP43) that are stably associated with each other and bind to the DNA as a complex. We have used mutational analysis to identify domains within each subunit that are involved in complex formation with the other two subunits in vivo. We have also identified domains in each subunit required for sequence-specific DNA binding. With one exception, domains required for subunit-subunit interactions lie in the most evolutionarily conserved regions of the proteins. However, DNA binding by DmSNAPc is dependent not only upon the conserved regions but is also highly dependent upon domains outside the conserved regions.

In this review we will summarize what is known about phospholipase D in several model organisms, including C. elegans, D. discoideum, D. rerio and D. melanogaster. In the cases where knockouts are available (C. elegans, Dictyostelium and Drosophila) the PLD gene(s) appear not to be essential for viability, but several studies are beginning to identify pathways where this activity has a role. Given that the proteins in model organisms are very similar to their mammalian counterparts, we expect that future studies in model organisms will complement and extend ongoing work in mammalian settings.

"Alternative requirements for Vestigial, Scalloped, and Dmef2 during muscle differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster",18987343,10.1091/mbc.e08-03-0288,"Vertebrate development requires the activity of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (mef2) gene family for muscle cell specification and subsequent differentiation. Additionally, several muscle-specific functions of MEF2 family proteins require binding additional cofactors including members of the Transcription Enhancing Factor-1 (TEF-1) and Vestigial-like protein families. In Drosophila there is a single mef2 (Dmef2) gene as well single homologues of TEF-1 and vestigial-like, scalloped (sd), and vestigial (vg), respectively. To clarify the role(s) of these factors, we examined the requirements for Vg and Sd during Drosophila muscle specification. We found that both are required for muscle differentiation as loss of sd or vg leads to a reproducible loss of a subset of either cardiac or somatic muscle cells in developing embryos. This muscle requirement for Sd or Vg is cell specific, as ubiquitous overexpression of either or both of these proteins in muscle cells has a deleterious effect on muscle differentiation. Finally, using both in vitro and in vivo binding assays, we determined that Sd, Vg, and Dmef2 can interact directly. Thus, the muscle-specific phenotypes we have associated with Vg or Sd may be a consequence of alternative binding of Vg and/or Sd to Dmef2 forming alternative protein complexes that modify Dmef2 activity.",2009,"Hua Deng, Sarah C Hughes, John B Bell, Andrew J Simmonds, Hua Deng, Sarah C Hughes, John B Bell, Andrew J Simmonds"

The compounds analysed are captan, maneb, zineb and ethylenethiourea (ETU) (a metabolic derivative of ethylenebisdithiocarbamates like maneb and zineb). We have also evaluated the ability of ETU to form genotoxic derivatives in vivo analysing this compound in combined treatments with sodium nitrite. Both standard and high bioactivation NORR strains have been used. Captan, usually considered a mutagen in vitro but a non-mutagen in vivo, gave negative results in the wing spot test with both crosses. Positive results were obtained for maneb in the standard cross and for ETU in both the standard and the high bioactivation cross. The genotoxicities of maneb and ETU were higher when treatments were made on media in which nitrosation is favoured. A low absorption of the fungicide and an inefficient availability of the compound in the target may explain negative results obtained with zineb in both crosses.

Characterization of Drosophila carboxypeptidase D,12393882,10.1074/jbc.M209652200,"Metallocarboxypeptidase D (CPD), is a 180-kDa protein that contains three carboxypeptidase-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytosolic tail and which functions in the processing of proteins that transit the secretory pathway. An initial report on the Drosophila melanogaster silver gene indicated a CPD-like protein with only two and a half carboxypeptidase-like domains with no transmembrane region (Settle, S. H., Jr., Green, M. M., and Burtis, K. C. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 9470-9474).

In addition, two alternative exons were found, which result in proteins with different carboxypeptidase-like domains, termed domains 1A and 1B.

Domains 1B and 2 were purified, and the enzymatic properties were examined. Both enzymes cleaved substrates with C-terminal Arg or Lys, but not Leu, and were inhibited by conventional metallopeptidase inhibitors and some divalent cations. Drosophila domain 1B is more active at neutral pH and greatly prefers C-terminal Arg over Lys, whereas domain 2 is more active at pH 5-6 and slightly prefers C-terminal Lys over Arg.

Stimulation also elevated levels of cyclic AMP (but not cyclic GMP) phosphodiesterase, a new mode of action for this class of hormone. The transcript was localised by in situ hybridisation, and the peptide by immunocytochemistry, to two groups of three neurones in the pars intercerebralis within the brain.

The best of all worlds or the best possible world? Developmental constraint in the evolution of beta-tubulin and the sperm tail axoneme,12168622,10.1046/j.1525-142x.2002.02015.x,"Through evolutionary history, some features of the phenotype show little variation. Stabilizing selection could produce this result, but the possibility also exists that a feature is conserved because it is developmentally constrained--only one or a few developmental mechanisms can produce that feature. We present experimental data documenting developmental constraint in the assembly of the motile sperm tail axoneme. The 9+2 microtubule architecture of the eukaryotic axoneme has been deeply conserved. We argue that the quality of motility supported by axonemes with this morphology explains their long conservation, rather than a developmental necessity for the 9+2 architecture. However, our functional tests in Drosophila spermatogenesis reveal considerable constraint in the coevolution of testis-specific beta-tubulin and the sperm tail axoneme. The evolution of testis beta-tubulins used in insect sperm tail axonemes is highly punctuated, indicating some pressure acting on their evolution. We provide a mechanistic explanation for their punctuated evolution by testing structure-function relationships between testis beta-tubulin and the motile axoneme in D. melanogaster. We discovered that a highly conserved sequence feature of beta-tubulins used in motile axonemes is needed to specify central pair formation. Second, our data suggest that cooperativity in the function of internal beta-tubulin amino acids is needed to support the long axonemes characteristic of Drosophila sperm tails. Thus, central pair formation constrains the evolution of the axoneme motif, and intramolecular cooperativity makes the evolution of the internal residues path dependent, which slows their evolution. Our results explain why a highly specialized beta-tubulin is needed to construct the Drosophila sperm tail axoneme. We conclude that these constraints have fixed testis-specific beta-tubulin identity in Drosophila.",2002,"Mark G Nielsen, Elizabeth C Raff, Mark G Nielsen, Elizabeth C Raff"
Developmental changes in Drosophila melanogaster following exposure to alternating electromagnetic fields,12210559,10.1002/bem.10042,"This study investigated the biological effects of alternating electromagnetic fields (EMFs) on developmental stages of Drosophila melanogaster eggs and the first, second and third instar larvae stages. D. melanogaster eggs and larval stages were exposed to a 11 mT 50 Hz field produced by a pair of Helmholtz coils. Each stage was exposed to aEMFs for 2, 4, 6 and 8 h. Features of adult flies such as head, thorax, abdomen and other morphological changes were studied and compared. The frequency of abnormal flies was calculated using statistical methods at P <.05. The results obtained from exposing larvae in different stages of development showed a significant increase in the number of abnormal adult flies, whereas no significant increase was observed in the group arising from eggs exposed to aEMFs. Also, it appeared that duration of exposure correlates with the increase in the number of abnormal flies. There was no significant difference in mortality rate and sex distribution of the abnormal flies between field exposed and the control groups.",2002,"Ghadire Mirabolghasemi, Mahnaz Azarnia, Ghadire Mirabolghasemi, Mahnaz Azarnia"
Myotropic peptides in Drosophila melanogaster and the genes that encode them,12420787,,"Myotropic peptides are structurally dissimilar; thus, they comprise different families. The cellular expressions of myotropins suggest they act as hormones, transmitters, and modulators of numerous biological processes. Drosophila melanogaster allatostatin (AST), FMRFamide-containing, dromyosuppressin (DMS), and drosulfakinin (DSK) peptides represent four different myotropin families. A different gene encodes each of these four myotropin families. D. melanogaster AST, FMRFamide-containing, DMS, and DSK peptides are present in neural and gut tissue, but are not all expressed in the same cells. These four families of myotropins affect spontaneous contractions of gut, heart, and/or reproductive tissue, but their effects are dissimilar in magnitude and time course. Based on their structures, genes, distributions, and activities, the synthesis and release of these D. melanogaster myotropins are likely governed by different sensory inputs and regulatory mechanisms. The differences in structures, precursors, cellular expressions, and activities are consistent with the conclusion that they do not play redundant roles in their effects on the frequency of muscle contractions. Orthologs of these D. melanogaster myotropins exist in other animal species; thus, research on the mechanisms involved in their production and processing, functions, and signaling may be widely applicable. Here, we review research on D. melanogaster AST, FMRFamide-containing, myosuppressin, and sulfakinin peptides.",2002,"Ruthann Nichols, William G Bendena, Stephen S Tobe"

These transcripts are produced by alternative promoter usage and alternative splicing and encode long and short OVOL2 protein isoforms, whose sequences differ from those previously reported. Mouse and human OVOL2 genes are expressed in overlapping tissues including testis, where Ovol2 expression is developmentally regulated and correlates with the meiotic/postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis. Mouse Ovol2 maps to chromosome 2 in a region containing blind-sterile (bs), a spontaneous mutation that causes spermatogenic defects and germ cell loss. No mutation has been detected in the coding region of Ovol2 from bs mice, but Ovol2 transcription was dramatically reduced in testes from these mice, suggesting that Ovol2 is expressed in male germ cells.",2002,"Baoan Li, Qian Dai, Ling Li, Mahalakshmi Nair, Douglas R Mackay, Xing Dai, Baoan Li, Qian Dai, Ling Li, Mahalakshmi Nair, Douglas R Mackay, Xing Dai"

Expression in developing immune, neural, and muscle tissues",11809773,10.1074/jbc.M112105200,"We have cloned and characterized the first galectin to be identified in Drosophila melanogaster. The amino acid sequence of Drosophila galectin showed striking sequence similarity to invertebrate and vertebrate galectins and contained amino acids that are crucial for binding beta-galactoside sugars. Confirming its identity as a galectin family member, the Drosophila galectin bound beta-galactoside sugars. Structurally, the Drosophila galectin was a tandem repeat galectin containing two carbohydrate recognition domains connected by a unique peptide link. This divalent structure suggests that like mammalian galectins, Drosophila galectin may mediate cell-cell communication or facilitate cross-linking of receptors to trigger signal transduction events. The Drosophila galectin was very abundant in embryonic, larval, and adult Drosophila. During embryogenesis, Drosophila galectin had a unique and specific tissue distribution. Drosophila galectin expression was concentrated in somatic and visceral musculature and in the central nervous system. Similar to other insect lectins, Drosophila galectin may function in both embryogenesis and in host defense.

Recombination rate and the distribution of transposable elements in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,11875027,10.1101/gr.210802,"We analyzed the distribution of 54 families of transposable elements (TEs; transposons, LTR retrotransposons, and non-LTR retrotransposons) in the chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster, using data from the sequenced genome. The density of LTR and non-LTR retrotransposons (RNA-based elements) was high in regions with low recombination rates, but there was no clear tendency to parallel the recombination rate. However, the density of transposons (DNA-based elements) was significantly negatively correlated with recombination rate. The accumulation of TEs in regions of reduced recombination rate is compatible with selection acting against TEs, as selection is expected to be weaker in regions with lower recombination. The differences in the relationship between recombination rate and TE density that exist between chromosome arms suggest that TE distribution depends on specific characteristics of the chromosomes (chromatin structure, distribution of other sequences), the TEs themselves (transposition mechanism), and the species (reproductive system, effective population size, etc.), that have differing influences on the effect of natural selection acting against the TE insertions.",2002,"CarÃ¨ne Rizzon, Gabriel Marais, Manolo Gouy, Christian BiÃ©mont, CarÃ¨ne Rizzon, Gabriel Marais, Manolo Gouy, Christian BiÃ©mont"
Hidden evolution: progress and limitations in detecting multifarious natural selection,12206367,10.1023/a:1016288725718,"From illustrative examples of research on the best-studied group of species to date, Drosophila melanogaster and its closest relatives, we argue that selection is multifarious, but often hidden. Selective fixation of new, highly advantageous alleles is the most parsimonious explanation for a typical pattern of molecular variation observed in genomic regions characterized by very low recombination: drastically reduced DNA sequence variation within species and typical levels of sequence divergence among species. At the same time, the identity of the gene (or genes) influenced by selection is not just difficult to discern; it may be impossible. Studies of the genetic basis of reproductive isolation demonstrate that, although the D. melanogaster complex species appear virtually identical, dozens of currently unidentified genes contribute to hybrid sterility. We argue that these findings are best explained by selectively-driven functional divergence and demonstrate the multifarious nature of selection. Although multifarious selection certainly occurs, the exact characters responsible for differences in survival and reproductive success are unknown. We do not see these inherent limits as a cause for despair or a problem for evolutionary biology. Instead, we hope to raise awareness of these complexities of evolution by highlighting both the progress and the limitations of characterizing multifarious natural selection.",2002,"Norman A Johnson, Richard M Kliman, Norman A Johnson, Richard M Kliman"

Annotated expressed sequence tags and cDNA microarrays for studies of brain and behavior in the honey bee,11932240,10.1101/gr.5302,"To accelerate the molecular analysis of behavior in the honey bee (Apis mellifera), we created expressed sequence tag (EST) and cDNA microarray resources for the bee brain. Over 20,000 cDNA clones were partially sequenced from a normalized (and subsequently subtracted) library generated from adult A. mellifera brains. These sequences were processed to identify 15,311 high-quality ESTs representing 8912 putative transcripts. Putative transcripts were functionally annotated (using the Gene Ontology classification system) based on matching gene sequences in Drosophila melanogaster. The brain ESTs represent a broad range of molecular functions and biological processes, with neurobiological classifications particularly well represented. Roughly half of Drosophila genes currently implicated in synaptic transmission and/or behavior are represented in the Apis EST set. Of Apis sequences with open reading frames of at least 450 bp, 24% are highly diverged with no matches to known protein sequences. Additionally, over 100 Apis transcript sequences conserved with other organisms appear to have been lost from the Drosophila genome. DNA microarrays were fabricated with over 7000 EST cDNA clones putatively representing different transcripts. Using probe derived from single bee brain mRNA, microarrays detected gene expression for 90% of Apis cDNAs two standard deviations greater than exogenous control cDNAs.

A simultaneous evaluation was also made of a large population derived from the same origin and maintained as a control for the same period. We also present computer simulations to explore the possible decline in viability of the control population due to mutation accumulation and the possible effect of selection within and between MA lines. For this purpose, we used two mutational models independent from the data analyzed and based on radically different assumptions. The first model implies a large number of mutations of small effect, whereas the second implies a much smaller number of mutations with much larger effects. The observed rate of decline in mean viability was very small but significant (0.077%). The rate of increase in among line variance (0.189 x 10(-3)) was similar to those obtained previously in the same lines. The simulation results indicated that a model of many mutations of small effect is incompatible with the evolution of the mean viability of the control and MA lines over generations, the distribution of line means after 210 generations of mutation accumulation, and the pattern of line extinction over generations. Basically, this model predicted a large drop in viability, both in the control and particularly the MA lines, that is not observed empirically. It also predicted a rate of line extinction too low in the early generations and too high in the later ones. In contrast, the model based on few mutations of large effect was generally consistent with all the observations.",2002,"A Caballero, E Cusi, C GarcÃ­a, A GarcÃ­a-Dorado, A Caballero, E Cusi, C GarcÃ­a, A GarcÃ­a-Dorado"
Temperature-induced shifts in associations of longevity with body size in Drosophila melanogaster,11926498,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb01340.x,"One of the hypotheses of growing interest in studies of responses to thermal environments suggests that trade-offs and other trait associations may be altered by temperature. Here, the commonly observed positive association between body size and longevity was examined at two adult test temperatures, 14 degrees C and 25 degrees C, in cold-stress-selected lines (S) and their controls (C) in 25 degrees C-reared Drosophila melanogaster. Thorax length (TL) and developmental time (DT) were also scored in 25 degrees C-reared individuals before and after one generation of truncation selection on longevity. The topography of the selection surface that relates longevity to thorax and wing size was temperature dependent and differed both between lines and between sexes. Longevity increased monotonically with body size (TL) in C and S females at 25 degrees C but, surprisingly, longevity decreased with body size in S individuals at 14 degees C. Body size did not diverge between S and C lines and showed no response to longevity selection. However, DT increased by 25 degrees C-longevity selection in C individuals and decreased by 14 degrees C-longevity selection in S individuals. These results suggest that trait associations (including the commonly observed trade-off between body size and DT) can greatly depend on temperature, as a shift in the sign of the correlation is possible at low temperature. Genotype x temperature interaction is an important source of variation in the relationship between soma size and longevity.",2002,"Fabian M Norry, Volker Loeschcke, Fabian M Norry, Volker Loeschcke"
Drosophila melanogaster importin alpha1 and alpha3 can replace importin alpha2 during spermatogenesis but not oogenesis,12019231,,"Importin alpha's mediate the nuclear transport of many classical nuclear localization signal (cNLS)-containing proteins.

We have begun to analyze the genetic interactions among conventional importin alpha genes by studying their capacity to rescue the male and female sterility of importin alpha2 null flies. The sterility of alpha2 null males was rescued to similar extents by importin alpha1, alpha2, and alpha3 transgenes, suggesting that all three conventional importin alpha's are capable of performing the important role of importin alpha2 during spermatogenesis. In contrast, sterility of alpha2 null females was rescued only by importin alpha2 transgenes, suggesting that it plays a paralog-specific role in oogenesis. Female infertility was also rescued by a mutant importin alpha2 transgene lacking a site that is normally phosphorylated in ovaries. These rescue experiments suggest that male and female gametogenesis have distinct requirements for importin alpha2.",2002,"D Adam Mason, Robert J Fleming, David S Goldfarb, D Adam Mason, Robert J Fleming, David S Goldfarb"
Drosophila Mi-2 negatively regulates dDREF by inhibiting its DNA-binding activity,12077345,10.1128/mcb.22.14.5182-5193.2002,"Drosophila melanogaster DNA replication-related element (DRE) factor (dDREF) is a transcriptional regulatory factor required for the expression of genes carrying the 5'-TATCGATA DRE. dDREF has been reported to bind to a sequence in the chromatin boundary element, and thus, dDREF may play a part in regulating insulator activity. To generate further insights into dDREF function, we carried out a Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid screening with DREF polypeptide as bait and identified Mi-2 as a DREF-interacting protein. Biochemical analyses revealed that the C-terminal region of Drosophila Mi-2 (dMi-2) specifically binds to the DNA-binding domain of dDREF. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that dMi-2 thereby inhibits the DNA-binding activity of dDREF. Ectopic expression of dDREF and dMi-2 in eye imaginal discs resulted in severe and mild rough-eye phenotypes, respectively, whereas flies simultaneously expressing both proteins exhibited almost-normal eye phenotypes. Half-dose reduction of the dMi-2 gene enhanced the DREF-induced rough-eye phenotype. Immunostaining of polytene chromosomes of salivary glands showed that dDREF and dMi-2 bind in mutually exclusive ways. These lines of evidence define a novel function of dMi-2 in the negative regulation of dDREF by its DNA-binding activity. Finally, we postulated that dDREF and dMi-2 may demonstrate reciprocal regulation of their functions.",2002,"Fumiko Hirose, Nobuko Ohshima, Eun-Jeong Kwon, Hideki Yoshida, Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Fumiko Hirose, Nobuko Ohshima, Eun-Jeong Kwon, Hideki Yoshida, Masamitsu Yamaguchi"

The Drosophila retained/dead ringer gene and ARID gene family function during development,12141428,,"The recently discovered ARID family of proteins interact with DNA through a phylogenetically conserved sequence termed the A/T Interaction Domain (ARID). The retained/dead ringer (retn/dri) gene of Drosophila melanogaster is a founding member of the ARID gene family, and of the eARID subfamily. This subfamily exhibits an extended region of sequence similarity beyond the core ARID motif and a separate conserved domain termed the REKLES domain. retn/dri is involved in a range of developmental processes, including axis patterning and muscle development. The retn/dri ARID motif has been shown by in vitro studies to exhibit sequence-specific DNA binding activity. Here we demonstrate that the ARID domain is essential for the in vivo function of retn/dri during embryonic development by showing that a mutant form of RETN/DRI, deleted for part of the ARID domain and unable to bind DNA in vitro, cannot rescue the retn/dri mutant phenotype. In the presence of wild-type RETN/DRI this construct acts as a dominant negative, providing additional support for the proposal that RETN/DRI acts in a multiprotein complex. In contrast, we are yet to find an in vivo role for the REKLES domain, despite its clear evolutionary conservation.

Genome-wide DNA replication profile for Drosophila melanogaster: a link between transcription and replication timing,12355067,10.1038/ng1005,"Replication of the genome before mitotic cell division is a highly regulated process that ensures the fidelity of DNA duplication. DNA replication initiates at specific locations, termed origins of replication, and progresses in a defined temporal order during the S phase of the cell cycle. The relationship between replication timing and gene expression has been the subject of some speculation. A recent genome-wide analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed no association between replication timing and gene expression. In higher eukaryotes, the limited number of genomic loci analyzed has not permitted a firm conclusion regarding this association. To explore the relationship between DNA replication and gene expression in higher eukaryotes, we developed a strategy to measure the timing of DNA replication for thousands of genes in a single DNA array hybridization experiment. Using this approach, we generated a genome-wide map of replication timing for Drosophila melanogaster. Moreover, by surveying over 40% of all D. melanogaster genes, we found a strong correlation between DNA replication early in S phase and transcriptional activity.

These regions, together with the ITS-1, ITS-2 and 5.8S rDNA presented elsewhere (accession number U36206), constitute the composite sequence of the entire rDNA unit, making S. sanctipauli the second dipteran species of medical importance for which the entire rDNA has been sequenced. Despite the lack of sequence identity, the IGS of S. sanctipauli showed some structural similarities to other Diptera, i.e. the mosquito Aedes albopictus Skuse (Culicidae), the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster Meigen (Drosophilidae) and the tsetse Glossina (Glossinidae). Two blocks of tandemly repeated subunits were present in the IGS of S. sanctipauli and, unlike other species of Diptera, they contained no duplications of promoter-like sequences. However, two promoter-like sequences were identified in the unique DNA stretches of the IGS by their sequence similarity to the promoter of Aedes aegypti L. (Diptera: Culicidae). The observed sequence variation can be explained, as in the case of Drosophila spp., by the occurrence of slippage-like and point mutation processes, with unequal crossing-over homogenizing (to a certain extent) the region throughout the gene family and blackfly population. The 18S and 28S rDNA genes show more intraspecific variability within the expansion segments than in the core regions. This is also the case in the interspecific comparison of these genes from S. sanctipauli with those of Simulium vittatum, Ae. albopictus and D. melanogaster. This pattern is typical of many eukaryotes and likely to be the result of a more relaxed functional selection in the expansion segments than on the core regions.

Ectopic expression of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein, DEBCL, also fails to show any cytochrome c release from mitochondria. A significant proportion of cellular DRONC and DRICE appears to localize near mitochondria, suggesting that an apoptosome may form in the vicinity of mitochondria in the absence of cytochrome c release. In vitro, DRONC was recruited to a >700-kD complex, similar to the mammalian apoptosome in cell extracts supplemented with cytochrome c and dATP. These results suggest that caspase activation in insects follows a more primitive mechanism that may be the precursor to the caspase activation pathways in mammals.",2002,"Loretta Dorstyn, Stuart Read, Dimitrios Cakouros, Jun R Huh, Bruce A Hay, Sharad Kumar, Loretta Dorstyn, Stuart Read, Dimitrios Cakouros, Jun R Huh, Bruce A Hay, Sharad Kumar"

We show that, from the perspective of the whole long-term experiment. it is hard to decide up to which generation viability can be considered to decline linearly. Depending on this decision, and on whether or not the regression is forced through the origin, very different estimates are obtained. Furthermore, the particular behaviour of the lines used as control suggests that they could have been different from the remaining lines at the beginning of the experiment, and casts doubts on the adequacy of a forced regression. Estimates from the linear unforced regression (delta MII = 0.011) or from the linear term in a quadratic unforced regression (delta MII = 0.001) are very different.

      Using automated behavioural monitoring, a capillary feeding assay and pharmacological treatments, we examined the effect of dietary yeast and sucrose upon Drosophila sleep-wake behaviour for three consecutive days. We found that dietary yeast deconsolidated the sleep-wake behaviour of flies by promoting arousal from sleep in males and shortening periods of locomotor activity in females. We also demonstrate that arousal from nocturnal sleep exhibits a significant ultradian rhythmicity with a periodicity of 85 minutes. Increasing the dietary sucrose concentration from 5% to 35% had no effect on total sucrose ingestion per day nor any affect on arousal, however it did lengthen the time that males and females remained active. Higher dietary sucrose led to reduced total sleep by male but not female flies. Locomotor activity was reduced by feeding flies Metformin, a drug that inhibits oxidative phosphorylation, however Metformin did not affect any aspects of sleep.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We conclude that arousal from sleep is under ultradian control and regulated in a sex-dependent manner by dietary yeast and that dietary sucrose regulates the length of time that flies sustain periods of wakefulness. These findings highlight Drosophila as an important model with which to understand how diet impacts upon sleep and wakefulness in mammals and humans.",2010,"James H Catterson, Seymour Knowles-Barley, Katherine James, Margarete M S Heck, Anthony J Harmar, Paul S Hartley, James H Catterson, Seymour Knowles-Barley, Katherine James, Margarete M S Heck, Anthony J Harmar, Paul S Hartley"
Homology modelling of Drosophila cytochrome P450 enzymes associated with insecticide resistance,20583201,10.1002/ps.1986,"Background:
      
    

    
      Overexpression of the cytochrome P450 gene Cyp6g1 confers resistance against DDT and a broad range of other insecticides in Drosophila melanogaster Meig. In the absence of crystal structures of CYP6G1 or complexes with its substrates, structural studies rely on homology modelling and ligand docking to understand P450-substrate interactions.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Homology models are presented for CYP6G1, a P450 associated with resistance to DDT and neonicotinoids, and two other enzymes associated with insecticide resistance in D. melanogaster, CYP12D1 and CYP6A2. The models are based on a template of the X-ray structure of the phylogenetically related human CYP3A4, which is known for its broad substrate specificity. The model of CYP6G1 has a much smaller active site cavity than the template. The cavity is also 'V'-shaped and is lined with hydrophobic residues, showing high shape and chemical complementarity with the molecular characteristics of DDT. Comparison of the DDT-CYP6G1 complex and a non-resistant CYP6A2 homology model implies that tight-fit recognition of this insecticide is important in CYP6G1. The active site can accommodate differently shaped substrates ranging from imidacloprid to malathion but not the pyrethroids permethrin and cyfluthrin.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:

Drosophila cuticular hydrocarbons revisited: mating status alters cuticular profiles,20231905,10.1371/journal.pone.0009607,"Most living organisms use pheromones for inter-individual communication. In Drosophila melanogaster flies, several pheromones perceived either by contact/at a short distance (cuticular hydrocarbons, CHs), or at a longer distance (cis-vaccenyl acetate, cVA), affect courtship and mating behaviours. However, it has not previously been possible to precisely identify all potential pheromonal compounds and simultaneously monitor their variation on a time scale. To overcome this limitation, we combined Solid Phase Micro-Extraction with gas-chromatography coupled with mass-spectrometry. This allowed us (i) to identify 59 cuticular compounds, including 17 new CHs; (ii) to precisely quantify the amount of each compound that could be detected by another fly, and (iii) to measure the variation of these substances as a function of aging and mating. Sex-specific variation appeared with age, while mating affected cuticular compounds in both sexes with three possible patterns: variation was (i) reciprocal in the two sexes, suggesting a passive mechanical transfer during mating, (ii) parallel in both sexes, such as for cVA which strikingly appeared during mating, or (iii) unilateral, presumably as a result of sexual interaction. We provide a complete reassessment of all Drosophila CHs and suggest that the chemical conversation between male and female flies is far more complex than is generally accepted. We conclude that focusing on individual compounds will not provide a satisfactory understanding of the evolution and function of chemical communication in Drosophila.",2010,"Claude Everaerts, Jean-Pierre Farine, Matthew Cobb, Jean-FranÃ§ois Ferveur, Claude Everaerts, Jean-Pierre Farine, Matthew Cobb, Jean-FranÃ§ois Ferveur"
Identification and mapping of induced chromosomal deletions using sequence polymorphisms,20078428,10.2144/000113348,"One of the many advantages of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism is the relative ease with which gene deletions can be generated by imprecise excision of transposon insertions. Here, we describe a simple, fast, and efficient method of screening for single-gene excision events that is not biased by prior assumptions of the mutant phenotype. DNA sequence polymorphisms were used as co-dominant electrophoretic markers to identify candidate deletions in a single generation, and to delimit the breakpoints to within 0.5-1 kb, thereby rapidly identifying deficiencies that affect only the gene of interest. In addition, we used polymorphism profiling to map existing deficiencies. The method can also be applied to map the extent of deletions generated by x-rays and to identify targeted mutations generated by engineered zinc-finger nucleases in Drosophila and other polymorphic model organisms (e.g., zebrafish, mouse, Caenorhabditis elegans).",2010,"Emmanuel Vanrobays, Barbara H Jennings, David Ish-Horowicz, Emmanuel Vanrobays, Barbara H Jennings, David Ish-Horowicz"
Odorant receptor polymorphisms and natural variation in olfactory behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,20628035,10.1534/genetics.110.119446,"Animals perceive and discriminate among a vast array of sensory cues in their environment. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to individual variation in behavioral responses to these cues. Here, we asked to what extent sequence variants in six Drosophila melanogaster odorant receptor (Or) genes are associated with variation in behavioral responses to benzaldehyde by sequencing alleles from a natural population. Sequence analyses showed signatures of deviations from neutrality for Or42b and Or85f, and linkage disequilibrium analyses showed a history of extensive recombination between polymorphic markers for all six Or genes. We identified polymorphisms in Or10a, Or43a, and Or67b that were significantly associated with variation in response to benzaldehyde. To verify these associations, we repeated the analyses with an independent set of behavioral measurements of responses to a structurally similar odorant, acetophenone. Association profiles for both odorants were similar with many polymorphisms and haplotypes associated with variation in responsiveness to both odorants. Some polymorphisms, however, were associated with one, but not the other odorant. We also observed a correspondence between behavioral response to benzaldehyde and differences in Or10a and Or43a expression. These results illustrate that sequence variants that arise during the evolution of odorant receptor genes can contribute to individual variation in olfactory behavior and give rise to subtle shifts in olfactory perception.",2010,"Stephanie M Rollmann, Ping Wang, Priya Date, Steven A West, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt, Stephanie M Rollmann, Ping Wang, Priya Date, Steven A West, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt"

The timing of mating influences reproductive success in Drosophila melanogaster: implications for sexual conflict,20345814,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.01973.x,"Despite its potential importance, the role of the timing of mating(s) as a source of variation in female lifetime reproductive success has been largely overlooked. Here, using a laboratory-adapted population of the model species Drosophila melanogaster, we explore how temporal variation in the patterns of single and multiple matings influences female fecundity. We find that the boost to fecundity known to occur after a virgin female's initial mating also extends to subsequent matings as nonvirgins, but only for a short duration. This fecundity boost at least partially offsets the direct costs of multiple matings to females in this population of D. melanogaster.

Attention-like deficit and hyperactivity in a Drosophila memory mutant,20089909,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4516-09.2010,"The primary function of a brain is to produce adaptive behavioral choices by selecting the right action at the right time. In humans, attention determines action selection as well as memory formation, whereas memories also guide which external stimuli should be attended to (Chun and Turk-Browne, 2007). The complex codependence of attention, memory, and action selection makes approaching the neurobiological basis of these interactions difficult in higher animals. Therefore, a successful reductionist approach is to turn to simpler systems for unraveling such complex biological problems. In a constantly changing environment, even simple animals have evolved attention-like processes to effectively filter incoming sensory stimuli. These processes can be studied in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, by a variety of behavioral and electrophysiological techniques. Recent work has shown that mutations affecting olfactory memory formation in Drosophila also produce distinct defects in visual attention-like behavior (van Swinderen, 2007; van Swinderen et al., 2009). In this study, we extend those results to describe visual attention-like defects in the Drosophila memory consolidation mutant radish(1). In both behavioral and brain-recording assays, radish mutant flies consistently displayed responses characteristic of a reduced attention span, with more frequent perceptual alternations and more random behavior compared with wild-type flies. Some attention-like defects were successfully rescued by administering a drug commonly used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in humans, methylphenidate. Our results suggest that a balance between persistence and flexibility is crucial for adaptive action selection in flies and that this balance requires radish gene function.",2010,"Bruno van Swinderen, BjÃ¶rn Brembs, Bruno van Swinderen, BjÃ¶rn Brembs"

Blocking O-linked GlcNAc cycling in Drosophila insulin-producing cells perturbs glucose-insulin homeostasis,20926386,10.1074/jbc.M110.155192,"A dynamic cycle of O-linked GlcNAc (O-GlcNAc) addition and removal is catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase and O-GlcNAcase, respectively, in a process that serves as the final step in a nutrient-driven ""hexosamine-signaling pathway."" Evidence points to a role for O-GlcNAc cycling in diabetes and insulin resistance. We have used Drosophila melanogaster to determine whether O-GlcNAc metabolism plays a role in modulating Drosophila insulin-like peptide (dilp) production and insulin signaling. We employed transgenesis to either overexpress or knock down Drosophila Ogt(sxc) and Oga in insulin-producing cells (IPCs) or fat bodies using the GAL4-UAS system. Knockdown of Ogt decreased Dilp2, Dilp3, and Dilp5 production, with reduced body size and decreased phosphorylation of Akt in vivo. In contrast, knockdown of Oga increased Dilp2, Dilp3, and Dilp5 production, increased body size, and enhanced phosphorylation of Akt in vivo. However, knockdown of either Ogt(sxc) or Oga in the IPCs increased the hemolymph carbohydrate concentration. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Akt stimulated by extraneous insulin in an ex vivo cultured fat body of third instar larvae was diminished in strains subjected to IPC knockdown of Ogt or Oga. Knockdown of O-GlcNAc cycling enzymes in the fat body dramatically reduced neutral lipid stores. These results demonstrate that altered O-GlcNAc cycling in Drosophila IPCs modulates insulin production and influences the insulin responsiveness of peripheral tissues. The observed phenotypes in O-GlcNAc cycling mimic pancreatic Î²-cell dysfunction and glucose toxicity related to sustained hyperglycemia in mammals.",2010,"Osamu Sekine, Dona C Love, David S Rubenstein, John A Hanover, Osamu Sekine, Dona C Love, David S Rubenstein, John A Hanover"
Mutations of DMYPT cause over constriction of contractile rings and ring canals during Drosophila germline cyst formation,20542024,10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.06.008,"Ring canals, also known as stable intercellular bridges, are derived from the contractile rings of incomplete cytokinesis (IC) in most organisms. Formation of ring canals is necessary to generate functional eggs and sperm in multiple organisms including insects, birds, mammals and various plants. How the constriction of a contractile ring is arrested and how an arrested contractile ring is transformed into a ring canal is unknown. We describe here the function of the Drosophila melanogaster myosin binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (DMYPT) in both processes. We have found that DMYPT is highly enriched in the cytoplasm of cells undergoing IC during oogenesis. DMYPT mutations in germ cells, but not in somatic follicle cells, resulted in over-constriction of contractile rings and ring canals. This leads to formation of small ring canals and mis-regulation of centriole migration during female germline cyst formation. Our results suggest that there may be two parallel mechanisms to prevent the contractile rings from being completely closed, physical resistance and inhibition of myosin II activity via DMYPT.",2010,"Sengkai Ong, Christopher Foote, Change Tan, Sengkai Ong, Christopher Foote, Change Tan"

Evolution of the Drosophila feminizing switch gene Sex-lethal,20837995,10.1534/genetics.110.121202,"In Drosophila melanogaster, the gene Sex-lethal (Sxl) controls all aspects of female development. Since melanogaster males lacking Sxl appear wild type, Sxl would seem to be functionally female specific. Nevertheless, in insects as diverse as honeybees and houseflies, Sxl seems not to determine sex or to be functionally female specific. Here we describe three lines of work that address the questions of how, when, and even whether the ancestor of melanogaster Sxl ever shed its non-female-specific functions. First, to test the hypothesis that the birth of Sxl's closest paralog allowed Sxl to lose essential ancestral non-female-specific functions, we determined the CG3056 null phenotype. That phenotype failed to support this hypothesis. Second, to define when Sxl might have lost ancestral non-female-specific functions, we isolated and characterized Sxl mutations in D. virilis, a species distant from melanogaster and notable for the large amount of Sxl protein expression in males. We found no change in Sxl regulation or functioning in the 40+ MY since these two species diverged. Finally, we discovered conserved non-sex-specific Sxl mRNAs containing a previously unknown, potentially translation-initiating exon, and we identified a conserved open reading frame starting in Sxl male-specific exon 3. We conclude that Drosophila Sxl may appear functionally female specific not because it lost non-female-specific functions, but because those functions are nonessential in the laboratory. The potential evolutionary relevance of these nonessential functions is discussed.",2010,"Thomas W Cline, Maia Dorsett, Sha Sun, Melissa M Harrison, Jessica Dines, Louise Sefton, Lisa Megna, Thomas W Cline, Maia Dorsett, Sha Sun, Melissa M Harrison, Jessica Dines, Louise Sefton, Lisa Megna"

Our study shows that within population variation explained a larger proportion of overall phenotypic variance (80%) than among populations (7Â·2%). We also noticed that an important fraction of variation was sex-specific. Overall females were more resistant to starvation than males; however, the magnitude of the sexual dimorphism (SD) in SR varied among lines and explained a significant fraction of phenotypic variance in all populations.

A conserved role for syndecan family members in the regulation of whole-body energy metabolism,20585652,10.1371/journal.pone.0011286,"Syndecans are a family of type-I transmembrane proteins that are involved in cell-matrix adhesion, migration, neuronal development, and inflammation. Previous quantitative genetic studies pinpointed Drosophila Syndecan (dSdc) as a positional candidate gene affecting variation in fat storage between two Drosophila melanogaster strains. Here, we first used quantitative complementation tests with dSdc mutants to confirm that natural variation in this gene affects variability in Drosophila fat storage. Next, we examined the effects of a viable dSdc mutant on Drosophila whole-body energy metabolism and associated traits. We observed that young flies homozygous for the dSdc mutation had reduced fat storage and slept longer than homozygous wild-type flies. They also displayed significantly reduced metabolic rate, lower expression of spargel (the Drosophila homologue of PGC-1), and reduced mitochondrial respiration. Compared to control flies, dSdc mutants had lower expression of brain insulin-like peptides, were less fecund, more sensitive to starvation, and had reduced life span. Finally, we tested for association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human SDC4 gene and variation in body composition, metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and sleep traits in a cohort of healthy early pubertal children. We found that SNP rs4599 was significantly associated with resting energy expenditure (P = 0.001 after Bonferroni correction) and nominally associated with fasting glucose levels (P = 0.01) and sleep duration (P = 0.044). On average, children homozygous for the minor allele had lower levels of glucose, higher resting energy expenditure, and slept shorter than children homozygous for the common allele.

In addition, structural studies have shown that although both these domains have much in common at the inhibitor binding site, there are significant differences and these are greater at the peptide binding sites than regions distal to the active site. As a model system, we have used an ACE homologue from Drosophila melanogaster (AnCE, a single domain protein with ACE activity) to study ACE inhibitor binding.

The EVOOs tested are shown to be non-genotoxic; they exhibited antigenotoxic activity against the effects of hydrogen peroxide. Triolein, tyrosol and squalene did not show genotoxic effects in the proliferative imaginal cells of D. melanogaster.

Hormonal regulation of Drosophila microRNA let-7 and miR-125 that target innate immunity,20798594,10.4161/fly.4.4.13008,"The steroid 20-hydroxy-ecdysone (20-HE) and the sesquiterpenoid Juvenile Hormone (JH) coordinate insect life stage transitions. 20-HE exerts these effects by the sequential induction of response genes. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans hormones also play a role in such transitions, but notably, microRNA such as let-7 and lin-4 have likewise been found to help order developmental steps. Little is known about the corresponding function of homologous microRNA in Drosophila melanogaster, and the way microRNA might be regulated by 20-HE in the fly is ambiguous. Here we used Drosophila S2 cells to analyze the effects of 20-HE on D. melanogaster microRNA let-7 and miR-125, the homolog of lin-4. The induction by 20-HE of let-7 and miR-125 in S2 cells is inhibited by RNAi knockdown of the ecdysone receptor and, as previously shown, by knockdown of its cofactor broad-complex C. To help resolve the currently ambiguous role of 20-HE in the control of microRNA, we show that nanomolar concentrations of 20-HE primes cells to subsequently express microRNA when exposed to micromolar levels of 20-HE. We then explore the role microRNA plays in the established relationship between 20-HE and the induction of innate immunity. We show that the 3'UTR of the antimicrobial peptide diptericin has a let-7 binding site and that let-7 represses translation from this site. We conclude that 20-HE facilitates the initial expression of innate immunity while it simultaneously induces negative regulation via microRNA control of antimicrobial peptide translation.",2010,"Alina Garbuzov, Marc Tatar, Alina Garbuzov, Marc Tatar"

Second, we tested the conservation of modifier gene function across species; genes identified in one invertebrate model were tested for function in the other invertebrate model. Drosophila orthologs of two genes, which were identified originally in C. elegans, modified Drosophila SMN loss of function defects. C. elegans orthologs of twelve genes, which were originally identified in a previous Drosophila screen, modified C. elegans SMN loss of function defects. Bioinformatic analysis of the conserved, cross-species, modifier genes suggests that conserved cellular pathways, specifically endocytosis and mRNA regulation, act as critical genetic modifiers of SMN loss of function defects across species.",2010,"Maria Dimitriadi, James N Sleigh, Amy Walker, Howard C Chang, Anindya Sen, Geetika Kalloo, Jevede Harris, Tom Barsby, Melissa B Walsh, John S Satterlee, Chris Li, David Van Vactor, Spyros Artavanis-Tsakonas, Anne C Hart, Maria Dimitriadi, James N Sleigh, Amy Walker, Howard C Chang, Anindya Sen, Geetika Kalloo, Jevede Harris, Tom Barsby, Melissa B Walsh, John S Satterlee, Chris Li, David Van Vactor, Spyros Artavanis-Tsakonas, Anne C Hart"
Studying patterns of recent evolution at synonymous sites and intronic sites in Drosophila melanogaster,20041239,10.1007/s00239-009-9314-6,"Most previous studies of the evolution of codon usage bias (CUB) and intronic GC content (iGC) in Drosophila melanogaster were based on between-species comparisons, reflecting long-term evolutionary events. However, a complete picture of the evolution of CUB and iGC cannot be drawn without knowledge of their more recent evolutionary history. Here, we used a polymorphism dataset collected from Zimbabwe to study patterns of the recent evolution of CUB and iGC. Analyzing coding and intronic data jointly with a model which can simultaneously estimate selection, mutational, and demographic parameters, we have found that: (1) natural selection is probably acting on synonymous codons; (2) a constant population size model seems to be sufficient to explain most of the observed synonymous polymorphism patterns; (3) GC is favored over AT in introns. In agreement with the long-term evolutionary patterns, ongoing selection acting on X-linked synonymous codons is stronger than that acting on autosomal codons. The selective differences between preferred and unpreferred codons tend to be greater than the differences between GC and AT in introns, suggesting that natural selection, not just biased gene conversion, may have influenced the evolution of CUB. Interestingly, evidence for non-equilibrium evolution comes exclusively from the intronic data. However, three different models, an equilibrium model with two classes of selected sites and two non-equilibrium models with changes in either population size or mutational parameters, fit the intronic data equally well. These results show that using inadequate selection (or demographic) models can result in incorrect estimates of demographic (or selection) parameters.",2010,"Kai Zeng, Brian Charlesworth, Kai Zeng, Brian Charlesworth"
Hrp48 attenuates Sxl expression to allow for proper notch expression and signaling in wing development,20351283,10.1073/pnas.0910570107,"Different signaling pathways are deployed in specific developmental contexts to generate sexually dimorphic traits. Recently, Sex-lethal (Sxl), the female determinant in Drosophila melanogaster, was shown to down-regulate Notch (N) signaling to accomplish sex-specific patterning. Paradoxically, however, both Sxl and N are ubiquitously expressed in all of the female cells. This raises a key question as to how, during monomorphic female development, N signaling escapes the negative impact of Sxl. Here, we uncover a regulatory loop involving Hrp48, an abundant Drosophila hnRNP, Sxl and N. Phenotypic consequences of the partial loss of hrp48 resemble that of N but are more pronounced in females than in males. Likewise, N levels are drastically diminished only in females. Interestingly, monomorphic female tissues including wing, eye and antennal discs display considerable increase in Sxl amounts. Finally, female-specific attenuation of N signaling is rescued upon simultaneous removal of Sxl. Thus, our data demonstrate that in monomorphic contexts, Hrp48 functions as a moderator of Sxl expression to achieve adequate levels of N receptor production and signaling. We propose that it is critical to modulate the activities of the master determinant underling sexual dimorphism, to ensure that it does not function inappropriately in monomorphic tissues and disrupt their development.",2010,"Yaron Suissa, Yossi Kalifa, Tama Dinur, Patricia Graham, Girish Deshpande, Paul Schedl, Offer Gerlitz, Yaron Suissa, Yossi Kalifa, Tama Dinur, Patricia Graham, Girish Deshpande, Paul Schedl, Offer Gerlitz"
Mechanisms of apoptosis in Crustacea: What conditions induce versus suppress cell death?,20043212,10.1007/s10495-009-0443-6,"Arthropoda is the largest of all animal phyla and includes about 90% of extant species. Our knowledge about regulation of apoptosis in this phylum is largely based on findings for the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Recent work with crustaceans shows that apoptotic proteins, and presumably mechanisms of cell death regulation, are more diverse in arthropods than appreciated based solely on the excellent work with fruit flies. Crustacean homologs exist for many major proteins in the apoptotic networks of mammals and D. melanogaster, but integration of these proteins into the physiology and pathophysiology of crustaceans is far from complete. Whether apoptosis in crustaceans is mainly transcriptionally regulated as in D. melanogaster (e.g., RHG 'killer' proteins), or rather is controlled by pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins as in vertebrates needs to be clarified. Some phenomena like the calcium-induced opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) are apparently lacking in crustaceans and may represent a vertebrate invention. We speculate that differences in regulation of the intrinsic pathway of crustacean apoptosis might represent a prerequisite for some species to survive harsh environmental insults. Pro-apoptotic stimuli described for crustaceans include UV radiation, environmental toxins, and a diatom-produced chemical that promotes apoptosis in offspring of a copepod. Mechanisms that serve to depress apoptosis include the inhibition of caspase activity by high potassium in energetically healthy cells, alterations in nucleotide abundance during energy-limited states like diapause and anoxia, resistance to opening of the calcium-induced MPTP, and viral accommodation during persistent viral infection. Characterization of the players, pathways, and their significance in the core machinery of crustacean apoptosis is revealing new insights for the field of cell death.",2010,"Michael A Menze, Grady Fortner, Suman Nag, Steven C Hand, Michael A Menze, Grady Fortner, Suman Nag, Steven C Hand"
"Object preference by walking fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, is mediated by vision and graviperception",20581279,10.1242/jeb.041749,"Walking fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, use visual information to orient towards salient objects in their environment, presumably as a search strategy for finding food, shelter or other resources. Less is known, however, about the role of vision or other sensory modalities such as mechanoreception in the evaluation of objects once they have been reached. To study the role of vision and mechanoreception in exploration behavior, we developed a large arena in which we could track individual fruit flies as they walked through either simple or more topologically complex landscapes. When exploring a simple, flat environment lacking three-dimensional objects, flies used visual cues from the distant background to stabilize their walking trajectories. When exploring an arena containing an array of cones, differing in geometry, flies actively oriented towards, climbed onto, and explored the objects, spending most of their time on the tallest, steepest object. A fly's behavioral response to the geometry of an object depended upon the intrinsic properties of each object and not a relative assessment to other nearby objects. Furthermore, the preference was not due to a greater attraction towards tall, steep objects, but rather a change in locomotor behavior once a fly reached and explored the surface. Specifically, flies are much more likely to stop walking for long periods when they are perched on tall, steep objects. Both the vision system and the antennal chordotonal organs (Johnston's organs) provide sufficient information about the geometry of an object to elicit the observed change in locomotor behavior. Only when both these sensory systems were impaired did flies not show the behavioral preference for the tall, steep objects.",2010,"Alice A Robie, Andrew D Straw, Michael H Dickinson, Alice A Robie, Andrew D Straw, Michael H Dickinson"

Using the antibody for the C-terminal part of the Dm NXF1 protein we have shown the cytoplasmic localization of the Dm NXF1 protein at early stages of the spermatogenesis. This protein is localized in the nuclear envelope at the stage of rounded spermatid. During the period of elongation, the Dm NXF1 protein has a polar localization, and is located only along one side of the extended spermatid nucleus.

Cutting the nonsense: the degradation of PTC-containing mRNAs,21118136,10.1042/BST0381615,"In eukaryotes, mRNAs harbouring PTCs (premature translation-termination codons) are recognized and eliminated by NMD (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay). In addition to its quality-control function, NMD constitutes a translation-dependent post-transcriptional pathway to regulate the expression levels of physiological mRNAs. In contrast with PTC recognition, little is known about the mechanisms that trigger the rapid degradation of mammalian nonsense mRNA. Studies have shown that mammalian NMD targets can be degraded via both an SMG6 (where SMG is suppressor of morphological defects on genitalia)-dependent endonucleolytic pathway and a deadenylation and decapping-dependent exonucleolytic pathway, with the possible involvement of SMG5 and SMG7. In contrast, Drosophila melanogaster NMD is confined to the former and Saccharomyces cerevisiae NMD to the latter decay pathway. Consistent with this conclusion, mammals possess both SMG6 and SMG7, whereas D. melanogaster lacks an SMG7 homologue and yeast have no SMG6 equivalent. In the present paper, we review what is known about the degradation of PTC-containing mRNAs so far, paying particular attention to the properties of the NMD-specific factors SMG5-SMG7 and to what is known about the mechanism of degrading mRNAs after they have been committed to the NMD pathway.",2010,"Pamela Nicholson, Oliver MÃ¼hlemann, Pamela Nicholson, Oliver MÃ¼hlemann"

The steroid molting hormone Ecdysone regulates sleep in adult Drosophila melanogaster,20215472,10.1534/genetics.110.114587,"Ecdysone is the major steroid hormone in insects and plays essential roles in coordinating developmental transitions such as larval molting and metamorphosis through its active metabolite 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). Although ecdysone is present throughout life in both males and females, its functions in adult physiology remain largely unknown. In this study we demonstrate that ecdysone-mediated signaling in the adult is intimately involved in transitions between the physiological states of sleep and wakefulness. First, administering 20E to adult Drosophila melanogaster promoted sleep in a dose-dependent manner, and it did so primarily by altering the length of sleep and wake bouts without affecting waking activity. Second, mutants for ecdysone synthesis displayed the ""short-sleep phenotype,"" and this was alleviated by administering 20E at the adult stage. Third, mutants for nuclear ecdysone receptors showed reduced sleep, and conditional overexpression of wild-type ecdysone receptors in the adult mushroom bodies resulted in an isoform-specific increase in sleep. Finally, endogenous ecdysone levels increased after sleep deprivation, and mutants defective for ecdysone signaling displayed little sleep rebound, suggesting that ecdysone is involved in homeostatic sleep regulation. In light of the recent finding that lethargus--a period at larval-stage transitions in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans--is a sleep-like state, our results suggest that sleep is functionally and mechanistically linked to a genetically programmed, quiescent behavioral state during development.",2010,"Hiroshi Ishimoto, Toshihiro Kitamoto, Hiroshi Ishimoto, Toshihiro Kitamoto"
Phosphorylation alters tau distribution and elongates life span in Drosophila,20555141,10.3233/JAD-2010-091678,"The microtubule-associated tau protein has long been considered an axon-specific protein.

Interestingly, it was observed that expression of phosphorylation-incompetent tau impaired neurite growth more severely than either hyperphosphorylated or pseudophosphorylated tau. We also found that inducible expression of hyper- or pseudo-phosphorylated tau in adult flies strikingly prolonged their lifespan. This study offers an alternative tauopathic model by demonstrating that hyperphosphorylated tau has a beneficial effect on the nervous system. This is also corroborated by common effects seen in a variety of organisms in response to various stresses.

Molecular evolution and functional characterization of Drosophila insulin-like peptides,20195512,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000857,"Multicellular animals match costly activities, such as growth and reproduction, to the environment through nutrient-sensing pathways. The insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) pathway plays key roles in growth, metabolism, stress resistance, reproduction, and longevity in diverse organisms including mammals. Invertebrate genomes often contain multiple genes encoding insulin-like ligands, including seven Drosophila insulin-like peptides (DILPs). We investigated the evolution, diversification, redundancy, and functions of the DILPs, combining evolutionary analysis, based on the completed genome sequences of 12 Drosophila species, and functional analysis, based on newly-generated knock-out mutations for all 7 dilp genes in D. melanogaster. Diversification of the 7 DILPs preceded diversification of Drosophila species, with stable gene diversification and family membership, suggesting stabilising selection for gene function. Gene knock-outs demonstrated both synergy and compensation of expression between different DILPs, notably with DILP3 required for normal expression of DILPs 2 and 5 in brain neurosecretory cells and expression of DILP6 in the fat body compensating for loss of brain DILPs. Loss of DILP2 increased lifespan and loss of DILP6 reduced growth, while loss of DILP7 did not affect fertility, contrary to its proposed role as a Drosophila relaxin. Importantly, loss of DILPs produced in the brain greatly extended lifespan but only in the presence of the endosymbiontic bacterium Wolbachia, demonstrating a specific interaction between IIS and Wolbachia in lifespan regulation. Furthermore, loss of brain DILPs blocked the responses of lifespan and fecundity to dietary restriction (DR) and the DR response of these mutants suggests that IIS extends lifespan through mechanisms that both overlap with those of DR and through additional mechanisms that are independent of those at work in DR. Evolutionary conservation has thus been accompanied by synergy, redundancy, and functional differentiation between DILPs, and these features may themselves be of evolutionary advantage.",2010,"Sebastian GrÃ¶nke, David-Francis Clarke, Susan Broughton, T Daniel Andrews, Linda Partridge, Sebastian GrÃ¶nke, David-Francis Clarke, Susan Broughton, T Daniel Andrews, Linda Partridge"
Sex determination in Drosophila: The view from the top,20160499,10.4161/fly.4.1.11277,"One of the most important decisions in development is whether to be male or female. In Drosophila melanogaster, most cells make this choice independent of their neighbors such that diploid cells with one X chromosome (XY) are male and those with two X chromosomes (XX) are female. X-chromosome number is relayed through regulatory proteins that act together to activate Sex-lethal (Sxl) in XX animals. The resulting SXL female specific RNA binding protein modulates the expression of a set of downstream genes, ultimately leading to sexually dimorphic structures and behaviors. Despite the apparent simplicity of this mechanism, Sxl activity is controlled by a host of transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms that tailor its function to specific developmental scenarios. This review describes recent advances in our understanding of Sxl regulation and function, highlighting work that challenges some of the textbook views about this classical (often cited, yet poorly understood) binary switch gene.",2010,"Helen K Salz, James W Erickson, Helen K Salz, James W Erickson"
Functional consequences of mutations in the Drosophila histamine receptor HCLB,19716373,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2009.08.016,"The gene hclB encodes a histamine-gated chloride channel subunit in Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations in hclB lead to defects in the visual system and altered sensitivity to the action of ivermectin. To investigate whether this member of the Cys-loop receptors is common across the Insecta, we analysed the genomes of seven other insect species (Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera) and revealed orthologues of hclB in all of them. Sequence comparisons showed high identity levels between the orthologues, indicating similar constraints and conserved function between the species. Two D. melanogaster mutants, hclB(T1) (P293S) and hclB(T2) (W111*, a null mutation) were tested for the lapse into, and recovery from, paralysis induced by high temperature or the anaesthetic action of halothane. At 41 degrees C, the hclB(T2) flies lapsed into coma faster than wild-type or the hclB(T1) flies, while both mutants recovered more slowly. A substantially impaired recovery rate was also observed in hclB(T1) after anaesthesia with halothane.

Evidence that adaptation in Drosophila is not limited by mutation at single sites,20585551,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000924,"Adaptation in eukaryotes is generally assumed to be mutation-limited because of small effective population sizes. This view is difficult to reconcile, however, with the observation that adaptation to anthropogenic changes, such as the introduction of pesticides, can occur very rapidly. Here we investigate adaptation at a key insecticide resistance locus (Ace) in Drosophila melanogaster and show that multiple simple and complex resistance alleles evolved quickly and repeatedly within individual populations. Our results imply that the current effective population size of modern D. melanogaster populations is likely to be substantially larger (> or = 100-fold) than commonly believed. This discrepancy arises because estimates of the effective population size are generally derived from levels of standing variation and thus reveal long-term population dynamics dominated by sharp--even if infrequent--bottlenecks. The short-term effective population sizes relevant for strong adaptation, on the other hand, might be much closer to census population sizes. Adaptation in Drosophila may therefore not be limited by waiting for mutations at single sites, and complex adaptive alleles can be generated quickly without fixation of intermediate states. Adaptive events should also commonly involve the simultaneous rise in frequency of independently generated adaptive mutations. These so-called soft sweeps have very distinct effects on the linked neutral polymorphisms compared to the standard hard sweeps in mutation-limited scenarios. Methods for the mapping of adaptive mutations or association mapping of evolutionarily relevant mutations may thus need to be reconsidered.",2010,"Talia Karasov, Philipp W Messer, Dmitri A Petrov, Talia Karasov, Philipp W Messer, Dmitri A Petrov"
Germline self-renewal requires cyst stem cells and stat regulates niche adhesion in Drosophila testes,20622868,10.1038/ncb2086,"Adults maintain tissue-specific stem cells through niche signals. A model for niche function is the Drosophila melanogaster testis, where a small cluster of cells called the hub produce locally available signals that allow only adjacent cells to self-renew. We show here that the principal signalling pathway implicated in this niche, chemokine activation of STAT, does not primarily regulate self-renewal of germline stem cells (GSCs), but rather governs GSC adhesion to hub cells. In fact, GSC renewal does not require hub cell contact, as GSCs can be renewed solely by contact with the second resident stem cell population, somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs), and this involves BMP signalling. These data suggest a modified paradigm whereby the hub cells function as architects of the stem cell environment, drawing into proximity cellular components necessary for niche function. Self-renewal functions are shared by the hub cells and the CySCs. This work also reconciles key differences in GSC renewal between Drosophila testis and ovary niches, and highlights how a niche can coordinate the production of distinct lineages by having one stem cell type rely on a second.",2010,"Judith L Leatherman, Stephen Dinardo, Judith L Leatherman, Stephen Dinardo"

Molecular genetics of a three-gene cluster in the Amy region of Drosophila,1697417,,"Analysis of amylase RNA levels in the anterior and posterior midgut regions of flies from the Amy1,6 mapA and c Amy2,3 mapC strains of D. melanogaster, reared on yeast and on yeast supplemented with glucose, indicates that the trans-acting map gene controls the abundance of amylase RNA tissue-specifically, i.e., in the adult posterior midgut. This is consistent with the view that its role in controlling Amy expression is that of a transcription factor. Dietary glucose represses Amy expression in the anterior and posterior midgut regions of adults, reducing the abundance of amylase RNA, which suggests that it also controls Amy transcriptional activity. However, the mechanism for glucose repression appears to act systemically in the midgut, in a manner that is independent of the effects of map on Amy expression. A new glucose repressible TU was identified that is located just proximal to the Amy locus in region 54A of polytene chromosome 2R. It is transcribed in the direction opposite to that of the proximal Amy gene and encodes an RNA about 1500 bases long. Its RNA is expressed in both larvae and adults of the above strains of D. melanogaster, but the nature of the product it encodes is unknown. We speculate that all three genes in the cluster at 54A, namely the two Amy gene copies and the new glucose repressible TU, are coordinately controlled by the same mechanism that regulates Amy gene expression in response to dietary glucose. Somatic transformation experiments suggest that 5' cis-regulatory mechanisms required for the correct spatial expression of the proximal and distal Amylase genes from a Canton-S strain of D. melanogaster, Amy-p1 and Amy-d3, are located within 450 bp and 463 bp of their respective translation start sites. These regions also contain sequences responsive to dietary glucose repression, which is mediated at the DNA level of exogenous Amy genes in somatically transformed larvae reared on a yeast + glucose diet. A positive activator is located in the upstream region of Amy-d3 between the nucleotide pairs at -365 and -252 from the translation start site, but a comparable activator does not appear to exist in the upstream region of Amy-p1. Deletion analysis of the 5' sequence flanking the coding region of Amy-d3 indicates 125 nucleotide pairs of flanking DNA is sufficient for its functional activity. A model is proposed for coordinate control, in part, of the duplicated Amy genes.",1990,"W W Doane, D B Thompson, R A Norman, S A Hawley, W W Doane, D B Thompson, R A Norman, S A Hawley"
Closely related DNA sequences specify distinct patterns of developmental expression in Drosophila melanogaster,2111452,10.1128/mcb.10.6.3272,"Three short synthetic DNA sequences, which are closely related to one another, confer three distinct patterns of developmental expression on the heat shock hsp70 gene in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster lines. These results show that small variations or even single base pair changes in a repeated element of a regulatory sequence can create promoters that display new specificities of tissue and developmental regulation. Interestingly, the three patterns of developmental expression conferred by the synthetic DNAs resemble in part those of the known developmental genes: glucose dehydrogenase (Gld), Dopa decarboxylase (Ddc), and salivary gland secretory proteins (Sgs), respectively. In each case, the defined regulatory region of the known developmental gene contains multiple sequences that are similar or identical to the synthetic sequence that confers a similar pattern of developmental expression on the hsp70 gene. Thus, these results are congruent with the view that short sequence elements in multiple copies can confer either simple or relatively complex patterns of developmental expression on a receptive promoter like that of hsp70. Furthermore, the fact that the three variants tested produced three distinct patterns of expression in transgenic animals suggests that the number of different elements is large.",1990,"H Xiao, J T Lis, H Xiao, J T Lis"

No essential distinction in recombination frequency was revealed in variants studied under the temperature 21-22 degrees C.

The transposable element Uhu from Hawaiian Drosophila--member of the widely dispersed class of Tc1-like transposons,2159635,10.1093/nar/18.8.2053,"We report the complete nucleotide sequence of the transposable element Uhu from the vicinity of the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene of Drosophila heteroneura (an endemic Hawaiian Drosophila). The complete element is about 1650 base-pairs (bp) long, has 46-50 base-pair inverse imperfect repeats at it's ends, and contains a large open reading frame potentially encoding a 192 amino acid protein. We demonstrate that Uhu belongs to a class of transposable elements which includes Tc1 from Caenorhabditis elegans, Barney from Caenorhabditis briggsae, and HB1 from Drosophila melanogaster.

"[Amplification of subtelomeric sequences in ""long"" telomers of Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes]",2115486,,"Drosophila melanogaster heat-resistant stock T32 is characterized by additional chromatin in the telomeres of the X and 2L chromosomes. Moreover, elevated (32 degrees C) temperature provokes high instability in the telomere morphology, so that sublines can be obtained which have additional chromatin in different chromosomes. Morphological patterns of telomeres in each subline are stable, if flies are kept at 23 degrees C. It was demonstrated using this model that additional chromatin in the ""long"" telomeres hybridizes actively with 3H-labelled telomere-associated Dm665 probe. The ""short"" telomeres show far weaker hybridization, if any, with Dm665. This means that morphological changes in the telomeres of polytene chromosomes result from different degree amplification of the telomere-associated sequences.",1990,"O N Danilevskaia, G E Lapta, O N Danilevskaia, G E Lapta"
A maximum likelihood approach to the detection of selection from a phylogeny,2176699,10.1007/BF02102078,"A large amount of information is contained within the phylogenetic relationships between species. In addition to their branching patterns it is also possible to examine other aspects of the biology of the species. The influence that deleterious selection might have is determined here. The likelihood of different phylogenies in the presence of selection is explored to determine the properties of such a likelihood surface. The calculation of likelihoods for a phylogeny in the presence and absence of selection, permits the application of a likelihood ratio test to search for selection. It is shown that even a single selected site can have a strong effect on the likelihood. The method is illustrated with an example from Drosophila melanogaster and suggests that deleterious selection may be acting on transposable elements.",1990,"B Golding, J Felsenstein, B Golding, J Felsenstein"
Structure and expression of the Drosophila melanogaster gene for the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle 70K protein,1692955,10.1128/mcb.10.6.2492,"A genomic clone encoding the Drosophila U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle 70K protein was isolated by hybridization with a human U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle 70K protein cDNA. Southern blot and in situ hybridizations showed that this U1 70K gene is unique in the Drosophila genome, residing at cytological position 27D1,2. Polyadenylated transcripts of 1.9 and 3.1 kilobases were observed. While the 1.9-kilobase mRNA is always more abundant, the ratio of these two transcripts is developmentally regulated. Analysis of cDNA and genomic sequences indicated that these two RNAs encode an identical protein with a predicted molecular weight of 52,879. Comparison of the U1 70K proteins predicted from Drosophila, human, and Xenopus cDNAs revealed 68% amino acid identity in the most amino-terminal 214 amino acids, which include a sequence motif common to many proteins which bind RNA. The carboxy-terminal half is less well conserved but is highly charged and contains distinctive arginine-rich regions in all three species. These arginine-rich regions contain stretches of arginine-serine dipeptides like those found in transformer, transformer-2, and suppressor-of-white-apricot proteins, all of which have been identified as regulators of mRNA splicing in Drosophila melanogaster.",1990,"R Mancebo, P C Lo, S M Mount, R Mancebo, P C Lo, S M Mount"
Molecular analysis of evolutionary changes in the expression of Drosophila esterases,1700427,10.1073/pnas.87.21.8217,"Drosophila melanogaster transformed with the esterase 5 (Est-5) gene from Drosophila pseudoobscura were used to assess the evolutionary basis for differences in the sex- and tissue-specific expression of the esterase 5 (EST 5) enzyme in D. pseudoobscura relative to its homologue in D. melanogaster, EST 6. EST 5 is expressed in the eyes and hemolymph of transformed D. melanogaster just as it is in D. pseudoobscura, but it is not detectable in the ejaculatory duct, where the homologous enzyme, EST 6, is most abundant. EST 5 also occurs at equal levels in both sexes of the transformants and D. pseudoobscura, whereas EST 6 is more abundant in male than in female D. melanogaster. Northern analysis of transformed and untransformed flies indicates that the expression patterns of EST 5 and EST 6 are controlled at the level of transcription and suggests that regulatory differences between Est-6 and Est-5 have evolved mainly through cis-acting regulatory changes in the two loci rather than through alterations in trans-acting factors. Equal expression of EST 5 in male and female transformants also indicates that the X-chromosome-linked Est-5 gene of D. pseudoobscura, when isolated as a 4.5-kilobase restriction fragment, is not dosage compensated after integration into an autosome of D. melanogaster.",1990,"J P Brady, R C Richmond"

Contrary to the predicted lower level of variation for genes on the X chromosome, the level of variation attributable to nucleotide substitution (estimated heterozygosity/nucleotide = 0.004) was similar to that previously reported for autosomal loci. The amount of insertion/deletion variation in the studied region was within the range observed in autosomal regions and thus not explainable by a simple selection model against the effects of insertional mutations.

Doc is a member of the class of transposable elements known as retroposons, which includes the D. melanogaster F, G, Jockey, and I elements. There is no sequence homology between the ends of the Doc element. The 3' or right end terminates with a polyadenylation signal sequence followed by a stretch of oligo-A. The length of the oligo-A varies between elements, and a duplication of variable size is found as a direct repeat flanking inserted Doc elements. Members of the family are conserved at the 3' end, but may be truncated at the 5' or left end.

Overlapping genes of Drosophila melanogaster: organization of the z600-gonadal-Eip28/29 gene cluster,2497054,10.1101/gad.3.2.232,"The Drosophila gonadal (gdl) gene is a member of a gene cluster that maps cytogenetically to the 71CD interval of chromosome 3. The gene is bordered distally by z600, a gene expressed predominantly during early embryogenesis, and proximally by Eip28/29, a gene regulated by ecdysone in Drosophila cell lines. gdl can be expressed in either of two modes in adults: gdlF expression leads to the transcripts 1300 and 1000, which are found in the ovaries, whereas gdlM expression leads to the transcripts 1500 and 1200, which are found in the testes. In situ hybridization analysis reveals that this expression occurs in the germ line during oogenesis and spermatogenesis. Structural studies identify an unusual gdl sequence organization. The ovarian and testes transcripts differ at their 5' ends because of the utilization of different transcription initiation sites. This result indicates that alternative promoter usage is responsible for sex-specific gdl expression. Within an expression mode, the two transcripts differ at their 3' ends as a result of multiple polyadenylation site usage; one of these sites resides within the 5' exon of the Eip28/29 gene. gdl is overlapped by z600 as well because the z600 transcript is polyadenylated at position +91 of the gdlM transcripts. An analysis of germ-line transformants reveals that gdl can be expressed properly outside the overlapping gene environment because a 1.8-kb DNA region contains all the sequences necessary for gdl sex-specific expression.",1989,"R A Schulz, B A Butler, R A Schulz, B A Butler"
Tissue specific expression of the acetylcholinesterase gene in Drosophila melanogaster,2511423,10.1007/BF00332414,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is mainly membrane bound in the central nervous system (CNS) of larvae and in the head and thorax of adults of Drosophila melanogaster; it is mostly soluble in the larval carcass, the adult abdomen, similar to that of the embryos (Zador et al. 1986). The enzyme shows the same number of isozymes (four or five) in larvae and adults as in the head of the fly or in embryos (Zador et al. 1986). In the Df(3R)GE26/MKRS stock both the membrane bound and the soluble enzyme are at about half normal levels while in the Df(3R)AceHD1/MKRS stock this is true only for the membrane bound AChE.

Co-localization to chromosome bands 99E1-3 of the Drosophila melanogaster myosin light chain-2 gene and a haplo-insufficient locus that affects flight behavior,2471669,,"Using overlapping synthetic deficiencies, we find that a haplo-insufficient locus affecting flight behavior and the myosin light chain-2 gene co-map to the Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosome interval 99D9-E1 to 99E2-3. From screening over 9000 EMS-treated chromosomes, we obtained alleles of two complementation groups that map to this same interval. One of these complementation groups lfm(3)99Eb, exhibits dominant flightless behavior; thus, flightless behavior of the deficiency is in all likelihood due to hemizygosity of this single locus. Rescue of flightless behavior by a duplication indicates that the single allele, E38, of the Ifm(3)99Eb complementation group is a hypomorph. Based upon its map position and a reduction in concentration of myosin light chain-2 mRNA in heterozygotes, we propose that Ifm(3)Eb(E38) is a mutant allele of the myosin light chain-2 gene. Our genetic analysis also resulted in the identification of four dominant flightless alleles of an unlinked locus, l(3)nc99Eb, that exhibits dominant lethal synergism with Ifm(3)99Eb.",1989,"J W Warmke, A J Kreuz, S Falkenthal, J W Warmke, A J Kreuz, S Falkenthal"

This is due to dosage compensation of the Notch locus. Secondly, it was observed that in general an increasing dose of the wild allele decreased the expression of Abruptex at all temperatures. An exception was the Axtsl/Axtsl/ + genotype, which was more expressed than Axtsl/Axtsl at low temperatures. This suggests antimorphism as the most likely mode of action of the temperature sensitive Abruptex mutation. Thirdly, it was observed that the expression of Abruptex phenotype increased from 18 degrees C to 25 degrees C but decreased from 25 degrees C to 29 degrees C if the wild type allele was involved in the genotype. This suggests that the gene product of the temperature sensitive Abruptex allele loses its function at high temperatures.

The cDNA encoding this sodium pump alpha-subunit in Drosophila melanogaster was cloned, sequenced and expressed in mouse L cells. At the amino acid level, its deduced sequence of 1038 residues (the first such sequence for an invertebrate) is approximately 80% similar to alpha-subunit sequences reported for vertebrates.

A long interspersed repetitive element--the I factor of Drosophila teissieri--is able to transpose in different Drosophila species,2554335,10.1073/pnas.86.22.8887,"Long interspersed repetitive elements (LINEs) are transposable elements present in many species. In mammals they are difficult to study because most of them are defective and their transposition frequency is low. The I factor of Drosophila melanogaster is a LINE element that is particularly interesting because its transposition occurs at high frequency during I-R hybrid dysgenesis. This phenomenon occurs when males from the class of inducer strains are crossed with females from the class of reactive strains. Inducer strains contain several complete 5.4-kilobase I factors at various sites on the chromosomal arms. Reactive strains are devoid of complete I factors. Many results indicate that active I factors have invaded the D. melanogaster genome recently. To study the evolutionary history of I elements, we have cloned and sequenced a potentially active I factor from Drosophila teissieri. It is flanked by a target-site duplication and terminates at the 3' end by tandem repeats of the sequence TAA. When introduced into the germ line of a reactive strain of D. melanogaster by P element-mediated transformation, it is able to transpose and induces hybrid dysgenesis. This strengthens the hypothesis of a recent reinvasion of the D. melanogaster genome by active I factors giving rise to the inducer strains. They could have originated by horizontal transfer from another species. Such events also could occur for other LINE elements and might explain the spread of new variants in mammalian genomes. Moreover, the results give a further insight into I factor functional organization.",1989,"P Abad, C Vaury, A PÃ©lisson, M C Chaboissier, I Busseau, A Bucheton, P Abad, C Vaury, A PÃ©lisson, M C Chaboissier, I Busseau, A Bucheton"

The ultrastructural morphology of native salivary gland chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster: the band-interband question,3103992,10.1007/BF00328641,"Native salivary gland chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster, isolated without exposure to acid fixatives, have been examined in regions 1A-3B, 15A-17B, 19B-20D and 71E-73A and reveal improved aspects of preservation at the ultrastructural level. Three main points emerge: fine bands are well preserved allowing detection of some not recorded in maps made on classical acid-fixed preparations. Structures with the morphology of putative nascent ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles are apparent in puffs, diffuse bands and virtually all interbands observed. At this level the morphology of native chromosomes is consistent with the hypothesis that all decondensed regions are members of a continuum of transcriptionally active structures. This notion is relevant to data obtained from other approaches to the band-interband question. (iii) Although the chromosomes have not been exposed to 45% acetic acid, at least some of the dark bands represented by the Bridges as doublets in their classical maps contain vacuoles which include putative RNP particles.",1986,"M R Mott, R J Hill, M R Mott, R J Hill"

Expression of the white-apricot (wa) allele of Drosophila melanogaster, which carries an insertion of the 5.1-kilobase retrovirus-like transposable element copia in a small intron, is influenced by signals within copia. By using this indicator, we have isolated a 518-base-pair deletion, 312 base pairs upstream of the copia polyadenylylation site, that is phenotypically like much larger deletions and eliminates RNA species polyadenylylated in copia. This requirement of distant upstream sequences for copia polyadenylylation has implications for the expression of many genetic elements bearing long terminal repeats.",1991,"M Kurkulos, J M Weinberg, M E Pepling, S M Mount, M Kurkulos, J M Weinberg, M E Pepling, S M Mount"

The lethal(1)TW-6cs mutation of Drosophila melanogaster is a dominant antimorphic allele of nod and is associated with a single base change in the putative ATP-binding domain,1743485,,"The l(1)TW-6cs mutation is a cold-sensitive recessive lethal mutation in Drosophila melanogaster, that affects both meiotic and mitotic chromosome segregation. We report the isolation of three revertants of this mutation. All three revert both the meiotic and mitotic effects as well as the cold sensitivity, demonstrating that all three phenotypes are due to a single lesion. We further show that these revertants fail to complement an amorphic allele of the nod (no distributive disjunction) locus, which encodes a kinesin-like protein. These experiments demonstrate that l(1)TW-6cs is an antimorphic allele of nod, and we rename it nodDTW. Sequencing of the nod locus on a nodDTW-bearing chromosome reveals a single base change in the putative ATP-binding region of the motor domain of nod. Recessive, loss-of-function mutations at the nod locus specifically disrupt the segregation of nonexchange chromosomes in female meiosis. We demonstrate that, at 23.5 degrees, the meiotic defects in nodDTW/+ females are similar to those observed in nod/nod females; that is, the segregation of nonexchange chromosomes is abnormal. However, in nodDTW/nodDTW females, or in nodDTW/+ females at 18 degrees, we observe a more severe meiotic defect that apparently affects the segregation of both exchange and nonexchange chromosomes. In addition, nodDTW homozygotes and hemizygous males have previously been shown to exhibit mitotic defects including somatic chromosome breakage and loss. We propose that the defective protein encoded by the nodDTW allele interferes with proper chromosome movement during both meiosis and mitosis, perhaps by binding irreversibly to microtubules.",1991,"R S Rasooly, C M New, P Zhang, R S Hawley, B S Baker, R S Rasooly, C M New, P Zhang, R S Hawley, B S Baker"

The gene has an intron in the 5' untranslated region of the transcript and a second intron in the coding region at an evolutionarily conserved position. Transcripts initiate at a single site which does not have a TATA box in the usual position. Northern blot analysis of RNA prepared from different developmental stages revealed that Tpi mRNA is present in substantial amounts in oocytes, declines in abundance in early embryos, and begins to increase during mid-embryogenesis.

Female sterile mutations on the second chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster. II. Mutations blocking oogenesis or altering egg morphology,1783295,,"In mutagenesis screens for recessive female sterile mutations on the second chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster 528 lines were isolated which allow the homozygous females to survive but cause sterility. In 62 of these lines early stages of oogenesis are affected, and these females usually do not lay any eggs. In 333 lines oogenesis proceeds apparently normally to stage 8 of oogenesis, but morphological defects become often apparent during later stages of oogenesis, and are visible in the defective eggs produced by these females whereas 133 lay eggs that appear morphologically normal, but do not support normal embryonic development. Of the lines 341 have been genetically characterized and define a total of 140 loci on the second chromosome. Not all the loci are specific for oogenesis. From the numbers obtained we estimate that the second chromosome of Drosophila contains about 13 loci that are relatively specific for early oogenesis, 70 loci that are specifically required in mid to late oogenesis, and around 30 maternal-effect lethals.",1991,"T SchÃ¼pbach, E Wieschaus, T SchÃ¼pbach, E Wieschaus"
The effect of modifiers of position-effect variegation on the variegation of heterochromatic genes of Drosophila melanogaster,1916244,,"Dominant modifiers of position-effect variegation of Drosophila melanogaster were tested for their effects on the variegation of genes normally located in heterochromatin. These modifiers were previously isolated as strong suppressors of the variegation of euchromatic genes and have been postulated to encode structural components of heterochromatin or other products that influence chromosome condensation. While eight of the modifiers had weak or no detectable effects, six acted as enhancers of light (lt) variegation. The two modifiers with the strongest effects on lt were shown to also enhance the variegation of neighboring heterochromatic genes. These results suggest that the wild-type gene products of some modifiers of position-effect variegation are required for proper expression of genes normally located within or near the heterochromatin of chromosome 2. We conclude that these heterochromatic genes have fundamentally different regulatory requirements compared to those typical of euchromatic genes.",1991,"M G Hearn, A Hedrick, T A Grigliatti, B T Wakimoto, M G Hearn, A Hedrick, T A Grigliatti, B T Wakimoto"

Lifespan was determined in two strains of male and female Drosophila raised at 19 degrees, 24 degrees, and 29 degrees C. The results show an inverse relationship between lifespan and temperature. In addition, lipid peroxidation rates and superoxide dismutase activity were measured in homogenates and phospholipase A2 activity was determined in crude membrane samples prepared from this species. Temperature was found to be directly correlated with the rate of lipid peroxidation in each group. The longest-lived group, wild-type females, exhibited the lowest rate of lipid peroxidation at each temperature; whereas the shortest-lived group, vestigial wing males, displayed the highest rates of lipid peroxidation. Older (40-53 day) vestigial wing males also exhibited significantly higher superoxide dismutase activity than younger vestigial wing males (0-5 day) and higher phospholipase A2 activity than wild-type females of the same age. These results indicate that there is an association between lipid peroxidation rates and lifespan in Drosophila, and that aging changes may include an increase in superoxide dismutase and phospholipase A2 activity. These findings agree with the hypothesis that free radicals are involved in the aging process in Drosophila.",1991,"E A Sestini, J C Carlson, R Allsopp, E A Sestini, J C Carlson, R Allsopp"

"Evidence for retrotransposition of the I factor, a LINE element of Drosophila melanogaster",1647020,10.1073/pnas.88.11.4907,"LINEs are transposable elements found in various eukaryotes such as plants, protists, insects, and mammals. Their transposition is usually difficult to study, particularly in humans, where some diseases have been shown to result from LINE insertion mutations. This is due to the fact that most copies of any particular family of elements are defective and that their transposition frequency is low. By contrast, the I factor of Drosophila melanogaster transposes at high frequency during I-R hybrid dysgenesis and is a good model for studying the LINE element superfamily. LINEs encode putative polypeptides showing similarities with viral reverse transcriptases but, unlike viral retrotransposons, they do not have terminal repeats and their ability to transpose by reverse transcription has previously only been inferred from structural analysis. Here we present direct evidence for LINE retrotransposition.

Genetic and molecular analysis of repression in the P-M system of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,1653752,10.1017/s0016672300029360,"Twelve inbred lines derived from an M' strain of Drosophila melanogaster were used to study the repression of P-element-mediated hybrid dysgenesis. Initial assessments indicated that the lines differed in the ability to repress gonadal dysgenesis, and that this ability was highly correlated with the ability to repress snw hypermutability. Later assessments indicated that most of the lines with low or intermediate repression potential evolved to a state of higher repression potential; however, Southern analyses failed to reveal significant changes in the array of genomic P elements that could account for this evolution. In addition, none of the lines possessed the incomplete P element known as KP, which has been proposed to explain repression in some D. melanogaster strains. One of the lines maintained intermediate repression potential throughout the period of study (52 generations), indicating that the intermediate condition was not intrinsically unstable. Genetic analyses demonstrated that in some of the lines, repression potential was influenced by factors that were inherited maternally through at least two generations; however, these factors were not as influential as those in a classic P cytotype strain. Additional tests with a dysgenesis-inducing X chromosome called T-5 indicated that repression itself was mediated by a combination of maternal effects and paternally inherited factors that were expressed after fertilization. These tests also suggested that in some circumstances, the P transposase, or its message, might be transmitted through the maternal cytoplasm.",1991,"E M Heath, M J Simmons, E M Heath, M J Simmons"
Distribution of hobo transposable elements in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster,1712890,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040649,"Forty-six strains derived from American and French natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster were tested for the presence and activity of hobo elements by using Southern blotting and a gonadal dysgenesis assay. The oldest available strains exhibited weak detectable hybridization to the hobo-element probe and revealed neither hobo-activity potential nor hobo-repression potential. In contrast, all recently collected strains harbored hobo sequences and revealed a strong hobo-repression potential but no strong hobo-activity potential. On the basis of restriction-enzyme analysis, old strains appear to have numerous fragments hybridizable to hobo sequences, several probably conserved at the same locations in the genome of the tested strain and others dispersed. In recently isolated strains, and unlike the situation in the published sequence of the cloned hobo108 element, a PvuII site is present in the great majority of full-sized hobo elements and their deletion derivatives. When the genetic and molecular characteristics are considered together, the available evidence is consistent with the hypothesis of a worldwide hobo-element invasion of D. melanogaster during the past 50 years. Comparison of data from the I-R and P-M systems suggests that the putative invasion followed the introduction of the I element but preceded that of the P element. This hypothesis poses the problem of the plausibility of three virtually simultaneous element invasions in this species. Such a possibility might be due to a modification of the genetic structure of American populations of D. melanogaster during the first part of the 20th century.",1991,"L Pascual, G Periquet, L Pascual, G Periquet"
"A highly repetitive, mariner-like element in the genome of Hyalophora cecropia",1646809,,"A highly repetitive DNA element, homologous to the mariner transposon of Drosophila mauritiana was found in the intron of the gene for cecropin A, an antibacterial peptide from the Cecropia moth. The mariner-like elements (MLE) represent a homogeneous population with a copy number of about 1000/genome. Sequencing analysis showed it to be 1255 base pairs long, including 38-base pair terminal inverted repeats. The MLE contains a defective reading frame. Nevertheless, the putative product is clearly homologous to the predicted translation product encoded by mariner. In consonance is also the fact that the inverted repeats are highly conserved between the two elements and that the overall DNA homology is 48%. Since the mariner element is present in several Drosophila species closely related to Drosophila melanogaster and since MLE is present in the lepidopteran Cecropia, a route of horizontal transfer is indicated rather than vertical transmission from a common ancestor. This suggests the possible use of mariner for the construction of an interspecies vector.",1991,"D A Lidholm, G H Gudmundsson, H G Boman, D A Lidholm, G H Gudmundsson, H G Boman"
Evolution of the transposable element mariner in Drosophila species,1649069,,"The distribution of the transposable element mariner was examined in the genus Drosophila. Among the eight species comprising the melanogaster species subgroup, the element is present in D. mauritiana, D. simulans, D. sechellia, D. yakuba and D. teissieri, but it is absent in D. melanogaster, D. erecta and D. orena. Multiple copies of mariner were sequenced from each species in which the element occurs. The inferred phylogeny of the elements and the pattern of divergence were examined in order to evaluate whether horizontal transfer among species or stochastic loss could better account for the discontinuous distribution of the element among the species. The data suggest that the element was present in the ancestral species before the melanogaster subgroup diverged and was lost in the lineage leading to D. melanogaster and the lineage leading to D. erecta and D. orena. This inference is consistent with the finding that mariner also occurs in members of several other species subgroups within the overall melanogaster species group. Within the melanogaster species subgroup, the average divergence of mariner copies between species was lower than the coding region of the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene. However, the divergence of mariner elements within species was as great as that observed for Adh. We conclude that the relative sequence homogeneity of mariner elements within species is more likely a result of rapid amplification of a few ancestral elements than of concerted evolution. The mariner element may also have had unequal mutation rates in different lineages.",1991,"K Maruyama, D L Hartl, K Maruyama, D L Hartl"
"Preferential Y chromosomal location of TRIM, a novel transposable element of Drosophila miranda, obscura group",1665124,10.1007/BF00355366,"We have isolated a novel transposable element from the Y chromosome of Drosophila miranda (obscura group) which shows an organization intermediate between that of typical retroviruses and the I factor of Drosophila melanogaster. The site of integration of this element, TRIM, is an inverted repeat. On the 5' side the central region of TRIM is bordered by a sequence homologous to the tRNA primer binding site (PBS) and on the 3' side by a sequence homologous to the polypurine tract (PPT). The 5' LTR (long terminal repeat) contains transcription signals, such as a TATA box and a polyadenylation sequence. Three long open reading frames (ORFs) are found within the central region of the transposon. ORF1 and ORF2 show amino acid homology to the I factor of D. melanogaster and to conserved amino acid residues of retroviral reverse transcriptases. When used as a probe for in situ hybridization the TRIM element labels about 25 euchromatic sites and the chromocenter in polytene nuclei of D. miranda females. In the chromosome complement of males the polytenized part of the Y chromosome shows about the same number of additional TRIM homologous elements. Thus, as a result of this enrichment of TRIM elements in the Y chromosome, the genomic size of the TRIM population in D. miranda males is approximately doubled.",1991,"M Steinemann, S Steinemann, M Steinemann, S Steinemann"
Splicing of retrotransposon insertions from transcripts of the Drosophila melanogaster vermilion gene in a revertant,1664404,,"A mutation of the Drosophila melanogaster vermilion (v) gene known as v1 is caused by the insertion of a 412 retrotransposon into the 5' untranslated region of the first exon. Mutants carrying this insertion accumulate a low level of mRNA from which most of the transposon sequences have been eliminated by splicing at cryptic sites within transposon sequences. Here, we demonstrate that a revertant of the v1 allele called v+37 is caused by the insertion of a second retrotransposon, the B104/roo element, into a site near one end of the 412 element. The revertant strain accumulates a higher level of mRNA from which most of both transposons have been removed by splicing at new donor sites introduced by the B104/roo insertion and the same acceptor site within 412. Mutations at suppressor of sable [su(s)], which increase the accumulation of v1 transcripts, slightly elevate the level of v+37 RNA. In addition, we show that the first v intron downstream of the 412 insertion is not efficiently removed in the v1 mutant, and suppressor and reversion mutations increase the proportion of transcripts that are properly spliced at that downstream intron. Thus, it appears that both the suppressor and reversion mutations exert an effect at the level of pre-mRNA splicing.",1991,"A M Pret, L L Searles, A M Pret, L L Searles"
A cluster of vitellogenin genes in the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata: sequence and structural conservation in dipteran yolk proteins and their genes,1903120,,"Four genes encoding the major egg yolk polypeptides of the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata, vitellogenins 1 and 2 (VG1 and VG2), were cloned, characterized and partially sequenced. The genes are located on the same region of chromosome 5 and are organized in pairs, each encoding the two polypeptides on opposite DNA strands. Restriction and nucleotide sequence analysis indicate that the gene pairs have arisen from an ancestral pair by a relatively recent duplication event. The transcribed part is very similar to that of the Drosophila melanogaster yolk protein genes Yp1, Yp2 and Yp3. The Vg1 genes have two introns at the same positions as those in D. melanogaster Yp3; the Vg2 genes have only one of the introns, as do D. melanogaster Yp1 and Yp2. Comparison of the five polypeptide sequences shows extensive homology, with 27% of the residues being invariable. The sequence similarity of the processed proteins extends in two regions separated by a nonconserved region of varying size. Secondary structure predictions suggest a highly conserved secondary structure pattern in the two regions, which probably correspond to structural and functional domains. The carboxy-end domain of the C. capitata proteins shows the same sequence similarities with triacyglycerol lipases that have been reported previously for the D. melanogaster yolk proteins. Analysis of codon usage shows significant differences between D. melanogaster and C. capitata vitellogenins with the latter exhibiting a less biased representation of synonymous codons.",1991,"M Rina, C Savakis, M Rina, C Savakis"
Queuine metabolism and cadmium toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster,1905548,,"Queuine can replace guanine in the anticodon of certain tRNAs and is a hypermodified guanine derivative that can be synthesized by bacteria but not by mice. The study demonstrates that Drosophila can incorporate dietary queuine into tRNA but cannot synthesize it de novo for this purpose. Since an earlier study had shown that dietary CdCl2 caused Drosophila to increase greatly the proportion of queuine-containing tRNA over non-queuine tRNA the ability of dietary queuine to counteract cadmium toxicity was evaluated. When queuine was present in the cadmium-containing medium more pupae matured into adults than when queuine was absent. Other studies had demonstrated that the transglycosylase enzyme, that catalyzes the replacement of guanine in the anticodon of tRNA by queuine, is present in Drosophila larvae but the tRNA is virtually devoid of queuine. This study shows that in the presence of dietary queuine the larval tRNA contains abundant amounts of queuine. Therefore, we postulate a significant role for bacteria in supplying queuine to Drosophila for its incorporation into tRNA and that the control of this process by Drosophila is passive, i.e. is not an essential feature in differentiation.",1991,"T J Siard, K B Jacobson, W R Farkas, T J Siard, K B Jacobson, W R Farkas"

Molecular cloning and analysis of forked locus in Drosophila ananassae,1851948,10.1007/BF00273582,"Drosophila ananassae, in spite of its unique genetic characters including high mutability and high frequency of male recombination has been little studied at the molecular level. Since the species is very similar to D. melanogaster, it is natural to expect that the high spontaneous mutation rate and male recombination may be caused by inserted mobile DNA elements, as in D. melanogaster. The present study was designed to determine whether or not most spontaneous mutations of the forked locus of D. ananassae are caused by insertion sequences as is found in D. melanogaster. I cloned the forked locus of D. ananassae, using forked DNA from D. melanogaster as a probe and investigated the molecular structure and transcription of the gene by Southern and Northern analyses. The results suggest that the restriction map and transcriptional patterns of the forked locus of D. ananassae are similar to those of D. melanogaster, while the spontaneous mutations available in D. ananassae are induced quite differently from those that have been described in D. melanogaster; in four (f;cd, f10-14, f49 and f86) out of eight forked alleles, neither insertions nor deletions were detected around the forked coding region. Forked transcripts are expressed in a pattern which is very similar to that of D. melanogaster and were all of normal size in these mutants. The other four mutants (f10-3, f9-10, f83i and f79b) had insertion sequences upstream of the forked coding region, while transcripts of the forked gene were of normal size. Hence, none of the eight mutations studied appear to affect the structure of the forked transcripts.",1991,"Y Hatano, Y Hatano"

Cellar stocks tended to be more resistant to starvation after exposure to wine seepage than stocks originating from orchard traps outside the cellar. Lines from a grape residue pile were also more resistant to starvation after seepage exposure than orchard stocks even though these collection sites were a few meters apart. Cellar and orchard stocks did not differ in ethanol resistance as measured by larval viability tests on low sucrose medium. However, stocks from the grape residue pile showed an increase in adult longevity over ethanol vapor compared to those from the cellar or orchard stocks. These differences were not due to maternal effects. In laboratory tests of behavioral responses, cellar stocks were relatively more attracted to seepage than orchard stocks in one year but not in the other two years. The findings suggest some adaptive differentiation related to resource heterogeneity at Tahbilk.",1991,"Ary A Hoffmann, Stephen W McKechnie, Ary A Hoffmann, Stephen W McKechnie"
"Relationship between catalase activity, life span and some parameters associated with antioxidant defenses in Drosophila melanogaster",1351971,10.1016/0047-6374(92)90006-y,"This study was conducted on Drosophila melanogaster mutants with different levels of catalase activity in order to assess the role of antioxidant defenses in the aging process. We present here the analysis of two mutant strains: the catn1/catn4 heterozygote which exhibits no detectable catalase activity and the catn2 homozygote which exhibits approximately 14% that of the parent reference strain. Since insects lack glutathione peroxidase activity, catalase activity provides the sole enzymatic mechanism for the removal of H2O2. Average and maximum life spans of flies were unaffected by the absence or low levels of catalase activity. The mutants however exhibited adaptive responses in their metabolic rate or glutathione content. The metabolic rate of flies was significantly lowered in the null mutants. Glutathione concentration tended to increase in flies with the hypomorphic catalase allele (exhibiting 14% of the normal catalase activity). Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase activity was significantly higher in the null flies. Activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase were unaffected. Results of this study indicate that 14% of the normal level of catalase activity allows flies to achieve both a normal life span and a normal metabolic potential. Small decreases in certain antioxidant defenses, frequently observed during aging, may be functionally not very consequential.",1992,"W C Orr, L A Arnold, R S Sohal, W C Orr, L A Arnold, R S Sohal"

Genetic combinations involving mutations affecting the bxd region show that (1) redundant or cooperatively acting sequences are required for Ubx gene expression in the anterior compartment of the first abdominal segment, and (2) the expression of Ubx in the posterior compartment of the third thoracic segment is modulated by positive and negative cis-regulatory elements.",1992,"J E Castelli-Gair, M P Capdevila, J L Micol, A GarcÃ­a-Bellido, J E Castelli-Gair, M P Capdevila, J L Micol, A GarcÃ­a-Bellido"
Spontaneous mutations affecting glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme activity in Drosophila melanogaster,1524832,10.1266/jjg.67.125,"Significant genetic variance in glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity was observed between chromosome lines of Drosophila melanogaster that had each accumulated spontaneous mutations for approximately 300 generations. No restriction map variation was found in a 26-kb region surrounding the entire Gpdh gene. The restriction analysis used is capable of detecting insertions/deletions larger than 0.05 kb. The survey would also detect chromosomal recombinations that include the entire Gpdh coding region. Therefore, if the spontaneous mutations that affected the enzyme activity are located inside the Gpdh gene region, then they are base pair substitutions or structural changes that are smaller than the limit in resolution described above.",1992,"A Koga, K Harada, S Kusakabe, T Mukai, A Koga, K Harada, S Kusakabe, T Mukai"
Tissue-specific position effects on alcohol dehydrogenase expression in Drosophila melanogaster,1313145,10.1007/BF00299146,"Twenty transformed lines have been isolated as a result of the germ line insertion of a 3.2 kb alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene fragment into an Adh negative strain of Drosophila melanogaster by P element-mediated transformation. More than half of these lines exhibited abnormal ADH expression. The level of ADH expression ranges from zero in some lines to near normal levels in others, and the pattern of ADH expression in the larval gut is also abnormal in many of these lines. Each of the abnormal tissue-specific patterns is stable and characterized by the absence or reduction of ADH expression in certain tissues. High levels of ectopic expression were not observed. In two of these lines, the pattern of ADH staining is highly restricted: it is limited to the medial midgut in line MM-50, and to the gastric caecae and the proventriculus in line GC-1. In heterozygotes between these two lines ADH is expressed in both of these tissues. To test the hypothesis that this abnormal expression is due to position effects, inserts were mobilized to new locations. The mobilized inserts exhibited new patterns of tissue-specific expression associated with new cytological insert locations, showing that the abnormal expression in lines MM-50 and GC-1 is due to tissue-specific position effects and not to mutations. The results are discussed in the context of chromatin structure as a possible cause of these position effects.",1992,"R B Kirkpatrick, P F Martin, R B Kirkpatrick, P F Martin"
"Drosocrystallin, a major 52 kDa glycoprotein of the Drosophila melanogaster corneal lens. Purification, biochemical characterization, and subcellular localization",1400628,,"We have identified a 52 kDa protein, which is a potent substrate for cholera toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation, in the compound eye preparation of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We find that the 52 kDa protein is a glycoprotein and a Ca2+ binder bearing a high content of leucine, serine and glycine. By microsequencing we determined its 13 N-terminal sequence, AYL*PIDLNQLAK, with the asterisk representing an ambiguous signal. In order to study further the 52 kDa protein we have raised a polyclonal antibody against a synthetic oligopeptide representing the N-terminal 13 residues of the 52 kDa protein. By immunogold labelling with the antibody, the epitopes were localized at the EM level to the laminated corneal lens. The number of the gold particles per microns2 in the electron-dense layer of the corneal lens was 2.5 times higher than that of the electron-lucent layer. The pattern of the 52 kDa protein distribution in the corneal lens suggests that the 52 kDa protein is the major protein component that participates in the pattern formation of the alternate refractive indices of the D. melanogaster corneal lens. An X-ray dispersion analysis in situ revealed that the laminated corneal lens contained a higher concentration of Ca2+, supporting the hypothesis that the 52 kDa protein binds Ca2+ in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that identifies the protein entity of an arthropod corneal lens. We propose to designate this 52 kDa protein drosocrystallin.",1992,"N Komori, J Usukura, H Matsumoto, N Komori, J Usukura, H Matsumoto"
"Patterns of naturally occurring restriction map variation, dopa decarboxylase activity variation and linkage disequilibrium in the Ddc gene region of Drosophila melanogaster",1358752,,"Forty-six second-chromosome lines of Drosophila melanogaster isolated from five natural populations were surveyed for restriction map variation in a 65-kb region surrounding the gene (Ddc) encoding dopa decarboxylase (DDC). Sixty-nine restriction sites were scored, 13 of which were polymorphic. Average heterozygosity per nucleotide was estimated to be 0.005. Eight large (0.7-5.0 kb) inserts, two small inserts (100 and 200 bp) and three small deletions (100-300 bp) were also observed across the 65-kb region. We see no evidence for a reduction in either nucleotide heterozygosity or insertion/deletion variation in the central 26-kb segment containing Ddc and a dense cluster of lethal complementation groups and transcripts (greater than or equal to 9 genes) compared to that seen in the adjacent regions (totaling 39 kb) in which only a single gene and transcript has been detected, or to that observed for other gene regions in D. melanogaster. The distribution of restriction site variation shows no significant departure from that expected under an equilibrium neutral model. However insertions and deletions show a significant departure from neutrality in that they are too rare in frequency, consistent with them being deleterious on average. Significant linkage disequilibrium among variants exists across much of the 65-kb region. Lower regional rates of recombination combined with the influence of polymorphic chromosomal inversions, rather than epistatic selection among genes in the dense cluster, probably are sufficient explanations for the creation and/or maintenance of the linkage disequilibrium observed in the Ddc region. We have also assayed adult DDC enzyme activity in these same lines. Twofold variation in activity among lines is observed within our sample. Significant associations are observed between level of DDC enzyme activity and restriction map variants. Surprisingly, one line with a 5.0-kb insert within an intron and one line with a 1.5-kb insert near the 5' end of Ddc each show normal adult DDC activities.",1992,"C F Aquadro, R M Jennings Jr, M M Bland, C C Laurie, C H Langley, C F Aquadro, R M Jennings Jr, M M Bland, C C Laurie, C H Langley"
Distribution of DNA polymerase alpha during nuclear division cycles in Drosophila melanogaster embryo,1606620,10.1247/csf.17.105,"An immunocytochemical method using a specific monoclonal antibody was employed to detect DNA polymerase alpha in Drosophila melanogaster embryos during the first 13 nuclear division cycles after fertilization. The anti-DNA polymerase alpha antibody stained the ooplasm of the unfertilized egg, indicating that DNA polymerase alpha is maternally stored. Strong nuclear staining with the antibody over the weaker staining of the cytoplasm was observed at interphase throughout the 13 nuclear division cycles. The staining of the cytoplasmic regions surrounding the nucleus was much stronger than the other region of the syncytial cytoplasm until cycle 10. Although prophase nuclei were stained with the antibody, metaphase chromosomes were never stained throughout the 13 cycles. The chromosomal (nuclear) staining reappeared at anaphase until cycle 11 and at telophase in later cycles. The staining of the syncytial cytoplasm except for the cortical region became faint by cycle 13, suggesting the consumption of the maternal storage by this cycle. These results suggest that DNA polymerase alpha dissociates from chromosomes at the beginning of metaphase; then in later mitotic phases, it is transported from the syncytial cytoplasm into nuclei to participate in formation of the active DNA replication enzyme complex.",1992,"M Yamaguchi, K Kuroda, F Hirose, A Matsukage, M Yamaguchi, K Kuroda, F Hirose, A Matsukage"
Expression of recombinant cytochromes c from various species in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: post-translational modifications,1336689,10.1016/1046-5928(92)90061-z,"A complete protocol for the expression of recombinant cytochrome c genes from yeast, Drosophila melanogaster, and rat in a yeast strain, GM-3C-2, which does not express its own cytochromes c is described. The construction of the expression vectors, transformation and large-scale growth of the yeast, and preparation and purification of the recombinant cytochromes c are described. It was found that, contrary to the way yeast modifies its own cytochromes c, the recombinant proteins were partially acetylated at their N-terminus, except for the drosophila protein, which remained entirely unblocked. Furthermore, the yeast and rat proteins were close to fully trimethylated at lysine 72, while the drosophila protein could be separated chromatographically into forms containing tri-, di-, mono-, and unmethylated lysine 72 showing corresponding resonances in the NMR spectrum. These observations emphasize that, in employing expression procedures to obtain native or mutant forms of cytochrome c, it is essential to identify the variety and extent of post-translational modifications and to separate the preparation into pure monomolecular species. Otherwise, it may become impossible to distinguish between the influence of a site-directed mutation and unexamined post-translational modifications.",1992,"T I Koshy, T L Luntz, E A Garber, E Margoliash, T I Koshy, T L Luntz, E A Garber, E Margoliash"
The RNA polymerase II 15-kilodalton subunit is essential for viability in Drosophila melanogaster,1545824,10.1128/mcb.12.3.928,"A small, divergently transcribed gene is located 500 bp upstream of the suppressor of Hairy-wing locus of Drosophila melanogaster. Sequencing of a full-length cDNA clone of the predominant 850-nucleotide transcript reveals that this gene encodes a 15,100-Da protein with high homology to a subunit of RNA polymerase II. The RpII15 protein is 46% identical to the RPB9 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one of the smallest subunits of RNA polymerase II from that species. Among those identical residues are four pairs of cysteines whose spacing is suggestive of two metal-binding ""finger"" domains. The gene is expressed at all developmental stages and in all tissues. Two deletions within the RpII15 gene are multiphasic lethal deletions, with accumulation of dead animals commencing at the second larval instar. Ovary transplantation experiments indicate that survival of mutant animals to this stage is due to the persistence of maternal gene product throughout embryogenesis and early larval development. The RpII15 gene product is thus necessary for viability of D. melanogaster.",1992,"D A Harrison, M A Mortin, V G Corces, D A Harrison, M A Mortin, V G Corces"
DNA position-specific repression of transcription by a Drosophila zinc finger protein,1327958,10.1101/gad.6.10.1865,"Expression of the yellow (y) gene of Drosophila melanogaster is controlled by a series of tissue-specific transcriptional enhancers located in the 5' region and intron of the gene. Insertion of the gypsy retrotransposon in the y2 allele at -700 bp from the start of transcription results in a spatially restricted phenotype: Mutant tissues are those in which yellow expression is controlled by enhancers located upstream from the insertion site, but all other structures whose enhancers are downstream of the insertion site are normally pigmented. This observation can be reproduced by inserting just a 430-bp fragment containing the suppressor of Hairy-wing [su(Hw)]-binding region of gypsy into the same position where this element is inserted in y2, suggesting that the su(Hw)-binding region is sufficient to confer the mutant phenotype. Insertion of this sequence into various positions in the y gene gives rise to phenotypes that can be rationalized assuming that the presence of the su(Hw) protein inhibits the action of those tissue-specific enhancers that are located more distally from the su(Hw)-binding region with respect to the promoter.

Insect systems for the study of programmed neuronal death,1499682,10.1016/0531-5565(92)90026-v,"In the moth Manduca sexta and the fly Drosophila melanogaster, the emergence of the adult is followed by a period of neuronal death. The steroid hormones, the ecdysteroids, are involved in two aspects of this death. Ecdysteroid action early in metamorphosis is somehow essential for fixing the fates of the neurons that will die. The actual triggering of their death, however, occurs a few weeks later and requires the withdrawal of the steroid and, at least in some cases, a trans-synaptic signal. These ""execution"" events involve both RNA and protein synthesis and result in the onset of degeneration about 10 h later. The early ""decision"" of a neuron to opt for the degeneration fate is associated with an altered pattern of ecdysteroid receptor expression. A model is presented to relate how the levels of steroid receptors may be related to the activation of death-related genes.",1992,"J W Truman, J W Truman"

At the adult stage the expression of Gld becomes largely restricted to the reproductive tract of males and females. We examined the expression of GLD in the adult reproductive tract of 50 species in the genus Drosophila, as well as in those of a few representative species from four other closely related genera. GLD exhibits considerable organ-specific diversity in the reproductive tract of males and females. Among these species, five male GLD phenotypes and six female GLD phenotypes were found. In contrast, the preadult expression of GLD in representative species from each distinct adult pattern type was determined and found to be highly conserved in both the immature reproductive tract and non-reproductive organs. Moreover, the set of reproductive organs that express GLD during preadult development is equivalent to the sum of the five male and six female adult GLD phenotypes. To initially define the contribution of cis- versus trans-acting factors responsible for differences in adult GLD expression between two of these species--D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura--we transferred the D. pseudoobscura Gld to the genome of D. melanogaster and investigated its expression.

An evolutionary model for the duplication and divergence of esterase genes in Drosophila,1593643,10.1007/BF00160464,"The esterase 5 (Est-5 = gene, EST 5 = protein) enzyme in Drosophila pseudoobscura is encoded by one of three paralogous genes, Est-5A, Est-5B, and Est-5C, that are tightly clustered on the right arm of the X chromosome. The homologous Est-6 locus in Drosophila melanogaster has only one paralogous neighbor, Est-P. Comparisons of coding and flanking DNA sequences among the three D. pseudoobscura and two D. melanogaster genes suggest that two paralogous genes were present before the divergence of D. pseudoobscura from D. melanogaster and that, later, a second duplication occurred in D. pseudoobscura. Nucleotide sequences of the coding regions of the three D. pseudoobscura genes showed 78-85% similarity in pairwise comparisons, whereas the relatedness between Est-6 and Est-P was only 67%. The higher degree of conservation in D. pseudoobscura likely results from the comparatively recent divergence of Est-5B and Est-5C and from possible gene conversion events between Est-5A and Est-5B. Analyses of silent and replacement site differences in the two exons of the paralogous and orthologous genes in each species indicate that common selective forces are acting on all five loci. Further evidence for common purifying selective constraints comes from the conservation of hydropathy profiles and proposed catalytic residues. However, different levels of amino acid substitution between the paralogous genes in D. melanogaster relative to those in D. pseudoobscura suggest that interspecific differences in selection also exist.",1992,"J P Brady, R C Richmond, J P Brady, R C Richmond"

One mutation maps within the HLH domain, consistent with h function requiring homodimerization or heterodimerization with other HLH proteins. A second mutation lies in the basic domain, suggesting that DNA binding is required for h activity. Several mutations show that the h C terminus, in particular the WRPW domain, is also required for h activity, perhaps by interacting with other proteins to mediate transcriptional repression.

Evidence for intrinsic differences in the formation of chromatin domains in Drosophila melanogaster,1459427,,"The results of an investigation into intrinsic differences in the formation of two different heterochromatic domains are presented. The study utilized two different position effect variegation mutants in Drosophila melanogaster for investigating the process of compacting different stretches of DNA into heterochromatin. Each stretch of DNA encodes for a gene that affects different aspects of bristle morphology. The expression of each gene is prevented when it is compacted into heterochromatin thus the genes serve as effective reporter systems to monitor the spread of heterochromatin. Both variegating mutants are scored in the same cell such that environmental and genetic background differences are unambiguously eliminated. Any differences observed in the repression of the two genes must therefore be the result of intrinsic differences in the heterochromatic compaction process for the two stretches of DNA. Studies of the effects different enhancers of variegation have upon the compaction of the two genes indicate each compaction event occurs independently of the other, and that different components are involved in the two processes. These results are discussed with regard to spreading heterochromatin and the role this process may play in regulating gene expression.",1992,"C P Bishop, C P Bishop"
Effects of a mutation in the Drosophila porin gene encoding mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel protein on phototransduction,17525991,10.1002/dneu.20526,"Mitochondrial porins, also know as VDACs (voltage-dependent anion channels), play an important role in regulating energy metabolism, apoptosis, and the transport of metabolites across the mitochondrial outer membrane.

The mutant, however, produces <10% of the normal level of wild-type (WT) porin transcripts and 16.5% of WT level of the PORIN protein. The P-element insertion affects only the expression of Class I transcript but not Class II transcript of the porin gene. Unlike in WT, the mutant displays an ERG (electroretinogram) that is not maintained during a prolonged light stimulus.

CTCF-dependent chromatin boundary element between the latency-associated transcript and ICP0 promoters in the herpes simplex virus type 1 genome,17267480,10.1128/JVI.02447-06,"Cells latently infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV) contain nucleosomal DNA similar to that of host cell chromatin. Recent studies have demonstrated that histones in the latency-associated transcript (LAT) promoter and intron regions contain histone modifications permissive for transcription. However, those histones associated with the lytic-specific ICP0 gene, which lies only 5 kb away, contain modifications typical of silenced chromatin. How this active chromatin is kept separate from the repressed chromatin in the nearby ICP0 region remains crucial to the understanding of the HSV lytic cycle. In this study, we show that the LAT intron region contains an insulator. Specifically, we show that an 800-bp region from the LAT intron can block enhancers in both tissue culture cells and Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Importantly, the 800-bp HSV insulator protects a LAT transgene from positional effects in Drosophila eye tissue. The 800-bp region contains nine copies of 16-bp repeats. In vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that CTCF interacts with the CTCCC sequence within the repeats. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that CTCF interacts with these repeats in latently infected trigeminal ganglion neurons. The deletion of these repeats impaired insulator activity in human K562 cells and Drosophila embryos. Finally, double-spaced RNA knockdown of CTCF disrupts enhancer-blocking activity of the LAT insulator in transfected Drosophila S3 cells. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the 800-bp DNA in the LAT intron region works as a chromatin boundary during latency to separate active chromatin associated with the LAT promoter region from repressed chromatin in the ICP0 gene.",2007,"Qi Chen, Lan Lin, Sheryl Smith, Jing Huang, Shelley L Berger, Jumin Zhou, Qi Chen, Lan Lin, Sheryl Smith, Jing Huang, Shelley L Berger, Jumin Zhou"
The role of larval fat cells in adult Drosophila melanogaster,17337708,10.1242/jeb.001586,"In the life history of holometabolous insects, distinct developmental stages are tightly linked to feeding and non-feeding periods. The larval stage is characterized by extensive feeding, which supports the rapid growth of the animal and allows accumulation of energy stores, primarily in the larval fat body. In Drosophila melanogaster access to these stores during pupal development is possible because the larval fat body is preserved in the pupa as individual fat cells. These larval fat cells are refractive to autophagic cell death that removes most of the larval cells during metamorphosis. The larval fat cells are thought to persist into the adult stage and thus might also have a nutritional role in the young adult. We used cell markers to demonstrate that the fat cells in the young adult are in fact dissociated larval fat body cells, and we present evidence that these cells are eventually removed in the adult by a caspase cascade that leads to cell death. By genetically manipulating the lifespan of the larval fat cells, we demonstrate that these cells are nutritionally important during the early, non-feeding stage of adulthood. We experimentally blocked cell death of larval fat cells using the GAL4/UAS system and found that in newly eclosed adults starvation resistance increased from 58 h to 72 h. Starvation survival was highly correlated with the number of remaining larval fat cells. We discuss the implications of these results in terms of the overall nutritional status of the larva as an important factor in adult survival in environmental stresses such as starvation.",2007,"Jerell R Aguila, Justin Suszko, Allen G Gibbs, Deborah K Hoshizaki, Jerell R Aguila, Justin Suszko, Allen G Gibbs, Deborah K Hoshizaki"

Canalization of segmentation and its evolution in Drosophila,17569783,10.1073/pnas.0701359104,"Segmentation in Drosophila embryogenesis occurs through a hierarchical cascade of regulatory gene expression driven by the establishment of a diffusion-mediated morphogen gradient. Here, we investigate the response of this pattern formation process to genetic variation and evolution in egg size. Specifically, we ask whether spatial localization of gap genes Kruppel (Kr) and giant (gt) and the pair-rule gene even-skipped (eve) during cellularization is robust to genetic variation in embryo length in three Drosophila melanogaster isolines and two closely related species. We identified two wild-derived strains of D. melanogaster whose eggs differ by approximately 25% in length when reared under identical conditions. These two lines, a D. melanogaster laboratory stock (w1118), and offspring from crosses between the lines all exhibit precise scaling in the placement of gap and pair-rule gene expression along the anterior-posterior axis in relation to embryo length. Genetic analysis indicates that this scaling is maternally controlled. Maternal regulation of scaling must be required for consistent localization of segmentation gene expression because embryo size, a genetically variable and adaptive trait, is maternally inherited. We also investigated spatial scaling between these D. melanogaster lines and single lines of Drosophila sechellia and Drosophila simulans, the latter two differing by approximately 25% in egg length.

A reappraisal of Bateman's classic study of intrasexual selection,17725639,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00212.x,"Bateman's (1948) study showing greater variances in number of mates and reproductive success in male than female Drosophila melanogaster is a foundational paper in sexual selection. Here we show for the first time that his methods had flaws, including the elimination of genetic variance, sampling biases, miscalculations of fitness variances, statistical pseudo-replication, and selective presentation of data. We conclude that Bateman's results are unreliable, his conclusions are questionable, and his observed variances are similar to those expected under random mating. Despite our analysis, we do not intend this article as a criticism of Bateman; he accomplished his work without modern computational tools, and his approach was groundbreaking emphasizing the significance of fitness variance for sexual selection. However, this reanalysis has implications for what counts as evidence for sexual selection and we believe that our concerns should be of interest to contemporary students of sexual selection. We call for repetitions of Bateman's study using modern statistical and molecular methods.",2007,"Brian F Snyder, Patricia Adair Gowaty, Brian F Snyder, Patricia Adair Gowaty"
Sustained post-mating response in Drosophila melanogaster requires multiple seminal fluid proteins,18085830,10.1371/journal.pgen.0030238,"Successful reproduction is critical to pass genes to the next generation. Seminal proteins contribute to important reproductive processes that lead to fertilization in species ranging from insects to mammals. In Drosophila, the male's accessory gland is a source of seminal fluid proteins that affect the reproductive output of males and females by altering female post-mating behavior and physiology. Protein classes found in the seminal fluid of Drosophila are similar to those of other organisms, including mammals. By using RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down levels of individual accessory gland proteins (Acps), we investigated the role of 25 Acps in mediating three post-mating female responses: egg production, receptivity to remating and storage of sperm. We detected roles for five Acps in these post-mating responses. CG33943 is required for full stimulation of egg production on the first day after mating. Four other Acps (CG1652, CG1656, CG17575, and CG9997) appear to modulate the long-term response, which is the maintenance of post-mating behavior and physiological changes. The long-term post-mating response requires presence of sperm in storage and, until now, had been known to require only a single Acp. Here, we discovered several novel Acps together are required which together are required for sustained egg production, reduction in receptivity to remating of the mated female and for promotion of stored sperm release from the seminal receptacle. Our results also show that members of conserved protein classes found in seminal plasma from insects to mammals are essential for important reproductive processes.",2007,"K Ravi Ram, Mariana F Wolfner, K Ravi Ram, Mariana F Wolfner"

Mitochondrial expression of the Drosophila melanogaster multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase,17855655,10.1124/mol.107.037051,"The multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase from Drosophila melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase (Dm-dNK) is studied as a candidate suicide gene for applications in combined gene/chemotherapy of cancer. We have created an engineered Dm-dNK nucleoside kinase that is targeted to the mitochondrial matrix. The enzyme was expressed in a thymidine kinase 1-deficient osteosarcoma cell line, and the sensitivity of the cells to cytotoxic nucleoside analogs was determined when the enzyme was targeted to either the nucleus or the mitochondrial matrix. Although the total deoxythymidine (dThd) phosphorylation activity was similar in cells expressing Dm-dNK in the nucleus or in the mitochondria, the cells expressing the enzyme in the mitochondria showed higher sensitivity to the antiproliferative activity of several pyrimidine nucleoside analogs, such as (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine. Labeling studies using [3H]dThd showed that the cells expressing the mitochondrial enzyme had an increased incorporation of [3H]dThd into DNA, shown to be due to a higher [3H]dTTP specific activity of the total dTTP pool in the cells in which Dm-dNK was targeted to the mitochondria. The difference in the specific activity of the dTTP pool is a result of different contributions of the de novo and the salvage pathways for the dTTP synthesis in transduced cells. In summary, these findings suggest that mitochondrial targeting of Dm-dNK facilitates nucleoside and nucleoside analog phosphorylation and could be used as a strategy to enhance the efficacy of nucleoside analog phosphorylation and concomitantly their cytostatic potential.",2007,"Nicola Solaroli, Xinyu Zheng, Magnus Johansson, Jan Balzarini, Anna Karlsson, Nicola Solaroli, Xinyu Zheng, Magnus Johansson, Jan Balzarini, Anna Karlsson"
Molecular analysis of core kinetochore composition and assembly in Drosophila melanogaster,17534428,10.1371/journal.pone.0000478,"Background:
      
    

    
      Kinetochores are large multiprotein complexes indispensable for proper chromosome segregation. Although Drosophila is a classical model organism for studies of chromosome segregation, little is known about the organization of its kinetochores.
    

    
  


        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      We employed bioinformatics, proteomics and cell biology methods to identify and analyze the interaction network of Drosophila kinetochore proteins. We have shown that three Drosophila proteins highly diverged from human and yeast Ndc80, Nuf2 and Mis12 are indeed their orthologues. Affinity purification of these proteins from cultured Drosophila cells identified a further five interacting proteins with weak similarity to subunits of the SPC105/KNL-1, MIND/MIS12 and NDC80 kinetochore complexes together with known kinetochore associated proteins such as dynein/dynactin, spindle assembly checkpoint components and heterochromatin proteins. All eight kinetochore complex proteins were present at the kinetochore during mitosis and MIND/MIS12 complex proteins were also centromeric during interphase. Their down-regulation led to dramatic defects in chromosome congression/segregation frequently accompanied by mitotic spindle elongation. The systematic depletion of each individual protein allowed us to establish dependency relationships for their recruitment onto the kinetochore. This revealed the sequential recruitment of individual members of first, the MIND/MIS12 and then, NDC80 complex.
    

    
  


        Conclusions/significance:
      
    

    
      The Drosophila MIND/MIS12 and NDC80 complexes and the Spc105 protein, like their counterparts from other eukaryotic species, are essential for chromosome congression and segregation, but are highly diverged in sequence. Hierarchical dependence relationships of individual proteins regulate the assembly of Drosophila kinetochore complexes in a manner similar, but not identical, to other organisms.",2007,"Marcin R Przewloka, Wei Zhang, Patricia Costa, Vincent Archambault, Pier Paolo D'Avino, Kathryn S Lilley, Ernest D Laue, Andrew D McAinsh, David M Glover, Marcin R Przewloka, Wei Zhang, Patricia Costa, Vincent Archambault, Pier Paolo D'Avino, Kathryn S Lilley, Ernest D Laue, Andrew D McAinsh, David M Glover"
Lifespan modification by glucose and methionine in Drosophila melanogaster fed a chemically defined diet,19424828,10.1007/s11357-006-9018-4,"Experimentally restricting dietary calories, while maintaining adequate dietary nutrient content, extends lifespan in phylogenetically diverse species; thus suggesting the existence of conserved pathways which can modify lifespan in response to energy intake. However, in some cases the impact on longevity may depend on the quality of the energy source. In Drosophila, restriction of dietary yeast yields considerable lifespan extension whereas isocaloric restriction of dietary sugar yields only modest extension, indicating that other diet-responsive pathways can modify lifespan in this species. In rodents, restricting intake of a single amino acid - methionine - extends lifespan. Here we show that dietary methionine can modify lifespan in adult female, non-virgin Oregon-R strain Drosophila fed a chemically defined media. Compared to a diet containing 0.135% methionine and 15% glucose, high dietary methionine (0.405%) shortened maximum lifespan by 2.33% from 86 to 84 days and mean lifespan by 9.55% from 71.7 to 64.9 days. Further restriction of methionine to 0.045% did not extend maximum lifespan and shortened mean lifespan by 1.95% from 71.1 to 70.3 days. Restricting glucose from 15% to 5% while holding methionine at a concentration of 0.135%, modestly extended maximum lifespan by 5.8% from 86 to 91 days, without extending mean lifespan. All these diet-induced changes were highly significant (log-rank p < 0.0001). Notably, all four diets resulted in considerably longer life spans than those typically reported for flies fed conventional yeast and sugar based diets. Such defined diets can be used to identify lifespan-modifying pathways and specific gene-nutrient interactions in Drosophila.",2007,"Aron M Troen, Emily E French, Jessica F Roberts, Jacob Selhub, Jose M Ordovas, Laurence D Parnell, Chao-Qiang Lai, Aron M Troen, Emily E French, Jessica F Roberts, Jacob Selhub, Jose M Ordovas, Laurence D Parnell, Chao-Qiang Lai"

Intracellular targeting of telomeric retrotransposon Gag proteins of distantly related Drosophila species,17483480,10.1073/pnas.0702566104,"The retrotransposons that maintain telomeres in Drosophila melanogaster have unique features that are shared across all Drosophila species but are not found in other retrotransposons. Comparative analysis of these features provides insight into their importance for telomere maintenance in Drosophila. Gag proteins encoded by HeT-A(mel) and TART(mel) are efficiently and cooperatively targeted to telomeres in interphase nuclei, a behavior that may facilitate telomere-specific transposition. Drosophila virilis, separated from D. melanogaster by 60 MY, has telomeres maintained by HeT-A(vir) and TART(vir). The Gag proteins from HeT-A(mel) and HeT-A(vir) have only 16% amino acid identity, yet several of their functional features are conserved. Using transient transfection of cultured cells from both species, we show that the telomere association of HeT-A(vir) Gag is indistinguishable from that of HeT-A(mel) Gag. Deletion derivatives show that organization of localization signals within the two proteins is strikingly similar. Gag proteins of TART(mel) and TART(vir) are only 13% identical. In contrast to HeT-A, surprisingly, TART(vir) Gag does not localize to the nucleus, although TART(vir) is a major component of D. virilis telomeres, and localization signals in the protein have much the same organization as in TART(mel) Gag. Thus, the mechanism of telomere targeting of TART(vir) differs, at least in a minor way, from that of TART(mel). Our findings suggest that, despite dramatic rates of protein evolution, protein and cellular determinants that correctly localize these Gag proteins have been conserved throughout the 60 MY separating these species.",2007,"Elena Casacuberta, Fernando AzorÃ­n MarÃ­n, Mary-Lou Pardue, Elena Casacuberta, Fernando AzorÃ­n MarÃ­n, Mary-Lou Pardue"
Knockdown resistance to heat stress and slow recovery from chill coma are genetically associated in a quantitative trait locus region of chromosome 2 in Drosophila melanogaster,17651203,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03335.x,"In insects, two ecologically relevant traits of thermal adaptation are knockdown resistance to high temperature (KRHT) and chill-coma recovery (CCR). Chromosome 2 of Drosophila melanogaster was tested for quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting both CCR and KRHT in backcrosses between homosequential lines that are fixed for the standard (noninverted) sequence of this autosome. These lines were obtained by artificial selection on KRHT and subsequent inbreeding from a stock that was derived from a single wild population. Heat-induced expression of the 70KD heat-shock protein (Hsp70) was also examined for variation between the lines. Composite interval mapping was performed for each trait on each reciprocal backcross, identifying one QTL region in the middle of chromosome 2 for both KRHT and CCR. The largest estimates of additive effects were found in pericentromeric regions of chromosome 2, accounting for 10-14% (CCR) and 10-17% (KRHT) of the phenotypic variance in BC populations. No QTL was found in the region of the heat-shock factor (hsf) gene. However, the two parental lines have diverged in the heat-induced Hsp70 expression. Distribution of KRHT QTL on chromosome 2 was similar between this study based on crosses between lines selected from a single wild population and previous work based on crosses between selection lines from different continents. Colocalized QTL showed a trade-off association between CCR and KRHT, which should be the result of either multiple, tightly linked trait-specific genes or a single gene with pleiotropic effects on the traits. We discuss candidate loci contained within the QTL regions.",2007,"Fabian M Norry, Federico H Gomez, Volker Loeschcke, Fabian M Norry, Federico H Gomez, Volker Loeschcke"

A hot spot for the transposition was discovered in the promoter regions of genes hsp70Aa and hsp70Ab. No insertions of this construction in the coding or 3'-flanking regions of hsp70 genes have been recorded.

Genetic approaches to studying adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing,17662845,10.1016/S0076-6879(07)24012-1,"Increasing proteomic diversity via the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) in select mRNA templates appears crucial to the correct functioning of the nervous system in several model organisms, including Drosophila, Caenorabditis elegans, and mice. The genome of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, contains a single gene encoding the enzyme responsible for deamination, termed ADAR (for adenosine deaminase acting on RNA). The mRNAs that form the substrates for ADAR primarily function in neuronal signaling, and, correspondingly, deletion of ADAR leads to severe nervous system defects. While several ADAR enzymes are present in mice, the presence of a single ADAR in Drosophila, combined with the diverse genetic toolkit available to researchers and the wide range of ADAR target mRNAs identified to date, make Drosophila an ideal organism to study the genetic basis of A-to-I RNA editing. This chapter describes a variety of methods for genetically manipulating Drosophila A-to-I editing both in time and space, as well as techniques to study the molecular basis of ADAR-mRNA interactions. A prerequisite for experiments in this field is the ability to quantify the levels of editing in a given mRNA.

First, epithelia, such as those beneath the cuticle, in the alimentary tract, and in tracheae, act both as a physical barrier and local defense against pathogens by producing antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species. Second, specialized hemocytes participate in phagocytosis and encapsulation of foreign intruders in the hemolymph. Finally, the fat body, a functional equivalent of the mammalian liver, produces humoral response molecules including antimicrobial peptides.

Telomeric trans-silencing: an epigenetic repression combining RNA silencing and heterochromatin formation,17941712,10.1371/journal.pgen.0030158,"The study of P-element repression in Drosophila melanogaster led to the discovery of the telomeric Trans-Silencing Effect (TSE), a repression mechanism by which a transposon or a transgene inserted in subtelomeric heterochromatin (Telomeric Associated Sequence or TAS) has the capacity to repress in trans in the female germline, a homologous transposon, or transgene located in euchromatin. TSE shows variegation among egg chambers in ovaries when silencing is incomplete. Here, we report that TSE displays an epigenetic transmission through meiosis, which involves an extrachromosomal maternally transmitted factor. We show that this silencing is highly sensitive to mutations affecting both heterochromatin formation (Su(var)205 encoding Heterochromatin Protein 1 and Su(var)3-7) and the repeat-associated small interfering RNA (or rasiRNA) silencing pathway (aubergine, homeless, armitage, and piwi). In contrast, TSE is not sensitive to mutations affecting r2d2, which is involved in the small interfering RNA (or siRNA) silencing pathway, nor is it sensitive to a mutation in loquacious, which is involved in the micro RNA (or miRNA) silencing pathway. These results, taken together with the recent discovery of TAS homologous small RNAs associated to PIWI proteins, support the proposition that TSE involves a repeat-associated small interfering RNA pathway linked to heterochromatin formation, which was co-opted by the P element to establish repression of its own transposition after its recent invasion of the D. melanogaster genome.

The effects DLP mutations show in the loss of heterozygosity assay and on phenotypes resulting from Dmp53 overexpression indicate a genetic interaction between DLP and Dmp53. In contrast to Dmp53 mutants, however, loss of DLP does not result in radiosensitivity indicating that it does not play an essential role in the activation of Dmp53-dependent response after ionizing radiation, and DLP is also not required for the irradiation-induced activation of reaper. In contrast, DLP is involved in the transcriptional regulation of Ark, because Ark mRNA level is decreased in DLP mutants and increased upon ectopic overexpression of DLP.

Flies overexpressing NF1 had increased life spans, improved reproductive fitness, increased resistance to oxidative and heat stress in association with increased mitochondrial respiration and a 60% reduction in ROS production. These phenotypic effects proved to be modulated by the adenylyl cyclase/cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A pathway, not the Ras/Raf pathway. Treatment of wild-type D. melanogaster with cAMP analogs increased their life span, and treatment of NF1 mutants with metalloporphyrin catalytic antioxidant compounds restored their life span.

Comparative genomic analysis of the odorant-binding protein family in 12 Drosophila genomes: purifying selection and birth-and-death evolution,18039354,10.1186/gb-2007-8-11-r235,"Background:
      
    

    
      Chemoreception is a widespread mechanism that is involved in critical biologic processes, including individual and social behavior. The insect peripheral olfactory system comprises three major multigene families: the olfactory receptor (Or), the gustatory receptor (Gr), and the odorant-binding protein (OBP) families. Members of the latter family establish the first contact with the odorants, and thus constitute the first step in the chemosensory transduction pathway.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Comparative analysis of the OBP family in 12 Drosophila genomes allowed the identification of 595 genes that encode putative functional and nonfunctional members in extant species, with 43 gene gains and 28 gene losses (15 deletions and 13 pseudogenization events). The evolution of this family shows tandem gene duplication events, progressive divergence in DNA and amino acid sequence, and prevalence of pseudogenization events in external branches of the phylogenetic tree. We observed that the OBP arrangement in clusters is maintained across the Drosophila species and that purifying selection governs the evolution of the family; nevertheless, OBP genes differ in their functional constraints levels. Finally, we detect that the OBP repertoire evolves more rapidly in the specialist lineages of the Drosophila melanogaster group (D. sechellia and D. erecta) than in their closest generalists.

We also demonstrate that jointly considering spatial patterns of association among variants alongside the site-frequency spectrum is nonetheless of value. Through a comparison of models of equilibrium neutrality, nonequilibrium neutrality, equilibrium hitchhiking, nonequilibrium hitchhiking, and recurrent hitchhiking, we evaluate a linkage disequilibrium (LD) statistic (omega(max)) that appears to have power to identify regions recently shaped by positive selection.

Variable sexually dimorphic gene expression in laboratory strains of Drosophila melanogaster,18070343,10.1186/1471-2164-8-454,"Background:
      
    

    
      Wild-type laboratory strains of model organisms are typically kept in isolation for many years, with the action of genetic drift and selection on mutational variation causing lineages to diverge with time. Natural populations from which such strains are established, show that gender-specific interactions in particular drive many aspects of sequence level and transcriptional level variation. Here, our goal was to identify genes that display transcriptional variation between laboratory strains of Drosophila melanogaster, and to explore evidence of gender-biased interactions underlying that variability.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Transcriptional variation among the laboratory genotypes studied occurs more frequently in males than in females. Qualitative differences are also apparent to suggest that genes within particular functional classes disproportionately display variation in gene expression. Our analysis indicates that genes with reproductive functions are most often divergent between genotypes in both sexes, however a large proportion of female variation can also be attributed to genes without expression in the ovaries.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:

Mitch a rapidly evolving component of the Ndc80 kinetochore complex required for correct chromosome segregation in Drosophila,17895365,10.1242/jcs.012112,"We identified an essential kinetochore protein, Mitch, from a genetic screen in D. melanogaster. Mitch localizes to the kinetochore, and its targeting is independent of microtubules (MTs) and several other known kinetochore components. Animals carrying mutations in mitch die as late third-instar larvae; mitotic neuroblasts in larval brains exhibit high levels of aneuploidy. Analysis of fixed D. melanogaster brains and mitch RNAi in cultured cells, as well as video recordings of cultured mitch mutant neuroblasts, reveal that chromosome alignment in mitch mutants is compromised during spindle formation, with many chromosomes displaying persistent mono-orientation. These misalignments lead to aneuploidy during anaphase. Mutations in mitch also disrupt chromosome behavior during both meiotic divisions in spermatocytes: the entire chromosome complement often moves to only one spindle pole. Mutant mitotic cells exhibit contradictory behavior with respect to the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Anaphase onset is delayed in untreated cells, probably because incorrect kinetochore attachment maintains the SAC. However, mutant brain cells and mitch RNAi cells treated with MT poisons prematurely disjoin their chromatids, and exit mitosis. These data suggest that Mitch participates in SAC signaling that responds specifically to disruptions in spindle microtubule dynamics. The mitch gene corresponds to the transcriptional unit CG7242, and encodes a protein that is a possible ortholog of the Spc24 or Spc25 subunit of the Ndc80 kinetochore complex. Despite the crucial role of Mitch in cell division, the mitch gene has evolved very rapidly among species in the genus Drosophila.",2007,"Byron Williams, Garmay Leung, Helder Maiato, Alex Wong, Zexiao Li, Erika V Williams, Catherine Kirkpatrick, Charles F Aquadro, Conly L Rieder, Michael L Goldberg, Byron Williams, Garmay Leung, Helder Maiato, Alex Wong, Zexiao Li, Erika V Williams, Catherine Kirkpatrick, Charles F Aquadro, Conly L Rieder, Michael L Goldberg"
Evidence for recent horizontal transfer of gypsy-homologous LTR-retrotransposon gtwin into Drosophila erecta followed by its amplification with multiple aberrations,17459613,10.1016/j.gene.2007.02.019,"Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon gtwin was initially discovered in silico, and then it was isolated as gypsy-homologous sequence from Drosophila melanogaster strain, G32. The presence of ORF3 suggests, that gtwin, like gypsy, may be an endogenous retrovirus, which can leave the cell and infect another one. Therefore, in this study we decided to investigate the distribution of gtwin in different species of the melanogaster subgroup in order to find out whether gtwin can be transferred horizontally as well as vertically. Gtwin was found in all 9 species of this subgroup, hence it seems to have inhabited the host genomes for a long time. In addition, we have shown that in the Drosophila erecta genome two gtwin families are present. The first one has 93% of identity to D. melanogaster element and is likely to be a descendant of gtwin that existed in Drosophila before the divergence of the melanogaster subgroup species. The other one has >99% of identity to D. melanogaster gtwin. The most reasonable explanation is that this element has been recently horizontally transferred between D. melanogaster and D. erecta. The number and variety of gtwin copies from the ""infectious"" family suggest that after the horizontal transfer into D. erecta genome, gtwin underwent amplification and aberrations, leading to the rise of its diverse variants.",2007,"Alina P Kotnova, Ivan A Glukhov, Nina N Karpova, Veniamin B Salenko, Natalia V Lyubomirskaya, Yuriy V Ilyin"
Using experimental evolution to study the physiological mechanisms of desiccation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,17508334,10.1086/518354,"Data from populations undergoing experimental evolution can be used to make comparisons between physiologically differentiated populations and to determine evolutionary trajectories. Comparisons of long-established laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster that are strongly differentiated with respect to desiccation resistance are used to test alternative hypotheses concerning the mechanisms that fruit flies use to survive bouts of extreme desiccation. This comparative study supports the hypothesis that, in at least one case, D. melanogaster can evolve increased resistance to desiccation by decreasing water loss rates and by increasing bulk water content but not by increasing metabolic water content or dehydration tolerance. While glycogen was involved in water storage, its primary role was in water binding, not the production of metabolic water. Measurement of the trajectories of these component mechanisms during selection for desiccation resistance is used to demonstrate that water loss rate quickly plateaus in response to selection, while water content continues to improve. This disparity reveals the value of studying evolutionary trajectories and the need for longer-term selection studies in evolutionary physiology.",2007,"Margaret A Archer, Timothy J Bradley, Laurence D Mueller, Michael R Rose, Margaret A Archer, Timothy J Bradley, Laurence D Mueller, Michael R Rose"

An experimental test for indirect benefits in Drosophila melanogaster,17349042,10.1186/1471-2148-7-36,"Background:
      
    

    
      Despite much empirical attention, tests for indirect benefits of mate choice have rarely considered the major components of sexual and nonsexual offspring fitness relevant to a population. Here we use a novel experimental design to test for the existence of any indirect benefits in a laboratory adapted population of D. melanogaster. Our experiment compared the fitness (mating success, longevity, and productivity) of individuals possessing genomes that derived two generations previously from males that were either entirely successful (studs) or wholly unsuccessful (duds) at achieving mates in three subsequent rounds of mating trials.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Males from the stud treatment were 30% more successful on average at securing mates than males from the dud treatment. In contrast, we found no difference between treatments in measures of productivity or of longevity when measured in a mixed-sex environment. In the absence of females, however, males in the stud treatment outlived males in the dud treatment.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our results suggest that mating with successful males in this population provides an indirect benefit to females and that, at least in this environment, the benefit arises primarily through the production of more attractive male offspring. However, it is unclear whether this represents solely a traditional sexy sons benefit or whether there is an additional good genes component (with male offspring simply allocating their surplus condition to traits that enhance their mating success). The lack of any detectable differences in female fitness between the two treatments suggests the former, although the longevity advantage of males in the stud treatment when females were absent is consistent with the latter. Determining the effect of this indirect benefit on the evolution of female mate preferences (or resistance) will require comparable data on the direct costs of mating with various males, and an understanding of how these costs and benefits integrate across generations and vary among environments.",2007,"Howard D Rundle, Anders Odeen, Arne ?

Met homologs were isolated from three mosquito species, Culex pipiens, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae. Sequence similarity was found to be high in bHLH and PAS conserved domains, and the majority of the 7-9 introns in AaMet and AgMet are located in either identical or similar positions, indicating evolutionary relatedness. Sequence comparison with Met and the similar germ-cell expressed (gce) gene in D. melanogaster showed that the mosquito genes are more similar to gce than to Met. Moreover, the multiple introns in AgMet and AaMet are more similar in number with the 7 introns in Dmgce than to the single intron in DmMet; in fact, six intron positions in AaMet and AgMet are similar to those in Dmgce. Efforts to identify a second homologous gene in mosquitoes were unsuccessful, suggesting a single gene in lower Diptera, consistent with the single gene uncovered in genomic sequencing of Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae. These results suggest that a gene duplication occurred during the evolution of higher Diptera, resulting in Met and gce.",2007,"Shaoli Wang, Aaron Baumann, Thomas G Wilson, Shaoli Wang, Aaron Baumann, Thomas G Wilson"
A screen for neurotransmitter transporters expressed in the visual system of Drosophila melanogaster identifies three novel genes,17443808,10.1002/dneu.20342,"The fly eye provides an attractive substrate for genetic studies, and critical transport activities for synaptic transmission and pigment biogenesis in the insect visual system remain unknown. We therefore screened for transporters in Drosophila melanogaster that are down-regulated by genetically ablating the eye. Using a large panel of transporter specific probes on Northern blots, we identified three transcripts that are down-regulated in flies lacking eye tissue. Two of these, CG13794 and CG13795, are part of a previously unknown subfamily of putative solute carriers within the neurotransmitter transporter family. The third, CG4476, is a member of a related subfamily that includes characterized nutrient transporters expressed in the insect gut. Using imprecise excision of a nearby transposable P element, we have generated a series of deletions in the CG4476 gene. In fast phototaxis assays, CG4476 mutants show a decreased behavioral response to light, and the most severe mutant behaves as if it were blind. These data suggest an unforeseen role for the ""nutrient amino acid transporter"" subfamily in the nervous system, and suggest new models to study transport function using the fly eye.",2007,"Rafael Romero-CalderÃ³n, Ratula M Shome, Anne F Simon, Richard W Daniels, Aaron DiAntonio, David E Krantz, Rafael Romero-CalderÃ³n, Ratula M Shome, Anne F Simon, Richard W Daniels, Aaron DiAntonio, David E Krantz"
Cumulative contributions of weak DNA determinants to targeting the Drosophila dosage compensation complex,17483514,10.1093/nar/gkm282,"Fine-tuning of X chromosomal gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster involves the selective interaction of the Dosage Compensation Complex (DCC) with the male X chromosome, in order to increase the transcription of many genes. However, the X chromosomal DNA sequences determining DCC binding remain elusive. By adapting a 'one-hybrid' assay, we identified minimal DNA elements that direct the interaction of the key DCC subunit, MSL2, in cells. Strikingly, several such novel MSL2 recruitment modules have very different DNA sequences. The assay revealed a novel, 40 bp DNA element that is necessary for recruitment of DCC to an autosomal binding site in flies in the context of a longer sequence and sufficient by itself to direct recruitment if trimerized. Accordingly, recruitment of MSL2 to the single 40 bp element in cells was weak, but as a trimer approached the power of the strongest DCC recruitment site known to date, the roX1 DH site. This element is the shortest MSL2 recruitment sequence known to date. The results support a model for MSL2 recruitment according to which several different, degenerate sequence motifs of variable affinity cluster and synergise to form a high affinity site.",2007,"Gregor D Gilfillan, Cornelia KÃ¶nig, Ina K Dahlsveen, Nicky Prakoura, Tobias Straub, Rosemarie Lamm, Torsten Fauth, Peter B Becker, Gregor D Gilfillan, Cornelia KÃ¶nig, Ina K Dahlsveen, Nicky Prakoura, Tobias Straub, Rosemarie Lamm, Torsten Fauth, Peter B Becker"
Extension of Drosophila melanogaster life span with a GPCR peptide inhibitor,17546039,10.1038/nchembio.2007.2,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate signaling from extracellular ligands to intracellular signal transduction proteins. Methuselah (Mth) is a class B (secretin-like) GPCR, a family typified by their large, ligand-binding, N-terminal extracellular domains. Downregulation of mth increases the life span of Drosophila melanogaster; inhibitors of Mth signaling should therefore enhance longevity. We used mRNA display selection to identify high-affinity (K(d) = 15 to 30 nM) peptide ligands that bind to the N-terminal ectodomain of Mth. The selected peptides are potent antagonists of Mth signaling, and structural studies suggest that they perturb the interface between the Mth ecto- and transmembrane domains. Flies constitutively expressing a Mth antagonist peptide have a robust life span extension, which suggests that the peptides inhibit Mth signaling in vivo.

Regulation occurs at the level of individual genes, chromosomal domains, and entire chromosomes. The chromatin state is dynamic, allowing for changes in gene expression in response to cellular signals and/or environmental cues. Changes in chromatin result from the action of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes, reversible epigenetic histone modifications, and the incorporation of histone variants.

Its mRNA can be detected in the adult fly; moreover, a high level of expression occurs at 3 hr of Drosophila embryogenesis. This early embryonic expression is surprisingly organized in a seven-stripe pattern that appears at the cellular blastoderm stage. In addition, this pattern is in phase with that of the even-parasegment-expressed pair-rule gene fushi-tarazu and is similarly modified by mutations affecting segmentation genes. Simultaneously with this pair-rule expression, the complete machinery of serotonin synthesis is present and leads to a peak of ligand concomitant with a peak of 5-HT2-specific receptor sites in blastoderm embryos.",1995,"J F Colas, J M Launay, O Kellermann, P Rosay, L Maroteaux, J F Colas, J M Launay, O Kellermann, P Rosay, L Maroteaux"

Two large wild-derived populations and a long-established laboratory cage population were used as base stocks, from which subpopulations were extracted and slowly inbred under crowded conditions over a period of 210 generations. Comparisons have been made of the competitive ability and reproductive fitness of these subpopulations, the panmictic populations produced from them by hybridization and random mating and the wild- or cage-base populations from which they were derived. After an average of approximately 180 generations in the laboratory, the wild-derived panmictic populations exceeded the resampled natural populations by 75% in fitness under competitive conditions. The cage-derived panmictic population, after a total of 17 years in the laboratory, showed a 90% superiority in competitive ability over the corresponding wild population. In the inbred lines derived from the wild-base stocks, the average rate of adaptation was estimated to be 0.33 +/- 0.06% per generation. However, the gain in competitive ability was more than offset by inbreeding depression at an initial rate of approximately 2% per generation. The effects of both adaptation and inbreeding on reproductive ability in a noncompetitive environment were found to be minor by comparison. The maintenance of captive populations under noncompetitive conditions can therefore be expected to minimize adaptive changes due to natural selection in the changed environment.",1995,"B D Latter, J C Mulley, B D Latter, J C Mulley"

Fluid reabsorption and ion transport by the lower Malpighian tubules of adult female Drosophila,7636442,,"The properties of the Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster change along their length. The upstream main segments secrete K(+)-rich fluid at a high rate. From this, the lower tubules reabsorb significant amounts of water and K+. Under stimulation, K+ reabsorption is accelerated. In addition, the lower tubules acidify the fluid passed to them by the main segments and secrete Ca2+ into it, adding to that transported there by the upstream epithelium. In contrast to the lumen-positive transepithelial potential difference (TEP) of the main segments, the TEP in the lower tubules is much lower and becomes lumen-negative close to their downstream junction with the common ureter. We suggest that the role of the lower tubule is to reduce the flow of K(+)-rich fluid that passes to the hindgut; this allows the hindgut to process the flow of excretory fluid more thoroughly.",1995,"M J O'Donnell, S H Maddrell, M J O'Donnell, S H Maddrell"
Succinate dehydrogenase b mRNA of Drosophila melanogaster has a functional iron-responsive element in its 5'-untranslated region,8530520,10.1074/jbc.270.51.30781,"Iron-responsive elements (IREs) are cis-acting mRNA stem-loop structures that specifically bind cytoplasmic iron regulatory proteins (IRPs). IRP-IRE interactions mediate the coordinate post-transcriptional regulation of key proteins in iron metabolism, such as ferritin, transferrin receptor, and erythroid 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase. Depending on whether the IRE is located in the 5'- or 3'-untranslated region (UTR), binding of IRP will inhibit mRNA translation or degradation, respectively. Here we describe a new IRE in the 5'-UTR of succinate dehydrogenase subunit b (SDHb) mRNA of Drosophila melanogaster. The SDHb IRE binds in vitro to vertebrate and insect IRPs with a high affinity equal to that of human ferritin H chain IRE. Under conditions of iron deprivation, SDHb mRNA of Drosophila SL-2 cells shifts to a non-polysome-bound pool. Moreover, translation of a human growth hormone mRNA with the SDHb IRE in its 5'-UTR is iron-dependent in stably transfected L cells. We conclude that the SDHb IRE mediates translational inhibition both in insect and vertebrate cells. This constitutes the first identification of a functional IRE in insects. Furthermore, Drosophila SDHb represents the second example, after porcine mitochondrial aconitase, of an enzyme of the citric acid cycle whose mRNA possesses all necessary features for translational regulation by cellular iron levels.",1995,"S A Kohler, B R Henderson, L C KÃ¼hn, S A Kohler, B R Henderson, L C KÃ¼hn"

In contrast to other systems where a phosphorylated form of RP-A has been correlated with S phase, only the nonphosphorylated form of Drosophila RP-A is observed in early Drosophila embryos during DNA replication. Consistent with this role in DNA metabolism, DRP-A was localized to the nucleus. Subsequently at mitosis, DRP-A becomes delocalized.

The increased MAP kinase tyrosine phosphorylation is parallelled by increased MAP kinase activity. At least two MAP kinases, DmERK-A and DmERK-B, are identified whose tyrosine phosphorylation increases during heat shock. Thus MAP kinase activation is an immediate early response to heat shock, and its increased activity is maintained throughout heat shock treatment. Protracted MAP kinase activation may contribute to heat shock transcription factor phosphorylation and the numerous metabolic alterations that constitute the heat-shock response.",1995,"F Chen, M Torres, R F Duncan, F Chen, M Torres, R F Duncan"
Conditional hitchhiking of mitochondrial DNA: frequency shifts of Drosophila melanogaster mtDNA variants depend on nuclear genetic background,8582617,,"Tests were performed of the selective neutrality of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants from geographic populations of Drosophila melanogaster in Argentina (ARG) and Central Africa (CAF). The two populations were completely reproductively compatible. The two distinct mtDNA haplotypes from the two populations were competed in replicate experimental populations on three nuclear genetic backgrounds: homozygous ARG, homozygous CAF, or hybrid ARG/CAF. Mitochondrial haplotype frequencies did not change significantly on either of the two homozygous nuclear backgrounds, and there was no change after experimental perturbation of haplotype frequencies. On the hybrid background, the ARG haplotype frequency increased significantly for the first two generations in all replicate populations but then did not change in subsequent generations. After perturbation, the ARG haplotype frequency increased in only one of four replicates. There is no evidence for selective differences among mtDNA variants in homozygous nuclear contexts or for nuclear-mitochondrial coadaptation. While some ""fitness"" difference among mtDNA variants is required to account for the observed frequency shifts, it appears that in these hybrid populations, mtDNA is hitchhiking on fitness variation among hybrid segregating nuclear genes.

Vertical transmission of the retrotransposable elements R1 and R2 during the evolution of the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup,7713424,,"R1 and R2 are non-long-terminal repeat retrotransposable elements that insert into specific sequences of insect 28S ribosomal RNA genes. These elements have been extensively described in Drosophila melanogaster. To determine whether these elements have been horizontally or vertically transmitted, we characterized R1 and R2 elements from the seven other members of the melanogaster species subgroup by genomic blotting and nucleotide sequencing. Each species was found to have homogeneous families of R1 and R2 elements with the exception of erecta and orena, which have no R2 elements. The DNA sequences of multiple R1 and R2 copies from each species indicated nucleotide divergence within each species averaged only 0.48% for R1 and 0.35% for R2, well below the level of divergence among the species. Most copies of R1 and R2 (40 of 47) sequenced from the seven species were potentially functional, as indicated by the absence of premature termination codons or translational frameshifts that would destroy the open reading frame of the element. The sequence relationships of both the R1 and R2 elements from the various members of the melanogaster subgroup closely followed that of the species phylogeny, suggesting that R1 and R2 have been stably maintained by vertical transmission since the origin of this species subgroup 17-20 million years ago. The remarkable stability of R1 and R2, compared to what has been suggested for transposable elements that insert at multiple locations in these same species, may be due to their unique specificity for sites in the rRNA gene locus. Under low copy number conditions, when it is essential for any mobile element to transpose, the insertion specificities of R1 and R2 ensure uniform developmentally regulated target sites that can be occupied with little or no detrimental effect on the host.",1995,"D G Eickbush, T H Eickbush, D G Eickbush, T H Eickbush"

Along with common ""hot spot"" of lethal mutations, the derivatives for the Xz chromosomes had their own specific sites for lethal mutations. In some cases, the appearance of lethal mutations was accompanied by the formation of inversions in the Xz chromosome. The lethal destabilization of the Xz derivatives, caused by selection for accumulation of visible mutations, is associated with an increase in the number of hot spots for lethal mutations.

As D. simulans does not occur in India, this cline does not reflect an evolutionary interaction between the two sibling species.",1995,"A Das, S Mohanty, P Capy, J R David"
Changes in gene expression during post-eclosional development in the olfactory system of Drosophila melanogaster,8541207,10.1016/0925-4773(95)00398-k,"We have found that the expression of some genes in Drosophila melanogaster changes during the life of the adult fly. These changes can be illustrated by the use of enhancer trap lines which mark the expression of particular genes in the adult fly. Although the fly is considered able to perform most necessary adult functions within the first 72 h after eclosion from the pupal case, we find changes in expression over the first 10 days of life in the antennae of several of the genes we have examined. Some genes change by increasing from an initially low level of expression of the marked gene, while other lines, which we have termed 'late-onset' genes, show no expression of the marked gene until 4-5 days following eclosion. In contrast, some genes decrease their expression during the first 10 days of life. The changes in gene expression seen over the first 10 days of the fly's adult life provides molecular evidence of the many maturational changes occurring during the early life of the adult fly.",1995,"K J Blake, B Rogina, A Centurion, S L Helfand, K J Blake, B Rogina, A Centurion, S L Helfand"
Genotoxic effect of griseofulvin in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,7623877,10.1016/0165-1218(95)90018-7,"Griseofulvin (GF), a carcinogenic spindle poison, was tested in two types of somatic-cell assays of Drosophila melanogaster, one of which detects the induction of DNA damage and the other mutation/mitotic recombination. In both assays, GF was fed to tester larvae and genetic endpoints examined after emergence. In the wing spot test, trans-heterozygous flies carrying mwh and flr3 wing-hair mutations produced both significant and dose-dependent increases in the frequency of mwh single spots over the control level but no increase of twin spots. In the DNA repair test, double-mutant larvae carrying both mei-9(a) (excision repair-defective) and mei-41(D5) (postreplication repair-defective) mutations showed hypersensitivity to killing by GF compared with their DNA repair-proficient counterparts, suggesting that GF caused potentially lethal DNA damages which were efficiently repaired by the DNA repair-proficient but not -defective larvae. These lines of evidence clearly demonstrate that GF is genotoxic in somatic cells of Drosophila. It is noted that (1) GF-fed larvae showed a developmental delay and (2) surviving adult flies had morphological abnormalities in their eyes and wings.",1995,"H Inoue, H Baba, K Awano, K Yoshikawa, H Inoue, H Baba, K Awano, K Yoshikawa"
Characterization of an EcR/USP heterodimer target site that mediates ecdysone responsiveness of the Drosophila Lsp-2 gene,8544820,10.1007/BF00290580,"The Larval serum protein-2 gene (Lsp-2) of Drosophila melanogaster is uniquely expressed in the fat body tissue from the beginning of the third instar to the end of adult life. Accumulation of the larval Lsp-2 transcript is enhanced by 20-hydroxyecdysone. To study the molecular basis for ecdysone regulated Lsp-2 activity, deletion mutants of the Lsp-2 5'-flanking region were constructed by fusion to either the Escherichia coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene or to an hsp70-lacZ hybrid gene encoding beta-galactosidase. Constructs transfected into Drosophila S2/M3 cells were shown to confer transient ecdysone inducibility on the reporter genes. A single functional ecdysone response element (EcRE) was localized at position -75 relative to the Lsp-2 transcription initiation site. In gel mobility shift assays using fat body nuclear extracts or nuclear receptors synthesized in vitro, a 27-bp sequence harboring the EcRE bound both the Drosophila ecdysone receptor and the Drosophila retinoid-X homologue, Ultraspiracle, in a cooperative manner. Competition experiments indicate that the affinity of the Lsp-2 EcRE for the ecdysone receptor complex is comparable to that of the canonical EcRE of the hsp27 gene and is at least 4-fold greater than that of Fbp1, another fat body-specific Drosophila gene. Our results suggest that structural features of this EcRE determine its ability to induce ecdysone responsiveness at a lower ligand concentration and may form the basis for differential hormone responsiveness within the fat body.",1995,"C Antoniewski, M S O'Grady, R G Edmondson, S M Lassieur, H Benes, C Antoniewski, M S O'Grady, R G Edmondson, S M Lassieur, H Benes"

A POU homeo domain protein related to dPOU-19/pdm-1 binds to the regulatory DNA necessary for vital expression of the Drosophila choline acetyltransferase gene,7751926,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.15-05-03509.1995,"Expression of the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) gene in Drosophila melanogaster is responsible for production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and is necessary for viability. In previous studies, we have shown that the regulatory region for normal ChAT expression is large and composed of multiple regulatory elements (Kitamoto et al., 1992; Kitamoto and Salvaterra, 1993). In this study, using various lengths of 5' flanking DNA fused to wild type ChAT cDNA, we have defined a 0.3 kilobase (kb) region of the cis-regulatory DNA, which is essential for restoring viability of Cha lethal mutants. DNase I footprinting analysis of this 0.3 kb DNA revealed a protected 22 bp sequence that contains an octamer-like motif (ATTCAAAT) with one base difference from the consensus octamer motif (ATGCAAAT). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Southwestern blot analysis confirmed the presence of specific binding factor(s) for the 22 bp sequence in embryo nuclear extracts, and competition studies established the importance of the octamer-like motif for high-affinity binding. Using the 22-mer as a probe, we have isolated a cDNA clone encoding the Drosophila POU homeo domain protein, dPOU-19/pdm-1, whose target genes and specific binding sequences have not been identified.

The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that its basic structure is similar to the GABA receptor of Rdl type subunits of Drosophila melanogaster and of Blattella germanica. Particularly conserved are M1, M2 and M3 segments. Within this 146 amino acid stretch, the GABA receptor from the red flour beetle differed from corresponding ones from Drosophila and Rdl subunit of B. germanica by 12 and eight amino acids, respectively. By using an identical approach, the corresponding DNA region was sequenced from the cDNA of a cyclodiene-resistant strain of T. castaneum. While two points of mutation were found only one mutation in DNA was found to result in an amino acid shift. The site of mutation was at the 5th amino acid of the M2 cylinder where G to T conversion of the GCT codon resulted in a conversion of alanine to serine. This is qualitatively the same mutational switch of alanine to serine in resistant strains previously reported to have occurred in cyclodiene-resistant Drosophila melanogaster, Aedes aegypti and Blattella germanica, indicating that this amino acid change is the likely cause for evolution of the nerve insensitive type of resistance to cyclodiene insecticides.",1995,"M Miyazaki, F Matsumura, R W Beeman, M Miyazaki, F Matsumura, R W Beeman"

Four of the 51 recovered deleted strains have lost modulo, the distalmost essential gene on chromosome 3R. Breakpoints of 22 deletions have been localised in a single hybridisation step, using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to separate genomic DNA fragments obtained from digestion with a rare-cutter restriction enzyme. Breaks do not occur at random, but are rather clustered in three susceptible chromosomal domains. Backcross experiments resulting in transheterozygous (deleted chromosome/45-4) animals indicate that the activity of the white transgene is enhanced when the DNA break has occurred proximal to a critical position. This suggests that homologous chromosomal pairing distal to the critical position results in the definition of a more compact chromatin structure and, due to position effect, in the silencing of white.",1995,"P Laurenti, Y Graba, R Rosset, J Pradel, P Laurenti, Y Graba, R Rosset, J Pradel"

Work shown here provides evidence that an analogous signaling pathway exists in Drosophila melanogaster. Because many of the ligand-receptor pairs in Drosophila have not been fully characterized, it was necessary to bypass the receptor stimulation event that normally triggers intracellular Jak/Stat activation. This was done by treating Drosophila Schneider 2 cells with vanadate/peroxide, which has been shown to closely mimic some signaling events triggered by interferon gamma, including the activation of Jak1, Jak2, and the Stat1 alpha protein. Evidence presented here demonstrates that vanadate/peroxide can induce a gamma response region binding complex in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells. This complex contains two phosphoproteins of 100 and 150 kDa, respectively, and shares many features with the vanadate/peroxide-stimulated binding complex in the mammalian system.

The basis for a heat-induced developmental defect: defining crucial lesions,7557378,10.1101/gad.9.18.2240,"Because lethal heat shocks perturb a multitude of cellular processes, the primary lesions responsible for death from heat stress remain to be defined. In Drosophila, sublethal heat treatments produce developmental anomalies that frequently mimic the effects of known mutations and are hence referred to as phenocopies. Mutations subject to phenocopy mimicry provide signposts to those biological processes most sensitive to heat and most important for the function and survival of the organism as a whole. We have analyzed a particular developmental defect inducible in early embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. By molecular, phenotypic, and genetic criteria, we have found extensive parallels between this phenocopy and certain dominant mutations in the segmentation gene fushi tarazu (ftz). Our analysis of this phenocopy indicates that the crucial lesion is interference with proper turnover of ftz protein, resulting in ftz overexpression. Our results provide a novel explanation for a heat-induced developmental defect. Perturbations in relative amounts of important regulatory proteins may be a common mechanism by which heat-shock phenocopies arise.",1995,"M A Welte, I Duncan, S Lindquist, M A Welte, I Duncan, S Lindquist"

One major haplotype concerning the occupied sites of the transposable elements was identified in the In(2L)t-carrying chromosomes. This haplotype is suggested to be the ancestral one. The age of the inversion in this local population was estimated to be 1,400 generations. The transposition rates of these elements were estimated based on the age of the inversion and the number of the elements lost and gained. The excision rates were in the range from 9.13 x 10(-5) to 2.25 x 10(-4) per site per generation. They were similar each other in the copia-like elements as well as in the LINE-like elements. The rate was higher in the copia-like elements than in the LINE-like elements. Insertions occurred in the range from 6.79 x 10(-4) to 9.05 x 10(-4) per element per generation.

The cell cycle-dependent localization of the CP190 centrosomal protein is determined by the coordinate action of two separable domains,8522588,10.1083/jcb.131.5.1261,"CP190, a protein of 1,096 amino acids from Drosophila melanogaster, oscillates in a cell cycle-specific manner between the nucleus during interphase, and the centrosome during mitosis. To characterize the regions of CP190 responsible for its dynamic behavior, we injected rhodamine-labeled fusion proteins spanning most of CP190 into early Drosophila embryos, where their localizations were characterized using time-lapse fluorescence confocal microscopy. A single bipartite 19-amino acid nuclear localization signal was detected that causes nuclear localization. Robust centrosomal localization is conferred by a separate region of 124 amino acids; two adjacent, nonoverlapping fusion proteins containing distinct portions of this region show weaker centrosomal localization. Fusion proteins that contain both nuclear and centrosomal localization sequences oscillate between the nucleus and the centrosome in a manner identical to native CP190. Fusion proteins containing only the centrosome localization sequence are found at centrosomes throughout the cell cycle, suggesting that CP190 is actively recruited away from the centrosome by its movement into the nucleus during interphase. Both native and bacterially expressed CP190 cosediment with microtubules in vitro. Tests with fusion proteins show that the domain responsible for microtubule binding overlaps the domain required for centrosomal localization. CP60, a protein identified by its association with CP190, also localizes to centrosomes and to nuclei in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Experiments in which colchicine is used to depolymerize microtubules in the early Drosophila embryo demonstrate that both CP190 and CP60 are able to attain and maintain their centrosomal localization in the absence of microtubules.",1995,"K Oegema, W G Whitfield, B Alberts, K Oegema, W G Whitfield, B Alberts"

Genetic screens for mutants with altered responsiveness to ethanol have been carried out and a few of the disrupted genes have been identified. This analysis, while still in its early stages, has already revealed some surprising molecular parallels with mammals.

Different regulatory mechanisms underlie similar transposable element profiles in pufferfish and fruitflies,15342795,10.1093/molbev/msh243,"Comparative analysis of recently sequenced eukaryotic genomes has uncovered extensive variation in transposable element (TE) abundance, diversity, and distribution. The TE profile in the sequenced pufferfish genomes is more similar to that of Drosophila melanogaster than to human or mouse, in that pufferfish TEs exhibit low overall abundance, high family diversity, and localization in the heterochromatin. It has been suggested that selection against the deleterious effects of ectopic recombination between TEs has structured the TE profile in Drosophila and pufferfish but not in humans. We test this hypothesis by measuring the sample frequency of 48 euchromatic TE insertions in the genome of the green spotted pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis). We estimate the strength of selection acting on recent insertions by analyzing the site frequency spectrum using a maximum-likelihood approach. We show that in contrast to Drosophila, euchromatic TE insertions in Tetraodon are selectively neutral and that the low copy number and compartmentalized distribution of TEs in the Tetraodon genome must be caused by regulation by means other than purifying selection acting on recent insertions. Inference of regulatory processes governing TE profiles should take into account factors such as effective population size, incidence of inbreeding/outcrossing, and other species-specific traits.",2004,"Daniel E Neafsey, Justin P Blumenstiel, Daniel L Hartl, Daniel E Neafsey, Justin P Blumenstiel, Daniel L Hartl"
End-joining repair of double-strand breaks in Drosophila melanogaster is largely DNA ligase IV independent,15611176,10.1534/genetics.104.033902,"Repair of DNA double-strand breaks can occur by either nonhomologous end joining or homologous recombination. Most nonhomologous end joining requires a specialized ligase, DNA ligase IV (Lig4). In Drosophila melanogaster, double-strand breaks created by excision of a P element are usually repaired by a homologous recombination pathway called synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA). SDSA requires strand invasion mediated by DmRad51, the product of the spn-A gene. In spn-A mutants, repair proceeds through a nonconservative pathway involving the annealing of microhomologies found within the 17-nt overhangs produced by P excision. We report here that end joining of P-element breaks in the absence of DmRad51 does not require Drosophila LIG4. In wild-type flies, SDSA is sometimes incomplete, and repair is finished by an end-joining pathway that also appears to be independent of LIG4. Loss of LIG4 does not increase sensitivity to ionizing radiation in late-stage larvae, but lig4 spn-A double mutants do show heightened sensitivity relative to spn-A single mutants. Together, our results suggest that a LIG4-independent end-joining pathway is responsible for the majority of double-strand break repair in the absence of homologous recombination in flies.",2004,"Mitch McVey, Dora Radut, Jeff J Sekelsky, Mitch McVey, Dora Radut, Jeff J Sekelsky"
Dynactin is required to maintain nuclear position within postmitotic Drosophila photoreceptor neurons,15329347,10.1242/dev.01366,"How a nucleus is positioned within a highly polarized postmitotic animal cell is not well understood. In this work, we demonstrate that the Dynactin complex (a regulator of the microtubule motor protein Dynein) is required to maintain the position of the nucleus within post-mitotic Drosophila melanogaster photoreceptor neurons. We show that multiple independent disruptions of Dynactin function cause a relocation of the photoreceptor nucleus toward the brain, and that inhibiting Dynactin causes the photoreceptor to acquire a bipolar appearance with long leading and trailing processes. We find that while the minus-end directed motor Dynein cooperates with Dynactin in positioning the photoreceptor nucleus, the plus-end directed microtubule motor Kinesin acts antagonistically to Dynactin. These data suggest that the maintenance of photoreceptor nuclear position depends on a balance of plus-end and minus-end directed microtubule motor function.",2004,"Jessica L Whited, Andre Cassell, Monique Brouillette, Paul A Garrity, Jessica L Whited, Andre Cassell, Monique Brouillette, Paul A Garrity"

The barrier preventing genetic analysis of hybrid inviability and sterility has been taken away by the discovery of a D. simulans strain which produces fertile female hybrids. D. simulans genes in the cytological locations of 21A1 to 22C1-23B1 and 30F3-31C5 to 36A2-7 have been introgressed into the D. melanogaster genetic background by consecutive backcrosses. Flies heterozygous for the introgression are fertile, while homozygotes are sterile both in females and males. The genes responsible for the sterility have been mapped in the introgression. The male sterility is caused by the synergistic effect of multiple genes, while the female sterility genes have been localized to a 170 kb region (32D2 to 32E4) containing 20 open reading frames. Thus, the female sterility might be attributed to a single gene with a large effect. We have also found that the Lethal hybrid rescue mutation which prevents the inviability of male hybrids from the cross of D. melanogaster females and D. simulans males cannot rescue those carrying the introgression, suggesting that D. simulans genes maybe non-functional in this hybrid genotype.

In muc209 hybrids the mutation rate was not affected. In mei-41 hybrids the tendency to decreasing of the mutation rate was found. The obtained results demonstrate the possible role of error-prone repair in the inducing of mutations in the unirradiated X-chromosome in the presence of irradiated homologue.,2004,"M V Shaposhnikov, V G ZaÄ­nullin, I N Belogolov, M V Shaposhnikov, V G ZaÄ­nullin, I N Belogolov"

In addition, the relationship between body mass and metabolic rate was determined for flies recently collected from wild populations. In no case was there a significant correlation between body mass and metabolic rate.

Selective expansion of the newly evolved genomic variants of retrotransposon 1731 in the Drosophila genomes,15356284,10.1093/molbev/msh247,"The structural variants of the regulatory and coding regions of the LTR-retrotransposon 1731 are described. Two classes of genomic copies of retrotransposon 1731, with and without frameshifting strategy to express Gag and Pol proteins, were earlier revealed in the D. melanogaster genome. Copies without frameshifting are shown to be evolved from an ancient variant with frameshifting and are widespread in the genomes of the melanogaster complex species. Position of a rare codon responsible for ribosome pausing and efficient frameshifting is identified. Two structural variants of 1731 LTRs were detected in the melanogaster complex species: the predominant structural variant A1A2 of 1731 LTR in the D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. sechellia genomes contains duplicated and diverged copies of 28 bp in the U3 region, whereas A1 variant lacking this duplication is expanded in the D. mauritiana genome. Selective expansion of the A1A2 variant was detected in the independently established D. melanogaster cell cultures. A1A2 variant is expressed in embryos, cell culture, and testes, whereas A1 is expressed only in testes of D. melanogaster. Relief of expression of the A1A2 but not A1 variant in the ovaries as a result of mutation in the RNA interference (RNAi) spn-E gene is shown.

"Testing the ""rate of living"" model: further evidence that longevity and metabolic rate are not inversely correlated in Drosophila melanogaster",15234957,10.1152/japplphysiol.00505.2004,"In a recent study examining the relationship between longevity and metabolism in a large number of recombinant inbred Drosophila melanogaster lines, we found no indication of the inverse relationship between longevity and metabolic rate that one would expect under the classical ""rate of living"" model. A potential limitation in generalizing from that study is that it was conducted on experimental material derived from a single set of parental strains originally developed over 20 years ago. To determine whether the observations made with those lines are characteristic of the species, we studied metabolic rates and longevities in a second, independently derived set of recombinant inbred lines. We found no correlation in these lines between metabolic rate and longevity, indicating that the ability to both maintain a normal metabolic rate and have extended longevity may apply to D. melanogaster in general. To determine how closely our measurements reflect metabolic rates of flies maintained under conditions of life span assays, we used long-term, flow-through metabolic rate measurements and closed system respirometry to examine the effects of variables such as time of day, feeding state, fly density, mobility of the flies, and nitrogen knockout on D. melanogaster metabolic rate.

Duplication-degeneration as a mechanism of gene fission and the origin of new genes in Drosophila species,15064762,10.1038/ng1338,"Gene fission and fusion, the processes by which a single gene is split into two separate genes and two adjacent genes are fused into a single gene, respectively, are among the primary processes that generate new genes. Despite their seeming reversibility, nothing is known about the mechanism of gene fission. Because the nucleotide sequences of fission genes record little about their origination process, conventional analysis of duplicate genes may not be powerful enough to unravel the underlying mechanism. In a survey for young genes in species of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we identified a young gene family, monkey king, whose genesis sheds light on the evolutionary process of gene fission. Its members originated 1-2 million years ago as retroposed duplicates and evolved into fission genes that separately encode protein domains from a multidomain ancestor. The mechanism underlying this process is gene duplication with subsequent partial degeneration.",2004,"Wen Wang, Haijing Yu, Manyuan Long, Wen Wang, Haijing Yu, Manyuan Long"

Targeted expression of the class II phosphoinositide 3-kinase in Drosophila melanogaster reveals lipid kinase-dependent effects on patterning and interactions with receptor signaling pathways,14701751,10.1128/mcb.24.2.796-808.2004,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) can be divided into three distinct classes (I, II, and III) on the basis of their domain structures and the lipid signals that they generate. Functions have been assigned to the class I and class III enzymes but have not been established for the class II PI3Ks. We have obtained the first evidence for a biological function for a class II PI3K by expressing this enzyme during Drosophila melanogaster development and by using deficiencies that remove the endogenous gene. Wild-type and catalytically inactive PI3K_68D transgenes have opposite effects on the number of sensory bristles and on wing venation phenotypes induced by modified epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling. These results indicate that the endogenous PI3K_68D may act antagonistically to the EGF receptor-stimulated Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and downstream of, or parallel to, the Notch receptor. A class II polyproline motif in PI3K_68D can bind the Drk adaptor protein in vitro, primarily via the N-terminal SH3 domain of Drk. Drk may thus be important for the localization of PI3K_68D, allowing it to modify signaling pathways downstream of cell surface receptors. The phenotypes obtained are markedly distinct from those generated by expression of the Drosophila class I PI3K, which affects growth but not pattern formation.",2004,"Lindsay K MacDougall, Mary Elizabeth Gagou, Sally J Leevers, Ernst Hafen, Michael D Waterfield, Lindsay K MacDougall, Mary Elizabeth Gagou, Sally J Leevers, Ernst Hafen, Michael D Waterfield"
The effect of learning on experimental evolution of resource preference in Drosophila melanogaster,15154552,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2004.tb00409.x,"Learning is thought to be adaptive in variable environments, whereas constant, predictable environments are supposed to favor unconditional, genetically fixed responses. A dichotomous view of behavior as either learned or innate ignores a potential evolutionary interaction between the learned and innate components of a behavioral response. We addressed this interaction in the context of oviposition substrate choice in Drosophila melanogaster, asking two main questions. First, will learning also evolve in a constant environment in which it always pays to show the same choice? Second, how does an opportunity to learn affect the evolution of the innate (genetic) component of oviposition substrate choice? We exposed experimental populations to four selection regimes, involving selection on oviposition substrate preference (an orange versus a pineapple medium). In two selection regimes the flies were selected for preference either for the orange medium, or for the pineapple medium. In the remaining two selection regimes the flies were also selected for preference for either orange or pineapple, but additionally could use past experience (aversion learning) to decide which medium it paid to avoid. Lines exposed to the latter selection regimes evolved improved learning ability, indicating that learning may be advantageous even if the same behavioral response is favored every generation. Furthermore, of the two selection regimes that favored oviposition on the pineapple medium, the regime that allowed for learning led to the evolution of a stronger innate preference for pineapple, than the regime that did not allow for learning. In contrast, of the two regimes that selected for oviposition on the orange medium, the one that allowed for learning led to a smaller evolutionary change of the innate preference. Thus, an opportunity to learn facilitated the evolution of innate preference under selection for preference for pineapple, but hindered it under selection for preference for orange. We discuss possible mechanisms for this effect.",2004,"Frederic Mery, Tadeusz J Kawecki, Frederic Mery, Tadeusz J Kawecki"
Sequences upstream of the homologous cis-elements of the Adh adult enhancer of Drosophila are required for maximal levels of Adh gene transcription in adults of Scaptodrosophila lebanonensis,15166155,10.1534/genetics.167.1.289,"The evolution of cis-regulatory elements is of particular interest for our understanding of the evolution of gene regulation. The Adh gene of Drosophilidae shows interspecific differences in tissue-specific expression and transcript levels during development. In Scaptodrosophila lebanonensis adults, the level of distal transcripts is maximal between the fourth and eighth day after eclosion and is around five times higher than that in D. melanogaster Adh(S). To examine whether these quantitative differences are regulated by sequences lying upstream of the distal promoter, we performed in vitro deletion mutagenesis of the Adh gene of S. lebanonensis, followed by P-element-mediated germ-line transformation. All constructs included, as a cotransgene, a modified Adh gene of D. melanogaster (dAdh) in a fixed position and orientation that acted as a chromosomal position control. Using this approach, we have identified a fragment of 1.5 kb in the 5' region, 830 bp upstream of the distal start site, which is required to achieve maximal levels of distal transcript in S. lebanonensis. The presence of this fragment produces a 3.5-fold higher level of distal mRNA (as determined by real time quantitative PCR) compared with the D. melanogaster dAdh cotransgene. This region contains the degenerated end of a minisatellite sequence expanding farther upstream and does not correspond to the Adh adult enhancer (AAE) of D. melanogaster. Indeed, the cis-regulatory elements of the AAE have been identified by phylogenetic footprinting within the region 830 bp upstream of the distal start site of S. lebanonensis. Furthermore, the deletions Delta-830 and Delta-2358 yield the same pattern of tissue-specific expression, indicating that all tissue-specific elements are contained within the region 830 bp upstream of the distal start site.",2004,"Montserrat Papaceit, Dorcas Orengo, Elvira Juan, Montserrat Papaceit, Dorcas Orengo, Elvira Juan"

Thermosensitive lines displayed significantly higher rates of change in the DNA fingerprint pattern after mutagenic presyngamic treatment followed by development at both temperatures, as well as after development under high temperature with no prior mutagenic treatment. The thermotolerant lines tended to show a lower level of mutation at both temperatures and after both treatments. One isofemale line showed a higher level of mutation at room temperature compared with increased temperature, after both control and mutagen treatment.

Sleep homeostasis in Drosophila melanogaster,15282997,10.1093/sleep/27.4.628,"Study objectives:
      
    

    
      The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is emerging as a promising model system for the genetic dissection of sleep. As in mammals, sleep in the fruit fly is a reversible state of reduced responsiveness to the external world and has been defined using an array of behavioral, pharmacologic, molecular, and electrophysiologic criteria. A central feature of mammalian sleep is its homeostatic regulation by the amount of previous wakefulness. Dissecting the mechanisms of homeostatic regulation is likely to provide key insights into the functions of sleep. Thus, it is important to establish to what extent sleep homeostasis is similar between mammals and flies. This study was designed to determine whether in flies, as in mammals, (1) sleep rebound is dependent on prior time awake; (2) sleep deprivation affects the intensity, in addition to the duration, of sleep rebound; (3) sleep loss impairs vigilance and performance; (4) the sleep homeostatic response is conserved among different wild-type lines, and between female and male flies of the same line.
    

    
  


        Design:
      
    

    
      Motor activity of individual flies was recorded at 1-minute intervals using the infrared Drosophila Activity Monitoring System during 2 baseline days; during 6, 12, and 24 hours of sleep deprivation; and during 2 days of recovery. Sleep was defined as any period of uninterrupted behavioral immobility lasting > 5 minutes. Sleep continuity was measured by calculating the number of brief awakenings, the number and duration of sleep episodes, and a sleep continuity score. Vigilance before and after sleep deprivation was assessed by measuring the escape response triggered by 2 different aversive stimuli.
    

    
  


        Setting:
      
    

    
      Fly sleep research laboratory at UW-Madison.
    

    
  


        Participants and interventions:
      
    

    
      Adult flies of the Canton-S (CS) strain and 116 other wild-type lines (> or = 16 female and > or = 16 male flies per line).
    

    
  


        Measurements and results:
      
    

    
      In wild-type CS flies, as in mammals, the amount of sleep recovered after sleep deprivation was dependent on prior time awake. Relative to baseline sleep, recovery sleep in CS flies was less fragmented, with longer sleep episodes, and was associated with a higher arousal threshold. Sleep deprivation in CS flies also reduced performance. Sleep duration and continuity increased after 24 hour of sleep deprivation in all the other wild-type lines tested.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The sleep homeostatic response in fruit flies is a stable phenotype and shares most of, if not all, the major features of mammalian sleep homeostasis, thus supporting the use of Drosophila as a model system for the genetic dissection of sleep mechanisms and functions.",2004,"Reto Huber, Sean L Hill, Carie Holladay, Melissa Biesiadecki, Giulio Tononi, Chiara Cirelli, Reto Huber, Sean L Hill, Carie Holladay, Melissa Biesiadecki, Giulio Tononi, Chiara Cirelli"

We have shown that RNAi knock down of either the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (Ins(1,4,5)P(3)R), or the SERCA calcium pump in the S2-DM1 cells blocks the increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) resulting from activation of the DM1 receptor by 100 microM carbamylcholine (CCh). When RNAi designed to knock down the ryanodine receptor (RyR) was tested, there was no change in the calcium increase detected in response to CCh, consistent with a failure to detect RyRs in S2-DM1 cells using RT-PCR. A combination of RNAi and calcium imaging has provided a direct demonstration of key roles for the Ins(1,4,5)P(3)R and the SERCA pump in the response to DM1 receptor activation.Thus, we show that silencing of individual genes by RNAi in a well characterised Drosophila S2 cell line offers experimental opportunities for cell-signalling studies.

The control experiments show that the impairment could not be ascribed to any apparent sensorimotor problems in Drosophila. The reverse shift from hypomagnetic field (HMF) to natural GMF restored the GMF-free induced amnesia fully after six consecutive generations.

Our models reproduce gap gene expression at high accuracy and temporal resolution. Regulatory interactions found in gap gene circuits provide consistent and sufficient mechanisms for gap gene expression, which largely agree with mechanisms previously inferred from qualitative studies of mutant gene expression patterns. Our models predict activation of Kr by Cad and clarify several other regulatory interactions. Our analysis suggests a central role for repressive feedback loops between complementary gap genes.

Drosophila melanogaster as a model host for Staphylococcus aureus infection,15256576,10.1099/mic.0.27116-0,"Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen of humans, causing a range of superficial and potentially life-threatening diseases. Infection of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster with S. aureus results in systemic infection followed by death. Screening of defined S. aureus mutants for components important in pathogenesis identified perR and pheP, with fly death up to threefold slower after infection with the respective mutants compared to the wild-type. Infection of D. melanogaster with reporter gene fusion strains demonstrated the in vivo expression levels of the accessory gene regulator, agr, alpha-toxin, hla, and a manganese transporter, mntA. The use of the green fluorescent protein as a reporter under the control of the agr promoter (P3) showed S. aureus microcolony formation in vivo. The disease model also allowed the effect of antibiotic treatment on the flies to be determined.

"Dop1R1, a type 1 dopaminergic receptor expressed in Mushroom Bodies, modulates Drosophila larval locomotion",32101569,10.1371/journal.pone.0229671,"As in vertebrates, dopaminergic neural systems are key regulators of motor programs in insects, including the fly Drosophila melanogaster. Dopaminergic systems innervate the Mushroom Bodies (MB), an important association area in the insect brain primarily associated to olfactory learning and memory, but that has been also implicated with the execution of motor programs. The main objectives of this work is to assess the idea that dopaminergic systems contribute to the execution of motor programs in Drosophila larvae, and then, to evaluate the contribution of specific dopaminergic receptors expressed in MB to these programs. Our results show that animals bearing a mutation in the dopamine transporter show reduced locomotion, while mutants for the dopaminergic biosynthetic enzymes or the dopamine receptor Dop1R1 exhibit increased locomotion. Pan-neuronal expression of an RNAi for the Dop1R1 confirmed these results. Further studies show that animals expressing the RNAi for Dop1R1 in the entire MB neuronal population or only in the MB Î³-lobe forming neurons, exhibit an increased motor output, as well. Interestingly, our results also suggest that other dopaminergic receptors do not contribute to larval motor behavior. Thus, our data support the proposition that CNS dopamine systems innervating MB neurons modulate larval locomotion and that Dop1R1 mediates this effect.",2020,"Bryon Silva, Sergio Hidalgo, Jorge M Campusano, Bryon Silva, Sergio Hidalgo, Jorge M Campusano"
Rapid evolution of piRNA-mediated silencing of an invading transposable element was driven by abundant de novo mutations,32238416,10.1101/gr.251546.119,"The regulation of transposable element (TE) activity by small RNAs is a ubiquitous feature of germlines. However, despite the obvious benefits to the host in terms of ensuring the production of viable gametes and maintaining the integrity of the genomes they carry, it remains controversial whether TE regulation evolves adaptively. We examined the emergence and evolutionary dynamics of repressor alleles after P-elements invaded the Drosophila melanogaster genome in the mid-twentieth century. In many animals including Drosophila, repressor alleles are produced by transpositional insertions into piRNA clusters, genomic regions encoding the Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that regulate TEs. We discovered that ??4% of recently collected isofemale lines in the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) contain at least one P-element insertion in a piRNA cluster, indicating that repressor alleles are produced by de novo insertion at an exceptional rate. Furthermore, in our sample of approximately 200 genomes, we uncovered no fewer than 80 unique P-element insertion alleles in at least 15 different piRNA clusters. Finally, we observe no footprint of positive selection on P-element insertions in piRNA clusters, suggesting that the rapid evolution of piRNA-mediated repression in D. melanogaster was driven primarily by mutation. Our results reveal for the first time how the unique genetic architecture of piRNA production, in which numerous piRNA clusters can encode regulatory small RNAs upon transpositional insertion, facilitates the nonadaptive rapid evolution of repression.",2020,"Shuo Zhang, Beverly Pointer, Erin S Kelleher, Shuo Zhang, Beverly Pointer, Erin S Kelleher"
Taxon-Specific Effects of Lactobacillus on Drosophila Host Development,31250075,10.1007/s00248-019-01404-9,"Commensal microbiota heavily influence metazoan host physiology. Drosophila melanogaster has been proven a valuable animal model for studying many aspects of host-microbiota interaction. Lactobacillus are the most common human probiotics and are also one of the major symbiotic bacteria in Drosophila. Although the beneficial effects of Lactobacillus on fly development and physiology have been recognized, how broadly these effects are observed across the Lactobacillus taxa remains largely unknown. In this study, four Lactobacillus species including five strains of L. plantarum were examined for their effects on fly larval development. Monoassociation of germ-free flies with L. rhamnosus (GG) most strongly accelerated fly larval development. Monoassociation with L. plantarum moderately accelerated fly development, but monoassociation with L. reuteri or L. sakei had marginal effects, despite similar bacterial loads in the host gut. An L. plantarum strain previously isolated from our lab rarely enhanced larval development, confirming the strain-specific effects of L. plantarum. The correlation between development-promoting effects and protein digestion activity in the host gut was found only among the members of L. plantarum species. Moreover, the cytoprotective response in the host gut known to be induced by L. plantarum was not correlated with development-promoting effects among any of the bacteria tested. Our results suggest that a broad range of Lactobacillus taxa are able to reside in the fly gut, but their ability to enhance host larval development is highly varied. This study may aid our understanding of the basic principles underlying the beneficial effects of probiotic commensal bacteria on metazoan development.",2020,"Jaegeun Lee, Gangsik Han, Jae Woon Kim, Che Ok Jeon, Seogang Hyun, Jaegeun Lee, Gangsik Han, Jae Woon Kim, Che Ok Jeon, Seogang Hyun"
Fine-Scale Position Effects Shape the Distribution of Inversion Breakpoints in Drosophila melanogaster,32437518,10.1093/gbe/evaa103,"Chromosomal inversions are among the primary drivers of genome structure evolution in a wide range of natural populations. Although there is an impressive array of theory and empirical analyses that have identified conditions under which inversions can be positively selected, comparatively little data are available on the fitness impacts of these genome structural rearrangements themselves. Because inversion breakpoints can disrupt functional elements and alter chromatin domains, the precise positioning of an inversion's breakpoints can strongly affect its fitness. Here, we compared the fine-scale distribution of low-frequency inversion breakpoints with those of high-frequency inversions and inversions that have gone to fixation between Drosophila species. We identified a number of differences among frequency classes that may influence inversion fitness. In particular, breakpoints that are proximal to insulator elements, generate large tandem duplications, and minimize impacts on gene coding spans which are more prevalent in high-frequency and fixed inversions than in rare inversions. The data suggest that natural selection acts to preserve both genes and larger cis-regulatory networks in the occurrence and spread of rearrangements. These factors may act to limit the availability of high-fitness arrangements when suppressed recombination is favorable.",2020,"Jakob McBroome, David Liang, Russell Corbett-Detig, Jakob McBroome, David Liang, Russell Corbett-Detig"
Identification of potential mechanosensitive ion channels involved in texture discrimination during Drosophila suzukii egg-laying behaviour,32596943,10.1111/imb.12654,"Drosophila suzukii (spotted wing drosophila) has become a major invasive insect pest of soft fruits in the America and Europe, causing severe yield losses every year. The female D. suzukii shows the oviposition preference for ripening or ripe fruit by cutting the hard skin with its serrated ovipositor. A recent study reported that mechanosensation is involved in the texture discrimination during egg-laying behaviour in D. suzukii. However, the underlying mechanism and molecular entity that control this behaviour are not known. The transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and degenerin/epithelial sodium channels (DEG/ENaC) are two candidate gene families of mechanically activated ion channels. Thus, we first identified TRP and DEG/ENaC genes in D. suzukii by bioinformatic analysis. Using transcriptome sequencing, we found that many TRP genes were expressed in the ovipositor in both D. suzukii and D. melanogaster, while some DEG/ENaCs showed species-specific expression patterns. Exposure to drugs targeting TRP and DEG/ENaC channels abolished the oviposition preference for harder texture in female D. suzukii. Therefore, mechanosensitive ion channels may play significant roles in the texture assessment of egg-laying behaviour in D. suzukii, which has promising implications to further research on the development of novel control measures.",2020,"L Guo, Z-D Zhou, F Mao, X-Y Fan, G-Y Liu, J Huang, X-M Qiao, L Guo, Z-D Zhou, F Mao, X-Y Fan, G-Y Liu, J Huang, X-M Qiao"
Stable intronic sequence RNAs have possible regulatory roles in Drosophila melanogaster,26504165,10.1083/jcb.201507065,"Stable intronic sequence RNAs (sisRNAs) have been found in Xenopus tropicalis, human cell lines, and Epstein-Barr virus; however, the biological significance of sisRNAs remains poorly understood. We identify sisRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster by deep sequencing, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and Northern blotting. We characterize a sisRNA (sisR-1) from the regena (rga) locus and show that it can be processed from the precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). We also document a cis-natural antisense transcript (ASTR) from the rga locus, which is highly expressed in early embryos. During embryogenesis, ASTR promotes robust rga pre-mRNA expression. Interestingly, sisR-1 represses ASTR, with consequential effects on rga pre-mRNA expression. Our results suggest a model in which sisR-1 modulates its host gene expression by repressing ASTR during embryogenesis. We propose that sisR-1 belongs to a class of sisRNAs with probable regulatory activities in Drosophila.",2015,"Jun Wei Pek, Ismail Osman, Mandy Li-Ian Tay, Ruther Teo Zheng, Jun Wei Pek, Ismail Osman, Mandy Li-Ian Tay, Ruther Teo Zheng"
Gut physiology mediates a trade-off between adaptation to malnutrition and susceptibility to food-borne pathogens,26249109,10.1111/ele.12490,"The animal gut plays a central role in tackling two common ecological challenges, nutrient shortage and food-borne parasites, the former by efficient digestion and nutrient absorption, the latter by acting as an immune organ and a barrier. It remains unknown whether these functions can be independently optimised by evolution, or whether they interfere with each other. We report that Drosophila melanogaster populations adapted during 160 generations of experimental evolution to chronic larval malnutrition became more susceptible to intestinal infection with the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas entomophila. However, they do not show suppressed immune response or higher bacterial loads. Rather, their increased susceptibility to P. entomophila is largely mediated by an elevated predisposition to loss of intestinal barrier integrity upon infection. These results may reflect a trade-off between the efficiency of nutrient extraction from poor food and the protective function of the gut, in particular its tolerance to pathogen-induced damage.",2015,"Roshan K Vijendravarma, Sunitha Narasimha, Sveta Chakrabarti, Aurelie Babin, Sylvain Kolly, Bruno Lemaitre, Tadeusz J Kawecki, Roshan K Vijendravarma, Sunitha Narasimha, Sveta Chakrabarti, Aurelie Babin, Sylvain Kolly, Bruno Lemaitre, Tadeusz J Kawecki"
Loss of Drosophila pheromone reverses its role in sexual communication in Drosophila suzukii,25716789,10.1098/rspb.2014.3018,"The Drosophila pheromone cis-11-octadecenyl acetate (cVA) is used as pheromone throughout the melanogaster group and fulfils a primary role in sexual and social behaviours. Here, we found that Drosophila suzukii, an invasive pest that oviposits in undamaged ripe fruit, does not produce cVA. In fact, its production site, the ejaculatory bulb, is atrophied. Despite loss of cVA production, its receptor, Or67d, and cognate sensillum, T1, which are essential in cVA-mediated behaviours, were fully functional. However, T1 expression was dramatically reduced in D. suzukii, and the corresponding antennal lobe glomerulus, DA1, minute. Behavioural responses to cVA depend on the input balance of Or67d neurons (driving cVA-mediated behaviours) and Or65a neurons (inhibiting cVA-mediated behaviours). Accordingly, the shifted input balance in D. suzukii has reversed cVA's role in sexual behaviour: perfuming D. suzukii males with Drosophila melanogaster equivalents of cVA strongly reduced mating rates. cVA has thus evolved from a generic sex pheromone to a heterospecific signal that disrupts mating in D. suzukii, a saltational shift, mediated through offsetting the input balance that is highly conserved in congeneric species.

Transcriptome analyses of Drosophila S2 cells and adult flies revealed strong induction of the heat shock response upon RNA virus infection. Dynamic induction patterns of heat shock pathway components were characterized in vitro and in vivo following infection with different classes of viruses. The heat shock transcription factor (Hsf), as well as active viral replication, were necessary for the induction of the response. Hsf-deficient adult flies were hypersensitive to virus infection, indicating a role of the heat shock response in antiviral defence. In accordance, transgenic activation of the heat shock response prolonged survival time after infection and enabled long-term control of virus replication to undetectable levels.

"The Mammalian Orthologs of Drosophila Lgd, CC2D1A and CC2D1B, Function in the Endocytic Pathway, but Their Individual Loss of Function Does Not Affect Notch Signalling",26720614,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005749,"CC2D1A and CC2D1B belong to the evolutionary conserved Lgd protein family with members in all multi-cellular animals. Several functions such as centrosomal cleavage, involvement in signalling pathways, immune response and synapse maturation have been described for CC2D1A. Moreover, the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog Lgd was shown to be involved in the endosomal trafficking of the Notch receptor and other transmembrane receptors and physically interacts with the ESCRT-III component Shrub/CHMP4. To determine if this function is conserved in mammals we generated and characterized Cc2d1a and Cc2d1b conditional knockout mice. While Cc2d1b deficient mice displayed no obvious phenotype, we found that Cc2d1a deficient mice as well as conditional mutants that lack CC2D1A only in the nervous system die shortly after birth due to respiratory distress. This finding confirms the suspicion that the breathing defect is caused by the central nervous system. However, an involvement in centrosomal function could not be confirmed in Cc2d1a deficient MEF cells. To analyse an influence on Notch signalling, we generated intestine specific Cc2d1a mutant mice. These mice did not display any alterations in goblet cell number, proliferating cell number or expression of the Notch reporter Hes1-emGFP, suggesting that CC2D1A is not required for Notch signalling. However, our EM analysis revealed that the average size of endosomes of Cc2d1a mutant cells, but not Cc2d1b mutant cells, is increased, indicating a defect in endosomal morphogenesis. We could show that CC2D1A and its interaction partner CHMP4B are localised on endosomes in MEF cells, when the activity of the endosomal protein VPS4 is reduced. This indicates that CC2D1A cycles between the cytosol and the endosomal membrane. Additionally, in rescue experiments in D. melanogaster, CC2D1A and CC2D1B were able to functionally replace Lgd.

Previous modeling studies have suggested that D. suzukii might not survive in portions of the northern United States or southern Canada due to the effects of cold. As a result, we measured two aspects of insect cold tolerance, the supercooling point and lower lethal temperature, for D. suzukii summer-morph pupae and adults and winter-morph adults. Supercooling points were compared to adults of Drosophila melanogaster Meigen. The lower lethal temperature of D. suzukii winter-morph adults was significantly colder than that for D. suzukii summer-morph adults, while supercooling points of D. suzukii winter-morph adults were actually warmer than that for D. suzukii summer-morph adults and pupae. D. suzukii summer-morph adult supercooling points were not significantly different than those for D. melanogaster adults. These measures indicate that D. suzukii is a chill intolerant insect, and winter-morph adults are the most cold-tolerant life stage. These results can be used to improve predictions of where D. suzukii might be able to establish overwintering populations and cause extensive damage to spring fruit crops.",2015,"A R Stephens, M K Asplen, W D Hutchison, R C Venette, A R Stephens, M K Asplen, W D Hutchison, R C Venette"
Sex-specific behavioural symptoms of viral gut infection and Wolbachia in Drosophila melanogaster,26301521,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2015.08.005,"All organisms are infected with a range of symbionts spanning the spectrum of beneficial mutualists to detrimental parasites.

While the pathophysiology and immune responses against both symbionts are the focus of intense study, the behavioural effects of these infections have received less attention. Here we report sex-specific behavioural responses to these infections in D. melanogaster. DCV infection caused increased sleep in female flies, but had no detectable effect in male flies. The presence of Wolbachia did not reduce this behavioural response to viral infection. We also found evidence for a sex-specific cost of Wolbachia, as male flies infected with the endosymbiont became more lethargic when awake.

Dyeing insects for behavioral assays: the mating behavior of anesthetized Drosophila,25938821,10.3791/52645,"Mating experiments using Drosophila have contributed greatly to the understanding of sexual selection and behavior. Experiments often require simple, easy and cheap methods to distinguish between individuals in a trial. A standard technique for this is CO2 anaesthesia and then labelling or wing clipping each fly. However, this is invasive and has been shown to affect behavior. Other techniques have used coloration to identify flies. This article presents a simple and non-invasive method for labelling Drosophila that allows them to be individually identified within experiments, using food coloring. This method is used in trials where two males compete to mate with a female. Dyeing allowed quick and easy identification. There was, however, some difference in the strength of the coloration across the three species tested. Data is presented showing the dye has a lower impact on mating behavior than CO2 in Drosophila melanogaster. The impact of CO2 anaesthesia is shown to depend on the species of Drosophila, with D. pseudoobscura and D. subobscura showing no impact, whereas D. melanogaster males had reduced mating success.

Control of Sleep by Dopaminergic Inputs to the Drosophila Mushroom Body,26617493,10.3389/fncir.2015.00073,"The Drosophila mushroom body (MB) is an associative learning network that is important for the control of sleep. We have recently identified particular intrinsic MB Kenyon cell (KC) classes that regulate sleep through synaptic activation of particular MB output neurons (MBONs) whose axons convey sleep control signals out of the MB to downstream target regions. Specifically, we found that sleep-promoting KCs increase sleep by preferentially activating cholinergic sleep-promoting MBONs, while wake-promoting KCs decrease sleep by preferentially activating glutamatergic wake-promoting MBONs. Here we use a combination of genetic and physiological approaches to identify wake-promoting dopaminergic neurons (DANs) that innervate the MB, and show that they activate wake-promoting MBONs.

A re-examination of the selection of the sensory organ precursor of the bristle sensilla of Drosophila melanogaster,25569355,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004911,"The bristle sensillum of the imago of Drosophila is made of four cells that arise from a sensory organ precursor cell (SOP). This SOP is selected within proneural clusters (PNC) through a mechanism that involves Notch signalling. PNCs are defined through the expression domains of the proneural genes, whose activities enables cells to become SOPs. They encode tissue specific bHLH proteins that form functional heterodimers with the bHLH protein Daughterless (Da). In the prevailing lateral inhibition model for SOP selection, a transcriptional feedback loop that involves the Notch pathway amplifies small differences of proneural activity between cells of the PNC. As a result only one or two cells accumulate sufficient proneural activity to adopt the SOP fate. Most of the experiments that sustained the prevailing lateral inhibition model were performed a decade ago. We here re-examined the selection process using recently available reagents. Our data suggest a different picture of SOP selection. They indicate that a band-like region of proneural activity exists. In this proneural band the activity of the Notch pathway is required in combination with Emc to define the PNCs. We found a sub-group in the PNCs from which a pre-selected SOP arises. Our data indicate that most imaginal disc cells are able to adopt a proneural state from which they can progress to become SOPs. They further show that bristle formation can occur in the absence of the proneural genes if the function of emc is abolished. These results suggest that the tissue specific proneural proteins of Drosophila have a similar function as in the vertebrates, which is to determine the time of emergence and position of the SOP and to stabilise the proneural state.",2015,"Tobias Troost, Markus Schneider, Thomas Klein, Tobias Troost, Markus Schneider, Thomas Klein"

We have performed a phylogenetic analysis of Smyd protein sequences, and our results show that the extant metazoan Smyd genes can be classified in three main classes, Smyd3 (which includes chordate-specific Smyd1 and Smyd2 genes), Smyd4 and Smyd5. In addition, there is an arthropod-specific class, SmydA. While the evolutionary history of the Smyd3 and Smyd5 classes is relatively simple, the Smyd4 class has suffered several events of gene loss, gene duplication and lineage-specific expansions in the animal phyla included in our analysis.

Tachykinin acts upstream of autocrine Hedgehog signaling during nociceptive sensitization in Drosophila,26575288,10.7554/eLife.10735,"Pain signaling in vertebrates is modulated by neuropeptides like Substance P (SP). To determine whether such modulation is conserved and potentially uncover novel interactions between nociceptive signaling pathways we examined SP/Tachykinin signaling in a Drosophila model of tissue damage-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity.

Electrophysiological recording showed that DTKR99D is required in nociceptive sensory neurons for temperature-dependent increases in firing frequency upon tissue damage. DTKR overexpression caused both behavioral and electrophysiological thermal nociceptive hypersensitivity. Hedgehog, another key regulator of nociceptive sensitization, was produced by nociceptive sensory neurons following tissue damage.

Metabolomic profiling of permethrin-treated Drosophila melanogaster identifies a role for tryptophan catabolism in insecticide survival,26474926,10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.09.009,"Insecticides and associated synergists are rapidly losing efficacy in target insect pest populations making the discovery of alternatives a priority. To discover novel targets for permethrin synergists, metabolomics was performed on permethrin-treated Drosophila melanogaster. Changes were observed in several metabolic pathways including those for amino acids, glycogen, glycolysis, energy, nitrogen, NAD(+), purine, pyrimidine, lipids and carnitine. Markers for acidosis, ammonia stress, oxidative stress and detoxification responses were also observed. Many of these changes had not been previously characterized after permethrin exposure. From the altered pathways, tryptophan catabolism was selected for further investigation. The knockdown of some tryptophan catabolism genes (vermilion, cinnabar and CG6950) in the whole fly and in specific tissues including fat body, midgut and Malpighian tubules using targeted RNAi resulted in altered survival phenotypes against acute topical permethrin exposure. The knockdown of vermilion, cinnabar and CG6950 in the whole fly also altered survival phenotypes against chronic oral permethrin, fenvalerate, DDT, chlorpyriphos and hydramethylnon exposure.

Photoactivation of cryptochromes from Drosophila melanogaster and Sylvia borin: insight into the chemical compass mechanism by computational investigation,25710635,10.1021/jp508871h,"Although behavioral studies demonstrated light-induced magnetoreception in the insect Drosophila melanogaster, gaining insight into the possibility that a radical-pair mechanism accounts for the magnetic response of the cryptochrome (DmCry1) is complicated by a number of factors. In addition, the mechanism of magnetoreception for the cryptochrome from the garden warbler bird Sylvia borin (gwCry1a), which demonstrated a long-lived radical pair by transient optical absorption measurements, has also not been rationalized. To assess potential feasibility of a radical-pair mechanism in DmCry1 and gwCry1a, formed by excitation and electron transfer between a Trp-triad and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), further separated by electron transfer within the triad, we applied a combination of theoretical methods, including homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) for structure refinement, high-level ab initio theory, and MD simulations using a polarizable force-field for prediction of pKa and the electron transfer rate. Calculated excitation energies, followed by electron transfer in model compounds of DmCry1 that assume proton transfer in conjunction with electron transfer from Trp (W420) to FAD and the predicted pKa for the proximate residue to FAD (Cys416), support a radical-pair mechanism. Furthermore, free-energy and reorganization energies for the Trp-triad in DmCry1 demonstrate facile electron transfer, explained by the local protein environment and exposure to solvent, which in turn enables a large enough distance separation for the radical-pair partners. Results for gwCry1a demonstrated the importance of accounting for relaxed excited-state geometries in validating the first stage of a radical-pair mechanism. This work provides insight into the so-called chemical compass mechanism to explain magnetic-field sensing in DmCry1 and gwCry1a, expanding on previous work on the cyrptochrome from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Solov'yov et al.

To learn about the regulation of circadian rhythms in the retina and lamina and in two cell types, glial and the lamina L2 interneurons, we examined expression of the following clock genes; per, tim, clk, and cry and clock-controlled genes (ccgs); AtpÎ±, nrv2, brp, Pdfr. We found that the expression of gene studied is specific for the retina and lamina. The rhythms of per and tim expression in the retina and glial cells are similar to that observed in the whole head and in clock neurons, while they differ in the lamina and L2 cells. In both the retina and lamina, CRY seems to be a repressor of clk expression. In L2 interneurons per expression is not cyclic indicating the other function of PER in those cells than in the circadian molecular clock. In contrast to per and tim, the pattern of clk and cry expression is similar in both the retina and lamina. The retina holds the autonomous oscillators but the expression of cry and ccgs, AtpÎ± and nrv2, is also regulated by inputs from the pacemaker transmitted by PDF and ITP neuropeptides.",2015,"Milena Damulewicz, Agnieszka Loboda, Karolina Bukowska-Strakova, Alicja Jozkowicz, Jozef Dulak, Elzbieta Pyza, Milena Damulewicz, Agnieszka Loboda, Karolina Bukowska-Strakova, Alicja Jozkowicz, Jozef Dulak, Elzbieta Pyza"
Reversing Stimulus Timing in Visual Conditioning Leads to Memories with Opposite Valence in Drosophila,26430885,10.1371/journal.pone.0139797,"Animals need to associate different environmental stimuli with each other regardless of whether they temporally overlap or not. Drosophila melanogaster displays olfactory trace conditioning, where an odor is followed by electric shock reinforcement after a temporal gap, leading to conditioned odor avoidance. Reversing the stimulus timing in olfactory conditioning results in the reversal of memory valence such that an odor that follows shock is later on approached (i.e. relief conditioning). Here, we explored the effects of stimulus timing on memory in another sensory modality, using a visual conditioning paradigm. We found that flies form visual memories of opposite valence depending on stimulus timing and can associate a visual stimulus with reinforcement despite being presented with a temporal gap. These results suggest that associative memories with non-overlapping stimuli and the effect of stimulus timing on memory valence are shared across sensory modalities.",2015,"Katrin Vogt, Ayse Yarali, Hiromu Tanimoto, Katrin Vogt, Ayse Yarali, Hiromu Tanimoto"
Arm-Gal4 inheritance influences development and lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster,26505429,10.4238/2015.October.19.22,"The UAS-Gal4 ectopic expression system is a widely used and highly valued tool that allows specific gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster. Yeast transcription factor Gal4 can be directed using D. melanogaster transcriptional control elements, and is often assumed to have little effect on the organism. By evaluation of the consequences of maternal and paternal inheritance of a Gal4 transgene under the transcriptional regulation of armadillo control elements (arm-Gal4), we demonstrated that Gal4 expression could be detrimental to development and longevity. Male progeny expressing arm-Gal4 in the presence of UAS-lacZ transgene had reduced numbers and size of ommatidia, compared to flies expressing UAS-lacZ transgene under the control of other Gal4 transgenes. Aged at 25Â°C, the median life span of male flies with maternally inherited elav-Gal4 was 70 days, without a responding transgene or with UAS-lacZ. The median life span of maternally inherited arm-Gal4 male flies without a responding transgene was 48 days, and 40 days with the UAS-lacZ transgene. A partial rescue of this phenotype was observed with the expression of UAS-lacZ under paternal arm-Gal4 control, having an average median lifespan of 60 days. This data suggests that arm-Gal4 has detrimental effects on Drosophila development and lifespan that are directly dependent upon parental inheritance, and that the benign responder and reporter gene UAS-lacZ may influence D. melanogaster development. These findings should be taken into consideration during the design and execution of UAS-Gal4 expression experiments.",2015,"F A Slade, B E Staveley, F A Slade, B E Staveley"
Endocrine remodelling of the adult intestine sustains reproduction in Drosophila,26216039,10.7554/eLife.06930,"The production of offspring is energetically costly and relies on incompletely understood mechanisms that generate a positive energy balance. In mothers of many species, changes in key energy-associated internal organs are common yet poorly characterised functionally and mechanistically. In this study, we show that, in adult Drosophila females, the midgut is dramatically remodelled to enhance reproductive output. In contrast to extant models, organ remodelling does not occur in response to increased nutrient intake and/or offspring demands, but rather precedes them. With spatially and temporally directed manipulations, we identify juvenile hormone (JH) as an anticipatory endocrine signal released after mating. Acting through intestinal bHLH-PAS domain proteins Methoprene-tolerant (Met) and Germ cell-expressed (Gce), JH signals directly to intestinal progenitors to yield a larger organ, and adjusts gene expression and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activity in enterocytes to support increased lipid metabolism.

"Genomic and peptidomic analyses of the neuropeptides from the emerging pest, Drosophila suzukii",25158078,10.1016/j.peptides.2014.08.006,"Drosophila suzukii is a highly polyphagous invasive pest which has been recently introduced into Europe and North America, where it is causing severe economic losses through larval infestations of stone and berry fruits. The peptidome of the selected nervous tissues of adult D. suzukii was investigated as a first step in identifying potential targets for the development of novel insecticides. Through in silico analyses of the D. suzukii genome databases 28 neuropeptide families, comprising more than 70 predicted peptides were identified. Using a combination of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry of tissue extracts, 33 predicted peptides, representing 15 different peptide families were identified by their molecular masses and a total of 17 peptide sequences were confirmed by ion fragmentation. A comparison between the peptides and precursors of D. suzukii and D. melanogaster shows they are highly conserved, with differences only identified in the amino acid sequences of the peptides encoded in the FMRFamide, hugin and ecydysis triggering hormone precursors. All other peptides predicted and identified from D. suzukii appear to be identical to those previously characterized from D. melanogaster. Adipokinetic hormone was only identified in the corpus cardiacum, other peptides present included short neuropeptide F, a pyrokinin and myosuppressin, the latter of which was the only peptide identified from the crop nerve bundle. Peptides present in extracts of the brain and/or thoracico-abdominal ganglion included allatostatins, cardioacceleratory peptide 2b, corazonin, extended FMRFamides, pyrokinins, myoinihibitory peptides, neuropeptide-like precursor 1, SIFamide, short neuropeptide F, kinin, sulfakinins and tachykinin related peptides.",2015,"Neil Audsley, Rachel E Down, R Elwyn Isaac, Neil Audsley, Rachel E Down, R Elwyn Isaac"
G protein coupled receptors as targets for next generation pesticides,26226649,10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.07.014,"There is an on-going need for the discovery and development of new pesticides due to the loss of existing products through the continuing development of resistance, the desire for products with more favourable environmental and toxicological profiles and the need to implement the principles of integrated pest management. Insect G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) have important roles in modulating biology, physiology and behaviour, including reproduction, osmoregulation, growth and development. Modifying normal receptor function by blocking or over stimulating its actions may either result in the death of a pest or disrupt its normal fitness or reproductive capacity to reduce pest populations. Hence GPCRs offer potential targets for the development of next generation pesticides providing opportunities to discover new chemistries for invertebrate pest control. Such receptors are important targets for pharmaceutical drugs, but are under-exploited by the agro-chemical industry. The octopamine receptor agonists are the only pesticides with a recognized mode of action, as described in the classification scheme developed by the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee, that act via a GPCR. The availability of sequenced insect genomes has facilitated the characterization of insect GPCRs, but the development and utilization of screening assays to identify lead compounds has been slow. Various studies using knock-down technologies or applying the native ligands and/or neuropeptide analogues to pest insects in vivo, have however demonstrated that modifying normal receptor function can have an insecticidal effect. This review presents examples of potential insect neuropeptide receptors that are potential targets for lead compound development, using case studies from three representative pest species, Tribolium castaneum, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and Drosophila suzukii. Functional analysis studies on T. castaneum suggest that GPCRs involved in growth and development (eclosion hormone, ecdysis triggering hormone and crustacean cardioacceleratory peptide receptors) as well as the dopamine-2 like, latrophilin-like, starry night, frizzled-like, methuselah-like and the smoothened receptors may be suitable pesticide targets. From in vivo studies using native ligands and peptide analogues, receptors which appear to have a role in the regulation of feeding in the pea aphid, such as the PISCF-allatostatin and the various ""kinin"" receptors, are also potential targets. In Drosophila melanogaster various neuropeptides and their signalling pathways have been studied extensively. This may provide insights into potential pesticide targets that could be exploited in D. suzukii. Examples include the sex peptide receptor, which is involved in reproduction and host seeking behaviours, and those responsible for osmoregulation such as the diuretic hormone receptors. However the neuropeptides and their receptors in insects are often poorly characterized, especially in pest species. Although data from closely related species may be transferable (e.g. D. melanogaster to D. suzukii), peptides and receptors may have different roles in different insects, and hence a target in one insect may not be appropriate in another. Hence fundamental knowledge of the roles and functions of receptors is vital for development to proceed.",2015,"Neil Audsley, Rachel E Down, Neil Audsley, Rachel E Down"
dUTPase expression correlates with cell division potential in Drosophila melanogaster,25735890,10.1111/febs.13255,"dUTP pyrophosphatase (dUTPase) is a dNTP-sanitizing enzyme that prevents the appearance of potentially harmful uracil bases in DNA by hydrolyzing cellular dUTP. This function of dUTPase is found to be essential in many organisms including Drosophila melanogaster. Previously, we showed that the expression pattern of dUTPase determines the extent of uracil accumulation in the genome of different tissues. We wished to find the regulatory mechanism that eventually leaves a set of tissues with a uracil-free and intact genome. We found that the expression pattern established by the promoter of Drosophila dUTPase overlaps with mRNA and protein expression, excluding the involvement of other post-transcriptional contributions. This promoter was found to be active in primordial tissues, such as in the imaginal discs of larvae, in the larval brain and in reproductive organs. In the case of brain and imaginal tissues, we observed that the promoter activity depends on a DNA replication-related element motif, the docking site of DNA replication-related element binding factor, which is known as a transcriptional activator of genes involved in replication and proliferation. These results suggest that dUTPase expression is fine-tuned to meet the requirements of DNA synthesis in tissues where the maintenance of genome integrity is of high importance.",2015,"AndrÃ¡s HorvÃ¡th, JÃºlia Batki, LÃ¡szlÃ³ Henn, TamÃ¡s Lukacsovich, Gergely RÃ³na, MiklÃ³s ErdÃ©lyi, BeÃ¡ta G VÃ©rtessy, AndrÃ¡s HorvÃ¡th, JÃºlia Batki, LÃ¡szlÃ³ Henn, TamÃ¡s Lukacsovich, Gergely RÃ³na, MiklÃ³s ErdÃ©lyi, BeÃ¡ta G VÃ©rtessy"

We devised genetic approaches to define the anatomy of most of these hemilineages and to assessed their functional roles using the heat-sensitive channel dTRPA1. The simplest hemilineages contained local interneurons and their activation caused tonic or phasic leg movements lacking interlimb coordination. The next level was hemilineages of similar projection cells that drove intersegmentally coordinated behaviors such as walking. The highest level involved hemilineages whose activation elicited complex behaviors such as takeoff. These activation phenotypes indicate that the hemilineages vary in their behavioral roles with some contributing to local networks for sensorimotor processing and others having higher order functions of coordinating these local networks into complex behavior.",2015,"Robin M Harris, Barret D Pfeiffer, Gerald M Rubin, James W Truman, Robin M Harris, Barret D Pfeiffer, Gerald M Rubin, James W Truman"
Sex peptide receptor is required for the release of stored sperm by mated Drosophila melanogaster females,25783955,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2015.03.006,"The storage of sperm in mated females is important for efficient reproduction. After sperm are transferred to females during mating, they need to reach and enter into the site(s) of storage, be maintained viably within storage, and ultimately be released from storage to fertilize eggs. Perturbation of these events can have drastic consequences on fertility. In Drosophila melanogaster, females store sperm for up to 2 weeks after a single mating. For sperm to be released normally from storage, Drosophila females need to receive the seminal fluid protein (SFP) sex peptide (SP) during mating. SP, which binds to sperm in storage, signals through the sex peptide receptor (SPR) to elicit two other effects on mated females: the persistence of egg laying and a reduction in sexual receptivity. However, it is not known whether SPR is also needed to mediate SP's effect on sperm release. By phenotypic analysis of flies deleted for SPR, and of flies knocked down for SPR, ubiquitously or in specific tissues, we show that SPR is required to mediate SP's effects on sperm release from storage. We show that SPR expression in ppk(+) neurons is needed for proper sperm release; these neurons include those that mediate SP's effect on receptivity and egg laying. However, we find that SPR is also needed in the spermathecal secretory cells of the female reproductive tract for efficient sperm release. Thus, SPR expression is necessary in both the nervous system and in female reproductive tract cells to mediate the release of stored sperm.",2015,"Frank W Avila, Alexandra L Mattei, Mariana F Wolfner, Frank W Avila, Alexandra L Mattei, Mariana F Wolfner"

The wing-spot assay and the comet assay in larvae haemocytes were used, and the obtained results were compared with those obtained with the microparticulated form (silicon dioxide). All compounds were administered to third instar larvae at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10mM. No significant increases in the frequencies of mutant spots were observed in the wing-spot assay with any of the tested compounds. On the other hand, significant dose-dependent increases in the levels of primary DNA damage, measured by the comet assay, were observed for all the SAS evaluated but mainly when high doses (5 and 10mM) were used.

Olfactory specialization in Drosophila suzukii supports an ecological shift in host preference from rotten to fresh fruit,25618323,10.1007/s10886-015-0544-3,"It has been demonstrated that Drosophila suzukii is capable of attacking ripening fruit, making it a unique species within a fly family named for their attraction towards the fermentation products associated with rotten fruits, vinegar, and yeast. It also has been hypothesized that D. suzukii is more attracted to the volatiles associated with the earlier ripening stages of fruit development, and in turn, that D. suzukii is less attracted to fermented food resources, especially when compared with D. melanogaster. Here, we demonstrate that D. suzukii and its close relative D. biarmipes are in fact more sensitive to volatiles associated with the fruit-ripening process; however, in choice-assays, both spotted-wing species are more attracted to fermented fruit than to earlier stages of fruit development, which is similar to the behavioral preferences of D. melanogaster, and thus, fruit developmental stage alone does not explain the ecological niche observed for D. suzukii. In contrast, we show that both D. suzukii and D. biarmipes are more attracted to leaf odors than D. melanogaster in behavioral trials. For D. suzukii, this differential behavioral preference towards leaves appears to be linked to Î²-cyclocitral, a volatile isoprenoid that we show is most likely a novel ligand for the ""ab3A"" neuron.

The effects of folate intake on DNA and single-carbon pathway metabolism in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster compared to mammals,26219578,10.1016/j.cbpb.2015.07.007,"Mechanisms of vitamin function in non-mammals are poorly understood, despite being essential for development. Folate and cobalamin are B-vitamin cofactors with overlapping roles in transferring various single-carbon units. In mammals, one or both is needed for nucleotide synthesis, DNA methylation, amino acid conversions and other reactions. However, there has been little investigation of the response to folate or cobalamin in insects. Here, we manipulated folate intake and potentially cobalamin levels in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster with chemically-defined diets, an antibiotic to reduce bacterially-derived vitamins, and the folate-interfering pharmaceutical methotrexate, to see if single-carbon metabolites and DNA synthesis rates would be affected. We found that similar to mammals with low folate intake, fruit fly larvae had significantly slower growth and DNA synthesis rates. But changes to single carbon-metabolites did not mirror that of mammals with abnormal folate or given MTX. Five of the nine metabolites measured were not significantly affected (methionine, serine, glycine, methylglycine, and dimethylglycine) and three (cystathionine, methylgycine, and methylmalonic acid) were only decreased in larvae consuming methotrexate. Metabolites expected to be elevated if flies used cobalamin from microbial symbionts were not affected by dietary sulfaquinoxaline. Our data support the role of folate in nucleotide synthesis in D. melanogaster and that microbial symbionts provide functioning folates. We could not confirm how folate intake affects single carbon pathway metabolites, nor whether Drososphila use microbially-derived cobalamin. Further work should explore which cofactors are used in fruit flies in these important and potentially novel pathways.",2015,"Sydella A Blatch, Sally P Stabler, Jon F Harrison, Sydella A Blatch, Sally P Stabler, Jon F Harrison"

Postmating Circuitry Modulates Salt Taste Processing to Increase Reproductive Output in Drosophila,26412135,10.1016/j.cub.2015.08.043,"To optimize survival and reproduction, animals must match their nutrient intake to their current needs. Reproduction profoundly changes nutritional requirements, with many species showing an appetite for sodium during reproductive periods. How this internal state modifies neuronal information processing to ensure homeostasis is not understood. Here, we show that dietary sodium levels positively affect reproductive output in Drosophila melanogaster; to satisfy this requirement, females develop a strong, specific appetite for sodium following mating. We show that mating modulates gustatory processing to increase the probability of initiating feeding on salt. This postmating effect is not due to salt depletion by egg production, since abolishing egg production leaves the sodium appetite intact. Rather, the salt appetite is induced need-independently by male-derived Sex Peptide acting on the Sex Peptide Receptor in female reproductive tract neurons. We further demonstrate that postmating appetites for both salt and yeast are driven by the resultant silencing of downstream SAG neurons. Surprisingly, unlike the postmating yeast appetite, the salt appetite does not require octopamine, suggesting a divergence in the postmating circuitry. These findings demonstrate that the postmating circuit supports reproduction by increasing the palatability of specific nutrients. Such a feedforward regulation of sensory processing may represent a common mechanism through which reproductive state-sensitive circuits modify complex behaviors across species.",2015,"Samuel James Walker, VerÃ³nica MarÃ­a Corrales-Carvajal, Carlos Ribeiro, Samuel James Walker, VerÃ³nica MarÃ­a Corrales-Carvajal, Carlos Ribeiro"

Using an airborne exposure technique, three common and volatile oxylipins (1-octen-3-ol, (E)-2-hexenal, and 1-hexanol) were compared for their effects on spore germination and colony growth in Aspergillus niger and Penicillium chrysogenum, as well as for their effects on the morphogenesis of larvae of Drosophila melanogaster. Conidia of both A. niger and P. chrysogenum plated in the presence of low concentrations (50 ppm) of these three volatile organic compounds (VOCs) formed fewer colony-forming units (CFUs) and exhibited reduced radial growth of colonies as compared to controls. When A. niger and P. chrysogenum spores were germinated in the presence of the enantiomers of 1-octen-3-ol, (R)-(-)-1-octen-3-ol had the greatest impact on colony morphology (decreased sporulation and colony diameter), while (S)-(+)-1-octen-3-ol and the racemic form yielded similar morphological changes but to a lesser extent. In addition, Drosophila larvae exposed to vapors of these oxylipins exhibited serious delays in metamorphosis and toxic effects on pupae and adult stages. Low concentration of these three VOCs can significantly inhibit the formation of CFUs and the growth of fungi. (R)-(-)-1-octen-3-ol imposed the greatest impact on fungal morphology compared to (S)-(+)-1-octen-3-ol and the racemic form.

The effects of sex-biased gene expression and X-linkage on rates of adaptive protein sequence evolution in Drosophila,25926696,10.1098/rsbl.2015.0117,"A faster rate of adaptive evolution of X-linked genes compared with autosomal genes may be caused by the fixation of new recessive or partially recessive advantageous mutations (the Faster-X effect). This effect is expected to be largest for mutations that affect only male fitness and absent for mutations that affect only female fitness. We tested these predictions in Drosophila melanogaster by using genes with different levels of sex-biased expression and by estimating the extent of adaptive evolution of non-synonymous mutations from polymorphism and divergence data. We detected both a Faster-X effect and an effect of male-biased gene expression. There was no evidence for a strong association between the two effects--modest levels of male-biased gene expression increased the rate of adaptive evolution on both the autosomes and the X chromosome, but a Faster-X effect occurred for both unbiased genes and female-biased genes. The rate of genetic recombination did not influence the magnitude of the Faster-X effect, ruling out the possibility that it reflects less Hill-Robertson interference for X-linked genes.",2015,"Victoria ?vila, JosÃ© L Campos, Brian Charlesworth, Victoria ?vila, JosÃ© L Campos, Brian Charlesworth"
Mechanism of the fluorescent light induced suppression of Curly phenotype in Drosophila melanogaster,11536279,10.1002/bem.65,"A dominant mutation Curly (Cy), frequently used as a marker on the second chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster, was previously shown to be suppressed by several factors, including larval crowding, low temperature, and fluorescent light. While the first two factors affect this mutation only partially, fluorescent tube exposed flies exhibit an almost completely suppressed (wild type) phenotype. This suppressive effect is the result of a combination of the electric field and light, both factors being produced by common fluorescent tubes. In this study, experiments were carried out to clarify the basic mechanism of this unique phenomenon. Two fluorescent tube sensitive stages of Drosophila development were found in the second half of embryonic development and first half of the pupal stage. Riboflavin, which is administered to Drosophila larvae with yeast, and decomposed by light, seems to play a key role in this phenomenon. In a medium lacking riboflavin caused by light exposure, Cy expression is inhibited by the action of electric field. Positive results of experiments with lithium ions, which block the opening of Ca(2+) channels, support the hypothesis that electromagnetic fields may alter ion currents during ontogenic development of Drosophila, and thus influence, expression of the Cy gene.

Comparison of coding regions, introns and intergenic sequences in five Dipteran species, D. melanogaster, D. subobscura, D. virilis, D. grimshawi and C. capitata documented an extensive divergence in introns and coding regions, but few well conserved elements in the proximal 5' flanking regions in all species. These elements are related to conserved regulatory features of three of the genes, including tissue- and temporal regulation. In the fourth, gene s15, significant alterations in the 5' flanking region may be responsible for its changed temporal regulation in C. capitata. One long intergenic sequence, located in the distal 5' flanking region of gene s18, is homologous to ACE3, a major amplification control element and contains an 80-bp A/T-rich sequence, known to stimulate strong binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC) in D. melanogaster.

In silico identification of novel selenoproteins in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,11493597,10.1093/embo-reports/kve151,"In selenoproteins, incorporation of the amino acid selenocysteine is specified by the UGA codon, usually a stop signal. The alternative decoding of UGA is conferred by an mRNA structure, the SECIS element, located in the 3'-untranslated region of the selenoprotein mRNA. Because of the non-standard use of the UGA codon, current computational gene prediction methods are unable to identify selenoproteins in the sequence of the eukaryotic genomes. Here we describe a method to predict selenoproteins in genomic sequences, which relies on the prediction of SECIS elements in coordination with the prediction of genes in which the strong codon bias characteristic of protein coding regions extends beyond a TGA codon interrupting the open reading frame. We applied the method to the Drosophila melanogaster genome, and predicted four potential selenoprotein genes. One of them belongs to a known family of selenoproteins, and we have tested experimentally two other predictions with positive results.

Changes in thermotolerance and Hsp70 expression with domestication in Drosophila melanogaster,29280581,10.1046/j.1420-9101.2001.00256.x,"To examine how the duration of laboratory domestication may affect Drosophila stocks used in studies of thermotolerance, we measured expression of the inducible heat-shock protein Hsp70 and survival after heat shock in D. melanogaster strains recently collected from nature and maintained in laboratory culture for up to 50 or more generations. After an initial increase in both Hsp70 expression and thermotolerance immediately after transfer to laboratory medium, both traits remained fairly constant over time and variation among strains persisted through laboratory domestication. Furthermore, variation in heat tolerance and Hsp70 expression did not correlate with the length of time populations evolved in the laboratory. Therefore, while environmental variation likely contributed most to early shifts in strain tolerance and Hsp70 expression, other population parameters, for example genetic drift, inbreeding, and selection likely affected these traits little. As long as populations are maintained with large numbers of individuals, the culture of insects in the laboratory may have little effect on the tolerance of different strains to thermal stress.",2001,"R A Krebs, S P Roberts, B R Bettencourt, M E Feder, R A Krebs, S P Roberts, B R Bettencourt, M E Feder"
Pyrokinin/PBAN-like peptides in the central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster,11735047,10.1007/s00441-001-0467-x,"The pyrokinin/pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) family of peptides found in insects is characterized by a 5-amino-acid C-terminal sequence, FXPRLamide. The pentapeptide is the active core required for diverse physiological functions, including stimulation of pheromone biosynthesis in female moths, stimulation of muscle contraction, induction of embryonic diapause in Bombyx mori, and stimulation of melanization in some larval moths. Recently, this family of peptides has been implicated in accelerating the formation of the puparium in a dipteran. Using bioassay and immunocytochemical techniques, we demonstrate the presence of pyrokinin/PBAN-like peptides in the central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster. Pheromonotropic activity was shown in the moths Helicoverpa zeaand Helicoverpa armigera by using dissected larval nervous systems and adult heads and bodies of D. melanogaster. Polyclonal antisera against the C-terminal ending of PBAN revealed the location of cell bodies and axons in the central nervous systems of larval and adult flies. Immunoreactive material was detected in at least three groups of neurons in the subesophageal ganglion of 3rd instar larvae, pupae, and adults. The ring gland of both larvae and adults contained immunoreactivity. Adult brain-subesophageal ganglion complex possessed additional neurons. The fused ventral ganglia of both larvae and adults contained three pairs of neurons that sent their axons to a neurohemal organ connected to the abdominal nervous system.

Molecular components of the circadian system in Drosophila,11181974,10.1146/annurev.physiol.63.1.729,"Much of our current understanding of how circadian rhythms are generated is based on work done with Drosophila melanogaster. Molecular mechanisms used to assemble an endogenous clock in this organism are now known to underlie circadian rhythms in many other species, including mammals. The genetic amenability of Drosophila has led to the identification of some genes that encode components of the clock (so-called clock genes) and others that either link the clock to the environment or act downstream of it. The clock provides time-of-day cues by regulating levels of specific gene products such that they oscillate with a circadian rhythm. The mechanisms that synchronize these oscillations to light are understood to some extent. However, there are still large gaps in our knowledge, in particular with respect to the mechanisms used by the clock to control overt rhythms. It has, however, become clear that in addition to the brain clock, autonomous or semi-autonomous clocks occur in peripheral tissues where they confer circadian regulation on specific functions.",2001,"J A Williams, A Sehgal, J A Williams, A Sehgal"

The pericentromeric chiasmata between homologs or (in the absence of the latter) chromocentric links between nonhomologs, which are preserved until prometaphase, compensate for the disturbed binding between homologous pericentromeric regions in both structural or locus mutants. When the links between nonhomologs are involved, interchromosomal effects on chromosome disjunction and nonhomologous pairing were revealed by the genetic methods. An explanation suggested for genetic events observed during Drosophila meiosis conforms with the original, cytogenetically proved model of the orderly two-ring chromocenter formation and reorganization.",2001,"V L Chubykin, V L Chubykin"
How malleable is the eukaryotic genome? Extreme rate of chromosomal rearrangement in the genus Drosophila,11157786,10.1101/gr.162901,"During the evolution of the genus Drosophila, the molecular organization of the major chromosomal elements has been repeatedly rearranged via the fixation of paracentric inversions. Little detailed information is available, however, on the extent and effect of these changes at the molecular level. In principle, a full description of the rate and pattern of change could reveal the limits, if any, to which the eukaryotic genome can accommodate reorganizations. We have constructed a high-density physical map of the largest chromosomal element in Drosophila repleta (chromosome 2) and compared the order and distances between the markers with those on the homologous chromosomal element (3R) in Drosophila melanogaster. The two species belong to different subgenera (Drosophila and Sophophora, respectively), which diverged 40-62 million years (Myr) ago and represent, thus, the farthest lineages within the Drosophila genus. The comparison reveals extensive reshuffling of gene order from centromere to telomere. Using a maximum likelihood method, we estimate that 114 +/- 14 paracentric inversions have been fixed in this chromosomal element since the divergence of the two species, that is, 0.9-1.4 inversions fixed per Myr. Comparison with available rates of chromosomal evolution, taking into account genome size, indicates that the Drosophila genome shows the highest rate found so far in any eukaryote. Twenty-one small segments (23-599 kb) comprising at least two independent (nonoverlapping) markers appear to be conserved between D. melanogaster and D. repleta. These results are consistent with the random breakage model and do not provide significant evidence of functional constraint of any kind. They support the notion that the Drosophila genome is extraordinarily malleable and has a modular organization. The high rate of chromosomal change also suggests a very limited transferability of the positional information from the Drosophila genome to other insects.",2001,"J M Ranz, F Casals, A Ruiz, J M Ranz, F Casals, A Ruiz"
Sequences homologous to the hobo transposable element in E strains of Drosophila melanogaster,11470844,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003939,"Hobo is one of the three Drosophila melanogaster transposable elements, together with the P and I elements, that seem to have recently invaded the genome of this species. Surveys of the presence of hobo in strains from different geographical and temporal origins have shown that recently collected strains contain complete and deleted elements with high sequence similarity (H strains), but old strains lack hobo elements (E strains). Besides the canonical hobo sequences, both H and E strains show other poorly known hobo-related sequences. In the present work, we analyze the presence, cytogenetic location, and structure of some of these sequences in E strains of D. melanogaster. By in situ hybridization, we found that euchromatic hobo-related sequences were in fixed positions in all six E strains analyzed: 38C in the 2L arm; 42B and 55A in the 2R arm; 79E and 80B in the 3L arm; and 82C, 84C, and 84D in the 3R arm. Sequence comparison shows that some of the hobo-related sequences from Oregon-R and iso-1 strains are similar to the canonical hobo element, but their analysis reveals that they are substantially diverged and rearranged and cannot code for a functional transposase. Our results suggest that these ubiquitous hobo-homologous sequences are immobile and are distantly related to the modern hobo elements from D. melanogaster.",2001,"M I Galindo, Y Bigot, M D SÃ¡nchez, G Periquet, L Pascual, M I Galindo, Y Bigot, M D SÃ¡nchez, G Periquet, L Pascual"
The drosophila aeroplane mutant is caused by an I-element insertion into a tissue-specific teashirt enhancer motif,11681617,10.1139/g01-077,"In Drosophila melanogaster, aeroplane (ae) is a regulatory allele of teashirt (tsh), and the mutant wing posture phenotype of homozygous ae flies is caused by a defect in the hinge region of the wing, whereby the base of the wing at the proximal ventral radius is fused to the thorax in the region of the pleural wing process. The apparent paralysis of the wings and the drooping halteres are caused by an I-element insertion into a 3' noncoding sequence of tsh. The cis-acting regulatory element interrupted by the I element is required, to drive tsh expression in the regions of the developing adult that give rise to proximal wing and haltere tissues. Loss of this expression results in the fusion of the proximal structures of the wing and halteres to the thoracic cuticle. Further characterization of this tsh regulatory motif has now identified an additional enhancer activity directing tsh expression in tissues forming portions of the midgut. Subdivision of this midgut enhancer activity has identified putative negatively acting motifs.",2001,"K H Soanes, J B Bell, K H Soanes, J B Bell"
"The acetylcholinesterase gene and organophosphorus resistance in the Australian sheep blowfly, Lucilia cuprina",11378416,10.1016/s0965-1748(00)00186-7,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), encoded by the Ace gene, is the primary target of organophosphorous (OP) and carbamate insecticides. Ace mutations have been identified in OP resistants strains of Drosophila melanogaster. However, in the Australian sheep blowfly, Lucilia cuprina, resistance in field and laboratory generated strains is determined by point mutations in the Rop-1 gene, which encodes a carboxylesterase, E3. To investigate the apparent bias for the Rop-1/E3 mechanism in the evolution of OP resistance in L. cuprina, we have cloned the Ace gene from this species and characterized its product. Southern hybridization indicates the existence of a single Ace gene in L. cuprina. The amino acid sequence of L. cuprina AChE shares 85.3% identity with D. melanogaster and 92.4% with Musca domestica AChE. Five point mutations in Ace associated with reduced sensitivity to OP insecticides have been previously detected in resistant strains of D. melanogaster. These residues are identical in susceptible strains of D. melanogaster and L. cuprina, although different codons are used. Each of the amino acid substitutions that confer OP resistance in D. melanogaster could also occur in L. cuprina by a single non-synonymous substitution. These data suggest that the resistance mechanism used in L. cuprina is determined by factors other than codon bias. The same point mutations, singly and in combination, were introduced into the Ace gene of L. cuprina by site-directed mutagenesis and the resulting AChE enzymes expressed using a baculovirus system to characterise their kinetic properties and interactions with OP insecticides. The K(m) of wild type AChE for acetylthiocholine (ASCh) is 23.13 microM and the point mutations change the affinity to the substrate. The turnover number of Lucilia AChE for ASCh was estimated to be 1.27x10(3) min(-1), similar to Drosophila or housefly AChE. The single amino acid replacements reduce the affinities of the AChE for OPs and give up to 8.7-fold OP insensitivity, while combined mutations give up to 35-fold insensitivity. However, other published studies indicate these same mutations yield higher levels of OP insensitivity in D. melanogaster and A. aegypti. The inhibition data indicate that the wild type form of AChE of L. cuprina is 12.4-fold less sensitive to OP inhibition than the susceptible form of E3, suggesting that the carboxylesterases may have a role in the protection of AChE via a sequestration mechanism. This provides a possible explanation for the bias towards the evolution of resistance via the Rop-1/E3 mechanism in L. cuprina.",2001,"Z Chen, R Newcomb, E Forbes, J McKenzie, P Batterham, Z Chen, R Newcomb, E Forbes, J McKenzie, P Batterham"

We test the hypothesis that resistance to environmental stresses is lost under laboratory adaptation. For both traits, there was a rapid loss of resistance over a three-year period. The rapidity of the response suggested that mutation accumulation could not account for it. Rather, resistance to environmental stresses appeared to be lost as a correlated response to selection on another trait, such as early fertility, with which stress resistance is negatively genetically correlated. These results suggest that caution is needed when extrapolating from evolution of stress resistance in long-established laboratory stocks to patterns of responses and correlated responses in natural populations.",2001,"A A Hoffmann, R Hallas, C Sinclair, L Partridge, A A Hoffmann, R Hallas, C Sinclair, L Partridge"
Local changes in GC/AT substitution biases and in crossover frequencies on Drosophila chromosomes,11264413,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003841,"I present here evidence of remarkable local changes in GC/AT substitution biases and in crossover frequencies on Drosophila chromosomes. The substitution pattern at 10 loci in the telomeric region of the X chromosome was studied for four species of the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup. Drosophila orena and Drosophila erecta are clearly the most closely related species pair (the erecta complex) among the four species studied; however, the overall data at the 10 loci revealed a clear dichotomy in the silent substitution patterns between the AT-biased- substitution melanogaster and erecta lineages and the GC-biased-substitution yakuba and orena lineages, suggesting two or more independent changes in GC/AT substitution biases. More importantly, the results indicated a between- loci heterogeneity in GC/AT substitution bias in this small region independently in the yakuba and orena lineages. Indeed, silent substitutions in the orena lineage were significantly biased toward G and C at the consecutive yellow, lethal of scute, and asense loci, but they were significantly biased toward A and T at sta. The substitution bias toward G and C was centered in different areas in yakuba (significantly biased at EG:165H7.3, EG:171D11.2, and suppressor of sable). The similar silent substitution patterns in coding and noncoding regions, furthermore, suggested mutational biases as a cause of the substitution biases. On the other hand, previous study reveals that Drosophila yakuba has about 20-fold higher crossover frequencies in the telomeric region of the X chromosome than does D. melanogaster; this study revealed that the total genetic map length of the yakuba X chromosome was only about 1.5 times as large as that of melanogaster and that the map length of the X-telomeric y-sta region did not differ between Drosophila yakuba and D. erecta. Taken together, the data strongly suggested that an approximately 20- fold reduction in the X-telomeric crossover frequencies occurred in the ancestral population of D. melanogaster after the melanogaster-yakuba divergence but before the melanogaster-simulans divergence.",2001,"T Takano-Shimizu, T Takano-Shimizu"
Molecular regulation of circadian rhythms in Drosophila and mammals,11765127,10.1177/107385840100700606,"Through the use of genetically amenable model systems, we have begun to form a relatively clear idea as to the molecular mechanisms that constitute a functioning circadian clock. It is now known that mechanisms that underlie overt rhythms are conserved across species. At the basic core of the clock lies a transcriptional/translational feedback loop. The primary components of this loop are called clock genes and are similar for the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and mammalian systems. However, many questions regarding their regulation remain unanswered. In addition to their localization in brain areas associated with pacemaking function, clock genes are also found in peripheral tissues where their presence may confer circadian regulation upon local, tissue-specific functions. The light-dark cycle is the primary environmental stimulus for the synchronization of the circadian clock. In Drosophila, light is known to induce the degradation of a clock component resulting in the synchronization of the core clock mechanism. Photic signals are transmitted to the clock, at least in part, by the blue light photoreceptor cryptochrome. Although expression of several mammalian clock gene products is also altered in response to light, the photoreceptor(s) involved have not yet been defined.",2001,"E L Meyer-Bernstein, A Sehgal, E L Meyer-Bernstein, A Sehgal"

Linear chromosomal ends appear to be essential for fusions to take place. These fusions do not resolve, leading to cycles of chromosomal breakage and rejoining and severe genome rearrangements.

Their appearance makes these regions difficult to map. The Su(UR)ES gene, which controls the phenomenon, has been described recently. Mutation of this locus gives rise to new blocks of material in the pericentric heterochromatic regions and causes the disappearance of breaks and ectopic contacts in the intercalary heterochromatic regions, thereby making the banding pattern distinct and providing better opportunities for mapping of the heterochromatic regions in polytene chromosomes. Here, we present the results of an electron microscope study of the heterochromatic regions. In the wild-type salivary glands, the pericentric regions correspond to the beta-heterochromatin and do not show the banding pattern. The most conspicuous cytological effect of the Su(UR)ES mutation is the formation of a large banded chromosome fragment comprising at least 25 bands at the site where the 3L and 3R proximal arms connect. In the other pericentric regions, 20CF, 40BF and 41BC, 15, 12 and 9 new bands were revealed, respectively. A large block of densely packed material appears in the most proximal part of the fourth chromosome.

The production of elevated flight force compromises manoeuvrability in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,11171345,,"In this study, we have investigated how enhanced total flight force production compromises steering performance in tethered flying fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster. The animals were flown in a closed-loop virtual-reality flight arena in which they modulated total flight force production in response to vertically oscillating visual patterns. By simultaneously measuring stroke amplitude and stroke frequency, we recorded the ability of each fly to modulate its wing kinematics at different levels of aerodynamic force production. At a flight force that exactly compensates body weight, the temporal deviations with which fruit flies vary their stroke amplitude and frequency are approximately 2.7 degrees and 4.8 Hz of their mean value, respectively. This variance in wing kinematics decreases with increasing flight force production, and at maximum force production fruit flies are restricted to a unique combination of stroke amplitude, stroke frequency and mean force coefficient. This collapse in the kinematic envelope during peak force production could greatly attenuate the manoeuvrability and stability of animals in free flight.",2001,"F O Lehmann, M H Dickinson, F O Lehmann, M H Dickinson"

Here we show that the ventral appendage that forms in the absence of selector gene activity is leglike but consists of only two segments along its proximo-distal axis: a proximal segment and a distal tarsus.

Effective treatment necessitates the identification of factors influencing alcohol toxicity with aging. We investigated the interaction between aging, alcohol toxicity and circadian function using Drosophila as a model system. We found as wild type flies age, sensitivity to alcohol increases and circadian regulation of alcohol-induced behaviors weakens. Decreased circadian modulation is correlated with significantly greater alcohol sensitivity during the subjective day. The circadian clock modulates alcohol-induced mortality in younger flies with increased mortality following alcohol exposure at night. Older flies exhibit significantly longer recovery times following alcohol-induced sedation and increased mortality following binge-like or chronic alcohol exposure. Flies rendered arrhythmic either genetically or environmentally exhibit significantly increased alcohol sensitivity, longer recovery times and increased mortality.

FLPing Genes On and Off in Drosophila,28815502,10.1007/978-1-4939-7169-5_13,"The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has been a favorite experimental system of developmental biologists for more than a century. One of the most attractive features of this model system is the clarity by which one can analyze mutant phenotypes. Most genes are found in single copies, and loss-of-function mutants often have obvious phenotypes that can be analyzed during development and in adulthood. As with all metazoans, a significant fraction of Drosophila genes are used during both embryonic and postembryonic development, and null mutants often die during embryogenesis thereby precluding the analysis of postembryonic tissues. For several decades researchers worked around this problem by either studying gynandromorphs or irradiating chromosomes carrying mutations in the hope of inducing mitotic recombination which would then allow for the analysis of mutant phenotypes in smaller populations of cells. The former method suffers from the fact that mutations in the gene of interest are often lethal when generated in large sectors, which is a hallmark of gynandromorphs. Clonal induction with the latter method occurs at relatively low frequencies making this method laborious. The introduction of the yeast FRT System/FRT site-directed recombination system to Drosophila has made generating loss-of-function mosaic clones simple and easy. Over the years several variants of this method have allowed developmental biologists to remove genes, overexpress genes, and even express one gene in patches of cells that are mutant for a second gene. In this review we will briefly discuss some of various FRT System/FRT-based approaches that are being used to manipulate gene expression in Drosophila. The individual FRT System/FRT-based methods are described in the papers that are cited herein.

We have generated knockout and knockin lines for Trh, the 5-HT synthesizing enzyme and all five 5-HT receptors, making it possible for us to determine their expression patterns and to investigate their functional roles. Loss of the Trh, 5HT1a or 5HT2b gene decreased sleep time whereas loss of the Trh or 5HT2b gene diminished sleep rebound after sleep deprivation. 5HT2b expression in a small subset of, probably a single pair of, neurons in the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) is functionally essential: elimination of the 5HT2b gene from these neurons led to loss of sleep homeostasis. Genetic ablation of 5HT2b neurons in the dFB decreased sleep and impaired sleep homeostasis. Our results have shown that serotonergic signaling in specific neurons is required for the regulation of sleep homeostasis.",2017,"Yongjun Qian, Yue Cao, Bowen Deng, Guang Yang, Jiayun Li, Rui Xu, Dandan Zhang, Juan Huang, Yi Rao, Yongjun Qian, Yue Cao, Bowen Deng, Guang Yang, Jiayun Li, Rui Xu, Dandan Zhang, Juan Huang, Yi Rao"
Genomic responses to the socio-sexual environment in male Drosophila melanogaster exposed to conspecific rivals,28428330,10.1261/rna.059246.116,"Socio-sexual environments have profound effects on fitness. Local sex ratios can alter the threat of sexual competition, to which males respond via plasticity in reproductive behaviors and ejaculate composition. In Drosophila melanogaster, males detect the presence of conspecific, same-sex mating rivals prior to mating using multiple, redundant sensory cues. Males that respond to rivals gain significant fitness benefits by altering mating duration and ejaculate composition. Here we investigated the underlying genome-wide changes involved. We used RNA-seq to analyze male transcriptomic responses 2, 26, and 50 h after exposure to rivals, a time period that was previously identified as encompassing the major facets of male responses to rivals. The results showed a strong early activation of multiple sensory genes in the head-thorax (HT), prior to the expression of any phenotypic differences. This gene expression response was reduced by 26 h, at the time of maximum phenotypic change, and shut off by 50 h. In the abdomen (A), fewer genes changed in expression and gene expression responses appeared to increase over time. The results also suggested that different sets of functionally equivalent genes might be activated in different replicates. This could represent a mechanism by which robustness is conferred upon highly plastic traits. Overall, our study reveals that mRNA-seq can identify subtle genomic signatures characteristic of flexible behavioral phenotypes.",2017,"Irina Mohorianu, Amanda Bretman, Damian T Smith, Emily K Fowler, Tamas Dalmay, Tracey Chapman, Irina Mohorianu, Amanda Bretman, Damian T Smith, Emily K Fowler, Tamas Dalmay, Tracey Chapman"

Atrophin controls developmental signaling pathways via interactions with Trithorax-like,28327288,10.7554/eLife.23084,"Mutations in human Atrophin1, a transcriptional corepressor, cause dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, a neurodegenerative disease. Drosophila Atrophin (Atro) mutants display many phenotypes, including neurodegeneration, segmentation, patterning and planar polarity defects. Despite Atro's critical role in development and disease, relatively little is known about Atro's binding partners and downstream targets. We present the first genomic analysis of Atro using ChIP-seq against endogenous Atro. ChIP-seq identified 1300 potential direct targets of Atro including engrailed, and components of the Dpp and Notch signaling pathways. We show that Atro regulates Dpp and Notch signaling in larval imaginal discs, at least partially via regulation of thickveins and fringe. In addition, bioinformatics analyses, sequential ChIP and coimmunoprecipitation experiments reveal that Atro interacts with the Drosophila GAGA Factor, Trithorax-like (Trl), and they bind to the same loci simultaneously. Phenotypic analyses of Trl and Atro clones suggest that Atro is required to modulate the transcription activation by Trl in larval imaginal discs.

Induction and Diagnosis of Tumors in Drosophila Imaginal Disc Epithelia,28784954,10.3791/55901,"In the early stages of cancer, transformed mutant cells show cytological abnormalities, begin uncontrolled overgrowth, and progressively disrupt tissue organization. Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a popular experimental model system in cancer biology to study the genetic and cellular mechanisms of tumorigenesis. In particular, genetic tools for Drosophila imaginal discs (developing epithelia in larvae) enable the creation of transformed pro-tumor cells within a normal epithelial tissue, a situation similar to the initial stages of human cancer. A recent study of tumorigenesis in Drosophila wing imaginal discs, however, showed that tumor initiation depends on the tissue-intrinsic cytoarchitecture and the local microenvironment, suggesting that it is important to consider the region-specific susceptibility to tumorigenic stimuli in evaluating tumor phenotypes in imaginal discs. To facilitate phenotypic analysis of tumor progression in imaginal discs, here we describe a protocol for genetic experiments using the GAL4-UAS system to induce neoplastic tumors in wing imaginal discs. We further introduce a diagnosis method to classify the phenotypes of clonal lesions induced in imaginal epithelia, as a clear classification method to discriminate various stages of tumor progression (such as hyperplasia, dysplasia, or neoplasia) had not been described before. These methods might be broadly applicable to the clonal analysis of tumor phenotypes in various organs in Drosophila.",2017,"Kenta Morimoto, Yoichiro Tamori, Kenta Morimoto, Yoichiro Tamori"
Maternal loading of a small heat shock protein increases embryo thermal tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster,29097593,10.1242/jeb.164848,"Maternal investment is likely to have direct effects on offspring survival. In oviparous animals whose embryos are exposed to the external environment, maternal provisioning of molecular factors like mRNAs and proteins may help embryos cope with sudden changes in the environment. Here, we sought to modify the maternal mRNA contribution to offspring embryos and test for maternal effects on acute thermal tolerance in early embryos of Drosophila melanogaster We drove in vivo overexpression of a small heat shock protein gene (Hsp23) in female ovaries and measured the effects of acute thermal stress on offspring embryonic survival and larval development. We report that overexpression of the Hsp23 gene in female ovaries produced offspring embryos with increased thermal tolerance. We also found that brief heat stress in the early embryonic stage (0-1 h old) caused decreased larval performance later in life (5-10 days old), as indexed by pupation height. Maternal overexpression of Hsp23 protected embryos against this heat-induced defect in larval performance. Our data demonstrate that transient products of single genes have large and lasting effects on whole-organism environmental tolerance. Further, our results suggest that maternal effects have a profound impact on offspring survival in the context of thermal variability.",2017,"Brent L Lockwood, Cole R Julick, Kristi L Montooth, Brent L Lockwood, Cole R Julick, Kristi L Montooth"
Growth and size control during development,29142108,10.1098/rsob.170190,"The size and shape of organs are characteristic for each species. Even when organisms develop to different sizes due to varying environmental conditions, such as nutrition, organ size follows species-specific rules of proportionality to the rest of the body, a phenomenon referred to as allometry. Therefore, for a given environment, organs stop growth at a predictable size set by the species's genotype. How do organs stop growth? How can related species give rise to organs of strikingly different size? No definitive answer has been given to date. One of the major models for the studies of growth termination is the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. Therefore, this review will focus mostly on work carried out in Drosophila to try to tease apart potential mechanisms and identify routes for further investigation. One general rule, found across the animal kingdom, is that the rate of growth declines with developmental time. Therefore, answers to the problem of growth termination should explain this seemingly universal fact. In addition, growth termination is intimately related to the problems of robustness (i.e. precision) and plasticity in organ size, symmetric and asymmetric organ development, and of how the 'target' size depends on extrinsic, environmental factors.",2017,"Jannik Vollmer, Fernando Casares, Dagmar Iber, Jannik Vollmer, Fernando Casares, Dagmar Iber"
Faithful mRNA splicing depends on the Prp19 complex subunit faint sausage and is required for tracheal branching morphogenesis in Drosophila,28087625,10.1242/dev.144535,"Morphogenesis requires the dynamic regulation of gene expression, including transcription, mRNA maturation and translation. Dysfunction of the general mRNA splicing machinery can cause surprisingly specific cellular phenotypes, but the basis for these effects is not clear. Here, we show that the Drosophila faint sausage (fas) locus, which is implicated in epithelial morphogenesis and has previously been reported to encode a secreted immunoglobulin domain protein, in fact encodes a subunit of the spliceosome-activating Prp19 complex, which is essential for efficient pre-mRNA splicing. Loss of zygotic fas function globally impairs the efficiency of splicing, and is associated with widespread retention of introns in mRNAs and dramatic changes in gene expression. Surprisingly, despite these general effects, zygotic fas mutants show specific defects in tracheal cell migration during mid-embryogenesis when maternally supplied splicing factors have declined. We propose that tracheal branching, which relies on dynamic changes in gene expression, is particularly sensitive for efficient spliceosome function. Our results reveal an entry point to study requirements of the splicing machinery during organogenesis and provide a better understanding of disease phenotypes associated with mutations in general splicing factors.",2017,"Julia Sauerwald, Charlotte Soneson, Mark D Robinson, Stefan Luschnig, Julia Sauerwald, Charlotte Soneson, Mark D Robinson, Stefan Luschnig"

By applying a combined strategy of linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing in the presented family, a homozygous nonsense mutation, c.4G>T (p.Glu2*), in FITM2 was identified. FITM2 and its paralog FITM1 constitute an evolutionary conserved protein family involved in partitioning of triglycerides into cellular lipid droplets. Despite the role of FITM2 in neutral lipid storage and metabolism, no indications for lipodystrophy were observed in the affected individuals. In order to obtain independent evidence for the involvement of FITM2 in the human pathology, downregulation of the single Fitm ortholog, CG10671, in Drosophila melanogaster was pursued using RNA interference. Characteristics of the syndrome, including progressive locomotor impairment, hearing loss and disturbed sensory functions, were recapitulated in Drosophila, which supports the causative nature of the FITM2 mutation.

Resistance evolution in Drosophila: the case of CYP6G1,27787942,10.1002/ps.4470,"The massive use of DDT as an insecticide between 1940 and 1970 has resulted in the emergence of a resistant population of insects.

The P450 Cyp6g1 was identified as the major factor responsible for DDT resistance in Drosophila melanogaster field populations. In this article, we review the data available for this gene since it was associated with resistance in 2002.

Ataxin 2-binding protein 1 is a context-specific positive regulator of Notch signaling during neurogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,28174239,10.1242/dev.140657,"The role of the Notch pathway during the lateral inhibition that underlies binary cell fate choice is extensively studied, but the context specificity that generates diverse outcomes is less well understood. In the peripheral nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster, differential Notch signaling between cells of the proneural cluster orchestrates sensory organ specification. Here we report functional analysis of Drosophila Ataxin 2-binding protein 1 (A2BP1) during this process. Its human ortholog is linked to type 2 spinocerebellar ataxia and other complex neuronal disorders. Downregulation of Drosophila A2BP1 in the proneural cluster increases adult sensory bristle number, whereas its overexpression results in loss of bristles. We show that A2BP1 regulates sensory organ specification by potentiating Notch signaling. Supporting its direct involvement, biochemical analysis shows that A2BP1 is part of the Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] complex in the presence and absence of Notch. However, in the absence of Notch signaling, the A2BP1 interacting fraction of Su(H) does not associate with the repressor proteins Groucho and CtBP. We propose a model explaining the requirement of A2BP1 as a positive regulator of context-specific Notch activity.",2017,"Jay Prakash Shukla, Girish Deshpande, L S Shashidhara, Jay Prakash Shukla, Girish Deshpande, L S Shashidhara"

Furthermore, we found that 21 of these miRNAs were potentially involved in the regulation of Imd pathway-related genes. Strikingly, based on UAS-miRNAs line screening and Dual-luciferase assay, we identified that miR-9a and miR-981 could both negatively regulate Drosophila antibacterial defenses and decrease the level of the antibacterial peptide, Diptericin.

Here, we describe in detail the properties of a previously unexplored trait in Drosophila melanogaster that shares many salient properties with human height. The total length of the pupal case varies between 2.8 and 3.9 mm among natural variants, and we report that it is among the most heritable traits reported in this species. We have developed a simple semiautomatic phenotyping system with which a single operator can reliably score >5000 individuals in a day. The precision of the automated system is 0.042 mm (Â± 0.030 SD). All phenotyped individuals are available to be mated in subsequent generations or uniquely archived for future molecular work.

Recombination rate plasticity: revealing mechanisms by design,29109222,10.1098/rstb.2016.0459,"For over a century, scientists have known that meiotic recombination rates can vary considerably among individuals, and that environmental conditions can modify recombination rates relative to the background.

Further, many questions remain regarding the mechanisms and molecular processes that contribute to recombination rate plasticity.

We synthesize lessons learned from this model system into experimental guidelines for using recent advances in genotyping technologies, to study recombination rate plasticity in non-model organisms.

Natural Selection Drives Rapid Functional Evolution of Young Drosophila Duplicate Genes,28961791,10.1093/molbev/msx230,"Gene duplication is thought to play a major role in phenotypic evolution. Yet the forces involved in the functional divergence of young duplicate genes remain unclear. Here, we use population-genetic inference to elucidate the role of natural selection in the functional evolution of young duplicate genes in Drosophila melanogaster. We find that negative selection acts on young duplicates with ancestral functions, and positive selection on those with novel functions, suggesting that natural selection may determine whether and how young duplicate genes are retained. Moreover, evidence of natural selection is strongest in protein-coding regions and 3' UTRs of young duplicates, indicating that selection may primarily target encoded proteins and regulatory sequences specific to 3' UTRs. Further analysis reveals that natural selection acts immediately after duplication and weakens over time, possibly explaining the observed bias toward the acquisition of new functions by young, rather than old, duplicate gene copies. Last, we find an enrichment of testis-related functions in young duplicates that underwent recent positive selection, but not in young duplicates that did not undergo recent positive selection, or in old duplicates that either did or did not undergo recent positive selection. Thus, our findings reveal that natural selection is a key player in the functional evolution of young duplicate genes, acts rapidly and in a region-specific manner, and may underlie the origin of novel testis-specific phenotypes in Drosophila.",2017,"Xueyuan Jiang, Raquel Assis, Xueyuan Jiang, Raquel Assis"
microRNAs in Drosophila regulate cell fate by repressing single mRNA targets,28621414,10.1387/ijdb.160271ht,"Regulation of gene expression governs all aspects of the lifespan of the organism, such as embryonic development, stem cell differentiation, reproduction and aging. Among the most important regulators of these extremely complex processes are microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs that repress gene expression by binding to primary sequences on the mRNA of their target. Theoretically, the mere existence of a miRNA recognition sequence on a given mRNA is sufficient to generate a functional response. Since these short sequences are abundant, one miRNA can potentially bind to multiple targets, thus generating endless possible biological outcomes. However, is this really the case? Bioinformatics and molecular biology tools provide theoretical interaction predictions, but the data obtained by these methods is often too general and is impaired by false identifications. Therefore, a better understanding of the biological role of miRNAs requires mapping of the exact miRNA-mRNA interactions that occur in vivo. Drosophila melanogaster provides several unique advantages over other model organisms in the study of miRNA functional targeting. The majority of its miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved up to humans, suggesting that they regulate similar pathways across organisms. Complete genome-wide collections make Drosophila the only organism that enables constitutive and inducible gain and loss-of function manipulations of all annotated miRNAs. These powerful tools led to several groundbreaking discoveries of the role that miRNAs play in regulation of development, stem-cell function and aging, and proved that although many outcomes are possible, most Drosophila miRNAs regulate a single phenotype through downregulation of a single major mRNA target.",2017,"Noam Perry, Marina Volin, Hila Toledano, Noam Perry, Marina Volin, Hila Toledano"

The IR60b phenotype shows a high degree of chemical specificity when tested with a broad panel of tastants. An automated analysis of feeding behavior in freely moving flies shows that IR60b limits the duration of individual feeding bouts.

[The effect of the dominant heat-sensitive mutation l(2)M167(DTS) on the fitness of Drosophila melanogaster heterozygotes at preimaginal stages],7958807,,Relative viability of Drosophila melanogaster flies heterozygous for the lethal autosomal temperature-sensitive mutation l(2) M167DTS was studied under permissive conditions. The effect of environmental and genotypic factors on segregation was examined in progeny of reciprocal crosses between the lines l(2)M167DTS SM1 and D-32 (wild type). Comparisons of mass and individual crosses and tests for homogeneity of families and in individual cultures within the total sample imply existence of a complex system of modifiers influenced by culture density and direction of crossing. Correlation analysis of the relationship between larval density and segregation in progeny suggests a threshold level of viability at high density. This causes differences in the composition of progeny of the same parents in mass and individual cultures.

The distribution of mutation effects on viability in Drosophila melanogaster,7896110,,"Parameters of continuous distributions of effects and rates of spontaneous mutation for relative viability in Drosophila are estimated by maximum likelihood from data of two published experiments on accumulation of mutations on protected second chromosomes. A model of equal mutant effects gives a poor fit to the data of the two experiments; higher likelihoods are obtained with leptokurtic distributions or for models in which there is more than one class of mutation effect. Minimum estimates of mutation rates (events per generation) at polygenes affecting viability on chromosome 2 are 0.14 and 0.068, but estimates are strongly confounded with other parameters in the model. Separate information on rates of molecular divergence between Drosophila species and from rates of movement of transposable elements is used to infer the overall genomic mutation rate in Drosophila, and the viability data are analyzed with mutation rate as a known parameter. If, for example, a mutation rate for chromosome 2 of 0.4 is assumed, maximum likelihood estimates of mean mutant effect on relative viability are 0.4% and 1%, but the majority of mutations have very much smaller effects than these values as distributions are highly leptokurtic. The methodology is applied to estimate viability effects of single P element insertional mutations. The mean effect per insertion is found to be higher, and their distribution is found to be less leptokurtic than for spontaneous mutations. The equilibrium genetic variance of viability predicted by a mutation-selection balance model with parameters estimated from the mutation accumulation experiments is similar to laboratory estimates of genetic variance of viability from natural populations of Drosophila.",1994,"P D Keightley, P D Keightley"
THE GENETICS OF VIABILITY IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER: EFFECTS OF INBREEDING AND ARTIFICIAL SELECTION,28564480,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1994.tb05312.x,"Inbreeding and artificial selection experiments were conducted to investigate the genetic properties of egg-to-pupa viability in a population of Drosophila melanogaster. The effect of different levels of inbreeding (F = 0, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.73) was studied. Up to F = 0.50, a linear depression of the mean viability was observed, accompanied by a significant increase of both within-line additive variance and between-line variance. At F = 0.73, no further changes were detected. This can be attributed to natural selection opposing high levels of homozygosity. In parallel, artificial selection to increase viability was performed for 27 generations in (1) a single undivided population (U) and (2) two populations with cycles of subdivision and between-line selection, followed by reconstitution of selected lines (SO and SI ). During the first cycle (generations 0-4), most of the final total response was achieved under all selection regimes. An advantage of the SO and SI strategies was observed after the completion of the first cycle. However, the same limit was reached in all cases because of a delayed response experienced by line U. Reverse selection for viability resulted in positive correlated responses for fecundity and mating success. Both inbreeding and selection results are compatible with the genetic variance of viability in the base population being generated by segregation at a few loci with substantial additive effects and several deleterious recessives at low initial frequencies. Possible reasons for the maintenance of that variance in natural populations are discussed.",1994,"Nieves GarcÃ­a, Carlos LÃ³pez-Fanjul, Aurora GarcÃ­a-Dorado, Nieves GarcÃ­a, Carlos LÃ³pez-Fanjul, Aurora GarcÃ­a-Dorado"

Cloning and sequencing of cDNAs encoding the human hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 indicate the presence of two isoforms in human liver,7926813,10.1016/0378-1119(94)90079-5,Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4) is a key transcription factor involved in the specific expression of many genes in liver and intestine. Sequences of cDNAs coding for HNF-4 have been established in rat and Drosophila melanogaster. Rat HNF-4 exhibits two isoforms which probably result from differential splicing. We have isolated HNF-4 cDNAs from an adult human cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that two HNF-4 isoforms are also present in human liver. The complete sequence of the longest human isoform has been established and compared to the rat HNF-4 amino-acid sequences.,1994,"F L Chartier, J P Bossu, V Laudet, J C Fruchart, B Laine, F L Chartier, J P Bossu, V Laudet, J C Fruchart, B Laine"
The lysozyme locus in Drosophila melanogaster: an expanded gene family adapted for expression in the digestive tract,8159165,10.1007/BF00391008,"Lysozyme has been studied in insects as part of the system of inducible antibacterial defence in the haemolymph. We recently found two Drosophila lysozyme genes that are constitutively expressed in the digestive tract, and are probably involved in the digestion of bacteria in the food. To obtain an overview of the lysozyme genes in this species and their possible roles in immunity and digestion, we have now characterized all six lysozyme genes in the cloned part of the lysozyme locus at 61F, and a seventh gene that maps to the same chromosomal location. The expression of the genes follows four different patterns: firstly, four closely related genes, LysB, C, D and E, are all strongly expressed in the midgut of larvae and adults; secondly, LysP is expressed in the adult salivary gland; thirdly, LysS is expressed mainly in the gastric caecae of larvae; and finally, LysX is primarily expressed in the metamorphosing midgut of late larvae and early pupae. The LysD-like genes and LysS are strongly repressed in artificially infected animals, possibly reflecting a malaise reaction in the digestive tract. None of the genes is expressed in the fat body or haemocytes. Thus rather than being a component of the haemolymph, the Drosophila lysozymes are found mainly in the digestive tract where they are expressed at a high level. Furthermore all genes, except LysP, encode acidic proteins, in contrast to the strongly basic ""typical"" lysozymes. This is highly reminiscent of the situation in ruminants, where the lysozymes have been recruited for the digestion of symbiotic bacteria in the stomach.",1994,"S Daffre, P Kylsten, C Samakovlis, D Hultmark, S Daffre, P Kylsten, C Samakovlis, D Hultmark"

To clarify possible hh functions in adult appendage formation, we isolated a fly line (h9D) associated with a wing malformation from among fly lines with an hh transgene whose expression is under the control of trapped enhancers. In h9D flies, the ectopic expression of hh occurred in the anterior edge of wing pouch in the wing disc. This abnormal hh expression resulted in not only a mirror-image duplication and ectopic outgrowth in the anterior wing compartment, but also the ectopic expression of patched and decapentaplegic, strongly suggesting that the hh product serves as a morphogen or an inducer essential for wing development, including the proximal/distal axis formation.",1994,"T Kojima, T Michiue, M Orihara, K Saigo, T Kojima, T Michiue, M Orihara, K Saigo"

In this study, we assessed the activity of altered or augmented per+ DNA fragments in transformants. Relative expression levels in male and female adults were inferred from periodicities associated with locomotor behavioral rhythms, and by histochemically assessing beta-galactosidase levels in transgenics carrying different kinds of per-lacZ fusion genes.

Protective effect of ethanol on X-ray-induced mitotic recombination in Drosophila melanogaster,7925327,10.1002/em.2850240209,"The effect of ethanol pretreatment on X-ray-induced mitotic recombination in D. melanogaster females was investigated by means of the white/white+ (w/w+) spot test. White females inseminated by yellow males were allowed to oviposit for 8 hr on medium containing 5%, 7.5% and 10% (v/v) ethanol and submitted to 10 Gy of X-rays 52 hr after the beginning of the egg laying period (chronic treatments). For acute treatments 56 +/- 4-hr-old larvae grown in regular medium were held in petri dishes containing filter paper soaked with 50% (v/v) ethanol for 30 min before being irradiated with 10 Gy. The emerging heterozygous w/w+ females were inspected for the presence of white spots (LS) in their eyes. Acute ethanol pretreatments lead to a significant reduction in the frequency of LS. This is suggested to be due to the scavenging by ethanol of free radicals originating during irradiation. If so, the contribution of the indirect action of radiation to mitotic recombination induced by X-rays must be significant. Chronic ethanol pretreatments also resulted in a decrease of LS, though impairment of larval development by ethanol may have partly contributed to the effect observed. At the concentrations tested, ethanol by itself did not modify the frequency of LS observed in the control.",1994,"A M Palermo, M Rey, E R MuÃ±oz, A M Palermo, M Rey, E R MuÃ±oz"

Gene replacement showed that swi6 is not essential for viability. The Swi6 protein is very hydrophilic; it contains 41% charged aa. A region of 48 aa is homologous to a sequence motif found in the chromatin-associated proteins, HP1 and Polycomb (Drosophila melanogaster), M31, M32 and M33 (mouse), and the human HSM1 protein.

Adh gene frequencies returned to preperturbation levels in a predictable manner. A model in which the relative fitness of Adh phenotypes was determined by temperature-dependent specific activities of enzymes of Adh genotypes adequately accounts for the rate of gene frequency change at this locus.

Lines 12 and 2 showed the presence of insertions in the 85D9/10 and 86B4/6 interband regions, respectively. The absence of a novel band in line 3 could be associated with transposon integration into the band. In line 41, puffing of the transformed region was observed, which did not allow us to determine the presence of any novel structures in it. The novel structures in lines 12 and 2 looked like single bands with a similar DNA packing ratio of about 30.

Neutral and non-neutral evolution of Drosophila mitochondrial DNA,7851771,,"To test hypotheses of neutral evolution of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), nucleotide sequences were determined for 1515 base pairs of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) gene in the mitochondrial DNA of 29 lines of Drosophila melanogaster and 9 lines of its sibling species Drosophila simulans. In contrast to the patterns for nuclear genes, where D. melanogaster generally exhibits much less nucleotide polymorphism, the number of segregating sites was slightly higher in a global sample of nine ND5 sequences in D. melanogaster (s = 8) than in the nine lines of D. simulans (s = 6). When compared to variation at nuclear loci, the mtDNA variation in D. melanogaster does not depart from neutral expectations. The ND5 sequences in D. simulans, however, show fewer than half the number of variable sites expected under neutrality when compared to sequences from the period locus. While this reduction in variation is not significant at the 5% level, HKA tests with published restriction data for mtDNA in D. simulans do show a significant reduction of variation suggesting a selective sweep of variation in the mtDNA in this species. Tests of neutral evolution based on the ratios of synonymous and replacement polymorphism and divergence are generally consistent with neutral expectations, although a significant excess of amino acid polymorphism within both species is localized in one region of the protein. The rate of mtDNA evolution has been faster in D. melanogaster than in D. simulans and the population structure of mtDNA is distinct in these species. The data reveal how different rates of mtDNA evolution between species and different histories of neutral and adaptive evolution within species can compromise historical inferences in population and evolutionary biology.",1994,"D M Rand, M Dorfsman, L M Kann, D M Rand, M Dorfsman, L M Kann"

The free-running period (tau) is 25.3 hr, one hour longer than in the wild-type. In the phase response curve (PRC), the ratio between the delay and the advance portion is larger and the cross-over point occurs later, although there is no difference in amplitude of the mutant's PRC (Type I).

Adult flies developing without MBs behave normally in most respects, but are unable to perform in a classical conditioning paradigm that tests associative learning of odor cues and electric shock.

Interspecific sequence comparison of the muscle-myosin heavy-chain genes from Drosophila hydei and Drosophila melanogaster,7966366,10.1007/BF00160268,"The muscle-myosin heavy-chain (mMHC) gene of Drosophila hydei has been sequenced completely (size 23.3 kb). The sequence comparison with the D. melanogaster mMHC gene revealed that the exon-intron pattern is identical. The protein coding regions show a high degree of conservation (97%). The alternatively spliced exons (3a-b, 7a-d, 9a-c, 11a-e, and 15a-b) display more variations in the number of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions than the common exons (2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 19). The base composition at synonymous sites of fourfold degenerate codons (third position) is not biased in the alternative exons. In the common exons there exists a bias for C and against A. These findings imply that the alternative exons of the Drosophila mMHC gene evolve at a different, in several cases higher, rate than the common ones. The 5' splice junctions and 5' and 3' untranslated regions show a high level of similarity, indicating a functional constraint on these sequences. The intron regions vary considerably in length within one species, but the corresponding introns are very similar in length between the two species and all contain stretches of sequence similarity.

Molecular characterization of four mutant alleles of this protein in Drosophila melanogaster has permitted an investigation of synaptotagmin's role in synaptic physiology and of some of the structural requirements for its function. Reduced levels of synaptotagmin resulted in a substantial alteration in synaptic function in the eye and at larval neuromuscular junctions. Decreased neurotransmitter release caused smaller evoked synaptic potentials. However, the frequency, but not the size, of spontaneous quantal events was simultaneously increased. These abnormalities do not appear to be secondary to a detectable morphological change in the arborization of the synapse. The increased frequency of spontaneous events was insufficient to deplete significantly the vesicle supply and thereby account for reduced transmission.

FITNESS SENSITIVITY AND THE CANALIZATION OF LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS,28568425,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1994.tb02186.x,"Canalization is an abstract term that describes unknown developmental mechanisms that reduce phenotypic variation. A trait can be canalized against environmental perturbations (e.g., changes in temperature or nutrient quality), or genetic perturbations (e.g., mutations or recombination); this paper is about genetic canalization. Stabilizing selection should improve the canalization of traits, and the degree of canalization should be positively correlated with the traits' impact on fitness. Experiments testing this idea should measure the canalization of a series of traits whose impact on fitness is known or can be inferred, exclude differences among traits in the number of loci and alleles segregating as an explanation for the pattern of variability found, and distinguish between canalization against genetic and environmental variation. These conditions were met by three experiments within which the variation of fitness components among Drosophila melanogaster lines was measured and among which the genetic contribution to the variation among lines was clearly different. The canalization of the traits increased with their impact on fitness and did not depend on the degree of genetic differences among lines. That the flies used had been transformed by a P-element insert suggests that canalization was also effective against novel genetic variation. The results reported here cannot be explained by the classical hypothesis of reduction in the number of loci segregating for traits with greater impact on fitness and confirm that traits with greater impact on fitness are more strongly canalized. This pattern of canalization reveals an underappreciated role for development in microevolution. There is differential genetic canalization of fitness components in D. melanogaster.",1994,"Stephen C Stearns, Tadeusz J Kawecki, Stephen C Stearns, Tadeusz J Kawecki"

Partial peptide digestions of Drosophila and Musca PRIs revealed similarity between these proteins. We observed that Drosophila PRI exists in the random preparation, but it also exists in other subcellular fractions. Immunocytochemistry at the EM level revealed a distribution of both Drosophila and Musca PRI epitopes in membranous vesicular structures in the cytosol as well as in the rhabdomeric microvillar membranes where the visual pigment, rhodopsin, exists.

The evolution of abdominal reduction and the recent origin of distinct Abdominal-B transcript classes in Diptera,16686635,10.1111/j.1525-142X.2006.00095.x,"In insects, the Hox gene Abdominal-B (Abd-B) governs the development of the posterior-most segments, the number and fate of which differ within and between orders. A striking feature of insect evolution is a trend toward the reduction of posterior abdominal segments which is most pronounced in higher Diptera. In Drosophila melanogaster, two distinct Abd-B transcript classes and protein isoforms are expressed in non-overlapping domains and have discrete functions in patterning the posterior abdomen. It has been proposed that evolutionary changes in Abd-B structure and expression are responsible for the reduction of the dipteran abdomen. We have investigated the relationship between the evolution of the Abd-B gene and abdominal reduction by analyzing the structure and expression of homologs from four additional dipterans representing distinct clades within the order. The lower dipteran mosquito Anopheles gambiae expresses a single Abd-B transcript class, as do two species phylogenetically intermediate to mosquitoes and drosophilids. These results delimit the evolution of distinct functional Abd-B isoforms to within the dipteran radiation after the origin of the reduced abdominal morphology. Furthermore, we found that the spatial distribution of Abd-B transcripts in non-drosophilid Diptera is identical to the combined domains of the two D. melanogaster Abd-B transcripts. Therefore, neither the structural evolution nor changes in the spatial regulation of Abd-B account for the derived abdomen of higher Diptera. The recent subfunctionalization of this Hox gene has occurred without any apparent morphological correlate. We conclude that regulatory modifications to developmental programs downstream of or parallel to Abd-B are responsible for the evolutionary reduction of the higher dipteran postabdomen.",2006,"John H Yoder, Sean B Carroll, John H Yoder, Sean B Carroll"
"Morphology and metamorphosis of the peptidergic Va neurons and the median nerve system of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster",16685531,10.1007/s00441-006-0211-7,"Metamorphosis is a fundamental developmental process and has been intensively studied for various neuron types of Drosophila melanogaster. However, detailed accounts of the fate of identified peptidergic neurons are rare. We have performed a detailed study of the larval morphology and pupal remodelling of identified peptidergic neurons, the CAPA-expressing Va neurons of D. melanogaster. In the larva, Va neurons innervate abdominal median and transverse nerves that are typically associated with perisympathetic organs (PSOs), major neurohaemal release sites in insects. Since median and transverse nerves are lacking in the adult, Va neurites have to undergo substantial remodelling during metamorphosis. We have examined the hitherto uncharacterised gross morphology of the thoracic PSOs and the abdominal median and transverse nerves by scanning electron microscopy and found that the complete reduction of these structures during metamorphosis starts around pupal stage P7 and is completed at P9. Concomitantly, neurite pruning of the Va neurons begins at P6 and is preceded by the high expression of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) subtype B1 in late L3 larvae and the first pupal stages. New neuritic outgrowth mainly occurs from P7-P9 and coincides with the expression of EcR-A, indicating that the remodelling of the Va neurons is under ecdysteroid control. Immunogold-labelling has located the CAPA peptides to large translucent vesicles, which are released from the transverse nerves, as suggested by fusion profiles.

Reduced inbreeding depression due to historical inbreeding in Drosophila melanogaster: evidence for purging,16780526,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2005.01074.x,"An important issue in conservation biology and the study of evolution is the extent to which inbreeding depression can be reduced or reversed by natural selection. If the deleterious recessive alleles causing inbreeding depression can be 'purged' by natural selection, outbred populations that have a history of inbreeding are expected to be less susceptible to inbreeding depression. This expectation, however, has not been realized in previous laboratory experiments. In the present study, we used Drosophila melanogaster as a model system to test for an association between inbreeding history and inbreeding depression. We created six 'purged' populations from experimental lineages that had been maintained at a population size of 10 male-female pairs for 19 generations. We then measured the inbreeding depression that resulted from one generation of full-sib mating in the purged populations and in the original base population. The magnitude of inbreeding depression in the purged populations was approximately one-third of that observed in the original base population.

Mutations in the K+/Cl- cotransporter gene kazachoc (kcc) increase seizure susceptibility in Drosophila,16943550,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4998-05.2006,"During a critical period in the developing mammalian brain, there is a major switch in the nature of GABAergic transmission from depolarizing and excitatory, the pattern of the neonatal brain, to hyperpolarizing and inhibitory, the pattern of the mature brain. This switch is believed to play a major role in determining neuronal connectivity via activity-dependent mechanisms. The GABAergic developmental switch may also be particularly vulnerable to dysfunction leading to seizure disorders. The developmental GABA switch is mediated primarily by KCC2, a neuronal K+/Cl- cotransporter that determines the intracellular concentration of Cl- and, hence, the reversal potential for GABA. Here, we report that kazachoc (kcc) mutations that reduce the level of the sole K+/Cl- cotransporter in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster render flies susceptible to epileptic-like seizures. Drosophila kcc protein is widely expressed in brain neuropil, and its level rises with developmental age. Young kcc mutant flies with low kcc levels display behavioral seizures and demonstrate a reduced threshold for seizures induced by electroconvulsive shock. The kcc mutation enhances a series of other Drosophila epilepsy mutations indicating functional interactions leading to seizure disorder. Both genetic and pharmacological experiments suggest that the increased seizure susceptibility of kcc flies occurs via excitatory GABAergic signaling. The kcc mutants provide an excellent model system in which to investigate how modulation of GABAergic signaling influences neuronal excitability and epileptogenesis.",2006,"Daria S Hekmat-Scafe, Miriam Y Lundy, Rakhee Ranga, Mark A Tanouye, Daria S Hekmat-Scafe, Miriam Y Lundy, Rakhee Ranga, Mark A Tanouye"

In Drosophila melanogaster, a negative feedback loop of gene expression has been shown to contribute to the clock mechanism. Here, we describe some features of the circadian clock of the sandfly Lutzomyia longipalpis, a vector of visceral leishmaniasis. Compared to D. melanogaster, sandfly period and timeless, two negative elements of the feedback loop, show similar peaks of mRNA abundance. On the other hand, the expression of Clock (a positive transcription factor) differs between the two species, raising the possibility that the different phases of Clock expression could be associated with the observed differences in circadian activity rhythms. In addition, we show a reduction in locomotor activity after a blood meal, which is correlated with downregulation of period and timeless expression levels.

Reevaluation of Drosophila melanogaster's neuronal circadian pacemakers reveals new neuronal classes,16856134,10.1002/cne.21021,"In the brain of the fly Drosophila melanogaster, approximately 150 clock-neurons are organized to synchronize and maintain behavioral rhythms, but the physiological and neurochemical bases of their interactions are largely unknown. Here we reevaluate the cellular properties of these pacemakers by application of a novel genetic reporter and several phenotypic markers. First, we describe an enhancer trap marker called R32 that specifically reveals several previously undescribed aspects of the fly's central neuronal pacemakers. We find evidence for a previously unappreciated class of neuronal pacemakers, the lateral posterior neurons (LPNs), and establish anatomical, molecular, and developmental criteria to establish a subclass within the dorsal neuron 1 (DN1) group of pacemakers. Furthermore, we show that the neuropeptide IPNamide is specifically expressed by this DN1 subclass. These observations implicate IPNamide as a second candidate circadian transmitter in the Drosophila brain.

Remarkable site specificity of local transposition into the Hsp70 promoter of Drosophila melanogaster,16582443,10.1534/genetics.105.053959,"Heat-shock genes have numerous features that ought to predispose them to insertional mutagenesis via transposition. To elucidate the evolvability of heat-shock genes via transposition, we have exploited a local transposition technique and Drosophila melanogaster strains with EPgy2 insertions near the Hsp70 gene cluster at 87A7 to produce numerous novel EPgy2 insertions into these Hsp70 genes. More than 50% of 45 independent insertions were made into two adjacent nucleotides in the proximal promoter at positions -96 and -97, and no insertions were into a coding or 3'-flanking sequence. All inserted transposons were in inverse orientation to the starting transposon. The frequent insertion into nucleotides -96 and -97 is consistent with the DNase hypersensitivity, absence of nucleosomes, flanking GAGA-factor-binding sites, and nucleotide sequence of this region. These experimental insertions recapitulated many of the phenotypes of natural transposition into Hsp70: reduced mRNA expression, less Hsp70 protein, and decreased inducible thermotolerance. The results suggest that the distinctive features of heat-shock promoters, which underlie the massive and rapid expression of heat-shock genes upon heat shock, also are a source of evolutionary variation on which natural selection can act.",2006,"Victoria Y Shilova, David G Garbuz, Elena N Myasyankina, Bing Chen, Michael B Evgen'ev, Martin E Feder, Olga G Zatsepina, Victoria Y Shilova, David G Garbuz, Elena N Myasyankina, Bing Chen, Michael B Evgen'ev, Martin E Feder, Olga G Zatsepina"
An alpha-L-fucosidase potentially involved in fertilization is present on Drosophila spermatozoa surface,16736526,10.1002/mrd.20425,"Drosophila is emerging as a model organism to investigate egg fertilization in insects and the possible conservation of molecular mechanisms of gamete interactions demonstrated in higher organisms. This study shows that the spermatozoa of several species of Drosophila belonging to the melanogaster group have a plasma membrane associated alpha-L-fucosidase with features in common with alpha-L-fucosidases from sperm of other animals, including mammals. The enzyme has been purified and completely characterized in D. ananassae, because of its stability in this species. The sperm alpha-L-fucosidase is an integral protein terminally mannosylated, with the catalytic site oriented toward the extracellular space. It has a M(r) of 256 kDa and a multimeric structure made up by subunits of 48 and 55 kDa. Enzyme characterization included kinetic properties, pI, optimal pH, and thermal stability. A soluble form of the enzyme similar to the sperm associated alpha-L-fucosidase is secreted by the seminal vesicles. Synthetic peptides designed from the deduced product of the D. melanogaster gene encoding an alpha-L-fucosidase were used to raise a specific polyclonal antibody. Immunofluorescence labeling of spermatozoa showed that the enzyme is present in the sperm plasma membrane overlying the acrosome and the tail. Lectin cytochemistry analysis of the egg surface indicated that alpha-L-fucose terminal residues are present on the chorion with a strongly polarized localization on the micropyle. The alpha-L-fucosidase of Drosophila sperm plasma membrane appears to be potentially involved in gamete recognition by interacting with its glycoside ligands present on the egg surface at the site of sperm entry.",2006,"Jari Intra, Federica Cenni, Maria-Elisa Perotti, Jari Intra, Federica Cenni, Maria-Elisa Perotti"

The density dynamics in the hemolymph were reminiscent of those in the whole body, whereas the density dynamics in the fat body, intestine and ovary were not. These results suggest that the majority of the spiroplasmas colonize and proliferate in the hemolymph of the host.

The RNA silencing endonuclease Argonaute 2 mediates specific antiviral immunity in Drosophila melanogaster,17079687,10.1101/gad.1482006,"Most organisms have evolved defense mechanisms to protect themselves from viruses and other pathogens. Arthropods lack the protein-based adaptive immune response found in vertebrates. Here we show that the central catalytic component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), the nuclease Argonaute 2 (Ago-2), is essential for antiviral defense in adult Drosophila melanogaster. Ago-2-defective flies are hypersensitive to infection with a major fruit fly pathogen, Drosophila C virus (DCV), and with Cricket Paralysis virus (CrPV). Increased mortality in ago-2 mutant flies was associated with a dramatic increase in viral RNA accumulation and virus titers. The physiological significance of this antiviral mechanism is underscored by our finding that DCV encodes a potent suppressor of RNA interference (RNAi). This suppressor binds long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and inhibits Dicer-2-mediated processing of dsRNA into short interfering RNA (siRNA), but does not bind short siRNAs or disrupt the microRNA (miRNA) pathway. Based on these results we propose that RNAi is a major antiviral immune defense mechanism in Drosophila.",2006,"Ronald P van Rij, Maria-Carla Saleh, Bassam Berry, Catherine Foo, Andrew Houk, Christophe Antoniewski, Raul Andino, Ronald P van Rij, Maria-Carla Saleh, Bassam Berry, Catherine Foo, Andrew Houk, Christophe Antoniewski, Raul Andino"

While various studies have documented age-related changes in the genetic contribution to variation in fitness components, we know very little about the underlying genetic architecture of such changes. We used a set of recombinant inbred lines to map and characterize the effects of quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting fecundity of Drosophila melanogaster females at 1 and 4 weeks of age. We identified one QTL on the second chromosome and one or two QTL affecting fecundity on the third chromosome, but these QTL affected fecundity only at 1 week of age. There was more genetic variation for fecundity at 4 weeks of age than at 1 week of age and there was no genetic correlation between early and late-age fecundity. These results suggest that different loci contribute to the variation in fecundity as the organism ages. Our data provide support for the mutation accumulation theory of aging as applied to reproductive senescence. Comparing the results from this study with our previous work on life-span QTL, we also find evidence that antagonistic pleiotropy may contribute to the genetic basis of senescence in these lines as well.",2006,"Jeff Leips, Paul Gilligan, Trudy F C Mackay, Jeff Leips, Paul Gilligan, Trudy F C Mackay"
Adaptive loss of an old duplicated gene during incipient speciation,16251509,10.1093/molbev/msj045,"To probe the role of natural selection in species origin, we performed a DNA polymorphism survey of the Drosophila melanogaster desaturase2 (ds2) locus. ds2 is responsible for a cuticular hydrocarbon difference between two behaviorally isolated races--Zimbabwe (Z) and Cosmopolitan (M). The ds2 allele prevalent in the Z populations is functional, while the allele from the M populations harbors a 16-bp deletion upstream of the gene which knocks out its expression. We find a signature of positive selection in the ds2 promoter, but not in the control gene, sas. This signature appears to be confined to the derived M population. We also find that the selection has been recent because the gene retains a signature of a selective sweep evidenced by the departure of Fay and Wu's H test from neutral expectation. We also find that ds2, as well as its duplicate pair ds1, has been maintained in the Drosophila genus for at least 40 Myr without any sign of adaptive change.

We estimate a recent bottleneck 0.006N(e) generations ago, somewhat further in the past than suggested by biogeographical evidence. Using various proposed statistical tests, we find that this bottleneck model is able to predict the majority of observed features of diversity and linkage disequilibrium in the data. Thus, while precise estimates of bottleneck parameters (like inferences of selection) are sensitive to model assumptions, our results imply that it may be unnecessary to invoke frequent selective sweeps associated with the dispersal of D. melanogaster from Africa to explain patterns of variability in non-African populations.",2006,"Kevin Thornton, Peter Andolfatto, Kevin Thornton, Peter Andolfatto"

These miRNAs are usually highly conserved between the genomes of related organisms and their pre-miRNA transcript, about 60-120 nt long, forms extended stem-loop structure. Keeping these facts in mind miRsearch is developed which relies on searching the homologues of all known miRNAs of one organism in the genome of a related organism allowing few mismatches depending on the phylogenetic distance between them, followed by assessing for the capability of formation of stem-loop structure. The precursor sequences so obtained were then screened through the RNA folding program MFOLD selecting the cut-off values on the basis of known Drosophila melanogaster pre-miRNAs. With this approach, about 91 probable candidate miRNAs along with pre-miRNAs were identified in Anopheles gambiae using known D. melanogaster miRNAs.

Against the background of ovulin's high sequence variability within and between species, we have identified highly conserved motifs that may play an important structural role. Using yeast two-hybrid and GST-pull-down assays, we show that ovulin interacts with itself. The C terminus of ovulin is necessary and sufficient for self-interaction, with its C-terminal 45 aa playing a major role. Under nonreducing conditions, ovulin participates in a high-molecular-mass complex, suggesting that it occurs in an oligomeric form. One or more of three predicted coiled-coil domains in the C terminus of ovulin may be involved in its self-interaction. These structural elements are conserved between species despite an overall rapid pace of evolution in ovulin's primary sequence. We therefore suggest that domains involved in ovulin's self-interaction form a conserved structural backbone for the protein, resulting in greater evolutionary flexibility at other sites.",2006,"Alex Wong, Shannon N Albright, Mariana F Wolfner, Alex Wong, Shannon N Albright, Mariana F Wolfner"

Our preliminary results indicate that the second intron of the Trl gene bears functionally significant elements. To test this assumption, we generated 23 novel alleles of the gene via P-induced male recombination and analyzed them cytogenetically. Of these mutations, 13 (recessive lethals) are deletions, disrupting the coding gene region. Ten mutations (seven deletions and three duplications) remove parts of the second Trl intron only.

A lower proportion of insertion sites on the X chromosome in comparison with the autosomes suggests that selection against the detrimental effects of TE insertions is the major force containing TE copies in populations of Drosophila. This selection effect hypothesis is strengthened by the absence of the negative correlation between recombinaiton rate and TE copy number along the chromosomes, which was expected under the alternative ectopic exchange model (selection against the deleterious rearrangements promoted by recombination between TE insertions). A cline in 412 copy number in relation to latitude was observed among the natural populations of D. simulans, with very high numbers existing in some local populations (around 60 copies in a sample from Canberra, Australia). An apparent absence of selection effects in this Canberra sample and a value of transposition rate equal to 1-2 x 10(-3) whatever the population and its copy number agree with the idea of recent but temporarily drastic TE movements in local populations.

Introns boost transgene expression in Drosophila melanogaster,9150263,10.1007/s004380050418,"Using Drosophila as a host, we have examined the effect that the presence of an intron has on the accumulation of a processed transgene mRNA. To provide a model system that was free from major position effects, two fish antifreeze protein (AFP) transgenes were arranged in divergent transcriptional orientation from a central Drosophila yolk protein promoter/enhancer region and introduced into the flies by P-element transformation and/or mobilization. In this way the organization of both the structural genes and the promoter elements mimicked their natural arrangements. When one member of the fish AFP transgene pair had its single 180 bp intron deleted, there was a 2- to 11-fold (average 5-fold) decrease in its mRNA level compared to that generated from the control gene containing the fish AFP intervening sequence. When the deleted intron was replaced by a 70 bp intervening sequence originating from the yolk protein 1 gene, mRNA accumulation was restored to its original level. Even for the streamlined genome of Drosophila, where the intron number and size are generally reduced compared to mammals, the presence of an intervening sequence appears to facilitate mRNA accumulation.",1997,"B P Duncker, P L Davies, V K Walker, B P Duncker, P L Davies, V K Walker"
An analysis of resource allocation in response to dietary yeast in Drosophila melanogaster,12770456,10.1016/s0022-1910(97)00037-1,"Drosophila melanogaster exhibit an increase in fecundity and a decrease in length of life and starvation resistance when the diet is enriched through the addition of live yeast. It has been proposed that this represents a necessary energetic trade-off between reproductive and somatic functions. We examined the metabolic aspects of this trade-off. We measured egg production, dry wt, somatic lipid and carbohydrate storage, and metabolic rate in response to changing amounts of live dietary yeast. These variables were measured in five replicate populations selected for postponed aging and five replicate short lived control populations. We find that all ten populations show an overall increase in egg production and decrease in the amount of stored metabolites in the presence of increasing amounts of yeast. All populations increase metabolic rate in response to increasing amounts of live dietary yeast. The energetics of this phenomenon suggest that increased egg production results from increased acquisition of nutrients available in yeast with only a small redirection of resources from storage to egg production.",1997,"T J.

ADAPTATION AND SPECIALIZATION IN A TWO-RESOURCE ENVIRONMENT IN DROSOPHILA SPECIES,28568582,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb03666.x,"We assayed two components of performance (development time and survivorship), on food medium with and without ethanol, in laboratory populations of Drosophila simulans and D. melanogaster for which ethanol-medium was a novel food resource. These assays were done before and after 12 generations of rearing in either one-(regular medium only) or two-resource (regular medium and ethanol medium) environments. Initially, D. simulans was highly susceptible to ethanol, whereas D. melanogaster was relatively unaffected. After 12 generations in the two-resource environment, D. simulans showed significantly improved mean performance on ethanol medium; mean performance of D. melanogaster did not significantly change. Variation among families for both traits was higher on ethanol medium in D. simulans. Variation in D. melanogaster was not significantly affected by ethanol level, suggesting that resource quality was more important than novelty per se. In both species, the least variation was seen in populations after 12 generations in the two-resource environment. For development time in D. simulans, the decrease in variation was largely due to reduced variation within families, suggesting the evolution of canalization. Development time on the two media was not negatively correlated. In D. simulans, correlations measured before and after the experiment were not heterogeneous, suggesting that trade-offs in performance did not block diet expansion. In D. melanogaster, correlations became significantly less positive after 12 generations in the two-resource environment, supporting the view that correlations between performance on different resources may become less positive over time through selection.",1997,"Amitabh Joshi, John N Thompson, Amitabh Joshi, John N Thompson"

Recently, some components of the nuclear trafficking machinery have also been identified in Drosophila melanogaster allowing the study of phenotypes of mutant trafficking genes during multicellular development.

Evolutionary conservation of regulatory strategies for the sex determination factor transformer-2,9111363,10.1128/mcb.17.5.2908,"Sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster is regulated by a cascade of splicing factors which direct the sex-specific expression of gene products needed for male and female differentiation. The splicing factor TRA-2 affects sex-specific splicing of multiple pre-mRNAs involved in sexual differentiation. The tra-2 gene itself expresses a complex set of mRNAs generated through alternative processing that collectively encode three distinct protein isoforms. The expression of these isoforms differs in the soma and germ line. In the male germ line the ratio of two isoforms present is governed by autoregulation of splicing. However, the functional significance of multiple TRA-2 isoforms has remained uncertain. Here we have examined whether the structure, function, and regulation of tra-2 are conserved in Drosophila virilis, a species diverged from D. melanogaster by over 60 million years. We find that the D. virilis homolog of tra-2 produces alternatively spliced RNAs encoding a set of protein isoforms analogous to those found in D. melanogaster. When introduced into the genome of D. melanogaster, this homolog can functionally replace the endogenous tra-2 gene for both normal female sexual differentiation and spermatogenesis. Examination of alternative mRNAs produced in D. virilis testes suggests that germ line-specific autoregulation of tra-2 function is accomplished by a strategy similar to that used in D. melanogaster. The similarity in structure and function of the tra-2 genes in these divergent Drosophila species supports the idea that sexual differentiation in D. melanogaster and D. virilis is accomplished under the control of similar regulatory pathways.",1997,"D Chandler, M E McGuffin, J Piskur, J Yao, B S Baker, W Mattox"

In this study, the presence and distribution of this protein, in comparison with that of paramyosin and myosin, has been examined in the striated muscle (tergal depressor of trochanter) of Drosophila melanogaster, and the obliquely striated muscle (body wall) and the smooth muscle (outer layer of the pseudoheart) of the earthworm Eisenia foetida by means of immunocytochemical electron microscopic study and Western blot analysis miniparamyosin paramyosin and myosin antibodies from Drosophila. In the striated muscle of D. melanogaster, the three proteins were immunolocalized along the length of the thick filaments (A-bands). The distribution of immunogold particles along these filaments was uniform. The relative proportions miniparamyosin/paramyosin/myosin (calculated by counting the number of immunogold particles) were: 1/10/68. In the obliquely striated muscle of E. foetida, immunoreactions to the three proteins were also found in the thick filaments, and the relative proportions miniparamyosin/paramyosin/myosin were 1/2.4/6.9. However, whereas the distribution of both myosin and miniparamyosin along the thick filament length was uniform, paramyosin immunolabelling was more abundant in the extremes of thick filaments (the outer zones of A-bands in the obliquely striated muscle), where the thick filaments become thinner than in the centre (the central zone of A-bands), where these filaments are thicker. The relative proportions of paramyosin in the outer and of paramyosin in the central zones of A-bands were 4/1. This irregular distribution of paramyosin along the thick filament length might be actual but it may also be explained by the fusiform shape of thick filaments in the earthworm: assuming that paramyosin is covered by myosin, paramyosin antigens would be more exposed in the tips than in the centre of thick filaments. If miniparamyosin is, in turn, covered by paramyosin, the exposure of miniparamyosin antigens would be low even in the tips of thick filaments, and this might explain the scanty immunoreaction observed for this protein and the absence of a higher number of immunogold particles in the extremes of thick filaments. The distribution of the three proteins in the earthworm smooth muscle was as in the obliquely striated muscle, although the proportions miniparamyosin/paramyosin/myosin were 1/1.5/5.2; this is, immunoreactions to paramyosin and miniparamyosin were lower than in the obliquely striated muscle.",1997,"M Royuela, B Fraile, M Cervera, R Paniagua, M Royuela, B Fraile, M Cervera, R Paniagua"
About the origin of retroviruses and the co-evolution of the gypsy retrovirus with the Drosophila flamenco host gene,9440256,,"The gypsy element of Drosophila melanogaster is the first retrovirus identified so far in invertebrates. According to phylogenetic data, gypsy belongs to the same group as the Ty3 class of LTR-retrotransposons, which suggests that retroviruses evolved from this kind of retroelements before the radiation of vertebrates. There are other invertebrate retroelements that are also likely to be endogenous retroviruses because they share with gypsy some structural and functional retroviral-like characteristics. Gypsy is controlled by a Drosophila gene called flamenco, the restrictive alleles of which maintain the retrovirus in a repressed state. In permissive strains, functional gypsy elements transpose at high frequency and produce infective particles. Defective gypsy proviruses located in pericentromeric heterochromatin of all strains seem to be very old components of the genome of Drosophila melanogaster, which indicates that gypsy invaded this species, or an ancestor, a long time ago. At that time, Drosophila melanogaster presumably contained permissive alleles of the flamenco gene. One can imagine that the species survived to the increase of genetic load caused by the retroviral invasion because restrictive alleles of flamenco were selected. The characterization of a retrovirus in Drosophila, one of the most advanced model organisms for molecular genetics, provides us with an exceptional clue to study how a species can resist a retroviral invasion.",1997,"A PÃ©lisson, L Teysset, F Chalvet, A Kim, N Prud'homme, C Terzian, A Bucheton, A PÃ©lisson, L Teysset, F Chalvet, A Kim, N Prud'homme, C Terzian, A Bucheton"
Alternative activation of transcriptional initiators in Drosophila melanogaster LINE promoters,9271203,10.1016/s0014-5793(97)00689-3,"In the Drosophila I, F and Doc LINEs, basal transcription is ensured by the functional interaction of initiator sequences with intragenic regulatory segments (B regions) which comprise distinct functional modules. Removing the B regions, as changing their composition or location, allowed different activators to stimulate transcription from novel initiators both in Doc and F promoters. The use of distinct initiators plausibly reflects the assembly of transcriptional complexes in which TFIID assumes alternative spatial conformations. The response of I, F and Doc promoters to the same enhancer is significantly influenced by the number, position and type of core elements present.",1997,"G Minchiotti, P P Di Nocera, G Minchiotti, P P Di Nocera"
The DFer gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes two membrane-associated proteins that can both transform vertebrate cells,9038371,10.1038/sj.onc.1200875,"The vertebrate gene FER encodes two protein-tyrosine kinases with molecular weights of 51,000 and 94,000 and distinctive aminotermini. The larger kinase is expressed ubiquitously among vertebrate tissues, whereas expression of the smaller kinase appears to be limited to spermatogenic cells in the testes. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster contains an apparent ortholog of FER (DFer) that also produces two mRNAs by separate initiation of transcription, and two proteins with molecular weights of 45,000 and 92,000. Both proteins are in part loosely associated with cytoplasmic membranes. Both can transform avian and rodent cells with roughly equal potency, when expressed from retroviral vectors. Fusing the myristoylation signal from the SRC protein-tyrosine kinase to the aminoterminus of the DFer protein increased the strength of attachment to membranes but augmented transformation only marginally. The results provide the first demonstration of neoplastic transformation by a protein-tyrosine kinase of Drosophila and by FER from any species. The products of Drosophila and vertebrate FER may be part of similar signaling pathways in the two species.",1997,"R Paulson, J Jackson, K Immergluck, J M Bishop, R Paulson, J Jackson, K Immergluck, J M Bishop"

This is the first description of a desaturase sequence in insects. Two cDNAs were cloned: the combined 1.5 kb nucleotide sequences indicate that the gene encodes a polypeptide of 383 amino acid residues with a high sequence similarity to the well defined delta 9 desaturases from rat and yeast and desaturases from carp and tick. The Drosophila protein contains two histidine cluster motifs (HXXHH) and two hydrophobic regions which are conserved among all desaturases, whereas the amino and carboxy ends look more variable. The desaturase gene seems to be expressed in adults at a low level, with a greater prevalence in females than in males. Two genomic sequences have been amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and have a very similar open reading frame but a different organization; one with three introns and the other without introns. Both seem to correspond to two distinct genes and have been named ""desat locus"". They are localized to a single locus, 87C, on the right arm of the third chromosome.

Immunocytochemical electron microscopic study and Western blot analysis of caldesmon and calponin in striated muscle of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and in several muscle cell types of the earthworm Eisenia foetida,9013730,,"Caldesmon and calponin are two proteins that are characteristic of vertebrate smooth muscle. In invertebrates, caldesmon has only been studied in some molluscan muscles, and no previous references to calponin have been found. The aim of this paper was to investigate the presence and distribution of caldesmon and calponin in several invertebrate muscle cell types, classified according to their ultrastructural pattern: transversely striated muscle (flight muscle from Drosophila melanogaster), obliquely striated muscle (muscular body wall and inner muscular layer of the pseudoheart from the earthworm Eisenia foetida), and a muscle of doubtful classification which seems to be intermediate between smooth muscle and obliquely striated muscle (outer muscular layer of the pseudoheart, from E. foetida), using electron microscopy immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis. Immunoreactions to both caldesmon and calponin were observed in the outer muscular layer cells from the earthworm pseudoheart but neither in the transversely striated muscle of D. melanogaster nor in the obliquely striated muscle from the earthworm. Present findings suggest that caldesmon- and calponin-like proteins are also present in invertebrate muscle cells, but only in those that are ultrastructurally similar to the vertebrate smooth muscle cells. Since discrepancies in the classification of some invertebrate muscles are common in the literature, the use of distinctive markers, such as troponin, caldesmon and calponin may improve our understanding of the nature and properties of many invertebrate muscles showing an ultrastructural pattern that does not resemble any of the classic muscle types.",1997,"M Royuela, B Fraile, M L Picazo, R Paniagua, M Royuela, B Fraile, M L Picazo, R Paniagua"

Two-step induction of chordotonal organ precursors in Drosophila embryogenesis,9056779,,"The chordotonal (Ch) organ, an internal stretch receptor located in the subepidermal layer, is one of the major sensory organs in the peripheral nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster. Although the cell lineage of the Ch organ has been well characterized in many studies, the determination machinery of Ch organ precursor cells (COPs) remains largely unresolved. Here we report that the rhomboid (rho) gene and the activity of the Drosophila EGF receptor (DER) signaling pathway are necessary to induce specifically three of the eight COPs in an embryonic abdominal hemisegment. The cell-lineage analysis of COPs using the yeast flpase (flp/FRT) method indicated that each of the eight COPs originated from an individual undifferentiated ectodermal cell. The eight COPs in each abdominal hemisegment seemed to be determined by a two-phase induction: first, five COPs are determined by the action of the proneural gene atonal and neurogenic genes. Subsequently, these five COPs start to express the rho gene, and rho activates the DER-signaling pathway in neighboring cells and induces argos expression. Three of these argos-expressing cells differentiate into the three remaining COPs and they prevent neighboring cells from becoming extra COPs.",1997,"M Okabe, H Okano, M Okabe, H Okano"

Larval imaginal discs are enriched with MnSOD transcripts relative to other larval tissues, further suggesting a possible relationship between high MnSOD expression and mitotic activity. The 5'-upstream region contains several well-known regulatory elements including metal response, antioxidant response, and xenobiotic response elements (MRE, ARE, and XRE, respectively), sites for activator protein-1 (AP-1), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate regulator binding element factor (CREB), as well as classic TATA and CAAT boxes.

Y chromosome loops in Drosophila melanogaster,2465201,,"Primary spermatocyte nuclei of fixed testes of Drosophila melanogaster exhibit three large clusters of thread-like structures, each consisting of two long, continuous, loop-shaped filaments. No comparable intranuclear structures are observed in spermatogonia, secondary spermatocytes or spermatids. The threads begin to form in young spermatocytes, grow throughout spermatocyte development, reach their maximum size in mature spermatocytes and disintegrate prior to meiotic metaphase I. The presence of each cluster of threads depends upon the presence of a specific region of the Y chromosome; when this region is deleted the cluster is absent, and when it is duplicated the cluster is also duplicated. Together these observations strongly suggest that these structures represent giant Y chromosome lampbrush-like loops analogous to those described in Drosophila hydei. Two antibodies, one polyclonal and one monoclonal, differentially react with the three loops of D. melanogaster. Moreover, two of these loops are specifically stained by Giemsa at pH 10. By indirect immunofluorescence with these antibodies followed by Giemsa staining, each loop can be unambiguously identified and its presence and normality readily assessed. This enabled us to perform fine mapping experiments to determine the relationships between the Y chromosome fertility factors and the loops. The loop-forming sites map within the kl-5, kl-3 and ks-1 fertility factors. Regions h3 and h21 of the Y chromosome correspond to the loop-forming sites of kl-5 and ks-1, respectively. Each of these regions contains about 1300 kb of DNA and spans about one-third of its locus. The loop-forming site of the kl-3 locus is coextensive with region h7-h9 which contains about 4300 kb of DNA and corresponds to the minimum physical size of this locus. These data suggest that each loop is an integral part of a different fertility factor, representing the cytological manifestation of its activity in primary spermatocytes. The kl-2, kl-1 and ks-2 fertility regions do not produce any visible intranuclear structure and do not affect the kl-5, kl-3 and ks-1 loops. Thus, these loci may either not form loops at all or produce loop-like structures that we are unable to see because they are physically minute, destroyed by our fixation procedure, or both.",1988,"S Bonaccorsi, C Pisano, F Puoti, M Gatti, S Bonaccorsi, C Pisano, F Puoti, M Gatti"
An inducible promoter fused to the period gene in Drosophila conditionally rescues adult per-mutant arrhythmicity,3129662,10.1038/333082a0,"The period (per) gene of Drosophila melanogaster is involved in the expression of circadian rhythms of locomotor activity in adult flies. Molecular studies of per (reviewed in ref. 2) have shown that the transcribed and translated products of this gene are present primarily at the embryonic, pupal and adult stages. Here we describe experiments with arrhythmic per mutants bearing an inducible form of this gene which indicate that strongly rhythmic adult behaviour can be obtained only if per expression is induced in the adult, independent of its history of expression earlier in development. Thus per-mutant locomotor-activity phenotypes seem not to result from abnormalities in the development of neural structures or in physiological processes that may be required at pre-adult stages for the expression of this circadian rhythm. Moreover, the action of per after light:dark cycle entrainment seems to be sufficient for activity rhythms to be exhibited in constant darkness; this suggests further that the per product is required only during the time that the rhythmic behaviour is being manifested. Our strategy used a heat-shock gene promotor fused to per coding sequences to obtain conditional gene expression. Heat-shock promoter-driven genes have previously been used to study the mode of action and tissue specificity of a variety of Drosophila genes; our experiments on circadian rhythms demonstrate the use of such gene constructions for the temporal manipulation of genes whose phenotypes, behavioural and otherwise, affect whole organisms.",1988,"J Ewer, M Rosbash, J C Hall, J Ewer, M Rosbash, J C Hall"
ADAPTATIONS TO TEMPERATE CLIMATES AND EVOLUTION OF OVERWINTERING STRATEGIES IN THE DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER SPECIES GROUP,28581072,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1988.tb04188.x,"The Drosophila melanogaster species group is considered to have originated in the tropics and only recently invaded temperate habitats. The temperate species of this group that were studied here may be subdivided into the warm-temperate species (D. lutescens and D. rufa) and the cool-temperate species (species of the auraria complex). The warm-temperate species were more cold-hardy than were their tropical relatives (D. takahashii or D. melanogaster) at the larval and imaginal stages, and the cool-temperate species were more cold-hardy than the warm-temperate species, although only at the imaginal stage. However, these species showed little or no intraspecific variation in cold-hardiness, in spite of great variation in winter temperature within the species' ranges. It is assumed that cold-hardiness is one of the main factors restricting their distributions at high latitudes and that it is the key for evolution of the warm- and cool-temperate species from their subtropical or warm-temperate ancestors. Both warm- and cool-temperate species had photoperiodically controlled reproductive diapause. In the cool-temperate species, the development of cold-hardiness was affected by diapause, but diapause had little or no effect on cold-hardiness in the warm-temperate species. Critical daylengths and the diapause rates varied from species to species according to variation in their overwintering plans and also varied geographically in consequence of their adaptation to local climates. Species showed different responses to temperature in preimaginal and ovarian development. These differences are considered to reflect adaptation to different environmental temperatures.",1988,"Masahito T Kimura, Masahito T Kimura"
Naturally occurring variation in the restriction map of the amy region of Drosophila melanogaster,17246437,,The restriction maps of 85 alleles of the Amy region of Drosophila melanogaster from natural populations were surveyed. A subset of these were also scored for allozyme phenotype and adult enzyme activity of alpha-amylase. Large insertions were found in 12% of the alleles in a 15-kb region surrounding the two transcriptional units of the duplicated Amy locus. The low frequencies at which each of these large insertions were found are consistent with earlier reports of variation in other loci. Four small deletions were found in the region 5' to the Amy genes. Each was also rare in the population. Restriction site variation provided an estimate of per nucleotide heterozygosity of 0.006. Several statistically significant linkage disequilibria were observed between four polymorphic restriction sites and the allozymes. Adult alpha-amylase activity was correlated with the allozymes and with the polymorphism at one restriction site close to the transcriptional units.,1988,"C H Langley, A E Shrimpton, T Yamazaki, N Miyashita, Y Matsuo, C F Aquadro, C H Langley, A E Shrimpton, T Yamazaki, N Miyashita, Y Matsuo, C F Aquadro"

Taste sensitivity to trehalose and its alteration by gene dosage in Drosophila melanogaster,17246428,,"The taste sensitivity to the disaccharide trehalose of Drosophila melanogaster is under the genetic control by the Tre gene on the X chromosome. The gene is genetically dimorphic for high and low sensitivity and is likely to be functioning in the primary step of chemoreception. We have determined the cytological localization of the Tre gene to be between 5A10 and 5B1-3 by analyzing the sensitivity to trehalose in flies which are segmentally aneuploid bearing either deficiencies or duplicated fragments of T(X;Y) translocations. We also constructed flies which are aneuploidy and thus carry different dosage of Tre and/or Tre(+) alleles in order to examine the gene dosage effect on trehalose sensitivity and to deduce the nature of the gene's action. Trehalose sensitivity decreased in females carrying half the normal dosage of a given Tre allele, but a proportional increase in sensitivity was not observed in flies bearing a duplication of the Tre alleles. The changes in sensitivity in various aneuploid flies suggest that there is an upper limit to the number of molecules that can be incorporated into the receptor membrane. Genetic evidence strongly suggests that Tre is the structural gene for the trehalose receptor. We present a model to account for the mechanism of genetical control on the sensitivity to trehalose.",1988,"T Tanimura, K Isono, M T Yamamoto, T Tanimura, K Isono, M T Yamamoto"
Tissue specificity of hedgehog repression by the Polycomb group during Drosophila melanogaster development,16024236,10.1016/j.mod.2005.05.001,"During embryogenesis and wing disc morphogenesis in Drosophila, different developmental mechanisms are used along the antero-posterior (A-P) axis. The establishment of antero-posterior polarity requires the secreted protein Hedgehog, which is only expressed in P compartments and which is a key effector of the Engrailed transcription factor. At the same time, it is essential that both engrailed and hedgehog (hh) remain in a repressed state in A compartments. In this article, we show that hh is maintained in a repressed state by the Polycomb group (PcG) chromatin proteins. We show that this process takes place during embryogenesis through two genomic elements that display genetic properties of a PRE. Interestingly, hh expression is not regulated by PcG genes in salivary glands, although at the same developmental stage PcG proteins repress hh in the A compartment of the wing disc. In addition, no PcG binding sites were found on polytene chromosomes, neither within hh transgenic constructs nor at the hh endogenous locus. Together, these results suggest that hh repression by the PcG acts in a tissue-specific manner.",2005,"GrÃ©gory Chanas, Florence Maschat, GrÃ©gory Chanas, Florence Maschat"
Sequence signature analysis of chromosome identity in three Drosophila species,15975141,10.1186/1471-2105-6-158,"Background:
      
    

    
      All eukaryotic organisms need to distinguish each of their chromosomes. A few protein complexes have been described that recognise entire, specific chromosomes, for instance dosage compensation complexes and the recently discovered autosome-specific Painting of Fourth (POF) protein in Drosophila. However, no sequences have been found that are chromosome-specific and distributed over the entire length of the respective chromosome. Here, we present a new, unbiased, exhaustive computational method that was used to probe three Drosophila genomes for chromosome-specific sequences.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      By combining genome annotations and cytological data with multivariate statistics related to three Drosophila genomes we found sequence signatures that distinguish Muller's F-elements (chromosome 4 in D. melanogaster) from all other chromosomes in Drosophila that are not attributable to differences in nucleotide composition, simple sequence repeats or repeated elements. Based on these signatures we identified complex motifs that are strongly overrepresented in the F-elements and found indications that the D. melanogaster motif may be involved in POF-binding to the F-element. In addition, the X-chromosomes of D. melanogaster and D. yakuba can be distinguished from the other chromosomes, albeit to a lesser extent. Surprisingly, the conservation of the F-element sequence signatures extends not only between species separated by approximately 55 Myr, but also linearly along the sequenced part of the F-elements.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our results suggest that chromosome-distinguishing features are not exclusive to the sex chromosomes, but are also present on at least one autosome (the F-element) in Drosophila.",2005,"Per Stenberg, Fredrik Pettersson, Anja O Saura, Anders Berglund, Jan Larsson, Per Stenberg, Fredrik Pettersson, Anja O Saura, Anders Berglund, Jan Larsson"
Tarsus determination in Drosophila melanogaster,16094438,10.1139/g05-021,"Arista versus tarsus determination is well investigated in Drosophila, yet it remains unresolved whether Antennapedia (ANTP) cell autonomously or noncell autonomously determines tarsus identity and whether Sex combs reduced (SCR) is the HOX protein required for normal tarsus determination. Three observations rule out a cell autonomous role for ANTP in tarsus determination. (i) Clonal ectopic overexpression of ANTP did not repress the expression of the arista determining protein Homothorax (HTH) in early 3rd stadium antennal imaginal discs. (ii) Clonal ectopic expression of ANTP did not transform the arista to a tarsus. (iii) Ectopic overexpression of ANTP, Labial (LAB), Deformed (DFD), SCR, Ultrabithorax (UBX), Abdominal-A (ABD-A), or Abdominal-B (ABD-B), using the dppGAL4 driver, resulted in arista-to-tarsus transformations, and repressed HTH/Extradenticle (EXD) activity noncell autonomously in early 3rd stadium antennal imaginal discs. SCR may not be the HOX protein required for normal tarsus determination, because co-ectopic expression of Proboscipedia (PB) inhibited the arista-to-tarsus transformations induced by ectopic expression of DFD, SCR, ANTP, UBX, ABD-A, and ABD-B. The proposal that SCR is the HOX protein required for normal tarsus determination is dependent on SCR being the sole target of PB suppression, which is not the case. Therefore, the possibility exists that normal tarsus determination is HOX independent.",2005,"Anthony Percival-Smith, Wendy A Teft, Jodi Lynn Barta, Anthony Percival-Smith, Wendy A Teft, Jodi Lynn Barta"

Correlations of life-span variation parameters in 128 successive generations of Drosophila melanogaster with changes in atmospheric pressure and geomagnetic activity,15864403,10.1007/s00484-004-0243-1,"Correlations between the parameters of life-span (LS) distribution of Drosophila melanogaster, including mean LS (MLS) and the time of 10 and 90% population mortality, and some geophysical parameters that are usually beyond the control of researchers dealing with laboratory cultures, including atmospheric pressure, solar activity indices (Wolf's sunspot numbers and 2,800-MHz radio flux), and geomagnetic activity (planetary index, K(p)), were studied.

Wolbachia utilizes host microtubules and Dynein for anterior localization in the Drosophila oocyte,16228015,10.1371/journal.ppat.0010014,"To investigate the role of the host cytoskeleton in the maternal transmission of the endoparasitic bacteria Wolbachia, we have characterized their distribution in the female germ line of Drosophila melanogaster. In the germarium, Wolbachia are distributed to all germ cells of the cyst, establishing an early infection in the cell destined to become the oocyte. During mid-oogenesis, Wolbachia exhibit a distinct concentration between the anterior cortex and the nucleus in the oocyte, where many bacteria appear to contact the nuclear envelope. Following programmed rearrangement of the microtubule network, Wolbachia dissociate from this anterior position and become dispersed throughout the oocyte. This localization pattern is distinct from mitochondria and all known axis determinants. Manipulation of microtubules and cytoplasmic Dynein and Dynactin, but not Kinesin-1, disrupts anterior bacterial localization in the oocyte. In live egg chambers, Wolbachia exhibit movement in nurse cells but not in the oocyte, suggesting that the bacteria are anchored by host factors. In addition, we identify mid-oogenesis as a period in the life cycle of Wolbachia in which bacterial replication occurs. Total bacterial counts show that Wolbachia increase at a significantly higher rate in the oocyte than in the average nurse cell, and that normal Wolbachia levels in the oocyte depend on microtubules. These findings demonstrate that Wolbachia utilize the host microtubule network and associated proteins for their subcellular localization in the Drosophila oocyte. These interactions may also play a role in bacterial motility and replication, ultimately leading to the bacteria's efficient maternal transmission.",2005,"Patrick M Ferree, Horacio M Frydman, Jennifer M Li, Jian Cao, Eric Wieschaus, William Sullivan, Patrick M Ferree, Horacio M Frydman, Jennifer M Li, Jian Cao, Eric Wieschaus, William Sullivan"
The relationship between life span and adult body size is highly strain-specific in Drosophila melanogaster,15919589,10.1016/j.exger.2005.02.004,"Among mammals, body size and life span tend to vary inversely within species, but the pattern is less clear in invertebrates. Here, we report on survival and weight of male flies from 29 laboratory strains of Drosophila melanogaster. Natural variation in body mass was enhanced by rearing larvae under normal and limited food conditions. Strain, weight, and larval treatment have significant effects on survival, but higher order interactions are also significant, indicating strain specificity. For pooled data the overall relationship between mass and life span is slight, positive, and statistically significant, but mass explains < or =1% of the variation in survival. This result is opposite to the common prediction of an inverse relationship between longevity and body size. Effects of artificially reduced body size vary substantially in both sign and magnitude from strain to strain, though long-lived strains generally retain their enhanced survival characteristics. Within-line regressions of life span on mass also vary dramatically from strain to strain; in Canton-S, the most extreme case, mass explains >40% of the variation in survival. For long-lived 'O' lines reared under normal larval conditions, smaller flies live 16% longer than larger flies; the latter are significantly underrepresented in the most advanced age class. We conclude that the body size-life span relationship is highly strain-specific; that inconsistencies in the literature probably reflect real biological variation; and that variation in body size can be a significant source of experimental noise in survival studies.",2005,"Aziz A Khazaeli, Wayne Van Voorhies, James W Curtsinger, Aziz A Khazaeli, Wayne Van Voorhies, James W Curtsinger"

In some cases, cell-surface expression of classical nuclear steroid receptors has been suggested to mediate these effects, but, in a few instances, specific G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been reported to be responsible. Here, we describe the activation of a novel, neuronally expressed Drosophila GPCR by the insect ecdysteroids ecdysone (E) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). This is the first report of an identified insect GPCR interacting with steroids. The Drosophila melanogaster dopamine/ecdysteroid receptor (DmDopEcR) shows sequence homology with vertebrate beta-adrenergic receptors and is activated by dopamine (DA) to increase cAMP levels and to activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway. Conversely, E and 20E show high affinity for the receptor in binding studies and can inhibit the effects of DA, as well as coupling the receptor to a rapid activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The receptor may thus represent the Drosophila homolog of the vertebrate ""gamma-adrenergic receptors,"" which are responsible for the modulation of various activities in brain, blood vessels, and pancreas. Thus, DmDopEcR can function as a cell-surface GPCR that may be responsible for some of the rapid, nongenomic actions of ecdysteroids, during both development and signaling in the mature adult nervous system.",2005,"Deepak P Srivastava, Esther J Yu, Karen Kennedy, Heather Chatwin, Vincenzina Reale, Maureen Hamon, Trevor Smith, Peter D Evans, Deepak P Srivastava, Esther J Yu, Karen Kennedy, Heather Chatwin, Vincenzina Reale, Maureen Hamon, Trevor Smith, Peter D Evans"

Superoxide dismutase evolution and life span regulation,15664623,10.1016/j.mad.2004.08.012,"Superoxide is among the most abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the mitochondria, and is involved in cellular signaling pathways. Superoxide and other ROS can damage cellular macromolecules and levels of oxidative damage products are positively correlated with aging. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes catalyze the breakdown of superoxide into hydrogen peroxide and water and are therefore central regulators of ROS levels. Genetic and transgenic manipulation of SOD activities in model systems such as S. cereviseae, mouse and Drosophila are consistent with a central role for SOD enzymes in regulating oxidative stress resistance. Over-expression of SOD in S. cereviseae and Drosophila can reduce oxidative damage and extend life span, but the mechanism(s) are not yet clear. A phylogenetic analysis of publicly available SOD protein sequences suggests several additional conserved gene families. For example, in addition to the well-characterized soluble Cu/Zn enzyme (Sod) and mitochondrial manganese-containing form (Sod2), Drosophila melanogaster is found to contain a putative copper chaperone (CCS), an extracellular Cu/Zn enzyme (Sod3), and an extracellular protein distantly related to the Cu/Zn forms (Sodq). C. elegans and blue crab are unusual in having two Mn-containing SODs, and A. gambiae contains an unusual internally repeated SOD.

We have identified several P-element insertions into this retrotransposon array and compared expression levels of transgenes with similar integrations into TAS and euchromatic regions. In contrast to insertions in TAS, which are silenced, reporter genes in the terminal HeT-A, TAHRE, or TART retroelements did not exhibit repressed expression in comparison with the same transgene construct in euchromatin.

Sap18 is required for the maternal gene bicoid to direct anterior patterning in Drosophila melanogaster,15649476,10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.11.011,"Development of the insect head is a complex process that in Drosophila requires the anterior determinant, Bicoid. Bicoid is present in an anterior-to-posterior concentration gradient, and binds DNA and stimulates transcription of head-specific genes. Many of these genes, including the gap-gene hunchback, are initially activated in a broad domain across the head primordium, but later retract so that their expression is cleared from the anterior-most segmented regions. Here, we show that retraction requires a Bicoid-interacting protein, Sap18, which is part of the Sin3/Rpd3 histone deacetylase complex. In sensitized-mutant backgrounds (e.g., bcdE1/+, removal of maternal sap18 results in embryos that are missing labrally derived parts of the cephalopharyngeal skeleton. These sap18 mutant embryos fail to repress hb expression, and show reduced anterior cap expression of the labral determinant cap 'n' collar. These phenotypes are enhanced by lowering the dose of rpd3, which encodes the catalytic subunit of the deacetylase complex. The results suggest a model where, in labral regions of the head, Bicoid is converted from an activator into a repressor by recruitment of a co-repressor to Bicoid-dependent promoters. Bicoid's activity, therefore, depends not only on its concentration gradient, but also on its interactions with modifier proteins within spatially restricted domains.",2005,"Navjot Singh, Wencheng Zhu, Steven D Hanes, Navjot Singh, Wencheng Zhu, Steven D Hanes"

Proteome profiling for assessing diversity: analysis of individual heads of Drosophila melanogaster using LC-ion mobility-MS,16083273,10.1021/pr050037o,"The proteomes of three heads of individual Drosophila melanogaster organisms have been analyzed and compared by a combination of liquid chromatography, ion mobility spectrometry, and mass spectrometry approaches. In total, 197 proteins are identified among all three individuals (an average of 120 +/- 20 proteins per individual), of which at least 101 proteins are present in all three individuals. Within all three datasets, more than 25 000 molecular ions (an average of 9000 +/- 2000 per individual) corresponding to protonated precursor ions of individual peptides have been observed. A comparison of peaks among the datasets reveals that peaks corresponding to protonated peptides that are found in all heads are more intense than those features that appear between pairs of or within only one of the individuals.

A genetic screen for dominant modifiers of a small-wing phenotype in Drosophila melanogaster identifies proteins involved in splicing and translation,15998720,10.1534/genetics.105.045021,"Studies in the fly, Drosophila melanogaster, have revealed that several signaling pathways are important for the regulation of growth. Among these, the insulin receptor/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is remarkable in that it affects growth and final size without disturbing pattern formation. We have used a small-wing phenotype, generated by misexpression of kinase-dead PI3K, to screen for novel mutations that specifically disrupt organ growth in vivo. We identified several complementation groups that dominantly enhance this small-wing phenotype. Meiotic recombination in conjunction with visible markers and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was used to map five enhancers to single genes. Two of these, nucampholin and prp8, encode pre-mRNA splicing factors. The three other enhancers encode factors required for mRNA translation: pixie encodes the Drosophila ortholog of yeast RLI1, and RpL5 and RpL38 encode proteins of the large ribosomal subunit. Interestingly, mutations in several other ribosomal protein-encoding genes also enhance the small-wing phenotype used in the original screen. Our work has therefore identified mutations in five previously uncharacterized Drosophila genes and provides in vivo evidence that normal organ growth requires optimal regulation of both pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA translation.",2005,"Carmen M A Coelho, Benjamin Kolevski, Cherryl D Walker, Irene Lavagi, Thomas Shaw, Anselm Ebert, Sally J Leevers, Steven J Marygold, Carmen M A Coelho, Benjamin Kolevski, Cherryl D Walker, Irene Lavagi, Thomas Shaw, Anselm Ebert, Sally J Leevers, Steven J Marygold"
Multilocus patterns of nucleotide variability and the demographic and selection history of Drosophila melanogaster populations,15930491,10.1101/gr.3541005,"Uncertainty about the demographic history of populations can hamper genome-wide scans for selection based on population genetic models. To obtain a portrait of the effects of demographic history on genome variability patterns in Drosophila melanogaster populations, we surveyed noncoding DNA polymorphism at 10 X-linked loci in large samples from three African and two non-African populations. All five populations show significant departures from expectations under the standard neutral model. We detect weak but significant differentiation between East (Kenya and Zimbabwe) and West/Central sub-Saharan (Gabon) African populations. A skew toward high-frequency-derived polymorphisms, elevated levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and significant heterogeneity in levels of polymorphism and divergence in the Gabon sample suggest that this population is further from mutation-drift equilibrium than the two Eastern African populations. Both non-African populations harbor significantly higher levels of LD, a large excess of high-frequency-derived mutations and extreme heterogeneity among loci in levels of polymorphism and divergence. Rejections of the neutral model in D. melanogaster populations using these and similar features have been interpreted as evidence for an important role for natural selection in shaping genome variability patterns. Based on simulations, we conclude that simple bottleneck models are sufficient to account for most, if not all, polymorphism features of both African and non-African populations. In contrast, we show that a steady-state recurrent hitchhiking model fails to account for several aspects of the data. Demographic departures from equilibrium expectations in both ancestral and derived populations thus represent a serious challenge to detecting positive selection in genome-wide scans using current methodologies.",2005,"Penelope R Haddrill, Kevin R Thornton, Brian Charlesworth, Peter Andolfatto, Penelope R Haddrill, Kevin R Thornton, Brian Charlesworth, Peter Andolfatto"
Differing strategies of patterning of follicular cells in higher and lower brachycerans (Diptera: Brachycera),16100706,10.1002/gene.20155,"In all higher dipterans (Brachycera), including the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, each egg chamber (ovarian follicle) consists of a group (clone) of germ cells (one oocyte and 15 accompanying nurse cells) that is surrounded by a layer of somatic mesodermal follicular cells (FCs). As oogenesis progresses the initially uniform FCs diversify into several morphologically and functionally distinct subpopulations. In D. melanogaster some of these subpopulations, e.g., border, centripetal, and dorsolateral cells, undertake coordinated migration or rearrangement over the surface of the germ cells. During the final stages of oogenesis these subpopulations participate in the formation of a complex, regionally specialized eggshell. In representatives of lower brachycerans (Orthorrhapha), only FCs that undertake active, directed migration are the border cells. These cells originate at the anterior pole of the ovarian follicle and migrate between the nurse cells to the anterior pole of the oocyte. Reduced motility of FCs in lower brachycerans results in the absence of certain FC subpopulations in their egg chambers and subsequent simplicity of their eggshells. We found that the lack of some FC subpopulations coincided with the appearance of lamellipodium-like protrusions of the oocyte. These protrusions penetrated between the apposing membranes of nurse and FCs and partially enveloped the nurse cell compartment. Analysis of whole-mount preparations stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin revealed that the protrusions contained microfilaments and that their tips were equipped with actin-rich filopodium-like processes. We also found that in some lower brachycerans (representatives of the family Rhagionidae), the FCs located at the posterior pole of the oocyte, became enlarged and morphologically similar to the anterior border cells. These findings indicate that in higher dipterans the processes leading to the formation of a functional egg are variable and often markedly different from those in the model organism, D. melanogaster.",2005,"Waclaw Tworzydlo, Anna Jablonska, Elzbieta Kisiel, Szczepan M Bilinski, Waclaw Tworzydlo, Anna Jablonska, Elzbieta Kisiel, Szczepan M Bilinski"
Codon bias and noncoding GC content correlate negatively with recombination rate on the Drosophila X chromosome,16044248,10.1007/s00239-004-0287-1,"The patterns and processes of molecular evolution may differ between the X chromosome and the autosomes in Drosophila melanogaster.

These and other factors may lead to differences both in the gene complements of the X and the autosomes and in the properties of the genes residing on those chromosomes. Here we show that codon bias and recombination rate are correlated strongly and negatively on the X chromosome, and that this correlation cannot be explained by indirect relationships with other known determinants of codon bias. This is in dramatic contrast to the weak positive correlation found on the autosomes. We explored possible explanations for these patterns, which required a comprehensive analysis of the relationships among multiple genetic properties such as protein length and expression level. This analysis highlights conserved features of coding sequence evolution on the X and the autosomes and illuminates interesting differences between these two chromosome sets.",2005,"Nadia D Singh, Jerel C Davis, Dmitri A Petrov, Nadia D Singh, Jerel C Davis, Dmitri A Petrov"

Using simulated data, we show that the power of the tests lies between 80 and 98% in most cases, and the false positive rate could be as low as approximately 10% when the number of sampled marker loci is sufficiently large (> or = 20). The confidence interval around the estimated position of selection is reasonably narrow. The methods are applied to X chromosome data of Drosophila melanogaster from a European and an African population.

Among the clock genes described thus far, CK2 is unique in its involvement in plant, fungal, as well as animal circadian clocks. We propose that this reflects an ancient, conserved function for CK2 in circadian clocks. CK2 and other clock genes have been implicated in cellular responses to DNA damage, particularly those induced by ultraviolet (UV) light. The finding of a dual function of CK2 in clocks and in UV responses supports the notion that clocks evolved to assist organisms in avoiding the mutagenic effects of daily sunlight.",2005,"Ravi Allada, Rose-Anne Meissner, Ravi Allada, Rose-Anne Meissner"

We further characterized the involvement of prolyl 4-hydroxylase in the assembly of the three alpha chains to form trimeric type XXI minicollagen, which comprises the intact C-terminal non-collagenous (NC1) and collagenous domain (COL1), in the Drosophila system. When minicollagen XXI was stably expressed in Drosophila S2 cells alone, negligible amounts of interchain disulfide-bonded trimers were detected in the culture media. However, minicollagen XXI was secreted as disulfide-bonded homotrimers by coexpression with prolyl 4-hydroxylase in the stably transfected Drosophila S2 cells. Minicollagen XXI coexpressed with prolyl 4-hydroxylase contained sufficient amounts of hydroxyproline to form thermal stable pepsin-resistant triple helices consisting of both interchain and non-interchain disulfide-bonded trimers.

A family of octopamine [corrected] receptors that specifically induce cyclic AMP production or Ca2+ release in Drosophila melanogaster,15816867,10.1111/j.1471-4159.2005.03034.x,"In invertebrates, the biogenic-amine octopamine is an important physiological regulator. It controls and modulates neuronal development, circadian rhythm, locomotion, 'fight or flight' responses, as well as learning and memory. Octopamine mediates its effects by activation of different GTP-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor types, which induce either cAMP production or Ca(2+) release. Here we describe the functional characterization of two genes from Drosophila melanogaster that encode three octopamine receptors. The first gene (Dmoa1) codes for two polypeptides that are generated by alternative splicing. When heterologously expressed, both receptors cause oscillatory increases of the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration in response to applying nanomolar concentrations of octopamine. The second gene (Dmoa2) codes for a receptor that specifically activates adenylate cyclase and causes a rise of intracellular cAMP with an EC(50) of approximately 3 x 10(-8) m octopamine. Tyramine, the precursor of octopamine biosynthesis, activates all three receptors at > or = 100-fold higher concentrations, whereas dopamine and serotonin are non-effective. Developmental expression of Dmoa genes was assessed by RT-PCR. Overlapping but not identical expression patterns were observed for the individual transcripts.

Calorie restriction delays lipid oxidative damage in Drosophila melanogaster,16026335,10.1111/j.1474-9726.2005.00159.x,"The oxidative stress hypothesis predicts that the accumulation of oxidative damage to a variety of macromolecules is the molecular trigger driving the process of aging. Although an inverse relationship between oxidative damage and lifespan has been established in several different species, the precise relationship between oxidative damage and aging is not fully understood. Drosophila melanogaster is a favored model organism for aging research. Environmental interventions such as ambient temperature and calorie restriction can alter adult lifespan to provide an excellent system to examine the relationship between oxidative damage, aging and lifespan. We have developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using commercially available reagents for measuring 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) in proteins, a marker for oxidative damage to lipids, and present data in flies to show that HNE adducts accumulate in an age-dependent manner. With immunohistology, we also find the primary site of HNE accumulation is the pericerebral fat body, where induction of dFOXO was recently shown to retard aging. When subjected to environmental interventions that shorten lifespan, such as elevated ambient temperature, the chronological accumulation of HNE adduct is accelerated. Conversely, interventions that extend lifespan, such as lower ambient temperature or low calorie diets, slow the accumulation of HNE adduct. These studies associate damage from lipid peroxidation with aging and lifespan in Drosophila and show that calorie restriction in flies, as in mammals, slows the accumulation of lipid related oxidative damage.",2005,"Jianyu Zheng, Raye Mutcherson 2nd, Stephen L Helfand, Jianyu Zheng, Raye Mutcherson 2nd, Stephen L Helfand"

Coherent sets of genes with similar function often bear the same conserved elements, providing new insights into their cellular functions. We also show that target sites for distinct miRNAs are often simultaneously conserved, suggesting combinatorial regulation by multiple miRNAs.

The multiple variants of DMIH coded by a single gene thus might form the molecular basis for a variety of I(h)-channels. Functional expression of one of the DMIH variants with a long N-terminus in HEK293 cells produced unitary currents that were preferentially selective for potassium over sodium ions and were activated by hyperpolarizing voltage steps.

In the absence of Mod(mdg4)2.2, nuclear clustering of insulator complexes is disrupted and insulator activity is compromised. Overexpression of dTopors in the mod(mdg4)2.2 null mutant rescues insulator activity and restores the formation of nuclear insulator bodies. dTopors associates with the nuclear lamina, and mutations in lamin disrupt dTopors localization as well as nuclear organization and activity of the gypsy insulator.

These differences in mating propensity, in turn, can give rise to statistically significant results in multiple-choice mating tests, leading to positive isolation values and the artifactual inference of sexual isolation between populations. This fact agrees with a nonrandom excess of significant positive tests found in a review of the literature of Drosophila intraspecific mating choice.

The Y chromosome as a target for acquired and amplified genetic material in evolution,16299764,10.1002/bies.20321,"The special properties of the Y chromosome stem form the fact that it is a non-recombining degenerate derivative of the X chromosome. The absence of homologous recombination between the X and the Y chromosome leads to gradual degeneration of various Y chromosome genes on an evolutionary timescale.

Alongside these processes, the acquisition and amplification of autosomal male benefit genes occur. This review will focus on recent studies that reveal the autosome-acquired genes on the Y chromosome of both Drosophila and humans. The evolution of the acquired and amplified genes on the Y chromosome is also discussed. Molecular and comparative analyses of Y-linked repeats in the Drosophila melanogaster genome demonstrate that there was a period of their degeneration followed by a period of their integration into RNAi silencing, which was beneficial for male fertility.

During cellularization, the actomyosin cytoskeleton forms a hexagonal array and drives invagination of the plasma membrane between the nuclei located at the cortex of the syncytial blastoderm. Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 proteins are members of the Rho subfamily of Ras-related G proteins that are involved in the formation and maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton throughout phylogeny and in D. melanogaster. To investigate how Rho subfamily activity affects the cytoskeleton during cellularization stages, embryos were microinjected with C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum or with wild-type, constitutively active, or dominant negative versions of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 proteins. C3 exoenzyme ADP-ribosylates and inactivates Rho with high specificity, whereas constitutively active dominant mutations remain in the activated GTP-bound state to activate downstream effectors. Dominant negative mutations likely inhibit endogenous small G protein activity by sequestering exchange factors. Of the 10 agents microinjected, C3 exoenzyme, constitutively active Cdc42, and dominant negative Rho have a specific and indistinguishable effect: the actomyosin cytoskeleton is disrupted, cellularization halts, and embryogenesis arrests. Time-lapse video records of DIC imaged embryos show that nuclei in injected regions move away from the cortex of the embryo, thereby phenocopying injections of cytochalasin or antimyosin. Rhodamine phalloidin staining reveals that the actin-based hexagonal array normally seen during cellularization is disrupted in a dose-dependent fashion. Additionally, DNA stain reveals that nuclei in the microinjected embryos aggregate in regions that correspond to actin disruption. These embryos halt in cellularization and do not proceed to gastrulation. We conclude that Rho activity and Cdc42 regulation are required for cytoskeletal function in actomyosin-driven furrow canal formation and nuclear positioning.",1998,"J M Crawford, N Harden, T Leung, L Lim, D P Kiehart, J M Crawford, N Harden, T Leung, L Lim, D P Kiehart"
The evolutionary history of Drosophila buzzatii. XXXIV. The distribution of the retrotransposon Osvaldo in original and colonizing populations,12572617,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025881,"The frequency distribution of the retrotransposon Osvaldo in the haploid genome of Drosophila buzzatii has been studied in five natural populations from the Iberian Peninsula and six natural populations from Argentina. In Iberian populations, Osvaldo insertion sites do not follow a Poisson distribution, most probably due to eight euchromatic sites with high occupancy, found in all populations. The estimated alpha and beta parameters, which measure the relative importance of drift and negative selection in shaping frequency distributions, indicate that drift is the main force acting upon the distribution of Osvaldo in natural populations of D. buzzatii in the Iberian Peninsula. On the other hand, Osvaldo distribution in populations from Argentina is similar to the distribution of elements with low copy numbers, such as those described for Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans: there are no indications for deviation from a Poisson distribution, there is a low occupancy per insertion site, and genetic drift has no apparent effect on the frequency distribution. We propose that the unusual distribution found in the populations from the Iberian Peninsula is a consequence of the colonization process. Iberian Peninsula populations suffered a genomic redistribution of Osvaldo, most probably after a founder effect. Consequently, certain copies that arrived at high frequencies are showing a high occupancies today, and the mean copy number of Osvaldo is higher in Iberian Peninsula populations than in populations from Argentina. All other copies are the result of recent (after colonization) transposition events.",1998,"M Labrador, M C Seleme, A Fontdevila, M Labrador, M C Seleme, A Fontdevila"
Ecdysteroids regulate yolk protein uptake by Drosophila melanogaster oocytes,12769946,10.1016/s0022-1910(98)00020-1,"Juvenile hormones (JHs) are thought to drive the regulation of yolk protein uptake by ovaries in Drosophila melanogaster. However, the level of JH production in a mutant stock (ap(56f)) is depressed yet the flies are normally vitellogenic. The production of ecdysteroids by these ap(56f) ovaries in vitro is elevated above that of wild-type ovaries. The incubation of wild-type ovaries in the presence of 0.1mM JHB(3) increased ecdysteroid biosynthesis only during the first 18h following eclosion. Female Drosophila melanogaster undergo a pre-vitellogenic reproductive diapause when exposed to low temperature (11 degrees C) and a short-day photoperiod (L12:D12). The rate of ecdysteroid synthesis by the ovaries, but not JH production, increased within 12h of a temperature upshift to 25 degrees C from a basal level of 20+/-1pg/10 pair of ovaries/5h to a sustained level of 150+/-20pg/10 pair/5h. Vitellogenic oocytes were noted in all females within 12h of this temperature upshift. Diapause was also terminated by the injection of 1&mgr;g of 20-hydroxyecdysone into the abdomens of diapausing females as determined by an increase in ovary size, and the appearance of vitellogenic oocytes as compared to controls. These results are consistent with a revised model for the regulation of yolk protein uptake by ovaries in which ecdysteroids, and not JHs, play the prominent role.",1998,"L I. Gilbert, R B.

Genetic damage induced by methylglyoxal and methylglyoxal plus X-rays in Drosophila melanogaster germinal cells,9748492,10.1016/s0027-5107(98)00152-3,"The effect of methylglyoxal (MG) and MG administered prior to X-irradiation was investigated in Drosophila melanogaster germinal cells using the sex-linked recessive lethal (s.l.r.l.), II-III autosomal translocation (AT) and X-chromosome nondisjunction (ND) tests. For the s.l.r.l. test the males were either injected with MG (0.5 M, 0.75 M or 1.7 M) or fed for 24 h (1 M) and two 24 h broods (A and B) were obtained. For the AT test the males were injected with MG 1.7 M and the same brooding scheme was followed. ND was tested in females fed on MG 1 M. The only effect observed after MG treatment was a significant increase on the yield of s.l.r.l. with MG 1.7 M. In the combined treatments MG was administered prior to irradiation with 20 Gy of X-rays and the induction of s.l.r.l. and AT was assessed. Pre-treatment with MG 0.75 M and 1.7 M enhanced the frequency of s.l.r.l. in cells sampled in brood B, consisting mainly of the rather hypoxic late spermatids. It is suggested that this radiosensitizing effect could be ascribed to a decrease in the level of glutathione due to the metabolization of MG.",1998,"B M Barnett, E R MuÃ±oz, B M Barnett, E R MuÃ±oz"
The Nop60B gene of Drosophila encodes an essential nucleolar protein that functions in yeast,9829824,10.1007/s004380050866,"The Cbf5 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was originally identified as a low-affinity centromeric DNA-binding protein, and chf5 mutants have a defect in rRNA synthesis. A closely related protein from mammals, NAP57, is a nucleolar protein that coimmunoprecipitates with the nucleolar phosphoprotein Nopp140. To study the function of this protein family in a higher eukaryote that is amenable to genetic approaches, the gene encoding a Drosophila melanogaster homolog, Nop60B, was identified. The predicted Drosophila protein shares a high degree of sequence identity over a 380-residue region with both the mammalian and yeast proteins, and shares several conserved motifs with the prokaryotic tRNA pseudouridine 55 synthases. Nop60B RNA is found at high levels in nurse cells and in the oocyte, and is present throughout development. Nop60B protein is localized primarily to the nucleolus of interphase cells, and is absent from the chromosomes during mitosis. Nop60B mutants were generated and shown to be homozygous lethal. The Drosophila gene can rescue the lethal phenotype of yeast chf5 mutations, showing that the function of this protein has been conserved from yeast to Drosophila.",1998,"B Phillips, A N Billin, C Cadwell, R Buchholz, C Erickson, J R Merriam, J Carbon, S J Poole, B Phillips, A N Billin, C Cadwell, R Buchholz, C Erickson, J R Merriam, J Carbon, S J Poole"

Molecular identification of the active ninja retrotransposon and the inactive aurora element in Drosophila simulans and D. melanogaster,10333568,10.1266/ggs.73.385,"How transposable elements evolve is a key facet in understanding of spontaneous mutation and genomic rearrangements in various organisms. One of the best ways to approach this question is to study a newly evolved transposable element whose presence is restricted to a specific population or strain. The retrotransposons ninja and aurora may provide insights into the process of their evolution, because of their contrasting characteristics, even though they show high sequence identity. The ninja retrotransposon was found in a Drosophila simulans strain in high copy number and is potent in transposition. On the other hand, aurora elements are distributed widely among the species belonging to the Drosophila melanogaster species complex, but are immobile at least in D. melanogaster. In order to distinguish the two closely resembled retrotransposons by molecular means, we determined and compared DNA sequence of the elements, and identified characteristic internal deletions and nucleotide substitutions in 5'-long terminal repeats (LTR). Analyses of the structure of ninja homologs and LTR sequences amplified from both genomic and cloned DNA revealed that the actively transposable ninja elements were present only in D. simulans strains, but inactive aurora elements exist in both D. melanogaster and D. simulans.",1998,"Y Kanamori, H Hayashi, M T Yamamoto"
Genetic mapping of the amide response element(s) of the hsr omega locus of Drosophila melanogaster,9601981,10.1007/s004120050288,"Small chromosomal deletions [Df(3R)eR-1 and Df(3R)eP] with intact hsromega transcription units but with variable deletions of the upstream region were used to map the upstream regions that regulate heat shock and amide responsivity of the 93D puff (hsromega locus) in salivary glands of late third instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster. The Df(3R)eP deletion, generated by a P-element mobilization screen, removed the 93B6-7 to 93D3-5 cytogenetic region. [3H]uridine-labeled transcription autoradiograms revealed that normal developmental and heat shock-induced expression of the 93D puff remained unaffected in both the deficiency chromosomes. However, the amide responsivity of the 93D site was lost on the Df(3R)eP homolog while the Df(3R)eR-1 homolog responded normally to amides. Southern hybridizations with a series of upstream probes mapped the distal breakpoint of the Df(3R)eP deletion between -22 kb and -23 kb of the hsromega transcription unit. Since the distal breakpoint of Df(3R)eR-1 is at about -45 kb upstream of the hsromega gene it is inferred that the amide response element(s) that modulate the specific transcriptional activation of the 93D puff following treatment of salivary glands with a variety of amides is/are located in the -22 kb to about -45 kb upstream interval. The Df(3R)eP and Df(3R)eR-1 deletions also abolished dosage compensation at the 93D locus as well as the effect of beta-alanine levels on its heat shock inducibility.",1998,"S C Lakhotia, M G Tapadia, S C Lakhotia, M G Tapadia"
Imprinted control of gene activity in Drosophila,9822579,10.1016/s0960-9822(07)00537-4,"Genetic imprinting is defined as a reversible, differential marking of genes or chromosomes that is determined by the sex of the parent from whom the genetic material is inherited [1]. Imprinting was first observed in insects where, in some species, most notably among the coccoids (scale insects and allies), the differential marking of paternally and maternally transmitted chromosome sets leads to inactivation or elimination of paternal chromosomes [2]. Imprinting is also widespread in plants and mammals [3,4], in which paternally and maternally inherited alleles may be differentially expressed. Despite imprinting having been discovered in insects, clear examples of parental imprinting are scarce in the model insect species Drosophila melanogaster. We describe a case of imprint-mediated control of gene expression in Drosophila. The imprinted gene - the white+ eye-color gene - is expressed at a low level when transmitted by males, and at a high level when transmitted by females. Thus, in common with coccoids, Drosophila is capable of generating an imprint, and can respond to that imprint by silencing the paternal allele.",1998,"K G Golic, M M Golic, S Pimpinelli, K G Golic, M M Golic, S Pimpinelli"

The period gene controls courtship song cycles in Drosophila melanogaster,9710465,10.1006/anbe.1998.0743,"We developed a technique that assists in objective identification of pulse and sine components in the Drosophila melanogaster courtship song. The song was recorded digitally and subjected to wavelet analysis, which decomposed the signal into a series of bands of decreasing frequency in which acoustic power appeared as a function of time. This time-frequency analysis expresses characteristic 'fingerprints' of the pulses, which appear in all frequency bands, and characteristic 'fingerprints' of the sine song, which appear only in the band containing its frequency. Means of the interpulse intervals (IPIs) for each second of 10-min recordings of song in which pulse singing occurred constituted an irregularly sampled time series, intractable to common spectral analysis techniques. Therefore, we took the discrete Fourier transform of this series, which retained all the spectral information in the Fourier coefficients, and used the inverse Fourier transform of these coefficients to yield a new series that was regularly spaced, with an estimate of IPI for each second in the interval. We observed an IPI period of 67.9 s in wild type, 31.1 s in per0, 45.9 s in pers, and 72.0 s in perL.

Sequence and expression pattern of the Drosophila melanogaster mitochondrial porin gene: evidence of a conserved protein domain between fly and mouse,9688565,10.1016/s0014-5793(98)00693-0,"We have recently cloned a cDNA encoding mitochondrial porin in Drosophila melanogaster and shown its chromosomal localization (Messina et al., FEBS Lett. (1996) 384, 9-13). Such cDNA was used as a probe for screening a genomic library. We thus cloned and sequenced a 4494-bp genomic region which contained the whole gene for the mitochondrial porin or VDAC. It was found that this D. melanogaster porin gene contains five exons, numbered IA (115 bp), IB (123 bp), II (320 bp), III (228 bp) and IV (752 bp). The exons II, III and IV contain the protein coding sequence and the 3' untranslated sequence (3'-UTR). The first base in exon II precisely corresponds to the first base of the starting ATG codon. Exon IA corresponds to the 5'-UTR sequence reported in the published cDNA sequence. Exon IB corresponds to an alternative 5'-UTR sequence, demonstrated to be transcribed by 5'-RACE experiments. The exon-intron splicing borders and the length of the exon III perfectly match a homologous internal exon detected in the mouse genes. Such exon encodes a protein domain predicted by sequence transmembrane arrangement models to contain major hydrophilic loops and it is thus suspected to have a conserved distinct function. In situ hybridization experiments confirmed the localization of the genomic clone on the chromosome 2L at region 32B3-4. Together with genomic Southern blotting at various stringencies, the same experiment did not confirm the presence of a second genetic locus on D. melanogaster chromosomes. Northern blots demonstrated that the porin gene is a housekeeping one: three messages of approx. 1.2-1.6 kbp are transcribed in every fly developmental stage that was studied. They were shown to derive by an alternative usage of different promoters and polyadenylation sites.",1998,"M Oliva, A Messina, G Ragone, C Caggese, V De Pinto, M Oliva, A Messina, G Ragone, C Caggese, V De Pinto"
Developmental anatomy of the Drosophila brain: neuroanatomy is gene expression,9831042,,"On-line databases of anatomical information are being compiled for a number of genetically manipulable organisms, including the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Based on the success of the molecular databases that preceded them, they face formidable problems in data cataloguing, storage, and retrieval. The prospect for such databases, which is apparent already, is to alter permanently the approach to neuroanatomy in such species. Experience with Drosophila indicates the possibility to arbitrate controversies over and, in some cases, to redefine the borders drawn in the brain by conventional neuroanatomical methods. Two publications in this issue of Journal of Comparative Neurology by Nassif et al. and by Hartenstein et al. highlight one of the first demonstrations of a further opportunity in Drosophila. In some cases, it is already possible to suggest how individual cellular elements--neurons, tracts, and neuropil regions--might be traced from the time when they first express a precocious marker, such as the product of the fasciclin-II gene, through the metamorphic pupal stage, and into the adult. In this way, it becomes possible to identify the structures of the adult brain from the time of their first emergence in the embryo and to follow their transitional positions throughout the course of development. Critical in this process is the neuroanatomical organization of the larval brain, which contains not only the fully functional central nervous system of the larva but also the developing elements of the adult brain, because this holds the key to understanding both the cellular elements that are inherited from the embryo and the elements that are in the process of forming the adult nervous system.",1998,"I A Meinertzhagen, J G Emsley, X J Sun, I A Meinertzhagen, J G Emsley, X J Sun"
Molecular characterization of myosin V from Drosophila melanogaster,9536440,10.1023/a:1005356511634,"Recent studies have revealed unconventional myosin V to be an important actin-based molecular motor involved in vesicular movement. In this paper we report the molecular characterization of the Drosophila myosin V, identified by reverse genetics. The gene encodes a 1792-residue, 207 kDa heavy chain polypeptide which possesses a typical head or motor domain of 771 residues, a region of six IQ motifs (139 residues) which serve as potential calmodulin/light chain binding sites at the head/tail junction, and a tail domain of 882 residues containing sequences of putative alpha-helical coiled-coils required for dimerization of the molecule and sequences of non-helical structure at the C-terminal end. Based on Southern blot analyses and chromosomal localization, evidence is presented for a single Drosophila myosin V gene. RNA analyses revealed a doublet of transcripts of about 6 kb, expressed throughout the lifetime of a fly but particularly abundant in the early stages of embryonic development (maternally contributed), in the ectodermic tissue of the hindgut starting at stage 16, and in the adult head. These results suggest that myosin V may be involved in processes required in a variety of cell types in Drosophila. We have also mapped the Drosophila myosin V locus to chromosome 2 at the position 43C-D, and we are currently searching for known mutations in this region. Finally, phylogenetic analysis of the head domain reveals that Drosophila myosin V is more closely related to mammalian myosin Va and Vb than to other invertebrate class-V myosins; nevertheless, it is not significantly more related to myosin Va than to myosin Vb. While vertebrates would need two different myosin V isoforms to accomplish specific functions, we speculate that Drosophila myosin V might provide the equivalent functions by itself.",1998,"N BonafÃ©, J R Sellers, N BonafÃ©, J R Sellers"

The paternal effect gene ms(3)sneaky is required for sperm activation and the initiation of embryogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,9630751,10.1006/dbio.1997.8852,"Although a large number of maternal factors are known to be essential for fertilization or the earliest stages of embryogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, the role of paternally supplied products is not clearly understood. Paternal effect mutations provide a means to identify factors specifically required by the sperm after its entry into the egg. Here we describe the third strict paternal effect gene to be identified in Drosophila ms(3)sneaky(snky), which defines the earliest developmental arrest phenotype so far described. Characterization of two independently isolated snky mutations showed that they affected male fertility, but not viability or female fertility. Cytological analyses showed that spermatogenesis proceeded normally in snky males. However, the snky defect was evident after sperm entry into the egg; snky sperm did not undergo nuclear decondensation, form a functional male pronucleus, or initiate mitotic divisions in the egg. Immunolocalization of tubulin and Drosophila Centrosomin, a known centrosomal component, showed that snky-inseminated eggs failed to reconstitute a microtubule-organizing center. In addition, snky sperm chromatin retained the histochemical properties of mature sperm chromatin for several hours after sperm entry, showed reduced staining with membrane-impermeant nuclear dyes, and failed to replicate. We conclude that the snky+ product is required for the initial response of the sperm to cytoplasmic cues in the egg and for the subsequent initiation of embryogenesis in Drosophila. We suggest that all of the snky defects can be explained by the failure of the sperm plasma membrane to break down after entry into the egg.",1998,"K R Fitch, B T Wakimoto, K R Fitch, B T Wakimoto"
N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea predominantly induces mutations at AT base pairs in pre-meiotic germ cells of Drosophila males,9717174,10.1093/mutage/13.4.375,"Molecular mutation spectra induced by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea have been obtained in several organisms and test systems, frequently showing different results. In Drosophila melanogaster this spectrum has been analyzed in postmeiotic stages, resulting in good agreement between the adduct spectrum and mutational events, the majority being GC-->AT transitions (61%). However, when collecting data about in vivo ENU-induced mutations in mouse germ cell stages mostly damage at A:T sites (89%) was observed. In this work we analyze the molecular spectrum induced with ENU in pre-meiotic repair-active male germ cells of D.melanogaster, using the specific locus test (SLT) with the vermilion locus as target. Results show that the most mutagenic sites in spermatogonial stem cells of Drosophila are A:T pairs (85%), with AT-->TA transversions (50%) and AT-->GC transitions (35%) as the most frequent mutations. Differences from the post-meiotic spectrum may be explained by the active repair of some adducts, such as O6-ethylguanine and N-alkyl-induced abasic sites. In addition, these results show the relevance of the minor lesions O4-ethylthymine and O2-ethylthymine in the production of mutations, as a consequence of their poor repair. Finally, since there is a striking similarity to the ENU-induced mutation spectrum in mouse, these results reveal that Drosophila continues to be an excellent model system.",1998,"L Tosal, M A Comendador, L M Sierra, L Tosal, M A Comendador, L M Sierra"
Neocentromere activity of structurally acentric mini-chromosomes in Drosophila,9425896,10.1038/ng0198-30,"Chromosome fragments that lack centromeric DNA (structurally acentric chromosomes) are usually not inherited in mitosis and meiosis. We previously described the isolation, after irradiation of a Drosophila melanogaster mini-chromosome, of structurally acentric mini-chromosomes that display efficient mitotic and meiotic transmission despite their small size (under 300 kb) and lack of centromeric DNA. Here we report that these acentric mini-chromosomes bind the centromere-specific protein ZW10 and associate with the spindle poles in anaphase. The sequences in these acentric mini-chromosomes were derived from the tip of the X chromosome, which does not display centromere activity or localize ZW10, even when separated from the rest of the X. We conclude that the normally non-centromeric DNAs present in these acentric mini-chromosomes have acquired centromere function, and suggest that this example of 'neocentromere' formation involves appropriation of a self-propagating centromeric chromatin structure. The potential relevance of these observations to the identity, propagation and function of normal centromeres is discussed.",1998,"B C Williams, T D Murphy, M L Goldberg, G H Karpen, B C Williams, T D Murphy, M L Goldberg, G H Karpen"
DISENTANGLING THE EFFECTS OF MATING PROPENSITY AND MATING CHOICE IN DROSOPHILA,28568139,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1998.tb05145.x,"Incipient sexual isolation between genotypes, lines, or populations of the same species is commonly measured in Drosophila by choice tests. Results of these tests are known to be influenced, in an undetermined manner, by the mating propensity of competitors and by discriminatory factors during courtship. We have approached the problem by measuring male and female propensities in separate, independent tests, and by examining whether these estimates could explain the results of the choice tests. First, male and female choice tests were used to measure sexual isolation between populations of Drosophila melanogaster and between populations of D. simulans. Significant deviations from random mating occurred in 31 out of 48 tests, in agreement with the propensity values of the tested genotypes. We conclude that mating propensity instead of discrimination is directly involved in the estimation of sexual isolation in our populations, and advise against the application of male and female choice tests to assess intraspecific isolation without a proper knowledge of the mating propensities of competing individuals. Second, multiple choice tests were used to assess isolation between D. melanogaster populations. In examining the dynamics of matings throughout the test, we show that if competing individuals differ in mating propensities and tests are long enough to allow most matings to happen, a spurious sexual isolation can appear. We recommend that multiple choice tests be terminated once 50 percent of matings had been observed.",1998,"Pelayo Casares, Maria C Carracedo, Beatriz Del Rio, Rafael Pineiro, Lucia Garcia-Florez, Ana R Barros, Pelayo Casares, Maria C Carracedo, Beatriz Del Rio, Rafael Pineiro, Lucia Garcia-Florez, Ana R Barros"
"[A genetic factor, suppressing DNA underreplication in Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes]",9719924,,"The Drosophila melanogaster line carrying the In(I)scv2 was found to exhibit unique cytological phenotype distinguished by the lack of ""weak"" points in the intercalary heterochromatin of the salivary gland polytene chromosomes, the absence of ectopic contacts between the chromosome regions, and the occurrence of additional intercalary heterochromatin in the centromeric regions. Southern blot hybridization revealed the absence of DNA underreplication in the intercalary heterochromatin region 39E carrying the histone gene cluster. This phenotype may have arisen under the influence of a genetic factor, Su(UR), which suppressed DNA underreplication in polytene chromosomes. Genetic analysis of the inheritance of the ""suppression of DNA underreplication"" phenotype showed that this factor was located in the third chromosome and was expressed in a semidominant manner. Discovery of Su(UR) suggested existence of common mechanisms regulating DNA underreplication in the centromeric and intercalary heterochromatin regions containing genes that were completely inactivated during ontogeny.

Metabolic reserves and evolved stress resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,9754535,10.1086/515963,"We have examined starvation and desiccation resistance in 43 outbred populations of Drosophila melanogaster that have diverged from a common ancestral population as a result of a variety of defined selection protocols. The populations differ up to 8.5-fold in desiccation resistance and up to 10-fold in starvation resistance. We used these populations to search for evolved physiological changes that might explain the differences in stress resistance. We examined two hypotheses for increased stress resistance that had been proposed previously in the literature: (1) that increments in starvation resistance are principally the result of differential lipid accumulation, and (2) that changes in glycogen accumulation play a role in evolved increases in resistance to desiccation stress. By quantifying desiccation resistance, starvation resistance, lipid content, and carbohydrate content in each of our populations of flies, we were able to demonstrate strong correlations between the capacity of the flies to resist starvation and the quantity of lipid or carbohydrate that the flies had stored. The strongest correlation (R2 = 0.99) was observed when the total energy content of both the lipid and carbohydrate stores was regressed against starvation resistance. These results demonstrate that the flies responded to selection for starvation resistance through a genetically determined increase in both lipid and carbohydrate storage. Similar analyses of the correlation between lipid storage or total energy storage and desiccation resistance revealed no significant correlations. Carbohydrate storage was significantly correlated with desiccation resistance in female but not in male flies. These results suggest that different forms of stress are resisted with distinct physiological mechanisms and that the evolutionary response of the flies to stress selection is specific to the stress imposed.",1998,"M Djawdan, A K Chippindale, M R Rose, T J Bradley, M Djawdan, A K Chippindale, M R Rose, T J Bradley"

A signaling protease required for melanization in Drosophila affects resistance and tolerance of infections,19071960,10.1371/journal.pbio.0060305,"Organisms evolve two routes to surviving infections-they can resist pathogen growth (resistance) and they can endure the pathogenesis of infection (tolerance). The sum of these two properties together defines the defensive capabilities of the host. Typically, studies of animal defenses focus on either understanding resistance or, to a lesser extent, tolerance mechanisms, thus providing little understanding of the relationship between these two mechanisms. We suggest there are nine possible pairwise permutations of these traits, assuming they can increase, decrease, or remain unchanged in an independent manner. Here we show that by making a single mutation in the gene encoding a protease, CG3066, active in the melanization cascade in Drosophila melanogaster, we observe the full spectrum of changes; these mutant flies show increases and decreases in their resistance and tolerance properties when challenged with a variety of pathogens. This result implicates melanization in fighting microbial infections and shows that an immune response can affect both resistance and tolerance to infections in microbe-dependent ways. The fly is often described as having an unsophisticated and stereotypical immune response where single mutations cause simple binary changes in immunity. We report a level of complexity in the fly's immune response that has strong ecological implications. We suggest that immune responses are highly tuned by evolution, since selection for defenses that alter resistance against one pathogen may change both resistance and tolerance to other pathogens.",2008,"Janelle S Ayres, David S Schneider, Janelle S Ayres, David S Schneider"
"Drosophila melanogaster-based screening for multihost virulence factors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 and identification of a virulence-attenuating factor, HudA",18591226,10.1128/IAI.01637-07,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic human pathogen that interacts with phylogenetically diverse nonmammalian hosts, including plants, nematodes, and insects. Here, we exploited the P. aeruginosa-induced killing of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as an assay system to screen for virulence-attenuated mutants of P. aeruginosa PA14. Fifteen nonredundant mutants were isolated from 4,018 random transposon (TnphoA) insertion clones, and 13 out of them (86.7%) displayed significantly reduced virulence in a murine peritonitis model as well. The TnphoA insertion sites of the 15 mutants were determined; already known virulence genes (dsbA, pvdI, fhlB, pilF, and wspF) and new virulence genes such as PA0253 (hudR), PA0369, PA2077, PA0272, PA2113, PA2965 (fabF1), and PA2002 were identified; one insertion was located at the intergenic region between PA1928 and PA1929; and the other two insertions were located in the genes (PA14_35740 and PA14_36000) within a putative genomic island, indicating a potential pathogenicity island of PA14. Further characterization of hudR, a virulence gene which encodes a MarR/SlyA family transcription factor, revealed that elevated expression of PA0254 (hudA [homologous to UbiD]) was necessary and sufficient for the virulence attenuation of the hudR mutant. The HudR protein repressed the hudAR operon by directly binding to its upstream promoter region. Collectively, these results validate the relevance of the D. melanogaster model for the high-throughput identification of new virulence factors involved in the multihost pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa.",2008,"Seol-Hee Kim, Shin-Young Park, Yun-Jeong Heo, You-Hee Cho, Seol-Hee Kim, Shin-Young Park, Yun-Jeong Heo, You-Hee Cho"

Effects of acclimation temperature on thermal tolerance and membrane phospholipid composition in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,18280492,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2007.12.011,"Adaptative responses of ectothermic organisms to thermal variation typically involve the reorganization of membrane glycerophospholipids (GPLs) to maintain membrane function. We investigated how acclimation at 15, 20 and 25 degrees C during preimaginal development influences the thermal tolerance and the composition of membrane GPLs in adult Drosophila melanogaster. Long-term cold survival was significantly improved by low acclimation temperature. After 60 h at 0 degrees C, more than 80% of the 15 degrees C-acclimated flies survived while none of the 25 degrees C-acclimated flies survived. Cold shock tolerance (1h at subzero temperatures) was also slightly better in the cold acclimated flies. LT50 shifted down by ca 1.5 degrees C in 15 degrees C-acclimated flies in comparison to those acclimated at 25 degrees C. In contrast, heat tolerance was not influenced by acclimation temperature. Low temperature acclimation was associated with the increase in proportion of ethanolamine (from 52.7% to 58.5% in 25 degrees C-acclimated versus 15 degrees C-acclimated flies, respectively) at the expense of choline in GPLs. Relatively small, but statistically significant changes in lipid molecular composition were observed with decreasing acclimation temperature. In particular, the proportions of glycerophosphoethanolamines with linoleic acid (18:2) at the sn-2 position increased. No overall change in the degree of fatty acid unsaturation was observed.

Two distinct mechanisms generate endogenous siRNAs from bidirectional transcription in Drosophila melanogaster,18500351,10.1038/nsmb.1438,"Cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs) have been speculated to be substrates for endogenous RNA interference (RNAi), but little experimental evidence for such a pathway in animals has been reported. Analysis of massive Drosophila melanogaster small RNA data sets now reveals two mechanisms that yield endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) via bidirectional transcription. First, >100 cis-NATs with overlapping 3' exons generate 21-nt, and, based on previously published small RNA data [corrected] Dicer-2 (Dcr-2)-dependent, 3'-end modified siRNAs. The processing of cis-NATs by RNA interference (RNAi) seems to be actively restricted, and the selected loci are enriched for nucleic acid-based functions and include Argonaute-2 (AGO2) itself. Second, we report that extended intervals of the thickveins and klarsicht genes generate exceptionally abundant siRNAs from both strands. These siRNA clusters derive from atypical cis-NAT arrangements involving introns and 5' or internal exons, but their biogenesis is similarly Dcr-2- and AGO2-dependent.

Distinct activation patterns of EGF receptor signaling in the homoplastic evolution of eggshell morphology in genus Drosophila,18762251,10.1016/j.mod.2008.08.001,"Homoplasy is a phenomenon in which organisms in different phylogenetic groups independently acquire similar traits. However, it is largely unknown how developmental mechanisms are altered to give rise to homoplasy. In the genus Drosophila, all species of the subgenus Sophophora, including Drosophila (D.) melanogaster, have eggshells with two dorsal appendages (DAs); most species in the subgenus Drosophila, including D. virilis, and in the subgenus Dorsilopha, have four-DAs. D. melanica belongs to the Drosophila subgenus, but has two-DAs, and phylogenetic analyses suggest that it acquired this characteristic independently. The patterning of the DAs is tightly regulated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in D. melanogaster. Previous studies suggested that a change in the EGFR signal activation pattern could have led to the divergence in DA number between D. melanogaster and D. virilis. Here, we compared the patterns of EGFR signal activation across the Drosophila subgenera by immunostaining for anti-activated MAP kinase (MAPK). Our analysis revealed distinct patterns of EGFR signal activation in each subgenus that was consistent with their phylogenetic relationship. In addition, the number of DAs always corresponded to the number of EGFR signaling activation domains in two, three, and four-DA species. Despite their common two-DA characteristic, the EGFR signaling activation pattern in D. melanica diverged significantly from that of species in the subgenus Sophophora. Our results suggest that acquisition of the homoplastic two-DA characteristic could be explained by modifications of the EGFR signaling system in the genus Drosophila that occurred independently and at least twice during evolution.",2008,"Tatsuo Kagesawa, Yukio Nakamura, Minori Nishikawa, Yota Akiyama, Miyuki Kajiwara, Kenji Matsuno, Tatsuo Kagesawa, Yukio Nakamura, Minori Nishikawa, Yota Akiyama, Miyuki Kajiwara, Kenji Matsuno"

However, little work has been done in D. melanogaster on the effect of temperature on the immune system. Here we describe experiments that demonstrate that cooler temperatures enhance survival after infection and alter expression of immune-related genes in flies. This effect appears to be due not only to the fact that colder temperatures slow down bacterial growth, but also to the beneficial effects of cooler temperature on immune function. We explore the possibility that heat shock proteins, and in particular, Hsp83, may improve immune function at cool temperatures. We have long known that temperature can alter immune responses against microbial pathogens in insects. The approach described here allows us to determine whether this effect is due primarily to temperature-specific effects on the host or on its pathogen.

Central to the regulation of apoptosis is the caspase family of cysteine proteases, and studies in Drosophila have revealed insights into their regulation and function. This chapter describes protocols for detecting apoptotic cells during Drosophila development, as well as the use of Drosophila cell lines. Commonly used methods for detecting apoptosis are described, including TUNEL, acridine orange, and immunostaining with specific components of the apoptotic pathway such as active caspases. A crucial step in the induction of apoptosis is caspase activation and cleavage, which can be measured by use of fluorogenic peptide substrates or detection of cleaved protein products by immunoblotting, respectively.

KrÃ¼ppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1) mediates juvenile hormone action during metamorphosis of Drosophila melanogaster,18036785,10.1016/j.mod.2007.10.002,"Juvenile hormone (JH) given at pupariation inhibits bristle formation and causes pupal cuticle formation in the abdomen of Drosophila melanogaster due to its prolongation of expression of the transcription factor Broad (BR). In a microarray analysis of JH-induced gene expression in abdominal integument, we found that KrÃ¼ppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1) was up-regulated during most of adult development. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that Kr-h1 up-regulation began at 10h after puparium formation (APF), and Kr-h1 up-regulation occurred in imaginal epidermal cells, persisting larval muscles, and larval oenocytes. Ectopic expression of Kr-h1 in abdominal epidermis using T155-Gal4 to drive UAS-Kr-h1 resulted in missing or short bristles in the dorsal midline. This phenotype was similar to that seen after a low dose of JH or after misexpression of br between 21 and 30 h APF. Ectopic expression of Kr-h1 prolonged the expression of BR protein in the pleura and the dorsal tergite. No Kr-h1 was seen after misexpression of br. Thus, Kr-h1 mediates some of the JH signaling in the adult abdominal epidermis and is upstream of br in this pathway. We also show for the first time that the JH-mediated maintenance of br expression in this epidermis is patterned and that JH delays the fusion of the imaginal cells and the disappearance of Dpp in the dorsal midline.",2008,"Chieka Minakuchi, Xiaofeng Zhou, Lynn M Riddiford, Chieka Minakuchi, Xiaofeng Zhou, Lynn M Riddiford"

We address this issue by comparing the performance of replicated noninbred and inbred Drosophila lines under field and laboratory conditions. We asked whether environment-dependent effects of inbreeding can be demonstrated for a field-fitness component in Drosophila, the ability of flies to locate resources, and associated the results with results on effects of inbreeding investigated in the laboratory. Inbreeding effects were evident when releases were undertaken under warm conditions, but not under cold conditions, which illustrates the environment-dependent nature of inbreeding depression. Inbreeding effects were much stronger in the field at warm temperatures than in laboratory stress tests, particularly for females. Effects of inbreeding based on performance in traditional inbreeding assays (viability, productivity) or from laboratory stress tests poorly predicted performance in the field. Inbreeding effects on resource location in the field can be strongly deleterious under some thermal conditions and involve traits not easily measured under laboratory conditions.

Measuring mRNA stability during early Drosophila embryogenesis,19111183,10.1016/S0076-6879(08)02616-5,"Maternal mRNAs play a major role in directing early Drosophila melanogaster development, and thus, precise posttranscriptional regulation of these messages is imperative for normal embryogenesis.

In this chapter, we describe molecular methods to determine the kinetics and mechanisms of maternal mRNA decay in the early D. melanogaster embryo. We show how both unfertilized eggs and fertilized embryos can be used to identify maternal mRNAs destined for degradation, to explain changes in decay kinetics over time, and to uncover the molecular mechanisms of targeted maternal mRNA turnover. In the first section, we explore the methods and outcomes of measuring decay on a ""gene-by-gene"" basis, which involves examination of a small number of transcripts by Northern blotting, RNA dot blotting, and real-time RT-PCR. In the second section, we provide a comprehensive examination of the applications of microarray technology to study global changes in maternal mRNA decay during early development.

Nonrandom Wolbachia infection status of Drosophila melanogaster strains with different mtDNA haplotypes,18780877,10.1093/molbev/msn199,"Wolbachia are maternally inherited bacteria, which typically spread in the host population by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). In Drosophila melanogaster, Wolbachia is quite common but CI is variable, with most of the studies reporting low levels of CI. Surveying mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation and infection status in a worldwide D. melanogaster collection, we found that the Wolbachia infection was not randomly distributed among flies with different mtDNA haplotypes. This preferential infection of some mtDNA haplotypes could be caused by a recent spread of mtDNA haplotypes associated with the infection. The comparison of contemporary D. melanogaster samples with lines collected more than 50 years ago shows that indeed one haplotype with a high incidence of Wolbachia infection has increased in frequency. Consistent with this observation, we found that the acquisition of a Wolbachia infection in a population from Crete was accompanied with an almost complete mtDNA replacement, with the Wolbachia-associated haplotype becoming abundant.

Human DNMT2 methylates tRNA(Asp) molecules using a DNA methyltransferase-like catalytic mechanism,18567810,10.1261/rna.970408,"Although their amino acid sequences and structure closely resemble DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt2 proteins were recently shown by Goll and colleagues to function as RNA methyltransferases transferring a methyl group to the C5 position of C38 in tRNA(Asp).

RNA extracted from wild type D. melanogaster was methylated to a lower degree, but in the case of Dictyostelium, there was no difference in the methylation of RNA isolated from wild-type and Dnmt2 knock-out strains. Methylation of in vitro transcribed tRNA(Asp) confirms it to be a target of DNMT2. Using site directed mutagenesis, we show here that the enzyme has a DNA methyltransferase-like mechanism, because similar residues from motifs IV, VI, and VIII are involved in catalysis as identified in DNA methyltransferases.

Neuroarchitecture of aminergic systems in the larval ventral ganglion of Drosophila melanogaster,18365004,10.1371/journal.pone.0001848,"Biogenic amines are important signaling molecules in the central nervous system of both vertebrates and invertebrates. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, biogenic amines take part in the regulation of various vital physiological processes such as feeding, learning/memory, locomotion, sexual behavior, and sleep/arousal. Consequently, several morphological studies have analyzed the distribution of aminergic neurons in the CNS. Previous descriptions, however, did not determine the exact spatial location of aminergic neurite arborizations within the neuropil. The release sites and pre-/postsynaptic compartments of aminergic neurons also remained largely unidentified. We here used gal4-driven marker gene expression and immunocytochemistry to map presumed serotonergic (5-HT), dopaminergic, and tyraminergic/octopaminergic neurons in the thoracic and abdominal neuromeres of the Drosophila larval ventral ganglion relying on Fasciclin2-immunoreactive tracts as three-dimensional landmarks. With tyrosine hydroxylase- (TH) or tyrosine decarboxylase 2 (TDC2)-specific gal4-drivers, we also analyzed the distribution of ectopically expressed neuronal compartment markers in presumptive dopaminergic TH and tyraminergic/octopaminergic TDC2 neurons, respectively. Our results suggest that thoracic and abdominal 5-HT and TH neurons are exclusively interneurons whereas most TDC2 neurons are efferent. 5-HT and TH neurons are ideally positioned to integrate sensory information and to modulate neuronal transmission within the ventral ganglion, while most TDC2 neurons appear to act peripherally. In contrast to 5-HT neurons, TH and TDC2 neurons each comprise morphologically different neuron subsets with separated in- and output compartments in specific neuropil regions.

Drosophila germ-line modulation of insulin signaling and lifespan,18434551,10.1073/pnas.0709128105,"Ablation of germ-line precursor cells in Caenorhabditis elegans extends lifespan by activating DAF-16, a forkhead transcription factor (FOXO) repressed by insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling (IIS). Signals from the gonad might thus regulate whole-organism aging by modulating IIS. To date, the details of this systemic regulation of aging by the reproductive system are not understood, and it is unknown whether such effects are evolutionarily conserved. Here we report that eliminating germ cells (GCs) in Drosophila melanogaster increases lifespan and modulates insulin signaling. Long-lived germ-line-less flies show increased production of Drosophila insulin-like peptides (dilps) and hypoglycemia but simultaneously exhibit several characteristics of IIS impedance, as indicated by up-regulation of the Drosophila FOXO (dFOXO) target genes 4E-BP and l (2)efl and the insulin/IGF-binding protein IMP-L2.

The expression of heat shock protein HSP60A reveals a dynamic mitochondrial pattern in Drosophila melanogaster embryos,18549261,10.1021/pr800006x,"The evolutionarily conserved hsp60 ( heat-shock protein 60) family of molecular chaperones ensures the correct folding of nuclear-encoded proteins after their translocation across the mitochondrial membrane during development as well as after heat-shock treatment. Although the overexpression of HSP60 proteins and their localization in the cytoplasm have been linked with many humans pathologies, the detailed pattern of their expression in different animal models and their subcellular localization during normal development and in stress conditions are little-known. In this report, we have used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by MALDI-TOF to identify and purify heat shock protein HSP60A of Drosophila melanoagaster. We demonstrate that it is heat-shock inducible and describe two novel antisera, specifically designed to recognize the denatured and native polypeptide, respectively, in Drosophila. Immunoelectron microscopy and immunostaining of Drosophila cells with these antibodies reveals that HSP60A is always localized to the inner membrane of mitochondria. Expression of HSP60A is post-transcriptionally regulated in a highly dynamic pattern during embryogenesis, even under heat-shock conditions. In contrast, in very stressful situations, its expression is upregulated transcriptionally over the entire embryo. These findings suggest novel roles for HSP60 family proteins during normal Drosophila development.",2008,"Luis Alberto Baena-LÃ³pez, Jana Alonso, Javier Rodriguez, Juan F SantarÃ©n, Luis Alberto Baena-LÃ³pez, Jana Alonso, Javier Rodriguez, Juan F SantarÃ©n"
In vivo detection of DNA adducts induced by cisplatin using capillary HPLC-ICP-MS and their correlation with genotoxic damage in Drosophila melanogaster,17932658,10.1007/s00216-007-1634-z,"The antitumoral effect of cisplatin [cis-diamminodichloroplatinum(II)] in mammals is related to its binding to DNA components. However, there is a lack of specific chemical methods to selectively detect those adducts formed in vivo at low concentrations. In this work, a new sensitive and selective method of determining cisplatin-DNA adducts based on the use of element-selective mass spectrometry is proposed, and the method is then applied to detect cisplatin adducts induced in vivo in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster. The bioanalytical strategy proposed here allows the determination of the most important DNA adduct formed between adjacent guanine units of the same DNA strand with cisplatin, and it is based on the coupling of capillary liquid chromatography (cap-LC) to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). This set-up allows the simultaneous monitoring of the Pt (from the drug) and P (from the DNA components) present in these adducts, once they have been cleaved by enzymatic hydrolysis of the DNA samples. Using this instrumental set-up, the adducts of cisplatin formed in vivo when D. melanogaster flies are exposed to different cisplatin concentrations can be detected and their concentration determined. The results obtained show a direct correlation between the concentration of cisplatin adducts, the induced genotoxic damage (measured as DNA strand breaks using the Comet assay) and the cisplatin concentration.

A mucin-type O-glycosyltransferase modulates cell adhesion during Drosophila development,18835818,10.1074/jbc.M804267200,"Cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion are crucial during many stages of eukaryotic development. Here, we provide the first example that mucin-type O-linked glycosylation is involved in a developmentally regulated cell adhesion event in Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations in one member of the evolutionarily conserved family of enzymes that initiates O-linked glycosylation alter epithelial cell adhesion in the Drosophila wing blade. A transposon insertion mutation in pgant3 or RNA interference to pgant3 resulted in blistered wings, a phenotype characteristic of genes involved in integrin-mediated cell interactions. Expression of wild type pgant3 in the mutant background rescued the wing blistering phenotype, whereas expression of another family member (pgant35A) did not, revealing a unique requirement for pgant3. pgant3 mutants displayed reduced O-glycosylation along the basal surface of larval wing imaginal discs, which was restored with wild type pgant3 expression, suggesting that reduced glycosylation of basal proteins is responsible for disruption of adhesion in the adult wing blade. Glycosylation reactions demonstrated that PGANT3 glycosylates certain extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that PGANT3 glycosylates tiggrin, an ECM protein known to bind integrin. We propose that this glycosyltransferase is uniquely responsible for glycosylating tiggrin in the wing disc, thus modulating proper cell adhesion through integrin-ECM interactions. This study provides the first evidence for the role of O-glycosylation in a developmentally regulated, integrin-mediated, cell adhesion event and reveals a novel player in wing blade formation during Drosophila development.",2008,"Liping Zhang, Ying Zhang, Kelly G Ten Hagen, Liping Zhang, Ying Zhang, Kelly G Ten Hagen"
Cdc42 and Par proteins stabilize dynamic adherens junctions in the Drosophila neuroectoderm through regulation of apical endocytosis,19064670,10.1083/jcb.200807020,"Cell rearrangements require dynamic changes in cell-cell contacts to maintain tissue integrity. We investigated the function of Cdc42 in maintaining adherens junctions (AJs) and apical polarity in the Drosophila melanogaster neuroectodermal epithelium. About one third of cells exit the epithelium through ingression and become neuroblasts. Cdc42-compromised embryos lost AJs in the neuroectoderm during neuroblast ingression. In contrast, when neuroblast formation was suppressed, AJs were maintained despite the loss of Cdc42 function. Loss of Cdc42 function caused an increase in the endocytotic uptake of apical proteins, including apical polarity factors such as Crumbs, which are required for AJ stability. In addition, Cdc42 has a second function in regulating endocytotic trafficking, as it is required for the progression of apical cargo from the early to the late endosome. The Par complex acts as an effector for Cdc42 in controlling the endocytosis of apical proteins. This study reveals functional interactions between apical polarity proteins and endocytosis that are critical for stabilizing dynamic basolateral AJs.",2008,"Kathryn P Harris, Ulrich Tepass, Kathryn P Harris, Ulrich Tepass"
Global chromatin domain organization of the Drosophila genome,18369463,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000045,"In eukaryotes, neighboring genes can be packaged together in specific chromatin structures that ensure their coordinated expression. Examples of such multi-gene chromatin domains are well-documented, but a global view of the chromatin organization of eukaryotic genomes is lacking. To systematically identify multi-gene chromatin domains, we constructed a compendium of genome-scale binding maps for a broad panel of chromatin-associated proteins in Drosophila melanogaster. Next, we computationally analyzed this compendium for evidence of multi-gene chromatin domains using a novel statistical segmentation algorithm. We find that at least 50% of all fly genes are organized into chromatin domains, which often consist of dozens of genes. The domains are characterized by various known and novel combinations of chromatin proteins. The genes in many of the domains are coregulated during development and tend to have similar biological functions. Furthermore, during evolution fewer chromosomal rearrangements occur inside chromatin domains than outside domains. Our results indicate that a substantial portion of the Drosophila genome is packaged into functionally coherent, multi-gene chromatin domains. This has broad mechanistic implications for gene regulation and genome evolution.",2008,"Elzo de Wit, Ulrich Braunschweig, Frauke Greil, Harmen J Bussemaker, Bas van Steensel, Elzo de Wit, Ulrich Braunschweig, Frauke Greil, Harmen J Bussemaker, Bas van Steensel"

To fill this gap and to unveil the identity of novel intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), proteomic methods that combine 2D electrophoresis with mass spectrometry have been developed. Here, we applied the method developed in our laboratory [ Csizmok et al., Mol. Cell. Proteomics 2006, 5, 265- 273 ] to the proteome of Drosophila melanogaster. Protein Df31, earlier described as a histone chaperone involved in chromatin decondensation and stabilization, was among the IDPs identified. Despite some hints at the unusual structural behavior of Df31, this protein has not yet been structurally characterized. Here, we provide evidence by a variety of techniques such as CD, NMR, gel-filtration, limited proteolyzsis and bioinformatics that Df31 is intrinsically disordered along its entire length. Further, by chemical cross-linking, we provide evidence that it is a monomeric protein, and suggest that its function(s) may benefit from having an extended and highly flexible structural state. The potential functional advantages and the generality of protein disorder among chromatin organizing proteins are discussed in detail.

Here, we consider 5 population genetic data sets taken from regions flanking high-frequency transposable elements in North American strains of Drosophila melanogaster, each of which appears to be consistent with the expectations of a partial selective sweep. We use coalescent simulations to explore whether incorporation of the species' demographic history, purifying selection against the element, or suppression of recombination caused by the element could generate putatively adaptive haplotype configurations. Whereas most of the data sets would be rejected as nonneutral under the standard neutral null model, only the data set for which there is strong external evidence in support of an adaptive transposition appears to be nonneutral under the more complex null model and in particular when demography is taken into account.

Regulatory changes underlying expression differences within and between Drosophila species,18278046,10.1038/ng.77,"Differences in gene expression are an important source of phenotypic variation, and can be caused by changes in cis and/or trans regulation. cis-regulatory variants alter allele-specific expression, whereas trans-regulatory variants influence expression of both alleles in a diploid cell. Because of this difference, we hypothesize that natural selection may favor one type of change over the other. Here, we investigate contributions of cis- and trans-regulatory changes to variable intra- and interspecific gene expression using four strains of Drosophila melanogaster, three strains of D. simulans and a total of 78 genes. We show that cis-regulatory changes account for a greater proportion of the expression differences observed between rather than within species. These data are inconsistent with a neutral model assuming equal probabilities of fixation for cis- and trans-regulatory polymorphisms, suggesting that natural selection influences the molecular mechanisms underlying divergent gene expression.

Three of the regions include genes that contribute constituents to the pathway-patched, engrailed, and hh. One of the other regions includes the gene microtubule star (mts) that encodes a subunit of protein phosphatase 2A. We show that mts is necessary for full activation of Hh signaling. A second region includes the gene second mitotic wave missing (swm). swm is recessive lethal and is predicted to encode an evolutionarily conserved protein with RNA binding and Zn(+) finger domains.

Characterization of Drosophila melanogaster JmjC+N histone demethylases,18375980,10.1093/nar/gkn098,"In this article, we characterize histone demethylase activity of the entire family of JmjC+N proteins of Drosophila melanogaster. Our results show that Lid (little imaginal discs), which is structurally homologous to JARID1, demethylates H3K4me3. However, contrary to what would be inferred from its demethylase activity, lid contributes to the establishment of transcriptionally competent chromatin states as: (i) is required for histone H3 acetylation; (ii) contributes to expression of the homoeotic gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx); and (iii) antagonizes heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing (PEV). These results, which are consistent with the identification of lid as a trithorax group (trxG) gene, are discussed in the context of current models for the contribution of H3K4me3 to the regulation of gene expression. Here, we also show that the two Drosophila JMJD2 homologues, dJMJD2(1)/CG15835 and dJMJD2(2)/CG33182, are capable of demethylating both H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. dJMJD2(1)/CG15835 regulates heterochromatin organization, as its over-expression induces spreading of HP1, out of heterochromatin, into euchromatin, without affecting the actual pattern of histone modifications of heterochromatin. dJMJD2(1)/CG15835 is excluded from heterochromatin and localizes to multiple euchromatic sites, where it regulates H3K36 methylation. These results indicate that dJMJD2(1)/CG15835 contributes to delimit hetero- and euchromatic territories through the regulation of H3K36 methylation in euchromatin. On the other hand, dJARID2/CG3654 shows no demethylase activity on H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3 and H4K20me3.",2008,"Marta Lloret-Llinares, ClÃ©ment CarrÃ©, Alejandro Vaquero, Natalia de Olano, Fernando AzorÃ­n, Marta Lloret-Llinares, ClÃ©ment CarrÃ©, Alejandro Vaquero, Natalia de Olano, Fernando AzorÃ­n"

We used the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the responses to DR of flies mutant for the transcription factor dFOXO, the main transcription factor target of IIS. We found that lifespan extension by DR does not require dFOXO. However, flies with dFOXO overexpressed in the adult fat body showed an altered response to DR and behaved as though partially dietarily restricted. These results suggest that, although DR extends lifespan of flies in the absence of dFOXO, the presence of active dFOXO modulates the response to DR, possibly by modifying expression of its target genes, and may therefore mediate the normal response to DR.",2008,"Maria E Giannakou, Martin Goss, Linda Partridge, Maria E Giannakou, Martin Goss, Linda Partridge"

      Adaptive protein evolution is common in several Drosophila species investigated. Some studies point to very weak selection operating on amino-acid mutations, with average selection intensities on the order of Nes approximately in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Species with lower effective population sizes should undergo less adaptation since they generate fewer mutations and selection is ineffective on a greater proportion of beneficial mutations.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here I study patterns of polymorphism and divergence at 91 X-linked loci in D. miranda, a species with a roughly 5-fold smaller effective population size than D. melanogaster. Surprisingly, I find a similar fraction of amino-acid mutations being driven to fixation by positive selection in D. miranda and D. melanogaster. Genes with higher rates of amino-acid evolution show lower levels of neutral diversity, a pattern predicted by recurrent adaptive protein evolution. I fit a hitchhiking model to patterns of polymorphism in D. miranda and D. melanogaster and estimate an order of magnitude higher selection coefficients for beneficial mutations in D. miranda.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      This analysis suggests that effective population size may not be a major determinant in rates of protein adaptation. Instead, adaptation may not be mutation-limited, or the distribution of fitness effects for beneficial mutations might differ vastly between different species or populations.

Unanchored ubiquitin chains do not lead to marked alterations in gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster,31097444,10.1242/bio.043372,"The small protein modifier ubiquitin regulates various aspects of cellular biology through its chemical conjugation onto proteins. Ubiquitination of proteins presents itself in numerous iterations, from a single mono-ubiquitination event to chains of poly-ubiquitin. Ubiquitin chains can be attached onto other proteins or can exist as unanchored species, i.e. free from another protein. Unanchored ubiquitin chains are thought to be deleterious to the cell and rapidly disassembled into mono-ubiquitin. We recently examined the toxicity and utilization of unanchored poly-ubiquitin in Drosophila melanogaster We found that free poly-ubiquitin species are largely innocuous to flies and that free poly-ubiquitin can be controlled by being degraded by the proteasome or by being conjugated onto another protein as a single unit. Here, to explore whether an organismal defense is mounted against unanchored chains, we conducted RNA-Seq analyses to examine the transcriptomic impact of free poly-ubiquitin in the fly. We found ??0 transcripts whose expression is altered in the presence of different types of unanchored poly-ubiquitin. The set of genes identified was essentially devoid of ubiquitin-, proteasome-, or autophagy-related components.

The Neuronal Overexpression of Gclc in Drosophila melanogaster Induces Life Extension With Longevity-Associated Transcriptomic Changes in the Thorax,30891062,10.3389/fgene.2019.00149,"Some effects of aging in animals are tissue-specific. In D. melanogaster neuronal overexpression of Gclc increases lifespan and improves certain physiological parameters associated with health benefits such as locomotor activity, circadian rhythmicity, and stress resistance.

Considering that various tissues age differently and age-related gene expression changes are tissue-specific, we investigated the effects of neuronal Gclc overexpression on gene expression levels in the imago thorax, which is primarily composed of muscles. A total of 58 genes were found to be differentially expressed between thoraces of control and Gclc overexpressing flies. The Gclc level demonstrated associations with expression of genes involved in the circadian rhythmicity, the genes in categories related to the muscle system process and the downregulation of genes involved in proteolysis. Most of the functional categories altered by Gclc overexpression related to metabolism including Drug metabolism, Metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, Glutathione metabolism, Starch and sucrose metabolism, Citrate cycle (TCA cycle), One carbon pool by folate. Thus, the transcriptomic changes caused by neuron-specific Gclc overexpression in the thorax were less pronounced than in the head and affected pathways also differed from previous results.

This test simultaneously evaluated two events related to carcinogenic potential: mutation and somatic recombination. The results indicated that ABC was responsible for toxicity when administered alone or in combination with AZT and/or 3TC. In addition, all treatment combinations increased frequencies of mutation and somatic recombination. The combination of AZT/3TC showed the lowest genotoxic activity compared to all combinations with ABC.

Population Genetic and Functional Analysis of a cis-Regulatory Polymorphism in the Drosophila melanogaster Metallothionein A gene,30769915,10.3390/genes10020147,"Although gene expression can vary extensively within and among populations, the genetic basis of this variation and the evolutionary forces that maintain it are largely unknown. In Drosophila melanogaster, a 49-bp insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphism in the Metallothionein A (MtnA) gene is associated with variation in MtnA expression and oxidative stress tolerance. To better understand the functional and evolutionary significance of this polymorphism, we investigated it in several worldwide populations. In a German population, the deletion was present at a high and stable frequency over multiple seasons and years, and was associated with increased MtnA expression. There was, however, no evidence that the polymorphism was maintained by overdominant, seasonally fluctuating, or sexually antagonistic selection. The deletion was rare in a population from the species' ancestral range in sub-Saharan Africa and is likely the result of non-African admixture, suggesting that it spread to high frequency following the species' out-of-Africa expansion. Using data from a North American population, we found that the deletion was associated with MtnA expression and tolerance to oxidative stress induced by menadione sodium bisulfite. Our results are consistent with the deletion being selectively favored in temperate populations due to the increased MtnA expression and oxidative stress tolerance that it confers.",2019,"Timothy J S Ramnarine, Amanda Glaser-Schmitt, Ana CatalÃ¡n, John Parsch, Timothy J S Ramnarine, Amanda Glaser-Schmitt, Ana CatalÃ¡n, John Parsch"
An evaluation of Drosophila as a model system for studying tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease,30633936,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2019.01.001,"Work spanning almost two decades using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to study tau-mediated neurodegeneration has provided valuable and novel insights into the causes and mechanisms of tau-mediated toxicity and dysfunction in tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The fly has proven to be an excellent model for human diseases because of its cost efficiency, and the availability of powerful genetic tools for use in a comparatively less-complicated, but evolutionarily conserved, in vivo system. In this review, we provide a critical evaluation of the insights provided by fly models, highlighting both the advantages and limitations of the system. The fly has contributed to a greater understanding of the causes of tau abnormalities, the role of these abnormalities in mediating toxicity and/or dysfunction, and the nature of causative species mediating tau-toxicity. However, it is not possible to perfectly model all aspects of human degenerative diseases. What sets the fly apart from other animal models is its genetic tractability, which makes it highly amenable to overcoming experimental limitations. The explosion of genetic technology since the first fly disease models were established has translated into fly lines that allow for greater temporal control in restricting tau expression to single neuron types, and lines that can label and monitor the function of subcellular structures and components; thus, fly models offer an unprecedented view of the neurodegenerative process. Emerging genetic technology means that the fly provides an ever-evolving experimental platform for studying disease.",2019,"Lovesha Sivanantharajah, Amritpal Mudher, David Shepherd, Lovesha Sivanantharajah, Amritpal Mudher, David Shepherd"
CTCF variants in 39 individuals with a variable neurodevelopmental disorder broaden the mutational and clinical spectrum,31239556,10.1038/s41436-019-0585-z,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Pathogenic variants in the chromatin organizer CTCF were previously reported in seven individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD).
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Through international collaboration we collected data from 39 subjects with variants in CTCF. We performed transcriptome analysis on RNA from blood samples and utilized Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the impact of Ctcf dosage alteration on nervous system development and function.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The individuals in our cohort carried 2 deletions, 8 likely gene-disruptive, 2 splice-site, and 20 different missense variants, most of them de novo. Two cases were familial. The associated phenotype was of variable severity extending from mild developmental delay or normal IQ to severe intellectual disability. Feeding difficulties and behavioral abnormalities were common, and variable other findings including growth restriction and cardiac defects were observed. RNA-sequencing in five individuals identified 3828 deregulated genes enriched for known NDD genes and biological processes such as transcriptional regulation. Ctcf dosage alteration in Drosophila resulted in impaired gross neurological functioning and learning and memory deficits.

Visualizing and Tracking Endogenous mRNAs in Live Drosophila melanogaster Egg Chambers,31233020,10.3791/58545,"Fluorescence-based imaging techniques, in combination with developments in light microscopy, have revolutionized how cell biologists conduct live cell imaging studies. Methods for detecting RNAs have expanded greatly since seminal studies linked site-specific mRNA localization to gene expression regulation. Dynamic mRNA processes can now be visualized via approaches that detect mRNAs, coupled with microscopy set-ups that are fast enough to capture the dynamic range of molecular behavior. The molecular beacon technology is a hybridization-based approach capable of direct detection of endogenous transcripts in living cells. Molecular beacons are hairpin-shaped, internally quenched, single-nucleotide discriminating nucleic acid probes, which fluoresce only upon hybridization to a unique target sequence. When coupled with advanced fluorescence microscopy and high-resolution imaging, they enable one to perform spatial and temporal tracking of intracellular movement of mRNAs. Although this technology is the only method capable of detecting endogenous transcripts, cell biologists have not yet fully embraced this technology due to difficulties in designing such probes for live cell imaging. A new software application, PinMol, allows for enhanced and rapid design of probes best suited to efficiently hybridize to mRNA target regions within a living cell. In addition, high-resolution, real-time image acquisition and current, open source image analysis software allow for a refined data output, leading to a finer evaluation of the complexity underlying the dynamic processes involved in the mRNA's life cycle. Here we present a comprehensive protocol for designing and delivering molecular beacons into Drosophila melanogaster egg chambers. Direct and highly specific detection and visualization of endogenous maternal mRNAs is performed via spinning disc confocal microscopy. Imaging data is processed and analyzed using object detection and tracking in Icy software to obtain details about the dynamic movement of mRNAs, which are transported and localized to specialized regions within the oocyte.",2019,"Irina E Catrina, Livia V Bayer, Omar S Omar, Diana P Bratu, Irina E Catrina, Livia V Bayer, Omar S Omar, Diana P Bratu"
Cytochrome P450s Cyp4p1 and Cyp4p2 associated with the DDT tolerance in the Drosophila melanogaster strain 91-R,31400775,10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.06.008,"Cytochrome P450s are part of a super-gene family that has undergone gene duplication, divergence, over-expression and, in some cases, loss of function. One such case is the 91-R and 91-C strains of common origin, in Drosophila melanogaster, whereby 91-R (DDT resistant strain) overexpresses Cyp4p1 and Cyp4p2 and both genes are lost in 91-C (DDT susceptible strain). In this study, we used a comparative approach to demonstrate that transcription of Cyp4p1 and Cyp4p2 were constitutively up-regulated in the Drosophila melanogaster strain 91-R as compared to another DDT susceptible strain Canton-S which does not have a loss of function of these genes. Furthermore, significantly increased expression of Cyp4p1 and Cyp4p2 was induced in 91-R in response to sublethal DDT exposure, however, such induction did not occur in the DDT treated Canton-S. Additionally, fixed nucleotide variation within putative transcription factor binding sites of Cyp4p1 and Cyp4p2 promoters were observed between 91-R and Canton-S, however, their impact on transcription remains to be determined. Two GAL4/UAS transgenic strains with integrated heat shock-inducible Cyp4p1- or Cyp4p2-RNAi constructs within wild-type genetic backgrounds were developed. Following heat shock induction of Cyp4p1 and Cyp4p2 knockdown, these transgenic lines showed increased DDT mortality as compared to their corresponding non-heat shock controls. These results provide a functional link of Cyp4p1 and Cyp4p2 in conferring tolerance to DDT exposure.",2019,"Keon Mook Seong, Brad S Coates, Barry R Pittendrigh, Keon Mook Seong, Brad S Coates, Barry R Pittendrigh"
Rapid Evolution of Gained Essential Developmental Functions of a Young Gene via Interactions with Other Essential Genes,31187122,10.1093/molbev/msz137,"New genes are of recent origin and only present in a subset of species in a phylogeny. Accumulated evidence suggests that new genes, like old genes that are conserved across species, can also take on important functions and be essential for the survival and reproductive success of organisms. Although there are detailed analyses of the mechanisms underlying new genes' gaining fertility functions, how new genes rapidly become essential for viability remains unclear. We focused on a young retro-duplicated gene (CG7804, which we named Cocoon) in Drosophila that originated between 4 and 10 Ma. We found that, unlike its evolutionarily conserved parental gene, Cocoon has evolved under positive selection and accumulated many amino acid differences at functional sites from the parental gene. Despite its young age, Cocoon is essential for the survival of Drosophila melanogaster at multiple developmental stages, including the critical embryonic stage, and its expression is essential in different tissues from those of its parental gene. Functional genomic analyses found that Cocoon acquired unique DNA-binding sites and has a contrasting effect on gene expression to that of its parental gene. Importantly, Cocoon binding predominantly locates at genes that have other essential functions and/or have multiple gene-gene interactions, suggesting that Cocoon acquired novel essential function to survival through forming interactions that have large impacts on the gene interaction network. Our study is an important step toward deciphering the evolutionary trajectory by which new genes functionally diverge from parental genes and become essential.",2019,"Yuh Chwen G Lee, Iuri M Ventura, Gavin R Rice, Dong-Yuan Chen, Serafin U Colmenares, Manyuan Long, Yuh Chwen G Lee, Iuri M Ventura, Gavin R Rice, Dong-Yuan Chen, Serafin U Colmenares, Manyuan Long"

In the present study, we exposed Drosophila melanogaster Canton-S adult females to concentrations of 0 mM, 0.1 mM, 0.3 mM, 3 mM, and 30 mM of mercury chloride (HgCl2) for 24 h, 48 h, or 72 h to determine how mercury could affect fertility. Alkaline assays performed on dissected ovaries showed that mercury induced DNA damage that is not only dose-dependent but also time-dependent. All ovaries treated for 72 h have incorporated mercury and exhibit size reduction. Females treated with 30 mM HgCl2, the highest dose, had atrophied ovaries and exhibited a drastic 7-fold reduction in egg laying. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that exposure to HgCl2 disrupts germinal and somatic cell organization in the germarium and leads to the aberrant expression of a germline-specific gene in somatic follicle cells in developing egg chambers.

The Notch repressor complex in Drosophila: in vivo analysis of Hairless mutants using overexpression experiments,30612166,10.1007/s00427-018-00624-2,"During development of higher animals, the Notch signalling pathway governs cell type specification by mediating appropriate gene expression responses. In the absence of signalling, Notch target genes are silenced by repressor complexes. In the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, the repressor complex includes the transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] and Hairless (H) plus general co-repressors. Recent crystal structure analysis of the Drosophila Notch repressor revealed details of the Su(H)-H complex. They were confirmed by mutational analyses of either protein; however, only Su(H) mutants have been further studied in vivo. Here, we analyse three H variants predicted to affect Su(H) binding. To this end, amino acid replacements Phenylalanine 237, Leucines 245 and 247, as well as Tryptophan 258 to Alanine were introduced into the H protein. A cell-based reporter assay indicates substantial loss of Su(H) binding to the respective mutant proteins HFA, HLLAA and HWA. For in vivo analysis, UAS-lines HFA, HLLAA and HWA were generated to allow spatially restricted overexpression. In these assays, all three mutants resembled the HLD control, shown before to lack Su(H) binding, indicating a strong reduction of H activity. For example, the H variants were impaired in wing margin formation, but unexpectedly induced ectopic wing venation. Concurrent overexpression with Su(H), however, suggests that all mutant H protein isoforms are still able to bind Su(H) in vivo. We conclude that a weakening of the cohesion in the H-Su(H) repressor complex is sufficient for disrupting its in vivo functionality.",2019,"Thomas K Smylla, Markus Meier, Anette Preiss, Dieter Maier, Thomas K Smylla, Markus Meier, Anette Preiss, Dieter Maier"
Evolution of salivary glue genes in Drosophila species,30696414,10.1186/s12862-019-1364-9,"Background:
      
    

    
      At the very end of the larval stage Drosophila expectorate a glue secreted by their salivary glands to attach themselves to a substrate while pupariating. The glue is a mixture of apparently unrelated proteins, some of which are highly glycosylated and possess internal repeats. Because species adhere to distinct substrates (i.e. leaves, wood, rotten fruits), glue genes are expected to evolve rapidly.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We used available genome sequences and PCR-sequencing of regions of interest to investigate the glue genes in 20 Drosophila species. We discovered a new gene in addition to the seven glue genes annotated in D. melanogaster. We also identified a phase 1 intron at a conserved position present in five of the eight glue genes of D. melanogaster, suggesting a common origin for those glue genes. A slightly significant rate of gene turnover was inferred. Both the number of repeats and the repeat sequence were found to diverge rapidly, even between closely related species. We also detected high repeat number variation at the intrapopulation level in D. melanogaster.

Patients deficient in COA8 show specific COX deficiency with distinctive neuroimaging features, i.e., cavitating leukodystrophy.

Analyzing the stability of gene expression using a simple reaction-diffusion model in an early Drosophila embryo,31454629,10.1016/j.mbs.2019.108239,"In all complex organisms, the precise levels and timing of gene expression controls vital biological processes. In higher eukaryotes, including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the complex molecular control of transcription (the synthesis of RNA from DNA) and translation (the synthesis of proteins from RNA) events driving this gene expression are not fully understood. In particular, for Drosophila melanogaster, there is a plethora of experimental data, including quantitative measurements of both RNA and protein concentrations, but the precise mechanisms that control the dynamics of gene expression during early development and the processes which lead to steady-state levels of certain proteins remain elusive. This study analyzes a current mathematical modeling approach in an attempt to better understand the long-term behavior of gene regulation. The model is a modified reaction-diffusion equation which has been previously employed in predicting gene expression levels and studying the relative contributions of transcription and translation events to protein abundance [10,11,24]. Here, we use Matrix Algebra and Analysis techniques to study the stability of the gene expression system and analyze equilibria, using very general assumptions regarding the parameter values incorporated into the model.

"Developmental expression of human tau in Drosophila melanogaster glial cells induces motor deficits and disrupts maintenance of PNS axonal integrity, without affecting synapse formation",31821364,10.1371/journal.pone.0226380,"Tauopathies are a class of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the abnormal phosphorylation and accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein, tau, in both neuronal and glial cells. Though tau pathology in glial cells is a prominent feature of many of these disorders, the pathological contribution of these lesions to tauopathy pathogenesis remains largely unknown. Moreover, while tau pathology is predominantly found in the central nervous system, a role for tau in the cells of the peripheral nervous system has been described, though not well characterized. To investigate the effects of glial tau expression on the development and maintenance of the peripheral nervous system, we utilized a Drosophila melanogaster model of tauopathy that expresses human wild-type tau in glial cells during development. We found that glial tau expression during development results in larval locomotor deficits and organismal lethality at the pupal stage, without affecting larval neuromuscular junction synapse development or post-synaptic amplitude. There was, however, a significant decrease in the decay time of synaptic potentials upon repeated stimulation of the motoneuron. Behavioral abnormalities were accompanied by glial cell death, disrupted maintenance of glial-axonal integrity, and the abnormal accumulation of the presynaptic protein, Bruchpilot, in peripheral nerve axons. Together, these data demonstrate that human tau expression in Drosophila glial cells does not affect neuromuscular junction synapse formation during development, but is deleterious to the maintenance of glial-axonal interactions in the peripheral nervous system.",2019,"Enrico M Scarpelli, Van Y Trinh, Zarrin Tashnim, Jacob L Krans, Lani C Keller, Kenneth J Colodner, Enrico M Scarpelli, Van Y Trinh, Zarrin Tashnim, Jacob L Krans, Lani C Keller, Kenneth J Colodner"

Approximate kernel reconstruction for time-varying networks,30774716,10.1186/s13040-019-0192-1,"Background:
      
    

    
      Most existing algorithms for modeling and analyzing molecular networks assume a static or time-invariant network topology. Such view, however, does not render the temporal evolution of the underlying biological process as molecular networks are typically ""re-wired"" over time in response to cellular development and environmental changes. In our previous work, we formulated the inference of time-varying or dynamic networks as a tracking problem, where the target state is the ensemble of edges in the network. We used the Kalman filter to track the network topology over time. Unfortunately, the output of the Kalman filter does not reflect known properties of molecular networks, such as sparsity.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      To address the problem of inferring sparse time-varying networks from a set of under-sampled measurements, we propose the Approximate Kernel RecONstruction (AKRON) Kalman filter. AKRON supersedes the Lasso regularization by starting from the Lasso-Kalman inferred network and judiciously searching the space for a sparser solution. We derive theoretical bounds for the optimality of AKRON. We evaluate our approach against the Lasso-Kalman filter on synthetic data. The results show that not only does AKRON-Kalman provide better reconstruction errors, but it is also better at identifying if edges exist within a network. Furthermore, we perform a real-world benchmark on the lifecycle (embryonic, larval, pupal, and adult stages) of the Drosophila Melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:

Effect of melatonin on AÎ²42 induced changes in the mitochondrial function related to Alzheimer's disease in Drosophila melanogaster,31325578,10.1016/j.neulet.2019.134376,"Alzheimers's disease is one of the alarming neurodegenerative disease and it is of global concern.The hallmarks of the disease are the amyloid beta (AÎ²) aggregation and presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The interaction of AÎ² with macromolecular targets affects the normal cellular functions. The amyloid peptide interaction with cellular surfaces may trigger the intracellular cascades of signalling. Interaction of AÎ² with mitochondria leads to the generation of free radicals. Many studies have suggested the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. Melatonin prevents mitochondria stress and by means of activating the antioxidant systems it protects the death of neurons. Although the study have been already conducted on AÎ²42 infused or injury induced animal models but till date there is no reports of such studies on transgenic model of Drosophila melanogaster. In the present study, we have taken UAS/Gal4 system for the development of transgenic flies that overexpress AÎ²42 in the brain of Drosophila.

Relationship between viability and genotoxic effect of gamma rays delivered at different dose rates in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,31354077,10.1080/15287394.2019.1646681,"The role of dose rate (DR) on biological effects of ionizing radiation is an area of significant research focus and relevant to environmental exposures. The present investigation was aimed to examine the direct relationship between viability and genotoxicity in Drosophila melanogaster, induced by gamma rays in a range of doses from 2 to 35 Gy administered at three different DR. Results indicated that larval-adult viability was reduced in relation to dose but not DR. No marked differences were found in the LD50 produced by differing DR tested. Frequencies of somatic mutation and recombination increased in direct correlation with dose and DR.

Drosophila melanogaster in nutrition research-the importance of standardizing experimental diets,30766617,10.1186/s12263-019-0627-9,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been increasingly recognized as an important model organism in nutrition research. In order to conduct nutritional studies in fruit flies, special attention should be given to the composition of the experimental diets. Besides complex diets, which are often based on maize, yeast, sucrose, and agar, Drosophila can be also fed chemically defined diets. These so-called holidic diets are standardized in terms of their macro- and micronutrient composition although the quantitative nutrient requirements of flies have yet not been fully established and warrant further investigations. For instance, only few studies address the fatty acid, vitamin, mineral, and trace element requirements of fruit flies. D. melanogaster may be also of interest in the field of nutritional medicine. Diet-induced diabetes and obesity models have been established, and in this context, often, the so-called high-fat and high-sugar diets are fed. However, the composition of these diets is not sufficiently defined and varies between studies. A consensus within the scientific community needs to be reached to standardize the exact composition of experimental complex and holidic diets for D. melanogaster in nutrition research. Since D. melanogaster is an established valuable model system for numerous human diseases, standardized diets are also a prerequisite to conduct diet-disease interaction studies. We suggest that a comprehensive approach, which combines deep phenotyping with disease-related Drosophila models under defined dietary conditions, might lead to the foundation of a so-called fly clinic.",2019,"Kai LÃ¼ersen, Thomas RÃ¶der, Gerald Rimbach"
Does adaptation to different diets result in assortative mating? Ambiguous results from experiments on Drosophila,30222229,10.1111/jeb.13375,"The emergence of behavioural isolation between populations under divergent selection can be crucial for ecological speciation, but the mechanisms underlying such isolation are poorly understood. Several experimental evolution studies have shown that positive assortative mating (preference for similar mates) can arise rapidly in Drosophila laboratory populations reared in different stressful conditions, while other studies failed to confirm this effect. Here, we present the results of an evolution experiment in which outbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster were reared for 1-2 years on one of the three different diets (standard, starch based or high salt). We show that nonrandom mating arose in some, but not all lines, and that the manifestations and possible interpretations of this nonrandomness depend strongly on the type of tests used to assess mating preferences. More specifically, multiple-choice four-fly tests revealed positive assortative mating (prevalence of homogamic matings) in some starch-adapted and salt-adapted lines when paired with a control line reared on the standard diet, but competitive three-fly tests rather revealed competitive advantage of control males and females over the flies reared on stressful diets. The results imply that divergent adaptation can result in differences in mating propensity or competitive ability, which, in turn, may either facilitate or hamper speciation depending on the relative frequency of high- vs. low-competition settings in natural habitats of the diverging populations. The results also emphasize the importance of using diverse tests for assessing mating structure in natural and laboratory populations.",2018,"Elena G Belkina, Elena B Naimark, Anastasiya A Gorshkova, Alexander V Markov, Elena G Belkina, Elena B Naimark, Anastasiya A Gorshkova, Alexander V Markov"
Regulation of the X Chromosome in the Germline and Soma of Drosophila melanogaster Males,29734690,10.3390/genes9050242,"During the evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes, the sex-specific Y chromosome degenerates, while the X chromosome evolves new mechanisms of regulation. Using bioinformatic and experimental approaches, we investigate the expression of the X chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster. We observe nearly complete X chromosome dosage compensation in male somatic tissues, but not in testis. The X chromosome contains disproportionately fewer genes with high expression in testis than the autosomes, even after accounting for the lack of dosage compensation, which suggests that another mechanism suppresses their expression in the male germline. This is consistent with studies of reporter genes and transposed genes, which find that the same gene has higher expression when autosomal than when X-linked. Using a new reporter gene that is expressed in both testis and somatic tissues, we find that the suppression of X-linked gene expression is limited to genes with high expression in testis and that the extent of the suppression is positively correlated with expression level.",2018,"Eliza Argyridou, John Parsch, Eliza Argyridou, John Parsch"
Building a platform for predicting functions of serine protease-related proteins in Drosophila melanogaster and other insects,30367934,10.1016/j.ibmb.2018.10.006,"Serine proteases (SPs) and serine protease homologs (SPHs) play essential roles in insect physiological processes including digestion, defense and development. Studies of insect genomes, transcriptomes and proteomes have generated a vast amount of information on these proteins, dwarfing the biological data acquired from a few model species. The large number and high diversity of homologous sequences makes it a challenge to use the limited functional information for making predictions across a broad taxonomic group of insects. In this work, we have extensively updated the framework of knowledge on the SP-related proteins in Drosophila melanogaster by identifying 52 new SPs/SPHs, classifying the 257 proteins into four groups (CLIP, gut, single- and multi-domain SPs/SPHs), and detecting inherent connections among phylogenetic relationships, genomic locations and expression profiles for 99 of the genes. Information on the existence of specific proteins in eggs, larvae, pupae and adults is presented to facilitate future research. More importantly, we have developed an approach to reveal close homologous or orthologous relationships among SPs/SPHs from D. melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, Manduca sexta, and Tribolium castaneum thus inspiring functional studies in these and other holometabolous insects.

NAP Family CG5017 Chaperone Pleiotropically Regulates Human AHR Target Genes Expression in Drosophila Testis,30597983,10.3390/ijms20010118,"To study the regulatory mechanism of the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), target genes of transcription are necessary for understanding the normal developmental and pathological processes. Here, we examined the effects of human AHR ligands on male fecundity. To induce ectopic human AhR gene expression, we used Drosophila melanogaster transformed with human AhR under the control of a yeast UAS promoter element capable of activation in the two-component UAS-GAL4 system. We found that exogenous AHR ligands decrease the number of Drosophila gonadal Tj-positive cells. We also found both an increase and decrease of AHR target gene expression, including in genes that control homeostasis and testis development. This suggests that gonadal AHR activation may affect the expression of gene networks that control sperm production and could be critical for fertility not just in Drosophila but also in humans. Finally, we found that the activation of the expression for some AHR target genes depends on the expression of testis-specific chaperone CG5017 in gonadal cells. Since CG5017 belongs to the nucleosome assembly protein (NAP) family and may participate in epigenetic regulation, we propose that this nucleotropic chaperone is essential to provide the human AHR with access to only the defined set of its target genes during spermatogenesis.",2018,"Angelina A Akishina, Julia E Vorontsova, Roman O Cherezov, Mikhail S Slezinger, Olga B Simonova, Boris A Kuzin, Angelina A Akishina, Julia E Vorontsova, Roman O Cherezov, Mikhail S Slezinger, Olga B Simonova, Boris A Kuzin"

Genome-wide maps of ribosomal occupancy provide insights into adaptive evolution and regulatory roles of uORFs during Drosophila development,30028832,10.1371/journal.pbio.2003903,"Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) play important roles in regulating the main coding DNA sequences (CDSs) via translational repression. Despite their prevalence in the genomes, uORFs are overall discriminated against by natural selection. However, it remains unclear why in the genomes there are so many uORFs more conserved than expected under the assumption of neutral evolution. Here, we generated genome-wide maps of translational efficiency (TE) at the codon level throughout the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster. We identified 35,735 uORFs that were expressed, and 32,224 (90.2%) of them showed evidence of ribosome occupancy during Drosophila development. The ribosome occupancy of uORFs is determined by genomic features, such as optimized sequence contexts around their start codons, a shorter distance to CDSs, and higher coding potentials. Our population genomic analysis suggests the segregating mutations that create or disrupt uORFs are overall deleterious in D. melanogaster. However, we found for the first time that many (68.3% of) newly fixed uORFs that are associated with ribosomes in D. melanogaster are driven by positive Darwinian selection. Our findings also suggest that uORFs play a vital role in controlling the translational program in Drosophila. Moreover, we found that many uORFs are transcribed or translated in a developmental stage-, sex-, or tissue-specific manner, suggesting that selective transcription or translation of uORFs could potentially modulate the TE of the downstream CDSs during Drosophila development.",2018,"Hong Zhang, Shengqian Dou, Feng He, Junjie Luo, Liping Wei, Jian Lu, Hong Zhang, Shengqian Dou, Feng He, Junjie Luo, Liping Wei, Jian Lu"

Interactions between the sexual identity of the nervous system and the social environment mediate lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster,30487307,10.1098/rspb.2018.1450,"Sex differences in lifespan are ubiquitous, but the underlying causal factors remain poorly understood. Inter- and intrasexual social interactions are well known to influence lifespan in many taxa, but it has proved challenging to separate the role of sex-specific behaviours from wider physiological differences between the sexes. To address this problem, we genetically manipulated the sexual identity of the nervous system-and hence sexual behaviour-in Drosophila melanogaster, and measured lifespan under varying social conditions. Consistent with previous studies, masculinization of the nervous system in females induced male-specific courtship behaviour and aggression, while nervous system feminization in males induced male-male courtship and reduced aggression. Control females outlived males, but masculinized female groups displayed male-like lifespans and male-like costs of group living. By varying the mixture of control and masculinized females within social groups, we show that male-specific behaviours are costly to recipients, even when received from females. However, consistent with recent findings, our data suggest courtship expression to be surprisingly low cost. Overall, our study indicates that nervous system-mediated expression of sex-specific behaviour per se-independent of wider physiological differences between the sexes, or the receipt of aggression or courtship-plays a limited role in mediating sex differences in lifespan.",2018,"Ewan O Flintham, Tomoyo Yoshida, Sophie Smith, Hania J Pavlou, Stephen F Goodwin, Pau Carazo, Stuart Wigby, Ewan O Flintham, Tomoyo Yoshida, Sophie Smith, Hania J Pavlou, Stephen F Goodwin, Pau Carazo, Stuart Wigby"

While the mechanism of degeneration is elusive, abnormalities in mitochondrial function and turnover are strongly implicated. An Autosomal Recessive-Juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP) Drosophila melanogaster model exhibits DA neurodegeneration as well as aberrant mitochondrial dynamics and function. Disruptions in mitophagy have been observed in parkin loss-of-function models, and changes in mitochondrial respiration have been reported in patient fibroblasts. Whether loss of parkin causes selective DA neurodegeneration in vivo as a result of lost or decreased mitophagy is unknown. This study employs the use of fluorescent constructs expressed in Drosophila DA neurons that are functionally homologous to those of the mammalian substantia nigra. We provide evidence that degenerating DA neurons in parkin loss-of-function mutant flies have advanced mitochondrial aging, and that mitochondrial networks are fragmented and contain swollen organelles. We also found that mitophagy initiation is decreased in park (Drosophila parkin/PARK2 ortholog) homozygous mutants, but autophagosome formation is unaffected, and mitochondrial network volumes are decreased. As the fly ages, autophagosome recruitment becomes similar to control, while mitochondria continue to show signs of damage, and climbing deficits persist. Interestingly, aberrant mitochondrial morphology, aging and mitophagy initiation were not observed in DA neurons that do not degenerate. Our results suggest that parkin is important for mitochondrial homeostasis in vulnerable Drosophila DA neurons, and that loss of parkin-mediated mitophagy may play a role in degeneration of relevant DA neurons or motor deficits in this model.",2018,"Juliana Cackovic, Susana Gutierrez-Luke, Gerald B Call, Amber Juba, Stephanie O'Brien, Charles H Jun, Lori M Buhlman, Juliana Cackovic, Susana Gutierrez-Luke, Gerald B Call, Amber Juba, Stephanie O'Brien, Charles H Jun, Lori M Buhlman"

Previously, we reported that the ADAMTS-like protein Lonely heart (Loh) is critical for recruiting the type IV collagen-like protein Pericardin to the cardiac ECM. Here, we utilized Drosophila as a simple and genetically amenable invertebrate model for studying Loh-mediated recruitment of tissue-specific ECM components such as Pericardin to the ECM. We focused on the functional relevance of distinct Loh domains to protein localization and Pericardin recruitment. Analysis of Loh deletion constructs revealed that one thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR1-1), which has an embedded WXXW motif, is critical for anchoring Loh to the ECM. Two other thrombospondin repeats, TSR1-2 and TSR1-4, the latter containing a CXXTCXXG motif, appeared to be dispensable for tethering Loh to the ECM but were crucial for proper interaction with and recruitment of Pericardin.

Genetic Modifiers of Neurodegeneration in a Drosophila Model of Parkinson's Disease,29907646,10.1534/genetics.118.301119,"Disease phenotypes can be highly variable among individuals with the same pathogenic mutation. There is increasing evidence that background genetic variation is a strong driver of disease variability in addition to the influence of environment. To understand the genotype-phenotype relationship that determines the expressivity of a pathogenic mutation, a large number of backgrounds must be studied. This can be efficiently achieved using model organism collections such as the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). Here, we used the DGRP to assess the variability of locomotor dysfunction in a LRRK2 G2019S Drosophila melanogaster model of Parkinson's disease (PD). We find substantial variability in the LRRK2 G2019S locomotor phenotype in different DGRP backgrounds. A genome-wide association study for candidate genetic modifiers reveals 177 genes that drive wide phenotypic variation, including 19 top association genes. Genes involved in the outgrowth and regulation of neuronal projections are enriched in these candidate modifiers.

"Conditioned visual flight orientation in Drosophila: dependence on age, practice, and diet",10456076,10.1101/lm.3.1.49,"Orientation preferences for visual patterns can be conditioned in tethered flies (Drosophila melanogaster) at the flight simulator. In a reversal conditioning procedure using heat as reinforcement, flies can be trained to successively prefer different flight orientations with respect to the patterns. As in many learning paradigms, conditioned responses are highly variable. Although during training most flies reliably avoid the heat and the corresponding flight orientations, in subsequent learning tests without heat some show no consistent preference for the permissive orientations. We have started to investigate the interindividual differences in learning performance and describe here three significant variables: the age of the animals, their experience in the flight simulator prior to the experiment, and the composition of the fly food. Flies learn more reliably at 3-4 days than at 1-2 days of age but learning indices do not increase further in even older flies.

"Characterisation of vha26, the Drosophila gene for a 26 kDa E-subunit of the vacuolar ATPase",8765087,10.1016/0005-2736(96)00103-4,A Drosophila melanogaster gene and cDNA for the E-subunit of the V-ATPase were characterised. The deduced product has 226 amino acids and a molecular mass of 26.1 kDa. The gene is a single copy at 83B1-4 on chromosome 3R. The coding sequence is punctuated by three introns which do not align with those in Neurospora. The gene is ubiquitously expressed as an mRNA of 2.3 kb. but at lower levels in pupae.,1996,"Y Guo, Z Wang, A Carter, K Kaiser, J A Dow, Y Guo, Z Wang, A Carter, K Kaiser, J A Dow"
"Morewright (mwr), a new meiotic mutant of Drosophila melanogaster affecting nonexchange chromosome segregation",8978058,,"A new meiotic mutation, morewright (mwr) was identified by screening for new mutations that act as dominant enhancers of the dosage-sensitive Drosophila melanogaster female meiotic mutant, nodDTW.mwr is a recessive meiotic mutant, specifically impairing the segregation of nonexchange chromosomes. Cytological evidence suggests that the meiotic defect in mwr/mwr females is in homologue recognition because the chromosomes appear to be misaligned on an intact spindle. The mwr mutation was recovered during a screen of random P-element insertions on a chromosome with a single insertion located at 50C. The P-element insertion is a recessive female-sterile mutation. While excision of the P element from the mwr-bearing chromosome partially relieves the female sterility, the excisions retain the dominant nodDTW-enhancing activity. The mwr meiotic phenotype maps very close to the female-sterile P insertion. Thus the mwr locus appears to encode a function required for partner recognition in meiosis, although its relationship to the neighboring female-sterile mutation remains to be elucidated.",1996,"R S Rasooly, R S Rasooly"
"Genetic interactions of pokkuri with seven in absentia, tramtrack and downstream components of the sevenless pathway in R7 photoreceptor induction in Drosophila melanogaster",28306024,10.1007/BF00365799,"The sevenless (sev) cascade plays an inductive role in formation of the R7 photoreceptor, whilst the pokkuri (pok) and tramtrack (ttk) gene products are known to repress R7 induction in developing ommatidia of Drosophila melanogaster. To elucidate how these positive and negative signalling mechanisms co-operate in the normal fate determination of R7, genetic interactions of mutations in the pok locus with ttk and downstream elements of sev including Gap1, raf1, rolled (r1) and seven in absentia (sina) were examined. The eye phenotype of a weak hypomorph, pok 15, was enhanced dominantly by Gap1-mip, a recessive mutation in a gene encoding a down-regulator of Ras1, producing multiple R7 in ommatidia. Ras1 has been reported to activate r1-encoded mitrogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase via Raf1 that is associated physically with Rasl. Ommatidia of raf1 c110 and rl 2/rlEMS64 typically lacked R7 and a few outer photoreceptors. The pok 1 mutation suppressed dominantly the rafl c110 rl2/rlEMS64 eye phenotypes, allowing single R7 cells to develop in ommatidia. The rafl c110 mutation improved adult viability of pok 1 homozygotes. An in vitro experiment demonstrated that MAP kinase phosphorylates Pok protein. Ttk is a transcriptional repressor which binds to the regulatory sequence upstream of the fushi-tarazu (ftz), even skipped (eve) and engrailed (en) coding region. A reduced activity in ttk resulted in enhancement of the pok phenotype. ttk mutations produced extra R7 cells even in sina homozygotes whilst the pok mutation did not. This result indicates that Ttk represses R7 induction downstream of the sites where Pok and Sina function.",1996,"Daisuke Yamamoto, Itsuko Nihonmatsu, Takashi Matsuo, Hiroshi Miyamoto, Shunzo Kondo, Kanako Hirata, Yuko Ikegami, Daisuke Yamamoto, Itsuko Nihonmatsu, Takashi Matsuo, Hiroshi Miyamoto, Shunzo Kondo, Kanako Hirata, Yuko Ikegami"
Catecholamine metabolism and in vitro induction of premature cuticle melanization in wild type and pigmentation mutants of Drosophila melanogaster,8580497,10.1002/(SICI)1520-6327(1996)31:2<219::AID-ARCH9>3.0.CO;2-U,"The major pathway leading to adult cuticle melanization in Drosophila melanogaster has been investigated by a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches. By comparing catecholamine pools in newly emerged flies and in frass (excreta) collected 1 to 4 days after eclosion from wild type with those obtained from several pigmentation mutants, the major flow of catecholamines through the pathway to an unidentified final catabolite was determined. We also demonstrate that incubation with dopamine in vitro induces premature melanization in wild type unpigmented pharate adults several hours before the developmentally programmed onset of melanization, supporting the hypothesis that the availability of catecholamines may be the limiting factor determining the onset of melanization and that the major enzymatic activities that act downstream of dopa decarboxylase in the pathway are deposited into the cuticle before pigmentation begins. In vitro melanization studies with various pigmentation mutants that are associated with critical enzymatic steps in Drosophila catecholamine metabolism are consistent with their proposed function and suggest a central role of N-beta-alanyldopamine in adult cuticle pigmentation.",1996,"M F Walter, L L Zeineh, B C Black, W E McIvor, T R Wright, H Biessmann, M F Walter, L L Zeineh, B C Black, W E McIvor, T R Wright, H Biessmann"

Temperature and humidity were measured continuously at the site where Drosophila were observed throughout the day, and thus represent a realistic picture of the temperature environment of these animals. A phenotypic model (gaussian curve) of temperature performance was fitted to daily fecundities and provided estimates of the position of temperature optimum and of the maximum and the breadth of performance for both species.

Intraspecific nuclear DNA variation in Drosophila,8583899,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025563,"We have summarized and analyzed all available nuclear DNA sequence polymorphism studies for three species of Drosophila, D. melanogaster (24 loci), D. simulans (12 loci), and D. pseudoobscura (5 loci). Our major findings are: (1) The average nucleotide heterozygosity ranges from about 0.4% to 2% depending upon species and function of the region, i.e., coding or noncoding. (2) Compared to D. simulans and D. pseudoobscura (which are about equally variable), D. melanogaster displays a low degree of DNA polymorphism. (3) Noncoding introns and 3' and 5' flanking DNA shows less polymorphism than silent sites within coding DNA. (4) X-linked genes are less variable than autosomal genes. (5) Transition (Ts) and transversion (Tv) polymorphisms are about equally frequent in non-coding DNA and at fourfold degenerate sites in coding DNA while Ts polymorphisms outnumber Tv polymorphisms by about 2:1 in total coding DNA. The increased Ts polymorphism in coding regions is likely due to the structure of the genetic code: silent changes are more often Ts's than are replacement substitutions. (6) The proportion of replacement polymorphisms is significantly higher in D. melanogaster than in D. simulans. (7) The level of variation in coding DNA and the adjacent noncoding DNA is significantly correlated indicating regional effects, most notably recombination. (8) Surprisingly, the level of polymorphism at silent coding sites in D. melanogaster is positively correlated with degree of codon usage bias. (9) Three proposed tests of the neutral theory of DNA polymorphisms have been performed on the data: Tajima's test, the HKA test, and the McDonald-Kreitman test. About half of the loci fail to conform to the expectations of neutral theory by one of the tests. We conclude that many variables are affecting levels of DNA polymorphism in Drosophila, from properties of nucleotides to population history and, perhaps, mating structure.

THE DISTRIBUTION AMONG POPULATIONS IN PHENOTYPIC VARIANCE WITH INBREEDING,28565585,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03579.x,"The effects of inbreeding on the phenotypic variance within populations were measured in a set of 30 bottlenecked lines derived from a single source population of Drosophila melanogaster. Inbred lines had significant variance among lines in the amount of phenotypic variance within lines, for thorax length, and sternopleural bristle scores. When significance levels were corrected on an experimentwide basis, no line had significant increases in phenotypic variance for sternopleural bristle counts, although two lines had significant increases in thorax length variance. These results demonstrate that inbred lines cannot be treated as necessarily more uniform than outbred lines and that results on changes in variance due to inbreeding should be treated with caution unless there has been sufficient replication. These results also demonstrate the validity of an important assumption of models of evolution by variance-mediated mechanisms, such as the variance-induced peak-shift model.",1996,"Michael C Whitlock, Kevin Fowler, Michael C Whitlock, Kevin Fowler"
Deleterious effect of the melanotic tumour on the survival rate of Drosophila melanogaster female flies,9107138,10.2108/zsj.13.821,"The effect of melanotic tumour formation on the survival rate of female flies was investigated for a period of five weeks after eclosion in the C-104 mutant strain of Drosophila melanogaster, found in a natural population in Budapest. Melanotic tumours developed only in female flies in the vicinity of spermathecae. The incidence of tumour formation was higher in the dead females than in the living ones. This fact explicitly indicated that tumour formation has a deleterious effect on the survival rate and thus the life span of its carriers. It also implied that non-self recognition or self-defense reaction is accomplished at the expense of the organisms. The reason for the maintenance of this melanotic tumour gene in a natural population is discussed.",1996,"K Kosuda, K Kosuda"
Upregulation of the Drosophila 1731 retrotransposon long-terminal repeat by UV-B irradiation requires a short sequence in the U3 region,8611026,10.1006/abbi.1996.0068,"A 1731 is a Drosophila melanogaster retrotransposon, the transcripts of which decrease in Drosophila cells after treatment by the 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-OH), the steroid-molting hormone of insects. In order to analyze the regulation of the long terminal repeat (LTR) directed transcription by UV-B, S2 Drosophila cells were transfected with various chimeric constructs carrying the LTR of 1731 linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and then subjected to UV-B irradiation. The results demonstrated that the 1731 LTR is activated by UV-B irradiation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Using constructions expressing the reporter gene under the control of either the entire or deleted LTRs of 1731, we established that a sequence located in the U3 region was required for the retrotransposon to respond to UV-B. The cis-acting element is identical to the binding sequence of the dorsal transcription factors. In addition, the S2 Drosophila cell produced extracellular factor(s) in response to UV-B irradiation which activated the 1731 LTR in nonirradiated cells. This factor(s) was detected when responding cells were cocultured with inducing cells and when conditioned medium from irradiated cultures was added to the cell cultures.",1996,"E Faure, M Best-Belpomme, S Champion, E Faure, M Best-Belpomme, S Champion"

We have analyzed some behavioral and morphological parameters during the development of y mutants. Wild-type third instar larvae move in straighter paths than larvae of the same age homozygous for the y mutation. At 96 h of age, the tracks of y larvae have 10 times as many loops as tracks of wild-type larvae, and at 120 h of age, y larvae show bending behavior about 2.5 times more frequently than do wild-type. Consequently, they do not disperse as much as wild-type larvae. Concomitant with the behavioral changes, the larvae present a defect in the morphology of large chaetae in the larval denticle belts, particularly of 2nd and 3rd instars, both with light and scanning electron microscopes. These results suggest that a cuticular defect is probably involved in the abnormal locomotor activity observed in y larvae of Drosophila melanogaster.",1996,"N C Inestrosa, C E Sunkel, J Arriagada, J Garrido, R Godoy-Herrera, N C Inestrosa, C E Sunkel, J Arriagada, J Garrido, R Godoy-Herrera"
Spatial and temporal expression of 4f-rnp gene in Drosophila melanogaster,8983176,10.1046/j.1432-0436.1996.6120103.x,"We have recently discovered that a pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) encoded by the 4f-rnp gene in Drosophila melanogaster undergoes RNA editing by site-specific A-to-G conversions. In this report, we describe the spatial and temporal expression patterns of 4f-rnp mRNA transcripts during fly development. The 4f-rnp locus was mapped by polytene in situ hybridization experiments to the 4F1,2 bands at the distal tip of the X-chromosome, demonstrating that this gene is nuclear. We show that 4f-rnp is a single-copy gene by a combination of genomic Southern blot hybridization and restriction map analysis of clones isolated through chromosome walking techniques. Northern blot analysis indicates that two alternatively spliced messenger RNA transcripts, differing in length by 200-300 nucleotides, are synthesized in adult male and female flies, during embryogenesis and throughout the larval period. Using tissue in situ hybridization techniques that do not distinguish between the transcripts, we find that the distribution of 4f-rnp mRNAs is specific to germline tissue in the ovary, demonstrating that these transcripts are maternally produced. During embryogenesis, 4f-rnp transcripts are localized within cells of most tissues, but they have a very distinct localization pattern within the segmental ganglia of the central nervous system. We discuss the significance that RNA editing is expected to have for the predicted 4F-RNP protein products that may be expressed throughout fly development and in high abundance within the fly's central nervous system.",1996,"K A Hess, A A Simone, J P Petschek, K A Hess, A A Simone, J P Petschek"
Related enhancers in the intron of the beta1 tubulin gene of Drosophila melanogaster are essential for maternal and CNS-specific expression during embryogenesis,8692694,10.1093/nar/24.13.2543,"Expression of the beta1 tubulin gene of Drosophila melanogaster is under complex developmental control. For high levels of transcription in the embryonic central nervous system (CNS) different modules dispersed over 3 kb have to co-operate. Combination of a core promoter with either far upstream localized enhancer elements or, alternatively, with an enhancer from the intron results in expression limited to only a few neuronal cells. Cooperation of all three modules, however, leads to high level expression in most neuronal cells of the CNS. In the intron, we identified a 6 bp core element which is essential for transcription in the CNS, as well as an 8 bp element required for maternal expression. Interestingly, both motifs are quite similar, with CAAAAT as the CNS core and CAAAAAT as the maternal enhancer core. Specific binding of proteins from nuclear extracts to the CNS-specific element could be demonstrated. We suggest that the beta1 tubulin gene represents an ideal marker gene to elucidate connections between pro-neural or neurogenic genes and downstream target genes throughout the CNS.",1996,"J KÃ¶hler, S SchÃ¤fer-Preuss, D Buttgereit, J KÃ¶hler, S SchÃ¤fer-Preuss, D Buttgereit"
Direct repeats bind the EcR/USP receptor and mediate ecdysteroid responses in Drosophila melanogaster,8649409,10.1128/mcb.16.6.2977,"The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone plays a key role in the induction and modulation of morphogenetic events throughout Drosophila development. Previous studies have shown that a heterodimeric nuclear receptor composed of the EcR and USP proteins mediates the action of the hormone at the transcriptional through binding to palindromic ecdysteroid mediates the action of the hormone at the transcriptional level through binding to palindromic ecdysteroid response elements (EcREs) such as those present in the promoter of the hsp27 gene or the fat body-specific enhancer of the Fbp1 gene. We show that in addition to palindromic EcREs, the EcR/USP heterodimer can bind in vitro with various affinities to direct repetitions of the motif AGGTCA separated by 1 to 5 nucleotides (DR1 to DR5), which are known to be target sites for vertebrate nuclear receptors. At variance with the receptors, EcR/USP was also found to bind to a DR0 direct repeat with no intervening nucleotide. In cell transformation assays, direct repeats DR0 to DR5 alone can render the minimum viral tk or Drosophila Fbp1 promoter responsive to 20-hydroxyecdysone, as does the palindromic hsp27 EcRE. In a transgenic assay, however, neither the palindromic hsp27 element nor direct repeat DR3 alone can make the Fbp1 minimal promoter responsive to premetamorphic ecdysteroid peaks. In contrast, DR0 and DR3 elements, when substituted for the natural palindromic EcRE in the context of the Fbp1 enhancer, can drive a strong fat body-specific ecdysteroid response in transgenic animals. These results demonstrate that directly repeated EcR/USP binding sites are as effective as palindromic EcREs in vivo. They also provide evidence that additional flanking regulatory sequences are crucially required to potentiate the hormonal response mediated by both types of elements and specify its spatial and temporal pattern.",1996,"C Antoniewski, B Mugat, F Delbac, J A Lepesant, C Antoniewski, B Mugat, F Delbac, J A Lepesant"
