Dopaminergic modulation of motor neuron activity and neuromuscular function in Drosophila melanogaster,10327610,10.1016/s0305-0491(98)10160-8,"Dopamine is found in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues in the larval stage of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and functions as a signaling molecule in the nervous system. Although dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) were previously thought solely to be interneurons, recent studies suggest that dopamine may also act as a neuromodulator in humoral pathways. We examined both application of dopamine on intact larval CNS-segmental preparations and isolated neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Dopamine rapidly decreased the rhythmicity of the CNS motor activity. Application of dopamine on neuromuscular preparations of the segmental muscles 6 and 7 resulted in a dose-responsive decrease in the excitatory junction potentials (EJPs). With the use of focal, macro-patch synaptic current recordings the quantal evoked transmission showed a depression of vesicular release at concentrations of 10 microM. Higher concentrations (1 mM) produced a rapid decrement in evoked vesicular release. Dopamine did not alter the shape of the spontaneous synaptic currents, suggesting that dopamine does not alter the postsynaptic muscle fiber receptiveness to the glutaminergic motor nerve transmission. The effects are presynaptic in causing a reduction in the number of vesicles that are stimulated to be released due to neural activity.",1999,"R L Cooper, W S Neckameyer, R L Cooper, W S Neckameyer"
Isolation and characterization of insect PC2-like prohormone convertase cDNA,10469247,10.1046/j.1365-2583.1999.83113.x,"Endoproteolytic processing of large precursor molecules at basic amino acid residues plays an important role in the maturation of many hormones, neuropeptides and other regulatory proteins.

Different period gene repeats take 'turns' at fine-tuning the circadian clock,10629978,10.1098/rspb.1999.0920,"The repetitive region of the circadian clock gene period in Drosophila pseudoobscura consists predominantly of a pentapeptide sequence whose consensus is NSGAD. In D. melanogaster, this region is replaced by a dipeptide Thr-Gly repeat, which plays a role in the thermal stability of the circadian phenotype. The Thr-Gly repeat has been shown to form a type II or III beta-turn, whose conformational monomer is (Thr-Gly)3. Here we report, using conformational analyses, that both an NSGAD pentapeptide, and a polymer of the same sequence, form type II beta-turns. Thus two peptide sequences, whose amino-acid composition is very different, nevertheless form the same secondary structure. The implications of these structures for clock function are discussed.",1999,"V Guantieri, A Pepe, M Zordan, C P Kyriacou, R Costa, A M Tamburro, V Guantieri, A Pepe, M Zordan, C P Kyriacou, R Costa, A M Tamburro"
Evidence for complex mutations at microsatellite loci in Drosophila,10353904,,"Fifteen lines each of Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. sechellia were scored for 19 microsatellite loci. One to four alleles of each locus in each species were sequenced, and microsatellite variability was compared with sequence structure. Only 7 loci had their size variation among species consistent with the occurrence of strictly stepwise mutations in the repeat array, the others showing extensive variability in the flanking region compared to that within the microsatellite itself. Polymorphisms apparently resulting from complex nonstepwise mutations involving the microsatellite were also observed, both within and between species. Maximum number of perfect repeats and variance of repeat count were found to be strongly correlated in microsatellites showing an apparently stepwise mutation pattern. These data indicate that many microsatellite mutation events are more complex than represented even by generalized stepwise mutation models. Care should therefore be taken in inferring population or phylogenetic relationships from microsatellite size data alone. The analysis also indicates, however, that evaluation of sequence structure may allow selection of microsatellites that more closely match the assumptions of stepwise models.",1999,"I Colson, D B Goldstein, I Colson, D B Goldstein"
Genetic variation affecting heart rate in Drosophila melanogaster,10584556,10.1017/s0016672399003924,"Heart rate in pre-pupae of Drosophila melanogaster is shown to vary over a wide range from 2.5 to 3.7 beats per second. Quantitative genetic analysis of a sample of 11 highly inbred lines indicates that approaching one-quarter of the total variance in natural populations can be attributed to genetic differences between flies. A hypomorphic allele of the potassium channel gene ether-a-gogo, which is homologous to a human long-QT syndrome susceptibility gene (HERG), has a heart rate at the low end of the wild-type range, but this effect can be suppressed in certain wild-type genetic backgrounds. This study provides a baseline for investigation of pharmacological and other physiological influences on heart rate in the model organism, and implies that quantitative genetic dissection will provide insight into the molecular basis for variation in normal and arrhythmic heart function.",1999,"J Robbins, R Aggarwal, R Nichols, G Gibson, J Robbins, R Aggarwal, R Nichols, G Gibson"
"The tamas gene, identified as a mutation that disrupts larval behavior in Drosophila melanogaster, codes for the mitochondrial DNA polymerase catalytic subunit (DNApol-gamma125)",10581287,,"From a screen of pupal lethal lines of Drosophila melanogaster we identified a mutant strain that displayed a reproducible reduction in the larval response to light. Moreover, this mutant strain showed defects in the development of the adult visual system and failure to undergo behavioral changes characteristic of the wandering stage. The foraging third instar larvae remained in the food substrate for a prolonged period and died at or just before pupariation. Using a new assay for individual larval photobehavior we determined that the lack of response to light in these mutants was due to a primary deficit in locomotion. The mutation responsible for these phenotypes was mapped to the lethal complementation group l(2)34Dc, which we renamed tamas (translated from Sanskrit as ""dark inertia"").

Genetic characterization of cytological region 77A-D harboring the presenilin gene of Drosophila melanogaster,10581285,,"We performed a systematic lethal mutagenesis of the genomic region uncovered by Df(3L)rdgC-co2 (cytological interval 77A-D) to isolate mutations in the single known Presenilin (Psn) gene of Drosophila melanogaster. Because this segment of chromosome III has not been systematically characterized before, inter se complementation testing of newly recovered mutants was carried out. A total of 79 lethal mutations were isolated, representing at least 17 lethal complementation groups, including one corresponding to the Psn gene. Fine structure mapping of the genomic region surrounding the Psn transcription unit by transgenic rescue experiments allowed us to localize two of the essential loci together with Psn within an approximately 12-kb genomic DNA region. One of these loci, located 3' to Psn, encodes a Drosophila protein related to the yeast 60S ribosomal protein L10 precursor. We also determined which of the newly recovered lethal mutant groups correspond to previously isolated lethal P-element insertions, lethal inversion breakpoints, and lethal polo gene mutants. Point mutations were identified in all five recovered Psn alleles, one of which results in a single amino acid substitution G-E at a conserved residue in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the protein, suggesting an important functional role for this C-terminal domain of Presenilin. In addition, some viable mutations were recovered in the screen, including new alleles of the clipped and inturned loci.",1999,"N I Lukinova, V V Roussakova, M E Fortini, N I Lukinova, V V Roussakova, M E Fortini"
The acquisition of competence to respond to ecdysone in Drosophila is transcript specific,10354477,10.1016/s0925-4773(99)00028-3,"The steroid hormone ecdysone induces a precise sequence of gene activity in Drosophila melanogaster salivary glands in late third larval instar larvae. The acquisition of competence for this response does not result from a single event or pathway but requires factors that accumulate throughout the instar. Individual transcripts become competent to respond at different times and their expression is differentially affected in ecd1, dor22 and BR-C mutants. The induction of early-late transcripts, originally assumed to necessarily follow early transcripts, is partially independent of early transcript activation. Attempts to inhibit the synthesis of regulatory proteins reveal transcript-specific superinduction effects. Furthermore these inhibitors lead to the induction of betaFTZ-F1 and E93 transcripts at levels normally found in prepupal glands.

Selenium metabolism in Drosophila. Characterization of the selenocysteine tRNA population,10373487,10.1074/jbc.274.26.18729,"The selenocysteine (Sec) tRNA population in Drosophila melanogaster is aminoacylated with serine, forms selenocysteyl-tRNA, and decodes UGA. The Km of Sec tRNA and serine tRNA for seryl-tRNA synthetase is 6.67 and 9.45 nM, respectively. Two major bands of Sec tRNA were resolved by gel electrophoresis. Both tRNAs were sequenced, and their primary structures were indistinguishable and colinear with that of the corresponding single copy gene. They are 90 nucleotides in length and contain three modified nucleosides, 5-methylcarboxymethyluridine, N6-isopentenyladenosine, and pseudouridine, at positions 34, 37, and 55, respectively. Neither form contains 1-methyladenosine at position 58 or 5-methylcarboxymethyl-2'-O-methyluridine, which are characteristically found in Sec tRNA of higher animals. We conclude that the primary structures of the two bands of Sec tRNA resolved by electrophoresis are indistinguishable by the techniques employed and that Sec tRNAs in Drosophila may exist in different conformational forms.

The Canoe protein is necessary in adherens junctions for development of ommatidial architecture in the Drosophila compound eye,10639730,10.1007/s004419900107,"Rhabdomeres of the Drosophila melanogaster canoemisl mutant ommatidia were twisted, branched, and often fused to each other. A considerable proportion of rhabdomeres were found to have fallen below the retinal basement membrane. Electron-microscopic observations of the mutant ommatidia revealed that microvilli, the subcellular structures composing the rhabdome, were normal. As was the case with partial loss-of-function mutations in the canoe locus, overexpression of the wild-type canoe transgene driven by the heat shock promoter or sevenless enhancer in the wild-type canoe background caused malformation of the rhabdomeres in the adult ommatidia. Immunolabeling of the Canoe protein in the pupal retinae showed that it was accumulated in adherens junctions in photoreceptor rhabdomeres at high concentrations, as well as in pigment cells, bristle cells, and the interjunctional region of photoreceptors at a lower level. In the canoe mutant ommatidia, the Canoe protein concentration was dramatically decreased in adherens junctions, while it was maintained at a level comparable with the wild-type flies in the interjunctional region. Since Canoe or its mammalian homolog AF-6 is known to bind to F-actin and Ras, we suggest the possibility that Canoe couples Ras signaling with cytoskeleton, thereby supporting the straight elongation of rhabdomeres required for development of a regular array of ommatidia.",1999,"T Matsuo, K Takahashi, E Suzuki, D Yamamoto, T Matsuo, K Takahashi, E Suzuki, D Yamamoto"
Iron availability dramatically alters the distribution of ferritin subunit messages in Drosophila melanogaster,10077577,10.1073/pnas.96.6.2716,"Insect ferritins have subunits homologous to the heavy and light chains of vertebrate ferritins. Cloning and sequence of the heavy chain homologue (HCH) of Drosophila melanogaster ferritin subunit have been reported earlier. When Northern blots of D. melanogaster RNA were probed with a cDNA for this HCH, three bands were observed. It was shown that these represented at least four classes of mRNA of various lengths. The polymorphism results from alternative splicing of an intron in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) that contains the iron-responsive element (IRE) and from two alternative polyadenylation sites in the 3' UTR. This has also been reported by others [Lind, M. I., Ekengren, S., Melefors, O. & SÃ¶derhÃ¤ll, K. (1998) FEBS Lett. 436, 476-482]. By hybridizing Northern blots with specific probes, it has been shown that the relative proportions of the messages vary with the life stage and especially with iron supplementation of the diet. Iron significantly increases the amount of ferritin HCH messages and dramatically shifts the balance toward those messages that lack an IRE and/or have a short 3' UTR. In the larvae this change takes place in the gut, but not in the fat body. We speculate that this dramatic shift in message distribution may result from an effect of iron on the rate of transcription or message degradation, or from an effect on the splicing process itself. Synthesis of ferritin HCH subunit mRNAs that lack an IRE may be important under conditions of iron overload.",1999,"T Georgieva, B C Dunkov, N Harizanova, K Ralchev, J H Law, T Georgieva, B C Dunkov, N Harizanova, K Ralchev, J H Law"

Here, we describe a Drosophila gene, zimp, that encodes a protein with similarity to Miz1 and PIAS3. The zimp gene appears to be post-transcriptionally regulated, as three alternatively spliced forms are detected in a cDNA library screen and on an RNA blot. In addition, all three zimp transcripts are detected in embryonic mRNA, but only two of the transcripts are detected in adult mRNA. The three transcripts have the ability to encode two proteins, of 554 and 522 amino acids. The two Zimp amino acid sequences share an amino-terminal 515-amino-acid region and differ in their carboxy-termini. These proteins and related proteins in other organisms, including mammals, C. elegans, yeast, and plants, share a highly conserved region predicted to form a zinc finger. Deletion of the zimp gene or P-element insertion in zimp is lethal; thus, zimp is an essential gene in Drosophila. These data underscore the potential importance of Zimp-related proteins cross-species, and conservation of the putative zinc finger domain suggests that it is functionally important.",1999,"S E Mohr, R E Boswell, S E Mohr, R E Boswell"
Neuropeptide precursor processing detected by triple immunolabeling,10470489,10.1007/s004410051347,"Peptides that play critical physiological roles are often encoded in precursors that contain several gene products.

The peptides are encoded in the FMRFamide gene and have a common C-terminal FMRFamide but different N-terminal extensions. In order to investigate the regulation of expression of FMRFamide peptides, we generated antisera to distinguish between the structurally related neuropeptides. We established a triple-label immunofluorescence protocol using antisera raised in the same host species and mapped the neural distribution of SDNFMRFamide, DPKQDFMRFamide, and TPAEDFMRFamide.

Local transposition of a hobo element within the decapentaplegic locus of Drosophila,9872958,,"We have efficiently mobilized a phenotypically silent hobo transgene inserted within the cis-regulatory heldout region of the decapentaplegic (dpp) locus in Drosophila melanogaster. The goal of our experiment was to identify germline transmission of a local transposition event within the dpp locus that meets two specific criteria. First, excision of the hobo construct does not generate an adult mutant phenotype, suggesting minimal alteration to the original site of insertion. Second, we required a new insertion of the hobo transgene into the Haploinsufficient region of the locus approximately 25 kb away. Genetic and molecular criteria are used to evaluate candidate germlines. In a pilot study, this local transposition event occurred independently in two individuals. Both of the transposition events appear to be new insertions into the dpp transcription unit. One insertion is between the two protein-coding exons, and the other is in the 3'-untranslated region of exon three. Strains carrying these insertions are valuable new reagents for the analysis of dpp function and molecular evolution. These results further support the use of the hobo system as an important tool in Drosophila genetics.",1999,"S J Newfeld, N T Takaesu, S J Newfeld, N T Takaesu"
"Expression pattern and, surprisingly, gene length shape codon usage in Caenorhabditis, Drosophila, and Arabidopsis",10200288,10.1073/pnas.96.8.4482,"We measured the expression pattern and analyzed codon usage in 8,133, 1,550, and 2,917 genes, respectively, from Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Arabidopsis thaliana. In those three species, we observed a clear correlation between codon usage and gene expression levels and showed that this correlation is not due to a mutational bias. This provides direct evidence for selection on silent sites in those three distantly related multicellular eukaryotes. Surprisingly, there is a strong negative correlation between codon usage and protein length. This effect is not due to a smaller size of highly expressed proteins. Thus, for a same-expression pattern, the selective pressure on codon usage appears to be lower in genes encoding long rather than short proteins. This puzzling observation is not predicted by any of the current models of selection on codon usage and thus raises the question of how translation efficiency affects fitness in multicellular organisms.",1999,"L Duret, D Mouchiroud, L Duret, D Mouchiroud"

Elucidating the processing and activities of multiple FaRPs encoded in a single precursor is critical to establishing their roles in physiology. In this manuscript, we describe the distribution of FMRFamide immunoreactive materials in the Drosophila central nervous system and gut, and correlate it with the expression of specific FaRPs and their activities. The unique distributions and biological activities of Drosophila FaRPs suggest that the precursors are highly processed and the structurally related peptides are not functionally redundant. The complete distribution of FaRPs in the central nervous system and gut as detected by FMRFamide antisera is not accounted for by the sum of the individual expression patterns of the known Drosophila peptides.

Mammalian (cytosine-5) methyltransferases cause genomic DNA methylation and lethality in Drosophila,10545955,10.1038/15551,"CpG methylation is essential for mouse development as well as gene regulation and genome stability. Many features of mammalian DNA methylation are consistent with the action of a de novo methyltransferase that establishes methylation patterns during early development and the post-replicative maintenance of these patterns by a maintenance methyltransferase. The mouse methyltransferase Dnmt1 (encoded by Dnmt) shows a preference for hemimethylated substrates in vitro, making the enzyme a candidate for a maintenance methyltransferase. Dnmt1 also has de novo methylation activity in vitro, but the significance of this finding is unclear, because mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells contain a de novo methylating activity unrelated to Dnmt1 (ref. 10). Recently, the Dnmt3 family of methyltransferases has been identified and shown in vitro to catalyse de novo methylation. To analyse the function of these enzymes, we expressed Dnmt and Dnmt3a in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster. The absence of endogenous methylation in Drosophila facilitates detection of experimentally induced methylation changes. In this system, Dnmt3a functioned as a de novo methyltransferase, whereas Dnmt1 had no detectable de novo methylation activity. When co-expressed, Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a cooperated to establish and maintain methylation patterns.

Lines selected against L. boulardi showed large increases in resistance against all three parasitoid species, and showed similar levels of defense against A. tabida to the lines selected against that parasitoid. In contrast, lines selected against A. tabida showed a large increase in resistance to A. tabida and generally to L. heterotoma, but displayed only a small change in their ability to survive attack by L. boulardi.

The Drosophila melanogaster homologue of the Xeroderma pigmentosum D gene product is located in euchromatic regions and has a dynamic response to UV light-induced lesions in polytene chromosomes,10198066,10.1091/mbc.10.4.1191,"The XPD/ERCC2/Rad3 gene is required for excision repair of UV-damaged DNA and is an important component of nucleotide excision repair.

XPD has a 5'- to 3'-helicase activity and is a component of the TFIIH transcription factor, which is essential for RNA polymerase II elongation. We present here the characterization of the Drosophila melanogaster XPD gene (DmXPD). DmXPD encodes a product that is highly related to its human homologue. The DmXPD protein is ubiquitous during development. In embryos at the syncytial blastoderm stage, DmXPD is cytoplasmic. At the onset of transcription in somatic cells and during gastrulation in germ cells, DmXPD moves to the nuclei. Distribution analysis in polytene chromosomes shows that DmXPD is highly concentrated in the interbands, especially in the highly transcribed regions known as puffs. UV-light irradiation of third-instar larvae induces an increase in the signal intensity and in the number of sites where the DmXPD protein is located in polytene chromosomes, indicating that the DmXPD protein is recruited intensively in the chromosomes as a response to DNA damage.

Interspecific hybridization increases transposition rates of Osvaldo,10406110,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026182,"Several authors have postulated that genetic divergence between populations could result in genomic incompatibilities that would cause an increase in transposition in their hybrids, producing secondary effects such as sterility and therefore starting a speciation process. It has been demonstrated that transposition largely depends on intraspecific hybridization for P, hobo, and I elements in Drosophila melanogaster and for several elements, including long terminal repeat (LTR) and non-LTR retrotransposons, in D. virilis. However, in order to demonstrate the putative effect of transposable elements on speciation, high levels of transposition should also be induced in hybrids between species that could have been originated by this process and that are still able to interbreed. To test this hypothesis, we studied the transposition of the LTR retrotransposon Osvaldo in Drosophila buzzatii-Drosophila koepferae hybrids. We used a simple and robust experimental design, analyzing large samples of single-pair mate offspring, which allowed us to detect new insertions by in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes. In order to compare transposition rates, we also used a stock recently obtained from the field and a highly inbred D. buzzatii strain. Our results show that the transposition rate of Osvaldo is 10(-3) transpositions per element per generation in all nonhybrid samples, very high when compared with those of other transposable elements.

Sequence comparison between species has identified putative cis-acting elements important for each RNA editing site. Double-stranded RNA secondary structures with striking similarity to known RNA editing sites were generated based on these data. In addition, the RNA editing sites appear to be developmentally regulated. We have cloned a potential RNA editase, DRED, with a high degree of homology to the mammalian RED1,2 genes.

EXPERIMENTAL EVOLUTION OF HSP70 EXPRESSION AND THERMOTOLERANCE IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,28565421,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1999.tb03783.x,"To examine whether recent evolutionary history affects the expression of Hsp70, the major heat-induced-heat shock protein in Drosophila melanogaster, we measured Hsp70 expression, thermotolerance, and hsp70 gene number in replicate populations undergoing laboratory evolution at different temperatures. Despite Hsp70's ancient and highly conserved nature, experimental evolution effectively and replicably modified its expression and phenotype (thermotolerance). Among five D. melanogaster populations founded from a common ancestral population and raised at three different temperatures (one at 18Â°C, two each at 25Â°C and 28Â°C) for twenty years, Hsp70 expression varies in a consistent pattern: the replicate 28Â°C lines expressed 30-50% less Hsp70 than the other lines at a range of inducing temperatures. This modification was refractory to acclimation, and correlated with thermotolerance: the 28Â°C lines had significantly lower inducible tolerance of 38.5Â°C and 39Â°C. We verified the presence of five hsp70 genes in the genome of each line, excluding copy number variation as a candidate molecular basis of the evolved difference in expression. These findings support the ability of Hsp70 levels in D. melanogaster populations to change over microevolutionary time scales and implicate constancy of environmental temperature as a potentially important selective agent.",1999,"Brian R Bettencourt, Martin E Feder, Sandro Cavicchi"

Preimaginal conditioning in Drosophila revisited,10479377,10.1006/anbe.1999.1169,"During metamorphosis, the nervous system of a holometabolous insect changes significantly. Attempts to demonstrate preimaginal conditioning, here taken to mean the retention of learning through metamorphosis, have given mixed results. We used two behavioural assays (the T maze and trap assay) to see whether a change in adult responsiveness could be induced by exposing Drosophila melanogaster larvae to a conditioning stimulus. There was no evidence for preimaginal conditioning from either assay, but the trap assay demonstrated that menthol contamination from the larval environment on the puparial surface could induce a change in adult behaviour. Exposure of adult insects to this contamination could give the appearance of preimaginal conditioning, when in fact the behavioural induction occurred during the adult stage. Young flies responded less strongly than older flies to the odour cues in both assays. This may explain the apparently contradictory findings of some earlier studies of preimaginal conditioning.

"Isolation and characterization of drosocrystallin, a lens crystallin gene of Drosophila melanogaster",10049575,10.1006/dbio.1998.9170,"We have cloned the drosocrystallin gene (dcy) of Drosophila melanogaster, which encodes a major protein of the corneal lens, previously described in part by Komori et al. (1992, J. Cell Sci. 102, 191-201). Synthesis of the DCY protein starts weakly in 2-day-old pupae, reaches a peak at day 3 and day 4 of pupal development, and decreases very fast in young adults. The dcy mRNA is detected in the compound eyes as well as in the ocelli. The presence of a putative signal peptide and the extracellular location of DCY suggest that DCY is a secreted protein. Interestingly, the dcy gene shows sequence similarities to some insect cuticular proteins and is detected as well in two closely related Drosophila species, D. sechellia and D. simulans, and in one more distantly related species, D. virilis. This finding supports the hypothesis that Drosophila used the same strategy as vertebrates and mollusks, namely, recruiting a multifunctional protein for refraction in the lens, by a gene-sharing mechanism. Furthermore, it supports our intercalary evolution hypothesis, which suggests that the development of an elaborate structure (for example, a compound eye) from an original primitive form (an ancestral photoreceptor organ) can be achieved by recruiting novel genes into the original developmental pathway.",1999,"H Janssens, W J Gehring, H Janssens, W J Gehring"
Wingless signaling leads to an asymmetric response to decapentaplegic-dependent signaling during sense organ patterning on the notum of Drosophila melanogaster,10049571,10.1006/dbio.1998.9149,"Wnt and Decapentaplegic cell signaling pathways act synergistically in their contribution to macrochaete (sense organ) patterning on the notum of Drosophila melanogaster. The Wingless-signaling pathway was ectopically activated by removing Shaggy activity (the homologue of vertebrate glycogen synthase kinase 3) in mosaics. Proneural activity is asymmetric within the Shaggy-deficient clone of cells and shows a fixed ""polarity"" with respect to body axis, independent of the precise location of the clone. This asymmetric response indicates the existence in the epithelium of a second signal, which we suggest is Decapentaplegic. Ectopic expression of Decapentaplegic induces extra macrochaetes only in cells which also receive the Wingless signal. Activation of Hedgehog signaling generates a long-range signal which can promote macrochaete formation in the Wingless activity domain. This signal depends upon decapentaplegic function. Autonomous activation of the Wingless signal response in cells causes them to attenuate or sequester this signal. Our results suggest a novel patterning mechanism which determines sense organ positioning in Drosophila.",1999,"R G Phillips, N L Warner, J R Whittle, R G Phillips, N L Warner, J R Whittle"
"Lava lamp, a novel peripheral golgi protein, is required for Drosophila melanogaster cellularization",11076973,10.1083/jcb.151.4.905,"Drosophila cellularization and animal cell cytokinesis rely on the coordinated functions of the microfilament and microtubule cytoskeletal systems. To identify new proteins involved in cellularization and cytokinesis, we have conducted a biochemical screen for microfilament/microtubule-associated proteins (MMAPs). 17 MMAPs were identified; seven have been previously implicated in cellularization and/or cytokinesis, including KLP3A, Anillin, Septins, and Dynamin. We now show that a novel MMAP, Lava Lamp (Lva), is also required for cellularization. Lva is a coiled-coil protein and, unlike other proteins previously implicated in cellularization or cytokinesis, it is Golgi associated. Our functional analysis shows that cellularization is dramatically inhibited upon injecting anti-Lva antibodies (IgG and Fab) into embryos. In addition, we show that brefeldin A, a potent inhibitor of membrane trafficking, also inhibits cellularization. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that Lva physically interacts with the MMAPs Spectrin and CLIP190. We suggest that Lva and Spectrin may form a Golgi-based scaffold that mediates the interaction of Golgi bodies with microtubules and facilitates Golgi-derived membrane secretion required for the formation of furrows during cellularization. Our results are consistent with the idea that animal cell cytokinesis depends on both actomyosin-based contraction and Golgi-derived membrane secretion.",2000,"J C Sisson, C Field, R Ventura, A Royou, W Sullivan, J C Sisson, C Field, R Ventura, A Royou, W Sullivan"

Larvae of many Drosophila species can defend themselves against attack by parasitoids through a cellular immune response called encapsulation. The paper reviews recent studies of the evolutionary biology and ecological genetics of resistance in Drosophila, concentrating on D. melanogaster. The physiological basis of encapsulation, and the genes known to interfere with resistance are briefly summarized. Evidence for within- and between-population genetic variation in resistance from isofemale line, artificial selection and classical genetic studies are reviewed. There is now firm evidence that resistance is costly to Drosophila, and the nature of this cost is discussed, and the possibility that it may involve a reduction in metabolic rate considered. Comparative data on encapsulation and metabolic rates across seven Drosophila species provides support for this hypothesis. Finally, the possible population and community ecological consequences of evolution in the levels of host resistance are examined.",2000,"M D Fellowes, H C Godfray, M D Fellowes, H C Godfray"

Using the two-hybrid system, we have isolated a number of cDNAs that are related to a previously published cDNA encoding the beta subunit, but exhibit divergent 5' sequences. To determine the source of this sequence variation, we have isolated the gene encoding the beta subunit of CKII. The beta gene contains five exons encompassing the complete open reading frame, as well as five alternative exons in the 5' untranslated region (UTR). Only one 5' UTR exon is contained in each cDNA, implying five distinct classes of transcript. In addition, the beta gene contains at least two poly(A) addition signals which generate additional complexity at the 3' end. The complex pattern of transcription may serve a role in the spatial and/or temporal expression of the beta subunit since, with one exception, all transcripts encode the full-length beta polypeptide.

Mutations in D-Titin cause chromosome undercondensation, chromosome breakage, loss of diploidy, and premature sister chromatid separation. Additionally, D-Titin mutants have defects in myoblast fusion and muscle organization.

Sexual dimorphism in diverse metazoans is regulated by a novel class of intertwined zinc fingers,10898790,,"Sex determination is regulated by diverse pathways. Although upstream signals vary, a cysteine-rich DNA-binding domain (the DM motif) is conserved within downstream transcription factors of Drosophila melanogaster (Doublesex) and Caenorhabditis elegans (MAB-3). Vertebrate DM genes have likewise been identified and, remarkably, are associated with human sex reversal (46, XY gonadal dysgenesis). Here we demonstrate that the structure of the Doublesex domain contains a novel zinc module and disordered tail. The module consists of intertwined CCHC and HCCC Zn(2+)-binding sites; the tail functions as a nascent recognition alpha-helix. Mutations in either Zn(2+)-binding site or tail can lead to an intersex phenotype. The motif binds in the DNA minor groove without sharp DNA bending. These molecular features, unusual among zinc fingers and zinc modules, underlie the organization of a Drosophila enhancer that integrates sex- and tissue-specific signals. The structure provides a foundation for analysis of DM mutations affecting sexual dimorphism and courtship behavior.",2000,"L Zhu, J Wilken, N B Phillips, U Narendra, G Chan, S M Stratton, S B Kent, M A Weiss, L Zhu, J Wilken, N B Phillips, U Narendra, G Chan, S M Stratton, S B Kent, M A Weiss"

In the last step, from the set of predicted exons, the gene structure is assembled, maximizing the sum of the scores of the assembled exons.

This has allowed the study of the organization and expression of Adhr: in Drosophila buzzatii. We find that in D. buzzatii Adhr is transcribed as a monocistronic transcript. Adh and Adhr are believed to originate by duplication, and our data suggest that the cotranscription of these two genes was the primitive state, and that their independent transcription in the subgenus Drosophila is derived. We can rationalize the D. buzzatii condition as being correlated with the two genes evolving independent transcriptional control.

Tissue lesions caused by microplanar beams of synchrotron-generated X-rays in Drosophila melanogaster,10815638,10.1080/095530000138583,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      To examine tissue lesions caused by microplanar beams of synchrotron-generated X-rays in Drosophila melanogaster using stereomicroscopy, light and electron microscopy.
    

    
  


        Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Pupae were irradiated by 25-microm wide, 1.175 mm-high parallel microplanes at 100 microm on-centre intervals, at 20, 24, 32, 36, 48 or 72 h of development, with absorbed doses per microplane between 75 and 3,000 Gy.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Transverse or longitudinal irradiation with in-slice absorbed doses of 75 or 375 Gy caused no recognizable effects. All pupae irradiated at or after 48 h developed normally. Conversely, the development to adulthood was delayed in 90% of pupae irradiated at 24h with doses of 750 Gy. However, neither those pupae nor adults that hatched after pupal irradiation at 48 and 72 h displayed morphological changes. Pupae exposed at 48 h of development to 3,000 Gy developed into adults with sharply delimited lesions in the irradiated microplanes of the compound eye or the cuticle of wings and abdomen.

It was possible to induce catalase expression by administering exogenous 20-hydroxyecdysone (Ec) in culture at certain stages of development (usually at time points corresponding to previously observed hormone and catalase peaks). Experiments with exogenous administration of Ec, cycloheximide, and actinomycin D suggest a complex interplay of factors affecting catalase expression. In cultured third instar larvae, superinduction of catalase occurred in the presence of both Ec and cycloheximide. If ecdysteroid production was suppressed prior to antibiotic treatment by temperature upshift of the conditional mutant dre4(e55), superinduction occurred mostly at the protein level.

In support of this we show that in adult Drosophila melanogaster, with a deficiency in the anti-oxidant enzyme Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (Sod), an increase in oxidative stress, and a shortened life span, there is acceleration in the normal age-related temporal pattern of wingless gene expression. The acceleration in the temporal pattern of wingless gene expression is proportional to the shortened life span suggesting that the shortened life span of Sod deficient animals is due, not to an abnormal pathological process, but to an increase in the rate of aging.",2000,"B Rogina, S L Helfand, B Rogina, S L Helfand"
Function of RRM domains of Drosophila melanogaster ELAV: Rnp1 mutations and rrm domain replacements with ELAV family proteins and SXL,10924474,,"Members of the ELAV family of proteins contain three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are highly conserved.

A stringent genetic complementation test revealed that when the mutant protein was the sole source of ELAV, RNA-binding ability of each RRM was essential to ELAV function. To assess the degree to which each domain was specific for ELAV function and which domains perhaps performed a function common to related ELAV proteins, we substituted an ELAV RRM with the corresponding RRM from RBP9, the D. melanogaster protein most homologous to ELAV; HuD, a human ELAV family protein; and SXL, which, although evolutionarily related, is not an ELAV family member. This analysis revealed that RRM3 replacements were fully functional, but RRM1 and RRM2 replacements were largely nonfunctional.

These results are qualitatively consistent with results from a companion study in which age-specific mortality was assayed on the same lines of D. melanogaster. By contrast, effects of fecundity were confined to late ages after 20 generations of mutation accumulation, but by generation 30, as with male mating ability, effects of novel mutations were distributed across all age classes.

In this paper, we report on insect immunophilin FKBP46 and its associated kinase. The insect FKBP46 belongs to the high-molecular-weight immunophilins and shares many characteristic features with its mammalian counterparts, but its functional role remains unclear. Here, we show that FKBP46 is phosphorylated by a protein kinase present in the nucleus of both insect Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) and human Jurkat cells. This protein kinase is immunoreactive with polyclonal antiserum raised against Drosophila melanogaster casein kinase II (CKII). We have cloned, overexpressed and characterized a new member of the CKII family derived from Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Recombinant Sf9 CKII alpha subunit shares 75% identity to human, chicken and Drosophila melanogaster homologs, whereas the Sf9 CKII beta subunit is 77% identical to rat, chicken and human. Moreover, we demonstrate that the insect immunophilin FKBP46 can be phosphorylated by human and Sf9 casein kinase II. Finally, we show that FKBP46 interacts with DNA, and this interaction is not prevented by phosphorylation.",2000,"A Steplewski, W Ebel, S L Planey, E S Alnemri, N M Robertson, G Litwack, A Steplewski, W Ebel, S L Planey, E S Alnemri, N M Robertson, G Litwack"
Genetic control of acute ethanol-induced behaviors in Drosophila,10968649,,"Background:
      
    

    
      In most organisms in which acute ethanol exposure has been studied, it leads to similar changes in behavior. Generally, low ethanol doses activate the central nervous system, whereas high doses are sedative. Sensitivity to the acute intoxicating effects of ethanol is in part under genetic control in rodents and humans, and reduced sensitivity in humans predicts the development of alcoholism (Crabbe et al., 1994; Schuckit, 1994). We have established Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to study the mechanisms that regulate acute sensitivity to ethanol.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      We measured the effects of ethanol vapor on Drosophila locomotor behaviors by using three different assays. Horizontal locomotion was quantified in a locomotor chamber, turning behavior was assayed in narrow tubes, and ethanol-induced loss of postural control was measured in an inebriometer. Mutants with altered sensitivity to the acute effects of ethanol were generated by treatment with ethyl methane sulfonate and isolated by selection in the inebriometer. We ascertained the effects of these mutations on ethanol pharmacokinetics by measuring ethanol levels in extracts of flies at various times during and after ethanol exposure.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Among nearly 30,000 potentially mutant flies tested, we isolated 19 mutant strains with reduced and 4 strains with increased sensitivity to the acute effects of ethanol as measured in the inebriometer. Of these mutants, four showed changes in ethanol absorption. Two mutants, named barfly and tipsy to reflect their reduced and increased ethanol sensitivity in the inebriometer, respectively, were analyzed for locomotor behaviors. Both mutants exhibited ethanol-induced hyperactivity that was indistinguishable from wild type. However, barfly and tipsy displayed reduced and increased sensitivity to the sedative effects of ethanol, respectively. Finally, both mutants showed an increased rate of ethanol-induced turning behavior.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The effects of acute ethanol exposure on Drosophila locomotor behaviors are remarkably similar to those described for mammals. The analysis of mutants with altered sensitivity to ethanol revealed that the genetic pathways which regulate these responses are complex and that single genes can affect hyperactivity, turning, and sedation independently.",2000,"C M Singh, U Heberlein, C M Singh, U Heberlein"
Comparative genomics of mitochondrial DNA in members of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup,10903372,10.1007/s002390010066,"In this study, a comparative genomics approach is employed to investigate the forces that shape evolutionary change in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of members of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. This approach facilitates differentiation of the patterns of variation resulting from processes acting at a higher level from those acting on a single gene. The mitochondrial genomes of three isofemale lines of D. simulans (siI, -II, and -III), two of D. melanogaster (Oregon R and a line from Zimbabwe), and D. mauritiana (maI and -II), and one of D. sechellia were sequenced and compared with that derived from D. yakuba. Data presented here indicate that at least three broad mechanisms shape the evolutionary dynamics of mtDNA in these taxa. The first set of mechanisms is intrinsic to the molecule. Dominant processes may be interpreted as selection for an increased rate of replication of the mtDNA molecule, biases in DNA repair, and differences in the pattern of nucleotide substitution among strands. In the genes encoded on the major strand (62% of the coding DNA) changes to or from C predominate, whereas on the minor changes to or from G predominate. The second set of mechanisms affects distinct lineages. There are evolutionary rate differences among lineages, possibly owing to population demographic changes or changes in mutational biases. This is supported by the heterogeneity found in synonymous, nonsynonymous, and silent substitutions. The third set of mechanisms differentially affects distinct genes. A maximum-likelihood sliding-window analysis detected four disjunct regions that have a significantly different nucleotide substitution process from that derived from the complete sequence. These data show the potential for comparative genomics to tease apart subtle forces that shape the evolution of DNA.",2000,"J W Ballard, J W Ballard"
Anopheles stephensi Dox-A2 shares common ancestry with genes from distant groups of eukaryotes encoding a 26S proteasome subunit and is in a conserved gene cluster,10835480,10.1007/s002390010053,"The sequence of a cloned Anopheles stephensi gene showed 72% inferred amino acid identity with Drosophila melanogaster Dox-A2 and 93% with its putative ortholog in Anopheles gambiae. Dox-A2 is the reported but herein disputed structural locus for diphenol oxidase A2. Database searches identified Dox-A2 related gene sequences from 15 non-insect species from diverse groups. Phylogenetic trees based on alignments of inferred protein sequences, DNA, and protein motif searches and protein secondary structure predictions produced results consistent with expectations for genes that are orthologous. The only inconsistency was that the C-terminus appears to be more primitive in the yeasts than in plants. In mammals, plants, and yeast these genes have been shown to code for a non-ATPase subunit of the PA700 (19S) regulatory complex of 26S proteasome. The analyses indicated that the insect genes contain no divergent structural features, which taken within an appraisal of all available data, makes the reported alternative function highly improbable. A plausible additional role, in which the 26S proteasome is implicated in regulation of phenol oxidase, would also apply to at least the mammalian genes. No function has yet been reported for the other included sequences. These were from genome projects and included Caenorhabiditus elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Fugu rubripes, and Toxoplasma gondii. A consensus of the results predicts a protein containing exceptionally long stretches of helix with a hydrophilic C-terminus. Phosphorylation site motifs were identified at two conserved positions. Possible SRY and GATA-1 binding motifs were found at conserved positions upstream of the mosquito genes. The location of A. stephensi Dox-A2 was determined by in situ hybridization at 34D on chromosome arm 3R. It is in a conserved gene cluster with respect to the other insects. However, the A. stephensi cluster contains a gene showing significant sequence identity to human and pigeon carnitine acetyltransferase genes, therefore showing divergence with the distal end of the D. melanogaster cluster.",2000,"C F Garvey, C A Malcolm, C F Garvey, C A Malcolm"
The mus308 locus of Drosophila melanogaster is implicated in the bypass of ENU-induced O-alkylpyrimidine adducts,10732683,10.1007/s004380050041,"The mus308 locus of D. melanogaster was originally characterized by virtue of a mutant phenotype that resulted in specific hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents. However, the gene product has also been implicated in the repair of lesions other than cross-links. The gene was recently sequenced, and it encodes a protein with motifs characteristic of both DNA polymerases and helicases. We present mutability studies, using the recessive lethal (RL) test, which show that N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) induces hypermutability in mus308-deficient conditions, although only in early broods. Further studies elucidated the role of MUS308 in repair processes by characterizing the spectrum of molecular mutations induced by in vivo ENU in postmeiotic germ cells, in mus308 conditions. These revealed that, in comparison to repair-proficient conditions, there is an increase in the frequency of GC --> AT and AT --> GC transitions, and AT --> TA transversions. Moreover, frameshift mutations, which have not previously been reported to form part of the ENU spectrum, were also found. These results indicate that MUS308 is needed to process ENU-induced lesions, and support the hypothesis that the mus308 gene plays a role in post-replication bypass of O-alkylpyrimidines, probably mediated by recombination, which serves to increase the time available for error-free repair of these persistent and highly mutagenic lesions.",2000,"L Tosal, M A Comendador, L M Sierra, L Tosal, M A Comendador, L M Sierra"

Northern blot analysis using RNAs derived from 32Dcl3 cells that have been grown in the absence of IL-3 demonstrates that the G1RP message is upregulated in these cells following the removal of IL-3, suggesting that this gene may regulate growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis of myeloid precursor cells.",2000,"S J Baker, E P Reddy, S J Baker, E P Reddy"
Pericentromeric regions containing 1.688 satellite DNA sequences show anti-kinetochore antibody staining in prometaphase chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster,11129040,10.1007/s004380000331,A striking characteristic of the centromeric heterochromatin of Drosophila melanogaster is that each chromosome carries different satellite DNA sequences.

Transcriptional activity of Drosophila melanogaster ecdysone receptor isoforms and ultraspiracle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,10750019,10.1677/jme.0.0240183,"The Drosophila melanogaster ecdysone receptor (EcR) is produced in three isoforms, which mediate developmental processes such as metamorphosis. These isoforms were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to elucidate aspects of receptor transcription activity in a highly defined genetic model system. All three EcR isoforms showed ligand-independent transcriptional activation of an ecdysone reporter gene and the amount of activation correlated with the size of the N-terminal A/B (transactivation) domain present in the isoform: EcR-B1>EcR-A>>EcR-B2. Upon co-expression with ultraspiracle (Usp), transcriptional activation was further increased with EcR-B1 or EcR-A, but was unchanged with EcR-B2 or a truncated EcR lacking the A/B N-terminal domain (EcRDeltaA/B). Thus, the enhanced activity from Usp may depend on the presence of an N-terminal domain of EcR. Co-expression with Usp of several chimeric receptors of the EcR and the mouse androgen receptor (mAR) identified one chimera, composed of the mAR N-terminus and the remainder from EcR (mARÂ¿EcR-CDEF) that was transcriptionally silent and inducible by Usp. In contrast, the vertebrate homologue, human retinoic acid receptor (RXRalpha), showed ligand-independent transcription when co-expressed with EcRDeltaA/B but not mARÂ¿ EcR-CDEF. Therefore, RXRalpha does not require its partner to possess an N-terminal domain, yet is intolerant of a heterologous N-terminus. Similarly, the human vitamin D receptor, which has a short N-terminal region, showed greater ligand-independent transcription in the presence of RXRalpha than in the presence of Usp. These results reveal a mechanistic basis for the differential activities among the EcR isoforms, and between Usp and RXRalpha. Furthermore, they provided the foundation for a genetic screen to identify potential insecticides as well as accessory proteins for Usp and EcR.",2000,"F E Dela Cruz, D R Kirsch, J N Heinrich, F E Dela Cruz, D R Kirsch, J N Heinrich"
polyhomeotic controls engrailed expression and the hedgehog signaling pathway in imaginal discs,10906453,10.1016/s0925-4773(00)00342-7,"Polycomb group (PcG) genes maintain cell identities during development in insects and mammals and their products are required in many developmental pathways. These include limb morphogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, since PcG genes interact with identity and pattern specifying genes in imaginal discs and clones of polyhomeotic (ph) null cells induce abnormal limb patterning. Such clones are associated with ectopic expression of engrailed, hedgehog, patched, cubitus interruptus and decapentaplegic, in a compartment specific manner. Our results also reveal negative engrailed regulation by ph in both disc compartments: ph silences engrailed in anterior cells and maintains the level of engrailed expression in posterior ones. We suggest that PcG targets are not exclusively regulated by an on/off mechanism, but that the PcG also exerts negative transcriptional control on active genes.",2000,"N B Randsholt, F Maschat, P Santamaria, N B Randsholt, F Maschat, P Santamaria"

DDP1 contains 15 consecutive KH domains and is homologous to the highly conserved vigilin proteins that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are involved in the control of cell ploidy. DDP1 was identified and purified on the basis of its binding to the pyrimidine-rich C strand of the centromeric Drosophila dodeca-satellite. Here, the interaction of DDP1 with the dodeca-satellite C strand was analyzed in detail. This interaction is sequence specific. In particular, a guanine residue which is highly conserved in natural dodeca-satellite sequences was found to be essential for the efficient binding of DDP1. DDP1 binding was also found to be strongly influenced by the length and extent of secondary structure of the DNA substrate. Efficient DDP1 binding required a minimal length of about 75 to 100 nucleotides and was facilitated by the lack of secondary structure of the substrate. DDP1 also showed a significant affinity for the unstructured pyrimidine-rich strand of the most abundant centromeric Drosophila AAGAG satellite. The stoichiometry of the complexes formed with the dodeca-satellite C strand suggests that, in DDP1, the 15 consecutive KH domains are organized such that they define two nucleic acid binding surfaces. These results are discussed in the context of the possible contribution of DDP1 to heterochromatin organization and function.",2000,"A CortÃ©s, F AzorÃ­n, A CortÃ©s, F AzorÃ­n"
A mild stress due to hypergravity exposure at young age increases longevity in Drosophila melanogaster males,11707930,10.1023/a:1010043914016,"Drosophila melanogaster flies were exposed to hypergravity starting at two days of age, the range of gravity levels used being 2.58-7.38 g.

This increase in longevity was never observed in females. The positive effect of exposure to hypergravity has been replicated in two laboratories using two wild-type strains and different rearing conditions.

A Drosophila mechanosensory transduction channel,10744543,10.1126/science.287.5461.2229,"Mechanosensory transduction underlies a wide range of senses, including proprioception, touch, balance, and hearing. The pivotal element of these senses is a mechanically gated ion channel that transduces sound, pressure, or movement into changes in excitability of specialized sensory cells. Despite the prevalence of mechanosensory systems, little is known about the molecular nature of the transduction channels. To identify such a channel, we analyzed Drosophila melanogaster mechanoreceptive mutants for defects in mechanosensory physiology. Loss-of-function mutations in the no mechanoreceptor potential C (nompC) gene virtually abolished mechanosensory signaling. nompC encodes a new ion channel that is essential for mechanosensory transduction.

Genetic analysis of speciation by means of introgression into Drosophila melanogaster,10706624,10.1073/pnas.050558597,"In the last decade, the genetic basis of reproductive isolation has been shown to be surprisingly polygenic, and yet even the most efficient system currently in use could lend itself to molecular analysis only in highly selected cases. By extending the recent discovery of fertility rescue between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, we show that this hybridization can permit systematic and precise delineation of the genetic and molecular basis of speciation. In a region of 5% of the D. simulans genome introgressed into D. melanogaster, we discover at least six genes of hybrid male sterility and none for female sterility by deficiency mapping. A single case of hybrid inviability has been tracked down to a 3-Kb element that was inserted into the Cyclin E locus during species hybridization. The extent of interspecific genetic divergence underlying hybrid male sterility, especially in contrast with the low degree of inviability and female sterility, is far greater than expected from previous studies.",2000,"K Sawamura, A W Davis, C I Wu"
An extracellular activator of the Drosophila JAK/STAT pathway is a sex-determination signal element,10879541,10.1038/35016119,"Metazoans use diverse and rapidly evolving mechanisms to determine sex. In Drosophila melanogaster an X-chromosome-counting mechanism determines the sex of an individual by regulating the master switch gene, Sex-lethal (Sxl). The X-chromosome dose is communicated to Sxl by a set of X-linked signal elements (XSEs), which activate transcription of Sxl through its 'establishment' promoter, SxlPe. Here we describe a new XSE called sisterlessC (sisC) whose mode of action differs from that of previously characterized XSEs, all of which encode transcription factors that activate SxlPe directly. In contrast, sisC encodes a secreted ligand for the Drosophila Janus kinase (JAK) and 'signal transducer and activator of transcription' (STAT) signal transduction pathway and is allelic to outstretched (os, also called unpaired). We conclude that sisC works indirectly on Sxl through this signalling pathway because mutations in sisC or in the genes encoding Drosophila JAK or STAT reduce expression of SxlPe similarly. The involvement of os in sex determination confirms that secreted ligands can function in cell-autonomous processes. Unlike sex signals for other organisms, sisC has acquired its sex-specific function while maintaining non-sex-specific roles in development, a characteristic that it shares with all other Drosophila XSEs.",2000,"L Sefton, J R Timmer, Y Zhang, F BÃ©ranger, T W Cline, L Sefton, J R Timmer, Y Zhang, F BÃ©ranger, T W Cline"

By multimerizing a conserved Sxl-Pe sequence block, we generated a gain-of-function promoter, Sxl-PeGOF, that is inappropriately active in 1X/2A nuclei. GOF activity requires the X-linked unpaired (upd) gene, which encodes a ligand for the Drosophila JAK/STAT signaling pathway. upd also functions as a numerator element in regulating wild-type Sxl-Pe reporters.

Data suggests that YPs from the follicle cells are trafficked into the oocyte during early stages of vitellogenesis, and that hemolymph YPs are sequestered by nurse cells adjacent to the developing oocyte during late stages of vitellogenesis. Yolk proteins were immunolocalized to both follicle cells and nurse cells during these processes.

RotundRacGAP functions with Ras during spermatogenesis and retinal differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster,11509670,10.1128/mcb.21.18.6280-6291.2001,"Our analysis of rotund (rn) null mutations in Drosophila melanogaster revealed that deletion of the rn locus affects both spermatid and retinal differentiation. In the male reproductive system, the absence of RnRacGAP induced small testes, empty seminal vesicles, short testicular cysts, reduced amounts of interspermatid membrane, the absence of individualization complexes, and incomplete mitochondrial condensation. Flagellar growth continued within the short rn null cysts to produce large bulbous terminations of intertwined mature flagella. Organization of the retina was also severely perturbed as evidenced by grossly misshapen ommatidia containing reduced numbers of photoreceptor and pigment cells. These morphological phenotypes were rescued by genomic rnRacGAP transgenes, demonstrating that RnRacGAP function is critical to spermatid and retinal differentiation. The testicular phenotypes were suppressed by heterozygous hypomorphic mutations in the Dras1 and drk genes, indicating cross talk between RacGAP-regulated signaling and that of the Ras pathway. The observed genetic interactions are consistent with a model in which Rac signaling is activated by Ras and negatively regulated by RnRacGAP during spermatid differentiation. RnRacGAP and Ras cross talk also operated during retinal differentiation; however, while the heterozygous hypomorphic drk mutation continued to act as a suppressor of the rn null mutation, the heterozygous hypomorphic Dras1 mutation induced novel retinal phenotypes.",2001,"E Bergeret, I Pignot-Paintrand, A Guichard, K Raymond, M O Fauvarque, M Cazemajor, R Griffin-Shea, E Bergeret, I Pignot-Paintrand, A Guichard, K Raymond, M O Fauvarque, M Cazemajor, R Griffin-Shea"
Comparative analysis of the nonA region in Drosophila identifies a highly diverged 5' gene that may constrain nonA promoter evolution,11156994,,"A genomic fragment from Drosophila virilis that contained all the no-on-transientA (nonA) coding information, plus several kilobases of upstream material, was identified.

In both species, another gene that lies <350 bp upstream from the nonA transcription starts, and that probably corresponds to the lethal gene l(1)i19, was identified. This gene encodes a protein that shows similarities to GPI1, which is required for the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), a component for anchoring eukaryotic proteins to membranes, and so we have named it dGpi1. The molecular evolution of nonA and dGpi1 sequences show remarkable differences, with the latter revealing a level of amino acid divergence that is as high as that of transformer and with extremely low levels of codon bias. Nevertheless, in D. melanogaster hosts, the D. virilis fragment rescues the lethality associated with a mutation of l(1)i19e, as well as the viability and visual defects produced by deletion of nonA(-).

When expressed in wing imaginal disks, hSmad2 induced oversize wings while hSmad3 induced cell death. This observation suggests that a very small number of amino acid differences, between Smads in the same species, confer distinct developmental roles. Our observations also suggest new roles for the dSmads, Med and Dad, in dActivin signaling and potential interactions between these family members. Overall, the study demonstrates that transgenic methods in Drosophila can provide new information about non-Drosophila members of developmentally important multigene families.",2001,"R M Marquez, M A Singer, N T Takaesu, W R Waldrip, Y Kraytsberg, S J Newfeld, R M Marquez, M A Singer, N T Takaesu, W R Waldrip, Y Kraytsberg, S J Newfeld"
The effects of selection for larval behavior on adult life-history features in Drosophila melanogaster,11831665,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2001.tb00764.x,"Selection for late-life fecundity and longevity in adult Drosophila melanogaster is well known to modify numerous characteristics of life history and physiology. We report experiments here in which selection applied to behavior affects features in an identical fashion. Selection for feeding rate of larval D. melanogaster modifies caloric intake, as measured by the uptake and incorporation of labeled glucose. Selection for slow larval feeding produced lines of D. melanogaster in which larvae synthesized significantly less lipid prior to pupation and eclosed to have low early-life fecundity and a long life as adults. They also had greater lifetime fecundity, but lower viability of egg to hatched adult. Alternatively, fast-feeding larvae incorporated more lipid before pupation and eclosed with high early-fecundity that declined rapidly throughout their short adult life. Slow-feeding populations also had a significantly enhanced expression of the stress-resistance genes CuZn-SOD, CATALASE, and HSP70. Selection on larval feeding behavior reproduced the antagonistic evolutionary trade-off found under selection for adult life span and mimicked the physiological response in life span as seen in many species when dietary restriction is imposed on adults. Thus, nutrient acquisition during development appears to share a common evolutionary and genetic basis with the allocation processes that determine adult life-history traits and the related phenotypic dietary restriction phenomena.",2001,"P A Foley, L S Luckinbill, P A Foley, L S Luckinbill"
Giant neuron pathway neurophysiological activity in per(0) mutants of Drosophila melanogaster,12092905,10.3109/01677060109167378,"In Drosophila melanogaster, the clock gene period (per) has a clearly defined role in the molecular machinery involved in generating free-running circadian rhythms. per mutations also influence rhythms in the Drosophila love song and in the ultradian timescale. The relationship between these two phenomena has so far escaped satisfactory explanation. Here we analyzed the neurophysiological activity of the giant fiber neural pathway in per(0) flies. Under constant light, and at relatively low stimulation frequencies (1-2 Hz), per(01) flies habituate significantly earlier than they do under 12 h light-dark cycles.

The Rac GTPase-activating protein RotundRacGAP interferes with Drac1 and Dcdc42 signalling in Drosophila melanogaster,11468292,10.1074/jbc.M105779200,"RhoGTPases are negatively regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Here we demonstrate that Drosophila RotundRacGAP is active in vitro on Drac1 and Dcdc42 but not Drho1. Similarly, in yeast, RotundRacGAP interacts specifically with Drac1 and Dcdc42, as well as with their activated V12 forms, showing a particularly strong interaction with Dcdc42V12. In the fly, lowering RotundRacGAP dosage specifically modifies eye defects induced by expressing Drac1 or Dcdc42 but not Drho1, confirming that Drac1 and Dcdc42 are indeed in vivo targets of RotundRacGAP. Furthermore, embryonic-directed expression of either RotundRacGAP, or dominant negative Drac1N17, transgenes induces similar defects in dorsal closure and inhibits Drac1-dependent cytoskeleton assembly at the leading edge. Expression of truncated forms of RotundRacGAP shows that the GAP domain of RotundRacGAP is essential for its function. Unexpectedly, transgenes encoding Drac1N17, Dcdc42N17, or RotundRacGAP do not affect the c-Jun N-terminal kinase-dependent gene expression of decapentaplegic and puckered, indicating that another Drac1-independent signal redundantly activates this pathway. Finally, in a situation where Drac1 is constitutively activated, RotundRacGAP greatly reduces the ectopic expression of decapentaplegic, possibly by negatively regulating Dcdc42.",2001,"K Raymond, E Bergeret, M C Dagher, R Breton, R Griffin-Shea, M O Fauvarque, K Raymond, E Bergeret, M C Dagher, R Breton, R Griffin-Shea, M O Fauvarque"

It was shown with the use of mutant Drosophila melanogaster laboratory strains, that the disfunction of a reaper-dependent apoptosis pathway, together with the action of ionizing radiation and/or apoptosis inductor etoposide, could lead to change of life span and a pace of aging. In Drosophila strain with defect of proapoptosis gene reaper, the increase of life span after irradiation and etoposide treatment was observed. At the same time the strain with overexpression of a protease dcp-1 gene and the strain with the defect of antiapoptosis diap-1/th gene decreased the life span after irradiation and etoposide treatment.

Here we report that males from third-chromosome isogenic lines demonstrated significant genetic variation in male reproductive performance and in the longevity of their mates. Increased male performance was marginally significantly associated with one measure of increased female survival rate. However, there was no indication of tradeoffs or negative correlations between male reproductive success and female survival.

Butyrate induced alterations during development of the strain ln(1)BM2(reinverted) of Drosophila melanogaster,11495283,,"The polytene male X chromosome of D. melanogaster, has a unique morphology, which is correlated with the property of increased transcription of the sex-linked genes of the male X chromosome. This ensures equalization of X-linked gene products between males (XY) and females (XX). Till date, an invariable correlation between the structure and transcription of the male X chromosome has been reported. However, the strain In(1)BM2(reinverted) of D. melanogaster presents a caveat to this invariable correlation. In this strain, although the male X chromosome appears puffy and diffuse, the transcription remains at the wild type level. This observation suggests the perturbation in the function of a regulator that controls the structure of the male X chromosome. In this report the response of the strain to butyrate, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, has been studied, with specific reference to development, sex ratio and chromosome morphology of the strain. Two important conclusions arise from these experiments : (a) exposure to butyrate has more severe consequences on the development of the mutant strain and on the survival of females. (b) rearing on butyrate induced a temporal series of structural alteration of the polytene chromosome of the wild type, with the male X chromosome being most vulnerable to structural changes. The butyrate-interaction of In(1)BM2(reinverted) together with our current biochemical analyses of a chromosome coiling protein recovered from this strain, provide data for a working hypothesis explaining the sex and chromosome specific alteration of the structure of the male X chromosome of In(1)BM2(reinverted).",2001,"I Dey-Guha, A Kar, I Dey-Guha, A Kar"

When the links between nonhomologs are involved, interchromosomal effects on chromosome disjunction and nonhomologous pairing were revealed by the genetic methods.

[Stability in development and variability in morphological signs in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster: seasonal dynamics in 1999],11234427,,Seasonal dynamics of developmental stability and variability of morphological traits was examined in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster in order to compare these two parameters as indicators of temperature stress. Morphometric (thorax length and wing length) and meristic (number of sternopelural and orbital bristles) were studied. Variability was measured as the coefficient of variation. Stability of development was estimated as fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of bilateral traits. Thorax length and wing length did not exhibit consistent seasonal trends whereas wing loading significantly decreased. Significant seasonal changes in FA were not detected in any trait examined. Two traits showed reduced variation in autumn. The use of FA as an indicator of ecological stresses in insects is discussed on the basis of these results and the literature evidence.,2001,"M I Antipin, T A Rakitskaia, A G Imasheva, M I Antipin, T A Rakitskaia, A G Imasheva"
Immune response of Drosophila melanogaster to infection with the flagellate parasite Crithidia spp,11164335,10.1016/s0965-1748(00)00096-5,"Insects are able to recognize invading microorganisms and to mount an immune response to bacterial and fungal infections. Recently, the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a promising invertebrate model to investigate innate immunity because of its well-characterized genetics. Insects are also vectors of numerous parasites which can trigger an immune response. We have investigated the interaction of Drosophila melanogaster with the flagellate protozoan Crithidia spp. We show that a per os parasitic infection triggers the synthesis of several antimicrobial peptides. By reverse phase HPLC and mass spectrometry, peptides were shown to be present in the hemolymph and not in the gut tissue, suggesting the presence of immune messengers between the site of the infection, namely the gut, and the fat body, the main site of synthesis for antimicrobial peptides. Interestingly, we have identified one molecule which is specifically induced in the hemolymph after infection with Crithidia, but not with bacteria, suggesting that Drosophila can discriminate between pathogens. When flagellates were injected into the hemolymph, a low synthesis of antimicrobial peptides was observed together with phagocytosis of parasites by circulating hemocytes. The data presented here suggest that Drosophila-Crithidia spp. represents an interesting model to study host defense against protozoan parasites.",2001,"N Boulanger, L Ehret-Sabatier, R Brun, D Zachary, P Bulet, J L Imler, N Boulanger, L Ehret-Sabatier, R Brun, D Zachary, P Bulet, J L Imler"

Here we found that stomach acid secretion in adults was insensitive to labk3. The basis for this stage-specific effect was elucidated by characterizing the development, structure, and function of the adult midgut. First, we demonstrated by copper-dependent fluorescence and morphology that copper cells were present in the adult stomach. Fine-structure analysis of adult copper cells led to the identification of a previously unrecognized plasma membrane domain: apicolateral contacts between copper cells and their neighbors consisted of smooth septate junctions that were enriched in alphabeta-spectrin and ankyrin. Second, we demonstrated that adult copper cells were present in labk3/labvd1 (conditional/null) adults. The labial protein was expressed in adult labk3/labvd1 copper cells, but not in larvae. Thus the labk3 mutation had a stage-specific effect on midgut labial expression, but did not appear to affect protein function. Surprisingly, stomach acidification was dispensable during larval development, since labk3/labvd1 mutant larvae that lacked midgut acidification developed into fertile adults.",2001,"R R Dubreuil, T Grushko, O Baumann, R R Dubreuil, T Grushko, O Baumann"
Haemocyte changes in resistant and susceptible strains of D. melanogaster caused by virulent and avirulent strains of the parasitic wasp Leptopilina boulardi,11064023,10.1016/s0022-1910(00)00102-5,"Two strains of Drosophila melanogaster (resistant and susceptible) were parasitized by a virulent or avirulent strain of the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi. The success of encapsulation depends on both the genetic status of the host strain and the genetic status of the parasitoid strain: the immune cellular reaction (capsule) is observed only with the resistant strain-avirulent strain combination. The total numbers of host haemocytes increased in all 4 combinations, suggesting that an immune reaction was triggered in all hosts. Resistant host larvae infected with the virulent or avirulent strains of parasitoid wasp had slightly more haemocytes per mm(3) than did susceptible host larvae at the beginning of the reaction (less than 15 h post-parasitization). This difference disappeared later. Only the virulent parasitoid strain caused the production of a high percentage of altered lamellocytes (from a discoid shape to a bipolar shape), half the total number of lamellocytes are altered. This suggests that the alteration of lamellocyte shape alone is not sufficient to explain the lack of capsule formation seen in resistant hosts parasitized by the virulent strain. Lastly, there were very few altered lamellocytes in resistant or susceptible hosts parasitized by the avirulent parasitoid strain, two combinations in which no capsule was formed. As is now established for Drosophila-parasitoid interactions, virus-like particles contained in the long gland of the female wasp affect the morphology of the lamellocytes. The results presented here are further proof of the action (direct or indirect) of virus like particles of the virulent strain on lamellocytes.",2001,"J Russo, M BrehÃ©lin, Y Carton, J Russo, M BrehÃ©lin, Y Carton"
The overall conformation of conventional kinesins studied by small angle X-ray and neutron scattering,11020387,10.1074/jbc.M007169200,The quaternary structures of several monomeric and dimeric kinesin constructs from Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster were analyzed using small angle x-ray and neutron scattering. The experimental scattering curves of these proteins were compared with simulated scattering curves calculated from available crystallographic coordinates. These comparisons indicate that the overall conformations of the solution structures of D. melanogaster and H. sapiens kinesin heavy chain dimers are compatible with the crystal structure of dimeric kinesin from Rattus norvegicus. This suggests that the unusual asymmetric conformation of dimeric kinesin in the microtubule-independent ADP state is likely to be a general feature of the kinesin heavy chain subfamily.

The Drosophila melanogaster homologue of an insect calcitonin-like diuretic peptide stimulates V-ATPase activity in fruit fly Malpighian tubules,11316500,,"The Drosophila melanogaster homologue of an insect calcitonin-like diuretic hormone was identified in a BLAST search of the Drosophila genome database. The predicted 31-residue amidated peptide (D. melanogaster DH31; Drome-DH31) was synthesised and tested for activity on fruit fly Malpighian tubules. It increases tubule secretion by approximately 35 % of the response obtained with a myokinin from the housefly Musca domestica (muscakinin; Musdo-K) and has an EC50 of 4.3 nmol x l(-1). The diuretic activities of Drome-DH31 and Musdo-K were additive when tested at threshold and supra-maximal concentrations, which suggests that they target different transport processes. In support of this, Drome-DH31 increased the rate of secretion by tubules held in bathing fluid with a reduced Cl- concentration, whereas Musdo-K did so only in the presence of Drome-DH31. Stimulation with Drome-DH31 increased the lumen-positive transepithelial potential in the main secretory segment of the tubule. This was attributed to activation of an apical electrogenic proton-translocating V-ATPase in principal cells, since it was associated with hyperpolarisation of the apical membrane potential and acidification of secreted urine by 0.25 pH units. Exogenous 8-bromo-cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP increased tubule secretion to the same extent as Drome-DH31 and, when tested together with the diuretic peptide, their activities were not additive. Stimulation with Drome-DH31 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in cyclic AMP production by tubules incubated in saline containing 0.5 mmol x l(-1) 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, whereas cyclic GMP production was unchanged. Taken together, the data are consistent with Drome-DH31 activating an apical membrane V-ATPase via cyclic AMP. Since the K+ concentration of the secreted urine was unchanged, it is likely that Drome-DH31 has an equal effect on K+ and Na+ entry across the basolateral membrane.",2001,"G M Coast, S G Webster, K M Schegg, S S Tobe, D A Schooley, G M Coast, S G Webster, K M Schegg, S S Tobe, D A Schooley"
Males' evolutionary responses to experimental removal of sexual selection,11375092,10.1098/rspb.2001.1621,"We evaluated the influence of pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection upon male reproductive traits in a naturally promiscuous species, Drosophila melanogaster. Sexual selection was removed in two replicate populations through enforced monogamous mating with random mate assignment or retained in polyandrous controls. Monogamous mating eliminates all opportunities for mate competition, mate discrimination, sperm competition, cryptic female choice and, hence, sexual conflict. Levels of divergence between lines in sperm production and male fitness traits were quantified after 38-81 generations of selection. Three a priori predictions were tested: (i) male investment in spermatogenesis will be lower in monogamy-line males due to the absence of sperm competition selection, (ii) due to the evolution of increased male benevolence, the fitness of females paired with monogamy-line males will be higher than that of females paired with control-line males, and (iii) monogamy-line males will exhibit decreased competitive reproductive success relative to control-line males. The first two predictions were supported, whereas the third prediction was not. Monogamy males evolved a smaller body size and the size of their testes and the number of sperm within the testes were disproportionately further reduced. In contrast, the fitness of monogamous males (and their mates) was greater when reproducing in a non-competitive context: females mated once with monogamous males produced offspring at a faster rate and produced a greater total number of surviving progeny than did females mated to control males. The results indicate that sexual selection favours the production of increased numbers of sperm in D. melanogaster and that sexual selection favours some male traits conferring a direct cost to the fecundity of females.",2001,"S Pitnick, G T Miller, J Reagan, B Holland, S Pitnick, G T Miller, J Reagan, B Holland"

Molecular characterization and developmental expression of the TFIIH factor p62 gene from Drosophila melanogaster: effects on the UV light sensitivity of a p62 mutant fly,12509240,10.1016/s1568-7864(02)00012-5,"TFIIH is a multiprotein complex that has a central role in the RNA pol II mediated transcription, in DNA repair and in the control of the cell cycle. Mutations in some components of TFIIH are associated with three hereditary human syndromes: xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS) and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). The p62 protein is a structural component of the TFIIH core and no syndromes have been identified up to date by mutations in this human gene. In this work we report the molecular and genetic characterization of the Drosophila melanogaster p62 gene (Dmp62). The Dmp62 gene product shows high identity with its human and mouse homologues. Using computer analysis we identified several common motifs in the p62 proteins from different organisms, suggesting that these motifs could be involved in possible protein-protein interactions within the TFIIH complex or with other transcription and DNA repair factors. The Dmp62 transcript is expressed at similar levels throughout development, although there is a significant increase of the transcript level during the late embryogenesis and in the adult male. The analysis of a Drosophila line with a P-element enhancer trap insertion at the Dmp62 5'-UTR that directs the lac-Z expression from the Dmp62 promoter, showed a high level of expression in the gut, the testis and the pericardial cells. A P-element that disrupts the Dmp62 gene (Dmp62mut) produces early embryo lethality in homozygous flies. Heterozygous Dmp62mut larvae are more sensitive to UV light irradiation, and those individuals that are able to develop into adults have severe abdominal cuticular damage after UV light irradiation.",2002,"Juan Castro, Carlos Merino, Mario Zurita, Juan Castro, Carlos Merino, Mario Zurita"
Human and Drosophila UDP-galactose transporters transport UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine in addition to UDP-galactose,11784306,10.1046/j.0014-2956.2001.02632.x,"A putative Drosophila nucleotide sugar transporter was characterized and shown to be the Drosophila homologue of the human UDP-Gal transporter (hUGT).

DmUGT and hUGT were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells in functionally active forms. Using microsomal vesicles isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing these transporters, we unexpectedly found that both hUGT and DmUGT could transport UDP-GalNAc as well as UDP-Gal. When amino-acid residues that are conserved among human, murine, fission yeast and Drosophila UGTs, but are distinct from corresponding ones conserved among CMP-Sia transporters (CSTs), were substituted by those found in CST, the mutant transporters were still active in transporting UDP-Gal. One of these mutants in which Asn47 was substituted by Ala showed aberrant intracellular distribution with concomitant destabilization of the protein product. However, this mutation was suppressed by an Ile51 to Thr second-site mutation.

Misato and Dml1p are descendants of an ancestral tubulin-like protein, and exhibit regions with similarity to members of a GTPase family that include eukaryotic tubulin and prokaryotic FtsZ. Deletion of DML1 was lethal to haploid cells; sporulated DML1/dml1Delta heterozygotes from different genetic backgrounds gave rise to no more than two viable spores per tetrad. DAPI staining for DNA in combination with Southern analysis using the mitochondrial genes COX3, 15S_rRNA_2, and COB revealed that a significant portion of the surviving meiotic progeny were [rho(0)] lacking mtDNA. In addition, meiotic transmission of centromeric plasmids also appeared to be impaired. Self-complementation using extra-chromosomal copies of DML1 efficiently restored meiotic inheritance of mtDNA, but improved spore viability ratios only in part. Inheritance of mtDNA could also be restored using misato cDNA. Unscheduled expression of DML1 tethered to the inducible ADH2 promoter altered both mitochondrial dispersion and general cell morphology. We propose that Dml1p and Misato have been co-opted into a role in mtDNA inheritance in yeast, and into a cell division-related mechanism in flies, respectively. Dml1p might additionally function in the partitioning of the mitochondrial organelle itself, or in the segregation of chromosomes, thereby explaining its essential requirement.",2002,"Aner Gurvitz, Andreas Hartig, Helmut Ruis, Barbara Hamilton, H Gert de Couet, Aner Gurvitz, Andreas Hartig, Helmut Ruis, Barbara Hamilton, H Gert de Couet"

Expression of Drosophila melanogaster xanthine dehydrogenase in Aspergillus nidulans and some properties of the recombinant enzyme,11829759,10.1042/0264-6021:3620223,"Recent crystal structures of xanthine dehydrogenase, xanthine oxidase and related enzymes have paved the way for a detailed structural and functional analysis of these enzymes. One problem encountered when working with these proteins, especially with recombinant protein, is that the preparations tend to be heterogeneous, with only a fraction of the enzyme molecules being active. This is due to the incompleteness of post-translational modification, which for this protein is a complex, and incompletely understood, process involving incorporation of the Mo and Fe/S centres. The enzyme has been expressed previously in both Drosophila and insect cells using baculovirus. The insect cell system has been exploited by Iwasaki et al.

The expression of Drosophila melanogaster xanthine dehydrogenase in Aspergillus nidulans is described. The purified protein has been analysed both functionally and spectroscopically. Its specific activity is indistinguishable from that of the enzyme purified from fruit flies [Doyle, Burke, Chovnick, Dutton, Whittle and Bray (1996) Eur. J. Biochem. 239, 782-795], and it appears to be more active than recombinant xanthine dehydrogenase produced with the baculovirus system. EPR spectra of the recombinant Drosophila enzyme are reported, including parameters for the Fe/S centres. Only a very weak ""Fe/SIII"" signal (g(1,2,3), 2.057, 1.930, 1.858) was observed, in contrast to the strong analogous signal reported for the enzyme from baculovirus. Since this signal appears to be associated with incomplete post-translational modification, this is consistent with relatively more complete cofactor incorporation in the Aspergillus-produced enzyme. Thus we have developed a recombinant expression system for D. melanogaster xanthine dehydrogenase, which can be used for the production of site-specific mutations of this enzyme.",2002,"Benjamin Adams, David J Lowe, Andrew T Smith, Claudio Scazzocchio, Stephane Demais, Robert C Bray, Benjamin Adams, David J Lowe, Andrew T Smith, Claudio Scazzocchio, Stephane Demais, Robert C Bray"
Rapid divergence of gene duplicates on the Drosophila melanogaster X chromosome,12032248,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004149,"The recent sequencing of several eukaryotic genomes has generated considerable interest in the study of gene duplication events. The classical model of duplicate gene evolution is that recurrent mutation ultimately results in one copy becoming a pseudogene, and only rarely will a beneficial new function evolve. Here, we study divergence between coding sequence duplications in Drosophila melanogaster as a function of the linkage relationship between paralogs. The mean K(a)/K(s) between all duplicates in the D. melanogaster genome is 0.2803, indicating that purifying selection is maintaining the structure of duplicate coding sequences. However, the mean K(a)/K(s) between duplicates that are both on the X chromosome is 0.4701, significantly higher than the genome average. Further, the distribution of K(a)/K(s) for these X-linked duplicates is significantly shifted toward higher values when compared with the distributions for paralogs in other linkage relationships. Two models of molecular evolution provide qualitative explanations of these observations-relaxation of selective pressure on the duplicate copies and, more likely, positive selection on recessive adaptations. We also show that there is an excess of X-linked duplicates with low K(s), suggesting a larger proportion of relatively young duplicates on the D. melanogaster X chromosome relative to autosomes.",2002,"Kevin Thornton, Manyuan Long"
Oskar anchoring restricts pole plasm formation to the posterior of the Drosophila oocyte,12117819,,"Localization of the maternal determinant Oskar at the posterior pole of Drosophila melanogaster oocyte provides the positional information for pole plasm formation. Spatial control of Oskar expression is achieved through the tight coupling of mRNA localization to translational control, such that only posterior-localized oskar mRNA is translated, producing the two Oskar isoforms Long Osk and Short Osk. We present evidence that this coupling is not sufficient to restrict Oskar to the posterior pole of the oocyte. We show that Long Osk anchors both oskar mRNA and Short Osk, the isoform active in pole plasm assembly, at the posterior pole. In the absence of anchoring by Long Osk, Short Osk disperses into the bulk cytoplasm during late oogenesis, impairing pole cell formation in the embryo. In addition, the pool of untethered Short Osk causes anteroposterior patterning defects, owing to the dispersion of pole plasm and its abdomen-inducing activity throughout the oocyte. We show that the N-terminal extension of Long Osk is necessary but not sufficient for posterior anchoring, arguing for multiple docking elements in Oskar. This study reveals cortical anchoring of the posterior determinant Oskar as a crucial step in pole plasm assembly and restriction, required for proper development of Drosophila melanogaster.",2002,"Nathalie F Vanzo, Anne Ephrussi, Nathalie F Vanzo, Anne Ephrussi"
Identification in Drosophila melanogaster of the invertebrate G protein-coupled FMRFamide receptor,12438685,10.1073/pnas.252339599,"We here describe the cloning and characterization of the functionally active Drosophila melanogaster (Drm) FMRFamide receptor, which we designated as DrmFMRFa-R. The full-length ORF of a D. melanogaster orphan receptor, CG 2114 (Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project), was cloned from genomic DNA. This receptor is distantly related to mammalian thyroid-stimulating hormone-releasing hormone receptors and to a set of Caenorhabditis elegans orphan receptors. An extract of 5,000 central nervous systems from the related but bigger flesh fly, Neobellieria bullata (Neb), was used to screen cells expressing the orphan receptor. Successive purification steps, followed by MS, revealed the sequence of two previously uncharacterized endogenous peptides, APPQPSDNFIRFamide (Neb-FIRFamide) and pQPSQDFMRFamide (Neb-FMRFamide). These are reminiscent of other insect FMRFamide peptides, having neurohormonal as well as neurotransmitter functions. Nanomolar concentrations of the Drm FMRFamides (DPKQDFMRFamide, TPAEDFMRFamide, SDNFMRFamide, SPKQDFMRFamide, and PDNFMRFamide) activated the cognate receptor in a dose-dependent manner.

The Hox gene abdominal-A specifies heart cell fate in the Drosophila dorsal vessel,12397110,,"The Drosophila melanogaster dorsal vessel is a linear organ that pumps blood through the body. Blood enters the dorsal vessel in a posterior chamber termed the heart, and is pumped in an anterior direction through a region of the dorsal vessel termed the aorta. Although the genes that specify dorsal vessel cell fate are well understood, there is still much to be learned concerning how cell fate in this linear tube is determined in an anteroposterior manner, either in Drosophila or in any other animal. We demonstrate that the formation of a morphologically and molecularly distinct heart depends crucially upon the homeotic segmentation gene abdominal-A (abd-A). abd-A expression in the dorsal vessel was detected only in the heart, and overexpression of abd-A induced heart fate in the aorta in a cell-autonomous manner. Mutation of abd-A resulted in a loss of heart-specific markers. We also demonstrate that abd-A and sevenup co-expression in cardial cells defined the location of ostia, or inflow tracts. Other genes of the Bithorax Complex do not appear to participate in heart specification, although high level expression of Ultrabithorax is capable of inducing a partial heart fate in the aorta. These findings for the first time demonstrate a specific involvement for Hox genes in patterning the muscular circulatory system, and suggest a mechanism of broad relevance for animal heart patterning.",2002,"TyAnna L Lovato, Thiennga P Nguyen, Marco R Molina, Richard M Cripps, TyAnna L Lovato, Thiennga P Nguyen, Marco R Molina, Richard M Cripps"
On the abundance and distribution of transposable elements in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster,12032249,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004150,"The abundance and distribution of transposable elements (TEs) in a representative part of the euchromatic genome of Drosophila melanogaster were studied by analyzing the sizes and locations of TEs of all known families in the genomic sequences of chromosomes 2R, X, and 4. TEs contribute to up to 2% of the sequenced DNA, which corresponds roughly to the euchromatin of these chromosomes. This estimate is lower than that previously available from in situ data and suggests that TEs accumulate in the heterochromatin more intensively than was previously thought. We have also found that TEs are not distributed at random in the chromosomes and that their abundance is more strongly associated with local recombination rates, rather than with gene density. The results are compatible with the ectopic exchange model, which proposes that selection against deleterious effects of chromosomal rearrangements is a major force opposing element spread in the genome of this species. Selection against insertional mutations also influences the observed patterns, such as an absence of insertions in coding regions. The results of the analyses are discussed in the light of recent findings on the distribution of TEs in other species.",2002,"Carolina BartolomÃ©, Xulio Maside, Brian Charlesworth, Carolina BartolomÃ©, Xulio Maside, Brian Charlesworth"
Aging: the fitness-stress continuum and genetic variability,12227918,10.1080/03610730290080380,"Assuming the stress theory of aging, longevity depends upon primary selection for stress resistance and metabolic efficiency. Predominantly based upon experimental studies in the insect Drosophila melanogaster, high genetic variability for fitness, especially mortality, occurs under extreme stress. Isofemale strains derived from the progeny of recently collected single inseminated Drosophila females from the wild should provide useful biological material for extrapolating to quantitative genetic studies in man. Furthermore, environments from the benign (hormetic) to the extreme can be incorporated. Survival to old age may depend upon genes for metabolic efficiency that respond to the environmental challenges of living as limits to adaptation are approached. Under this scenario the survival of longevity mutants in man to ages analogous to the extreme life spans found in some experimental organisms under benign or protected laboratory conditions is unlikely. More future emphasis is needed on genetic variation of longevity in natural populations of experimental organisms under an array of realistically stressful environments to act as an evolutionary model for longevity in our own species.",2002,"Peter A Parsons, Peter A Parsons"

"Identification and characterization of a Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of human beta1,4-galactosyltransferase VII",12244071,10.1093/glycob/cwf074,"Drosophila melanogaster is widely considered to be an attractive model organism for studying the functions of the carbohydrate moieties of glycoconjugates produced by higher eukaryotes. However, the pathways of glycoconjugate biosynthesis are not as well defined in insects as they are in higher eukaryotes. One way to address this problem is to identify genes in the Drosophila genome that might encode relevant functions, express them, and determine the functions of the gene products by direct biochemical assays. In this study, we used this approach to identify a putative Drosophila beta4-galactosyltransferase gene and determine the enzymatic activity of its product. Biochemical assays demonstrated that this gene product could transfer galactose from UDP-galactose to a beta-xylosyl acceptor, but not to other acceptors in vitro. The apparent K(m) values for the donor and acceptor substrates indicated that this gene product is a functional galactosyltransferase. Additional assays showed that the enzyme is activated by manganese, has a slightly acidic pH optimum, and is localized in the insect cell Golgi apparatus. These results showed that Drosophila encodes an ortholog of human beta4-galactosyltransferase-VII, also known as galactosyltransferase I, which participates in proteoglycan biosynthesis by transferring the first galactose to xylose in the linkage tetrasaccharide of glycosaminoglycan side chains.",2002,"Nadia Vadaie, Rebecca S Hulinsky, Donald L Jarvis, Nadia Vadaie, Rebecca S Hulinsky, Donald L Jarvis"

A Vestigial:Scalloped TEA domain chimera rescues the wing phenotype of a scalloped mutation in Drosophila melanogaster,12001068,10.1002/gene.10086,"The development of the Drosophila wing requires both scalloped and vestigial functions. Using a fusion between full-length Vestigial and the Scalloped TEA domain, the fusion protein can rescue scalloped wing mutations because within wing development, Scalloped and Vestigial cooperatively act as a transcription complex. Scalloped provides the necessary DNA binding function via the TEA domain and Vestigial promotes the activation of target genes. We also demonstrate that the putative nuclear localization signal contained in the TEA domain of Scalloped is likely responsible for the nuclear localization of Vestigial. The fusion protein is also capable of activating a known target gene of the native complex and thus represents a tool that will be helpful in rapidly identifying target genes of the Sd/Vg complex that are involved in wing differentiation. The functionality of the fusion suggests that only the TEA domain of Scalloped is critical for wing development and the rest of the protein (about 70%) is dispensable. This result is novel and should stimulate further studies of sd in other tissues in view of the fact that scalloped is a vital gene in Drosophila.",2002,"Ajay Srivastava, Julie O MacKay, John B Bell, Ajay Srivastava, Julie O MacKay, John B Bell"
Control of oxidative stress resistance by IP3 kinase in Drosophila melanogaster,12398933,10.1016/s0891-5849(02)01019-5,"Oxidative damage is thought to be a major causal factor of aging, and is implicated in several human pathologies such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Nevertheless the genetical determinants of in vivo oxidative stress response are still poorly understood. To identify cellular components whose deregulation leads to oxidative stress resistance, we performed a genetic screen in Drosophila melanogaster. We thus identified in this screen Drosophila Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate kinase I (D-IP3K1), a Drosophila gene homologous to mammalian IP3Ks. In vertebrates, IP3Ks phosphorylate the second messenger Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) to produce Inositol 1,3,4,5 tetrakiphosphate (IP4). IP3 binding to its receptor (IP3R) triggers Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol, whereas IP4 physiological role remains elusive. We show here that ubiquitous overexpression of D-IP3K1 confers resistance of flies to H(2)O(2)- but not to paraquat-induced oxidative stress. Additional genetic analysis with other members of IP3 and IP4 signaling pathways led us to propose that the D-IP3K1 protective effect is mainly mediated through the reduction of IP3 level (which probably results in reduced Ca(2+) release from internal stores), rather than through the rise of IP4 level.",2002,"VÃ©ronique Monnier, Fabrice Girardot, Wilfried Audin, HervÃ© Tricoire, VÃ©ronique Monnier, Fabrice Girardot, Wilfried Audin, HervÃ© Tricoire"
Unexpected stability of mariner transgenes in Drosophila,11861559,,"A number of mariner transformation vectors based on the mauritiana subfamily of transposable elements were introduced into the genome of Drosophila melanogaster and examined for their ability to be mobilized by the mariner transposase. Simple insertion vectors were constructed from single mariner elements into which exogenous DNA ranging in size from 1.3 to 4.5 kb had been inserted; composite vectors were constructed with partial or complete duplications of mariner flanking the exogenous DNA. All of the simple insertion vectors showed levels of somatic and germline excision that were at least 100-fold lower than the baseline level of uninterrupted mariner elements. Although composite vectors with inverted duplications were unable to be mobilized at detectable frequencies, vectors with large direct duplications of mariner could be mobilized. A vector consisting of two virtually complete elements flanking exogenous DNA yielded a frequency of somatic eye-color mosaicism of approximately 10% and a frequency of germline excision of 0.04%. These values are far smaller than those observed for uninterrupted elements. The results imply that efficient mobilization of mariner in vivo requires the presence and proper spacing of sequences internal to the element as well as the inverted repeats.",2002,"Elena R Lozovsky, Dmitry Nurminsky, Ernst A Wimmer, Daniel L Hartl, Elena R Lozovsky, Dmitry Nurminsky, Ernst A Wimmer, Daniel L Hartl"

Deletions that span a total of 0.5 Mb were identified and molecularly mapped precisely. Using overlapping deletions, the mutant phenotypes of nine previously uncharacterized genes in a 101-kb region were determined, including identification of new loci required for viability and female fertility.

This target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) process is mediated by endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities encoded by the element. We have designed a molecularly tagged, endonuclease-defective I element that can be mobilised with high efficiency by constructs that express the product of the I factor ORF2 in trans. This indicates that the endonuclease activity required for retrotransposition of the I factor can be provided in trans.

Wing area, however, does show increased phenotypic variance under both types of environmental stress. This increase is no greater in inbred than in outbred lines, showing that inbreeding does not increase the developmental effects of stress. Conversely, environmental stress does not increase the extent of inbreeding depression. Genetic variance is not correlated with environmental stress, although the amount of genetic variation varies significantly among environments and lines vary significantly in their response to environmental change. Drastic changes in the environment can cause changes in phenotypic and genetic variance, but not in a way reliably predicted by the notion of 'stress'.",2002,"Kevin Fowler, Michael C Whitlock, Kevin Fowler, Michael C Whitlock"
Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms in a period null Drosophila mutant (per01) by mammalian period homologues mPer1 and mPer2,11895480,10.1046/j.1356-9597.2001.00503.x,"Background:
      
    

    
      Recent molecular studies suggest that mammals and Drosophila utilize similar components to generate circadian (approximately equal to 24 h) rhythms. The first identified circadian clock gene, the period (per) gene, is indispensable for behavioural rhythms in Drosophila and is represented in mammals by three orthologues, the relative roles of which are not known. In this study, we investigated the functional conservation of per by introducing the mouse mPer1 and mPer2 genes, driven by the Drosophila timeless (tim) promoter, into Drosophila melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Behavioural assays showed that both mPer constructs restored rhythms in per(01) flies that are otherwise arrhythmic due to a lack of endogenous per protein (PER). However, the rhythms restored by mPer2 were generally stronger and differed in periodicity from those restored by mPer1. In rhythmic transgenic flies, mPER proteins were expressed in lateral neurones and/or many cells in optic lobe. In addition, cell culture experiments indicated that the Drosophila PER partner, TIM, can form a complex with each of these two mammalian proteins.

Demonstration of a novel gene DEXT3 of Drosophila melanogaster as the essential N-acetylglucosamine transferase in the heparan sulfate biosynthesis: chain initiation and elongation,11832488,10.1074/jbc.M111630200,"Hereditary multiple exostoses gene (EXT) family members encode glycosyltransferases required for heparan sulfate (HS) biosynthesis in humans as well as in Drosophila. In the present study, we identified a novel Drosophila EXT protein with a type II transmembrane topology and demonstrated its glycosyltransferase activities.

The results suggest that DEXT3 is the ortholog of human EXTL3 and Caenorhabditis elegans rib-2. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of the DEXT3 mRNA. Based on the findings of the present study and those of a recent study where a fly mutant, deficient in the botv gene identical to DEXT3, affected HS proteoglycan-mediated developmental signalings, it is suggested that DEXT3 with the revealed glycosyltransferase activities is critically involved in HS formation in Drosophila.

Regulation of P-element transposase activity in Drosophila melanogaster by hobo transgenes that contain KP elements,12019235,,"Fusions between the Drosophila hsp70 promoter and three different incomplete P elements, KP, SP, and BP1, were inserted into the Drosophila genome by means of hobo transformation vectors and the resulting transgenic stocks were tested for repression of P-element transposase activity. Only the H(hsp/KP) transgenes repressed transposase activity, and the degree of repression was comparable to that of a naturally occurring KP element. The KP transgenes repressed transposase activity both with and without heat-shock treatments. Both the KP element and H(hsp/KP) transgenes repressed the transposase activity encoded by the modified P element in the P(ry(+), Delta2-3)99B transgene more effectively than that encoded by the complete P element in the H(hsp/CP)2 transgene even though the P(ry(+), Delta2-3)99B transgene was the stronger transposase source. Repression of both transposase sources appeared to be due to a zygotic effect of the KP element or transgene. There was no evidence for repression by a strictly maternal effect; nor was there any evidence for enhancement of KP repression by the joint maternal transmission of H(hsp/KP) and H(hsp/CP) transgenes. These results are consistent with the idea that KP-mediated repression of P-element activity involves a KP-repressor polypeptide that is not maternally transmitted and that KP-mediated repression is not strengthened by the 66-kD repressor produced by complete P elements through alternate splicing of their RNA.",2002,"Michael J Simmons, Kevin J Haley, Craig D Grimes, John D Raymond, Joseph C L Fong, Michael J Simmons, Kevin J Haley, Craig D Grimes, John D Raymond, Joseph C L Fong"
PP1 binds Sara and negatively regulates Dpp signaling in Drosophila melanogaster,12134149,10.1038/ng938,"In signaling involving the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of proteins, ligand binding brings the constitutively active type II receptor kinase into close proximity to its substrate, the type I receptor kinase, which it then activates by phosphorylation. The type I receptor kinase in turn phosphorylates one of the Smad family of transcription factors, which translocates to the nucleus and regulates gene expression. Smads are recruited to the receptor complex by an anchor protein, SARA (Smad anchor for receptor activation). Although several protein kinases in this pathway were known, including the receptors themselves, the relevant phosphatases had not previously been identified. Here we report the isolation of a Drosophila melanogaster homolog of SARA (Sara) in a screen for proteins that bind the catalytic subunit of type 1 serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP1c). We identified a PP1c-binding motif in Sara, disruption of which reduced the ability of Sara to bind PP1c. Expression of this non-PP1c-binding mutant resulted in hyperphosphorylation of the type I receptor and stimulated expression of a target of TGF-beta signaling. Reducing PP1c activity enhanced the increase in the basal level of expression of genes responsive to Dpp (Decapentaplegic) caused by ectopic expression of the type II receptor Punt. Together these data suggest that PP1c is targeted to Dpp receptor complexes by Sara, where it acts as a negative regulator of Dpp signaling by affecting the phosphorylation state of the type I receptor.",2002,"Daimark Bennett, Luke Alphey, Daimark Bennett, Luke Alphey"

Knockdown of A or C subunits individually or of combined B subunits led to concurrent loss of nontargeted PP2A subunits, suggesting that PP2A is an obligate heterotrimer in vivo. Global knockdown of PP2A activity or specific loss of redundant B56 regulatory subunits caused cell death with the morphological and biochemical changes characteristic of apoptosis in cultured S2 cells.

In Drosophila embryos, knockdown of B56-regulated PP2A activity resulted in apoptosis and failure of gastrulation, an effect that was blocked by concurrent RNAi of the caspase DRICE: B56-regulated PP2A activity appears to be required upstream of dp53 to maintain a critical proapoptotic substrate in a dephosphorylated, inactive state, thereby preventing apoptosis in Drosophila S2 cells.",2002,"Xinghai Li, Anne Scuderi, Anthea Letsou, David M Virshup, Xinghai Li, Anne Scuderi, Anthea Letsou, David M Virshup"
A few amino acid substitutions can convert deoxyribonucleoside kinase specificity from pyrimidines to purines,11927571,10.1093/emboj/21.7.1873,"In mammals, the four native deoxyribonucleosides are phosphorylated to the corresponding monophosphates by four deoxyribonucleoside kinases, which have specialized substrate specificities. These four enzymes are likely to originate from a common progenitor kinase. Insects appear to have only one multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase (dNK, EC 2.7.1.145), which prefers pyrimidine nucleosides, but can also phosphorylate purine substrates. When the structures of the human deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK, EC 2.7.1.113) and the dNK from Drosophila melanogaster were compared, a limited number of amino acid residues were identified and proposed to be responsible for the substrate specificity. Three of these key residues in Drosophila dNK were then mutagenized and the mutant enzymes were characterized regarding their ability to phosphorylate native deoxyribonucleosides and nucleoside analogs. The mutations converted the dNK substrate specificity from predominantly pyrimidine specific into purine specific. A similar scenario could have been followed during the evolution of kinases. Upon gene duplication of the progenitor kinase, only a limited number of single amino acid changes has taken place in each copy and resulted in substrate-specialized enzymes.",2002,"Wolfgang Knecht, Michael P B Sandrini, Kenth Johansson, Hans Eklund, Birgitte Munch-Petersen, Jure Piskur, Wolfgang Knecht, Michael P B Sandrini, Kenth Johansson, Hans Eklund, Birgitte Munch-Petersen, Jure Piskur"
The essential Drosophila melanogaster gene wds (will die slowly) codes for a WD-repeat protein with seven repeats,12471440,10.1007/s00438-002-0768-0,"We have isolated and characterized the will die slowly (wds) gene of Drosophila melanogaster, formerly known as l(1)zw8 or l(1)3Ad.

The RNA has been localized by in situ hybridization to imaginal discs, larval brain, to nurse cells in the ovary, and to spermatogonia and spermatocytes in the testis. The putative translation product contains seven WD-repeats and is, therefore, a new member of the family of WD-proteins.

[Use of immunogold labelling technique for immunoelectron microscope localization of proteins in Drosophila polytene chromosomes],14520879,,"Using gold labeled antibodies, we developed and tested an immunoelectron microscope (IEM) method for detection of protein localization in Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes. This method is based on procedures widely used for indirect immunofluorescent (IF) staining of salivary gland polytene chromosome squashes. The application of IEM was evaluated by using specific antibodies against proteins earlier localized in both decondensed (interbands and puffs) and compact (bands) regions of polytene chromosomes. In all the experiments, IEM and IF images for homologous chromosome regions were compared. When applied to regions of loose structures, IEM enabled us to localize, with high precision, signals in fine bands, interbands and puffs. There was a good correspondence between immunogold EM and IF data. However, there was no correspondence for dense bands: gold particles were distributed at their boundaries, while the entire bands showed bright fluorescence. This discrepancy probably resulted from a poor penetration of antibodies conjugated to gold particles in the tightly packaged structures. From the results obtained it may by concluded that the IEM method is advantageous for studying the fine protein topography of loose decompacted regions of polytene chromosomes. And this must be taken into consideration when protein localization in polytene chromosomes is performed.",2003,"V F Semeshin, V V Shloma, E N Andreeva, H Saumweber, I F Zhimulev, V F Semeshin, V V Shloma, E N Andreeva, H Saumweber, I F Zhimulev"
QTL mapping reveals a striking coincidence in the positions of genomic regions associated with adaptive variation in body size in parallel clines of Drosophila melanogaster on different continents,14686541,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb01509.x,"Latitudinal genetic clines in body size are common in many ectotherm species and are attributed to climatic adaptation. Here, we use Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping to identify genomic regions associated with adaptive variation in body size in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster from extreme ends of a cline in South America. Our results show that there is a significant association between the positions of QTL with strong effects on wing area in South America and those previously reported in a QTL mapping study of Australian cline end populations (P < 0.05). In both continents, the right arm of the third chromosome is associated with QTL with the strongest effect on wing area. We also show that QTL peaks for wing area and thorax length are associated with the same genomic regions, indicating that the clinal variation in the body size traits may have a similar genetic basis. The consistency of the results found for the South American and Australian cline end populations indicate that the genetic basis of the two clines may be similar and future efforts to identify the genes producing the response to selection should be focused on the genomic regions highlighted by the present work.",2003,"Federico C F Calboli, W Jason Kennington, Linda Partridge, Federico C F Calboli, W Jason Kennington, Linda Partridge"
Demography and natural selection have shaped genetic variation in Drosophila melanogaster: a multi-locus approach,14668381,,"Demography and selection have been recognized for their important roles in shaping patterns of nucleotide variability. To investigate the relative effects of these forces in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster, we used a multi-locus scan (105 fragments) of X-linked DNA sequence variation in a putatively ancestral African and a derived European population. Surprisingly, we found evidence for a recent size expansion in the African population, i.e., a significant excess of singletons at a chromosome-wide level. In the European population, such an excess was not detected. In contrast to the African population, we found evidence for positive natural selection in the European sample: (i) a large number of loci with low levels of variation and (ii) a significant excess of derived variants at the low-variation loci that are fixed in the European sample but rare in the African population. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the European population has experienced frequent selective sweeps in the recent past during its adaptation to new habitats.

Making the body plan: precision in the genetic hierarchy of Drosophila embryo segmentation,12762849,,"We quantify fluctuations in protein expression for three of the segmentation genes in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. These proteins are representative members of the first three levels of a signalling hierarchy which determines the segmented body plan: maternal (Bicoid protein); gap (Hunchback protein); and pair-rule (Even-skipped protein). We quantify both inter-embryo and inter-nucleus (within a single embryo) variability in expression, especially with respect to positional specification by concentration gradient reading. Errors are quantified both early and late in cleavage cycle 14, during which the protein patterns develop, to study the dynamics of error transmission. We find that Bicoid displays very large positional errors, while expression of the downstream genes, Hunchback and Even-skipped, displays far more precise positioning. This is evidence that the pattern formation of the downstream proteins is at least partially independent of maternal signal, i. e. evidence against simple concentration gradient reading. We also find that fractional errors in concentration increase during cleavage cycle 14.",2003,"Alexander V Spirov, David M Holloway, Alexander V Spirov, David M Holloway"
"Functional redundancy within roX1, a noncoding RNA involved in dosage compensation in Drosophila melanogaster",12871910,,"Drosophila melanogaster males dosage compensate by twofold upregulation of the expression of genes on their single X chromosome.

We used a deletion analysis to search for functional RNA domains within roX1, assaying RNA stability, targeting of the MSL proteins to the X, and rescue of male viability in a roX1(-) roX2(-) mutant background. We found that deletion of 10% segments of the RNA did not dramatically reduce function in most cases, suggesting extensive internal redundancy. The 3' 600 nt of roX1 were most sensitive to mutations, affecting proper localization and 3' processing of the RNA.

Comparative analysis of leg and antenna development in wild-type and homeotic Drosophila melanogaster,12768424,10.1007/s00427-003-0326-8,"The insect leg and antenna are thought to be homologous structures, evolved from a common ancestral appendage. The homeotic transformations of antenna to leg in Drosophila produced by mutation of the Hox gene Antennapedia are position-specific, such that every particular antenna structure is transformed into a specific leg counterpart. This has been taken to suggest that the developmental programmes of these two appendages are still similar. In particular, the mechanisms for the specification of a cell's position within the appendage would be identical, only their interpretation would be different and subject to homeotic gene control. Here we explore the degree of conservation between the developmental programmes of leg and antenna in Drosophila and other dipterans, in wild-type and homeotic conditions. Most of the appendage pattern-forming genes are active in both appendages, and their expression domains are partially conserved. However, the regulatory relationships and interactions between these genes are different, and in fact cells change their expression while undergoing homeotic transformation. Thus, the positional information, and the mechanisms which generate it, are not strictly conserved between leg and antenna; and homeotic genes alter the establishment of positional clues, not only their interpretation. The partial conservation of pattern-forming genes in both appendages ensures a predictable re-specification of positional clues, producing the observed positional specificity of homeotic transformations.",2003,"Mark Cummins, Jose I Pueyo, Steve A Greig, Juan Pablo Couso, Mark Cummins, Jose I Pueyo, Steve A Greig, Juan Pablo Couso"
Apoptosis-mediated cell death within the ovarian polar cell lineage of Drosophila melanogaster,12538526,10.1242/dev.00313,"Polar cells have been described as pairs of specific follicular cells present at each pole of Drosophila egg chambers. They are required at different stages of oogenesis for egg chamber formation and establishment of both the anteroposterior and planar polarities of the follicular epithelium. We show that definition of polar cell pairs is a progressive process since early stage egg chambers contain a cluster of several polar cell marker-expressing cells at each pole, while as of stage 5, they contain invariantly two pairs of such cells. Using cell lineage analysis, we demonstrate that these pre-polar cell clusters have a polyclonal origin and derive specifically from the polar cell lineage, rather than from that giving rise to follicular cells. In addition, selection of two polar cells from groups of pre-polar cells occurs via an apoptosis-dependent mechanism and is required for correct patterning of the anterior follicular epithelium of vitellogenic egg chambers.",2003,"Florence Besse, Anne-Marie Pret, Florence Besse, Anne-Marie Pret"
Selected contribution: long-lived Drosophila melanogaster lines exhibit normal metabolic rates,12949016,10.1152/japplphysiol.00448.2003,"The use of model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, provides a powerful method for studying mechanisms of aging. Here we report on a large set of recombinant inbred (RI) D. melanogaster lines that exhibit approximately a fivefold range of average adult longevities. Understanding the factors responsible for the differences in longevity, particularly the characteristics of the longest-lived lines, can provide fundamental insights into the mechanistic correlates of aging. In ectothermic organisms, longevity is often inversely correlated with metabolic rate, suggesting the a priori hypothesis that long-lived lines will have low resting metabolic rates. We conducted approximately 6000 measurements of CO2 production in individual male flies aged 5, 16, 29, and 47 days postemergence and simultaneously measured the weight of individual flies and life spans in populations of each line. Even though there was a wide range of longevities, there was no evidence of an inverse relationship between the variables. The increased longevity of long-lived lines is not mediated through reduction of metabolic activity. In Drosophila, it is possible to both maintain a normal metabolic rate and achieve long life. These results are evaluated in the context of 100 years of research on the relationship between metabolic rate and life span.",2003,"Wayne A van Voorhies, Aziz A Khazaeli, James W Curtsinger, Wayne A van Voorhies, Aziz A Khazaeli, James W Curtsinger"

Together with previously described sequence divergence this suggests substantial functional diversification. By peptide mass fingerprinting and in vitro gene expression we have also shown that two of the genes encode the isozymes EST9 (formerly ESTC) and EST23. EST9 is the major 'alpha staining' esterase in zymograms of gut tissues in feeding stages while orthologues of EST23 confer resistance to organophosphorus insecticides in other higher Diptera. The results for EST9 and EST23 concur with previous suggestions that the products of the alpha esterase cluster function in digestion and detoxification of xenobiotic esters. However, many of the other genes in the cluster show developmental or tissue-specific expression that seems inconsistent with such roles. Furthermore, there is generally poor correspondence between the mRNA expression patterns of the remaining eight genes and isozymes previously characterized by standard techniques of electrophoresis and staining, suggesting that the alpha cluster might only account for a small minority of the esterase isozyme profile.",2003,"P M Campbell, G C de Q  Robin, L N Court, S J Dorrian, R J Russell, J G Oakeshott, P M Campbell, G C de Q  Robin, L N Court, S J Dorrian, R J Russell, J G Oakeshott"
Dropping like flies: environmentally induced impairment and protection of locomotor performance in adult Drosophila melanogaster,14671709,10.1086/376922,"In Drosophila, heat shock (HS) during the pupal stage chronically hinders adult locomotor performance by disrupting wing development and cellular and/or tissue-level mechanisms that support walking and flight. Furthermore, heat pretreatment (PT) protects locomotor function against these disruptions. HS flies with abnormal wings were less able to alter trajectory in free fall relative to control, PT-only, and PT+HS wild-type flies. This deficit was less severe but still present in HS-only flies with wild-type wings. Transgenic increases in the copies of genes encoding the major inducible heat-shock protein of Drosophila melanogaster, Hsp70, also protected walking ability from disruption due to pupal HS. Walking velocity did not differ between excision (five natural hsp70 copies) and extra-copy (five natural and six transgenic hsp70 copies) flies in the control, PT, and PT+HS groups, nor did velocity vary among these thermal treatment groups. HS dramatically reduced walking velocity, however, but this effect occurred primarily in the excision flies.

Characterization of one of these mutants resulted in the identification of a dADAR gene that plays a role in the sensitivity to low levels of oxygen. We have also used microarrays to study all known Drosophila genes, the expression of which may be altered by hyoxia.

Entrainment of eclosion rhythm in Drosophila melanogaster populations reared for more than 700 generations in constant light environment,14680138,10.1081/cbi-120025247,"In this paper, we report the results of our extensive study on eclosion rhythm of four independent populations of Drosophila melanogaster that were reared in constant light (LL) environment of the laboratory for more than 700 generations. The eclosion rhythm of these flies was assayed under LL, constant darkness (DD) and three periodic light-dark (LD) cycles (T20, T24, and T28). The percentage of vials from each population that exhibited circadian rhythm of eclosion in DD and in LL (intensity of approximately 100 lux) was about 90% and 18%, respectively. The mean free-running period (tau) of eclosion rhythm in DD was 22.85 +/- 0.87 h (mean +/- SD). Eclosion rhythm of these flies entrained to all the three periodic LD cycles, and the phase relationship (psi) of the peak of eclosion with respect to ""lights-on"" of the LD cycle was significantly different in the three periodic light regimes (T20, T24, and T28). The results thus clearly demonstrate that these flies have preserved the ability to exhibit circadian rhythm of eclosion and the ability to entrain to a wide range of periodic LD cycles even after being in an aperiodic environment for several hundred generations.

[Genetic control of mitosis: features of origin of sister chromatid sets in anaphase in Drosophila melanogaster mutant line aar(V158)],14582390,,"The effect of mutation aarV158 on anaphase separation of chromatids was studied on fixed cells of neural ganglia of Drosophila melanogaster larvae. It was shown that mutation aarV158 causes three types of defective chromosome segregation manifested as (1) monopolar anaphase, (2) separation of chromatids to an abnormally short distance in anaphase, and (3) bridging and lagging of some chromatids or prolonged asynchronous separation of sister chromatid sets to the poles in anaphase. We believe that the former two types of defective segregation are caused by disturbed centrosome separation at the beginning of mitosis and the third type, by defects in chromatid separation during anaphase. During the two-year maintenance of the mutation in a heterozygous state, partial correction (adaptive modification) of the defects of type 1 and type 2 (but not type 3) occurred. The correction of type 1 and type 2 defects during adaptogenesis depended on the genotype: in heterozygotes and homozygotes, respectively type 1 and type 2 were preferentially corrected. The frequency of type 3 defects remained constant during the two-year period of maintenance of the mutation in a heterozygous state. However, in all variants of the experiment, their frequency decreased with increasing distance between the sister chromatid sets.

On the other hand, memory formation can be distinguished by the requirement for different catecholamines, dopamine for aversive and octopamine for appetitive conditioning.

The purpose of this study was to identify factors responsible for modulating transepithelial chloride conductance in isolated tubules. I have found that tyrosine and several of its metabolites cause an increase in chloride conductance. The most potent of these agonists is tyramine, which is active at low nanomolar concentrations; the pharmacology of this response matches that of the previously published cloned insect tyramine receptor. In addition, the tubule appears capable of synthesizing tyramine from applied tyrosine, as shown by direct measurement of tyrosine decarboxylase activity. Immunohistochemical staining of tubules with an antibody against tyramine indicates that the principal cells are the sites of tyramine production, whereas previous characterization of the regulation of chloride conductance suggests that tyramine acts on the stellate cells.

All three TE insertions are within the same 87-bp region of hsp70Ba promoter, and we suggest that the distinctive promoter architecture of hsp genes may make them vulnerable to TE insertions. Each of the TE insertions reduces Hsp70 levels, and RNase protection assays demonstrate that such insertions can reduce transcription of the hsp70Ba gene. In addition, the TEs alter two measures of organismal fitness, inducible thermotolerance and female reproductive success.

The Drosophila chk2 gene loki is essential for embryonic DNA double-strand-break checkpoints induced in S phase or G2,12663536,,"Cell cycle checkpoints are signal transduction pathways that control the order and timing of cell cycle transitions, ensuring that critical events are completed before the occurrence of the next cell cycle transition. The Chk2 family of kinases is known to play a central role in mediating the cellular responses to DNA damage or DNA replication blocks in various organisms. Here we show through a phylogenetic study that the Drosophila melanogaster serine/threonine kinase Loki is the homolog of the yeast Mek1p, Rad53p, Dun1p, and Cds1 proteins as well as the human Chk2. Functional analyses allowed us to conclude that, in flies, chk2 is involved in monitoring double-strand breaks (DSBs) caused by irradiation during S and G2 phases. In this process it plays an essential role in inducing a cell cycle arrest in embryonic cells. Our results also show that, in contrast to C. elegans chk2, Drosophila chk2 is not essential for normal meiosis and recombination, and it also appears to be dispensable for the MMS-induced DNA damage checkpoint and the HU-induced DNA replication checkpoint during larval development. In addition, Drosophila chk2 does not act at the same cell cycle phases as its yeast homologs, but seems rather to be involved in a pathway similar to the mammalian one, which involves signaling through the ATM/Chk2 pathway in response to genotoxic insults.

Telomeric position effect in drosophila melanogaster reflects a telomere length control mechanism,12723711,10.1023/a:1022925003172,"The terminal DNA arrays on chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster are composed of two families of non-LTR retrotransposons, HeT-A and TART. Available evidence suggests that chromosome length in this species and its close relatives is maintained by targeted transposition of these elements, with attachment of the elements to the chromosome end by their 3' oligo(A) tails. However, the regulation of transposition of these elements and the control of telomere length are poorly understood. Here we present the hypothesis that the forces involved in telomere length regulation in Drosophila are the underlying forces that manifest themselves as telomeric position effect (TPE). Based on recent studies of TPE, which found that expression of a reporter gene is influenced by telomere structure in cis and trans, we propose that the subtelomeric satellite (TAS) in D. melanogaster plays an important role in controlling telomere elongation. Transcription of a HeT-A element is probably initiated at a promoter in the 3' UTR of an upstream element, and TAS may repress this transcriptional activity in cis and trans. A region of HeT-A not at the extreme 3' end of the element may act as a transcriptional enhancer that may be modulated by TAS.",2003,"James M Mason, Alexander Y Konev, Harald Biessmann, James M Mason, Alexander Y Konev, Harald Biessmann"
Active suppression of D. melanogaster immune response by long gland products of the parasitic wasp Leptopilina boulardi,12770630,10.1016/s0022-1910(03)00054-4,"To develop inside their insect hosts, endoparasitoid wasps must either evade or overcome the host's immune system. Several ichneumonid and braconid wasps inject polydnaviruses that display well-studied immune suppressive effects. However, little is known about the strategies of immunoevasion used by other parasitoid families, such as figitid wasps. The present study provides experimental evidence, based on superparasitism and injection experiments, that the figitid species Leptopilina boulardi uses an active mechanism to suppress the Drosophila melanogaster host immune response, i.e. the encapsulation of the parasitoid eggs. The immune suppressive factors are localised in the long gland and reservoir of the female genital tractus, where virus-like particles (VLPs) have been observed. Parasitism experiments using a host tumorous strain indicate that these factors do not destroy host lamellocytes but that they impair the melanisation pathway. Interestingly, they are not susceptible to heating and are not depleted with prolonged oviposition experience, in contrast to observations reported for L. heterotoma, another figitid species. The mechanisms that prevent encapsulation of eggs from L. boulardi and L. heterotoma differ in several respects, suggesting that different physiological strategies of immunosuppression might be used by specialised and generalist parasitoids.",2003,"C Labrosse, Y Carton, A Dubuffet, J M Drezen, M Poirie, C Labrosse, Y Carton, A Dubuffet, J M Drezen, M Poirie"

After germinal exposure to the alkylating agent N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, we have obtained new phenotypes in the offspring, mainly lighter eye colour, but not revertants to the original phenotype. Subsequent genetic crosses showed that only 3 out of 13 new mutant phenotypes were allelic. Three white gene regions were analysed by Southern blot in order to determine the nature of the mutations. These three regions were the 5' regulatory region, the copia insertion site and the 3' coding region. The results obtained indicate that the treatment does not induce the total or partial excision of copia in the white locus. Two of the new allelic mutants present a 5' or 3' deletion in the white locus. The other new phenotypes seem to be caused by mutations being induced in other loci acting as modifiers, most of them located on the X chromosome.",2003,"E Baldrich, A VelÃ¡zquez, N Xamena, O CabrÃ©, E Baldrich, A VelÃ¡zquez, N Xamena, O CabrÃ©"
Interspecies comparison of a gene pair with partially redundant function: the rst and kirre genes in D. virilis and D. melanogaster,12574866,10.1007/s00239-002-2393-2,"The D. melanogaster rst and kirre genes encode two highly related immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecules that function redundantly during embryonic muscle development. The two genes appear to be derived from a common ancestor by gene duplication. Gene duplications have been proposed to be of major evolutionary significance since duplicated redundant sequences can accumulate mutations without detrimental effects for the organism and leave the duplicated genes free to assume novel functions. To address the issue of conservation of the duplicated sequences and their putative redundancy, as well as to identify putative functional divergence of the paralogs during drosophilid evolution, we performed an interspecies comparison of the rst and kirre genes from D. virilis and D. melanogaster. The D. virilis genome contains orthologues of both rst and kirre and hence the duplication took place before the split of the two lineages and has subsequently been conserved. However, whilst the Rst orthologues show a high degree of sequence similarity, this similarity is lower in Kirre orthologues. Especially the intracellular domains of D. virilis and D. melanogaster Kirre sequences are highly divergent: the D. virilis kirre gene lacks the 3'-most exon present in D. melanogaster, which contains motifs conserved between kirre and rst in D. melanogaster. Hence, while each of the two genes is highly conserved at the level of its exon-intron organization, the selection forces acting on the rst and kirre coding sequences are different. These findings are discussed in the light of general evolutionary mechanisms.",2003,"Martin StrÃ¼nkelnberg, H Gert de Couet, Alexander Hertenstein, Karl-Friedrich Fischbach, Martin StrÃ¼nkelnberg, H Gert de Couet, Alexander Hertenstein, Karl-Friedrich Fischbach"
Testing for asymmetrical gene flow in a Drosophila melanogaster body-size cline,14573478,,"Asymmetrical gene flow is an important, but rarely examined genetic parameter.

Application of this approach to data collected from wild-caught Drosophila melanogaster along a latitudinal body-size cline in eastern Australia revealed that asymmetrical gene flow could be detected, but was uncommon, nonlocalized, and occurred in both directions. We also show that, in contrast to the findings of a previous study, there is good evidence to suggest that the cline experiences significant levels of gene flow between populations.",2003,"W Jason Kennington, Julia Gockel, Linda Partridge, W Jason Kennington, Julia Gockel, Linda Partridge"
Drosophila DSP1 and rat HMGB1 have equivalent DNA binding properties and share a similar secondary fold,12761302,10.1093/jb/mvg063,"The protein DSP1 belongs to the group of HMG-box proteins, which share the common structural feature of the HMG-box. This approximately 80 amino acid long motif binds DNA via the minor groove. DSP1 was discovered as a transcriptional co-repressor of Dorsal in Drosophila melanogaster and then was shown to participate to the remodeling of chromatin. By means of sequence alignment and gene organization, DSP1 was classified as the fly homologue of the vertebrate proteins HMGB1/2. DSP1 contains two HMG boxes flanked by two glutamine-rich domains at the N-terminus. In addition, the HMG domain of DSP1 displays two differences in its primary sequence as compared to the vertebrate HMGB1: a shorter acidic tail and a linker between the two boxes longer by 6 amino acids. By comparing several functional parameters of DSP1 with those of HMGB1, the present study establishes the functional equivalence of both proteins in terms of DNA recognition. The major structural difference between the two proteins, the glutamine-rich N-terminal tail of DSP1, which does not exist in HMGB1, did not interfere with any of the studied DNA-binding properties of the proteins.",2003,"Carsten Janke, Davy Martin, Marie-JosÃ¨phe Giraud-Panis, Martine Decoville, Daniel Locker, Carsten Janke, Davy Martin, Marie-JosÃ¨phe Giraud-Panis, Martine Decoville, Daniel Locker"

We used analysis of variance to partition variation in transcript abundance between males and females and between smi genotypes and to determine the genotype-by-sex interaction. A total of 666 genes showed sexual dimorphism in transcript abundance, and 530 genes were coregulated in response to one or more smi mutations, showing considerable epistasis at the level of the transcriptome in response to single mutations. Quantitative complementation tests of mutations at these coregulated genes with the smi mutations showed that in most cases (67%) epistatic interactions for olfactory behavior mirrored epistasis at the level of transcription, thus identifying new candidate genes regulating olfactory behavior.",2003,"Robert R H Anholt, Christy L Dilda, Sherman Chang, Juan-JosÃ© Fanara, Nalini H Kulkarni, Indrani Ganguly, Stephanie M Rollmann, Kim P Kamdar, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt, Christy L Dilda, Sherman Chang, Juan-JosÃ© Fanara, Nalini H Kulkarni, Indrani Ganguly, Stephanie M Rollmann, Kim P Kamdar, Trudy F C Mackay"

A. tabida has no negative impact on host cellular defenses and its eggs avoid encapsulation by adhering to host tissues. At the opposite, we found that A. citri, whose eggs are devoid of adhesive properties, affects the host encapsulation abilities, hemolymph phenoloxidase activity and concentrations of circulating hemocytes. Some of these effects could directly rely on a severe disruption of the hematopoietic organ anterior lobes observed in parasitized larvae.

Here I reanalyze two data sets on geotaxis from Pyle (1978) and Ksander (1966) using a biometrical genetic design. Results from the biometrical genetic reanalysis suggest that individual differences in geotaxis might be due to genes on all three major chromosomes which show extensive epistatic interactions.,1992,"T R McGuire, T R McGuire"

The Gpdh locus was duplicated in about one-third of the lines, although the duplication was incomplete and lacked exons 1 and 2. There was no restriction site variation in the duplicated region. Three insertions were found in the gene region but only one affected GPDH activity. The lines with the duplication had higher levels of GPDH activity and protein amount than did nonduplicated lines. This effect was also observed in lines extracted from two other Australian populations. The duplication is shown to have a similar structure in each population investigated and is also present in populations from China and Africa. It is suggested that the effect of the duplication on GPDH activity, which might be due to structural factors affecting transcription at the Gpdh locus, could account for the worldwide distribution of the duplication.",1992,"J E Symonds, J B Gibson, J E Symonds, J B Gibson"
Analysis of the gene encoding a 16-kDa proteolipid subunit of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase from Manduca sexta midgut and tubules,1283142,10.1016/0378-1119(92)90226-f,"Vacuolar ATPases (V-ATPases), originally characterised as components of endomembranes, have also been implicated in epithelial ion transport, both in vertebrates and in insects. The ATPase is particularly noteworthy in lepidopteran larvae, where it generates large transepithelial potential differences and short-circuit currents across the midgut epithelium. A cDNA library from Manduca sexta larval midguts and Malpighian tubules was screened with a Drosophila melanogaster cDNA encoding the 16-kDa proteolipid subunit of the V-ATPase, and a 1.4-kb cDNA sequenced in its entirety. The sequence contains a long open reading frame, encoding a putative peptide of 156 amino acids (aa) and with an M(r) of 15,967, in close agreement with values previously suggested by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of M. sexta midgut proteins. Correspondence of the deduced aa sequence with those of other species, particularly D. melanogaster, was extremely close. Northern blots of M. sexta midgut mRNA at high stringency revealed two transcripts of 1.4 and 1.9 kb, whereas genomic Southern blots suggest that there is only a single copy of the gene in M. sexta.

The DGK gene was mapped to the cytogenetic position 43F1, and its DGK mRNA is abundant both in embryo and in adult fly. By in situ hybridization to sections of adult flies, we demonstrated that the mRNA is present predominantly in the nervous system and muscles, including compound eyes, brain cortex, fibrillar muscle, and tubular muscle. In a 10- to 11-hr embryo, the DGK gene is expressed abundantly in a limited number of cells in the procephalic region and in the ventral nerve cord.

In these domains ap is highly similar to the mec-3 and lin-11 proteins of Caenorhabditis elegans and to the vertebrate insulin enhancer-binding protein isl-1. ap is presumably required for transcriptional regulation of genes involved in wing and haltere development. The nature of the defects in homozygous null mutant flies is consistent with the pattern of ap expression in the larval imaginal discs. ap is also expressed in a complex pattern in the embryo, including portions of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS).

Analysis of repolarization of presynaptic motor terminals in Drosophila larvae using potassium-channel-blocking drugs and mutations,1328458,,"In Drosophila melanogaster muscles and neuronal cell bodies at least four different potassium currents have been identified whose activity shapes the electrical properties of these cells. Potassium currents also control repolarization of presynaptic terminals and, therefore, exert a major effect on transmitter release and synaptic plasticity. However, because of the small size of presynaptic terminals in Drosophila, it has not been possible to analyze the potassium currents they express. As a first approach to characterizing the ionic currents present at presynaptic motor terminals of Drosophila larvae, we recorded synaptic currents at the neuromuscular junction. From the alterations in evoked synaptic currents caused by various drugs and by mutations known to affect potassium currents in other tissues, we suggest that the repolarizing mechanism in presynaptic terminals consists of at least four distinct currents. One is affected by aminopyridines or Sh mutations, a second component is affected by the slo mutation, a third is sensitive to quinidine and one or more additional components are blocked by tetraethylammonium. Depolarization depends on a presynaptic calcium current, which displays only slight voltage-dependent inactivation. Because the mechanism of repolarization exerts a major effect on synaptic activity, this analysis provides a framework for further genetic and molecular dissection of the basic processes involved in the regulation of transmitter release.",1992,"M Gho, B Ganetzky, M Gho, B Ganetzky"

None of the restriction site polymorphisms, nor any of the insertions, showed a significant association with latitude. A 0.2 kb deletion varied with latitude in the Chinese populations. In accordance with previous studies, a majority of the insertions were located in a region 1.5-3.5 kb 3' from the Adh coding region, and a majority of the deletions were at a site 3 kb 5' to the Adh coding region.

[Comparative analysis of the localization and mobility of retrotransposons in sibling species Drosophila simulans and Drosophila melanogaster],1322343,,"The distribution of four retrotransposon families (MDG1, MDG3, MDG4 and copia) on polytene chromosomes of different (from 9 to 15) Drosophila simulans strains is studied. The mean number of MDG1 and copia euchromatic hybridization sites (3 sites for each element) is drastically decreased in D. simulans in comparison with D. melanogaster (24 and 18 sites respectively). The mean number of MDG3 sites of hybridization is 5 in D. simulans against 12 in D. melanogaster. As for MDG4 both species have on the average about 2-3 euchromatic sites. The majority of MDG1 and copia and about a half of MDG3 euchromatic copies are localized in restricted number of sites (hot spots) on D. simulans polytene chromosomes. In D. melanogaster these elements are scattered along the chromosomes though there are some hot spots too.

DIRECT AND CORRELATED RESPONSES TO SELECTION ON AGE AT REPRODUCTION IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,28564973,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1992.tb01986.x,"Aging may be a consequence of mutation accumulation or of negative pleiotropic correlations between performance late and earlier in the lifespan. This study used artificial selection on flies derived from two different base stocks to produce ""young"" and ""old"" lines, propagated by breeding from young and old adults respectively. Virgin and mated adults of both sexes from the ""old"" lines lived longer than ""young"" line flies. ""Young"" and ""old"" mated females did not differ in fecundity or fertility early in the lifespan, but ""old"" line females had higher fecundity and fertility late in life. The results therefore suggested either that the response to selection had revealed the effect of mutation accumulation, or that pleiotropy involving characters other than early fecundity must have been involved. Development time from egg to adult was longer in the ""old"" lines. Competition of selected line larvae from one base stock against mutant marked larvae from the same base stock revealed that, at a wide range of larval densities, ""old"" line larvae showed lower survival rates than ""young"" line larvae. Thorax length and wet weight were significantly greater in the ""old"" line flies from one base stock. The results may imply that the selection regime in the ""old"" lines favored extended growth during development to produce a more durable adult soma, despite the cost in increased larval mortality and delayed reproduction, because the potential reproductive benefits later in life were increased. However, the differences between larvae from ""old"" and ""young"" lines could also be attributable to density differences, and this possibility needs systematic investigation.",1992,"Linda Partridge, Kevin Fowler, Linda Partridge, Kevin Fowler"

The pqp protein is also present at a lower level in the nuclei of follicle cells, embryos, and larvae. By means of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screen, we recovered three independent and phenotypeless P-element insertions at the pqp locus. In a second step, two excision-induced deletions of the pqp gene were isolated after mobilization of one of these P elements. The pqp mutants display zygotic (spread and drooping wings, cross-vein defects, extra bristles) and maternal (embryonic lethality) recessive phenotypes. The chromosomal position (98EF) of the pqp gene and the drooping wing phenotype of the pqp mutants agree with the hypothesis that the pqp gene is the wings down (wdn) gene for which T.H. Morgan isolated (and lost) mutants in the 1920s.

The distribution of spontaneous mutations on quantitative traits and fitness in Drosophila melanogaster,1468629,,"Starting from a completely homozygous population of Drosophila melanogaster, two groups of 100 inbred lines each were established and maintained for 46 generations, by a single brother-sister mating and two double first cousin matings, respectively. Sternopleural bristle number, wing length and wing width were simultaneously scored in all lines every 4-5 generations. The means of four lines in each group departed significantly from the overall mean and, in each case, this was attributed to a single mutation of relatively large effect on at least one trait (0.3-1.4 environmental standard deviations in absolute value). Further analyses revealed widespread pleiotropy, similar gene action of a given mutation for all traits affected, and predominant additive action. No apparent association was found between the magnitudes of mutational effects on the traits and fitness. However, all recessive mutations were deleterious. The distribution of mutant effects was asymmetrical (positive for bristles and negative for wing measurements). Moreover, these distributions had a high variance and may be leptokurtic, due to the presence of major genes. Estimates of the ratio of new mutational variance to environmental variance ranged within (0.7-3.4) x 10(-3), those for wing measurements being generally larger. In agreement with theory, the rate of between-line differentiation was independent of population size.",1992,"E Santiago, J Albornoz, A DomÃ­nguez, M A Toro, C LÃ³pez-Fanjul, E Santiago, J Albornoz, A DomÃ­nguez, M A Toro, C LÃ³pez-Fanjul"
Structure/activity relationships of the genotoxic potencies of sixteen pyrrolizidine alkaloids assayed for the induction of somatic mutation and recombination in wing cells of Drosophila melanogaster,1643665,10.1016/0009-2797(92)90088-3,"Sixteen pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) were examined for their genotoxic potency in the wing spot test of Drosophila melanogaster following oral application. This in vivo assay tests for the induction of somatic mutation and mitotic recombination in cells of the developing wing primordia. All PAs tested except the C9-monoester supinine were clearly genotoxic. Depending on their chemical structure, however, genotoxicity of the PAs varied widely in a range encompassing about three orders of magnitude. In general, macrocyclic diester-type PAs were the most and 7-hydroxy C9-monoester types the least genotoxic representatives studied, while open diesters were intermediate in this respect. Stereoisomeric PAs mostly showed similar, but sometimes also clearly unequal genotoxicity. An increasing number of hydroxy groups in the PA molecule seemed to reduce its genotoxic potency. With respect to the structure/activity relationships, there appears to be a good correlation between hepatotoxicity of PAs in experimental rodents and genotoxicity in the wing spot test of Drosophila. This suggests that PAs are bioactivated along similar pathways in the mammalian liver and in the somatic cells of Drosophila. The genotoxic potential of PAs in the Drosophila wing spot test and their carcinogenic potential in mammals also seem correlated, although the information in the literature on carcinogenicity of the non-macrocyclic PAs with moderate to low genotoxic potency is concededly limited. Comparisons with other genotoxicity tests suggest that the wing spot test is particularly suitable for genotoxins like PAs, on the one hand because of the versatile metabolic bioactivation system of Drosophila and on the other hand also because of its excellent sensitivity to the crosslinking agents among the genotoxins.",1992,"H Frei, J LÃ¼thy, J Brauchli, U Zweifel, F E WÃ¼rgler, C Schlatter, H Frei, J LÃ¼thy, J Brauchli, U Zweifel, F E WÃ¼rgler, C Schlatter"
Genetic basis for female receptivity in Drosophila melanogaster: a diallel study,1428955,10.1038/hdy.1992.142,"Receptivity of sexually mature, virgin females, measured as the time to copulation, has been investigated. Two independent 5 x 5 diallel crosses were carried out, each one with a different male tester genotype. Interactions between male and female genotypes were detected because some lines appeared as dominant in one diallel and recessive in the other. The overall picture emerging from the analyses shows a genetic system for female receptivity characterized by additive genes, with dominance for high receptivity in one of the diallel crosses. This remarkable additive component does not support the action of natural selection favouring females with extreme values of receptivity, rather, the lack of intrasexual female competition for mates is suggested.",1992,"P Casares, M C Carracedo, R PiÃ±eiro, E San Miguel, L Garcia-Florez, P Casares, M C Carracedo, R PiÃ±eiro, E San Miguel, L Garcia-Florez"
Toward a comprehensive genetic analysis of male fertility in Drosophila melanogaster,15166148,10.1534/genetics.167.1.207,"Drosophila melanogaster is a widely used model organism for genetic dissection of developmental processes. To exploit its full potential for studying the genetic basis of male fertility, we performed a large-scale screen for male-sterile (ms) mutations. From a collection of 12,326 strains carrying ethyl-methanesulfonate-treated, homozygous viable second or third chromosomes, 2216 ms lines were identified, constituting the largest collection of ms mutations described to date for any organism. Over 2000 lines were cytologically characterized and, of these, 81% failed during spermatogenesis while 19% manifested postspermatogenic processes. Of the phenotypic categories used to classify the mutants, the largest groups were those that showed visible defects in meiotic chromosome segregation or cytokinesis and those that failed in sperm individualization. We also identified 62 fertile or subfertile lines that showed high levels of chromosome loss due to abnormal mitotic or meiotic chromosome transmission in the male germ line or due to paternal chromosome loss in the early embryo. We argue that the majority of autosomal genes that function in male fertility in Drosophila are represented by one or more alleles in the ms collection. Given the conservation of molecular mechanisms underlying important cellular processes, analysis of these mutations should provide insight into the genetic networks that control male fertility in Drosophila and other organisms, including humans.",2004,"Barbara T Wakimoto, Dan L Lindsley, Cheryl Herrera, Barbara T Wakimoto, Dan L Lindsley, Cheryl Herrera"
Drosophila dFOXO controls lifespan and regulates insulin signalling in brain and fat body,15175753,10.1038/nature02549,"In Drosophila melanogaster, ageing is slowed when insulin-like signalling is reduced: life expectancy is extended by more than 50% when the insulin-like receptor (InR) or its receptor substrate (chico) are mutated, or when insulin-producing cells are ablated. But we have yet to resolve when insulin affects ageing, or whether insulin signals regulate ageing directly or indirectly through secondary hormones. Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan is also extended when insulin signalling is inhibited in certain tissues, or when repressed in adult worms, and this requires the forkhead transcription factor (FOXO) encoded by daf-16 (ref. 6). The D. melanogaster insulin-like receptor mediates phosphorylation of dFOXO, the equivalent of nematode daf-16 and mammalian FOXO3a. We demonstrate here that dFOXO regulates D. melanogaster ageing when activated in the adult pericerebral fat body. We further show that this limited activation of dFOXO reduces expression of the Drosophila insulin-like peptide dilp-2 synthesized in neurons, and represses endogenous insulin-dependent signalling in peripheral fat body. These findings suggest that autonomous and non-autonomous roles of insulin signalling combine to control ageing.",2004,"Dae Sung Hwangbo, Boris Gershman, Meng-Ping Tu, Michael Palmer, Marc Tatar, Dae Sung Hwangbo, Boris Gershman, Meng-Ping Tu, Michael Palmer, Marc Tatar"
Median bundle neurons coordinate behaviours during Drosophila male courtship,15282607,10.1038/nature02713,"Throughout the animal kingdom the innate nature of basic behaviour routines suggests that the underlying neuronal substrates necessary for their execution are genetically determined and developmentally programmed. Complex innate behaviours require proper timing and ordering of individual component behaviours. In Drosophila melanogaster, analyses of combinations of mutations of the fruitless (fru) gene have shown that male-specific isoforms (Fru(M)) of the Fru transcription factor are necessary for proper execution of all steps of the innate courtship ritual. Here, we eliminate Fru(M) expression in one group of about 60 neurons in the Drosophila central nervous system and observe severely contracted courtship behaviour, including rapid courtship initiation, absence of orienting and tapping, and the simultaneous occurrence of wing vibration, licking and attempted copulation. Our results identify a small group of median bundle neurons, that in wild-type Drosophila appropriately trigger the sequential execution of the component behaviours that constitute the Drosophila courtship ritual.",2004,"Devanand S Manoli, Bruce S Baker, Devanand S Manoli, Bruce S Baker"

They are phagocytosed by specialized blood cells, surrounded by toxic melanin, or lysed by antibacterial peptides secreted into the hemolymph by fat body cells.

"Development and morphology of class II Kenyon cells in the mushroom bodies of the honey bee, Apis mellifera",15174077,10.1002/cne.20146,"Class II Kenyon cells, defined by their early birthdate and unique dendritic arborizations, have been observed in the mushroom bodies of evolutionarily divergent insects. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, Class II (also called clawed) Kenyon cells are well known for their extensive reorganization that occurs during metamorphosis. The present account reports for the first time the occurrence of mushroom body reorganization during metamorphosis in holometabolous insect species outside of the Diptera. In the honey bee, Apis mellifera, Class II Kenyon cells show signs of degeneration and undergo a subtle reshaping of their axons during metamorphosis. Unlike in Drosophila, reorganization of Class II Kenyon cells in the honey bee does not involve the loss of axon branches. In contrast, the mushroom bodies of closely related hymenopteran species, the polistine wasps, undergo a much more dramatic restructuring near the end of metamorphosis. Immunohistochemistry, dextran fills, and Golgi impregnations illuminate the heterogeneous nature of Class II Kenyon cells in the developing and adult honey bee brain, with subpopulations differing in the location of dendritic arbors within the calyx, and branching pattern in the lobes. Furthermore, polyclonal antibodies against the catalytic subunit of Drosophila protein kinase A (anti-DC0) label an unusual and previously undescribed trajectory for these neurons. The observed variations in morphology indicate that subpopulations of Class II Kenyon cells in the honey bee can likely be further defined by significant differences in their specific connections and functions within the mushroom bodies.",2004,"Sarah M Farris, Andrew I Abrams, Nicholas J Strausfeld, Sarah M Farris, Andrew I Abrams, Nicholas J Strausfeld"
A computational search for box C/D snoRNA genes in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,15247100,10.1093/bioinformatics/bth394,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      In eukaryotes, the family of non-coding RNA genes includes a number of genes encoding small nucleolar RNAs (mainly C/D and H/ACA snoRNAs), which act as guides in the maturation or post-transcriptional modifications of target RNA molecules. Since in Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) only few examples of snoRNAs have been identified so far by cDNA libraries screening, integration of the molecular data with in silico identification of these types of genes could throw light on their organization in the Dm genome.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We have performed a computational screening of the Dm genome for C/D snoRNA genes, followed by experimental validation of the putative candidates. Few of the 26 confirmed snoRNAs had been recognized by cDNA library analysis. Organization of the Dm genome was also found to be more variegated than previously suspected, with snoRNA genes nested in both the introns and exons of protein-coding genes. This finding suggests that the presence of additional mechanisms of snoRNA biogenesis based on the alternative production of overlapping mRNA/snoRNA molecules.

Molecular and comparative genetics of mental retardation,15020472,10.1534/genetics.166.2.835,"Affecting 1-3% of the population, mental retardation (MR) poses significant challenges for clinicians and scientists. Understanding the biology of MR is complicated by the extraordinary heterogeneity of genetic MR disorders. Detailed analyses of >1000 Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database entries and literature searches through September 2003 revealed 282 molecularly identified MR genes. We estimate that hundreds more MR genes remain to be identified. A novel test, in which we distributed unmapped MR disorders proportionately across the autosomes, failed to eliminate the well-known X-chromosome overrepresentation of MR genes and candidate genes. This evidence argues against ascertainment bias as the main cause of the skewed distribution. On the basis of a synthesis of clinical and laboratory data, we developed a biological functions classification scheme for MR genes. Metabolic pathways, signaling pathways, and transcription are the most common functions, but numerous other aspects of neuronal and glial biology are controlled by MR genes as well. Using protein sequence and domain-organization comparisons, we found a striking conservation of MR genes and genetic pathways across the approximately 700 million years that separate Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster. Eighty-seven percent have one or more fruit fly homologs and 76% have at least one candidate functional ortholog. We propose that D. melanogaster can be used in a systematic manner to study MR and possibly to develop bioassays for therapeutic drug discovery. We selected 42 Drosophila orthologs as most likely to reveal molecular and cellular mechanisms of nervous system development or plasticity relevant to MR.",2004,"Jennifer K Inlow, Linda L Restifo, Jennifer K Inlow, Linda L Restifo"

To gain insight into the mechanism(s) by which chromosomal insulation occurs, we studied the expression phenotypes of Drosophila transformants expressing mini-white transgenes in which MAR sequences from the human apoB gene were arranged in a variety of ways. In agreement with previous reports, we found that a single copy of the insulating element was not sufficient for position-independent transgene expression; rather, two copies were required. However, the arrangement of the two elements within the transgene was unimportant, since chromosomal insulation was equally apparent when both copies of the insulator were upstream of the mini-white reporter as when the transcription unit was flanked by insulator elements. Moreover, experiments in which apoB 3' MAR sequences were removed from integrated transgenes in vivo by site-specific recombination demonstrated that MAR sequences were required for the establishment but not for the maintenance of chromosomal insulation. These observations are not compatible with the chromosomal loop model in its simplest form. Alternate mechanisms for MAR function in this system are proposed.",2004,"Stephanie J Namciu, R E K Fournier, Stephanie J Namciu, R E K Fournier"

Egg-to-adult viability was assayed for nonlethal homozygous chromosomes. The rates of decline in mean and increase in variance (DM and DV, respectively) were estimated. Scaled up to the diploid whole genome, the mean DM for homozygous detrimental mutations over the three experiments was between 0.8 and 1.8%. The corresponding DV estimate was approximately 0.11%. Overall, the results suggest a lower bound estimate of at least 12% for the diploid per genome mutation rate for detrimentals. The upper bound estimates for the mean selection coefficient were between 2 and 10%, depending on the method used. Mutations with selection coefficients of at least a few percent must be the major contributors to the effects detected here and are likely to be caused mostly by transposable element insertions or indels.",2004,"Brian Charlesworth, Helen Borthwick, Carolina BartolomÃ©, Patricia Pignatelli, Brian Charlesworth, Helen Borthwick, Carolina BartolomÃ©, Patricia Pignatelli"
"Free aminothiols, glutathione redox state and protein mixed disulphides in aging Drosophila melanogaster",15142037,10.1042/BJ20040506,"The main purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the aging process is associated with a pro-oxidizing shift in the cellular redox state. The amounts of the redox-sensitive free aminothiols (glutathione, cysteine, Cys-Gly and methionine) and protein mixed disulphides were measured at different ages and ambient temperatures in Drosophila melanogaster. GSH/GSSG ratios decreased significantly with increasing age of the flies, due to an increase in GSSG content. Concentrations of Cys-Gly increased and methionine decreased with age. The amounts of protein mixed disulphides, measured as protein-cysteinyl, protein-Cys-Gly and protein-glutathionyl mixed disulphides, increased as a function of age. The pattern of changes in free aminothiol content, glutathione-redox state and protein mixed disulphides varied in proportion to the ambient temperature, which is inversely related to the life expectancy of the flies. Collectively, these results support the idea that the pro-oxidizing shift in the glutathione-redox state, the decrease in methionine content and increase in abundance of protein mixed disulphides are associated with the life expectancy of flies, and are indicative of enhanced oxidative stress during aging.",2004,"Igor Rebrin, Anne-CÃ©cile V Bayne, Robin J Mockett, William C Orr, Rajindar S Sohal, Igor Rebrin, Anne-CÃ©cile V Bayne, Robin J Mockett, William C Orr, Rajindar S Sohal"
The Drosophila gene Start1: a putative cholesterol transporter and key regulator of ecdysteroid synthesis,14745013,10.1073/pnas.0308212100,"Human metastatic lymph node 64 (MLN64) is a transmembrane protein that shares homology with the cholesterol-binding vertebrate steroid acute regulatory protein (StAR)-related lipid transfer domain (START) and is involved in cholesterol traffic and steroid synthesis. We identified a Drosophila melanogaster gene whose putative protein product shows extensive homology with MLN64 and that we name Start1 (FlyBase CG3522). The putative Start1 protein, derived from Start1 cDNA sequences, contains an additional 122 aa of unknown function within the StAR-related lipid transfer domain. Similar inserts seem to exist in the Start1 homologues of Drosophila pseudoobscura and Anopheles gambiae, but not in the homologous protein of the urochordate Ciona intestinalis. Immunostaining using an insert-specific antibody confirms the presence of the insert in the cytoplasm. Whereas RT-PCR data indicate that Start1 is expressed ubiquitously, RNA in situ hybridizations demonstrate its overexpression in prothoracic gland cells, where ecdysteroids are synthesized from cholesterol. Transcripts of Start1 are detectable in embryonic ring gland progenitor cells and are abundant in prothoracic glands of larvae showing wave-like expression during larval stages. In adults, Start1 is expressed in nurse cells of the ovary. These observations are consistent with the assumption that Start1 plays a key role in the regulation of ecdysteroid synthesis. Vice versa, the expression of Start1 itself seems to depend on ecdysone, as in the ecdysone-deficient mutant ecd-1, Start1 expression is severely reduced.",2004,"Guenther E Roth, Mathias S Gierl, Lars Vollborn, Martin Meise, Ruth Lintermann, Guenter Korge, Guenther E Roth, Mathias S Gierl, Lars Vollborn, Martin Meise, Ruth Lintermann, Guenter Korge"
Lifespan extension by dietary restriction in female Drosophila melanogaster is not caused by a reduction in vitellogenesis or ovarian activity,15236760,10.1016/j.exger.2004.03.018,"Dietary restriction (DR) extends lifespan in a wide range of organisms. DR also reduces daily and lifetime fecundity. The latter may be an evolutionary adaptation to survive periods of food shortage. Reproductive rate is often negatively correlated with lifespan, and a reduced cost of reproduction could be the mechanism by which DR extends lifespan. We tested this hypothesis in Drosophila melanogaster females, by directly suppressing different aspects of reproduction and measuring the effect on the response of lifespan and age-specific mortality to DR. DR resulted in lifespan extension in females kept with males, in females kept without males, in females with vitellogenesis blocked by the mutant ovoD1 and in females with no germline as a result of X-irradiation. Moreover, rapid (48 h) changes in age-specific mortality, previously seen in fertile females switched between full feeding and DR, were also seen in ovoD1 females. Furthermore, these rapid changes in age-specific mortality in cohorts of fertile wild type females were not accompanied by concurrent changes in egg-production. These results indicate either that reduced reproduction is not necessary for lifespan extension by DR in Drosophila females, or that the relevant aspects of reproduction act upstream of our interventions and were therefore not blocked in our experiments.",2004,"William Mair, Carla M SgrÃ², Alice P Johnson, Tracey Chapman, Linda Partridge, William Mair, Carla M SgrÃ², Alice P Johnson, Tracey Chapman, Linda Partridge"

Decreased lifespan in the absence of expression of the mitochondrial small heat shock protein Hsp22 in Drosophila,15331597,10.1074/jbc.C400357200,"Aging is a well regulated biological process involving oxidative stress and macromolecular damages. Three main pathways have been shown to influence lifespan, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 pathway, the silent regulator pathway, and the target of rapamycin pathway. Among many proteins influencing lifespan, two transcription factors, FOXO and the heat shock factor, have been shown to be involved in the aging process and in small heat shock proteins (sHsps) expression following stress and during lifespan. We have recently shown that overexpressing the mitochondrial Hsp22 increases Drosophila melanogaster lifespan by 32% and resistance to oxidative stress. Here we show that flies that are not expressing this mitochondrial small Hsp22 have a 40% decrease in lifespan. These flies die faster than their matched control and display a decrease of 30% in locomotor activity compared with controls. The absence of Hsp22 also sensitizes flies to mild stress.

To further investigate and verify long-range pairing in Drosophila Adh with respect to models of compensatory evolution and its potential functional role, we introduced site-directed mutations in the Drosophila melanogaster Adh gene. We explore two alternative hypotheses for why previous analysis of long-range compensatory interactions failed to fit the classical model. Specifically, we investigate whether the disruption of a conserved short-range pairing within Adh exon 2 has an effect on Adh expression or if there is a dual functional role of a conserved sequence in the 3'-UTR in both long-range pairing and the negative regulation of Adh expression. We find that a classical result was not observed due to the pleiotropic effect of changing a nucleotide involved in both long-range base pairing and the negative regulation of gene expression.",2004,"John F Baines, John Parsch, Wolfgang Stephan, John F Baines, John Parsch, Wolfgang Stephan"

Polymerase chain reaction primers were designed to amplify the predicted exons of all chromosome 4 genes, and homozygous embryos for each deficiency were identified and their DNA used to test for the presence or absence of these exons. By testing for the inability to amplify various exons along the length of the chromosome, we were able to determine which predicted genes are missing in each deficiency. The five deficiencies, Df(4)G, Df(4)C3, Df(4)C1-10AT, and Df(4)B2-20 (all terminal deletions), and Df(4)M101-62f (a proximal interstitial deletion), enabled us to partition the gene-containing, right arm of chromosome 4 into five regions. Region A [uncovered by Df(4)M101-62f] contains the proximal-most 21 genes; region B [uncovered by Df(4)B2-2D] contains the next 12 genes; region C [uncovered by Df(4)B2-2D and Df(4)C1-10AT] contains the next 17 genes; region D [uncovered by Df(4)B2-2D, Df(4)C1-10AT, and Df(4)C3] contains the next 21 genes; and region E [uncovered by Df(4)B2-2D, Df(4)C1-10AT, Df(4)C3, and Df(4)G] contains the distal-most ten genes.

Targeted expression of the class II phosphoinositide 3-kinase in Drosophila melanogaster reveals lipid kinase-dependent effects on patterning and interactions with receptor signaling pathways,14701751,10.1128/mcb.24.2.796-808.2004,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) can be divided into three distinct classes (I, II, and III) on the basis of their domain structures and the lipid signals that they generate. Functions have been assigned to the class I and class III enzymes but have not been established for the class II PI3Ks. We have obtained the first evidence for a biological function for a class II PI3K by expressing this enzyme during Drosophila melanogaster development and by using deficiencies that remove the endogenous gene. Wild-type and catalytically inactive PI3K_68D transgenes have opposite effects on the number of sensory bristles and on wing venation phenotypes induced by modified epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling. These results indicate that the endogenous PI3K_68D may act antagonistically to the EGF receptor-stimulated Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and downstream of, or parallel to, the Notch receptor. A class II polyproline motif in PI3K_68D can bind the Drk adaptor protein in vitro, primarily via the N-terminal SH3 domain of Drk. Drk may thus be important for the localization of PI3K_68D, allowing it to modify signaling pathways downstream of cell surface receptors. The phenotypes obtained are markedly distinct from those generated by expression of the Drosophila class I PI3K, which affects growth but not pattern formation.",2004,"Lindsay K MacDougall, Mary Elizabeth Gagou, Sally J Leevers, Ernst Hafen, Michael D Waterfield, Lindsay K MacDougall, Mary Elizabeth Gagou, Sally J Leevers, Ernst Hafen, Michael D Waterfield"
The Zuker collection: a resource for the analysis of autosomal gene function in Drosophila melanogaster,15166147,10.1534/genetics.167.1.203,"The majority of genes of multicellular organisms encode proteins with functions that are not required for viability but contribute to important physiological functions such as behavior and reproduction. It is estimated that 75% of the genes of Drosophila melanogaster are nonessential. Here we report on a strategy used to establish a large collection of stocks that is suitable for the recovery of mutations in such genes. From approximately 72,000 F(3) cultures segregating for autosomes heavily treated with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), approximately 12,000 lines in which the treated second or third chromosome survived in homozygous condition were selected. The dose of EMS induced an estimated rate of 1.2-1.5 x 10(-3) mutations/gene and predicts five to six nonessential gene mutations per chromosome and seven to nine alleles per locus in the samples of 6000 second chromosomes and 6000 third chromosomes. Due to mosaic mutations induced in the initial exposure to the mutagen, many of the lines are segregating or are now fixed for lethal mutations on the mutagenized chromosome. The features of this collection, known as the Zuker collection, make it a valuable resource for forward and reverse genetic screens for mutations affecting a wide array of biological functions.",2004,"Edmund J Koundakjian, David M Cowan, Robert W Hardy, Ann H Becker, Edmund J Koundakjian, David M Cowan, Robert W Hardy, Ann H Becker"
Gene deletions by ends-in targeting in Drosophila melanogaster,15579700,10.1534/genetics.104.030882,"Following the advent of a gene targeting technique in Drosophila, different methods have been developed to modify the Drosophila genome. The initial demonstration of gene targeting in flies used an ends-in method, which generates a duplication of the target locus. The duplicated locus can then be efficiently reduced to a single copy by generating a double-strand break between the duplicated segments. This method has been used to knock out target genes by introducing point mutations. A derivative of this method is reported here. By using different homologous regions for the targeting and reduction steps, a complete deletion of the target gene can be generated to produce a definitive null allele. The breakpoints of the deletion can be precisely controlled. Unlike ends-out targeting, this method does not leave exogenous sequence at the deleted locus. Three endogenous genes, Sir2, Sirt2, and p53 have been successfully deleted using this method.",2004,"Heng B Xie, Kent G Golic, Heng B Xie, Kent G Golic"

Duplicative and conservative transpositions of larval serum protein 1 genes in the genus Drosophila,15454541,10.1534/genetics.103.025916,"Interspecific comparative molecular analyses of transposed genes and their flanking regions can help to elucidate the time, direction, and mechanism of gene transposition. In the Drosophila melanogaster genome, three Larval serum protein 1 (Lsp1) genes (alpha, beta and gamma) are present and each of them is located on a different chromosome, suggesting multiple transposition events. We have characterized the molecular organization of Lsp1 genes in D. buzzatii, a species of the Drosophila subgenus and in D. pseudoobscura, a species of the Sophophora subgenus. Our results show that only two Lsp1 genes (beta and gamma) exist in these two species. The same chromosomal localization and genomic organization, different from that of D. melanogaster, is found in both species for the Lsp1beta and Lsp1gamma genes. Overall, at least two duplicative and two conservative transpositions are necessary to explain the present chromosomal distribution of Lsp1 genes in the three Drosophila species. Clear evidence for implication of snRNA genes in the transposition of Lsp1beta in Drosophila has been found. We suggest that an ectopic exchange between highly similar snRNA sequences was responsible for the transposition of this gene. We have also identified the putative cis-acting regulatory regions of these genes, which seemingly transposed along with the coding sequences.",2004,"Josefa GonzÃ¡lez, Ferran Casals, Alfredo Ruiz, Josefa GonzÃ¡lez, Ferran Casals, Alfredo Ruiz"
Argos inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor signalling by ligand sequestration,15329724,10.1038/nature02840,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has critical functions in development and in many human cancers. During development, the spatial extent of EGFR signalling is regulated by feedback loops comprising both well-understood activators and less well-characterized inhibitors. In Drosophila melanogaster the secreted protein Argos functions as the only known extracellular inhibitor of EGFR, with clearly identified roles in multiple stages of development. Argos is only expressed when the Drosophila EGFR (DER) is activated at high levels, and downregulates further DER signalling. Although there is ample genetic evidence that Argos inhibits DER activation, the biochemical mechanism has not been established. Here we show that Argos inhibits DER signalling without interacting directly with the receptor, but instead by sequestering the DER-activating ligand Spitz. Argos binds tightly to the EGF motif of Spitz and forms a 1:1 (Spitz:Argos) complex that does not bind DER in vitro or at the cell surface. Our results provide an insight into the mechanism of Argos function, and suggest new strategies for EGFR inhibitor design.",2004,"Daryl E Klein, Valerie M Nappi, Gregory T Reeves, Stanislav Y Shvartsman, Mark A Lemmon, Daryl E Klein, Valerie M Nappi, Gregory T Reeves, Stanislav Y Shvartsman, Mark A Lemmon"

Here, we compare the molecular architecture and embryonic expression pattern of the 18 genes encoding ZP proteins in Drosophila melanogaster. Only five of these genes have been genetically characterized. All ZP genes are expressed in the embryo in epithelial tissues, such as the foregut, the hindgut, the Malpighian tubules, the salivary glands, the tracheal system, sensory organs and epidermis.

The results indicate that: (i) CpG deficiency and the corresponding TpG (CpA) excess show no correlation with the level of DNA methylation; indeed, genomes endowed with strikingly different levels of DNA methylation (such as those of Drosophila and human) exhibited similar TpG (CpA) levels; (ii) the correlation between GC levels of large (50 kb) DNA sequences and TpA or CpG shortage levels do not appear to be due to CpG methylation followed by deamination; (iii) CpG dinucleotides are more frequent in fishes than in mammals; interestingly, the monotreme Ornitorhinchus anatinus shows an intermediate CpG frequency.

Ecologically relevant stress resistance: from microarrays and quantitative trait loci to candidate genes - a research plan and preliminary results using Drosophila as a model organism and climatic and genetic stress as model stresses,15625405,10.1007/BF02712122,"We aim at studying adaptation to genetic and environmental stress and its evolutionary implications at different levels of biological organization. Stress influences cellular processes, individual physiology, genetic variation at the population level, and the process of natural selection. To investigate these highly connected levels of stress effects, it is advisable - if not critical - to integrate approaches from ecology, evolution, physiology, molecular biology and genetics. To investigate the mechanisms of stress resistance, how resistance evolves, and what factors contribute to and constrain its evolution, we use the well-defined model systems of Drosophila species, representing both cosmopolitan species such as D. melanogaster with a known genome map, and more specialized and ecologically well described species such as the cactophilic D. buzzatii. Various climate-related stresses are used as model stresses including desiccation, starvation, cold and heat. Genetic stress or genetic load is modelled by studying the consequences of inbreeding, the accumulation of (slightly) deleterious mutations, hybridization or the loss of genetic variability. We present here a research plan and preliminary results combining various approaches: molecular techniques such as microarrays, quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses, quantitative PCR, ELISA or Western blotting are combined with population studies of resistance to climatic and genetic stress in natural populations collected across climatic gradients as well as in selection lines maintained in the laboratory.",2004,"Volker Loeschcke, Jesper G SÃ¸rensen, Torsten N Kristensen, Volker Loeschcke, Jesper G SÃ¸rensen, Torsten N Kristensen"
"The gene Sex-lethal of the Sciaridae family (order Diptera, suborder Nematocera) and its phylogeny in dipteran insects",15514063,10.1534/genetics.104.031278,"This article reports the cloning and characterization of the gene homologous to Sex-lethal (Sxl) of Drosophila melanogaster from Sciara coprophila, Rhynchosciara americana, and Trichosia pubescens. This gene plays the key role in controlling sex determination and dosage compensation in D. melanogaster. The Sxl gene of the three species studied produces a single transcript encoding a single protein in both males and females. Comparison of the Sxl proteins of these Nematocera insects with those of the Brachycera showed their two RNA-binding domains (RBD) to be highly conserved, whereas significant variation was observed in both the N- and C-terminal domains. The great majority of nucleotide changes in the RBDs were synonymous, indicating that purifying selection is acting on them. In both sexes of the three Nematocera insects, the Sxl protein colocalized with transcription-active regions dependent on RNA polymerase II but not on RNA polymerase I. Together, these results indicate that Sxl does not appear to play a discriminatory role in the control of sex determination and dosage compensation in nematocerans. Thus, in the phylogenetic lineage that gave rise to the drosophilids, evolution coopted for the Sxl gene, modified it, and converted it into the key gene controlling sex determination and dosage compensation. At the same time, however, certain properties of the recruited ancestral Sxl gene were beneficial, and these are maintained in the evolved Sxl gene, allowing it to exert its sex-determining and dose compensation functions in Drosophila.",2004,"Esther Serna, Eduardo Gorab, M Fernanda Ruiz, Clara Goday, JosÃ© M EirÃ­n-LÃ³pez, Lucas SÃ¡nchez, Esther Serna, Eduardo Gorab, M Fernanda Ruiz, Clara Goday, JosÃ© M EirÃ­n-LÃ³pez, Lucas SÃ¡nchez"
"""Plus-C"" odorant-binding protein genes in two Drosophila species and the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae",14960367,10.1016/j.gene.2003.11.007,"Olfaction plays a crucial role in many aspects of insect behaviour, including host selection by agricultural pests and vectors of human disease. Insect odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are thought to function as the first step in molecular recognition and the transport of semiochemicals. The whole genome sequence of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been completed and a large number of genes have been annotated as OBPs, based on the presence of six conserved cysteine residues and a conserved spacing between the cysteines. These proteins can be divided into three distinct subgroups; those with only one six-cysteine motif, those with two such motifs and those with one motif, three extra conserved cysteines and a conserved proline immediately after the sixth cysteine. This study concentrates on the last two subgroups, referred to as 'dimer' OBPs and 'Plus-C' OBPs, respectively. We determined the tissue-specific transcript levels of all of these OBP genes of D. melanogaster using semiquantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that the expression patterns can vary within a subgroup of genes and that this technique is valuable for assessing which of the putative OBP genes are likely to be involved in Drosophila olfaction. The publicly available genomes of another fruit fly Drosophila pseudoobscura, the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae and the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti were searched by Blast against each Plus-C OBP and dimer OBP of D. melanogaster.

One such mechanism, translation invariance, enables organisms to recognize visual patterns independent of the region of their visual field where they had originally seen them. Tethered flies (Drosophila melanogaster) in a flight simulator can recognize visual patterns. Because their eyes are fixed in space and patterns can be displayed in defined parts of their visual field, they can be tested for translation invariance.

In some cases, cell-surface expression of classical nuclear steroid receptors has been suggested to mediate these effects, but, in a few instances, specific G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been reported to be responsible. Here, we describe the activation of a novel, neuronally expressed Drosophila GPCR by the insect ecdysteroids ecdysone (E) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). This is the first report of an identified insect GPCR interacting with steroids. The Drosophila melanogaster dopamine/ecdysteroid receptor (DmDopEcR) shows sequence homology with vertebrate beta-adrenergic receptors and is activated by dopamine (DA) to increase cAMP levels and to activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway. Conversely, E and 20E show high affinity for the receptor in binding studies and can inhibit the effects of DA, as well as coupling the receptor to a rapid activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The receptor may thus represent the Drosophila homolog of the vertebrate ""gamma-adrenergic receptors,"" which are responsible for the modulation of various activities in brain, blood vessels, and pancreas. Thus, DmDopEcR can function as a cell-surface GPCR that may be responsible for some of the rapid, nongenomic actions of ecdysteroids, during both development and signaling in the mature adult nervous system.",2005,"Deepak P Srivastava, Esther J Yu, Karen Kennedy, Heather Chatwin, Vincenzina Reale, Maureen Hamon, Trevor Smith, Peter D Evans, Deepak P Srivastava, Esther J Yu, Karen Kennedy, Heather Chatwin, Vincenzina Reale, Maureen Hamon, Trevor Smith, Peter D Evans"

Tarsus determination in Drosophila melanogaster,16094438,10.1139/g05-021,"Arista versus tarsus determination is well investigated in Drosophila, yet it remains unresolved whether Antennapedia (ANTP) cell autonomously or noncell autonomously determines tarsus identity and whether Sex combs reduced (SCR) is the HOX protein required for normal tarsus determination. Three observations rule out a cell autonomous role for ANTP in tarsus determination. (i) Clonal ectopic overexpression of ANTP did not repress the expression of the arista determining protein Homothorax (HTH) in early 3rd stadium antennal imaginal discs. (ii) Clonal ectopic expression of ANTP did not transform the arista to a tarsus. (iii) Ectopic overexpression of ANTP, Labial (LAB), Deformed (DFD), SCR, Ultrabithorax (UBX), Abdominal-A (ABD-A), or Abdominal-B (ABD-B), using the dppGAL4 driver, resulted in arista-to-tarsus transformations, and repressed HTH/Extradenticle (EXD) activity noncell autonomously in early 3rd stadium antennal imaginal discs. SCR may not be the HOX protein required for normal tarsus determination, because co-ectopic expression of Proboscipedia (PB) inhibited the arista-to-tarsus transformations induced by ectopic expression of DFD, SCR, ANTP, UBX, ABD-A, and ABD-B. The proposal that SCR is the HOX protein required for normal tarsus determination is dependent on SCR being the sole target of PB suppression, which is not the case.

Genetic variation for dorsal-ventral patterning of the Drosophila melanogaster eggshell,15733305,10.1111/j.1525-142X.2005.05009.x,"Patterning of the insect eggshell is an excellent system for exploring the molecular basis of phenotypic variation. In Drosophila melanogaster, two dorsal-anterior respiratory appendages are produced in response to signaling through the Epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr). Previous work implicates Egfr pathway function in both intraspecific variation for dorsal appendage spacing (DAS) on the eggshell, as well as interspecific differences in dorsal appendage number and location. To test the hypothesis that genetic variation in Egfr contributes to variation in eggshell patterning, we have made use of naturally occurring intraspecific variation for DAS as a model quantitative trait. We found that there is substantial segregating genetic variation for DAS in D. melanogaster, and have tested for associations with 289 common polymorphisms in the Egfr locus. A marginal association was seen with two polymorphic sites in Egfr; however, we failed to replicate these findings in a second population, or in a modified quantitative complementation test designed to specifically test the effects of the putative polymorphisms. Therefore, we conclude that the polymorphisms we have identified in Egfr do not contribute to variation in DAS, and further work is required to understand the genetic architecture of this trait.",2005,"Lisa M Goering, Greg Gibson, Lisa M Goering, Greg Gibson"
Regulation of aversion to noxious food by Drosophila neuropeptide Y- and insulin-like systems,16172603,10.1038/nn1540,"Omnivores, including humans, have an inborn tendency to avoid noxious or unfamiliar foods. Such defensive foraging behaviors are modifiable, however, in response to physiological needs. Here we describe a method for assessing risk-sensitive food acquisition in Drosophila melanogaster. Food-deprived fly larvae become more likely to feed on noxious foods (adulterated with quinine) as the duration of deprivation increases. The neuropeptide F receptor NPFR1, a mammalian neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor homolog, centrally regulates the response to noxious food in D. melanogaster. Overexpression of NPFR1 was sufficient to cause nondeprived larvae to more readily take in noxious food, whereas loss of NPFR1 signaling led to the opposite phenotype. Moreover, NPFR1 neuronal activity may be directly regulated by the insulin-like signaling pathway. Upregulation of insulin-like receptor signaling in NPFR1 cells suppressed the feeding response to noxious food. Our results suggest that the coordinated activities of the conserved NPY- and insulin-like receptor signaling systems are essential for the dynamic regulation of noxious food intake according to the animal's energy state.",2005,"Qi Wu, Zhangwu Zhao, Ping Shen, Qi Wu, Zhangwu Zhao, Ping Shen"

The kinesinlike protein Subito contributes to central spindle assembly and organization of the meiotic spindle in Drosophila oocytes,16055508,10.1091/mbc.e04-11-0964,"In the oocytes of many species, bipolar spindles form in the absence of centrosomes. Drosophila melanogaster oocyte chromosomes have a major role in nucleating microtubules, which precedes the bundling and assembly of these microtubules into a bipolar spindle. Here we present evidence that a region similar to the anaphase central spindle functions to organize acentrosomal spindles. Subito mutants are characterized by the formation of tripolar or monopolar spindles and nondisjunction of homologous chromosomes at meiosis I. Subito encodes a kinesinlike protein and associates with the meiotic central spindle, consistent with its classification in the Kinesin 6/MKLP1 family. This class of proteins is known to be required for cytokinesis, but our results suggest a new function in spindle formation. The meiotic central spindle appears during prometaphase and includes passenger complex proteins such as AurB and Incenp. Unlike mitotic cells, the passenger proteins do not associate with centromeres before anaphase. In the absence of Subito, central spindle formation is defective and AurB and Incenp fail to properly localize. We propose that Subito is required for establishing and/or maintaining the central spindle in Drosophila oocytes, and this substitutes for the role of centrosomes in organizing the bipolar spindle.",2005,"J K Jang, T Rahman, K S McKim, J K Jang, T Rahman, K S McKim"
"mus309 mutation, defective in DNA double-strand break repair, affects intergenic but not intragenic meiotic recombination in Drosophila melanogaster",16454858,10.1017/S0016672305007883,"The effect was investigated of the hypomorphic DNA double-strand break repair, notably synthesis-dependent strand annealing, deficient mutation mus309 on the third chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster on intergenic and intragenic meiotic recombination in the X chromosome. The results showed that the mutation significantly increases the frequency of intergenic crossing over in two of three gene intervals of the X chromosome studied. Interestingly the increase was most prevalent in the tip of the X chromosome where crossovers normally are least frequent per physical map unit length. In particular crossing over interference was also affected, indicating that the effect of the mus309 mutation involves preconditions of crossing over but not the event of crossing over itself. On the other hand, the results also show that most probably the mutation does not have any effect on intragenic recombination, i.e. gene conversion. These results are fully consistent with the present molecular models of meiotic crossing over initiated by double-strand breaks of DNA followed by formation of a single-end-invasion intermediate, or D-loop, which is subsequently processed to generate either crossover or non-crossover products involving formation of a double Holliday junction. In particular the results suggest that the mus309 gene is involved in resolution of the D-loop, thereby affecting the choice between double-strand-break repair (DSBR) and synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) pathways of meiotic recombination.",2005,"Petter Portin, Petter Portin"

The actions of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid were examined. Replacement of the region loop B to the N-terminus of the alpha4 subunit by the corresponding region of the Dalpha2 subunit had little effect on the concentration-response curve for imidacloprid. However, replacement of Glu219 by proline in the YXCC motif in loop C of the chimeric alpha4 subunit resulted in a marked displacement to the left of the concentration-response curve for imidacloprid not seen when an equivalent mutation was made in the alpha4beta2 nAChR.

Combined evidence annotation of transposable elements in genome sequences,16110336,10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010022,"Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile, repetitive sequences that make up significant fractions of metazoan genomes. Despite their near ubiquity and importance in genome and chromosome biology, most efforts to annotate TEs in genome sequences rely on the results of a single computational program, RepeatMasker. In contrast, recent advances in gene annotation indicate that high-quality gene models can be produced from combining multiple independent sources of computational evidence. To elevate the quality of TE annotations to a level comparable to that of gene models, we have developed a combined evidence-model TE annotation pipeline, analogous to systems used for gene annotation, by integrating results from multiple homology-based and de novo TE identification methods. As proof of principle, we have annotated ""TE models"" in Drosophila melanogaster Release 4 genomic sequences using the combined computational evidence derived from RepeatMasker, BLASTER, TBLASTX, all-by-all BLASTN, RECON, TE-HMM and the previous Release 3.1 annotation. Our system is designed for use with the Apollo genome annotation tool, allowing automatic results to be curated manually to produce reliable annotations. The euchromatic TE fraction of D. melanogaster is now estimated at 5.3% (cf. 3.86% in Release 3.1), and we found a substantially higher number of TEs (n = 6,013) than previously identified (n = 1,572). Most of the new TEs derive from small fragments of a few hundred nucleotides long and highly abundant families not previously annotated (e.g., INE-1). We also estimated that 518 TE copies (8.6%) are inserted into at least one other TE, forming a nest of elements. The pipeline allows rapid and thorough annotation of even the most complex TE models, including highly deleted and/or nested elements such as those often found in heterochromatic sequences. Our pipeline can be easily adapted to other genome sequences, such as those of the D. melanogaster heterochromatin or other species in the genus Drosophila.",2005,"Hadi Quesneville, Casey M Bergman, Olivier Andrieu, Delphine Autard, Danielle Nouaud, Michael Ashburner, Dominique Anxolabehere, Hadi Quesneville, Casey M Bergman, Olivier Andrieu, Delphine Autard, Danielle Nouaud, Michael Ashburner, Dominique Anxolabehere"
Mental retardation genes in drosophila: New approaches to understanding and treating developmental brain disorders,16240406,10.1002/mrdd.20083,"Drosophila melanogaster is emerging as a valuable genetic model system for the study of mental retardation (MR).

Lifelong heterogeneity in fecundity is insufficient to explain late-life fecundity plateaus in Drosophila melanogaster,16085380,10.1016/j.exger.2005.06.006,"Previous studies have demonstrated that fecundity, like mortality, plateaus at late ages in cohorts of Drosophila melanogaster. Although evolutionary theory can explain the decline and plateau in cohort fecundity at late ages, it is conceivable that lifelong heterogeneity in individual female fecundity is producing these plateaus. For example, consistently more fecund females may die at earlier ages, leaving only females that always laid a low number of eggs preponderant at later ages. We simulated fecundity within a cohort, assuming the two phenotypes described above, and tested these predictions by measuring age of death and age-specific fecundity for individual females from three large cohorts. We statistically tested whether there was enough lifelong heterogeneity in fecundity to produce a late-life plateau by testing whether early female fecundity could predict whether that female would live to lay eggs after the onset of the population fecundity plateau. Our results indicate that heterogeneity in fecundity is not lifelong and thus not likely to cause late-life fecundity plateaus. Because lifelong heterogeneity models for fecundity are based on the same underlying assumptions as heterogeneity models for late-life mortality rates, our test of this hypothesis is also an experimental test of lifelong heterogeneity models of late life generally.",2005,"Casandra L Rauser, Yasmine Abdel-Aal, Jonathan A Shieh, Christine W Suen, Laurence D Mueller, Michael R Rose, Casandra L Rauser, Yasmine Abdel-Aal, Jonathan A Shieh, Christine W Suen, Laurence D Mueller, Michael R Rose"

Polymorphisms and fixations were categorized as A/T to G/C or G/C to A/T changes and were polarized by inferring the ancestral state using both parsimony and maximum likelihood. Noncoding fixations in both D. melanogaster and D. simulans were consistent with equilibrium base-composition evolution. However, polarized noncoding polymorphisms, revealed a different pattern. Although A/T to G/C and G/C to A/T polymorphisms in D. simulans were consistent with equilibrium, we observed a highly significant dearth of A/T to G/C polymorphisms in D. melanogaster introns but not in intergenic sequences. Such data could be explained by recent evolution of mutational biases associated with transcription or by lineage-specific selection on base composition.

Calorie restriction delays lipid oxidative damage in Drosophila melanogaster,16026335,10.1111/j.1474-9726.2005.00159.x,"The oxidative stress hypothesis predicts that the accumulation of oxidative damage to a variety of macromolecules is the molecular trigger driving the process of aging. Although an inverse relationship between oxidative damage and lifespan has been established in several different species, the precise relationship between oxidative damage and aging is not fully understood. Drosophila melanogaster is a favored model organism for aging research. Environmental interventions such as ambient temperature and calorie restriction can alter adult lifespan to provide an excellent system to examine the relationship between oxidative damage, aging and lifespan. We have developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using commercially available reagents for measuring 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) in proteins, a marker for oxidative damage to lipids, and present data in flies to show that HNE adducts accumulate in an age-dependent manner. With immunohistology, we also find the primary site of HNE accumulation is the pericerebral fat body, where induction of dFOXO was recently shown to retard aging. When subjected to environmental interventions that shorten lifespan, such as elevated ambient temperature, the chronological accumulation of HNE adduct is accelerated. Conversely, interventions that extend lifespan, such as lower ambient temperature or low calorie diets, slow the accumulation of HNE adduct. These studies associate damage from lipid peroxidation with aging and lifespan in Drosophila and show that calorie restriction in flies, as in mammals, slows the accumulation of lipid related oxidative damage.",2005,"Jianyu Zheng, Raye Mutcherson 2nd, Stephen L Helfand, Jianyu Zheng, Raye Mutcherson 2nd, Stephen L Helfand"

In order to test whether this protein acts as transcription termination factor, we assayed the capacity of DmTTF to arrest in vitro the transcription catalyzed by mitochondrial and bacteriophage RNA polymerases. Experiments with human S-100 extracts showed that DmTTF is able to arrest the transcription catalyzed by human mitochondrial RNA polymerase bidirectionally, independently of the orientation of the protein-DNA complex. On the contrary when T3 or T7 RNA polymerases were used, we found that DmTTF prevalently arrests transcription when the DNA-binding site was placed in the reverse orientation with respect to the incoming enzymes.

Developmental expression and biophysical characterization of a Drosophila melanogaster aquaporin,15800049,10.1152/ajpcell.00612.2004,"Aquaporins (AQPs) accelerate the movement of water and other solutes across biological membranes, yet the molecular mechanisms of each AQP's transport function and the diverse physiological roles played by AQP family members are still being defined. We therefore have characterized an AQP in a model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, which is amenable to genetic manipulation and developmental analysis. To study the mechanism of Drosophila Malpighian tubule (MT)-facilitated water transport, we identified seven putative AQPs in the Drosophila genome and found that one of these, previously named DRIP, has the greatest sequence similarity to those vertebrate AQPs that exhibit the highest rates of water transport. In situ mRNA analyses showed that DRIP is expressed in both embryonic and adult MTs, as well as in other tissues in which fluid transport is essential. In addition, the pattern of DRIP expression was dynamic. To define DRIP-mediated water transport, the protein was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and in yeast secretory vesicles, and we found that significantly elevated rates of water transport correlated with DRIP expression. Moreover, the activation energy required for water transport in DRIP-expressing secretory vesicles was 4.9 kcal/mol. This low value is characteristic of AQP-mediated water transport, whereas the value in control vesicles was 16.4 kcal/mol. In contrast, glycerol, urea, ammonia, and proton transport were unaffected by DRIP expression, suggesting that DRIP is a highly selective water-specific channel. This result is consistent with the homology between DRIP and mammalian water-specific AQPs. Together, these data establish Drosophila as a new model system with which to investigate AQP function.",2005,"Nancy Kaufmann, John C Mathai, Warren G Hill, Julian A T Dow, Mark L Zeidel, Jeffrey L Brodsky, Nancy Kaufmann, John C Mathai, Warren G Hill, Julian A T Dow, Mark L Zeidel, Jeffrey L Brodsky"
The inhibitor kappaB-ortholog Cactus is necessary for normal neuromuscular function in Drosophila melanogaster,15975723,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.04.046,"The Drosophila inhibitor-kappaB ortholog Cactus acts as an inhibitor of the Rel-transcription factors Dorsal and Dif. In blastoderm cells and immune competent cells, Cactus inhibits Dorsal and Dif by preventing their nuclear localization. Cactus, Dorsal and Dif are also expressed in somatic muscles, where Cactus and Dorsal, but not Dif, are enriched at the neuromuscular junction. Mutations in dorsal cause neuromuscular defects and mislocalization of Cactus. Here, we investigated whether mutations in cactus affect the neuromuscular system and subcellular localization of Dorsal and Dif. Using locomotion assays, as well as physiological and immunochemical methods, we found that wild type Cactus is necessary for the normal function of the larval neuromuscular system. The phenotype comprises i) altered bouton numbers and impaired neurotransmitter release in the neuromuscular junctions in the abdominal segments, ii) muscular weakness and iii) poor locomotion performance, probably reflecting a general neuromuscular impairment. Interestingly, in cactus mutants the subcellular localization of Dorsal and Dif in muscle is not affected, whereas cactus protein is not detected in the nucleus. This suggests, together with the similarities between the phenotypes induced by cactus and dorsal mutations, that in larval muscles the function of Cactus might be cooperation to the transcriptional activity of Rel proteins more than their cytoplasmic retention. The similarities with inhibitor-kappaB/nuclear factor kappaB interactions and muscle pathology in mammals point to Drosophila as a suitable experimental system to clarify the complex interactions of these proteins in muscle postembryonic development and activity.",2005,"A Beramendi, S Peron, A Megighian, C Reggiani, R Cantera, A Beramendi, S Peron, A Megighian, C Reggiani, R Cantera"
Production and N-glycan analysis of secreted human erythropoietin glycoprotein in stably transfected Drosophila S2 cells,16025538,10.1002/bit.20605,"Schneider 2 (S2) cells from Drosophila melanogaster have been used as a plasmid-based, non-lytic expression system for foreign proteins. Here, a plasmid encoding the human erythropoietin (hEPO) gene fused with a hexahistidine (His(6)) tag under the control of the Drosophila metallothionein (MT) promoter was stably transfected into Drosophila S2 cells. After copper sulfate induction, transfected S2 cells were found to secrete hEPO with a maximum expression level of 18 mg/L and a secretion efficiency near 98%. The secreted hEPO from Drosophila S2 had an apparent molecular weight of about 23-27 kDa which was significantly lower than a recombinant hEPO expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (about 36 kDa). N-glycosidase F digestion almost completely eliminated the difference and resulted in the same molecular weight ( approximately 20 kDa) of de-N-glycosylated hEPO proteins. These data suggest that recombinant hEPO from S2 cells was modified with smaller N-glycans. Subsequently, the major N-glycans were identified following glycoamidase A digestion, labeling with 2-aminopyridine (PA), and two-dimensional high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis in concert with exoglycosidase digestion. This analysis of N-glycans revealed that hEPO was modified to include paucimannosidic glycans containing two or three mannose residues with or without core fucose. A similar glycosylation pattern was observed on a recombinant human transferrin expressed in S2 cells.

The starvation lines showed correlated patterns found in other D. melanogaster populations selected for this trait, including higher lipid levels and increased resistance to desiccation, although the selected lines did not show a longer development time as found in some other studies. Consistent with the trade-off hypothesis, selected lines with increased starvation resistance showed decreased resistance to a cold stress as measured by mortality, whereas selected lines with increased cold resistance showed a decrease in starvation resistance. To counter the possibility of inadvertent selection accounting for these patterns, selected and control lines from both selection regimes were crossed to form mass bred populations, which were left for four generations prior to establishing isofemale lines. By scoring starvation and cold resistance in these lines derived from both sets of selection regimes, we confirmed the negative association between resistance to these stresses in females but not in males.

However, D. melanogaster and D. biarmipes have rescheduled their various life history traits to avoid interspecific competition. Differences of ranks tests for various life history traits suggest that except for DT(egg-pupa), the difference of ranks is highest for the combination of D. melanogaster and D. ananassae for all other life history traits.

Strikingly, the dramatic loss of acetylation of the K9 and K14 lysine residues of histone H3 in dGcn5 mutants has no noticeable effect on larval tissues. In contrast, strong cell proliferation defects in imaginal tissues are observed. In vivo complementation experiments revealed that dGcn5 integrates specific functions in addition to chromosome binding and acetylation. Surprisingly, a dGcn5 variant protein with a deletion of the bromodomain, which has been shown to recognize acetylated histones, appears to be fully functional.

Eugenol and safrole produced a positive recombinagenic response only in the improved assay, which was related to a high CYP450-dependent activation capacity.

Evolution of the chromosomal location of rDNA genes in two Drosophila species subgroups: ananassae and melanogaster,15726113,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800612,"The evolution of the chromosomal location of ribosomal RNA gene clusters and the organization of heterochromatin in the Drosophila melanogaster group were investigated using fluorescence in situ hybridization and DAPI staining to mitotic chromosomes.

This pattern, which is conserved throughout the melanogaster subgroup, except in D. simulans and D. sechellia, was observed only in the ercepeae complex within the ananassae subgroup. Both sex-linked NORs must have been lost in the lineage leading to D. varians and in the ananassae and bipectinata complexes, whereas new sites, characterized by intra-species variation in hybridization signal size, appeared on the fourth chromosome related to heterochromatic rearrangements. Nucleolar material is thought to be required for sex chromosome pairing and disjunction in a variety of organisms including Drosophila.

Functional analyses of tiptop and antennapedia in the embryonic development of Oncopeltus fasciatus suggests an evolutionary pathway from ground state to insect legs,15563520,10.1242/dev.01561,"In insects, selector genes are thought to modify the development of a default, or 'ground state', appendage into a tagma-specific appendage such as a mouthpart, antenna or leg. In the best described example, Drosophila melanogaster, the primary determination of leg identity is thought to result from regulatory interactions between the Hox genes and the antennal-specifying gene homothorax. Based on RNA-interference, a functional analysis of the selector gene tiptop and the Hox gene Antennapedia in Oncopeltus fasciatus embryogenesis is presented. It is shown that, in O. fasciatus, tiptop is required for the segmentation of distal leg segments and is required to specify the identity of the leg. The distal portions of legs with reduced tiptop develop like antennae. Thus, tiptop can act as a regulatory switch that chooses between antennal and leg identity. By contrast, Antennapedia does not act as a switch between leg and antennal identity. This observation suggests a significant difference in the mechanism of leg specification between O. fasciatus and D. melanogaster. These observations also suggest a significant plasticity in the mechanism of leg specification during insect evolution that is greater than would have been expected based on strictly morphological or molecular comparisons. Finally, it is proposed that a tiptop-like activity is a likely component of an ancestral leg specification mechanism. Incorporating a tiptop-like activity into a model of the leg-specification mechanism explains several mutant phenotypes, previously described in D. melanogaster, and suggests a mechanism for the evolution of legs from a ground state.",2005,"Scott W Herke, Nahum V Serio, Bryan T Rogers, Scott W Herke, Nahum V Serio, Bryan T Rogers"

Drosophila is a good model for the search of genes that are young enough to allow deciphering the molecular details of their evolutionary history.

      Using molecular genetics and the annotated Drosophila melanogaster genome, we identified CG14251 as the Drosophila paternal effect gene, ms(3)K81 (K81). This assignment was subsequently confirmed by P-element rescue of K81. A search for orthologous K81 sequences revealed that the distribution of K81 is surprisingly restricted to the 9 species comprising the melanogaster subgroup. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that K81 arose through duplication, most likely retroposition, of a ubiquitously expressed gene before the radiation of the melanogaster subgroup, followed by a period of rapid divergence and acquisition of a critical male germline-specific function.

Nuclear receptors--a perspective from Drosophila,15803199,10.1038/nrg1581,"Nuclear receptors are ancient ligand-regulated transcription factors that control key metabolic and developmental pathways. The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster has only 18 nuclear-receptor genes - far fewer than any other genetic model organism and representing all 6 subfamilies of vertebrate receptors. These unique attributes establish the fly as an ideal system for studying the regulation and function of nuclear receptors during development. Here, we review recent breakthroughs in our understanding of D. melanogaster nuclear receptors, and interpret these results in light of findings from their evolutionarily conserved vertebrate homologues.",2005,"Kirst King-Jones, Carl S Thummel"

Two functional but noncomplementing Drosophila tyrosine decarboxylase genes: distinct roles for neural tyramine and octopamine in female fertility,15691831,10.1074/jbc.M414197200,"The trace biogenic amine tyramine is present in the nervous systems of animals ranging in complexity from nematodes to mammals. Tyramine is synthesized from tyrosine by the enzyme tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC), a member of the aromatic amino acid family, but this enzyme has not been identified in Drosophila or in higher animals. To further clarify the roles of tyramine and its metabolite octopamine, we have cloned two TDC genes from Drosophila melanogaster, dTdc1 and dTdc2. Although both gene products have TDC activity in vivo, dTdc1 is expressed nonneurally, whereas dTdc2 is expressed neurally. Flies with a mutation in dTdc2 lack neural tyramine and octopamine and are female sterile due to egg retention. Although other Drosophila mutants that lack octopamine retain eggs completely within the ovaries, dTdc2 mutants release eggs into the oviducts but are unable to deposit them. This specific sterility phenotype can be partially rescued by driving the expression of dTdc2 in a dTdc2-specific pattern, whereas driving the expression of dTdc1 in the same pattern results in a complete rescue. The disparity in rescue efficiencies between the ectopically expressed Tdc genes may reflect the differential activities of these gene products. The egg retention phenotype of the dTdc2 mutant and the phenotypes associated with ectopic dTdc expression contribute to a model in which octopamine and tyramine have distinct and separable neural activities.",2005,"Shannon H Cole, Ginger E Carney, Colleen A McClung, Stacey S Willard, Barbara J Taylor, Jay Hirsh, Shannon H Cole, Ginger E Carney, Colleen A McClung, Stacey S Willard, Barbara J Taylor, Jay Hirsh"
"Identification and characterization of the fibrinogen-like domain of fibrinogen-related proteins in the mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, and the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, genomes",16150145,10.1186/1471-2164-6-114,"Background:
      
    

    
      The fibrinogen-like (FBG) domain, which consists of approximately 200 amino acid residues, has high sequence similarity to the C-terminal halves of fibrinogen beta and gamma chains. Fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs), which contain FBG domains in their C-terminal region, are found universally in vertebrates and invertebrates. In invertebrates, FREPs are involved in immune responses and other aspects of physiology. To understand the complexity of this family in insects, we analyzed FREPs in the mosquito genome and made comparisons to FREPs in the fruitfly genome.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      By using the genome data of the mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, 53 FREPs were identified, whereas only 20 members were found in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Using sequence profile analysis, we found that FBG domains have high sequence similarity and are highly conserved throughout the FBG domain region. By secondary structure analysis and comparison, the FBG domains of FREPs are predicted to function in recognition of carbohydrates and their derivatives on the surface of microorganisms in innate immunity.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Detailed sequence and structural analysis discloses that the FREP family contains FBG domains that have high sequence similarity in the A. gambiae genome. Expansion of the FREP family in mosquitoes during evolutionary history is mainly accounted for by a major expansion of the FBG domain architecture. The characterization of the FBG domains in the FREP family is likely to aid in the experimental analysis of the ability of mosquitoes to recognize parasites in innate immunity and physiologies associated with blood feeding.",2005,"Xinguo Wang, Qin Zhao, Bruce M Christensen, Xinguo Wang, Qin Zhao, Bruce M Christensen"
Fixation of transposable elements in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,16174338,10.1017/S0016672305007548,"We have investigated at the molecular level four cases in which D. melanogaster middle repetitive DNA probes consistently hybridized to a particular band on chromosomes sampled from a D. melanogaster natural population. Two corresponded to true fixations of a roo and a Stalker element, and the others were artefacts of the in situ hybridization technique caused by the presence of genomic DNA flanking the transposable elements (TEs) in the probes. The two fixed elements are located in the beta-heterochromatin (20A and 80B, respectively) and are embedded in large clusters of other elements, many of which may also be fixed. We also found evidence that this accumulation is an ongoing process. These results support the hypothesis that TEs accumulate in the non-recombining part of the genome. Their implications for the effects of TEs on determining the chromatin structure of the host genomes are discussed in the light of recent evidence for the role of TE-derived small interfering-RNAs as cis -acting determinants of heterochromatin formation.",2005,"Xulio Maside, Stavroula Assimacopoulos, Brian Charlesworth, Xulio Maside, Stavroula Assimacopoulos, Brian Charlesworth"
[The ecdysoneless1 gene regulates metabolism of the juvenile hormone and dopamine in Drosophila melanogaster],16358715,,"The dopamine (DA) content and the level of juvenile hormone (JH) degradation were studied in females of the wild-type Canton S strain and the ecdysoneless1 (ecd1) mutant, which does not produce ecdysone at a restrictive temperature (29 degrees C). Exposure at the restrictive temperature considerably increased the JH-hydrolyzing activity and the DA content in five-day ecd1 females compared with flies of both strains growing at 19 degrees C and Canton S females exposed at 29 degrees C. In one-day ecd1 females, the level of JH degradation also increased at the restrictive temperature, but the DA content was low. The effect of ecdysone deficiency on the stress response in Drosophila melanogaster females was studied using changes in DA content and JH degradation were used as indices. The ecd1 mutation did not prevent the initiation of the stress response in females exposed at the restrictive temperature, but changed its intensity (stress reactivity).

Remating in Drosophila melanogaster: an examination of the trading-up and intrinsic male-quality hypotheses,16135127,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2005.00918.x,"Female Drosophila melanogaster remate more frequently than necessary to ensure fertilization. We tested whether polyandrous females gain genetic benefits for their offspring by (1) selecting secondary sires of higher genetic-quality than original partners or (2) because post-copulatory mechanisms bias fertilizations towards genetically superior males. We screened 119 hemiclones of males for lifetime fitness then selected eight hemiclones (four of extreme high fitness and four of extreme low fitness) and mated them to virgin females. Females were then given the opportunity to remate with males of benchmark-genetic quality and their propensity to remate (fidelity) and sperm displacement scored. A female's fidelity and her level of sperm displacement varied depending on which hemiclone she mated first, but not on male-genetic quality. These findings indicate that female remating and sperm displacement are strongly influenced by male genotype, but provide no evidence that these traits contribute to adaptive female choice to obtain superior genes for offspring.",2005,"P G Byrne, W R Rice, P G Byrne, W R Rice"
"Mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel gene family in Drosophila melanogaster: complex patterns of evolution, genomic organization, and developmental expression",15886041,10.1016/j.ymgme.2005.03.009,"Voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs), also known as mitochondrial porins, are a family of small pore-forming proteins of the mitochondrial outer membrane found in all eukaryotes. VDACs play important roles in the regulated flux of metabolites between the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments, energy metabolism, and apoptosis. Annotation of the genome sequence of Drosophila melanogaster revealed three genes (CG17137, CG31722-A, and CG31722-B) with homology to porin, the previously described Drosophila VDAC. Molecular analysis reveals a complex pattern of organization and expression. The genomic organization of these four genes and sequence comparisons with other insect VDAC homologs indicate that this gene family evolved through a mechanism of duplication and divergence from an ancestral VDAC gene during the radiation of the genus Drosophila. CG17137, CG31722-A, and CG31722-B are expressed in a male-specific pattern on both transcriptional and translational levels, while porin is equally expressed in both male and female flies. Additionally, CG31722-A and CG31722-B are expressed as a dicistronic transcript. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy confirm that these proteins localize to the mitochondrion. Further expression analysis showed that CG17137 and CG31722-B are abundant in testes, while porin is ubiquitously expressed. While porin, CG17137, and CG31722-B are expressed to different degrees during embryogenesis, all of these proteins are dramatically reduced relative to cytochrome c content during larvogenesis. These studies illustrate a complex genomic organization and spatiotemporal pattern of expression for Drosophila VDACs as well as an evolutionary history consistent with either a partitioning of VDAC functions or an acquisition of novel functions among isoforms.",2005,"Brett H Graham, William J Craigen, Brett H Graham, William J Craigen"
Characterization of salicylate uptake across the basolateral membrane of the malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster,16934829,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2006.05.013,"The organic anion salicylate is a plant secondary metabolite that can protect plants against herbivores. Transport of salicylate across the basolateral membrane of the Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster was studied using a radioisotope tracer technique. The uptake of [(14)C]salicylate by the Malpighian tubules was active, saturable and Na(+)-dependent; the maximum uptake rate (J(max)) and the half saturation concentration (K(t)) were 12.6 pmoltubule(-1)min(-1) and 30.7micromoll(-1), respectively. In contrast to organic anion transport by vertebrate renal tissues, salicylate uptake was not trans-stimulated by glutarate (0.01-1.0 mmoll(-1)) or cis-inhibited by high concentrations (5 mmoll(-1)) of various alpha-keto acids (glutaric acid, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, succinic acid, and citric acid). Changes in basolateral membrane potential or physiologically relevant changes in bathing saline pH did not affect the rate of [(14)C]salicylate uptake. Ring-structure monocarboxylic acids (benzoic acid, nicotinic acid, gentisic acid, unlabelled salicylic acid, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, probenecid, fluorescein, and P-aminohippuric acid) strongly inhibited [(14)C]salicylate uptake rate. In contrast, short-chain monocarboxylic acids had little (butyric acid) or no effect (lactic acid, pyruvic acid, and propionic acid).

An approach for the identification of microRNA with an application to Anopheles gambiae,16770443,,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of 20-27 nt long noncoding RNAs, involved in post-transcriptional regulation of genes in eukaryotes. These miRNAs are usually highly conserved between the genomes of related organisms and their pre-miRNA transcript, about 60-120 nt long, forms extended stem-loop structure. Keeping these facts in mind miRsearch is developed which relies on searching the homologues of all known miRNAs of one organism in the genome of a related organism allowing few mismatches depending on the phylogenetic distance between them, followed by assessing for the capability of formation of stem-loop structure. The precursor sequences so obtained were then screened through the RNA folding program MFOLD selecting the cut-off values on the basis of known Drosophila melanogaster pre-miRNAs. With this approach, about 91 probable candidate miRNAs along with pre-miRNAs were identified in Anopheles gambiae using known D. melanogaster miRNAs.

Cobinamide, the penultimate compound in cobalamin biosynthesis, binds cyanide with about 10(10) greater affinity than cobalamin, and we found it was several-fold more effective than cobalamin in (i) reversing cyanide inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation in mammalian cells; (ii) rescuing mammalian cells and Drosophila melanogaster from cyanide toxicity; and (iii) reducing cyanide inhibition of Drosophila Malpighian tubule secretion. Cobinamide could be delivered by oral ingestion, inhalation, or injection to Drosophila, and it was as effective when administered up to 5 mins post-cyanide exposure as when given pre-exposure.

Older empirical methods are giving way to newer technologies that include bioinformatics, structural biology, genetics, and modern computational approaches. In the search for new medical therapies, and in particular treatments for disorders of the central nervous system, there has been increasing recognition that identification of a single biological target is unlikely to be a recipe for success; a broad perspective is required. Systems biology is one such approach, and has been increasingly recognized as a very important area of research, as it places specific molecular targets within a context of overall biochemical action. Understanding the complex interactions between the components within a given biological system that lead to modifications in output, such as changes in behavior or development, may be important avenues of discovery to identify new therapies. One avenue to drug discovery that holds tremendous potential is the use of model genetic organisms such as the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.

We then determined whether the change over time in any parameters is predictive of mean life span or time of onset of aging. We observed a schedule of aging-related changes. Time of onset of aging was negatively correlated with decline in desiccation resistance and with decline in K(+) between days 0 and 15, and was positively correlated with decline in Ca(2+) between days 15 and 24.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that specific ribosomal proteins are associated with chromatin in a histone H1-dependent manner. Overexpression of either histone H1 or ribosomal protein L22 in Drosophila cells resulted in global suppression of the same set of genes, while depletion of H1 and L22 caused up-regulation of tested genes, suggesting that H1 and ribosomal proteins are essential for transcriptional gene repression.

We also profiled cells depleted of the miRNA-processing enzyme Drosha. The results reveal that transcripts differentially expressed in Drosha-depleted cells have highly correlated expression in the AGO1 knockdown and are significantly enriched in predicted and validated miRNA targets.

Estimates of heritability based on the lines artificially selected for increased flight ability ranged from 0.024 to 0.052, while estimates of heritability based on the lines selected for the inability to fly after heat stress varied between 0.035 and 0.091. Reciprocal F1 crosses among these lines revealed strong additive effects of one or more autosomes and a weaker X-chromosome effect. This variation apparently affected flight specifically; neither survival to a more extreme stress nor knockdown by high temperature changed between lines selected for high and low heat tolerance as measured by flight ability.

Moreover, to evaluate the effect of clock gene products on mating activities, we examined the mating activity of D. melanogaster timeless (tim01) transgenic fly harboring heat-shock promotor driven-D. ananassae timeless (tim) gene (hs-AT tim01).
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Flies were maintained under light/dark (LD) cycles for several days and then they were transferred to constant dark (DD) conditions at 25 degrees C. Transformant flies were heat-shocked for 30 min (PZT 10.5-11.0 or PZT 22.5-23.0; PZT means Projected Zeitgeber Time) at 37 degrees C every day. Daily expressions of D. ananassae TIMELESS (TIM) protein in transgenic flies were measured by western blotting. To examine whether the timing of D. ananassae TIM protein induction by heat shock can change the patterns of the behavior activities of D. melanogaster tim01 flies, we measured locomotor and mating activity rhythms under DD at 25 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C except when heat shock was applied.

The locomotor rhythm of these flies was changed from diurnal to nocturnal by the timing of D. ananassae TIM induction. However, the mating rhythm of these flies could not be entrained by the timing of D. ananassae TIM induction.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The pattern of mating activity rhythms of D. ananassae and of D. melanogaster differed. The mating activity rhythms of D. melanogaster tim01 flies harboring hs-AT tim appeared after heat-shock but the pattern and phase differed from those of wild-type D. ananassae and D. melanogaster. Moreover, the mating rhythm of these flies could not be entrained by the timing of D. ananassae TIM induction although the locomotor rhythm of hs-AT tim01 was changed from diurnal to nocturnal according to the timing of D. ananassae TIM induction. These data suggest that species-specific mating activities require output pathways different from those responsible for locomotor rhythms.",2006,"Izumi Nishinokubi, Masami Shimoda, Norio Ishida, Izumi Nishinokubi, Masami Shimoda, Norio Ishida"
"Molecular phylogeny of the antiangiogenic and neurotrophic serpin, pigment epithelium derived factor in vertebrates",17020603,10.1186/1471-2164-7-248,"Background:
      
    

    
      Pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF), a member of the serpin family, regulates cell proliferation, promotes survival of neurons, and blocks growth of new blood vessels in mammals. Defining the molecular phylogeny of PEDF by bioinformatic analysis is one approach to understanding the link between its gene structure and its function in these biological processes.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      From a comprehensive search of available DNA databases we identified a single PEDF gene in all vertebrate species examined. These included four mammalian and six non-mammalian vertebrate species in which PEDF had not previously been described. A five gene cluster around PEDF was found in an approximate 100 kb region in mammals, birds, and amphibians. In ray-finned fish these genes are scattered over three chromosomes although only one PEDF gene was consistently found. The PEDF gene is absent in invertebrates including Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster), Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), and sea squirt (C. intestinalis). The PEDF gene is transcribed in all vertebrate phyla, suggesting it is biologically active throughout vertebrate evolution. The multiple actions of PEDF are likely conserved in evolution since it has the same gene structure across phyla, although the size of the gene ranges from 48.3 kb in X. tropicalis to 2.9 kb in fugu, with human PEDF at a size of 15.6 kb. A strong similarity in the proximal 200 bp of the PEDF promoter in mammals suggests the existence of a possible regulatory region across phyla. Using a non-synonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio we show that mammalian and fish PEDFs have similar ratios of <0.13, reflecting a strong purifying selection of PEDF gene. A large number of repetitive transposable elements of the SINE and LINE class were found with random distribution in both the promoter and introns of mammalian PEDF.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The PEDF gene first appears in vertebrates and our studies suggest that the regulation and biological actions of this gene are preserved across vertebrates. This comprehensive analysis of the PEDF gene across phyla provides new information that will aid further characterization of common functional motifs of this serpin in biological processes.",2006,"Xuming Xu, Samuel Shao-Min Zhang, Colin J Barnstable, Joyce Tombran-Tink, Xuming Xu, Samuel Shao-Min Zhang, Colin J Barnstable, Joyce Tombran-Tink"
A recombinational portrait of the Drosophila pseudoobscura genome,16545148,10.1017/S0016672306007932,"Drosophila pseudoobscura has been intensively studied by evolutionary biologists for over 70 years. The recent publication of the genome sequence not only permits studies of comparative genomics with other dipterans but also opens the door to identifying genes associated with adaptive traits or speciation or testing for the signature of natural selection across the genome. Information on regional rates of recombination, localization of inversion breakpoints distinguishing it from its sibling species D. persimilis, and known polymorphic markers may be useful in such studies. Here, we present a molecular linkage map of four of the five major chromosome arms of D. pseudoobscura. In doing so, we order and orient several sequence contig groups, localize the inversion breakpoints on chromosome 2 to intervals of 200 kilobases, and identify one error in the published sequence assembly. Our results show that regional recombination rates in D. pseudoobscura are much higher than in D. melanogaster and significantly higher even than in D. persimilis. Furthermore, we detect a non-significant positive correlation between recombination rate and published DNA sequence variation. Finally, the online Appendix presents 200 primer sequence pairs for molecular markers that can be used for mapping of quantitative trait loci, of which 125 are known to be polymorphic within or between species.",2006,"Daniel Ortiz-Barrientos, Audrey S Chang, Mohamed A F Noor, Daniel Ortiz-Barrientos, Audrey S Chang, Mohamed A F Noor"
Stabilization of a native protein mediated by ligand binding inhibits amyloid formation independently of the aggregation pathway,17004719,10.1021/jm0606488,"The acylphosphatases from Sulfolobus solfataricus and Drosophila melanogaster (Sso AcP and AcPDro2) were previously shown to form amyloid-like aggregates without the need to unfold initially. Inorganic phosphate (Pi), a competitive inhibitor binding specifically to the active site of these proteins, was found to stabilize, upon binding, the native state of AcPDro2 and to inhibit its conversion into amyloid-like fibrils. The inhibitory effect of Pi is suppressed only in a variant in which the Arg residue responsible for Pi binding is mutated. The study on Sso AcP shows that Pi retards both the formation of the initial nativelike oligomers and their subsequent conversion into protofibrils. Thus, stabilization of the native structure mediated by specific binding with small molecules can be an effective therapeutic strategy against protein deposition diseases that originate from initially folded proteins, independently of the structure of the protein, its aggregation pathway, and the particular aggregated species responsible for pathogenesis.",2006,"Gemma Soldi, Georgia Plakoutsi, Niccolo Taddei, Fabrizio Chiti, Gemma Soldi, Georgia Plakoutsi, Niccolo Taddei, Fabrizio Chiti"
Specification of auditory sensitivity by Drosophila TRP channels,16819519,10.1038/nn1735,"Ears achieve their exquisite sensitivity by means of mechanical feedback: motile mechanosensory cells through their active motion boost the mechanical input from the ear. Examination of the auditory mechanics in Drosophila melanogaster mutants shows that the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel NompC is required to promote this feedback, whereas the TRP vanilloid (TRPV) channels Nan and Iav serve to control the feedback gain.

CG15031/PPYR1 is an intrinsically unstructured protein that interacts with protein phosphatase Y,16631104,10.1016/j.abb.2006.03.020,"Protein phosphatase Y (PPY) is a Drosophila testis-specific enzyme of unknown function. In a yeast two-hybrid screen we identified CG15031/PPYR1 as a PPY interacting protein. The specificity of the protein-protein interaction was proven by directed two-hybrid tests. The complex formation between PPY and PPYR1 was confirmed under in vitro and in vivo conditions by plasmon resonance spectroscopy, co-immunoprecipitation, and pull down experiments. Recombinant PPYR1 expressed in Escherichia coli is a heatstable, protease sensitive, intrinsically unstructured RNA-binding protein that migrates anomalously in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It can be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro. PPYR1 moderately inhibits PPY activity, the inhibitory potential of the protein is slightly increased by phosphorylation.

Genotoxicity of vesicular fluid and saline extract of Taenia solium metacestodes in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,16395698,10.1002/em.20194,"Neurocysticercosis, the most common parasitic disease of the central nervous system, is caused by cysticerci of the helminth Taenia solium, which is prevalent in developing countries and is reemerging in affluent societies. This helminth is associated with brain tumors and hematological malignancies in humans. In the present study, we analyzed the genotoxicity of vesicular fluid (VF) and a saline extract (SE) of T. solium metacestodes in the Drosophila melanogaster wing somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART). Third-instar larvae derived from standard and high bioactivation crosses were treated for approximately 48 hr with 12.5, 25.0, and 50.0 microg/ml of VF and SE of T. solium metacestodes. Negative (phosphate buffered saline) and positive (10 mM urethane) controls were also included. The results showed that the two test compounds were genotoxic in both crosses of Drosophila.

GC-biased segregation of noncoding polymorphisms in Drosophila,16157668,10.1534/genetics.105.046524,"The study of base composition evolution in Drosophila has been achieved mostly through the analysis of coding sequences. Third codon position GC content, however, is influenced by both neutral forces (e.g., mutation bias) and natural selection for codon usage optimization. In this article, large data sets of noncoding DNA sequence polymorphism in D. melanogaster and D. simulans were gathered from public databases to try to disentangle these two factors-noncoding sequences are not affected by selection for codon usage. Allele frequency analyses revealed an asymmetric pattern of AT vs. GC noncoding polymorphisms: AT --> GC mutations are less numerous, and tend to segregate at a higher frequency, than GC --> AT ones, especially at GC-rich loci. This is indicative of nonstationary evolution of base composition and/or of GC-biased allele transmission. Fitting population genetics models to the allele frequency spectra confirmed this result and favored the hypothesis of a biased transmission. These results, together with previous reports, suggest that GC-biased gene conversion has influenced base composition evolution in Drosophila and explain the correlation between intron and exon GC content.",2006,"Nicolas Galtier, Eric Bazin, Nicolas Bierne, Nicolas Galtier, Eric Bazin, Nicolas Bierne"
A dual function for Deep orange in programmed autophagy in the Drosophila melanogaster fat body,16600212,10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.03.002,"Lysosomal degradation of cytoplasm by way of autophagy is essential for cellular amino acid homeostasis and for tissue remodeling. In insects such as Drosophila, autophagy is developmentally upregulated in the larval fat body prior to metamorphosis. Here, autophagy is induced by the hormone ecdysone through down-regulation of the autophagy-suppressive phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. In yeast, Vps18 and other members of the HOPS complex have been found essential for autophagic degradation. In Drosophila, the Vps18 homologue Deep orange (Dor) has previously been shown to mediate fusion of multivesicular endosomes with lysosomes. A requirement of Dor for ecdysone-mediated chromosome puffing has also been reported. In the present report, we have tested the hypothesis that Dor may control programmed autophagy at the level of ecdysone signaling as well as by mediating autophagosome-to-lysosome fusion. We show that dor mutants are defective in programmed autophagy and provide evidence that autophagy is blocked at two levels. First, PI3K activity was not down-regulated correctly in dor larvae, which correlated with a decrease in ecdysone reporter activity. The down-regulation of PI3K activity was restored by feeding ecdysone to the mutant larvae. Second, neither exogenous ecdysone nor overexpression of PTEN, a silencer of PI3K signaling, restored fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes in the fat body of dor mutants. These results indicate that Dor controls autophagy indirectly, via ecdysone signaling, as well as directly, via autolysosomal fusion.",2006,"Karine Lindmo, Anne Simonsen, Andreas Brech, Kim Finley, Tor Erik Rusten, Harald Stenmark, Karine Lindmo, Anne Simonsen, Andreas Brech, Kim Finley, Tor Erik Rusten, Harald Stenmark"
DNA underreplication in intercalary heterochromatin regions in polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster correlates with the formation of partial chromosomal aberrations and ectopic pairing,16583218,10.1007/s00412-006-0063-7,"We studied the influence of the Suppressor of Underreplication (SuUR) gene expression on the intercalary heterochromatin (IH) regions of Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes. We observed a strong positive correlation between increased SuUR expression, underreplication extent, amount of DNA truncation, and formation of ectopic contacts in IH regions. SuUR overexpression from heat shock-driven transgene results in the formation of partial chromosomal aberrations whose breakpoints map exclusively to the regions of intercalary and pericentric heterochromatin. It is important to note that all these effects are seen only if SuUR overexpression is induced during early stages of chromosome polytenization. Therefore, we developed the idea that ectopic pairing results from the joining of free DNA ends, which are formed as a consequence of underreplication.",2006,"Elena S Belyaeva, Sergey A Demakov, Galina V Pokholkova, Artyom A Alekseyenko, Tatiana D Kolesnikova, Igor F Zhimulev, Elena S Belyaeva, Sergey A Demakov, Galina V Pokholkova, Artyom A Alekseyenko, Tatiana D Kolesnikova, Igor F Zhimulev"
Olfactory conditioning of proboscis activity in Drosophila melanogaster,16964495,10.1007/s00359-006-0160-3,"Olfactory learning and memory processes in Drosophila have been well investigated with aversive conditioning, but appetitive conditioning has rarely been documented. Here, we report for the first time individual olfactory conditioning of proboscis activity in restrained Drosophila melanogaster. The protocol was adapted from those developed for proboscis extension conditioning in the honeybee Apis mellifera. After establishing a scale of small proboscis movements necessary to characterize responses to olfactory stimulation, we applied Pavlovian conditioning, with five trials consisting of paired presentation of a banana odour and a sucrose reward. Drosophila showed conditioned proboscis activity to the odour, with a twofold increase of percentage of responses after the first trial. No change occurred in flies experiencing unpaired presentations of the stimuli, confirming an associative basis for this form of olfactory learning. The adenylyl cyclase mutant rutabaga did not exhibit learning in this paradigm. This protocol generated at least a short-term memory of 15 min, but no significant associative memory was detected at 1 h. We also showed that learning performance was dependent on food motivation, by comparing flies subjected to different starvation regimes.",2006,"Marie-Ange Chabaud, Jean-Marc Devaud, Minh-H?

Chromatin structure and transcription of the R1- and R2-inserted rRNA genes of Drosophila melanogaster,17000772,10.1128/MCB.01409-06,"About half of the rRNA gene units (rDNA units) of Drosophila melanogaster are inserted by the retrotransposable elements R1 and R2. Because transcripts to R1 and R2 were difficult to detect on blots and electron microscopic observations of rRNA synthesis suggested that only uninserted rDNA units were transcribed, it has long been postulated that inserted rDNA units are in a repressed (inactive) chromatin structure. Studies described here suggest that inserted and uninserted units are equally accessible to DNase I and micrococcal nuclease and contain similar levels of histone H3 and H4 acetylation and H3K9 methylation. These studies have low sensitivity, because psoralen cross-linking suggested few (estimated <10%) of the rDNA units of any type are transcriptionally active. Nuclear run-on experiments revealed that R1-inserted and R2-inserted units are activated for transcription at about 1/5 and 1/10, respectively, the rate of uninserted units. Most transcription complexes of the inserted units terminate within the elements, thus explaining why previous molecular and electron microscopic methods indicated inserted units are seldom transcribed. The accumulating data suggest that all units within small regions of the rDNA loci are activated for transcription, with most control over R1 and R2 activity involving steps downstream of transcription initiation.",2006,"Junqiang Ye, Thomas H Eickbush, Junqiang Ye, Thomas H Eickbush"

Sequence and genomic structure of ras homologues Dmras85D and Dmras64B of Drosophila melanogaster,3110012,10.1016/0378-1119(87)90301-5,"The ras homologues of Drosophila melanogaster located at 85D and 64B on the polytene chromosome map were cloned using the Ha-ras gene of Harvey murine sarcoma virus as a probe.

Dmras85D is much more similar to the Ha-ras, Ki-ras, and N-ras genes than it is to either the Dmras64B gene or to the ras genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Comparison of the Dmras85D genomic sequences with the previously published nucleotide sequence (Neuman-Silberberg et al., Cell 37 (1984) 1027-1033) shows that the positions of the two introns are not conserved relative to the positions of the introns in Dmras64B or in vertebrate ras genes. The Dmras64B and Dmras85D transcripts were analyzed by blot hybridization and shown to be dissimilar. The data suggest that the divergence of the Dmras genes was ancient, and that Dmras85D and Dmras64B have different functions.",1987,"H W Brock, H W Brock"

The images produced by inelastically scattered electrons at specific ionization edges were compared, and the non-specific background signals were subtracted by an image processing system. The presence of Ca2+, antimony and oxygen in the precipitates formed could be demonstrated. The elemental composition of the precipitates and of yolk spheres was also analysed by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). With respect to the precipitates, signals at the calcium L2,3-edge, the oxygen K-edge and the antimony M4,5-edge were recorded without deconvolution and background subtraction.

Organ-specific patterns of gene expression in the reproductive tract of Drosophila are regulated by the sex-determination genes,1907583,10.1016/0012-1606(91)90246-y,"The sex-determination genes of Drosophila act to repress the developmental pathway for the internal somatic reproductive organs of the opposite sex. By misregulating this pathway during preadult development, the organ-specific expression pattern of the glucose dehydrogenase gene (Gld) in the reproductive tract of adult flies has been changed without a concomitant sexual transformation of the reproductive organs. Misregulation of the tra, tra-2, and dsx genes leads to very similar patterns of ectopic expression of Gld. The induced ectopic patterns of Gld expression at the adult stage occur in a small subset of organs which all normally express the Gld gene during their morphogenesis. These ectopic patterns are irrevocably set during late larval-early pupal development. The normal pattern of Gld expression in several other Drosophila species is quite similar to the ectopic patterns which we have generated in D. melanogaster, suggesting that the interspecific variation in Gld expression may result from variation in the expression of the sex-determination genes.",1991,"Y Feng, N M Schiff, D R Cavener, Y Feng, N M Schiff, D R Cavener"
Further study on selective transmission of mitochondrial DNA in heteroplasmic lines of Drosophila melanogaster,1777252,10.1266/jjg.66.609,"The temperature-dependent transmission of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was investigated in heteroplasmic lines of Drosophila melanogaster established by germ-plasm transplantation. Using D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. mauritiana as germ-plasm donors, five recipient-donor combinations of heteroplasmy, differing from those previously examined (Matsuura et al., 1991), were constructed. For intraspecific reciprocal combinations, donor mtDNA in one combination was retained at 25 degrees C but was almost lost by the tenth generation at 19 degrees C. In the reciprocal, the proportion of the same type of recipient mtDNA decreased more quickly at 19 degrees C than 25 degrees C. Decreasing rates at 19 degrees C in the reciprocals differed from each other. For interspecific combinations, two species were used as germ-plasm donors. Donor mtDNA derived from D. simulans was lost at both temperatures and the rate of decrease was greater at 19 degrees C than 25 degrees C. The proportion of donor mtDNA derived from D. mauritiana increased at a greater rate at 25 degrees C than 19 degrees C when using two different strains of D. melanogaster as recipients.

Expression of heat-shock locus hsr-omega in nonstressed cells during development in Drosophila melanogaster,1704862,10.1016/0012-1606(91)90479-m,"The hsr-omega locus forms one of the largest Drosophila heat-shock puffs and produces three major transcripts. These three transcripts are also produced constitutively, at lower levels, in almost all tissues and developmental stages. The amounts of the transcripts in nonstressed cells are modulated during development. The hormone ecdysone leads to increased levels of hsr-omega transcripts in cultured cells, suggesting that changing ecdysone titers may play a role in the developmental changes of hsr-omega transcript levels. By in situ hybridization to RNA in tissue sections, we detect only two cell types that lack hsr-omega transcripts--the preblastoderm embryo and the primary spermatocyte. There are no maternal transcripts of hsr-omega in the embryo. Transcripts appear abruptly at the time that the zygotic genome becomes transcriptionally active, shortly before the formation of the cellular blastoderm. No constitutive hsr-omega transcripts are found in primary spermatocytes. The spermatocytes cannot respond to heat shock by transcribing either hsr-omega or hsp70 RNA. Constitutive hsr-omega transcription is resumed later in spermatogenesis and hsr-omega RNA is detected in differentiating spermatids.

Reassessment of the effect of biological rhythm mutations on learning in Drosophila melanogaster,1795234,10.1007/BF00194897,"A link between learning deficits and circadian period-lengthening mutations in Drosophila melanogaster previously has been reported. Mutant long-period males performed poorly in two learning assays involving experience-dependent courtship inhibition. In one, normal males that have courted fertilized females subsequently show courtship inhibition with virgin females. In the other, normal males that have courted sexually immature males subsequently fail to court other immature males. Those results have been reassessed in an extended study of genetic variants involving the period gene. 1. Long-period perL1 males demonstrated poor conditioned courtship inhibition when exposed to fertilized females; they showed normal courtship conditioning when exposed to immature males. This could be due to a perL1-associated olfactory deficit with fertilized females, since perL1 males were unable to discriminate behaviorally between fertilized and virgin females. 2. Other long-period males, including perL2 males and transgenic perL1 males bearing a truncated form of the per+ gene, were conditioned normally by fertilized females. Thus, the courtship inhibition defect is specific to the perL1 mutant strain. 3. perL1 (and other per mutant) flies showed normal acquisition and retention of a classically conditioned olfactory avoidance response. 4. Results from a new conditioned courtship inhibition experiment are presented; males exposed to fertilized females during training showed further courtship inhibition during subsequent exposure to fertilized females. From the perspective of learning theory, this can be viewed as a savings experiment.",1991,"D A Gailey, A Villella, T Tully, D A Gailey, A Villella, T Tully"
Cytoplasmic incompatibility in Drosophila populations: influence of assortative mating on symbiont distribution,1787328,10.1016/0022-2011(91)90190-2,Cytoplasmic incompatibility is known to occur between strains of both Drosophila simulans and D. melanogaster. Incompatibility is associated with the infection of Drosophila with microorganismal endosymbionts. This paper reports survey work conducted on strains of D. simulans and D. melanogaster from diverse geographical locations finding that infected populations are relatively rare and scattered in their distribution. The distribution of infected populations of D. simulans appears to be at odds with deterministic models predicting the rapid spread of the infection through uninfected populations. Examination of isofemale lines from four localities in California where populations appear to be polymorphic for the infection failed to find evidence for consistent assortative mating preferences between infected and uninfected populations that may explain the basis for the observed polymorphism.,1991,"S L O'Neill, S L O'Neill"

A functional and structural analysis of the Sex combs reduced locus of Drosophila melanogaster,1743486,,"We have undertaken a developmental genetic analysis of the homeotic gene Sex combs reduced (Scr) of Drosophila melanogaster by examining embryonic and adult phenotypes of mutations affecting Scr gene function. Molecular mapping of Scr breakpoint lesions has defined a segment of greater than 70 kb of DNA necessary for proper Scr gene function. This region is split by the fushi tarazu (ftz) gene, with lesions affecting embryonic Scr function molecularly mapping to the region proximal (5') to ftz and those exhibiting polyphasic semilethality predominantly mapping distal (3') to ftz. Gain-of-function mutations are associated with genomic rearrangements and map throughout the Scr locus. Our analysis has revealed that the Scr locus encompasses genetic elements that are responsible for functions in both the embryonic and larval to adult periods of development. From these studies, we conclude that Scr is a complex genetic locus with an extensive regulatory region that directs functions required for normal head and thoracic development in both the embryo and the adult and that the regulation of Scr during these two periods is distinct.",1991,"A M Pattatucci, D C Otteson, T C Kaufman, A M Pattatucci, D C Otteson, T C Kaufman"

Dosage compensation of a retina-specific gene in Drosophila miranda,1706975,10.1007/BF00418246,"The X1R chromosome of Drosophila miranda and the 3L autosome of Drosophila melanogaster are thought to have originated from the ancestral D chromosomal element and therefore may contain the same set of genes. It is expected that these genes will be dosage compensated in D. miranda because of their X linkage. To test these possibilities and to study evolution of the dosage compensation mechanism, we used the 3L-linked autosomal head-specific gene 507 ml of D. melanogaster to isolate the homologous gene (507mr) from a D. miranda genomic library. In situ hybridization showed that gene 507 is located at the 12A region of the X1R chromosome of D. miranda, indicating that the chromosomal homology deduced by cytogenetic means is correct. Restriction analysis and cross-specific DNA and RNA blot hybridization revealed the presence of extensive restriction pattern polymorphism and lack of sequence similarity in some areas of the 507mr and 507 ml DNA, including the 3' portion of the transcribed region. However, the 5' portion of the transcribed region and the DNA sequences, located approximately 0.8 kb upstream and 3 kb downstream from the 507 ml gene showed a high degree of similarity with the DNA sequences of comparable regions of the 507mr gene. In both species gene 507 codes for a highly abundant 1.8 kb RNA which is expressed in the retina of the compound eye. Although in D. miranda the males have one and the females have two copies of the 507 gene, the steady-state levels of the 507 mRNA in both sexes were found to be similar, indicating that gene 507 is dosage compensated in D. miranda.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1991,"R Krishnan, K D Swanson, R Ganguly, R Krishnan, K D Swanson, R Ganguly"
Identification of the genes coding for the second-largest subunits of RNA polymerases I and III of Drosophila melanogaster,1910149,10.1007/BF00260636,"We have isolated cDNA and genomic clones of Drosophila melanogaster by cross-hybridization with a 658 bp fragment of the yeast gene coding for the second-largest subunit of RNA polymerase III (RET1). Determination of the sequence by comparison of genomic and cDNA regions reveals an ORF of 3405 nucleotides which is interrupted in the genomic sequence by an intron of 48 bp. The deduced polypeptide consists of 1135 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 128 kDa. The protein sequence shows the same conserved regions of homology as those observed for all the second-largest subunits of RNA polymerases cloned so far. The gene (DmRP128) obviously codes for a second-largest subunit of an RNA polymerase which is different from DmRP140 and DmRP135. We have purified three distinct RNA polymerase activities from D. melanogaster. By using specific RNA polymerase inhibitors in enzyme assays and by comparing their subunit composition we were able to distinguish between RNA polymerase I, II, and III. RNA polymerase preparations of D. melanogaster were blotted and the second-largest subunits were identified with antibodies raised against polypeptides expressed from DmRP128 and DmRP135. Anti-DmRP135 antibodies react strongly with the second-largest subunit of RNA polymerase I but do not react with the respective subunits of RNA polymerase II and III. The second-largest subunit of RNA polymerase III is only recognized by anti-DmRP128.

Genetic control and expression of the major ejaculatory bulb protein (PEB-me) in Drosophila melanogaster,1772395,10.1007/BF00590103,"PEB-me is a predominant protein of mature Drosophila melanogaster ejaculatory bulbs. It is resolved into four or five closely spaced subfractions (apparent molecular weight 35-39 kD) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Four electrophoretic variants of PEB-me differing in apparent molecular weight by 200-800 daltons were found. These appear to be controlled by four alleles of a gene (peb) located by recombination and deletion mapping to the 60F1-2 region of chromosome 2. A minor ejaculatory bulb protein of ca. 80 kD (hPEB) was found to be immunochemically related to PEB and possibly encoded by peb. PEB is not detected by immunoblotting techniques in virgin females, in male tissues other than the ejaculatory bulb, or during developmental stages preceding the formation of this organ. The results of transplantations of genital imaginal discs and of immature ejaculatory bulbs between two strains having different PEB alleles suggest that the ejaculatory bulb is the site of PEB synthesis. In flies mutant for tra, tra-2, dsx, or ix, tissue specificity of PEB localization is retained and the protein is found whenever the ejaculatory bulb is formed, regardless of the chromosomal sex of the fly. The protein is transferred into the female genital duct during mating, where it can be detected for up to 12 hr.

Circadian fluctuations in per mRNA levels are thought to contribute to circadian fluctuations in per protein levels in the heads of adult flies. To address the mechanisms underlying these oscillatory phenomena, we have analyzed RNA and protein cycling from two per-beta-galactosidase fusion genes. These studies demonstrate that 5' noncoding sequences from per are sufficient to cause the fusion mRNA levels to cycle in a wild-type (rhythmic) background.

Tandemly repeating peptide motifs and their secondary structure in Ceratitis capitata eggshell proteins Ccs36 and Ccs38,1801905,10.1016/0141-8130(91)90032-p,"Evidence from amino acid composition, Fourier transform analysis of primary structure and secondary structure prediction suggests a tripartite structure for Ceratitis capitata eggshell proteins Ccs36 and Ccs38, which consists of a central domain and two flanking 'arms'. The proteins, apparently, contain tandemly repeating peptide motifs specific for each domain of the tripartite structure. The central domain of both proteins, which exhibits extensive sequence homology with the corresponding domains of Drosophila melanogaster proteins s36 and s38, is formed by tandem repeats of an octapeptide-X-X-X-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z- (where X = large hydrophobic residue and Z = beta-turn former residue) and its variants. It is predicted to adopt a compact, most probably twisted, antiparallel beta-pleated sheet structure of beta-sheet strands regularly alternating with beta-turns or loops. The central domains of Ccs36 and Ccs38 share structural similarities, but they are recognizably different. The 'arms' of the proteins presumably serving for protein and species-specific functions differ substantially from those of Drosophila melanogaster. In Ccs36, the C-terminal 'arm' is formed by, almost precise, tandem repeats of an octapeptide-Y-X-A-A-P-A-A-S- (X = G or S), whereas the N-terminal 'arm' contains repeats of the octapeptide -Z-Z-Z-A-X-A-A-Z- (X = Q, N or E and Z a beta-turn former).

Regulation of juvenile hormone synthesis in wild-type and apterous mutant Drosophila,1797586,10.1016/0303-7207(91)90219-i,"Juvenile hormone (JH) is a major regulator of insect development and reproduction and its titer is determined largely by central nervous system regulation of JH synthesis by the corpora allata. To establish the basis for a molecular genetic dissection of the neuroendocrine system responsible for modulating JH titer, a radiochemical assay was utilized to examine JH synthesis in vitro by the isolated corpus allatum as well as the regulation of this synthesis by brain extracts of wild-type and apterous mutant Drosophila melanogaster females during reproductive maturation. JH production by glands of wild-type females increases in parallel with the progress of ovarian maturation, the major product of the adult corpus allatum being juvenile hormone 3 bis-epoxide (JHB3). Gland activity appears to be regulated by both the availability of JH precursors and the level of terminal oxidase(s) in the JH biosynthetic pathway. The brain contains an allatostatic factor, that is transmitted to the glands via nervous connections. Allatostatin production in the brain appears to be positively regulated by JHB3. Adult corpora allata from the mutants ap4 and ap56f synthesize very low levels of JH; additionally, brains of ap56f homozygotes lack allatostatic activity.",1991,"M Altaratz, S W Applebaum, D S Richard, L I Gilbert, D Segal, M Altaratz, S W Applebaum, D S Richard, L I Gilbert, D Segal"

The temporal variant exhibits a reduction in enzyme levels in all larval tissues and in the adult abdomen, while levels of activity in the adult thorax are equal to the control line. Isozymic analyses of these tissues demonstrate that it is the GPDH-3 species that is reduced in a temporal and tissue-specific manner. In contrast, the systemic variant demonstrates a uniform reduction of all isozymic species in each tissue and developmental stage.

There is no significant male x female interaction with respect or progeny viability; but the interaction is significant for productivity, i.e. when fertility and viability are jointly taken into account. There is overdominance with respect to female fertility, but not with respect to male fertility or to viability.

In DT40, immunoglobulin genes undergo regulated sequence diversification by gene conversion templated by pseudogene donors. We found that the immunoglobulin Vlambda pseudogene array is characterized by histone modifications associated with active chromatin. We directly demonstrated the importance of chromatin structure for gene conversion, using a regulatable experimental system in which the heterochromatin protein HP1 (Drosophila melanogaster Su[var]205), expressed as a fusion to Escherichia coli lactose repressor, is tethered to polymerized lactose operators integrated within the pseudo-Vlambda donor array. Tethered HP1 diminished histone acetylation within the pseudo-Vlambda array, and altered the outcome of Vlambda diversification, so that nontemplated mutations rather than templated mutations predominated. Thus, chromatin structure regulates homology-directed repair.

Ras-like small GTPases form a large family of proteins in the marine sponge Suberites domuncula,17334709,10.1007/s00239-006-0081-3,"Sponges (Porifera) are the simplest and the most ancient metazoan animals, which branched off first from the common ancestor of all multicellular animals. We have inspected approximately 13,000 partial cDNA sequences (ESTs) from the marine sponge Suberites domuncula and have identified full or partial cDNA sequences coding for approximately 50 different Ras-like small GTPases. Forty-four sponge proteins from the Ras family are described here: 6 proteins from the Ras subfamily, 5 from Rho, 6 from Arf, 1 Ran, and 26 Rabs or Rab-like proteins. No isoforms of these proteins were detected; the closest related proteins are two Rho proteins with 74% identity. Small GTPases from sponge display a higher degree of sequence conservation with orthologues from vertebrates (53%-93% identity) than with those from either Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila melanogaster. The real number of small GTPases in this sponge is certainly much higher than 50, because the actual S. domuncula database of approximately 13,000 ESTs contains at most 3000 nonredundant cDNA sequences.

Identification and analysis of cabut orthologs in invertebrates and vertebrates,17333257,10.1007/s00427-007-0144-5,"Cabut (cbt) is a Drosophila melanogaster gene involved in epidermal dorsal closure (DC). Its expression is dependent on the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade, and it functions downstream of Jun regulating dpp expression in the leading edge cells. The Cbt protein contains three C(2)H(2)-type zinc fingers and a serine-rich domain, suggesting that it functions as a transcription factor. We have identified single cbt orthologs in other Drosophila species, as well as in other insects and invertebrate organisms like ascidians and echinoderms, but not in nematodes. Gene structure and protein sequence are highly conserved among Drosophilidae, but are more diverged in the other species of invertebrates analyzed. According to this, we demonstrate that cbt expression is detected in the embryonic lateral epidermis in several Drosophila species, as it occurs in D. melanogaster, thus suggesting that the cbt orthologs may have a conserved role in these species during DC. We have also analyzed the genomes of several vertebrate species, finding that the cbt orthologous genes in these organisms encode proteins that belong to the TIEG family of Sp1-like/KrÃ¼ppel-like transcription factors. Phylogenetic analysis of the invertebrate and vertebrate proteins identified indicates that they mainly follow the expected phylogeny of the species, and that the cbt gene was duplicated during vertebrate evolution. Because we were not able to identify cbt orthologous genes neither in yeast nor in plants, our results suggest that this gene has been probably conserved throughout metazoans and that it may play a fundamental role in animal biology.",2007,"Silvia MuÃ±oz-Descalzo, Yaiza Belacortu, Nuria Paricio, Silvia MuÃ±oz-Descalzo, Yaiza Belacortu, Nuria Paricio"
The Drosophila DCO mutation suppresses age-related memory impairment without affecting lifespan,17322874,10.1038/nn1863,"The study of age-related memory impairment (AMI) has been hindered by a lack of AMI-specific mutants. In a screen for such mutants in Drosophila melanogaster, we found that heterozygous mutations of DCO (DCO/+), which encodes the major catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), delay AMI more than twofold without affecting lifespan or memory at early ages. AMI is restored when a DCO transgene is expressed in mushroom bodies, structures important for olfactory memory formation. Furthermore, increasing cAMP and PKA activity in mushroom bodies causes premature AMI, whereas reducing activity suppresses AMI. In Drosophila AMI consists of a specific reduction in memory dependent on the amnesiac (amn) gene. amn encodes putative neuropeptides that have been proposed to regulate cAMP levels in mushroom bodies. Notably, both the memory and AMI defects of amn mutants are restored in amn;DCO/+ double mutants, suggesting that AMI is caused by an age-related disruption of amn-dependent memory via PKA activity in mushroom bodies.",2007,"Daisuke Yamazaki, Junjiro Horiuchi, Yasuko Nakagami, Shintaro Nagano, Takuya Tamura, Minoru Saitoe, Daisuke Yamazaki, Junjiro Horiuchi, Yasuko Nakagami, Shintaro Nagano, Takuya Tamura, Minoru Saitoe"
Telomeric trans-silencing: an epigenetic repression combining RNA silencing and heterochromatin formation,17941712,10.1371/journal.pgen.0030158,"The study of P-element repression in Drosophila melanogaster led to the discovery of the telomeric Trans-Silencing Effect (TSE), a repression mechanism by which a transposon or a transgene inserted in subtelomeric heterochromatin (Telomeric Associated Sequence or TAS) has the capacity to repress in trans in the female germline, a homologous transposon, or transgene located in euchromatin. TSE shows variegation among egg chambers in ovaries when silencing is incomplete. Here, we report that TSE displays an epigenetic transmission through meiosis, which involves an extrachromosomal maternally transmitted factor. We show that this silencing is highly sensitive to mutations affecting both heterochromatin formation (Su(var)205 encoding Heterochromatin Protein 1 and Su(var)3-7) and the repeat-associated small interfering RNA (or rasiRNA) silencing pathway (aubergine, homeless, armitage, and piwi). In contrast, TSE is not sensitive to mutations affecting r2d2, which is involved in the small interfering RNA (or siRNA) silencing pathway, nor is it sensitive to a mutation in loquacious, which is involved in the micro RNA (or miRNA) silencing pathway. These results, taken together with the recent discovery of TAS homologous small RNAs associated to PIWI proteins, support the proposition that TSE involves a repeat-associated small interfering RNA pathway linked to heterochromatin formation, which was co-opted by the P element to establish repression of its own transposition after its recent invasion of the D. melanogaster genome.

In a T-maze choice test, the seven high-learning lines were better at avoiding an odor previously associated with aversive mechanical shock than were five unselected ""low-learning"" lines originating from the same natural population. Thus, the evolved improvement in learning ability of high-learning lines generalized to another aversion learning task involving a different aversive stimulus (shock instead of bitter taste) and a different behavioral context than that used to impose selection. In this olfactory shock task, the high-learning lines showed improvements in the learning rate as well as in two forms of consolidated memory: anesthesia-resistant memory and long-term memory. Thus, genetic variation underlying the experimental evolution of learning performance in the high-learning lines affected several phases of memory formation in the course of olfactory aversive learning. However, the two forms of consolidated memory were negatively correlated among replicate high-learning lines, which is consistent with a recent hypothesis that these two forms of consolidated memory are antagonistic.",2007,"Frederic Mery, Juliette Pont, Thomas Preat, Tadeusz J Kawecki, Frederic Mery, Juliette Pont, Thomas Preat, Tadeusz J Kawecki"

However, very little is known about p24 developmental, spatial, or sex-specific expression patterns or how localized expression affects function.

One of these genes, logjam (loj), is expressed in the adult female nervous system and ovaries and is essential for oviposition. Nervous system-specific expression of loj, but not ovary-specific expression, rescues the behavioral defect of mutants. The Loj protein localizes to punctate structures in the cellular cytoplasm. These structures colocalize with a marker specific to the intermediate compartment and cis-Golgi, consistent with experimental evidence from other systems suggesting that p24 proteins function in intracellular transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. Our findings reveal that Drosophila p24 transcripts are developmentally and tissue-specifically expressed. CG31787 is male-specifically expressed gene that is present during the larval, pupal, and adult stages. Female CG9053 mRNA is limited to the head, whereas males express this gene widely.

Comparative genomics reveals a constant rate of origination and convergent acquisition of functional retrogenes in Drosophila,17233920,10.1186/gb-2007-8-1-r11,"Background:
      
    

    
      Processed copies of genes (retrogenes) are duplicate genes that originated through the reverse-transcription of a host transcript and insertion in the genome. This type of gene duplication, as any other, could be a source of new genes and functions. Using whole genome sequence data for 12 Drosophila species, we dated the origin of 94 retroposition events that gave rise to candidate functional genes in D. melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Based on this analysis, we infer that functional retrogenes have emerged at a fairly constant rate of 0.5 genes per million years per lineage over the last approximately 63 million years of Drosophila evolution. The number of functional retrogenes and the rate at which they are recruited in the D. melanogaster lineage are of the same order of magnitude as those estimated in the human lineage, despite the higher deletion bias in the Drosophila genome. However, unlike primates, the rate of retroposition in Drosophila seems to be fairly constant and no burst of retroposition can be inferred from our analyses. In addition, our data also support an important role for retrogenes as a source of lineage-specific male functions, in agreement with previous hypotheses. Finally, we identified three cases of functional retrogenes in D. melanogaster that have been independently retroposed and recruited in parallel as new genes in other Drosophila lineages.

Larvae subjected to RNA interference-mediated (RNAi) suppression of dSet2 lack dSet2 expression and H3-K36 methylation, indicating that dSet2 is the sole enzyme responsible for this modification in Drosophila melanogaster. dSet2 RNAi blocks puparium formation and adult development, and causes partial (blister) separation of the dorsal and ventral wing epithelia, defects suggesting a failure of the ecdysone-controlled genetic program. A transheterozygous EcR null mutation/dSet2 RNAi combination produces a complete (balloon) separation of the wing surfaces, revealing a genetic interaction between EcR and dSet2.

We have developed a simple assay to measure protein binding to oligonucleosomes and used it to characterise the DF31-oligonucleosome interaction. DF31 bound to chromatin in vitro at a level comparable to that observed in vivo. The DF31-chromatin interaction required the presence of core histone tails but binding was independent of the presence of H1 in the chromatin. Multiple regions of DF31 contributed to the interaction. Df31-chromatin binding still occurred on chromatin containing only H3/4, and cross-linking experiments showed that Df31 made intimate contact with H3, suggesting that this might be the primary contact site. Finally, using immobilised chromatin templates, we showed that DF31 promoted interstrand bridging between two independent oligonucleosome chains. These results provide strong evidence for a structural role of DF31 in chromatin folding and give an indication of the mechanism involved.",2007,"Delphine Guillebault, Sue Cotterill, Delphine Guillebault, Sue Cotterill"

It is shown the reduction of life span in sterile females and an increase of life span in sterile males. The obtained results indicate that signals from male and female gonads have opposite effects on longevity. Whereas in fertile flies sexual dimorphism that manifested in greater female longevity was observed, in sterile flies females had duration of life close to males.

A Drosophila systems approach to xenobiotic metabolism,17488889,10.1152/physiolgenomics.00018.2007,"Insecticide resistance is a major problem for both medicine and agriculture and is frequently associated with overexpression of metabolic enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of pesticides, leading to broad-spectrum resistance. However, the insect tissues within which these metabolic enzymes normally reside remain unclear. Microarray analysis of nine adult tissues from Drosophila melanogaster reveals that cytochrome P-450s and glutathione-S-transferases show highly tissue-specific expression patterns; most were confined to one or more epithelial tissues, and half showed dominant expression in a single tissue. The particular detoxifying enzymes encountered by a xenobiotic thus depend critically on the route of administration. In particular, known insecticide metabolism genes are highly enriched in insect Malpighian (renal) tubules, implicating them in xenobiotic metabolism. The tubules thus display, with the fat body, roles analogous to the vertebrate liver and immune system, as well as its acknowledged renal function. To illustrate this, when levels of a single gene, Cyp6g1, were manipulated in just the Malpighian tubules of adult Drosophila, the survival of the whole insect after 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) challenge was altered, whereas corresponding manipulations in the nervous system or the fat body were without effect. This shows that, although detoxification enzymes are widely distributed, baseline protection against DDT resides primarily in the insect excretory system, corresponding to less than 0.1% of the mass of the organism.",2007,"Jingli Yang, Caroline McCart, Debra J Woods, Selim Terhzaz, Karen G Greenwood, Richard H ffrench-Constant, Julian A T Dow, Jingli Yang, Caroline McCart, Debra J Woods, Selim Terhzaz, Karen G Greenwood, Richard H ffrench-Constant, Julian A T Dow"
Analysis of two P-element enhancer-trap insertion lines that show expression in the giant fibre neuron of Drosophila melanogaster,16879616,10.1111/j.1601-183X.2006.00263.x,"The giant fibre system (GFS) of Drosophila is a simple neural circuit that mediates escape responses in adult flies. Here we report the initial characterization of two genes that are preferentially expressed in the GFS. Two P-element insertion lines, carrying the GAL4 transcriptional activator, were identified that exhibited pronounced expression in elements of the GFS and relatively low levels elsewhere within the adult central nervous system. Genomic DNA flanking the P-element insertion site was recovered from each of these lines, sequenced, and nearby transcripts identified and confirmed to exhibit GFS expression by in situ hybridization. This analysis revealed that these P-elements were in previously characterized genes. Line P[GAL4]-A307 has an insert in the gene short stop for which we have identified a novel transcript, while line P[GAL4]-141 has an insert in the transcription factor ken and barbie. Here we show that ken and barbie mutants have defects in escape behaviour, behavioural responses to visual stimuli and synaptic functions in the GFS. We have therefore revealed a neural role for a transcription factor that previously had no implicated neural function.",2007,"M J Allen, J A Drummond, D J Sweetman, K G Moffat, M J Allen, J A Drummond, D J Sweetman, K G Moffat"
Identification of N-glycosylated proteins from the central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster,17893096,10.1093/glycob/cwm097,"Although the function of many glycoproteins in the nervous system of fruit flies is well understood, information about the glycosylation profile and glycan attachment sites for such proteins is scarce. In order to fill this gap and to facilitate the analysis of N-linked glycosylation in the nervous system, we have performed an extensive survey of membrane-associated glycoproteins and their N-glycosylation sites isolated from the adult Drosophila brain. Following subcellular fractionation and trypsin digestion, we used different lectin affinity chromatography steps to isolate N-glycosylated glycopeptides. We identified a total of 205 glycoproteins carrying N-linked glycans and revealed their 307 N-glycan attachment sites. The size of the resulting dataset furthermore allowed the statistical characterization of amino acid distribution around the N-linked glycosylation sites. Glycan profiles were analyzed separately for glycopeptides that were strongly and weakly bound to Concanavalin A (Con A), or that failed to bind Concanavalin A, but did bind to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). High- or paucimannosidic glycans dominated each of the profiles, although the wheat germ agglutinin-bound glycan population was enriched in more extensively processed structures. A sialylated glycan structure was unambiguously detected in the wheat germ agglutinin-bound fraction. Despite the large amount of starting material, insufficient amount of glycopeptides was retained by the Wisteria floribunda (WFA) and Sambucus nigra columns to allow glycan or glycoprotein identification, providing further evidence that the vast majority of glycoproteins in the adult Drosophila brain carry primarily high-mannose, paucimannose, and hybrid glycans. The obtained results should facilitate future genetic and molecular approaches addressing the role of N-glycosylation in the central nervous system (CNS) of Drosophila.",2007,"Kate Koles, Jae-Min Lim, Kazuhiro Aoki, Mindy Porterfield, Michael Tiemeyer, Lance Wells, Vlad Panin, Kate Koles, Jae-Min Lim, Kazuhiro Aoki, Mindy Porterfield, Michael Tiemeyer, Lance Wells, Vlad Panin"
Analysis of Drosophila species genome size and satellite DNA content reveals significant differences among strains as well as between species,18039867,10.1534/genetics.107.075069,"The size of eukaryotic genomes can vary by several orders of magnitude, yet genome size does not correlate with the number of genes nor with the size or complexity of the organism. Although ""whole""-genome sequences, such as those now available for 12 Drosophila species, provide information about euchromatic DNA content, they cannot give an accurate estimate of genome sizes that include heterochromatin or repetitive DNA content. Moreover, genome sequences typically represent only one strain or isolate of a single species that does not reflect intraspecies variation. To more accurately estimate whole-genome DNA content and compare these estimates to newly assembled genomes, we used flow cytometry to measure the 2C genome values, relative to Drosophila melanogaster. We estimated genome sizes for the 12 sequenced Drosophila species as well as 91 different strains of 38 species of Drosophilidae. Significant differences in intra- and interspecific 2C genome values exist within the Drosophilidae. Furthermore, by measuring polyploid 16C ovarian follicle cell underreplication we estimated the amount of satellite DNA in each of these species. We found a strong correlation between genome size and amount of satellite underreplication. Addition and loss of heterochromatin satellite repeat elements appear to have made major contributions to the large differences in genome size observed in the Drosophilidae.",2007,"Giovanni Bosco, Paula Campbell, Joao T Leiva-Neto, Therese A Markow, Giovanni Bosco, Paula Campbell, Joao T Leiva-Neto, Therese A Markow"
Rapid cold-hardening protects Drosophila melanogaster from cold-induced apoptosis,17245639,10.1007/s10495-006-0048-2,"The rapid cold-hardening (RCH) response increases the cold tolerance of insects by protecting against non-freezing, cold-shock injury. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays important roles in development and the elimination of sub-lethally damaged cells. Our objectives were to determine whether apoptosis plays a role in cold-shock injury and, if so, whether the RCH response protects against cold-induced apoptosis in Drosophila melanogaster. The present study confirmed that RCH increased the cold tolerance of the adults at the organismal level. No flies in the cold-shocked group survived direct exposure to 7 degrees C for 2 h, whereas significantly more flies in the RCH group survived exposure to 7 degrees C for 2 h after a 2-h exposure to 5 degrees C. We used a TUNEL assay to detect and quantify apoptotic cell death in five groups of flies including control, cold-shocked, RCH, heat-shocked (37.5 degrees C, 30 min), and frozen (20 degrees C, 24 h) and found that apoptosis was induced by cold shock, heat shock, and freezing. The RCH treatment significantly improved cell viability by 38% compared to the cold-shocked group. Cold shock-induced DNA fragmentation shown by electrophoresis provided further evidence for apoptosis. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed an RCH-specific protein band with molecular mass of approximately 150 kDa. Western-blotting revealed three proteins that play key roles in the apoptotic pathway: caspase-9-like (apoptotic initiator), caspase-3-like (apoptotic executioner) and Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein). Consequently, the results of this study support the hypothesis that the RCH response protects against cold-shock-induced apoptosis.",2007,"Shu-Xia Yi, Clifford W Moore, Richard E Lee Jr, Shu-Xia Yi, Clifford W Moore, Richard E Lee Jr"

An increase in splice site strength has been observed in long introns in D. melanogaster. We show this is also true of C. elegans. We also examine the relationship between intron density and splice site strength. There is an increase in splice site strength as the intron structure becomes less dense. This could suggest that introns are not recognized in isolation but could function in a cooperative manner to ensure proper splicing.

Preventive role of folic acid on the developmental toxicity of phenol in Drosophila melanogaster,18717517,10.1177/0748233708090905,"Phenol (PN), obtained from coal tar, is used commonly in medical treatments, industrial areas, petroleum refineries, production of glue, fiber, and nylon.

The main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PN and PN + FA on various developmental stages of Drosophila melanogaster. Different concentrations of PN and PN + FA were administered during the developmental periods of the fly (egg, larva and pupa). When F1 progeny of control and experimental groups were compared, PN was found to extend the process of metamorphosis and decrease the total offspring numbers. However, these negative effects were inhibited by FA treatment at different concentrations (0.25-2.50 mg/kg).

Known maternal gradients are not sufficient for the establishment of gap domains in Drosophila melanogaster,17196796,10.1016/j.mod.2006.11.001,"Gap genes are among the first transcriptional targets of maternal morphogen gradients in the early Drosophila embryo. However, it remains unclear whether these gradients are indeed sufficient to establish the boundaries of localized gap gene expression patterns. In this study, we address this question using gap gene circuits, which are data-driven mathematical tools for extracting regulatory information from quantitative wild-type gene expression data. We present new, quantitative data on the mRNA expression patterns for the gap genes KrÃ¼ppel (Kr), knirps (kni) and giant (gt) during the early blastoderm stage of Drosophila development. This data set shows significant differences in timing of gap gene expression compared to previous observations, and reveals that early gap gene expression is highly variable in both space and time. Gene circuit models fit to this data set were used for a detailed regulatory analysis of early gap gene expression. Our analysis shows that the proper balance of maternal repression and activation is essential for the correct positioning of gap domains, and that such balance can only be achieved for early expression of kni. In contrast, our results suggest that early expression of gt requires local neutralization of repressive input in the anterior region of the embryo, and that known maternal gradients are completely insufficient to position the boundaries of the early central Kr domain, or in fact any Kr-like domain in the central region of the blastoderm embryo. Based on this, we propose that unknown additional regulators must be involved in early gap gene regulation.",2007,"Johannes Jaeger, David H Sharp, John Reinitz, Johannes Jaeger, David H Sharp, John Reinitz"

Ejaculate depletion patterns evolve in response to experimental manipulation of sex ratio in Drosophila melanogaster,17683443,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00157.x,"We assessed the extent to which traits related to ejaculate investment have evolved in lines of Drosophila melanogaster that had an evolutionary history of maintenance at biased sex ratios. Measures of ejaculate investment were made in males that had been maintained at male-biased (MB) and female-biased (FB) adult sex ratios, in which levels of sperm competition were high and low, respectively. Theory predicts that when the risk of sperm competition is high and mating opportunities are rare (as they are for males in the MB populations), males should increase investment in their few matings. We therefore predicted that males from the MB lines would (1) exhibit increased investment in their first mating opportunities and (2) deplete their ejaculates at a faster rate when mating multiply, in comparison to FB males. To investigate these predictions we measured the single mating productivity of males from three replicates each of MB and FB lines mated to five wild-type virgin females in succession. In contrast to the first prediction, there was no evidence for differences in productivity between MB and FB line males in their first matings. The second prediction was upheld: mates of MB and FB males suffered increasingly reduced productivity with successive matings, but the decline was significantly more pronounced for MB than for FB males. There was a significant reduction in the size of the accessory glands and testes of males from the MB and FB regimes after five successive matings. However, the accessory glands, but not testes, of MB males became depleted at a significantly faster rate than those of FB males. The results show that male reproductive traits evolved in response to the level of sperm competition and suggest that the ability to maintain fertility over successive matings is associated with the rate of ejaculate, and particularly accessory gland, depletion.",2007,"Jon R Linklater, Bregje Wertheim, Stuart Wigby, Tracey Chapman, Jon R Linklater, Bregje Wertheim, Stuart Wigby, Tracey Chapman"

Heteroduplex DNA in meiotic recombination in Drosophila mei-9 mutants,17339219,10.1534/genetics.107.070557,"Meiotic recombination gives rise to crossovers, which are required in most organisms for the faithful segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiotic cell division. Characterization of crossover-defective mutants has contributed much to our understanding of the molecular mechanism of crossover formation. We report here a molecular analysis of recombination in a Drosophila melanogaster crossover-defective mutant, mei-9. In the absence of mei-9 activity, postmeiotic segregation associated with noncrossovers occurs at the expense of crossover products, suggesting that the underlying meiotic function for MEI-9 is in crossover formation rather than mismatch repair. In support of this, analysis of the arrangement of heteroduplex DNA in the postmeiotic segregation products reveals different patterns from those observed in Drosophila Msh6 mutants, which are mismatch-repair defective. This analysis also provides evidence that the double-strand break repair model applies to meiotic recombination in Drosophila.

By genotyping parents and phenotyping offspring, we minimized genotyping costs but had the power to detect association between markers and quantitative traits. Consistent with prior studies, we found strong associations between the clinal chromosomal inversion In(3R)Payne and markers within it, as well as among these markers.

We mapped the quantitative trait loci responsible for the change in muscle fiber number between D. sechellia and D. simulans to two genomic regions on chromosome 2.

Mitochondria-mediated, caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death in the larvae exposed to 1.0 and 2.0% leachates of flashlight battery factory was concurrent with a significant regression in Hsp70 expression and a higher ROS generation. A positive correlation drawn between ROS generation and apoptotic markers and a negative correlation between apoptotic markers and Hsp70 expression in these groups indicated the important role of ROS in the leachate-induced cellular damage. Hsp70 along with antioxidant enzymes offered protection to the organisms exposed to all the tested concentrations of the leachates of pigment plant waste and 0.5% leachate of flashlight battery factory in a cooperative manner when ROS generation was less induced. Conversely, higher levels of ROS generation in the organisms treated with 1.0 and 2.0% leachate of flashlight battery factory after 24 and 48 h resulted in regression of Hsp70 expression in them leading to cell death. The study suggests that (1) leachates of flashlight battery factory waste more adversely affected the organisms in comparison to the leachates of pigment plant waste.

Adherens junction remodeling by the Notch pathway in Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis,17420294,10.1083/jcb.200609079,"Identifying genes involved in the control of adherens junction (AJ) remodeling is essential to understanding epithelial morphogenesis. During follicular epithelium development in Drosophila melanogaster, the main body follicular cells (MBFCs) are displaced toward the oocyte and become columnar. Concomitantly, the stretched cells (StCs) become squamous and flatten around the nurse cells. By monitoring the expression of epithelial cadherin and Armadillo, I have discovered that the rate of AJ disassembly between the StCs is affected in follicles with somatic clones mutant for fringe or Delta and Serrate. This results in abnormal StC flattening and delayed MBFC displacement. Additionally, accumulation of the myosin II heavy chain Zipper is delayed at the AJs that require disassembly. Together, my results demonstrate that the Notch pathway controls AJ remodeling between the StCs and that this role is crucial for the timing of MBFC displacement and StC flattening.

Analysis of the trajectory of Drosophila melanogaster in a circular open field arena,17957265,10.1371/journal.pone.0001083,"Background:
      
    

    
      Obtaining a complete phenotypic characterization of a freely moving organism is a difficult task, yet such a description is desired in many neuroethological studies. Many metrics currently used in the literature to describe locomotor and exploratory behavior are typically based on average quantities or subjectively chosen spatial and temporal thresholds. All of these measures are relatively coarse-grained in the time domain. It is advantageous, however, to employ metrics based on the entire trajectory that an organism takes while exploring its environment.
    

    
  


        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      To characterize the locomotor behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, we used a video tracking system to record the trajectory of a single fly walking in a circular open field arena. The fly was tracked for two hours. Here, we present techniques with which to analyze the motion of the fly in this paradigm, and we discuss the methods of calculation. The measures we introduce are based on spatial and temporal probability distributions and utilize the entire time-series trajectory of the fly, thus emphasizing the dynamic nature of locomotor behavior. Marginal and joint probability distributions of speed, position, segment duration, path curvature, and reorientation angle are examined and related to the observed behavior.
    

    
  


        Conclusions/significance:
      
    

    
      The measures discussed in this paper provide a detailed profile of the behavior of a single fly and highlight the interaction of the fly with the environment. Such measures may serve as useful tools in any behavioral study in which the movement of a fly is an important variable and can be incorporated easily into many setups, facilitating high-throughput phenotypic characterization.",2007,"Dan Valente, Ilan Golani, Partha P Mitra, Dan Valente, Ilan Golani, Partha P Mitra"

According to the criterion used, there is a temperature-sensitive period of spermatogenesis, which presumably coincides with meiosis. Phenotypes of some individuals correspond to the presence of two sex chromosomes of obtained from the same parent. The frequency of abnormal chromosome sets in the offspring of male carriers of the sbr10 mutation is about two times higher than in the offspring of males without this mutation.",2007,"A V K'ergaard, L A Mamon, A V K'ergaard, L A Mamon"
Transcription of the 1.688 satellite DNA family is under the control of RNA interference machinery in Drosophila melanogaster ovaries,17409066,10.1534/genetics.107.071720,"Here we show that RNA interference (RNAi) machinery operates in Drosophila melanogaster 1.688 satellite transcription. Mutation in the spn-E gene, known to be involved in RNAi in the oocytes, causes an increase of satellite transcript abundance. Transcripts of both strands of 1.688 satellite repeats in germinal tissues were detected. The strength of the effects of the spn-E mutation differs for 1.688 satellite DNA subfamilies and is more pronounced for autosomal pericentromeric satellites compared to the X-linked centromeric ones. The spn-E(1) mutation causes an increase of the H3-AcK9 mark and TAF1 (a component of the polymerase II transcriptional complex) occupancy in the chromatin of autosomal pericentromeric repeats. Thus, we revealed that RNAi operates in ovaries to maintain the silenced state of centromeric and pericentromeric 1.688 repeats.",2007,"Lev Usakin, JosÃ© Abad, Vasily V Vagin, Beatriz de Pablos, Alfredo Villasante, Vladimir A Gvozdev, Lev Usakin, JosÃ© Abad, Vasily V Vagin, Beatriz de Pablos, Alfredo Villasante, Vladimir A Gvozdev"
Wurst is essential for airway clearance and respiratory-tube size control,17558392,10.1038/ncb1611,"The Drosophila melanogaster tracheal system and the mammalian lung are branching networks of tubular epithelia that convert during late embryogenesis from liquid- to air-filling.

In wurst mutants, respiratory-tube length is increased and lumen clearance is abolished, preventing gas filling of the airways. Wurst is essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is required for size determination and lumen clearance of the airways. wurst recruits heat shock cognate protein 70-4 and clathrin to the apical membrane of epithelial cells.

"Telomeric trans-silencing in Drosophila melanogaster: tissue specificity, development and functional interactions between non-homologous telomeres",18813361,10.1371/journal.pone.0003249,"Background:
      
    

    
      The study of P element repression in Drosophila melanogaster led to the discovery of the telomeric Trans-Silencing Effect (TSE), a homology-dependent repression mechanism by which a P-transgene inserted in subtelomeric heterochromatin (Telomeric Associated Sequences, ""TAS"") has the capacity to repress in trans, in the female germline, a homologous P-lacZ transgene located in euchromatin. TSE can show variegation in ovaries, displays a maternal effect as well as an epigenetic transmission through meiosis and involves heterochromatin and RNA silencing pathways.
    

    
  


        Principal findings:
      
    

    
      Here, we analyze phenotypic and genetic properties of TSE. We report that TSE does not occur in the soma at the adult stage, but appears restricted to the female germline. It is detectable during development at the third instar larvae where it presents the same tissue specificity and maternal effect as in adults. Transgenes located in TAS at the telomeres of the main chromosomes can be silencers which in each case show the maternal effect. Silencers located at non-homologous telomeres functionally interact since they stimulate each other via the maternally-transmitted component. All germinally-expressed euchromatic transgenes tested, located on all major chromosomes, were found to be repressed by a telomeric silencer: thus we detected no TSE escaper. The presence of the euchromatic target transgene is not necessary to establish the maternal inheritance of TSE, responsible for its epigenetic behavior. A single telomeric silencer locus can simultaneously repress two P-lacZ targets located on different chromosomal arms.
    

    
  


        Conclusions and significance:
      
    

    
      Therefore TSE appears to be a widespread phenomenon which can involve different telomeres and work across the genome.

Analysis of hunger-driven gene expression in the Drosophila melanogaster larval central nervous system,18828662,10.2108/zsj.25.746,"A transposon-inserted mutant of Drosophila melanogaster was recently identified, and the larvae show no food preference (Ryuda and Hayakawa, 2005). To reveal the genetic mechanism underlying the preference change in this mutant, a large-scale oligo-DNA microarray screening was carried out to identify genes whose expression is different in control and mutant strains. We focused especially on hunger-driven changes in gene expression in the larval central nervous system (CNS) of both strains, because the state of food depletion should promote a feeding response due to changed expression of certain genes in the CNS. We identified 22 genes whose expression changed after starvation in either or both of the two strains. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses confirmed the expression changes in four genes, CG6271, CG6277, CG7953, and new glue 3 (ng3, encoding a putative structural molecule). CG6271 and CG6277 encode triacylglycerol lipase, and CG7953 produces a protein homologous to a juvenile hormone (JH) binding protein. The expression of these two groups of genes was enhanced in control strain larvae with a normal food preference but not in GS1189 strain larvae. Given that these genes contribute to mediating hunger-driven changes in food preference and intake in D. melanogaster larvae, the dysfunction of these key genes could cause the defect in food preference observed in GS1189-strain larvae.",2008,"Masasuke Ryuda, Kimio Shimada, Ryo Koyanagi, Kaoru Azumi, Teiichi Tanimura, Yoichi Hayakawa, Masasuke Ryuda, Kimio Shimada, Ryo Koyanagi, Kaoru Azumi, Teiichi Tanimura, Yoichi Hayakawa"
Autosomal variation for male body size and sperm competition phenotypes is uncorrelated in Drosophila melanogaster,18577499,10.1098/rsbl.2008.0283,"Correlations between male body size and phenotypes impacting post-copulatory sexual selection are commonly observed during the manipulation of male body size by environmental rearing conditions. Here, we control for environmental influences and test for genetic correlations between natural variation in male body size and phenotypes affecting post-copulatory sexual selection in Drosophila melanogaster. Dry weights of virgin males from 90 second-chromosome and 88 third-chromosome substitution lines were measured. Highly significant line effects (p<0.001) documented a genetic basis to variation in male body size. No significant correlations were identified between male body size and the components of sperm competitive ability. These results suggest that natural autosomal variation for male body size has little impact on post-copulatory sexual selection. If genetic correlations exist between male body size and post-copulatory sexual selection then variation in the sex chromosomes are likely candidates, as might be expected if sexually antagonistic coevolution was responsible.",2008,"Rui Zhang, Linda Amah, Anthony C Fiumera, Rui Zhang, Linda Amah, Anthony C Fiumera"
Low conservation of gene content in the Drosophila Y chromosome,19011613,10.1038/nature07463,"Chromosomal organization is sufficiently evolutionarily stable that large syntenic blocks of genes can be recognized even between species as distantly related as mammals and puffer fish (450 million years (Myr) of divergence). In Diptera, the gene content of the X chromosome and the autosomes is well conserved: in Drosophila more than 95% of the genes have remained on the same chromosome arm in the 12 sequenced species (63 Myr of divergence, traversing 400 Myr of evolution), and the same linkage groups are clearly recognizable in mosquito genomes (260 Myr of divergence). Here we investigate the conservation of Y-linked gene content among the 12 sequenced Drosophila species. We found that only a quarter of the Drosophila melanogaster Y-linked genes (3 out of 12) are Y-linked in all sequenced species, and that most of them (7 out of 12) were acquired less than 63 Myr ago. Hence, whereas the organization of other Drosophila chromosomes traces back to the common ancestor with mosquitoes, the gene content of the D. melanogaster Y chromosome is much younger. Gene losses are known to have an important role in the evolution of Y chromosomes, and we indeed found two such cases. However, the rate of gene gain in the Drosophila Y chromosomes investigated is 10.9 times higher than the rate of gene loss (95% confidence interval: 2.3-52.5), indicating a clear tendency of the Y chromosomes to increase in gene content. In contrast with the mammalian Y chromosome, gene gains have a prominent role in the evolution of the Drosophila Y chromosome.",2008,"Leonardo B Koerich, Xiaoyun Wang, Andrew G Clark, Antonio Bernardo Carvalho, Leonardo B Koerich, Xiaoyun Wang, Andrew G Clark, Antonio Bernardo Carvalho"

Kinetic response of a Drosophila melanogaster cell line to different medium formulations and culture conditions,19003169,10.1007/s10616-008-9146-z,"In the past few years, Drosophila melanogaster cells have been employed for recombinant protein production purposes, and a comprehensive knowledge of their metabolism is essential for process optimization. In this work, the kinetic response of a Schneider S2 cell line, grown in shake flasks, in two different culture media, the serum-free SF900-II((R)) and the serum-supplemented TC-100, was evaluated. Cell growth, amino acids and glucose uptake, and lactate synthesis were measured allowing the calculation of kinetic parameters. The results show that S2 cells metabolism was able to adjust to different environmental situations, as determined by medium formulation, as well as by the particular situation resulting from the culture conditions. Cells attained a 163% higher final cell concentration (1.4 x 10(7) cells mL(-1)) in SF900 II((R)) medium, when compared to serum-supplemented TC-100 medium. Also, a maximum specific cell growth rate 52% higher in SF900 II((R) )medium, when compared to serum-supplemented TC-100 one, was observed. Glutamine was the growth limiting factor in SF900 II((R)) medium, while glucose, sometimes associated with glutamine, controlled growth in serum-supplemented TC-100 medium based formulation. The different pattern of lactate production is an example of the versatility of the metabolism of these cells. This by-product was produced only in glutamine limitation, but the amount synthesized depended not only on the excess glucose, but on other medium components. Therefore, in serum-supplemented TC-100 medium a much smaller lactate amount was generated.

Definition of global and transcript-specific mRNA export pathways in metazoans,18086857,10.1101/gad.1616008,"Eukaryotic gene expression requires export of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) from their site of transcription in the nucleus to the cytoplasm where they are translated.

Here we report the results of a genome-wide RNAi screen in which we identify 72 factors required for polyadenylated [poly-(A(+))] mRNA export from the nucleus in Drosophila cells. Using structural and functional conservation analysis of yeast and Drosophila mRNA export factors, we expose the evolutionary divergence of eukaryotic mRNA export pathways. Additionally, we demonstrate the differential export requirements of two endogenous heat-inducible transcripts--intronless heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) and intron-containing HSP83--and identify novel export factors that participate in HSP83 mRNA splicing. We characterize several novel factors and demonstrate their participation in interactions with known components of the Drosophila export machinery.

"An approximate bayesian estimator suggests strong, recurrent selective sweeps in Drosophila",18802463,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000198,"The recurrent fixation of newly arising, beneficial mutations in a species reduces levels of linked neutral variability. Models positing frequent weakly beneficial substitutions or, alternatively, rare, strongly selected substitutions predict similar average effects on linked neutral variability, if the product of the rate and strength of selection is held constant. We propose an approximate Bayesian (ABC) polymorphism-based estimator that can be used to distinguish between these models, and apply it to multi-locus data from Drosophila melanogaster. We investigate the extent to which inference about the strength of selection is sensitive to assumptions about the underlying distributions of the rates of substitution and recombination, the strength of selection, heterogeneity in mutation rate, as well as the population's demographic history. We show that assuming fixed values of selection parameters in estimation leads to overestimates of the strength of selection and underestimates of the rate. We estimate parameters for an African population of D. melanogaster (? approximately 2E-03, ) and compare these to previous estimates. Finally, we show that surveying larger genomic regions is expected to lend much more discriminatory power to the approach.

Neuroarchitecture of aminergic systems in the larval ventral ganglion of Drosophila melanogaster,18365004,10.1371/journal.pone.0001848,"Biogenic amines are important signaling molecules in the central nervous system of both vertebrates and invertebrates. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, biogenic amines take part in the regulation of various vital physiological processes such as feeding, learning/memory, locomotion, sexual behavior, and sleep/arousal. Consequently, several morphological studies have analyzed the distribution of aminergic neurons in the CNS. Previous descriptions, however, did not determine the exact spatial location of aminergic neurite arborizations within the neuropil. The release sites and pre-/postsynaptic compartments of aminergic neurons also remained largely unidentified. We here used gal4-driven marker gene expression and immunocytochemistry to map presumed serotonergic (5-HT), dopaminergic, and tyraminergic/octopaminergic neurons in the thoracic and abdominal neuromeres of the Drosophila larval ventral ganglion relying on Fasciclin2-immunoreactive tracts as three-dimensional landmarks. With tyrosine hydroxylase- (TH) or tyrosine decarboxylase 2 (TDC2)-specific gal4-drivers, we also analyzed the distribution of ectopically expressed neuronal compartment markers in presumptive dopaminergic TH and tyraminergic/octopaminergic TDC2 neurons, respectively. Our results suggest that thoracic and abdominal 5-HT and TH neurons are exclusively interneurons whereas most TDC2 neurons are efferent. 5-HT and TH neurons are ideally positioned to integrate sensory information and to modulate neuronal transmission within the ventral ganglion, while most TDC2 neurons appear to act peripherally. In contrast to 5-HT neurons, TH and TDC2 neurons each comprise morphologically different neuron subsets with separated in- and output compartments in specific neuropil regions. The three-dimensional mapping of aminergic neurons now facilitates the identification of neuronal network contacts and co-localized signaling molecules, as exemplified for DOPA decarboxylase-synthesizing neurons that co-express crustacean cardioactive peptide and myoinhibiting peptides.",2008,"Matthias VÃ¶mel, Christian Wegener, Matthias VÃ¶mel, Christian Wegener"
Larval cells become imaginal cells under the control of homothorax prior to metamorphosis in the Drosophila tracheal system,18455715,10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.03.025,"In Drosophila melanogaster, one of the most derived species among holometabolous insects, undifferentiated imaginal cells that are set-aside during larval development are thought to proliferate and replace terminally differentiated larval cells to constitute adult structures. Essentially all tissues that undergo extensive proliferation and drastic morphological changes during metamorphosis are thought to derive from these imaginal cells and not from differentiated larval cells. The results of studies on metamorphosis of the Drosophila tracheal system suggested that large larval tracheal cells that are thought to be terminally differentiated may be eliminated via apoptosis and rapidly replaced by small imaginal cells that go on to form the adult tracheal system. However, the origin of the small imaginal tracheal cells has not been clear. Here, we show that large larval cells in tracheal metamere 2 (Tr2) divide and produce small imaginal cells prior to metamorphosis. In the absence of homothorax gene activity, larval cells in Tr2 become non-proliferative and small imaginal cells are not produced, indicating that homothorax is necessary for proliferation of Tr2 larval cells. These unexpected results suggest that larval cells can become imaginal cells and directly contribute to the adult tissue in the Drosophila tracheal system. During metamorphosis of less derived species of holometabolous insects, adult structures are known to be formed via cells constituting larval structures. Thus, the Drosophila tracheal system may utilize ancestral mode of metamorphosis.",2008,"Makoto Sato, Yusuke Kitada, Tetsuya Tabata, Makoto Sato, Yusuke Kitada, Tetsuya Tabata"

Global identification of bursicon-regulated genes in Drosophila melanogaster,18801173,10.1186/1471-2164-9-424,"Background:
      
    

    
      Bursicon is a heterodimer neuropeptide responsible for regulating cuticle sclerotization and wing expansion in several insect species. Recent studies indicate that the action of bursicon is mediated by a specific G protein-coupled receptor DLGR2 and the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. However, little is known regarding the genes that are regulated by bursicon. The identification of bursicon-regulated genes is the focus of this investigation.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We used DNA microarray analysis to identify bursicon-regulated genes in neck-ligated flies (Drosophila melanogaster) that received recombinant bursicon (r-bursicon). Fifty four genes were found to be regulated by bursicon 1 h post r-bursicon injection, 52 being up-regulated and 2 down-regulated while 33 genes were influenced by r-bursicon 3 h post-injection (24 up-regulated and 9 down-regulated genes). Analysis of these genes by inference from the fly database http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu revealed that these genes encode proteins with diverse functions, including cell signaling, gene transcription, DNA/RNA binding, ion trafficking, proteolysis-peptidolysis, metabolism, cytoskeleton formation, immune response and cell-adhesion. Twenty eight genes randomly selected from the microarray-identified list were verified by real time PCR (qPCR) which supported the microarray data. Temporal response studies of 13 identified and verified genes by qPCR revealed that the temporal expression patterns of these genes are consistent with the microarray data.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Using r-bursicon, we identified 87 genes that are regulated by bursicon, 30 of which have no previously known function. Most importantly, all genes randomly selected from the microarray-identified list were verified by real time PCR. Temporal analysis of 13 verified genes revealed that the expression of these genes was indeed induced by bursicon and correlated well with the cuticle sclerotization process. The composite data suggest that these genes play important roles in regulating the cuticle sclerotization and wing expansion processes. The data obtained here will form the basis for future studies aimed at elucidating the exact mechanisms upstream from the secretion of bursicon and its binding to target cells.",2008,"Shiheng An, Songjie Wang, Lawrence I Gilbert, Brenda Beerntsen, Mark Ellersieck, Qisheng Song, Shiheng An, Songjie Wang, Lawrence I Gilbert, Brenda Beerntsen, Mark Ellersieck, Qisheng Song"

Egg-laying rhythm in Drosophila melanogaster,19147938,10.1007/s12041-008-0072-9,"Extensive research has been carried out to understand how circadian clocks regulate various physiological processes in organisms. The discovery of clock genes and the molecular clockwork has helped researchers to understand the possible role of these genes in regulating various metabolic processes. In Drosophila melanogaster, many studies have shown that the basic architecture of circadian clocks is multi-oscillatory. In nature, different neuronal subgroups in the brain of D. melanogaster have been demonstrated to control different circadian behavioural rhythms or different aspects of the same circadian rhythm. Among the circadian phenomena that have been studied so far in Drosophila, the egg-laying rhythm is unique, and relatively less explored. Unlike most other circadian rhythms, the egg-laying rhythm is rhythmic under constant light conditions, and the endogenous or free-running period of the rhythm is greater than those of most other rhythms. Although the clock genes and neurons required for the persistence of adult emergence and activity/rest rhythms have been studied extensively, those underlying the circadian egg-laying rhythm still remain largely unknown.

We sequenced a part of the clone containing the coding region, the 5' untranslated region and approximately 2.8 Kb of the 5' flanking region of the gene. Phylogenetic analysis of several insect small heat shock proteins, suggested that CcHsp27 is orthologous to Drosophila Hsp27 and Sarcophaga crassipalpis Hsp25. The Cchsp27 gene was mapped at the 81A division of the sixth chromosome which coincides with one of the major heat shock puffs of medfly. Structural analysis of the 5' flanking region of the Cchsp27 gene revealed the presence of five putative heat shock elements and one putative ecdysone response element. In addition to heat induction, the Cchsp27 gene was expressed at several stages of normal medfly development. In general, the developmental expression pattern of the Cchsp27 gene was similar to the respective pattern of Drosophila hsp27 gene. However, there were some important differences in certain developmental stages suggesting differential regulation of the hsp27 gene in the two dipterans species.

A protein kinase C activity localized to neuropeptide Y-like neurons mediates ethanol intoxication in Drosophila melanogaster,18675322,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.07.008,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) regulates acute ethanol sensitivity and voluntary alcohol consumption in rodents. In Drosophila melanogaster, NPY-like neuropeptide F (NPF) and its receptor NPFR1 display a parallel function, suggesting that an evolutionarily conserved mechanism may underlie similar behavioral effects of ethanol in diverse organisms. We have used the fly model to uncover novel genes and molecular pathways important for acute ethanol response. Here we report a critical role of the conserved protein kinase C (PKC) pathway in mediating the intoxicating effect of ethanol. Flies expressing a pseudo-substrate inhibitor of PKC, directed by npf-gal4, displayed decreased ethanol sensitivity. Furthermore, the RNA interference analysis suggests that a calcium-independent PKC isoform (PKC98E, related to mammalian novel PKCs) is largely responsible for the behavioral phenotype. Finally, we provide evidence that the NPF/PKC-dependent mechanism selectively affects acute sensitivity but not rapid tolerance to ethanol intoxication. These findings reveal an uncharacterized role of PKC in NPY/NPF-mediated acute ethanol sensitivity in flies and possibly mammals.",2008,"J Chen, Y Zhang, P Shen, J Chen, Y Zhang, P Shen"
Cooperativity between the beta-tubulin carboxy tail and the body of the molecule is required for microtubule function,18802936,10.1002/cm.20318,"Using Drosophila spermatogenesis as a model, we show that function of the beta-tubulin C-terminal tail (CTT) is not independent of the body of the molecule. For optimal microtubule function, the beta-tubulin CTT and body must match. beta2 is the only beta-tubulin used in meiosis and spermatid differentiation. beta1-tubulin is used in basal bodies, but beta1 cannot replace beta2. However, when beta1 is co-expressed with beta2, both beta-tubulins are equally incorporated into all microtubules, and males exhibit near wild type fertility. In contrast, co-expression of beta2beta1C and beta1beta2C, two reciprocal chimeric molecules with bodies and tails swapped, results in defects in meiosis, cytoskeletal microtubules, and axonemes; males produce few functional sperm and few or no progeny. In these experiments, all the same beta-tubulin parts are present, but unlike the co-assembled native beta-tubulins, the ""trans"" configuration of the co-assembled chimeras is poorly functional. Our data thus reveal essential intra-molecular interactions between the CTT and other parts of the beta-tubulin molecule, even though the CTT is a flexible surface feature of tubulin heterodimers and microtubules. In addition, we show that Drosophila sperm tail length depends on the total tubulin pool available for axoneme assembly and spermatid elongation. D. melanogaster and other Drosophila species have extraordinarily long sperm tails, the length of which is remarkably constant in wild type flies. We show that in males of experimental genotypes that express wild type tubulins but have half the amount of the normal tubulin pool size, sperm tails are substantially shorter than wild type.",2008,"Ellen M Popodi, Henry D Hoyle, F Rudolf Turner, Elizabeth C Raff, Ellen M Popodi, Henry D Hoyle, F Rudolf Turner, Elizabeth C Raff"

A mucin-type O-glycosyltransferase modulates cell adhesion during Drosophila development,18835818,10.1074/jbc.M804267200,"Cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion are crucial during many stages of eukaryotic development. Here, we provide the first example that mucin-type O-linked glycosylation is involved in a developmentally regulated cell adhesion event in Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations in one member of the evolutionarily conserved family of enzymes that initiates O-linked glycosylation alter epithelial cell adhesion in the Drosophila wing blade. A transposon insertion mutation in pgant3 or RNA interference to pgant3 resulted in blistered wings, a phenotype characteristic of genes involved in integrin-mediated cell interactions. Expression of wild type pgant3 in the mutant background rescued the wing blistering phenotype, whereas expression of another family member (pgant35A) did not, revealing a unique requirement for pgant3. pgant3 mutants displayed reduced O-glycosylation along the basal surface of larval wing imaginal discs, which was restored with wild type pgant3 expression, suggesting that reduced glycosylation of basal proteins is responsible for disruption of adhesion in the adult wing blade. Glycosylation reactions demonstrated that PGANT3 glycosylates certain extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that PGANT3 glycosylates tiggrin, an ECM protein known to bind integrin. We propose that this glycosyltransferase is uniquely responsible for glycosylating tiggrin in the wing disc, thus modulating proper cell adhesion through integrin-ECM interactions. This study provides the first evidence for the role of O-glycosylation in a developmentally regulated, integrin-mediated, cell adhesion event and reveals a novel player in wing blade formation during Drosophila development.",2008,"Liping Zhang, Ying Zhang, Kelly G Ten Hagen, Liping Zhang, Ying Zhang, Kelly G Ten Hagen"
Development of higher-level cognitive skills in a learner-centered lab on extensions of mendelian inheritance using Drosophila,23653819,10.1128/jmbe.v9.90,"Students can have difficulty comprehending complex concepts in science. They can memorize the definition but do not understand the underlying biological principles. In the Fundamentals of Genetics course at Arizona State University at the West campus, students grapple with the topic of ""extensions of Mendelism."" Additionally, in lab, students are challenged by scoring phenotypes that are not binary. Both of these concepts require that students understand not only inheritance but also the principles of protein structure and function. A genetics laboratory exercise was developed that combines study of some extensions of Mendelian inheritance with practice in manipulating Drosophila melanogaster and scoring subtle and variable phenotypes. Students analyze Drosophila with mutations that demonstrate some extensions of Mendelian inheritance: temperature sensitivity, variable expressivity, incomplete penetrance, multiple alleles, dosage compensation, and gene dosage effect. The phenotypes in some of these mutants differ from individual to individual and are difficult to discern; thus, students also gain experience in investigating challenging phenotypes. Pre- and postlab assessments indicate that performing this exercise increased students' mastery of the molecular basis of extensions of Mendelian inheritance and their abilities in scoring and manipulating flies. This is a discovery-based lab exercise in which students examine some extensions of Mendelian inheritance and gain experience in analyzing complex traits in Drosophila.",2008,"Pamela A Marshall, Pamela A Marshall"
Autosomal mutations affecting Y chromosome loops in Drosophila melanogaster,18405358,10.1186/1471-2156-9-32,"Background:
      
    

    
      The Y chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster harbors several genes required for male fertility. The genes for these fertility factors are very large in size and contain conspicuous amounts of repetitive DNA and transposons. Three of these loci (ks-1, kl-3 and kl-5) have the ability to develop giant lampbrush-like loops in primary spermatocytes, a cytological manifestation of their active state in these cells. Y-loops bind a number of non-Y encoded proteins, but the mechanisms regulating their development and their specific functions are still to be elucidated.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here we report the results of a screen of 726 male sterile lines to identify novel autosomal genes controlling Y-loop function. We analyzed mutant testis preparations both in vivo and by immunofluorescence using antibodies directed against Y-loop-associated proteins. This screen enabled us to isolate 17 mutations at 15 loci whose wild-type function is required for proper Y-loop morphogenesis. Six of these loci are likely to specifically control loop development, while the others display pleiotropic effects on both loops and meiotic processes such as spermiogenesis, sperm development and maturation. We also determined the map position of the mutations affecting exclusively Y-loop morphology.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our cytological screening permitted us to identify novel genetic functions required for male spermatogenesis, some of which show pleiotropic effects. Analysis of these mutations also shows that loop development can be uncoupled from meiosis progression.

QTL mapping of inbreeding-related cold sensitivity and conditional lethality in Drosophila melanogaster,18631212,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01572.x,"Inbreeding depression is a central theme within genetics, and is of specific interest for researchers within evolutionary and conservation genetics and animal and plant breeding. Inbreeding effects are thought to be caused by the joint expression of conditional and unconditional deleterious alleles. Whenever the expression of deleterious alleles is conditional, this can result in extreme environmental sensitivity in certain inbred lineages. Analysis of conditional lethal effects can reveal some of the loci that are sensitive to inbreeding. We performed a QTL (quantitative trait locus) mapping study of inbreeding-related and conditionally expressed lethality in Drosophila melanogaster. The lethal effect was triggered by exposure to a cold shock. We used a North Carolina crossing Design 3 to establish the mapping population, as well as to estimate the average dominance ratio and heritability. We found two QTL on the major autosomes carrying recessive lethals that caused male mortality, one of which also affected female mortality. More detailed study of these loci will provide information on the mechanistic basis and environmental sensitivity of inbreeding depression.",2008,"C J Vermeulen, R Bijlsma, V Loeschcke, C J Vermeulen, R Bijlsma, V Loeschcke"
The meaning of nonsense,18524595,10.1016/j.tcb.2008.04.005,"To ensure the accuracy of gene expression, eukaryotes have evolved several surveillance mechanisms. One of the best-studied quality control mechanisms is nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), which recognizes and degrades transcripts harboring a premature translation-termination codon (PTC), thereby preventing the production of faulty proteins. NMD regulates approximately 10% of human mRNAs, and its physiological importance is manifested by the fact that approximately 30% of disease-associated mutations generate PTCs. Although different mechanisms of PTC recognition have been proposed for different species, recent studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, plants and mammals suggest a conserved model. Here, we summarize the latest results and discuss an emerging model for NMD and its implications for the regulation of gene expression.",2008,"Lukas Stalder, Oliver MÃ¼hlemann, Lukas Stalder, Oliver MÃ¼hlemann"

We detected TART ORF1p throughout most of development and observed particularly high levels of protein in late larval and pupal stages. In late-stage larvae, ORF1p accumulates in brain and imaginal discs tissues, rather than in terminally differentiated larval tissues. Accumulation of ORF1p in imaginal discs is intriguing, since TART antisense RNA has previously been detected in imaginal discs, and we discuss the implications of these findings for TART regulation.",2008,"Patrick H Maxwell, John M Belote, Robert W Levis, Patrick H Maxwell, John M Belote, Robert W Levis"

We address this issue by comparing the performance of replicated noninbred and inbred Drosophila lines under field and laboratory conditions. We asked whether environment-dependent effects of inbreeding can be demonstrated for a field-fitness component in Drosophila, the ability of flies to locate resources, and associated the results with results on effects of inbreeding investigated in the laboratory. Inbreeding effects were evident when releases were undertaken under warm conditions, but not under cold conditions, which illustrates the environment-dependent nature of inbreeding depression. Inbreeding effects were much stronger in the field at warm temperatures than in laboratory stress tests, particularly for females. Effects of inbreeding based on performance in traditional inbreeding assays (viability, productivity) or from laboratory stress tests poorly predicted performance in the field. Inbreeding effects on resource location in the field can be strongly deleterious under some thermal conditions and involve traits not easily measured under laboratory conditions. More generally, inbreeding effects measured in captive populations may not necessarily predict their field performance, and programs to purge captive populations of deleterious alleles may not necessarily lead to fitness benefits in the wild.",2008,"Torsten N Kristensen, Volker Loeschcke, Ary A Hoffmann, Torsten N Kristensen, Volker Loeschcke, Ary A Hoffmann"

Adaptive evolution of newly emerged micro-RNA genes in Drosophila,18296702,10.1093/molbev/msn040,"How often micro-RNA (miRNA) genes emerged and how fast they evolved soon after their emergence are some of the central questions in the evolution of miRNAs. Because most known miRNA genes are ancient and highly conserved, these questions can be best answered by identifying newly emerged miRNA genes. Among the 78 miRNA genes in Drosophila reported before 2007, only 5 are confirmed to be newly emerged in the genus (although many more can be found in the newly reported data set; e.g., Ruby et al. 2007; Stark et al. 2007; Lu et al. 2008). These new miRNA genes have undergone numerous changes, even in the normally invariant mature sequences. Four of them (the miR-310/311/312/313 cluster, denoted miR-310s) were duplicated from other conserved miRNA genes. The fifth one (miR-303) appears to be a very young gene, originating de novo from a non-miRNA sequence recently. We sequenced these 5 miRNA genes and their neighboring regions from a worldwide collection of Drosophila melanogaster lines. The levels of divergence and polymorphism in these miRNA genes, vis-?-vis those of the neighboring DNA sequences, suggest that these 5 genes are evolving adaptively. Furthermore, the polymorphism pattern of miR-310s in D. melanogaster is indicative of hitchhiking under positive selection.

aubergine gene overexpression in somatic tissues of aubergine(sting) mutants interferes with the RNAi pathway of a yellow hairpin dsRNA in Drosophila melanogaster,18385112,10.1534/genetics.107.078626,"AUBERGINE (AUB) is a member of the PPD family of proteins. These proteins are implicated in RNA interference. In this article we demonstrate that the expression of the aub gene and protein increase in aub(sting) mutants. We used a genetic method to test whether aub(sting) overexpression could interfere with proper functioning of the process of RNA interference in somatic tissues of Drosophila melanogaster. This method is based on a transgenic line bearing a construct in which a fragment of the yellow (y) gene is cloned to form an inverted repeat (y-IR) under the control of the upstream activation sequence (UAS) of the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4. The UAS-y-IR transgene and the Act5C-GAL4 driver were brought together on chromosome 3 via recombination. In the resulting strain (Act5C-y-IR), transcriptional activation by GAL4 constitutively produces a dsRNA hairpin bearing cognate sequences to the yellow gene causing continuing degradation of y mRNA resulting in yellow(1) (y(1)) phenocopies. In this genetic background, the mutation of any factor involved in RNAi should repress degradation of y mRNA, restoring the wild-type phenotype.

Transcription-coupled methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 regulates dosage compensation by enhancing recruitment of the MSL complex in Drosophila melanogaster,18347056,10.1128/MCB.00006-08,"In Drosophila melanogaster, dosage compensation relies on the targeting of the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex to hundreds of sites along the male X chromosome. Transcription-coupled methylation of histone H3 lysine 36 is enriched toward the 3' end of active genes, similar to the MSL proteins. Here, we have studied the link between histone H3 methylation and MSL complex targeting using RNA interference and chromatin immunoprecipitation. We show that trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3) relies on the histone methyltransferase Hypb and is localized promoter distal at dosage-compensated genes, similar to active genes on autosomes. However, H3K36me3 has an X-specific function, as reduction specifically decreases acetylation of histone H4 lysine 16 on the male X chromosome. This hypoacetylation is caused by compromised MSL binding and results in a failure to increase expression twofold. Thus, H3K36me3 marks the body of all active genes yet is utilized in a chromosome-specific manner to enhance histone acetylation at sites of dosage compensation.",2008,"Oliver Bell, Thomas Conrad, Jop Kind, Christiane Wirbelauer, Asifa Akhtar, Dirk SchÃ¼beler, Oliver Bell, Thomas Conrad, Jop Kind, Christiane Wirbelauer, Asifa Akhtar, Dirk SchÃ¼beler"
Genomic P elements content of a wild M' strain of Drosophila melanogaster: KP elements do not always function as type II repressor elements,18379135,10.1266/ggs.83.67,"The P element is one of the best-studied DNA transposons as a model system to study evolution of mobile DNAs. The P element is a causative factor for P-M hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster and the P-M phenotype (P, Q, or M) has been thought to reflect genomic P elements content. Recent survey of natural populations showed that full-size P (FP) and KP elements are predominant in almost all current populations, irrespective of their phenotype variation. It was also suggested that some P elements are functionally inactive and their inactivation plays an important role in determining P-M phenotype. In order to know how the genomic P elements are inactivated, we characterized molecular features and insertion sites of them in an M' strain. We isolated 20 P elements, one FP, 15 KP, and four other internally deleted defective elements, all of which appeared thoroughly inactive. These FP and KP elements had canonical sequences in each case, but no mutations abolishing their function. In addition, they were mostly located in or within the vicinity of presumably active genes. Our results suggest that inactivation of P elements is associated with neither mutations nor constitutional suppression by heterochromatinization in M' strains and that only a few elements inserted in some special chromosomal regions are likely to be involved in determination of the phenotype of individual flies. Existence of many copies of canonical, but inactive, KP elements in the M' strain is inconsistent with the assumption that type II repression of the KP element is the main reason for its increase in the wild populations of D. melanogaster.",2008,"Tomokazu Fukui, Yutaka Inoue, Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Masanobu Itoh, Tomokazu Fukui, Yutaka Inoue, Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Masanobu Itoh"

Canton-S, a resistant strain, showed increased capacity to induce stronger innate immune activities (antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), phenol oxidase activity, and phagocytosis) compared to the susceptible strain (white) at early time points during bacterial infection. Moreover, PGRP-LE-induced innate immune activation immediately after infection greatly improves survival of the susceptible strain strongly suggesting a mechanism behind the natural genetic variation of these two strains.

Therefore, to explore these effects, we examined expression patterns of genes in several Drosophila deficiency hemizygotes and a duplication hemizygote using microarrays. The results indicate that genes expressed in deficiency hemizygotes are significantly buffered, and that the buffering effect is general rather than being mainly mediated by feedback regulation of individual genes. In addition, differentially expressed genes in haploid condition appear to be generally more strongly buffered than ubiquitously expressed genes in haploid condition, but, among genes present in triploid condition, ubiquitously expressed genes are generally more strongly buffered than differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, we show that the 4th chromosome is compensated in response to dose differences.

Early embryonic lethality of Znt1 knockout mice precludes functional analysis of the role of ZnT1 in dietary zinc absorption. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the Drosophila ZnT1 orthologue, dZnT1, for its role in Drosophila dietary zinc absorption. In cell culture, dZnT1 promoted zinc transport to reduce cytoplasmic zinc levels. Ubiquitous RNA interference of dZnT1 in Drosophila resulted in developmental arrest under restriction of dietary zinc, while dZnT1-overexpressing flies exhibited hypersensitivity to zinc. dZnT1 was prominently expressed in restricted regions of the midgut and exhibited a distribution on the basolateral membrane of the enterocytes. Gut-specific silencing of dZnT1 was sufficient to evoke lethality under zinc scarcity. Human ZnT1, but not ZnT7 or ZnT4, could rescue the zinc-acquiring defects caused by dZnT1 silencing. Taken together, our results proved that dZnT1 is a key zinc transporter in dietary zinc absorption, functioning by pumping zinc out of the enterocytes across the basolateral membrane. This study will be helpful in understanding the fundamental process of acquiring dietary zinc in higher eukaryotes.",2009,"Xiaoxi Wang, Yuantai Wu, Bing Zhou, Xiaoxi Wang, Yuantai Wu, Bing Zhou"

Curled encodes the Drosophila homolog of the vertebrate circadian deadenylase Nocturnin,19581445,10.1534/genetics.109.105601,"Drosophila melanogaster curled, one of the first fly mutants described by T. H. Morgan >90 years ago, is the founding member of a series of curled wing phenotype mutants widely used as markers in fruit fly genetics. The expressivity of the wing phenotype is environmentally modulated, suggesting that the mutation affects the metabolic status of cells rather than a developmental control gene. However, the molecular identity of any of the curled wing marker mutant genes is still unknown. In a screen for starvation-responsive genes, we previously identified the single fly homolog of the vertebrate nocturnin genes, which encode cytoplasmic deadenylases that act in the post-transcriptional control of genes by poly(A) tail removal of target mRNAs prior to their degradation. Here we show that curled encodes Drosophila Nocturnin and that the gene is required at pupal stage for proper wing morphogenesis after eclosion of the fly. Despite the complex ontogenetic expression pattern of the gene, curled is not expressed in the developing wing, and wing-specific curled knockdown mediated by RNAi does not result in the curled wing phenotype, indicating a tissue-nonautonomous, systemic mode of curled gene function. Our study not only presents an entry point into the functional analysis of invertebrate nocturnins but also paves the way for the identification of the still elusive Nocturnin target mRNAs by genetic suppressor screens on the curled wing phenotype.",2009,"Sebastian GrÃ¶nke, Iris Bickmeyer, Roman Wunderlich, Herbert JÃ¤ckle, Ronald P KÃ¼hnlein, Sebastian GrÃ¶nke, Iris Bickmeyer, Roman Wunderlich, Herbert JÃ¤ckle, Ronald P KÃ¼hnlein"
Evolution of the Drosophila nuclear pore complex results in multiple hybrid incompatibilities,19197064,10.1126/science.1169123,"Speciation often involves the evolution of incompatible gene interactions that cause sterility or lethality in hybrids between populations.

We show that the nucleoporin 160kDa (Nup160) gene of the fruitfly Drosophila simulans is incompatible with one or more factors on the D. melanogaster X chromosome, causing hybrid lethality. Nup160 encodes a nuclear pore complex protein and shows evidence of adaptive evolution. Furthermore, the protein encoded by Nup160 directly interacts with that of another hybrid lethality gene, Nup96, indicating that at least two lethal hybrid incompatibility genes have evolved as byproducts of divergent coevolution among interacting components of the Drosophila nuclear pore complex.",2009,"Shanwu Tang, Daven C Presgraves, Shanwu Tang, Daven C Presgraves"
Ana3 is a conserved protein required for the structural integrity of centrioles and basal bodies,19948479,10.1083/jcb.200905031,"Recent studies have identified a conserved ""core"" of proteins that are required for centriole duplication. A small number of additional proteins have recently been identified as potential duplication factors, but it is unclear whether any of these proteins are components of the core duplication machinery. In this study, we investigate the function of one of these proteins, Drosophila melanogaster Ana3. We show that Ana3 is present in centrioles and basal bodies, but its behavior is distinct from that of the core duplication proteins. Most importantly, we find that Ana3 is required for the structural integrity of both centrioles and basal bodies and for centriole cohesion, but it is not essential for centriole duplication. We show that Ana3 has a mammalian homologue, Rotatin, that also localizes to centrioles and basal bodies and appears to be essential for cilia function. Thus, Ana3 defines a conserved family of centriolar proteins and plays an important part in ensuring the structural integrity of centrioles and basal bodies.",2009,"Naomi R Stevens, Jeroen Dobbelaere, Alan Wainman, Fanni Gergely, Jordan W Raff, Naomi R Stevens, Jeroen Dobbelaere, Alan Wainman, Fanni Gergely, Jordan W Raff"
Neuronal susceptibility to GRIM in Drosophila melanogaster measures the rate of genetic changes that scale to lifespan,19428445,10.1016/j.mad.2009.01.002,"Gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster changes significantly throughout life and some of these changes can be delayed by lowering ambient temperature and also by dietary restriction. These two interventions are known to slow the rate of aging as well as the accumulation of damage. It is unknown, however, whether gene expression changes that occur during development and early adult life make an animal more vulnerable to death. Here we develop a method capable of measuring the rate of programmed genetic changes during young adult life in D. melanogaster and show that these changes can be delayed or accelerated in a manner that is predictive of longevity. We show that temperature shifts and dietary restriction, which slow the rate of aging in D. melanogaster, extend the window of neuronal susceptibility to GRIM over-expression in a way that scales to lifespan. We propose that this susceptibility can be used to test compounds and genetic manipulations that alter the onset of senescence by changing the programmed timing of gene expression that correlates and may be causal to aging.",2009,"Matthew A Bedoukian, Sarah M Rodriguez, Matthew B Cohen, Stuart V Duncan Smith, Jennifer Park"

These baselines differ dramatically for KRHT. Because nearly-homozygous lines were used, reciprocal backcrosses were informative to test for dominant versus additive genetic associations between the traits. The line of high KRHT was longer lived than the low KRHT line. The correlation between longevity and KRHT was dependent on the backcross (BC). When a BC was set up with males from the low KRHT line, the most KRHT resistant individuals were in turn the longest-lived flies. However, this was not found in the reciprocal backcross, indicating dominance. Alleles that confer increased KRHT are dominant in the correlation between longevity and KRHT.

The potential adaptive significance of TEs was recognized by those involved in their initial discovery although it was hotly debated afterwards. For more than two decades, TEs were considered to be intragenomic parasites leading to almost exclusively detrimental effects to the host genome. The sequencing of the Drosophila melanogaster genome provided an unprecedented opportunity to study TEs and led to the identification of the first TE-induced adaptations in this species. These studies were followed by a systematic genome-wide search for adaptive insertions that allowed for the first time to infer that TEs contribute substantially to adaptive evolution. This study also revealed that there are at least twice as many TE-induced adaptations that remain to be identified. To gain a better understanding of the adaptive role of TEs in the genome we clearly need to (i) identify as many adaptive TEs as possible in a range of Drosophila species as well as (ii) carry out in-depth investigations of the effects of adaptive TEs on as many phenotypes as possible.",2009,"Josefa GonzÃ¡lez, Dmitri A Petrov, Josefa GonzÃ¡lez, Dmitri A Petrov"

This test is based on the principle that loss of heterozygosis and the corresponding expression of the suitable recessive markers, multiple wing hairs (mwh) and flare-3 (flr(3)), can lead to the formation of mutant clones in larval cells, which are then expressed as spots on the wings of adult flies. BNM and TCNM were supplied to third instar larvae (72+/-4 h-old) at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2 mM.

Five genes, HP6, pigeon, lace, X box binding protein 1 and guftagu were found to carry replication-related element (DRE) sequences in their 5'-flanking regions. Of these, the HP6 gene carries two sequences that match seven out of eight nucleotides of DRE and two additional sequences that match six out of eight nucleotides of DRE in the 5'-flanking region. Band mobility shift assays using Drosophila Kc cell nuclear extracts demonstrated DREF binding to two of these sites and chromatin immunoprecipitation using anti-DREF antibodies confirmed that this occurs in vivo. Knockdown of DREF in Drosophila S2 cells decreased the HP6 mRNA level. The results, taken together, indicate that DREF directly regulates expression of the HP6 gene.

FGF ligands in Drosophila have distinct activities required to support cell migration and differentiation,19158183,10.1242/dev.027904,"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling controls a vast array of biological processes including cell differentiation and migration, wound healing and malignancy. In vertebrates, FGF signaling is complex, with over 100 predicted FGF ligand-receptor combinations. Drosophila melanogaster presents a simpler model system in which to study FGF signaling, with only three ligands and two FGF receptors (FGFRs) identified. Here we analyze the specificity of FGFR [Heartless (Htl) and Breathless (Btl)] activation by each of the FGF ligands [Pyramus (Pyr), Thisbe (Ths) and Branchless (Bnl)] in Drosophila. We confirm that both Pyr and Ths can activate Htl, and that only Bnl can activate Btl. To examine the role of each ligand in supporting activation of the Htl FGFR, we utilize genetic approaches that focus on the earliest stages of embryonic development. When pyr and ths are equivalently expressed using the Gal4 system, these ligands support qualitatively different FGFR signaling responses. Both Pyr and Ths function in a non-autonomous fashion to support mesoderm spreading during gastrulation, but Pyr exhibits a longer functional range. pyr and ths single mutants exhibit defects in mesoderm spreading during gastrulation, yet only pyr mutants exhibit severe defects in dorsal mesoderm specification. We demonstrate that the Drosophila FGFs have different activities and that cell migration and differentiation have different ligand requirements. Furthermore, these FGF ligands are not regulated solely by differential expression, but the sequences of these linked genes have evolved to serve different functions. We contend that inherent properties of FGF ligands make them suitable to support specific FGF-dependent processes, and that FGF ligands are not always interchangeable.",2009,"Snehalata Kadam, Amy McMahon, Phoebe Tzou, Angelike Stathopoulos, Snehalata Kadam, Amy McMahon, Phoebe Tzou, Angelike Stathopoulos"
[Changes of the life span and certain biochemical indexes on Drosophila melanogaster by ethanol exposure],19408653,,"Objective:
      
    

    
      To explore the effect of ethanol on the life span and the activities of SOD and GSH-Px as well as the contents of MBA in Drosophila melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Newly trapped and not mated 7200 flies were collected within 8 hours and separated by sex. 2400 flies were selected and randomly divided into six groups (0, 9, 27, 90, 270 and 8l0 mmol/L). Each group contained 400 flies, 200 male flies and 200 female flies. The numbers of dead flies were counted everyday and the culture mediums were replaced every 4 days until all flies died. Another 4800 flies were randomly divided into 4 groups (0, 27, 90 and 270 mmol/L). Each group contained 1200 flies, half male and half female. The activities of SOD and GSH-Px as well as the contents of MBA were detected at the days of 0th, 10th, 20th and 30th after ethanol exposure. Results The life span of Drosophila exposed to high dose ethanol reduced obviously. Activities of SOD and GSH-Px and contents of MDA of Drosophila exposed to ethanol reduced and enhanced with increasing of ethanol doses. And at the same doses (90 mmol/L and 270 mmol/L), activities of SOD and GSH-Px reduced, while contents of MDA elevated with increasing of exposure time. Exposed to high dose of ethanol at the days of 20 or 30, activities of SOD and GSH-Px and contents of MDA in Drosophila reduced and enhanced significantly in comparison with control group.

A tumor suppressor activity of Drosophila Polycomb genes mediated by JAK-STAT signaling,19749759,10.1038/ng.445,"A prevailing paradigm posits that Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins maintain stem cell identity by repressing differentiation genes, and abundant evidence points to an oncogenic role for PcG proteins in human cancer. Here we show using Drosophila melanogaster that a conventional PcG complex can also have a potent tumor suppressor activity. Mutations in any core PRC1 component cause pronounced hyperproliferation of eye imaginal tissue, accompanied by deregulation of epithelial architecture. The mitogenic JAK-STAT pathway is strongly and specifically activated in mutant tissue; activation is driven by transcriptional upregulation of Unpaired (Upd, also known as Outstretched, Os) family ligands. We show here that upd genes are direct targets of PcG-mediated repression in imaginal discs. Ectopic JAK-STAT activity is sufficient to induce overproliferation, whereas reduction of JAK-STAT activity suppresses the PRC1 mutant tumor phenotype. These findings show that PcG proteins can restrict growth directly by silencing mitogenic signaling pathways, shedding light on an epigenetic mechanism underlying tumor suppression.",2009,"Anne-Kathrin Classen, Brandon D Bunker, Kieran F Harvey, Thomas Vaccari, David Bilder, Anne-Kathrin Classen, Brandon D Bunker, Kieran F Harvey, Thomas Vaccari, David Bilder"
Effects of benzoylphenylurea on chitin synthesis and orientation in the cuticle of the Drosophila larva,18996617,10.1016/j.ejcb.2008.09.002,"Chitin is an essential constituent of the insect exoskeleton, the cuticle, which is an extracellular matrix (ECM) covering the animal. It is produced by the glycosyltransferase chitin synthase at the apical plasma membrane of epidermal and tracheal cells. To fulfil its role in cuticle elasticity and stiffness it associates with proteins, thereby adopting a stereotypic arrangement of helicoidally stacked sheets, which run parallel to the surface of the animal. One approach to understand the mechanisms of chitin synthesis and organisation is to dissect these processes genetically. However, since only a few genes coding for factors involved in chitin synthesis and organisation have been identified to date using the model arthropod Drosophila melanogaster insight arising from mutant analysis is rather limited. To collect new data on the role of chitin during insect cuticle differentiation, we have analysed the effects of chitin synthesis inhibitors on Drosophila embryogenesis. For this purpose, we have chosen the benzoylphenylurea diflubenzuron and lufenuron that are widely used as insect growth regulators. Our data allow mainly two important conclusions. First, correct organisation of chitin seems to directly depend on the amount of chitin synthesised. Second, chitin synthesis and organisation are cell-autonomous processes as insecticide-treated larvae display a mosaic of cuticle defects. As benzoylphenylurea are used not only as insecticides but also as anti-diabetic drugs, the study of their impact on Drosophila cuticle differentiation may be fruitful for understanding their mode of action on a cellular pathway that is seemingly conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates.",2009,"Umesh Gangishetti, Sophie Breitenbach, Mareike Zander, Shaik Khaleelulla Saheb, Ursula MÃ¼ller, Heinz Schwarz, Bernard Moussian, Umesh Gangishetti, Sophie Breitenbach, Mareike Zander, Shaik Khaleelulla Saheb, Ursula MÃ¼ller, Heinz Schwarz, Bernard Moussian"

We found that the proximal 237 bp of the 5' flanking region of Acp65A were sufficient to mediate this suppression. A targeted point mutation of a putative BR-Z1 response element (BRE) within this region showed that it was not involved. Drosophila hormone receptor-like 38 (DHR38) is required for Acp65A expression. We found that BR-Z1 repressed DHR38 expression and that BR's inhibition of Acp65A expression was rescued by exogenous expression of DHR38.

Upon ectopic salm expression, dorsally located second leg disc cells develop notum and wing hinge tissue instead of sternopleural tissue. Similarly, by salm over-expression within the wing disc, wing blade formation is suppressed and a mirror-image duplication of the notum and wing hinge is formed. In large dorsal clones, which lack salm and its neighboring paralogue spalt related (salr), the cells of the notum primordium do not grow; these dorsal cells are not specified as notum, hence no notum outgrowth develops. These results suggest that the zinc finger factors encoded by the salm/salr complex play important roles in defining cells of the early wing disc as dorsal body wall cells, which develop into a large dorsal body wall territory and form mesonotum and some wing hinge tissue, and in delimiting the wing primordium.

A comparison of the phylogenetic tree of our roo and rooA elements shows that the split between roo and rooA took place early in Drosophila evolution. Furthermore there is one incongruency between the species tree and the phylogenetic tree of the roo element. This incongruency regards the placement of elements from D. mojavensis, which are more closely related to D. melanogaster than elements from D. willistoni.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Within genomes, the evolutionary dynamics of roo and rooA range from recent transpositional activity to slow decay and extinction. Among genomes, the balance of phylogenetic evidence, sequence divergence distribution, and the occurrence of solo-LTR elements suggests an origin of roo/rooA within the Drosophila clade. We discuss the possibility of a horizontal gene transfer of roo within this clade.",2009,"Nicole de la Chaux, Andreas Wagner, Nicole de la Chaux, Andreas Wagner"
Inhalation method for delivery of nanoparticles to the Drosophila respiratory system for toxicity testing,19875151,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.10.008,"The growth of the nanotechnology industry and subsequent proliferation of nanoparticle types present the need to rapidly assess nanoparticle toxicity. We present a novel, simple and cost-effective nebulizer-based method to deliver nanoparticles to the Drosophila melanogaster respiratory system, for the purpose of toxicity testing. FluoSpheres, silver, and CdSe/ZnS nanoparticles of different sizes were effectively aerosolized, showing the system is capable of functioning with a wide range of nanoparticle types and sizes. Red fluorescent CdSe/ZnS nanoparticles were successfully delivered to the fly respiratory system, as visualized by fluorescent microscopy. Silver coated and uncoated nanoparticles were delivered in a toxicity test, and induced Hsp70 expression in flies, confirming the utility of this model in toxicity testing. This is the first method developed capable of such delivery, provides the advantage of the Drosophila health model, and can serve as a link between tissue culture and more expensive mammalian models in a tiered toxicity testing strategy.",2009,"Ryan Posgai, Maqusood Ahamed, Saber M Hussain, John J Rowe, Mark G Nielsen, Ryan Posgai, Maqusood Ahamed, Saber M Hussain, John J Rowe, Mark G Nielsen"
X-linked variation in immune response in Drosophila melanogaster,19822734,10.1534/genetics.108.093971,"This study quantifies the effects of naturally occurring X-linked variation on immune response in Drosophila melanogaster to assess associations between immunity genotypes and innate immune response. We constructed a set of 168 X-chromosomal extraction lines, incorporating X chromosomes from a natural population into co-isogenic autosomal backgrounds, and genotyped the lines at 88 SNPs in 20 X-linked immune genes. We find that genetic variation in many of the genes is associated with immune response phenotypes, including bacterial load and immune gene expression. Many of the associations act in a sex-specific or sexually antagonistic manner, supporting the theory that with the selective pressures facing genes on the X chromosome, sexually antagonistic variation may be more easily maintained.",2009,"Erin M Hill-Burns, Andrew G Clark, Erin M Hill-Burns, Andrew G Clark"
The immune response attenuates growth and nutrient storage in Drosophila by reducing insulin signaling,19861550,10.1073/pnas.0906749106,"Innate immunity is the primary and most ancient defense against infection. Although critical to survival, coordinating protection against a foreign organism is energetically costly, creating the need to reallocate substrates from nonessential functions, such as growth and nutrient storage. However, the mechanism by which infection or inflammation leads to a reduction in energy utilization by these dispensable processes is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that activation of the Toll signaling pathway selectively in the fat body, the major immune and lipid storage organ of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, leads to both induction of immunity and reallocation of resources. Toll signaling in the fat body suppresses insulin signaling both within these cells and non-autonomously throughout the organism, leading to a decrease in both nutrient stores and growth. These data suggest that communication between these two regulatory systems evolved as a means to divert energy in times of need from organismal growth to the acute requirement of combating infection.",2009,"Justin R DiAngelo, Michelle L Bland, Shelly Bambina, Sara Cherry, Morris J Birnbaum, Justin R DiAngelo, Michelle L Bland, Shelly Bambina, Sara Cherry, Morris J Birnbaum"

[Interaction of directional and stabilizing selection for wing characteristics in Drosophila melanogaster],2127406,,"The effects of interaction of artificial directional and stabilizing selection were studied using a recessive mutation of Drosophila melanogaster radius incompletus which causes interruption of the second longitudinal wing vein (L2). The character under directional selection was the length of the proximal segment of L2; stabilizing selection was conducted for a complex of morphometric wing characters. Three experimental designs in three replications were used: 1) directional and stabilizing selection; 2) directional selection; 3) unselected controls. The dynamics and variation of the character under directional selection was shown to be different in the stabilized and unstabilized lines. Coefficient of variation which increased in the unstabilized lines remained at the same level in the stabilized lines and in the controls. The results are in agreement with those of the previous experiment, where directional selection was conducted for a behavioral trait, which suggests general character of the relationships observed.",1990,"O E LazebnyÄ­, A G Imasheva, L A ZhivotovskiÄ­, O E LazebnyÄ­, A G Imasheva, L A ZhivotovskiÄ­"
Type I (R1) and type II (R2) ribosomal DNA insertions of Drosophila melanogaster are retrotransposable elements closely related to those of Bombyx mori,1690812,10.1016/0022-2836(90)90303-4,"Approximately 50% of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) units of Drosophila melanogaster are inactivated by two different 28 S RNA ribosomal gene insertions (type I and type II). We present here the nucleotide sequence of complete type I and type II elements. Conceptual translation of these sequences revealed open reading frames (ORFs) encoding amino acid residues conserved in all retrotransposable elements. Full-length type I elements are 5.35 x 10(3) base-pairs in length and contain two overlapping ORFs. The smaller ORF (471 amino acid residues) has similarity to gag genes, while the larger ORF (1021 residues) has similarity to pol genes. Full-length type II elements are 3.6 x 10(3) base-pairs and contain one large ORF (1056 residues) that appears to represent a gag-pol fusion. Type I and type II elements are similar in structure, in the proteins they encode, and in insertion specificity to the R1Bm and R2Bm retrotransposable elements of Bombyx mori. We suggest that the D. melanogaster elements be called R1Dm and R2Dm, to reflect their structure as retrotransposons. Comparison of the R1 and R2 elements from these two widely different species revealed regions of the ORF that are likely to play an important role in the propagation of the elements. Four distinct regions of sequence conservation separated by regions of little or no sequence similarity were detected for both the R1 and R2 elements: (1) cysteine motifs of the gag gene, with three such motifs for R1 and one motif for R2; (2) a reverse transcriptase domain; (3) an integrase domain located carboxyl terminal to the reverse transcriptase region; and (4) a small region amino terminal to the reverse transcriptase domain, whose function is not known. The level of identity of the amino acid residues for these segments is 28 to 34% between the R1 elements, and 34 to 39% for the R2 elements. Finally, it may be predicted that the mechanism of unequal crossover might eventually eliminate R1 and R2 from the rDNA locus. The long history of selection at the protein level exhibited by these elements indicates that it is their active transposition that maintains them in the locus. The high level of sequence homogeneity between copies of each element within the same species is consistent with the high turnover rate expected to result from these processes.",1990,"J L Jakubczak, Y Xiong, T H Eickbush, J L Jakubczak, Y Xiong, T H Eickbush"
Use of differential DNA-repair host mediated assays to investigate the biotransformation of xenobiotics in Drosophila melanogaster. I. Genotoxic effects of nitrosamines,2114223,10.1016/0009-2797(90)90019-j,"A rapid differential DNA-repair assay procedure was developed to investigate the biotransformation of xenobiotics in Drosophila melanogaster in vivo. Indicator of genotoxic activity was a pair of streptomycin-dependent Escherichia coli strains differing vastly in DNA repair capacity (uvr+/rec+ vs. uvrB/recA). Prior to the experiments with test compounds, mixtures of the two strains were injected into the abdomina of untreated animal hosts (male Berlin-K flies) and the time-dependent recovery kinetics determined. Subsequently, different aliphatic and aromatic nitrosamines were tested. Solutions of the compounds were injected simultaneously with the indicator cells. Three hours later, the flies were killed, homogenized and the induction of (repairable) DNA damage determined by comparison of the survival rates of the two strains in single animals. Eight carcinogenic compounds (nitrosodiethylamine, NDEA; nitrosodimethylamine, NDMA; nitrosodi-npropylamine, NDPA; nitrosodiethanolamine, NDELA; nitrosomethylaniline, NMA; 4-methyl-nitrosopiperidine, MNPIP; nitrosopyrrolidine, NPYR; nitrosomorpholine, NMOR) and one whose tumorigenic activities are still controversially discussed (nitrosodiphenylamine, NDPhA) induced dose-dependent differential killing effects in the present system. One agent which has not been found carcinogenic in rodents (2.6-dimethyl-nitrosopiperidiine. NDMPIP) gave negative results. The ranking order of genotoxic activities of the nitrosamines found in Drosophila in vivo is in good agreement with those of carcinogenic potencies established on the basis of experiments with rats. The most pronounced exceptions are the rather weak response towards NMA and the stronger DNA damaging activity of NMPIP compared to NDMA. Phenobarbital (5-ethyl-5-phenyl-2,4,6-trioxohepatahydropyramidine) (PB) feeding of the flies resulted in an increase of the DNA damaging potencies of all nitrosamines tested. Substantial enhancement of the induction of DNA damage was however, restricted to NDEA, NPYR and NMOR, whereas with nitrosodiphenylamine (NDPhA), NDELA and NDMA only a moderate (less than 25%) increase of differential killing effects was found. In the case of the two latter compounds, these results might be due to the fact that enzymes other than the MFO are involved in their activation. Attempts to localize the formation and/or distribution of metabolites in the bodies of fruitflies by separation of the tagmata of chemically treated animals and determination of genotoxic effects in the different segments indicate that the most pronounced effects occur in the abdomina whereas in heads and thoraxes comparatively lower activities are detectable.",1990,"S Knasmuller, A Szakmary, M Kehrer, S Knasmuller, A Szakmary, M Kehrer"
Identification of cis-regulatory elements required for larval expression of the Drosophila melanogaster alcohol dehydrogenase gene,2107121,,"The Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) genes of two distantly related species, Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila mulleri, display similar, but not identical, patterns of tissue-specific expression in larvae and adults. The regulatory DNA sequences necessary for wild-type Adh expression in D. mulleri larvae were previously reported. In this paper we present an analysis of the DNA sequences necessary for wild-type Adh expression in D. melanogaster larvae. We show that transcription from the proximal promoter of the melanogaster Adh gene is regulated by a far upstream enhancer and two or more elements near the transcription start site. The enhancer is tissue specific and stimulates transcription to high levels in fat body and to lower levels in midgut and malpighian tubules whether linked to the proximal promoter or to a heterologous promoter. The enhancer activity localized to at least two discrete regions dispersed over more than 1.7 kb of DNA. Deletion of any one of these subregions reduces Adh transcription in all three larval tissues. Similarly, two regions immediately upstream of the proximal promoter start site are necessary for wild-type transcription levels in all three tissues. Thus, each of the identified regulatory elements is sufficient for low levels of Adh gene expression in all three larval tissues, but maximal levels of expression requires the entire set.",1990,"V Corbin, T Maniatis, V Corbin, T Maniatis"
"Multiple, compensatory regulatory elements specify spermatocyte-specific expression of the Drosophila melanogaster hsp26 gene",2104657,10.1128/mcb.10.1.131,"The hsp26 gene of Drosophila melanogaster is expressed in six tissues during development and in a tissue-general response to heat shock. To be able to compare tissue-specific and heat-induced mechanisms of hsp26 expression, we have begun an analysis of the sequences involved in the spermatocyte-specific expression of the hsp26 gene by using germ line transformation. hsp26 mRNA synthesized in the spermatocytes has the same start site as sites previously demonstrated for nurse cell-specific and heat-induced mRNAs. Three regions of the hsp26 gene (nucleotides -351 to -135, -135 to -85, and +11 to +632) were able to stimulate spermatocyte-specific expression when fused with promoter sequences (nucleotides -85 to +11) that alone were insufficient to stimulate expression. These stimulatory regions appear to contain elements that provide redundant functions. While each region was able to stimulate expression independently, the deletion of any one region from a construct was without consequence as long as another compensatory region(s) was still present. There must reside, at a minimum, two independent spermatocyte-specifying elements within the sequences that encompass the three stimulatory regions and the promoter. At least one element is contained within sequences from -351 to -48. This region, in either orientation, can stimulate spermatocyte-specific expression from a heterologous promoter. A second element must reside in sequences from -52 to +632, since these sequences are also sufficient to direct spermatocyte-specific expression.",1990,"R L Glaser, J T Lis, R L Glaser, J T Lis"

A 14-kb genomic fragment from this region has been used for germ-line transformation of olfE mutant flies, and in one of three transformant lines obtained, rescue of the olfE phenotype is observed by two separate behavioral assays. Transcript analysis of the region that rescues the olfE phenotype has shown one major transcript at 5.4 kb and a minor one at 1.7 kb. Both of these transcripts are probably alternatively spliced products of the olfE gene. A developmental and tissue-specific profile of the 5.4-kb olfE message has shown that it is present at all developmental stages, suggesting that the gene may be multifunctional.",1990,"G Hasan, G Hasan"
A hybrid dysgenesis syndrome in Drosophila virilis,2249761,,"A new example of ""hybrid dysgenesis"" has been demonstrated in the F1 progeny of crosses between two different strains of Drosophila virilis. The dysgenic traits were observed only in hybrids obtained when wild-type females (of the Batumi strain 9 from Georgia, USSR) were crossed to males from a marker strain (the long-established laboratory strain, strain 160, carrying recessive markers on all its autosomes). The phenomena observed include high frequencies of male and female sterility, male recombination, chromosomal nondisjunction, transmission ratio distortion and the appearance of numerous visible mutations at different loci in the progeny of dysgenic crosses. The sterility demonstrated in the present study is similar to that of P-M dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster and apparently results from underdevelopment of the gonads in both sexes, this phenomenon being sensitive to developmental temperature. However, in contrast to the P-M and I-R dysgenic systems in D. melanogaster, in D. virilis the highest level of sterility (95-98%) occurs at 23-25 degrees. Several of the mutations isolated from the progeny of dysgenic crosses (e.g., singed) proved to be unstable and reverted to wild type.

The remainder of the coding sequence reveals extensive homology with other conventional myosins, especially metazoan nonmuscle and smooth muscle myosin isoforms.

Analysis of X-ray sensitivity demonstrated that 74% of the mutants assayed display some X-ray sensitivity, with 75% of the sensitive lines being extremely sensitive. Repair of single-strand breaks was assayed after both high and low doses of irradiation in order to permit detection of repair over a wide range of damage. The results of this investigation fail to show a correlation between X-ray sensitivity and this particular repair process. Repair of single-strand breaks is therefore mediated by repair processes unrelated to those that are disrupted in the current mutant collection.",1990,"D R Oliveri, P V Harris, J B Boyd, D R Oliveri, P V Harris, J B Boyd"

Morphological patterns of telomeres in each subline are stable, if flies are kept at 23 degrees C. It was demonstrated using this model that additional chromatin in the ""long"" telomeres hybridizes actively with 3H-labelled telomere-associated Dm665 probe. The ""short"" telomeres show far weaker hybridization, if any, with Dm665.

Two types of genetic interaction implicate the whirligig gene of Drosophila melanogaster in microtubule organization in the flagellar axoneme,2127579,,"The mutant nc4 allele of whirligig (3-54.4) of Drosophila melanogaster fails to complement mutations in an alpha-tubulin locus, alpha 1t, mutations in a beta-tubulin locus, B2t, or a mutation in the haywire locus. However, wrl fails to map to any of the known alpha- or beta-tubulin genes. The extragenic failure to complement could indicate that the wrl product participates in structural interactions with microtubule proteins. The whirligig locus appears to be haploinsufficient for male fertility. Both a deficiency of wrl and possible loss of function alleles obtained by reverting the failure to complement between wrlnc4 and B2tn are dominant male sterile in a genetic background wild type for tubulin. The dominant male sterility of the revertant alleles is suppressed if the flies are also heterozygous for B2tn, for a deficiency of alpha 1t, or for the haync2 allele. These results suggest that it is not the absolute level of wrl gene product but its level relative to tubulin or microtubule function that is important for normal spermatogenesis. The phenotype of homozygous wrl mutants suggests that the whirligig product plays a role in postmeiotic spermatid differentiation, possibly in organizing the microtubules of the sperm flagellar axoneme. Flies homozygous for either wrlnc4 or revertant alleles are viable and female fertile but male sterile. Premeiotic and meiotic stages of spermatogenesis appear normal. However, in post-meiotic stages, flagellar axonemes show loss of the accessory microtubule on the B-subfiber of outer doublet microtubules, outer triplet instead of outer doublet microtubules, and missing central pair microtubules.",1990,"L L Green, N Wolf, K L McDonald, M T Fuller, L L Green, N Wolf, K L McDonald, M T Fuller"

The ratios of reduced/oxidized glutathione and NADPH/NADP+, which are widely regarded as indicators of oxidative stress, decreased in the terminal phase of life. NADH/NAD+ ratio increased in the latter part of life. Concentration of inorganic peroxides increased during the first trimester of life and remained unchanged thereafter while that of thiobarbituric acid-reactants tended to decrease during aging.

It has been found recently that life span increases under caloric restriction also in sterile Drosophila females. This fact was explained by remodeling of metabolism due to insulin signaling. In this paper a hypothesis is put forward that under caloric restriction in the organism, the energy arrival decreases so that the stationary state must be restored. To achieve this, reproduction is reducing, remodeling of metabolism and the increasing of substrates output from the gastrointestinal tract start. The increase of life span can be just a side effect of these processes. Simulation demonstrates that the experimentally observed life span increasing in non-sterile fly females under caloric restriction can be explained exclusively by the reducing reproduction.",2010,"V N Novosel'tsev, Zh A Novosel'tseva, V N Novosel'tsev, Zh A Novosel'tseva"
The epigenetic trans-silencing effect in Drosophila involves maternally-transmitted small RNAs whose production depends on the piRNA pathway and HP1,20559422,10.1371/journal.pone.0011032,"Background:
      
    

    
      The study of P transposable element repression in Drosophila melanogaster led to the discovery of the Trans-Silencing Effect (TSE), a homology-dependent repression mechanism by which a P-transgene inserted in subtelomeric heterochromatin (Telomeric Associated Sequences, ""TAS"") has the capacity to repress in trans, in the female germline, a homologous P-lacZ transgene located in euchromatin. Phenotypic and genetic analysis have shown that TSE exhibits variegation in ovaries, displays a maternal effect as well as epigenetic transmission through meiosis and involves heterochromatin (including HP1) and RNA silencing.
    

    
  


        Principal findings:
      
    

    
      Here, we show that mutations in squash and zucchini, which are involved in the piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) silencing pathway, strongly affect TSE. In addition, we carried out a molecular analysis of TSE and show that silencing is correlated to the accumulation of lacZ small RNAs in ovaries. Finally, we show that the production of these small RNAs is sensitive to mutations affecting squash and zucchini, as well as to the dose of HP1.

The strength of transcription-factor binding modulates co-variation in transcriptional networks,20080313,10.1016/j.tig.2009.12.005,"An appreciable fraction of the transcriptome differs in level of expression among individuals. Transcription factor (TF) expression and DNA binding causes cell-specific activation and repression of downstream targets, and TF expression levels vary across individuals. However, it is not clear how the strength of DNA binding for individual TFs translates into regulatory control, or whether a different set of binding motifs is used for strongly regulated modules. Here we integrate two publicly available data sets in Drosophila melanogaster, as well as conduct novel analyses, to address these questions.",2010,"Sergey V Nuzhdin, Anna Rychkova, Matthew W Hahn, Sergey V Nuzhdin, Anna Rychkova, Matthew W Hahn"
Quantitative trait locus mapping of gravitaxis behaviour in Drosophila melanogaster,20667161,10.1017/S0016672310000194,"Drosophila melanogaster, like other organisms, move and orient themselves in response to the earth's gravitational force. The ability to sense and respond to gravity is essential for an organism to navigate and thrive in its environment. The genes underlying this behaviour in Drosophila remain elusive. Using 88 recombinant inbred lines, we have identified four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that contribute to adult gravitaxis (geotaxis) behaviour in Drosophila. Candidate genes of interest were selected from the QTLs of highest significance based on their function in chordotonal organ formation. Quantitative complementation tests with these candidate genes revealed a role for skittles in adult gravitaxis behaviour in D. melanogaster.",2010,"Christie E Desroches, Macarena Busto, Craig A L Riedl, Trudy F C Mackay, Marla B Sokolowski"
Dissecting differential gene expression within the circadian neuronal circuit of Drosophila,19966839,10.1038/nn.2451,"Behavioral circadian rhythms are controlled by a neuronal circuit consisting of diverse neuronal subgroups. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the roles of neuronal subgroups within the Drosophila circadian circuit, we used cell-type specific gene-expression profiling and identified a large number of genes specifically expressed in all clock neurons or in two important subgroups. Moreover, we identified and characterized two circadian genes, which are expressed specifically in subsets of clock cells and affect different aspects of rhythms. The transcription factor Fer2 is expressed in ventral lateral neurons; it is required for the specification of lateral neurons and therefore their ability to drive locomotor rhythms. The Drosophila melanogaster homolog of the vertebrate circadian gene nocturnin is expressed in a subset of dorsal neurons and mediates the circadian light response. The approach should also enable the molecular dissection of many different Drosophila neuronal circuits.",2010,"Emi Nagoshi, Ken Sugino, Ela Kula, Etsuko Okazaki, Taro Tachibana, Sacha Nelson, Michael Rosbash, Emi Nagoshi, Ken Sugino, Ela Kula, Etsuko Okazaki, Taro Tachibana, Sacha Nelson, Michael Rosbash"
Ubiquilin modifies TDP-43 toxicity in a Drosophila model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),20154090,10.1074/jbc.C109.078527,"TDP-43 (43-kDa TAR DNA-binding protein) is a major constituent of ubiquitin-positive cytosolic aggregates present in neurons of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ubiquitin-positive fronto-temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-U). Inherited mutations in TDP-43 have been linked to familial forms of ALS, indicating a key role for TDP-43 in disease pathogenesis. Here, we describe a Drosophila melanogaster model of TDP-43 proteinopathy. Expression of wild-type human TDP-43 protein in Drosophila motor neurons led to motor dysfunction and dramatic reduction of life span. Interestingly, coexpression of ubiquilin 1, a previously identified TDP-43-interacting protein with suspected functions in autophagy and proteasome targeting, reduced steady-state TDP-43 expression but enhanced the severity of TDP-43 phenotypes. Finally, ectopically expressed TDP-43 was largely localized to motor neuron nuclei, suggesting that expression of wild-type TDP-43 alone is detrimental even in the absence of cytosolic aggregation. Our findings demonstrate that TDP-43 exerts cell-autonomous neurotoxicity in Drosophila and further imply that dose-dependent alterations of TDP-43 nuclear function may underlie motor neuron death in ALS.",2010,"Keith A Hanson, Sang Hwa Kim, David A Wassarman, Randal S Tibbetts, Keith A Hanson, Sang Hwa Kim, David A Wassarman, Randal S Tibbetts"
A novel approach for in vivo screening of toxins using the Drosophila Giant Fiber circuit,20723555,10.1016/j.toxicon.2010.08.005,"Finding compounds that affect neuronal or muscular function is of great interest as potential therapeutic agents for a variety of neurological disorders. Alternative applications for these compounds include their use as molecular probes as well as insecticides. We have developed a bioassay that requires small amounts of compounds and allows for unbiased screening of biological activity in vivo. For this, we paired administering compounds in a non-invasive manner with simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from a well-characterized neuronal circuit, the Giant Fiber System of Drosophila melanogaster, which mediates the escape response of the fly. The circuit encompasses a variety of neurons with cholinergic, glutamatergic, and electrical synapses as well as neuromuscular junctions. Electrophysiological recordings from this system allow for the detection of compound-related effects against any molecular target on these components. Here, we provide evidence that this novel bioassay works with small molecules such as the cholinergic receptor blocker mecamylamine hydrochloride and the potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium hydroxide, as well as with venom from Conus brunneus and isolated conopeptides. Conopeptides have been developed into powerful drugs, such as the painkillers Prialt??and Xen2174. However, most conopeptides have yet to be characterized, revealing the need for a rapid and straightforward screening method. Our findings show that mecamylamine hydrochloride, as well as the Î±-conotoxin ImI, which is known to be an antagonist of the human Î±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, efficiently disrupted the synaptic transmission of a Drosophila Î±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-dependent pathway in our circuit but did not affect the function of neurons with other types of synapses.

Functional consequences of mutations in the Drosophila histamine receptor HCLB,19716373,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2009.08.016,"The gene hclB encodes a histamine-gated chloride channel subunit in Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations in hclB lead to defects in the visual system and altered sensitivity to the action of ivermectin. To investigate whether this member of the Cys-loop receptors is common across the Insecta, we analysed the genomes of seven other insect species (Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera) and revealed orthologues of hclB in all of them. Sequence comparisons showed high identity levels between the orthologues, indicating similar constraints and conserved function between the species. Two D. melanogaster mutants, hclB(T1) (P293S) and hclB(T2) (W111*, a null mutation) were tested for the lapse into, and recovery from, paralysis induced by high temperature or the anaesthetic action of halothane. At 41 degrees C, the hclB(T2) flies lapsed into coma faster than wild-type or the hclB(T1) flies, while both mutants recovered more slowly. A substantially impaired recovery rate was also observed in hclB(T1) after anaesthesia with halothane. Enhanced synaptic signalling at low-intensity light stimuli was registered on electroretinograms recorded from the two mutant strains.

Genes of the ecdysone biosynthesis pathway are regulated by the dATAC histone acetyltransferase complex in Drosophila,20584983,10.1128/MCB.00142-10,"Uncovering mechanisms that regulate ecdysone production is an important step toward understanding the regulation of insect metamorphosis and processes in steroid-related pathologies. We report here the transcriptome analysis of Drosophila melanogaster dAda2a and dAda3 mutants, in which subunits of the ATAC acetyltransferase complex are affected. In agreement with the fact that these mutations lead to lethality at the start of metamorphosis, both the ecdysone levels and the ecdysone receptor binding to polytene chromosomes are reduced in these flies. The cytochrome genes (spookier, phantom, disembodied, and shadow) involved in steroid conversion in the ring gland are downregulated, while the gene shade, which is involved in converting ecdysone into its active form in the periphery, is upregulated in these dATAC subunit mutants. Moreover, driven expression of dAda3 at the site of ecdysone synthesis partially rescues dAda3 mutants. Mutants of dAda2b, a subunit of the dSAGA histone acetyltransferase complex, do not share phenotype characteristics and RNA profile alterations with dAda2a mutants, indicating that the ecdysone biosynthesis genes are regulated by dATAC, but not by dSAGA. Thus, we provide one of the first examples of the coordinated regulation of a functionally linked set of genes by the metazoan-specific ATAC complex.",2010,"T Pankotai, C Popescu, D MartÃ­n, B Grau, N Zsindely, L Bodai, L Tora, A FerrÃºs, I Boros, T Pankotai, C Popescu, D MartÃ­n, B Grau, N Zsindely, L Bodai, L Tora, A FerrÃºs, I Boros"
Parameter estimation and inference for stochastic reaction-diffusion systems: application to morphogenesis in D. melanogaster,20219114,10.1186/1752-0509-4-21,"Background:
      
    

    
      Reaction-diffusion systems are frequently used in systems biology to model developmental and signalling processes. In many applications, count numbers of the diffusing molecular species are very low, leading to the need to explicitly model the inherent variability using stochastic methods. Despite their importance and frequent use, parameter estimation for both deterministic and stochastic reaction-diffusion systems is still a challenging problem.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We present a Bayesian inference approach to solve both the parameter and state estimation problem for stochastic reaction-diffusion systems. This allows a determination of the full posterior distribution of the parameters (expected values and uncertainty). We benchmark the method by illustrating it on a simple synthetic experiment. We then test the method on real data about the diffusion of the morphogen Bicoid in Drosophila melanogaster. The results show how the precision with which parameters can be inferred varies dramatically, indicating that the ability to infer full posterior distributions on the parameters can have important experimental design consequences.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility and potential advantages of applying a Bayesian approach to parameter estimation in stochastic reaction-diffusion systems. In particular, the ability to estimate credibility intervals associated with parameter estimates can be precious for experimental design. Further work, however, will be needed to ensure the method can scale up to larger problems.",2010,"Michael A Dewar, Visakan Kadirkamanathan, Manfred Opper, Guido Sanguinetti, Michael A Dewar, Visakan Kadirkamanathan, Manfred Opper, Guido Sanguinetti"
[Simulation of Drosophila aging in silico],21510079,,"One of the main tasks of modern gerontology is isolation of the group of phenomena essential for aging from epiphenomenona accompanying them. The modern methods of simulation modeling may be the proper tool for correct isolation. The point of their application is reproduction of external aging manifestations in silico, and, in the first place, of standard survival curves with the help of the simplest internal mechanism. Such a mechanism seems to be the prime mover of aging. The aging model of one the most popular objects of experimental biology, a fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster created by us (http://winmobile.biz/moton/moto.html), is based on the assumption that the key mechanism of aging is cellularity loss, the speed of which is determined by the parameters of active oxygen forms generation in motoneurons.",2010,"V A Chistiakov, Iu V Denisenko, V A Chistiakov, Iu V Denisenko"
The Rap1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G is required for preservation of larval muscle integrity in Drosophila melanogaster,20209136,10.1371/journal.pone.0009403,"C3G is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and modulator of small G-protein activity, which primarily acts on members of the Rap GTPase subfamily. Via promotion of the active GTP bound conformation of target GTPases, C3G has been implicated in the regulation of multiple cellular and developmental events including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The Drosophila C3G orthologue exhibits a domain organization similar to that of vertebrate C3G. Through deletion of the C3G locus, we have observed that loss of C3G causes semi-lethality, and that escaping adult flies are characterized by a reduction in lifespan and general fitness. In situ hybridization reveals C3G expression in the developing embryonic somatic and visceral muscles, and indeed analysis of C3G mutants suggests essential functions of C3G for normal body wall muscle development during larval stages. C3G mutants display abnormal muscle morphology and attachment, as well as failure to properly localize betaPS integrins to muscle attachment sites. Moreover, we show that C3G stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange on Drosophila Rap GTPases in vitro.

Dietary modulation of Drosophila sleep-wake behaviour,20706579,10.1371/journal.pone.0012062,"Background:
      
    

    
      A complex relationship exists between diet and sleep but despite its impact on human health, this relationship remains uncharacterized and poorly understood. Drosophila melanogaster is an important model for the study of metabolism and behaviour, however the effect of diet upon Drosophila sleep remains largely unaddressed.
    

    
  


        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      Using automated behavioural monitoring, a capillary feeding assay and pharmacological treatments, we examined the effect of dietary yeast and sucrose upon Drosophila sleep-wake behaviour for three consecutive days. We found that dietary yeast deconsolidated the sleep-wake behaviour of flies by promoting arousal from sleep in males and shortening periods of locomotor activity in females. We also demonstrate that arousal from nocturnal sleep exhibits a significant ultradian rhythmicity with a periodicity of 85 minutes. Increasing the dietary sucrose concentration from 5% to 35% had no effect on total sucrose ingestion per day nor any affect on arousal, however it did lengthen the time that males and females remained active. Higher dietary sucrose led to reduced total sleep by male but not female flies. Locomotor activity was reduced by feeding flies Metformin, a drug that inhibits oxidative phosphorylation, however Metformin did not affect any aspects of sleep.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We conclude that arousal from sleep is under ultradian control and regulated in a sex-dependent manner by dietary yeast and that dietary sucrose regulates the length of time that flies sustain periods of wakefulness. These findings highlight Drosophila as an important model with which to understand how diet impacts upon sleep and wakefulness in mammals and humans.",2010,"James H Catterson, Seymour Knowles-Barley, Katherine James, Margarete M S Heck, Anthony J Harmar, Paul S Hartley, James H Catterson, Seymour Knowles-Barley, Katherine James, Margarete M S Heck, Anthony J Harmar, Paul S Hartley"

In a brood pattern analysis, it was observed that in mus309 mutant females, the frequency of single crossovers in the central cv-v interval of the X chromosome was reduced in young females but returned to the level of the wild type control as the females aged. In the proximal v-f interval, the frequency of single crossovers was increased during the entire experimental period. In particular, it was observed that the frequency of double crossovers, as well as the coefficient of coincidence first increased but then gradually decreased, finally reaching the level of the control flies, as the females aged. Map distances increased due to the mus309 mutation in both gene interval studies, but they did not change as the females aged, a result suggesting that the mus309 gene controls the distribution of DSBs to be repaired as crossovers instead of non-crossovers. The results suggest a mechanism for the centromere effect of crossing over in Drosophila, viz the fact the frequency of meiotic crossing over reduces with the age of the female, and that the reduction is more pronounced the closer the interval is to the proximal heterochromatin of the chromosome arm. According to the model suggested, the centromere effect is simply a matter of the balance between different pathways of the repair of the DSBs of DNA.",2010,"Petter Portin, Petter Portin"
Mechanisms of life span extension by rapamycin in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,20074526,10.1016/j.cmet.2009.11.010,"The target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway is a major nutrient-sensing pathway that, when genetically downregulated, increases life span in evolutionarily diverse organisms including mammals.

We show here that feeding rapamycin to adult Drosophila produces the life span extension seen in some TOR mutants. Increase in life span by rapamycin was associated with increased resistance to both starvation and paraquat. Analysis of the underlying mechanisms revealed that rapamycin increased longevity specifically through the TORC1 branch of the TOR pathway, through alterations to both autophagy and translation. Rapamycin could increase life span of weak insulin/Igf signaling (IIS) pathway mutants and of flies with life span maximized by dietary restriction, indicating additional mechanisms.",2010,"Ivana Bjedov, Janne M Toivonen, Fiona Kerr, Cathy Slack, Jake Jacobson, Andrea Foley, Linda Partridge, Ivana Bjedov, Janne M Toivonen, Fiona Kerr, Cathy Slack, Jake Jacobson, Andrea Foley, Linda Partridge"
The splicing factor Prp31 is essential for photoreceptor development in Drosophila,21203973,10.1007/s13238-010-0035-9,"Retinitis pigmentosa is a leading cause of blindness and a progressive retinal disorder, affecting millions of people worldwide. This disease is characterized by photoreceptor degeneration, eventually leading to complete blindness. Autosomal dominant (adRP) has been associated with mutations in at least four ubiquitously expressed genes encoding pre-mRNA splicing factors-Prp3, Prp8, Prp31 and PAP1. Biological function of adRP-associated splicing factor genes and molecular mechanisms by which mutations in these genes cause cell-type specific photoreceptor degeneration in humans remain to be elucidated. To investigate the in vivo function of these adRP-associated splicing factor genes, we examined Drosophila in which expression of fly Prp31 homolog was down-regulated. Sequence analyses show that CG6876 is the likely candidate of Drosophila melanogaster Prp31 homolog (DmPrp31). Predicted peptide sequence for CG6876 shows 57% similarity to the Homo sapiens Prp31 protein (HsPrp31). Reduction of the endogenous Prp31 by RNAi-mediated knockdown specifically in the eye leads to reduction of eye size or complete absence of eyes with remarkable features of photoreceptor degeneration and recapitulates the bimodal expressivity of human Prp31 mutations in adRP patients. Such transgenic DmPrp31RNAi flies provide a useful tool for identifying genetic modifiers or interacting genes for Prp31. Expression of the human Prp31 in these animals leads to a partial rescue of the eye phenotype.

Differential requirement of Salvador-Warts-Hippo pathway members for organ size control in Drosophila melanogaster,20110315,10.1242/dev.042309,"The Salvador-Warts-Hippo (SWH) pathway contains multiple growth-inhibitory proteins that control organ size during development by limiting activity of the Yorkie oncoprotein. Increasing evidence indicates that these growth inhibitors act in a complex network upstream of Yorkie. This complexity is emphasised by the distinct phenotypes of tissue lacking different SWH pathway genes. For example, eye tissue lacking the core SWH pathway components salvador, warts or hippo is highly overgrown and resistant to developmental apoptosis, whereas tissue lacking fat or expanded is not. Here we explore the relative contribution of SWH pathway proteins to organ size control by determining their temporal activity profile throughout Drosophila melanogaster eye development. We show that eye tissue lacking fat, expanded or discs overgrown displays elevated Yorkie activity during the larval growth phase of development, but not in the pupal eye when apoptosis ensues. Fat and Expanded do possess Yorkie-repressive activity in the pupal eye, but loss of fat or expanded at this stage of development can be compensated for by Merlin. Fat appears to repress Yorkie independently of Dachs in the pupal eye, which would contrast with the mode of action of Fat during larval development. Fat is more likely to restrict Yorkie activity in the pupal eye together with Expanded, given that pupal eye tissue lacking both these genes resembles that of tissue lacking either gene. This study highlights the complexity employed by different SWH pathway proteins to control organ size at different stages of development.",2010,"Claire C Milton, Xiaomeng Zhang, Nathaniel O Albanese, Kieran F Harvey, Claire C Milton, Xiaomeng Zhang, Nathaniel O Albanese, Kieran F Harvey"
A molecularly defined duplication set for the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster,20876565,10.1534/genetics.110.121285,"We describe a molecularly defined duplication kit for the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster. A set of 408 overlapping P[acman] BAC clones was used to create small duplications (average length 88 kb) covering the 22-Mb sequenced portion of the chromosome. The BAC clones were inserted into an attP docking site on chromosome 3L using Î¦C31 integrase, allowing direct comparison of different transgenes. The insertions complement 92% of the essential and viable mutations and deletions tested, demonstrating that almost all Drosophila genes are compact and that the current annotations of the genome are reasonably accurate. Moreover, almost all genes are tolerated at twice the normal dosage. Finally, we more precisely mapped two regions at which duplications cause diplo-lethality in males. This collection comprises the first molecularly defined duplication set to cover a whole chromosome in a multicellular organism.

Reciprocal analysis of Francisella novicida infections of a Drosophila melanogaster model reveal host-pathogen conflicts mediated by reactive oxygen and imd-regulated innate immune response,20865166,10.1371/journal.ppat.1001065,"The survival of a bacterial pathogen within a host depends upon its ability to outmaneuver the host immune response. Thus, mutant pathogens provide a useful tool for dissecting host-pathogen relationships, as the strategies the microbe has evolved to counteract immunity reveal a host's immune mechanisms. In this study, we examined the pathogen Francisella novicida and identified new bacterial virulence factors that interact with different parts of the Drosophila melanogaster innate immune system. We performed a genome-wide screen to identify F. novicida genes required for growth and survival within the fly and identified a set of 149 negatively selected mutants. Among these, we identified a class of genes including the transcription factor oxyR, and the DNA repair proteins uvrB, recB, and ruvC that help F. novicida resist oxidative stress. We determined that these bacterial genes are virulence factors that allow F. novicida to counteract the fly melanization immune response. We then performed a second in vivo screen to identify an additional subset of bacterial genes that interact specifically with the imd signaling pathway. Most of these mutants have decreased resistance to the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B. Characterization of a mutation in the putative transglutaminase FTN_0869 produced a curious result that could not easily be explained using known Drosophila immune responses. By using an unbiased genetic screen, these studies provide a new view of the Drosophila immune response from the perspective of a pathogen. We show that two branches of the fly's immunity are important for fighting F. novicida infections in a model host: melanization and an imd-regulated immune response, and identify bacterial genes that specifically counteract these host responses. Our work suggests that there may be more to learn about the fly immune system, as not all of the phenotypes we observe can be readily explained by its interactions with known immune responses.",2010,"Madeleine G Moule, Denise M Monack, David S Schneider, Madeleine G Moule, Denise M Monack, David S Schneider"
Chromosome axis defects induce a checkpoint-mediated delay and interchromosomal effect on crossing over during Drosophila meiosis,20711363,10.1371/journal.pgen.1001059,"Crossovers mediate the accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The widely conserved pch2 gene of Drosophila melanogaster is required for a pachytene checkpoint that delays prophase progression when genes necessary for DSB repair and crossover formation are defective. However, the underlying process that the pachytene checkpoint is monitoring remains unclear. Here we have investigated the relationship between chromosome structure and the pachytene checkpoint and show that disruptions in chromosome axis formation, caused by mutations in axis components or chromosome rearrangements, trigger a pch2-dependent delay. Accordingly, the global increase in crossovers caused by chromosome rearrangements, known as the ""interchromosomal effect of crossing over,"" is also dependent on pch2. Checkpoint-mediated effects require the histone deacetylase Sir2, revealing a conserved functional connection between PCH2 and Sir2 in monitoring meiotic events from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a metazoan. These findings suggest a model in which the pachytene checkpoint monitors the structure of chromosome axes and may function to promote an optimal number of crossovers.",2010,"Eric F Joyce, Kim S McKim, Eric F Joyce, Kim S McKim"
Evolution of insect development: to the hemimetabolous paradigm,20462751,10.1016/j.gde.2010.04.005,"Mechanisms of insect development have been extensively studied in Drosophila melanogaster, a holometabolous insect. However, recent studies on other insects have gradually revealed that there exist new developmental paradigms. In this review, we focus on the new hemimetabolous paradigm. We highlight how hemimetabolous short-germ or intermediate-germ embryos establish the anterior/posterior (A/P) pattern and the importance of dynamic cell movement during germband formation. In hemimetabolous insects, orthodenticle, encoding a homeodomain-containing transcription factor, and wingless/Wnt signaling could play crucial roles in the A/P pattern formation. We also discuss recent evidence suggesting that insect developmental modes may have evolved by heterochronic shifts, while retaining certain universal metazoan features.",2010,"Taro Mito, Taro Nakamura, Sumihare Noji, Taro Mito, Taro Nakamura, Sumihare Noji"
Insights into aging through measurements of the Drosophila proteome as a function of temperature,20732347,10.1016/j.mad.2010.08.004,"Drosophila melanogaster is used as a model system to investigate protein changes associated with the aging process under conditions that alter organism lifespan.

Peptide hits detected from strong-cation-exchange and reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry analysis are employed to examine patterns in relative protein expression. Thirty-three proteins were identified as having similar patterns of expression at both temperatures investigated when scaling the organism age to lifespan. In addition, the proteins ferritin 2 light chain homologue and larval serum protein 1Î² were identified in relatively high abundance and displayed distinctly different patterns of expression between the two temperatures.

A role for S6 kinase and serotonin in postmating dietary switch and balance of nutrients in D. melanogaster,20471266,10.1016/j.cub.2010.04.009,"Balancing intake of diverse nutrients is important for organismal growth, reproduction, and survival. A shift in an organism's optimal diet due to changes in nutritional requirements after developmental or environmental changes is referred to as dietary switch and has been observed in several species. Here we demonstrate that female Drosophila melanogaster also undergo a dietary switch following mating that leads to an increased preference for yeast, the major source of protein in their diet. We also demonstrate that S6 kinase (S6K) and serotonin production are involved in the postmating dietary switch. To further investigate the ability of D. melanogaster to balance nutrient intake, we examined the dietary preferences of adult flies following deprivation of yeast or sucrose. We observe that following conditioning on a diet deficient in either carbohydrates or yeast, D. melanogaster show a strong preference for the deficient nutrient. Furthermore, flies with activated dS6K or flies fed a serotonin precursor exhibit enhanced preference for yeast in this assay. Our results suggest that TOR signaling and serotonin may play an important role in maintaining nutrient balance in D. melanogaster. These studies may contribute to our understanding of metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes.",2010,"Misha A Vargas, Ningguang Luo, Atsushi Yamaguchi, Pankaj Kapahi, Misha A Vargas, Ningguang Luo, Atsushi Yamaguchi, Pankaj Kapahi"

We used third-stage larvae of D. melanogaster from a standard cross and a high bioactivation cross and tested 10 different doses of P. coriacea aqueous extract (5, 15, 25, 35, 50, 65, 80, 95, 110, and 125 mg/mL).

However, a significant decrease in the frequency of spots induced by doxorubicin was observed when administered with P. coriacea aqueous extract at these same doses.

Effect of the gene transformer of Anastrepha on the somatic sexual development of Drosophila,20209435,10.1387/ijdb.092917fr,"The gene transformer (tra) is the key regulatory memory device for sex determination in tephritid insects. The present manuscript addressed the question about the functional conservation of the tephritid Anastrepha Transformer protein to direct somatic sexual development in Drosophila (Drosophilidae). The transformer cDNA of Anastrepha encoding the putative full-length Tra protein was cloned in pUAST and introduced into Drosophila melanogaster. To express this protein, the GAL4-UAS system was used. The Anastrepha Tra protein induced the female-specific splicing of both dsx and fru pre-mRNAs in Drosophila XY male flies, so that these became transformed into females, though this transformation was incomplete (the sexually dimorphic foreleg basitarsus and the external terminalia were monitored). It was found that the degree of female transformation directly depended on the dose of Anastrepha tra and Drosophila transformer-2 (tra-2) genes, and that the Anastrepha Tra-Drosophila Tra2 complex is not as efficient as the Drosophila Tra-Tra2 complex at inducing the female-specific splicing of Drosophila dsx pre-mRNA. This can explain why the Anastrepha Tra protein cannot fully substitute for the endogenous Drosophila Tra protein.",2010,"MarÃ­a-Fernanda Ruiz, Lucas SÃ¡nchez, MarÃ­a-Fernanda Ruiz, Lucas SÃ¡nchez"
Dopamine down-regulates activity of alkaline phosphatase in Drosophila: the role of D2-like receptors,20303975,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.03.014,"The effect of a rise in dopamine (DA) level as a result of a mutation, stress or pharmacological treatment on the activity of the enzyme of its synthesis, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in females of Drosophila virilis and Drosophila melanogaster has been studied. It has been found that regardless of its nature, a rise in DA level has a negative effect on ALP activity, which indicates that DA down-regulates activity of the enzyme. The effects of bromocriptine (an agonist of Drosophila dopamine 2-like receptor (DD2R)) on ALP activity have been studied. ALP activity was found to drop in response to bromocriptine in flies. Conversely ALP activity was increased in flies with reduced DD2R expression (i.e. Actin5C-Gal4>UAS-ds-DD2R RNA-interference flies) vs. corresponding controls (i.e. Actin5C-Gal4>w1118 flies). Bromocriptine treatment of RNAi flies rescues ALP activity to the level typical of Actin5C-Gal4>w1118 flies. A change in DD2R number or availability was found not to prevent the response of ALP to heat stress, but to change the intensity of its response to the stress exposure.

Here, we use line-cross analysis to investigate the genetic architecture of wing size divergences at varying spatial scales along a body size cline in Drosophila melanogaster. Our results revealed that divergences in wing size along the cline were due to strong additive effects. Significant nonadditive genetic effects, including epistasis and maternal effects, were also detected, but they were relatively minor in comparison to the additive effects and none were common to all crosses. There was no evidence of increased epistasis in crosses between more geographically distant populations and, unlike in previous studies, we found no significant dominance effects on wing size in any cross. Our results suggest there is little variation in the genetic control of wing size along the length of the Australian cline. They also highlight marked inconsistencies in the magnitude of dominance effects across studies, which may reflect different opportunities for mutation accumulation while lines are in laboratory culture.",2010,"W Jason Kennington, Ary A Hoffmann, W Jason Kennington, Ary A Hoffmann"

We sequenced the complete genomes of DObsSV and DMelSV, and the L gene from DAffSV. Combining these data with sequences from a wide range of other rhabdoviruses, we found that the three sigma viruses form a distinct clade which is a sister group to the Dimarhabdovirus supergroup, and the high levels of divergence between these viruses suggest that they deserve to be recognized as a new genus. Furthermore, our analysis produced the most robustly supported phylogeny of the Rhabdoviridae to date, allowing us to reconstruct the major transitions that have occurred during the evolution of the family. Our data suggest that the bias towards research into plants and vertebrates means that much of the diversity of rhabdoviruses has been missed, and rhabdoviruses may be common pathogens of insects.",2010,"Ben Longdon, Darren J Obbard, Francis M Jiggins, Ben Longdon, Darren J Obbard, Francis M Jiggins"

A comparative study of the short term cold resistance response in distantly related Drosophila species: the role of regucalcin and frost,21991316,10.1371/journal.pone.0025520,"The molecular basis of short term cold resistance (indexed as chill-coma recovery time) has been mostly addressed in D. melanogaster, where candidate genes (Dca (also known as smp-30) and Frost (Fst)) have been identified. Nevertheless, in Drosophila, the ability to tolerate short term exposure to low temperatures evolved several times independently. Therefore, it is unclear whether variation in the same candidate genes is also responsible for short term cold resistance in distantly related Drosophila species. It should be noted that Dca is a candidate gene for cold resistance in the Sophophora subgenus only, since there is no orthologous gene copy in the Drosophila subgenus. Here we show that, in D. americana (Drosophila subgenus), there is a north-south gradient for a variant at the 5' non-coding region of regucalcin (a Dca-like gene; in D. melanogaster the proteins encoded by the two genes share 71.9% amino acid identities) but in our D. americana F2 association experiment there is no association between this polymorphism and chill-coma recovery times. Moreover, we found no convincing evidence that this gene is up-regulated after cold shock in both D. americana and D. melanogaster. Size variation in the Fst PEST domain (putatively involved in rapid protein degradation) is observed when comparing distantly related Drosophila species, and is associated with short term cold resistance differences in D. americana. Nevertheless, this effect is likely through body size variation. Moreover, we show that, even at two hours after cold shock, when up-regulation of this gene is maximal in D. melanogaster (about 48 fold expression change), in D. americana this gene is only moderately up-regulated (about 3 fold expression change).

Towards a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between sex-biased gene expression and rates of protein-coding sequence evolution,21239389,10.1093/molbev/msr010,"Genes that are differentially expressed between the sexes (sex-biased genes) are among the fastest evolving genes in animal genomes. The majority of sex-biased expression is attributable to genes that are primarily expressed in sex-limited reproductive tissues, and these reproductive genes are often rapidly evolving because of intra- and intersexual selection pressures. Additionally, studies of multiple taxa have revealed that genes with sex-biased expression are also expressed in a limited number of tissues. This is worth noting because narrowly expressed genes are known to evolve faster than broadly expressed genes. Therefore, it is not clear whether sex-biased genes are rapidly evolving because they have sexually dimorphic expression, because they are expressed in sex-limited reproductive tissues, or because they are narrowly expressed. To determine the extend to which other confounding variables can explain the rapid evolution of sex-biased genes, I analyzed the rates of evolution of sex-biased genes in Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus in light of tissue-specific measures of expression. I find that genes with sex-biased expression in somatic tissues shared by both sexes are often evolving faster than non-sex-biased genes, but this is best explained by the narrow expression profiles of sex-biased genes. Sex-biased genes in sex-limited tissues in D. melanogaster, however, evolve faster than other narrowly expressed genes. Therefore, the rapid evolution of sex-biased genes is limited only to those genes primarily expressed in sex-limited reproductive tissues.",2011,"Richard P Meisel, Richard P Meisel"
Optical quantal analysis of synaptic transmission in wild-type and rab3-mutant Drosophila motor axons,21378971,10.1038/nn.2767,"Synaptic transmission from a neuron to its target cells occurs via neurotransmitter release from dozens to thousands of presynaptic release sites whose strength and plasticity can vary considerably. We report an in vivo imaging method that monitors real-time synaptic transmission simultaneously at many release sites with quantal resolution. We applied this method to the model glutamatergic system of the Drosophila melanogaster larval neuromuscular junction. We find that, under basal conditions, about half of release sites have a very low release probability, but these are interspersed with sites with as much as a 50-fold higher probability. Paired-pulse stimulation depresses high-probability sites, facilitates low-probability sites, and recruits previously silent sites. Mutation of the small GTPase Rab3 substantially increases release probability but still leaves about half of the sites silent. Our findings suggest that basal synaptic strength and short-term plasticity are regulated at the level of release probability at individual sites.",2011,"Einat S Peled, Ehud Y Isacoff, Einat S Peled, Ehud Y Isacoff"

Immunogold labeling combined with confocal fluorescent and ultrastructural analyses have revealed that the Vasa-containing nuage accumulations remain closely associated with the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum throughout their lifetimes. The migration mechanism of the Vasa-positive nuage appears distinct from the microtubule-dependent translocation of oskar ribonucleoprotein complexes.

Drosophila male germline stem cells do not asymmetrically segregate chromosome strands,21325028,10.1242/jcs.079798,"Adult stem cells continuously supply differentiated cells throughout the life of organisms. This increases the risk of replicative senescence or neoplastic transformation due to mutations that accumulate over many rounds of DNA replication. The immortal strand hypothesis proposes that stem cells reduce the accumulation of replication-induced mutations by retaining the older template DNA strands. Other models have also been proposed in which stem cells asymmetrically segregate chromosome strands for other reasons, such as retention of epigenetic memories. Recently, the idea has emerged that the mother centrosome, which is stereotypically retained within some asymmetrically dividing stem cells, might be utilized as a means of asymmetrically segregating chromosome strands. We have tested this hypothesis in germline stem cells (GSCs) from Drosophila melanogaster testis, which undergo asymmetric divisions marked by the asymmetric segregation of centrosomes and the acquisition of distinct daughter cell fates (stem cell self-renewal versus differentiation). Using 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine labeling combined with direct visualization of GSC-gonialblast (differentiating daughter) pairs, we directly scored the outcome of chromosome strand segregation. Our data show that, in male GSCs in the Drosophila testis, chromosome strands are not asymmetrically segregated, despite asymmetrically segregating centrosomes. Our data demonstrate that asymmetric centrosome segregation in stem cells does not necessarily lead to asymmetric chromosome strand segregation.",2011,"Swathi Yadlapalli, Jun Cheng, Yukiko M Yamashita, Swathi Yadlapalli, Jun Cheng, Yukiko M Yamashita"

Titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) and silver (Ag) NPs are both found in cosmetics and foods, but their increasing use is of concern due to their ability to be taken up by biological systems. While there are some reports of TiO(2) and Ag NPs affecting complex organisms, their effects on reproduction and development have been largely understudied. Here, the effects of orally administered TiO(2) or Ag NPs on reproduction and development in two different model organisms were investigated. TiO(2) NPs reduced the developmental success of CD-1 mice after a single oral dose of 100 or 1000 mg/kg to dams, resulting in a statistically significant increase in fetal deformities and mortality. Similarly, TiO(2) NP addition to food led to a significant progeny loss in the fruit fly, Drosophila, as shown by a decline in female fecundity. Ag NP administration resulted in an increase in the mortality of fetal mice. Similarly in Drosophila, Ag NP feeding led to a significant decrease in developmental success, but unlike TiO(2) NP treatment, there was no decline in fecundity. The distinct response associated with each type of NP likely reflects differences in NP administration as well as the biology of the particular model. Taken together, however, this study warns that these common NPs could be detrimental to the reproductive and developmental health of both invertebrates and vertebrates.",2011,"Nicola A Philbrook, Louise M Winn, A R M Nabiul Afrooz, Navid B Saleh, Virginia K Walker, Nicola A Philbrook, Louise M Winn, A R M Nabiul Afrooz, Navid B Saleh, Virginia K Walker"

Genetic and biochemical approaches have identified the factors involved and revealed mechanisms of action that are unique to male germ cells. In a well-studied example, cofactors and pathways distinct from those used in somatic tissues mediate the action of CREM in male germ cells.

Structural and functional analysis of the repressor complex in the Notch signaling pathway of Drosophila melanogaster,21737682,10.1091/mbc.E11-05-0420,"In metazoans, the highly conserved Notch pathway drives cellular specification. On receptor activation, the intracellular domain of Notch assembles a transcriptional activator complex that includes the DNA-binding protein CSL, a composite of human C-promoter binding factor 1, Suppressor of Hairless of Drosophila melanogaster [Su(H)], and lin-12 and Glp-1 phenotype of Caenorhabditis elegans. In the absence of ligand, CSL represses Notch target genes. However, despite the structural similarity of CSL orthologues, repression appears largely diverse between organisms. Here we analyze the Notch repressor complex in Drosophila, consisting of the fly CSL protein, Su(H), and the corepressor Hairless, which recruits general repressor proteins. We show that the C-terminal domain of Su(H) is necessary and sufficient for forming a high-affinity complex with Hairless. Mutations in Su(H) that affect interactions with Notch and Mastermind have no effect on Hairless binding. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that Notch and Hairless compete for CSL in vitro and in cell culture. In addition, we identify a site in Hairless that is crucial for binding Su(H) and subsequently show that this Hairless mutant is strongly impaired, failing to properly assemble the repressor complex in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate Hairless-mediated inhibition of Notch signaling in a cell culture assay, which hints at a potentially similar repression mechanism in mammals that might be exploited for therapeutic purposes.",2011,"Dieter Maier, Patricia Kurth, Adriana Schulz, Andrew Russell, Zhenyu Yuan, Kim Gruber, Rhett A Kovall, Anette Preiss, Dieter Maier, Patricia Kurth, Adriana Schulz, Andrew Russell, Zhenyu Yuan, Kim Gruber, Rhett A Kovall, Anette Preiss"

Drosophila cellular immunity: a story of migration and adhesion,21502134,10.1242/jcs.064592,"Research during the past 15 years has led to significant breakthroughs, providing evidence of a high degree of similarity between insect and mammalian innate immune responses, both humoural and cellular, and highlighting Drosophila melanogaster as a model system for studying the evolution of innate immunity. In a manner similar to cells of the mammalian monocyte and macrophage lineage, Drosophila immunosurveillance cells (haemocytes) have a number of roles. For example, they respond to wound signals, are involved in wound healing and contribute to the coagulation response. Moreover, they participate in the phagocytosis and encapsulation of invading pathogens, are involved in the removal of apoptotic bodies and produce components of the extracellular matrix. There are several reasons for using the Drosophila cellular immune response as a model to understand cell signalling during adhesion and migration in vivo: many genes involved in the regulation of Drosophila haematopoiesis and cellular immunity have been maintained across taxonomic groups ranging from flies to humans, many aspects of Drosophila and mammalian innate immunity seem to be conserved, and Drosophila is a simplified and well-studied genetic model system. In the present Commentary, we will discuss what is known about cellular adhesion and migration in the Drosophila cellular immune response, during both embryonic and larval development, and where possible compare it with related mechanisms in vertebrates.",2011,"Marie-Odile Fauvarque, Michael J Williams, Marie-Odile Fauvarque, Michael J Williams"
MU2 and HP1a regulate the recognition of double strand breaks in Drosophila melanogaster,21966530,10.1371/journal.pone.0025439,"Chromatin structure regulates the dynamics of the recognition and repair of DNA double strand breaks; open chromatin enhances the recruitment of DNA damage response factors, while compact chromatin is refractory to the assembly of radiation-induced repair foci. MU2, an orthologue of human MDC1, a scaffold for ionizing radiation-induced repair foci, is a widely distributed chromosomal protein in Drosophila melanogaster that moves to DNA repair foci after irradiation. Here we show using yeast 2 hybrid screens and co-immunoprecipitation that MU2 binds the chromoshadow domain of the heterochromatin protein HP1 in untreated cells. We asked what role HP1 plays in the formation of repair foci and cell cycle control in response to DNA damage. After irradiation repair foci form in heterochromatin but are shunted to the edge of heterochromatic regions an HP1-dependent manner, suggesting compartmentalized repair. Hydroxyurea-induced repair foci that form at collapsed replication forks, however, remain in the heterochromatic compartment. HP1a depletion in irradiated imaginal disc cells increases apoptosis and disrupts G2/M arrest. Further, cells irradiated in mitosis produced more and brighter repair foci than to cells irradiated during interphase. Thus, the interplay between MU2 and HP1a is dynamic and may be different in euchromatin and heterochromatin during DNA break recognition and repair.",2011,"Raghuvar Dronamraju, James M Mason, Raghuvar Dronamraju, James M Mason"
Brain development in the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti: a comparative immunocytochemical analysis using cross-reacting antibodies from Drosophila melanogaster,21956584,10.1007/s00427-011-0376-2,"Considerable effort has been directed towards understanding the organization and function of peripheral and central nervous system of disease vector mosquitoes such as Aedes aegypti. To date, all of these investigations have been carried out on adults but none of the studies addressed the development of the nervous system during the larval and pupal stages in mosquitoes. Here, we first screen a set of 30 antibodies, which have been used to study brain development in Drosophila, and identify 13 of them cross-reacting and labeling epitopes in the developing brain of Aedes. We then use the identified antibodies in immunolabeling studies to characterize general neuroanatomical features of the developing brain and compare them with the well-studied model system, Drosophila melanogaster, in larval, pupal, and adult stages. Furthermore, we use immunolabeling to document the development of specific components of the Aedes brain, namely the optic lobes, the subesophageal neuropil, and serotonergic system of the subesophageal neuropil in more detail. Our study reveals prominent differences in the developing brain in the larval stage as compared to the pupal (and adult) stage of Aedes. The results also uncover interesting similarities and marked differences in brain development of Aedes as compared to Drosophila.

In the Abd-B regulatory region, three insulators were identified, including Fab-7 and Fab-8, which flanked the iab-7domain, and Mcp, which separated the Abd-B and abd-A regulatory regions. It was suggested that boundary insulators formed a barrier between active and repressed chromatin.

Conservation of fruitless' role as master regulator of male courtship behaviour from cockroaches to flies,21340608,10.1007/s00427-011-0352-x,"In Drosophila melanogaster, male courtship behaviour is regulated by the fruitless gene. In D. melanogaster, fruitless encodes a set of putative transcription factors that are sex-specifically spliced. Male-specific variants are necessary and sufficient to elicit male courtship behaviour. Fruitless sequences have been reported in other insect species, but there are no data available on their functional role. In the present work, we cloned and sequenced fruitless in males of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, and we studied its expression in male brain and testes. B. germanica fruitless encodes a 350-amino acid protein with BTB and Zinc finger domains typical of fruitless sequences. Upon RNAi-mediated knockdown of fruitless in B. germanica, males no longer exhibit courtship behaviour, thus implying that fruitless is necessary for male sexual behaviour in our cockroach model.

Genome-wide deficiency screen for the genomic regions responsible for heat resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,21696597,10.1186/1471-2156-12-57,"Background:
      
    

    
      Temperature adaptation is one of the most important determinants of distribution and population size of organisms in nature. Recently, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and gene expression profiling approaches have been used for detecting candidate genes for heat resistance. However, the resolution of QTL mapping is not high enough to examine the individual effects of various genes in each QTL. Heat stress-responsive genes, characterized by gene expression profiling studies, are not necessarily responsible for heat resistance. Some of these genes may be regulated in association with the heat stress response of other genes.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      To evaluate which heat-responsive genes are potential candidates for heat resistance with higher resolution than previous QTL mapping studies, we performed genome-wide deficiency screen for QTL for heat resistance. We screened 439 isogenic deficiency strains from the DrosDel project, covering 65.6% of the Drosophila melanogaster genome in order to map QTL for thermal resistance. As a result, we found 19 QTL for heat resistance, including 3 novel QTL outside the QTL found in previous studies.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The QTL found in this study encompassed 19 heat-responsive genes found in the previous gene expression profiling studies, suggesting that they were strong candidates for heat resistance. This result provides new insights into the genetic architecture of heat resistance. It also emphasizes the advantages of genome-wide deficiency screen using isogenic deficiency libraries.",2011,"Kazuo H Takahashi, Yasukazu Okada, Kouhei Teramura, Kazuo H Takahashi, Yasukazu Okada, Kouhei Teramura"

Drosophila melanogaster as an animal model for the study of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm infections in vivo,21998591,10.1371/journal.ppat.1002299,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen capable of causing both acute and chronic infections in susceptible hosts. Chronic P. aeruginosa infections are thought to be caused by bacterial biofilms. Biofilms are highly structured, multicellular, microbial communities encased in an extracellular matrix that enable long-term survival in the host. The aim of this research was to develop an animal model that would allow an in vivo study of P. aeruginosa biofilm infections in a Drosophila melanogaster host. At 24 h post oral infection of Drosophila, P. aeruginosa biofilms localized to and were visualized in dissected Drosophila crops. These biofilms had a characteristic aggregate structure and an extracellular matrix composed of DNA and exopolysaccharide. P. aeruginosa cells recovered from in vivo grown biofilms had increased antibiotic resistance relative to planktonically grown cells. In vivo, biofilm formation was dependent on expression of the pel exopolysaccharide genes, as a pelB::lux mutant failed to form biofilms. The pelB::lux mutant was significantly more virulent than PAO1, while a hyperbiofilm strain (PAZHI3) demonstrated significantly less virulence than PAO1, as indicated by survival of infected flies at day 14 postinfection. Biofilm formation, by strains PAO1 and PAZHI3, in the crop was associated with induction of diptericin, cecropin A1 and drosomycin antimicrobial peptide gene expression 24 h postinfection. In contrast, infection with the non-biofilm forming strain pelB::lux resulted in decreased AMP gene expression in the fly. In summary, these results provide novel insights into host-pathogen interactions during P. aeruginosa oral infection of Drosophila and highlight the use of Drosophila as an infection model that permits the study of P. aeruginosa biofilms in vivo.",2011,"Heidi Mulcahy, Christopher D Sibley, Michael G Surette, Shawn Lewenza, Heidi Mulcahy, Christopher D Sibley, Michael G Surette, Shawn Lewenza"
A link between impaired purine nucleotide synthesis and apoptosis in Drosophila melanogaster,21441212,10.1534/genetics.110.124222,"The biosynthetic pathways and multiple functions of purine nucleotides are well known. However, the pathways that respond to alterations in purine nucleotide synthesis in vivo in an animal model organism have not been identified. We examined the effects of inhibiting purine de novo synthesis in vivo and in cultured cells of Drosophila melanogaster. The purine de novo synthesis gene ade2 encodes phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (EC 6.3.5.3). An ade2 deletion, generated by P-element transposon excision, causes lethality in early pupal development, with darkening, or necrosis, of leg and wing imaginal disc tissue upon disc eversion. Together with analysis of a previously isolated weaker allele, ade2(4), and an allele of the Prat gene, which encodes an enzyme for the first step in the pathway, we determined that the lethal arrest and imaginal disc phenotypes involve apoptosis. A transgene expressing the baculovirus caspase inhibitor p35, which suppresses apoptosis caused by other stresses such as DNA damage, suppresses both the imaginal disc tissue darkening and the pupal lethality of all three purine de novo synthesis mutants. Furthermore, we showed the presence of apoptosis at the cellular level in both ade2 and Prat mutants by detecting TUNEL-positive nuclei in wing imaginal discs. Purine de novo synthesis inhibition was also examined in tissue culture by ade2 RNA interference followed by analysis of genome-wide changes in transcript levels. Among the upregulated genes was HtrA2, which encodes an apoptosis effector and is thus a candidate for initiating apoptosis in response to purine depletion.",2011,"Catherine Holland, David B Lipsett, Denise V Clark, Catherine Holland, David B Lipsett, Denise V Clark"
Static magnetic field modulates rhythmic activities of a cluster of large local interneurons in Drosophila antennal lobe,21775714,10.1152/jn.00067.2011,"With the development of superconducting magnets, the chances of exposure to intense static magnetic fields (SMFs) have increased. Therefore, safety concerns related to magnetic field exposure need to be studied, especially the effects of magnetic field exposure on the central nervous system. Only a limited number of studies prove a direct connection between magnetic fields and electrophysiological signal processing. Here we described a cluster of large local interneurons (LNs) located laterally to each antennal lobe of Drosophila melanogaster, which exhibit extensive arborizations throughout the whole antennal lobe. Dual recordings showed that these large LNs demonstrated rhythmic spontaneous activities that correlated with other LNs and projection neurons (PNs) in the olfactory circuit. The results suggest that 3.0-T SMF can interfere with the properties of the action potential, rhythmic spontaneous activities of large LNs, and correlated activity in pairs of ipsilateral large LN/LN in the olfactory circuit.

The bicoid stability factor controls polyadenylation and expression of specific mitochondrial mRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster,22022283,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002324,"The bicoid stability factor (BSF) of Drosophila melanogaster has been reported to be present in the cytoplasm, where it stabilizes the maternally contributed bicoid mRNA and binds mRNAs expressed from early zygotic genes. BSF may also have other roles, as it is ubiquitously expressed and essential for survival of adult flies. We have performed immunofluorescence and cell fractionation analyses and show here that BSF is mainly a mitochondrial protein. We studied two independent RNAi knockdown fly lines and report that reduced BSF protein levels lead to a severe respiratory deficiency and delayed development at the late larvae stage. Ubiquitous knockdown of BSF results in a severe reduction of the polyadenylation tail lengths of specific mitochondrial mRNAs, accompanied by an enrichment of unprocessed polycistronic RNA intermediates. Furthermore, we observed a significant reduction in mRNA steady state levels, despite increased de novo transcription. Surprisingly, mitochondrial de novo translation is increased and abnormal mitochondrial translation products are present in knockdown flies, suggesting that BSF also has a role in coordinating the mitochondrial translation in addition to its role in mRNA maturation and stability. We thus report a novel function of BSF in flies and demonstrate that it has an important intra-mitochondrial role, which is essential for maintaining mtDNA gene expression and oxidative phosphorylation.",2011,"Ana Bratic, Anna Wredenberg, Sebastian GrÃ¶nke, James B Stewart, Arnaud Mourier, Benedetta Ruzzenente, Christian Kukat, Rolf Wibom, Bianca Habermann, Linda Partridge, Nils-GÃ¶ran Larsson, Ana Bratic, Anna Wredenberg, Sebastian GrÃ¶nke, James B Stewart, Arnaud Mourier, Benedetta Ruzzenente, Christian Kukat, Rolf Wibom, Bianca Habermann, Linda Partridge, Nils-GÃ¶ran Larsson"
Pre-fibrillar Î±-synuclein mutants cause Parkinson's disease-like non-motor symptoms in Drosophila,21931820,10.1371/journal.pone.0024701,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is linked to the formation of insoluble fibrillar aggregates of the presynaptic protein Î±-Synuclein (Î±S) in neurons. The appearance of such aggregates coincides with severe motor deficits in human patients. These deficits are often preceded by non-motor symptoms such as sleep-related problems in the patients. PD-like motor deficits can be recapitulated in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster when Î±S is pan-neurally expressed. Interestingly, both these deficits are more severe when Î±S mutants with reduced aggregation properties are expressed in flies. This indicates that that Î±S aggregation is not the primary cause of the PD-like motor symptoms. Here we describe a model for PD in Drosophila which utilizes the targeted expression of Î±S mutants in a subset of dopadecarboxylase expressing serotonergic and dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Our results show that targeted expression of pre-fibrillar Î±S mutants not only recapitulates PD-like motor symptoms but also the preceding non-motor symptoms such as an abnormal sleep-like behavior, altered locomotor activity and abnormal circadian periodicity. Further, the results suggest that the observed non-motor symptoms in flies are caused by an early impairment of neuronal functions rather than by the loss of neurons due to cell death.",2011,"Madhu Babu Gajula Balija, Christian Griesinger, Alf Herzig, Markus Zweckstetter, Herbert JÃ¤ckle, Madhu Babu Gajula Balija, Christian Griesinger, Alf Herzig, Markus Zweckstetter, Herbert JÃ¤ckle"

Successive increases in the resistance of Drosophila to viral infection through a transposon insertion followed by a Duplication,22028673,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002337,"To understand the molecular basis of how hosts evolve resistance to their parasites, we have investigated the genes that cause variation in the susceptibility of Drosophila melanogaster to viral infection. Using a host-specific pathogen of D. melanogaster called the sigma virus (Rhabdoviridae), we mapped a major-effect polymorphism to a region containing two paralogous genes called CHKov1 and CHKov2. In a panel of inbred fly lines, we found that a transposable element insertion in the protein coding sequence of CHKov1 is associated with increased resistance to infection. Previous research has shown that this insertion results in a truncated messenger RNA that encodes a far shorter protein than the susceptible allele. This resistant allele has rapidly increased in frequency under directional selection and is now the commonest form of the gene in natural populations. Using genetic mapping and site-specific recombination, we identified a third genotype with considerably greater resistance that is currently rare in the wild. In these flies there have been two duplications, resulting in three copies of both the truncated allele of CHKov1 and CHKov2 (one of which is also truncated). Remarkably, the truncated allele of CHKov1 has previously been found to confer resistance to organophosphate insecticides. As estimates of the age of this allele predate the use of insecticides, it is likely that this allele initially functioned as a defence against viruses and fortuitously ""pre-adapted"" flies to insecticides. These results demonstrate that strong selection by parasites for increased host resistance can result in major genetic changes and rapid shifts in allele frequencies; and, contrary to the prevailing view that resistance to pathogens can be a costly trait to evolve, the pleiotropic effects of these changes can have unexpected benefits.",2011,"Michael M Magwire, Florian Bayer, Claire L Webster, Chuan Cao, Francis M Jiggins, Michael M Magwire, Florian Bayer, Claire L Webster, Chuan Cao, Francis M Jiggins"
The Dca gene involved in cold adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster arose by duplication of the ancestral regucalcin gene,21339509,10.1093/molbev/msr040,"The Drosophila cold acclimation gene (Dca) is involved in the adaptive response to low temperatures. This gene is upregulated at the transcriptional level when D. melanogaster flies are exposed 1 day to 15 Â°C. Dca (or smp-30) is a member of the SMP-30/Gluconolactonase/LRE-like family. In the current study, we characterized the members of this gene family in the 12 Drosophila species with available complete genomes sequences. Two paralogous genes, Dca and regucalcin, were identified in all the Sophophora subgenus species (9 of the 12 species), and their presence was further confirmed in three other species of the subgenus (D. subobscura, D. madeirensis, and D. guanche). However, only regucalcin was present in the species of the Drosophila subgenus (D. grimshawi, D. virilis, and D. mojavensis). The phylogenetic analysis and the molecular organization of Dca that is a nested intronic gene support that Dca arose by a duplication event from the ancestral regucalcin gene after the split of the Sophophora and Drosophila subgenera but before the Sophophora radiation. After the duplication event, the nonsynonymous fixation rate increased in the branch leading to Dca (but not to regucalcin), suggesting the neofunctionalization of the former duplicate. Thus, regucalcin would have maintained the ancestral gene function, and Dca would have acquired a new function likely related to CaÂ²??homeostasis and cold acclimation. Molecular evolution of Dca has been affected by its implication in the adaptive response to cold temperatures. Indeed, the gene has evolved under stronger purifying selection in the temperate than in the tropical Sophophora species, as reflected by the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions. This result is consistent with functional constraints acting on the DCA protein to keep species adaptation to temperate climates. Dca and regucalcin also differ in their expression patterns. The expression profile of regucalcin is similar to that of the anterior fat body protein gene (AFP) of Sarcophaga peregrina and Calliphora vicina, which is also a member of the SMP-30/Gluconolactonase/LRE-like gene family.

Here we show that the whole conserved region around the DHHS sequence, which is essential for palmitoylation in DHHC proteins, is not required for GABPI to interact with Î²4GalNAcTB. In contrast, the two luminal loops between transmembrane domain 3-4 and 5-6 contain conserved amino acids, which are crucial for activity. Besides the dependence on GABPI, Î²4GalNAcTB requires its exceptional short stem region for activity. A few hydrophobic amino acids positioned close to the transmembrane domain are essential for the interaction with GABPI. Along with its catalytic domain, Î²4GalNAcTB, thus, requires an area in its own stem region and two small luminal loops of GABPI as ""add-on"" domains.

Here we use next-generation genome sequencing to reexamine the well-studied Australian D. melanogaster cline. We find evidence for extensive differentiation between temperate and tropical populations, with regulatory regions and unannotated regions showing particularly high levels of differentiation. Although the physical genomic scale of geographic differentiation is small--on the order of gene sized--we observed several larger highly differentiated regions. The region spanned by the cosmopolitan inversion polymorphism In(3R)P shows higher levels of differentiation, consistent with the major difference in allele frequencies of Standard and In(3R)P karyotypes in temperate vs. tropical Australian populations.

Here, we describe genetic and biochemical approaches to the study of the Drosophila CHD1 chromodomains. We found that overall localization of CHD1 on polytene chromosomes does not appreciably change in chromodomain-mutant flies. In contrast, the chromodomains are important for transcription-independent activities of CHD1 during early embryonic development as well as for transcriptional regulation of several heat shock genes. However, neither CHD1 nor its chromodomains are needed for RNA polymerase II localization and H3K4 methylation but loss of CHD1 decreases transcription-induced histone eviction at the Hsp70 gene in vivo.

Other gut-associated bacteria included 6 OTUs with low %ID to previously reported sequences, raising the possibility that they represent novel taxa within the genera Acetobacter and Lactobacillus. A developmental change in the most abundant species, from L. fructivorans in young adults to A. pomorum in aged adults was identified; changes in gut oxygen tension or immune system function might account for this effect. Host immune responses and disturbance may also contribute to the low bacterial diversity in the Drosophila gut habitat.",2011,"Chun Nin Adam Wong, Patrick Ng, Angela E Douglas, Chun Nin Adam Wong, Patrick Ng, Angela E Douglas"
Fates-shifted is an F-box protein that targets Bicoid for degradation and regulates developmental fate determination in Drosophila embryos,21170036,10.1038/ncb2141,"Bicoid (Bcd) is a morphogenetic protein that instructs patterning along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis in Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Despite extensive studies, what controls the formation of a normal concentration gradient of Bcd remains an unresolved and controversial question. Here, we show that Bcd protein degradation is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We have identified an F-box protein, encoded by fates-shifted (fsd), that has an important role in Bcd protein degradation by targeting it for ubiquitylation. Embryos from females lacking fsd have an altered Bcd gradient profile, resulting in a shift of the fatemap along the A-P axis. Our study is an experimental demonstration that, contrary to an alternative hypothesis, Bcd protein degradation is required for normal gradient formation and developmental fate determination.",2011,"Junbo Liu, Jun Ma, Junbo Liu, Jun Ma"
Identification of the Drosophila and Tribolium receptors for the recently discovered insect RYamide neuropeptides,21843505,10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.07.131,"One year ago, we discovered a new family of insect RYamide neuropeptides, which has the C-terminal consensus sequence FFXXXRYamide, and which is widely occurring in most insects, including the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster and the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (F. Hauser et al., J. Proteome Res. 9 (2010) 5296-5310). Here, we identify a Drosophila G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) coded for by gene CG5811 and its Tribolium GPCR ortholog as insect RYamide receptors. The Drosophila RYamide receptor is equally well activated (EC(50), 1?10(-9)M) by the two Drosophila RYamide neuropeptides: RYamide-1 (PVFFVASRYamide) and RYamide-2 (NEHFFLGSRYamide), both contained in a preprohormone coded for by gene CG40733. The Tribolium receptor shows a somewhat higher affinity to Tribolium RYamide-2 (ADAFFLGPRYamide; EC(50), 5?10(-9)M) than to Tribolium RYamide-1 (VQNLATFKTMMRYamide; EC(50), 7?10(-8)M), which might be due to the fact that the last peptide does not completely follow the RYamide consensus sequence rule. There are other neuropeptides in insects that have similar C-terminal sequences (RWamide or RFamide), such as the FMRFamides, sulfakinins, myosuppressins, neuropeptides F, and the various short neuropeptides F. Amazingly, these neuropeptides show no cross-reactivity to the Tribolium RYamide receptor, while the Drosophila RYamide receptor is only very slightly activated by high concentrations (>10(-6)M) of neuropeptide F and short neuropeptide F-1, showing that the two RYamide receptors are quite specific for activation by insect RYamides, and that the sequence FFXXXRYamide is needed for effective insect RYamide receptor activation. Phylogenetic tree analyses and other amino acid sequence comparisons show that the insect RYamide receptors are not closely related to any other known insect or invertebrate/vertebrate receptors, including mammalian neuropeptide Y and insect neuropeptide F and short neuropeptide F receptors.

Experiments on induction of mosaic clones in tissues of the larval wing imaginal disc showed that the cell cycle in mutant discs is shorter than that in control. Flow fluorescence cytometry revealed no differences between mutant and normal animals in the relative duration of the cell cycle phases, which suggests proportional shortening of the cell cycle phases. The study with pulse-labeled mitoses confirmed these results and showed that the length of the cell cycle is 7 h (S phase duration 3 h) in control individuals and 5 h (S phase duration 2 h) in Merlin gene mutants.",2011,"T D Dubatolova, N V Dorogova, L V Omel'ianchuk, L-Sh Chang, T D Dubatolova, N V Dorogova, L V Omel'ianchuk, L-Sh Chang"
Evolution of eye morphology and rhodopsin expression in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup,22662147,10.1371/journal.pone.0037346,"A striking diversity of compound eye size and shape has evolved among insects. The number of ommatidia and their size are major determinants of the visual sensitivity and acuity of the compound eye. Each ommatidium is composed of eight photoreceptor cells that facilitate the discrimination of different colours via the expression of various light sensitive Rhodopsin proteins. It follows that variation in eye size, shape, and opsin composition is likely to directly influence vision. We analyzed variation in these three traits in D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. mauritiana. We show that D. mauritiana generally has larger eyes than its sibling species, which is due to a combination of larger ommatidia and more ommatidia. In addition, intra- and inter-specific differences in eye size among D. simulans and D. melanogaster strains are mainly caused by variation in ommatidia number. By applying a geometric morphometrics approach to assess whether the formation of larger eyes influences other parts of the head capsule, we found that an increase in eye size is associated with a reduction in the adjacent face cuticle. Our shape analysis also demonstrates that D. mauritiana eyes are specifically enlarged in the dorsal region. Intriguingly, this dorsal enlargement is associated with enhanced expression of rhodopsin 3 in D. mauritiana. In summary, our data suggests that the morphology and functional properties of the compound eyes vary considerably within and among these closely related Drosophila species and may be part of coordinated morphological changes affecting the head capsule.",2012,"Nico Posnien, Corinna Hopfen, Maarten Hilbrant, Margarita Ramos-Womack, Sophie Murat, Anna SchÃ¶nauer, Samantha L Herbert, Maria D S Nunes, Saad Arif, Casper J Breuker, Christian SchlÃ¶tterer, Philipp Mitteroecker, Alistair P McGregor, Nico Posnien, Corinna Hopfen, Maarten Hilbrant, Margarita Ramos-Womack, Sophie Murat, Anna SchÃ¶nauer, Samantha L Herbert, Maria D S Nunes, Saad Arif, Casper J Breuker, Christian SchlÃ¶tterer, Philipp Mitteroecker, Alistair P McGregor"
Essential role of Drosophila black-pearl is mediated by its effects on mitochondrial respiration,22700875,10.1096/fj.11-193540,"Black-pearl (Blp) is a highly conserved, essential inner-mitochondrial membrane protein. The yeast Blp homologue, Magmas/Pam16, is required for mitochondrial protein transport, growth, and survival. Our purpose was to determine the role of Drosophila Blp in mitochondrial function, cell survival, and proliferation. To this end, we performed mitotic recombination in Drosophila melanogaster, RNAi-mediated knockdown, MitoTracker staining, measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), flow cytometry, electron transport chain complex assays, and hemocyte isolation from Drosophila larvae. Proliferation-defective, Blp-deficient Drosophila Schneider cells exhibited mitochondrial membrane depolarization, a 60% decrease in ATP levels, increased amounts of ROS (3.5-fold), cell cycle arrest, and activation of autophagy that were associated with a selective 65% reduction of cytochrome c oxidase activity. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) rescued Blp-RNAi-treated cells from cell cycle arrest, indicating that increased production of ROS is the primary cause of the proliferation and survival defects in Blp-depleted cells. blp hypomorph larvae had a 35% decreased number of plasmatocytes with a 45% reduced active mitochondrial staining and their viability was increased 2-fold by administration of NAC, which blocked melanotic lesions. Loss of Blp decreases cytochrome c oxidase activity and uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, causing ROS production, which selectively affects mitochondria-rich plasmatocyte survival and function, leading to melanotic lesions in Blp-deficient flies.",2012,"Soumit Roy, Mary K Short, E Richard Stanley, Paul T Jubinsky, Soumit Roy, Mary K Short, E Richard Stanley, Paul T Jubinsky"

Fast PCA for processing calcium-imaging data from the brain of Drosophila melanogaster,22595087,10.1186/1472-6947-12-S1-S2,"Background:
      
    

    
      The calcium-imaging technique allows us to record movies of brain activity in the antennal lobe of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, a brain compartment dedicated to information about odors. Signal processing, e.g. with source separation techniques, can be slow on the large movie datasets.
    

    
  


        Method:
      
    

    
      We have developed an approximate Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for fast dimensionality reduction. The method samples relevant pixels from the movies, such that PCA can be performed on a smaller matrix. Utilising a priori knowledge about the nature of the data, we minimise the risk of missing important pixels.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Our method allows for fast approximate computation of PCA with adaptive resolution and running time. Utilising a priori knowledge about the data enables us to concentrate more biological signals in a small pixel sample than a general sampling method based on vector norms.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Fast dimensionality reduction with approximate PCA removes a computational bottleneck and leads to running time improvements for subsequent algorithms. Once in PCA space, we can efficiently perform source separation, e.g to detect biological signals in the movies or to remove artifacts.",2012,"Martin Strauch, C Giovanni Galizia, Martin Strauch, C Giovanni Galizia"
The effect of deleterious mutations and age on recombination in Drosophila melanogaster,22276549,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01450.x,"At the population level, recombination mediates the efficiency with which selection can eliminate deleterious mutations. At the individual level, deleterious alleles may influence recombination, which would change the rate at which linkage disequilibrium is eroded and thereby alter the efficiency with which deleterious alleles are purged. Here, we test whether the presence of a deleterious allele on one autosome affects recombination on another autosome. We find that deleterious alleles not only alter the rate but also the pattern of recombination. However, there is little support that different deleterious alleles affect recombination in a consistent manner. Because we have detailed information on individual females across their lifetimes, we are able to examine how recombination patterns change with age and find that these patterns are also affected by the presence of deleterious alleles. The differences among genotypes or among age classes are large enough to add substantial noise to genetic mapping experiments that do not consider these sources of variation.",2012,"Katherine Tedman-Aucoin, Aneil F Agrawal, Katherine Tedman-Aucoin, Aneil F Agrawal"

We demonstrate that upon DR, Drosophila melanogaster shift their metabolism toward increasing fatty-acid synthesis and breakdown, which is required for various responses to DR. Inhibition of fatty-acid synthesis or oxidation genes specifically in the muscle tissue inhibited life-span extension upon DR. Furthermore, DR enhances spontaneous activity of flies, which was found to be dependent on the enhanced fatty-acid metabolism. This increase in activity was found to be at least partially required for the life-span extension upon DR. Overexpression of adipokinetic hormone (dAKH), the functional ortholog of glucagon, enhances fat metabolism, spontaneous activity, and life span. Together, these results suggest that enhanced fat metabolism in the muscle and physical activity play a key role in the protective effects of DR.",2012,"Subhash D Katewa, Fabio Demontis, Marysia Kolipinski, Alan Hubbard, Matthew S Gill, Norbert Perrimon, Simon Melov, Pankaj Kapahi, Subhash D Katewa, Fabio Demontis, Marysia Kolipinski, Alan Hubbard, Matthew S Gill, Norbert Perrimon, Simon Melov, Pankaj Kapahi"
Negative regulation of EGFR/MAPK pathway by Pumilio in Drosophila melanogaster,22514614,10.1371/journal.pone.0034016,"In Drosophila melanogaster, specification of wing vein cells and sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells, which later give rise to a bristle, requires EGFR signaling. Here, we show that Pumilio (Pum), an RNA-binding translational repressor, negatively regulates EGFR signaling in wing vein and bristle development. We observed that loss of Pum function yielded extra wing veins and additional bristles. Conversely, overexpression of Pum eliminated wing veins and bristles. Heterozygotes for Pum produced no phenotype on their own, but greatly enhanced phenotypes caused by the enhancement of EGFR signaling. Conversely, over-expression of Pum suppressed the effects of ectopic EGFR signaling. Components of the EGFR signaling pathway are encoded by mRNAs that have Nanos Response Element (NRE)-like sequences in their 3'UTRs; NREs are known to bind Pum to confer regulation in other mRNAs. We show that these NRE-like sequences bind Pum and confer repression on a luciferase reporter in heterologous cells. Taken together, our evidence suggests that Pum functions as a negative regulator of EGFR signaling by directly targeting components of the pathway in Drosophila.",2012,"Sung Yun Kim, Ji Young Kim, Sumira Malik, Wonseok Son, Ki-Sun Kwon, Changsoo Kim, Sung Yun Kim, Ji Young Kim, Sumira Malik, Wonseok Son, Ki-Sun Kwon, Changsoo Kim"
Drosophila lin-52 acts in opposition to repressive components of the Myb-MuvB/dREAM complex,22688510,10.1128/MCB.00432-12,"The Drosophila melanogaster Myb-MuvB/dREAM complex (MMB/dREAM) participates in both the activation and repression of developmentally regulated genes and origins of DNA replication. Mutants in MMB subunits exhibit diverse phenotypes, including lethality, eye defects, reduced fecundity, and sterility. Here, we used P-element excision to generate mutations in lin-52, which encodes the smallest subunit of the MMB/dREAM complex. lin-52 is required for viability, as null mutants die prior to pupariation. The generation of somatic and germ line mutant clones indicates that lin-52 is required for adult eye development and for early embryogenesis via maternal effects. Interestingly, the maternal-effect embryonic lethality, larval lethality, and adult eye defects could be suppressed by mutations in other subunits of the MMB/dREAM complex. These results suggest that a partial MMB/dREAM complex is responsible for the lethality and eye defects of lin-52 mutants. Furthermore, these findings support a model in which the Lin-52 and Myb proteins counteract the repressive activities of the other members of the MMB/dREAM complex at specific genomic loci in a developmentally controlled manner.",2012,"Peter W Lewis, Debashis Sahoo, Cuiyun Geng, Maren Bell, Joseph S Lipsick, Michael R Botchan, Peter W Lewis, Debashis Sahoo, Cuiyun Geng, Maren Bell, Joseph S Lipsick, Michael R Botchan"

In this work, we evaluated the toxicity of monodisperse citrate-capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of different sizes (5, 15, 40, and 80 nm) in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, upon ingestion. To properly evaluate and distinguish the possible dose- and/or size-dependent toxicity of the AuNPs, we performed a thorough assessment of their biological effects, using two different dose-metrics. In the first approach, we kept constant the total surface area of the differently sized AuNPs (Total Exposed Surface area approach, TES), while, in the second approach, we used the same number concentration of the four different sizes of AuNPs (Total Number of Nanoparticles approach, TNN). We observed a significant AuNPs-induced toxicity in vivo, namely a strong reduction of Drosophila lifespan and fertility performance, presence of DNA fragmentation, as well as a significant modification in the expression levels of genes involved in stress responses, DNA damage recognition and apoptosis pathway.

A targeted in vivo RNAi screen reveals deubiquitinases as new regulators of Notch signaling,23275879,10.1534/g3.112.003780,"Notch signaling is highly conserved in all metazoan animals and plays critical roles in cell fate specification, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and stem cell maintenance. Although core components of the Notch signaling cascade have been identified, many gaps in the understanding of the Notch signaling pathway remain to be filled. One form of posttranslational regulation, which is controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, is known to modulate Notch signaling. The ubiquitination pathway is a highly coordinated process in which the ubiquitin moiety is either conjugated to or removed from target proteins by opposing E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases (DUBs). Several E3 ubiquitin ligases have been implicated in ubiquitin conjugation to the receptors and the ligands of the Notch signaling cascade. In contrast, little is known about a direct role of DUBs in Notch signaling in vivo. Here, we report an in vivo RNA interference screen in Drosophila melanogaster targeting all 45 DUBs that we annotated in the fly genome. We show that at least four DUBs function specifically in the formation of the fly wing margin and/or the specification of the scutellar sensory organ precursors, two processes that are strictly dependent on the balanced Notch signaling activity. Furthermore, we provide genetic evidence suggesting that these DUBs are necessary to positively modulate Notch signaling activity.

Consistent with the hypothesis that the nuclear transport pathway is at the heart of mediating genetic conflicts, both nucleoporins and directionality imposing components of nuclear transport have previously been shown to evolve under positive selection. Here, we present a comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of importins (karyopherins) in Drosophila evolution. Importins are adaptor molecules that physically mediate the transport of cargo molecules and comprise the third component of the nuclear transport apparatus. We find that importins have been repeatedly gained and lost throughout various stages of Drosophila evolution, including two intriguing examples of an apparently coincident loss and gain of nonorthologous and noncanonical importin-Î±.

We also show that increased population growth rates at high density can enhance stability, even in the absence of a decrease in r, by ensuring that the crowding adapted populations do not fall to very low sizes. We discuss our results in the context of traits known to have diverged between the selected and control populations, and compare our results with previous work on the evolution of stability in D. melanogaster.

Hyperactive proinflammatory and stress signaling through NF-ÎºB/Relish, Jun N-terminal kinase, and FOXO in atf3 mutants deregulates genes important for immune defense, digestion, and lipid metabolism. Reducing the dose of either FOXO or Relish normalizes both lipid metabolism and gene expression in atf3 mutants.

The propensity for consuming ethanol in Drosophila requires rutabaga adenylyl cyclase expression within mushroom body neurons,22624869,10.1111/j.1601-183X.2012.00810.x,"Alcohol activates reward systems through an unknown mechanism, in some cases leading to alcohol abuse and dependence.

Wild-type Drosophila shows a significant preference for food containing between 5% and 15% ethanol. Preferred ethanol self-administration does not appear to be due to caloric advantage, nor due to perceptual biases, suggesting a hedonic bias for ethanol exists in Drosophila. Interestingly, rutabaga adenylyl cyclase expression within intrinsic mushroom body neurons is necessary for robust ethanol self-administration. The expression of rutabaga in mushroom bodies is also required for both appetitive and aversive olfactory associative memories, suggesting that reinforced behavior has an important role in the ethanol self-administration in Drosophila. However, rutabaga expression is required more broadly within the mushroom bodies for the preference for ethanol-containing food than for olfactory memories reinforced by sugar reward.

This is particularly true of Accord and associated TEs in Drosophila melanogaster and Doc insertions in Drosophila simulans.

Lack of phenotypic and evolutionary cross-resistance against parasitoids and pathogens in Drosophila melanogaster,23285247,10.1371/journal.pone.0053002,"Background:
      
    

    
      When organisms are attacked by multiple natural enemies, the evolution of a resistance mechanism to one natural enemy will be influenced by the degree of cross-resistance to another natural enemy. Cross-resistance can be positive, when a resistance mechanism against one natural enemy also offers resistance to another; or negative, in the form of a trade-off, when an increase in resistance against one natural enemy results in a decrease in resistance against another. Using Drosophila melanogaster, an important model system for the evolution of invertebrate immunity, we test for the existence of cross-resistance against parasites and pathogens, at both a phenotypic and evolutionary level.

      We used a field strain of D. melanogaster to test whether surviving parasitism by the parasitoid Asobara tabida has an effect on the resistance against Beauveria bassiana, an entomopathogenic fungus; and whether infection with the microsporidian Tubulinosema kingi has an effect on the resistance against A. tabida. We used lines selected for increased resistance to A. tabida to test whether increased parasitoid resistance has an effect on resistance against B. bassiana and T. kingi.

      Flies are given a choice between pipets that contain liquid food and liquid food supplemented with EtOH. In some experiments, carbohydrates are added to the non-EtOH-containing food to balance the calories for EtOH.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We confirm that D. melanogaster indeed prefer food that is supplemented with EtOH. However, if the alternative food choice is isocaloric, D. melanogaster usually do not show any preference for a 10% EtOH solution. Even after EtOH preference has been established, it can be completely reversed if the alternative food is calorically supplemented. This occurs even when the carbohydrate solution used to balance calories is not gustatorily attractive. Furthermore, if the alternative food contains more calories than the EtOH food, the flies will prefer the non-EtOH food. We go on to show that during the preference assay that EtOH in the fly does not exceed 4 mM, which in mammals is a nonintoxicating dose.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We conclude that preference for EtOH in this assay arises not from the pharmacological effects of EtOH but rather because of its nutritive value.",2012,"Jascha B Pohl, Brett A Baldwin, Boingoc L Dinh, Pinkey Rahman, Dustin Smerek, Francisco J Prado 3rd, Nyssa Sherazee, Nigel S Atkinson"
Mgat1-dependent N-glycosylation of membrane components primes Drosophila melanogaster blood cells for the cellular encapsulation response,22829770,10.1371/journal.ppat.1002819,"In nature, larvae of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster are commonly infected by parasitoid wasps, and so have evolved a robust immune response to counter wasp infection. In this response, fly immune cells form a multilayered capsule surrounding the wasp egg, leading to death of the parasite. Many of the molecular mechanisms underlying this encapsulation response are conserved with human immune responses. Our findings suggest that protein N-glycosylation, a common protein post-translational modification of human immune proteins, may be one such conserved mechanism. We found that membrane proteins on Drosophila immune cells are N-glycosylated in a temporally specific manner following wasp infection. Furthermore we have identified mutations in eight genes encoding enzymes of the N-glycosylation pathway that decrease fly resistance to wasp infection. More specifically, loss of protein N-glycosylation in immune cells following wasp infection led to the formation of defective capsules, which disintegrated over time and were thereby unsuccessful at preventing wasp development. Interestingly, we also found that one species of Drosophila parasitoid wasp, Leptopilina victoriae, targets protein N-glycosylation as part of its virulence mechanism, and that overexpression of an N-glycosylation enzyme could confer resistance against this wasp species to otherwise susceptible flies. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that protein N-glycosylation is a key player in Drosophila cellular encapsulation and suggest that this response may provide a novel model to study conserved roles of protein glycosylation in immunity.",2012,"Nathan T Mortimer, Balint Z Kacsoh, Erin S Keebaugh, Todd A Schlenke, Nathan T Mortimer, Balint Z Kacsoh, Erin S Keebaugh, Todd A Schlenke"
Developmental expression of drop-dead is required for early adult survival and normal body mass in Drosophila melanogaster,22728457,10.1016/j.ibmb.2012.06.002,"In Drosophila melanogaster, mutations in the gene drop-dead (drd) result in early adult lethality, with flies dying within 2 weeks of eclosion. Additional phenotypes include neurodegeneration, tracheal defects, starvation, reduced body mass, and female sterility. The cause of early lethality and the function of the drd protein remain unknown. In the current study, the temporal profiles of drd expression required for adult survival and body mass regulation were investigated. Knockdown of drd expression by UAS-RNAi transgenes and rescue of drd expression on a drd mutant background by a UAS-drd transgene were controlled with the Heat Shock Protein 70 (Hsp70)-Gal4 driver. Flies were heat-shocked at different stages of their lifecycle, and the survival and body mass of the resulting adult flies were assayed. Surprisingly, the adult lethal phenotype did not depend upon drd expression in the adult. Rather, expression of drd during the second half of metamorphosis was both necessary and sufficient to prevent rapid adult mortality. In contrast, the attainment of normal adult body mass required a different temporal pattern of drd expression. In this case, manipulation of drd expression solely during larval development or metamorphosis had no effect on body mass, while knockdown or rescue of drd expression during all of pre-adult (embryonic, larval, and pupal) development did significantly alter body mass. Together, these results indicate that the adult-lethal gene drd is required only during development. Furthermore, the mutant phenotypes of body mass and lifespan are separable phenotypes arising from an absence of drd expression at different developmental stages.",2012,"Christine Lynn Sansone, Edward M Blumenthal, Christine Lynn Sansone, Edward M Blumenthal"
Tao controls epithelial morphogenesis by promoting Fasciclin 2 endocytosis,23266957,10.1083/jcb.201207150,"Regulation of epithelial cell shape, for example, changes in relative sizes of apical, basal, and lateral membranes, is a key mechanism driving morphogenesis. However, it is unclear how epithelial cells control the size of their membranes. In the epithelium of the Drosophila melanogaster ovary, cuboidal precursor cells transform into a squamous epithelium through a process that involves lateral membrane shortening coupled to apical membrane extension. In this paper, we report a mutation in the gene Tao, which resulted in the loss of this cuboidal to squamous transition. We show that the inability of Tao mutant cells to shorten their membranes was caused by the accumulation of the cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin 2, the Drosophila N-CAM (neural cell adhesion molecule) homologue. Fasciclin 2 accumulation at the lateral membrane of Tao mutant cells prevented membrane shrinking and thereby inhibited morphogenesis. In wild-type cells, Tao initiated morphogenesis by promoting Fasciclin 2 endocytosis at the lateral membrane. Thus, we identify here a mechanism controlling the morphogenesis of a squamous epithelium.",2012,"Juan Manuel Gomez, Ying Wang, Veit Riechmann, Juan Manuel Gomez, Ying Wang, Veit Riechmann"
Segregation of eye and antenna fates maintained by mutual antagonism in Drosophila,22912416,10.1242/dev.078857,"A general question in development is how do adjacent primordia adopt different developmental fates and stably maintain their distinct fates? In Drosophila melanogaster, the adult eye and antenna originate from the embryonic eye-antenna primordium. These cells proliferate in the larval stage to form the eye-antenna disc. The eye or antenna differs at mid second instar with the restricted expression of Cut (Ct), a homeodomain transcriptional repressor, in the antenna disc and Eyeless (Ey), a Pax6 transcriptional activator, in the eye disc. In this study, we show that ey transcription in the antenna disc is repressed by two homeodomain proteins, Ct and Homothorax (Hth). Loss of Ct and Hth in the antenna disc resulted in ectopic eye development in the antenna. Conversely, the Ct and Hth expression in the eye disc was suppressed by the homeodomain transcription factor Sine oculis (So), a direct target of Ey. Loss of So in the eye disc caused ectopic antenna development in the eye. Therefore, the segregation of eye and antenna fates is stably maintained by mutual repression of the other pathway.",2012,"Cheng-Wei Wang, Y Henry Sun, Cheng-Wei Wang, Y Henry Sun"
Sequence signatures involved in targeting the Male-Specific Lethal complex to X-chromosomal genes in Drosophila melanogaster,22424303,10.1186/1471-2164-13-97,"Background:
      
    

    
      In Drosophila melanogaster, the dosage-compensation system that equalizes X-linked gene expression between males and females, thereby assuring that an appropriate balance is maintained between the expression of genes on the X chromosome(s) and the autosomes, is at least partially mediated by the Male-Specific Lethal (MSL) complex. This complex binds to genes with a preference for exons on the male X chromosome with a 3' bias, and it targets most expressed genes on the X chromosome. However, a number of genes are expressed but not targeted by the complex. High affinity sites seem to be responsible for initial recruitment of the complex to the X chromosome, but the targeting to and within individual genes is poorly understood.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We have extensively examined X chromosome sequence variation within five types of gene features (promoters, 5' UTRs, coding sequences, introns, 3' UTRs) and intergenic sequences, and assessed its potential involvement in dosage compensation. Presented results show that: the X chromosome has a distinct sequence composition within its gene features; some of the detected variation correlates with genes targeted by the MSL-complex; the insulator protein BEAF-32 preferentially binds upstream of MSL-bound genes; BEAF-32 and MOF co-localizes in promoters; and that bound genes have a distinct sequence composition that shows a 3' bias within coding sequence.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Although, many strongly bound genes are close to a high affinity site neither our promoter motif nor our coding sequence signatures show any correlation to HAS. Based on the results presented here, we believe that there are sequences in the promoters and coding sequences of targeted genes that have the potential to direct the secondary spreading of the MSL-complex to nearby genes.",2012,"Philge Philip, Fredrik Pettersson, Per Stenberg, Philge Philip, Fredrik Pettersson, Per Stenberg"
Long-lived genotypes for studies of life extension in Drosophila melanogaster,22525703,10.1016/j.mad.2012.04.002,"Numerous single-gene mutations obtained by insertion of P elements in white (w) genetic backgrounds have been reported to extend the life span of Drosophila melanogaster, but life extension is sometimes observed only in relatively short-lived backgrounds. The objective of this study was to develop long- and short-lived, high and low fertility backgrounds in which to test the reproducibility and possible additivity of effects of prospective life-extending treatments. Flies previously reported to be long- or short-lived, following artificial selection for early or delayed reproduction and inbreeding, were rendered essentially isogenic, and a w visible marker was introduced. Isogeny adversely affected both life span and fertility, but w had little or no effect on either trait. Unexpectedly, none of these lines or a stock under uninterrupted selection for delayed reproduction lived any longer than an unselected, highly fertile y w strain used in earlier studies of longevity. Strains derived from one artificial selection experiment were found to contain functional P elements, as did the two longest-lived genotypes in this study, which were inbred without artificial selection. The y w background appears to be at least equally as long-lived as any other currently available for tests of life extension by P{w(+)} mutations.",2012,"Robin J Mockett, Jordan Ciza Cockrell, Shruti Puri, Mye Nguyen, Mehran Nisa, Robin J Mockett, Jordan Ciza Cockrell, Shruti Puri, Mye Nguyen, Mehran Nisa"
"Allelic imbalance in Drosophila hybrid heads: exons, isoforms, and evolution",22319150,10.1093/molbev/msr318,"Unraveling how regulatory divergence contributes to species differences and adaptation requires identifying functional variants from among millions of genetic differences. Analysis of allelic imbalance (AI) reveals functional genetic differences in cis regulation and has demonstrated differences in cis regulation within and between species. Regulatory mechanisms are often highly conserved, yet differences between species in gene expression are extensive. What evolutionary forces explain widespread divergence in cis regulation? AI was assessed in Drosophila melanogaster-Drosophila simulans hybrid female heads using RNA-seq technology. Mapping bias was virtually eliminated by using genotype-specific references. Allele representation in DNA sequencing was used as a prior in a novel Bayesian model for the estimation of AI in RNA. Cis regulatory divergence was common in the organs and tissues of the head with 41% of genes analyzed showing significant AI. Using existing population genomic data, the relationship between AI and patterns of sequence evolution was examined. Evidence of positive selection was found in 30% of cis regulatory divergent genes. Genes involved in defense, RNAi/RISC complex genes, and those that are sex regulated are enriched among adaptively evolving cis regulatory divergent genes. For genes in these groups, adaptive evolution may play a role in regulatory divergence between species. However, there is no evidence that adaptive evolution drives most of the cis regulatory divergence that is observed. The majority of genes showed patterns consistent with stabilizing selection and neutral evolutionary processes.",2012,"R M Graze, L L Novelo, V Amin, J M Fear, G Casella, S V Nuzhdin, L M McIntyre, R M Graze, L L Novelo, V Amin, J M Fear, G Casella, S V Nuzhdin, L M McIntyre"

Often, their use is combined in a synergistic fashion to alter and engineer the fruit fly genome. Transposons are the foundation for all transgenic technologies in flies and hence almost all innovations in the fruit fly. They have been instrumental in the generation of genome-wide collections of insertions for gene disruption and manipulation. Many important transgenic strains of these collections are available from public repositories. The Flp protein is the most widely used recombinase to induce mitotic clones to study individual gene function. However, Flp has also been used to generate chromosome- and genome-wide collections of precise deletions, inversions, and duplications. Similarly, transposons that contain attP attachment sites for the Î¦C31 integrase can be used for numerous applications. This integrase was incorporated into a transgenesis system that allows the integration of small to very large DNA fragments that can be easily manipulated through recombineering. This system allowed the creation of genomic DNA libraries for genome-wide gene manipulations and X chromosome duplications. Moreover, the attP sites are being used to create libraries of tens of thousands of RNAi constructs and tissue-specific GAL4 lines. This chapter focuses on genome-wide applications of transposons, Flp recombinase, and Î¦C31 integrase that greatly facilitate experimental manipulation of Drosophila.",2012,"Koen J T Venken, Hugo J Bellen, Koen J T Venken, Hugo J Bellen"
DNApol-Ïµ gene is indispensable for the survival and growth of Drosophila melanogaster,21898761,10.1002/dvg.20791,"Based on deletion and complementation mapping and DNA sequencing, a new recessive fully penetrant mutation (DNApol-Ïµpl10R), causing prolonged larval life and larval/early pupal lethality, is identified as the first mutant allele of the DNApol-Ïµ (CG6768) gene of Drosophila melanogaster. A same-sense base pair substitution in exon 1 of the DNApol-Ïµ gene is associated with retention of the first intron and significant reduction in DNApol-Ïµ transcripts in DNApol-Ïµpl10R homozygotes. Homozygous mutant larvae show small imaginal discs with fewer cells and reduced polyteny in salivary glands, presumably because of the compromised DNA polymerase function following exhaustion of the maternal contribution. Extremely small and rare DNApol-Ïµpl10R homozygous somatic clones in DNApol-Ïµpl10R/+imaginal discs confirm their poor mitotic activity.

The RhoGEF Zizimin-related acts in the Drosophila cellular immune response via the Rho GTPases Rac2 and Cdc42,22634526,10.1016/j.dci.2012.05.004,"Zizimin-related (Zir), a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) homologous to the mammalian Dock-C/Zizimin-related family, was identified in a screen to find new genes involved in the Drosophila melanogaster cellular immune response against eggs from the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi. RhoGEFs activate Rho-family GTPases, which are known to be central regulators of cell migration, spreading and polarity. When a parasitoid wasp is recognized as foreign, multiple layers of circulating immunosurveillance cells (haemocytes) should attach to the egg. In Zir mutants this process is disrupted and lamellocytes, a haemocyte subtype, fail to properly encapsulate the wasp egg. Furthermore, macrophage-like plasmatocytes exhibit a strong reduction in their ability to phagocytise Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. During encapsulation and phagocytosis Zir genetically interacts with two Rho-family GTPases, Rac2 and Cdc42. Finally, Zir is dispensable for the humoral immune response against bacteria.

Our results do not support the hypothesis that stress increases the efficacy of selection arising from either fitness component.

We found that when given a choice between clean oviposition sites and sites infested with wasps, both D. melanogaster and D. simulans detected and avoided infested sites, which presumably limits later exposure of their offspring to infection. Unlike D. simulans, however, D. melanogaster laid significantly fewer eggs than controls in the forced presence of wasps.

Sperm competitive ability evolves in response to experimental alteration of operational sex ratio,23815666,10.1111/evo.12076,"In naturally polygamous organisms such as Drosophila, sperm competitive ability is one of the most important components of male fitness and is expected to evolve in response to varying degrees of male-male competition.

Even direct selection for increased sperm competitive ability has failed to yield any measurable changes. Here we report the evolution of sperm competitive ability (sperm defense-P1, offense-P2) in a set of replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster subjected to altered levels of male-male competition (generated by varying the operational sex ratio) for 55-60 generations. Males from populations with female-biased operational sex ratio evolved reduced P1 and P2, without any measurable change in the male reproductive behavior. Males in the male-biased regime evolved increased P1, but there was no significant change in P2.

Myc-driven overgrowth requires unfolded protein response-mediated induction of autophagy and antioxidant responses in Drosophila melanogaster,23950728,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003664,"Autophagy, a lysosomal self-degradation and recycling pathway, plays dual roles in tumorigenesis. Autophagy deficiency predisposes to cancer, at least in part, through accumulation of the selective autophagy cargo p62, leading to activation of antioxidant responses and tumor formation. While cell growth and autophagy are inversely regulated in most cells, elevated levels of autophagy are observed in many established tumors, presumably mediating survival of cancer cells. Still, the relationship of autophagy and oncogenic signaling is poorly characterized. Here we show that the evolutionarily conserved transcription factor Myc (dm), a proto-oncogene involved in cell growth and proliferation, is also a physiological regulator of autophagy in Drosophila melanogaster. Loss of Myc activity in null mutants or in somatic clones of cells inhibits autophagy. Forced expression of Myc results in cell-autonomous increases in cell growth, autophagy induction, and p62 (Ref2P)-mediated activation of Nrf2 (cnc), a transcription factor promoting antioxidant responses. Mechanistically, Myc overexpression increases unfolded protein response (UPR), which leads to PERK-dependent autophagy induction and may be responsible for p62 accumulation. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of UPR, autophagy or p62/Nrf2 signaling prevents Myc-induced overgrowth, while these pathways are dispensable for proper growth of control cells. In addition, we show that the autophagy and antioxidant pathways are required in parallel for excess cell growth driven by Myc. Deregulated expression of Myc drives tumor progression in most human cancers, and UPR and autophagy have been implicated in the survival of Myc-dependent cancer cells. Our data obtained in a complete animal show that UPR, autophagy and p62/Nrf2 signaling are required for Myc-dependent cell growth.

Lack of robustness of life extension associated with several single-gene P element mutations in Drosophila melanogaster,23729660,10.1093/gerona/glt031,The hypothesis tested in this study was that single-gene mutations found previously to extend the life span of Drosophila melanogaster could do so consistently in both long-lived y w and standard w (1118) genetic backgrounds.

These results cast doubt on the robustness of life extension in flies carrying single-gene mutations and suggest that the effects of all such mutations should be tested independently in multiple genetic backgrounds and laboratory environments.,2013,"Robin J Mockett, Amber C Nobles, Robin J Mockett, Amber C Nobles"
Reproductive status alters transcriptomic response to infection in female Drosophila melanogaster,23550122,10.1534/g3.112.005306,"Mating and consequent reproduction significantly reduce the ability of female Drosophila melanogaster to defend against systemic bacterial infection. The goal of the present study was to identify genes likely to inform the mechanism of this post-mating immunosuppression. We used microarrays to contrast genome-wide transcript levels in virgin vs. mated females before and after infection. Because the immunosuppressive effect of mating is contingent on the presence of a germline in females, we repeated the entire experiment by using female mutants that do not form a germline. We found that multiple genes involved in egg production show reduced expression in response to infection, and that this reduction is stronger in virgins than it is in mated females. In germline-less females, expression of egg-production genes was predictably low and not differentially affected by infection. We also identified several immune responsive genes that are differentially induced after infection in virgins vs. mated females. Immune genes affected by mating status and egg production genes altered by infection are candidates to inform the mechanism of the trade-off between mating and immune defense.",2013,"Sarah M Short, Brian P Lazzaro, Sarah M Short, Brian P Lazzaro"
Females and males contribute in opposite ways to the evolution of gene order in Drosophila,23696898,10.1371/journal.pone.0064491,"An intriguing association between the spatial layout of chromosomes within nuclei and the evolution of chromosome gene order was recently uncovered. Chromosome regions with conserved gene order in the Drosophila genus are larger if they interact with the inner side of the nuclear envelope in D. melanogaster somatic cells. This observation opens a new door to understand the evolution of chromosomes in the light of the dynamics of the spatial layout of chromosomes and the way double-strand breaks are repaired in D. melanogaster germ lines. Chromosome regions at the nuclear periphery in somatic cell nuclei relocate to more internal locations of male germ line cell nuclei, which might prefer a gene order-preserving mechanism to repair double-strand breaks. Conversely, chromosome regions at the nuclear periphery in somatic cells keep their location in female germ line cell nuclei, which might be inaccessible for cellular machinery that causes gene order-disrupting chromosome rearrangements. Thus, the gene order stability for genome regions at the periphery of somatic cell nuclei might result from the active repair of double-strand breaks using conservative mechanisms in male germ line cells, and the passive inaccessibility for gene order-disrupting factors at the periphery of nuclei of female germ line cells. In the present article, I find evidence consistent with a DNA break repair-based differential contribution of both D. melanogaster germ lines to the stability/disruption of gene order. The importance of germ line differences for the layout of chromosomes and DNA break repair strategies with regard to other genomic patterns is briefly discussed.",2013,"Carlos DÃ­az-Castillo, Carlos DÃ­az-Castillo"
A functional role of the extracellular domain of Crumbs in cell architecture and apicobasal polarity,23525000,10.1242/jcs.122382,"Regulated cell shape changes in epithelial cells, which contribute to most organs and tissues, are at the basis of morphogenesis. Crumbs (Crb) is an essential apical determinant controlling epithelial apicobasal polarity. Here we provide evidence for a novel role of Crb apical localisation and stabilisation in controlling cell shape through apical domain organisation and adherens junction positioning. We find that Crb apical stabilisation requires the extracellular domain. In vivo results from Drosophila suggest that the extracellular domain assists Crb apical stabilisation by mediating Crb-Crb interactions at opposing cell membranes. We further confirm Crb-Crb extracellular interactions by showing that the extracellular domain of Crb is sufficient to promote cell aggregation in vitro. Furthermore, we report that Crb apical stabilisation mediated by the extracellular domain is also required for maintenance of Crb apicobasal polarity. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of apicobasal polarity and the cellular mechanisms of tissue architecture.",2013,"Annalisa Letizia, Sara Ricardo, Bernard Moussian, NicolÃ¡s MartÃ­n, Marta Llimargas, Annalisa Letizia, Sara Ricardo, Bernard Moussian, NicolÃ¡s MartÃ­n, Marta Llimargas"
Girard derivatization for LC-MS/MS profiling of endogenous ecdysteroids in Drosophila,23843360,10.1194/jlr.D035949,"Ecdysteroids are potent developmental regulators that control molting, reproduction, and stress response in arthropods. In developing larvae, picogram quantities of individual ecdysteroids and their conjugated forms are present along with milligrams of structural and energy storage lipids. To enhance the specificity and sensitivity of ecdysteroid detection, we targeted the 6-ketone group, which is common to all ecdysteroids, with Girard reagents. Unlike other ketosteroids, during the reaction, Girard hydrazones of ecdysteroids eliminated the C14-hydroxyl group, creating an additional C14-C15 double bond. Dehydrated hydrazones of endogenous ecdysteroids were detected by LC-MS/MS in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode using two mass transitions: one relied upon neutral loss of a quaternary amine from the Girard T moiety; another complementary transition followed neutral loss of the hydrocarbon chain upon C20-C27 cleavage.

Although the precise molecular composition and ultra-structure of the nuclear matrix is not known, proteins and RNA molecules are its major components and several nuclear matrix proteins have been identified. However, the nature of its RNA component is unknown. Here we show that in Drosophila melanogaster, transcripts from AAGAG repeats of several hundred nucleotide in length are critical constituents of the nuclear matrix. While both the strands of this repeat are transcribed and are nuclear matrix associated, the polypurine strand is predominantly detected in situ.

Combinatorial effects of transposable elements on gene expression and phenotypic robustness in Drosophila melanogaster development,23833214,10.1534/g3.113.006791,"Embryonic patterning displays remarkable consistency from individual to individual despite frequent environmental perturbations and diverse genetic contexts. Stochastic influences on the cellular environment may cause transcription rates to fluctuate, but these fluctuations rarely lead to developmental defects or disease. Here we characterize a set of recessive alleles of the Toll pathway component tube that destabilize embryonic dorsoventral patterning in Drosophila melanogaster. Females bearing these tube alleles generate embryos of an unusually wide range of dorsalized phenotypes, with the distributions across this range being unique for each allele. We determine that the mutant lines have in common a retrotransposon insertion upstream of the tube transcription start site. Genetic and molecular approaches demonstrate that this insertion dramatically reduces maternal expression of tube, thereby uncovering the inherent variability in gene expression. We further find that additional transposable element insertions near the tube gene synergistically enhance the phenotype caused by the sensitizing upstream insertion. These studies document how phenotypic variability can arise from normally occurring fluctuations around reduced mean expression and illustrate the contribution of transposons, individually and combinatorially, to such a state.",2013,"Alexa W Clemmons, Steven A Wasserman, Alexa W Clemmons, Steven A Wasserman"
miR-34 is maternally inherited in Drosophila melanogaster and Danio rerio,23470996,10.1093/nar/gkt139,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, endogenous, regulatory RNA molecules that can bind to partially complementary regions on target messenger RNAs and impede their expression or translation. We rationalized that miRNAs, being localized to the cytoplasm, will be maternally inherited during fertilization and may play a role in early development. Although Dicer is known to be essential for the transition from single-celled zygote to two-cell embryo, a direct role for miRNAs has not yet been demonstrated. We identified miRNAs with targets in zygotically expressed transcripts in Drosophila using a combination of transcriptome analysis and miRNA target prediction. We experimentally established that Drosophila miRNA dme-miR-34, the fly homologue of the cancer-related mammalian miRNA miR-34, involved in somatic-cell reprogramming and having critical role in early neuronal differentiation, is present in Drosophila embryos before initiation of zygotic transcription. We also show that the Drosophila miR-34 is dependent on maternal Dicer-1 for its expression in oocytes. Further, we show that miR-34 is also abundant in unfertilized oocytes of zebrafish. Its temporal expression profile during early development showed abundant expression in unfertilized oocytes that gradually decreased by 5 days post-fertilization (dpf). We find that knocking down the maternal, but not the zygotic, miR-34 led to developmental defects in the neuronal system during early embryonic development in zebrafish.

Of the approximately 5,500 B. cenocepacia H111 random mini-Tn5 insertion mutants that were screened, 22 showed attenuated virulence in C. elegans. Except for the quorum-sensing regulator cepR, none of the mutated genes coded for the biosynthesis of classical virulence factors such as extracellular proteases or siderophores. Instead, the mutants contained insertions in metabolic and regulatory genes. Mutants attenuated in virulence in the C. elegans infection model were also tested in the Drosophila melanogaster pricking model, and those also attenuated in this model were further tested in Galleria mellonella.

5-HT stimulation of heart rate in Drosophila does not act through cAMP as revealed by pharmacogenetics,24092690,10.1152/japplphysiol.00849.2013,"The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a good experimental organism to study the underlying mechanism of heart rate (HR) regulation. It is already known that many neuromodulators (serotonin, dopamine, octopamine, acetylcholine) change the HR in Drosophila melanogaster larvae. In this study, we investigated the role of cAMP-PKA signaling pathway in HR regulation and 5-HT positive chronotropic action. In order to obtain insight into the 5-HT mechanism of action in larvae cardiomyocytes, genetic and pharmacological approaches were used. We used transgenic flies that expressed the hM4Di receptor [designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs)] as one tool. Our previous results showed that activation of hM4Di receptors (modified muscarinic acetylcholine receptors) decreases or arrests the heart from beating. In this study, it was hypothesized that the positive chronotropic effect of serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] are mediated by serotonin receptors coupled to the adenylyl cyclase pathway and downstream cAMP and PKA activity. Activation of hM4Di by clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) was predicted to block the effects of serotonin by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activity through GÎ±i pathway activation. Interestingly, we found here that manipulation of adenylyl cyclase activity and cAMP levels had no significant effect on HR. The ability of hM4Di receptor activation to slow or stop the heart is therefore likely mediated by activation of GIRK channels to produce hyperpolarization of cardiomyocytes, and not through inhibition of adenylyl cyclase.",2013,"Zana R Majeed, Charles D Nichols, Robin L Cooper, Zana R Majeed, Charles D Nichols, Robin L Cooper"

Effects of overexpression of mitochondrial transcription factor A on lifespan and oxidative stress response in Drosophila melanogaster,23206694,10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.084,"Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) plays a role in the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by packaging mtDNA, forming the mitochondrial nucleoid. There have been many reports about a function of TFAM at the cellular level, but only a few studies have been done in individual organisms. Here we examined the effects of TFAM on the Drosophila lifespan and oxidative stress response, by overexpressing TFAM using the GAL4/UAS system. Under standard conditions, the lifespan of TFAM-overexpressing flies was shorter than that of the control flies. However, the lifespan of TFAM-overexpressing flies was longer when they were treated with 1% H(2)O(2). These results suggest that even though excess TFAM has a negative influence on lifespan, it has a defensive function under strong oxidative stress. In the TFAM-overexpressing flies, no significant changes in mtDNA copy number or mtDNA transcription were observed. However, the results of a total antioxidant activity assay suggest the possibility that TFAM is involved in the elimination of oxidative stress.

In this case, the insulator protein CP190 is found on the hsp70 promoter, which depends on the presence of an insulator in the transgene.

Memory decay and susceptibility to amnesia dissociate punishment--from relief-learning,23658002,10.1098/rsbl.2012.1171,"Painful events shape future behaviour in two ways: stimuli associated with pain onset subsequently support learned avoidance (i.e. punishment-learning) because they signal future, upcoming pain. Stimuli associated with pain offset in turn signal relief and later on support learned approach (i.e. relief-learning). The relative strengths of such punishment- and relief-learning can be crucial for the adaptive organization of behaviour in the aftermath of painful events. Using Drosophila, we compare punishment- and relief-memories in terms of their temporal decay and sensitivity to retrograde amnesia. During the first 75 min following training, relief-memory is stable, whereas punishment-memory decays to half of the initial score. By 24 h after training, however, relief-memory is lost, whereas a third of punishment-memory scores still remain. In accordance with such rapid temporal decay from 75 min on, retrograde amnesia erases relief-memory but leaves a half of punishment-memory scores intact. These findings suggest differential mechanistic bases for punishment- and relief-memory, thus offering possibilities for separately interfering with either of them.",2013,"SÃ¶ren Diegelmann, Stephan Preuschoff, Mirjam Appel, Thomas Niewalda, Bertram Gerber, Ayse Yarali, SÃ¶ren Diegelmann, Stephan Preuschoff, Mirjam Appel, Thomas Niewalda, Bertram Gerber, Ayse Yarali"

We also find that direct injection of Photorhabdus bacteria into flies fails to induce the transcription of antimicrobial peptide genes and stress-related genes in Drosophila.

These morphological transformations correlate with the appearance of complementary distributions of myosin and Bazooka in the primordium. These distributions suggest that a two-dimensional pattern of line tensions along cell-cell edges on the apical side of the epithelium is sufficient to produce the observed changes in morphology.

Nicotine increases lifespan and rescues olfactory and motor deficits in a Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease,23871228,10.1016/j.bbr.2013.07.020,"Drosophila melanogaster is an attractive model of familial Parkinson's disease, as flies with loss-of-function mutations of the parkin gene exhibit many pathologies observed in PD patients. Progressive motor deficits found in homozygous parkin mutants seem to result from mitochondrial pathology that causes indirect flight muscle and dopaminergic neuronal degeneration [1,2]. We have found that heterozygous parkin mutants have decreased lifespan, generally progressive motor dysfunction and olfactory deficits compared to control flies, suggesting that mutation of this gene produces a dominant phenotype. Tobacco smokers are dose-dependently less likely to develop PD [3,4]; subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies show that nicotine is protective in models of sporadic PD [6]. Literature addressing the potential protection by nicotine in Parkin loss-of-function models spans limited concentrations and selected time points in the organism's lifespan. We have found that parkin heterozygotes have late-onset climbing and flying deficits as well as decreased viability and olfactory deficits that precede motor defects. While chronic nicotine exposure decreases lifespan and climbing and flying abilities in control flies, it can improve viability and flying capability as well as rescue climbing and olfactory deficits in parkin heterozygotes. Dopaminergic neurons are spared in the parkin heterozygote, perhaps because this phenotype is less severe than in the homozygous parkin mutants.

Genome-wide association study of sleep in Drosophila melanogaster,23617951,10.1186/1471-2164-14-281,"Background:
      
    

    
      Sleep is a highly conserved behavior, yet its duration and pattern vary extensively among species and between individuals within species. The genetic basis of natural variation in sleep remains unknown.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We used the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) to perform a genome-wide association (GWA) study of sleep in D. melanogaster. We identified candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with differences in the mean as well as the environmental sensitivity of sleep traits; these SNPs typically had sex-specific or sex-biased effects, and were generally located in non-coding regions. The majority of SNPs (80.3%) affecting sleep were at low frequency and had moderately large effects. Additive models incorporating multiple SNPs explained as much as 55% of the genetic variance for sleep in males and females. Many of these loci are known to interact physically and/or genetically, enabling us to place them in candidate genetic networks. We confirmed the role of seven novel loci on sleep using insertional mutagenesis and RNA interference.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We identified many SNPs in novel loci that are potentially associated with natural variation in sleep, as well as SNPs within genes previously known to affect Drosophila sleep. Several of the candidate genes have human homologues that were identified in studies of human sleep, suggesting that genes affecting variation in sleep are conserved across species. Our discovery of genetic variants that influence environmental sensitivity to sleep may have a wider application to all GWA studies, because individuals with highly plastic genotypes will not have consistent phenotypes.",2013,"Susan T Harbison, Lenovia J McCoy, Trudy F C Mackay, Susan T Harbison, Lenovia J McCoy, Trudy F C Mackay"
Functional diversity among sensory receptors in a Drosophila olfactory circuit,23690583,10.1073/pnas.1306976110,"The ability of an animal to detect, discriminate, and respond to odors depends on the function of its olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), which in turn depends ultimately on odorant receptors. To understand the diverse mechanisms used by an animal in olfactory coding and computation, it is essential to understand the functional diversity of its odor receptors. The larval olfactory system of Drosophila melanogaster contains 21 ORNs and a comparable number of odorant receptors whose properties have been examined in only a limited way. We systematically screened them with a panel of ??00 odorants, yielding >10,000 receptor-odorant combinations. We identify for each of 19 receptors an odorant that excites it strongly. The responses elicited by each of these odorants are analyzed in detail. The odorants elicited little cross-activation of other receptors at the test concentration; thus, low concentrations of many of these odorants in nature may be signaled by a single ORN. The receptors differed dramatically in sensitivity to their cognate odorants. The responses showed diverse temporal dynamics, with some odorants eliciting supersustained responses. An intriguing question in the field concerns the roles of different ORNs and receptors in driving behavior. We found that the cognate odorants elicited behavioral responses that varied across a broad range.

Strong purifying selection at synonymous sites in D. melanogaster,23737754,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003527,"Synonymous sites are generally assumed to be subject to weak selective constraint. For this reason, they are often neglected as a possible source of important functional variation. We use site frequency spectra from deep population sequencing data to show that, contrary to this expectation, 22% of four-fold synonymous (4D) sites in Drosophila melanogaster evolve under very strong selective constraint while few, if any, appear to be under weak constraint. Linking polymorphism with divergence data, we further find that the fraction of synonymous sites exposed to strong purifying selection is higher for those positions that show slower evolution on the Drosophila phylogeny. The function underlying the inferred strong constraint appears to be separate from splicing enhancers, nucleosome positioning, and the translational optimization generating canonical codon bias. The fraction of synonymous sites under strong constraint within a gene correlates well with gene expression, particularly in the mid-late embryo, pupae, and adult developmental stages. Genes enriched in strongly constrained synonymous sites tend to be particularly functionally important and are often involved in key developmental pathways. Given that the observed widespread constraint acting on synonymous sites is likely not limited to Drosophila, the role of synonymous sites in genetic disease and adaptation should be reevaluated.",2013,"David S Lawrie, Philipp W Messer, Ruth Hershberg, Dmitri A Petrov, David S Lawrie, Philipp W Messer, Ruth Hershberg, Dmitri A Petrov"

Phospholipase C mediates TRP/TRPL opening, but the gating process remains unknown. Controversial evidence has suggested diacylglycerol (DAG), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs, a DAG metabolite), phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2), and H(+) as possible channel activators. We tested each of them directly in inside-out TRP-expressing patches excised from the rhabdomere, making use of mutants and pharmacology. When patches were excised in darkness TRP remained closed, while when excised under illumination it stayed constitutively active. TRP was opened by DAG and silenced by ATP, suggesting DAG-kinase (DGK) involvement. The ATP effect was abolished by inhibiting DGK and in the rdgA mutant, lacking functional DGK, implicating DGK. DAG activated TRP even in the presence of a DAG-lipase inhibitor, inconsistent with a requirement of PUFAs in opening TRP. PIP2 had no effect and acidification, pH 6.4, activated TRP irreversibly, unlike the endogenous activator. Complementary liquid-chromatography/mass-spectrometry determinations of DAG and PUFAs in membranes enriched in rhabdomere obtained from light- and dark-adapted eyes showed light-dependent increment in six DAG species and no changes in PUFAs. The results strongly support DAG as the endogenous TRP agonist, as some of its vertebrate TRPC homologs of the same channel family.",2014,"Ricardo Delgado, Yorka MuÃ±oz, Hugo PeÃ±a-CortÃ©s, Patrick Giavalisco, Juan Bacigalupo, Ricardo Delgado, Yorka MuÃ±oz, Hugo PeÃ±a-CortÃ©s, Patrick Giavalisco, Juan Bacigalupo"
Drosophila oogenesis as a bio-marker responding to EMF sources,23915130,10.3109/15368378.2013.800102,"The model biological organisms Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis have been utilized to assess effects on apoptotic cell death of follicles during oogenesis and reproductive capacity (fecundity) decline. A total of 280 different experiments were performed using newly emerged flies exposed for short time daily for 3-7 d to various EMF sources including: GSM 900/1800 MHz mobile phone, 1880-1900 MHz DECT wireless base, DECT wireless handset, mobile phone-DECT handset combination, 2.44 GHz wireless network (Wi-Fi), 2.44 GHz blue tooth, 92.8 MHz FM generator, 27.15 MHz baby monitor, 900 MHz CW RF generator and microwave oven's 2.44 GHz RF and magnetic field components. Mobile phone was used as a reference exposure system for evaluating factors considered very important in dosimetry extending our published work with D. melanogaster to the insect D. virilis. Distance from the emitting source, the exposure duration and the repeatability were examined. All EMF sources used created statistically significant effects regarding fecundity and cell death-apoptosis induction, even at very low intensity levels (0.3 V/m blue tooth radiation), well below ICNIRP's guidelines, suggesting that Drosophila oogenesis system is suitable to be used as a biomarker for exploring potential EMF bioactivity. Also, there is no linear cumulative effect when increasing the duration of exposure or using one EMF source after the other (i.e. mobile phone and DECT handset) at the specific conditions used.

Entropy of finite random binary sequences with weak long-range correlations,25493739,10.1103/PhysRevE.90.052106,"We study the N-step binary stationary ergodic Markov chain and analyze its differential entropy. Supposing that the correlations are weak we express the conditional probability function of the chain through the pair correlation function and represent the entropy as a functional of the pair correlator. Since the model uses the two-point correlators instead of the block probability, it makes it possible to calculate the entropy of strings at much longer distances than using standard methods. A fluctuation contribution to the entropy due to finiteness of random chains is examined. This contribution can be of the same order as its regular part even at the relatively short lengths of subsequences. A self-similar structure of entropy with respect to the decimation transformations is revealed for some specific forms of the pair correlation function.

Brahma regulates a specific trans-splicing event at the mod(mdg4) locus of Drosophila melanogaster,24526065,10.4161/rna.27866,"The mod(mdg4) locus of Drosophila melanogaster contains several transcription units encoded on both DNA strands. The mod(mdg4) pre-mRNAs are alternatively spliced, and a very significant fraction of the mature mod(mdg4) mRNAs are formed by trans-splicing. We have studied the transcripts derived from one of the anti-sense regions within the mod(mdg4) locus in order to shed light on the expression of this complex locus. We have characterized the expression of anti-sense mod(mdg4) transcripts in S2 cells, mapped their transcription start sites and cleavage sites, identified and quantified alternatively spliced transcripts, and obtained insight into the regulation of the mod(mdg4) trans-splicing. In a previous study, we had shown that the alternative splicing of some mod(mdg4) transcripts was regulated by Brahma (BRM), the ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. Here we show, using RNA interference and overexpression of recombinant BRM proteins, that the levels of BRM affect specifically the abundance of a trans-spliced mod(mdg4) mRNA isoform in both S2 cells and larvae. This specific effect on trans-splicing is accompanied by a local increase in the density of RNA polymerase II and by a change in the phosphorylation state of the C-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II. Interestingly, the regulation of the mod(mdg4) splicing by BRM is independent of the ATPase activity of BRM, which suggests that the mechanism by which BRM modulates trans-splicing is independent of its chromatin-remodeling activity.",2014,"Simei Yu, Johan Waldholm, Stefanie BÃ¶hm, Neus Visa, Simei Yu, Johan Waldholm, Stefanie BÃ¶hm, Neus Visa"
Orthodenticle is required for the development of olfactory projection neurons and local interneurons in Drosophila,24996925,10.1242/bio.20148524,"The accurate wiring of nervous systems involves precise control over cellular processes like cell division, cell fate specification, and targeting of neurons. The nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model to understand these processes. Drosophila neurons are generated by stem cell like precursors called neuroblasts that are formed and specified in a highly stereotypical manner along the neuroectoderm. This stereotypy has been attributed, in part, to the expression and function of transcription factors that act as intrinsic cell fate determinants in the neuroblasts and their progeny during embryogenesis. Here we focus on the lateral neuroblast lineage, ALl1, of the antennal lobe and show that the transcription factor-encoding cephalic gap gene orthodenticle is required in this lineage during postembryonic brain development. We use immunolabelling to demonstrate that Otd is expressed in the neuroblast of this lineage during postembryonic larval stages. Subsequently, we use MARCM clonal mutational methods to show that the majority of the postembryonic neuronal progeny in the ALl1 lineage undergoes apoptosis in the absence of orthodenticle. Moreover, we demonstrate that the neurons that survive in the orthodenticle loss-of-function condition display severe targeting defects in both the proximal (dendritic) and distal (axonal) neurites. These findings indicate that the cephalic gap gene orthodenticle acts as an important intrinsic determinant in the ALl1 neuroblast lineage and, hence, could be a member of a putative combinatorial code involved in specifying the fate and identity of cells in this lineage.",2014,"Sonia Sen, Silvia Biagini, Heinrich Reichert, K VijayRaghavan, Sonia Sen, Silvia Biagini, Heinrich Reichert, K VijayRaghavan"
"The chromatin landscape of Drosophila: comparisons between species, sexes, and chromosomes",24840603,10.1101/gr.172155.114,"The chromatin landscape is key for gene regulation, but little is known about how it differs between sexes or between species. Here, we study the sex-specific chromatin landscape of Drosophila miranda, a species with young sex chromosomes, and compare it with Drosophila melanogaster. We analyze six histone modifications in male and female larvae of D. miranda (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K36me3, H4K16ac, H3K27me3, and H3K9me2), and define seven biologically meaningful chromatin states that show different enrichments for transcribed and silent genes, repetitive elements, housekeeping, and tissue-specific genes. The genome-wide distribution of both active and repressive chromatin states differs between males and females. In males, active chromatin is enriched on the X, relative to females, due to dosage compensation of the hemizygous X. Furthermore, a smaller fraction of the euchromatic portion of the genome is in a repressive chromatin state in males relative to females. However, sex-specific chromatin states appear not to explain sex-biased expression of genes. Overall, conservation of chromatin states between male and female D. miranda is comparable to conservation between D. miranda and D. melanogaster, which diverged >30 MY ago. Active chromatin states are more highly conserved across species, while heterochromatin shows very low levels of conservation. Divergence in chromatin profiles contributes to expression divergence between species, with ??6% of genes in different chromatin states in the two species showing species-specific or species-biased expression, an enrichment of approximately threefold over null expectation. Our data suggest that heteromorphic sex chromosomes in males (that is, a hypertranscribed X and an inactivated Y) may contribute to global redistribution of active and repressive chromatin marks between chromosomes and sexes.",2014,"Emily J Brown, Doris Bachtrog, Emily J Brown, Doris Bachtrog"
Diverse patterns of genomic targeting by transcriptional regulators in Drosophila melanogaster,24985916,10.1101/gr.168807.113,"Annotation of regulatory elements and identification of the transcription-related factors (TRFs) targeting these elements are key steps in understanding how cells interpret their genetic blueprint and their environment during development, and how that process goes awry in the case of disease. One goal of the modENCODE (model organism ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements) Project is to survey a diverse sampling of TRFs, both DNA-binding and non-DNA-binding factors, to provide a framework for the subsequent study of the mechanisms by which transcriptional regulators target the genome. Here we provide an updated map of the Drosophila melanogaster regulatory genome based on the location of 84 TRFs at various stages of development. This regulatory map reveals a variety of genomic targeting patterns, including factors with strong preferences toward proximal promoter binding, factors that target intergenic and intronic DNA, and factors with distinct chromatin state preferences. The data also highlight the stringency of the Polycomb regulatory network, and show association of the Trithorax-like (Trl) protein with hotspots of DNA binding throughout development. Furthermore, the data identify more than 5800 instances in which TRFs target DNA regions with demonstrated enhancer activity. Regions of high TRF co-occupancy are more likely to be associated with open enhancers used across cell types, while lower TRF occupancy regions are associated with complex enhancers that are also regulated at the epigenetic level.

Behavior of aberrant chromosome configurations in Drosophila melanogaster female meiosis I,25491942,10.1534/g3.114.014316,"One essential role of the first meiotic division is to reduce chromosome number by half. Although this is normally accomplished by segregating homologous chromosomes from each other, it is possible for a genome to have one or more chromosomes that lack a homolog (such as compound chromosomes), or have chromosomes with multiple potential homologs (such as in XXY females). These configurations complete meiosis but engage in unusual segregation patterns. In Drosophila melanogaster females carrying two compound chromosomes, the compounds can accurately segregate from each other, a process known as heterologous segregation. Similarly, in XXY females, when the X chromosomes fail to cross over, they often undergo secondary nondisjunction, where both Xs segregate away from the Y. Although both of these processes have been known for decades, the orientation mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Taking advantage of the recent discovery of chromosome congression in female meiosis I, we have examined a number of different aberrant chromosome configurations. We show that these genotypes complete congression normally, with their chromosomes bioriented at metaphase I arrest at the same rates that they segregate, indicating that orientation must be established during prometaphase I before congression. We also show that monovalent chromosomes can move out on the prometaphase I spindle, but the dot 4 chromosomes appear required for this movement. Finally, we show that, similar to achiasmate chromosomes, heterologous chromosomes can be connected by chromatin threads, suggesting a mechanism for how heterochromatic homology establishes these unusual biorientation patterns.",2014,"William D Gilliland, Eileen M Colwell, Fiona M Lane, Ashley A Snouffer, William D Gilliland, Eileen M Colwell, Fiona M Lane, Ashley A Snouffer"

In the Drosophila melanogaster sensory bristle lineages, Numb inhibits the recycling of Notch and its trafficking partner Sanpodo (Spdo) to regulate cell fate after asymmetric cell division. In this paper, we have used a dual GFP/Cherry tagging approach to study the distribution and endosomal sorting of Notch and Spdo in living pupae. The specific properties of GFP, i.e., quenching at low pH, and Cherry, i.e., slow maturation time, revealed distinct pools of Notch and Spdo: cargoes exhibiting high GFP/low Cherry fluorescence intensities localized mostly at the plasma membrane and early/sorting endosomes, whereas low GFP/high Cherry cargoes accumulated in late acidic endosomes. These properties were used to show that Spdo is sorted toward late endosomes in a Numb-dependent manner.

Analysis of dopaminergic neuronal dysfunction in genetic and toxin-induced models of Parkinson's disease in Drosophila,25040725,10.1111/jnc.12818,"Drosophila melanogaster has contributed significantly to the understanding of disease mechanisms in Parkinson's disease (PD) as it is one of the very few PD model organisms that allow the study of age-dependent behavioral defects, physiology and histology, and genetic interactions among different PD-related genes. However, there have been contradictory results from a number of recent reports regarding the loss of dopaminergic neurons in different PD fly models. In an attempt to re-evaluate and clarify this issue, we have examined three different genetic (Î±-synuclein, Pink1, parkin) and two toxin-based (rotenone and paraquat) models of the disease for neuronal cell loss. Our results showed no dopaminergic neuronal loss in all models tested. Despite this surprising result, we found additional phenotypes showing the dysfunctional status of the dopaminergic neurons in most of the models analyzed. A common feature found in most models is a quantifiable decrease in the fluorescence of a green-fluorescent protein reporter gene in dopaminergic neurons that correlates well with other phenotypes found for these models and can be reliably used as a hallmark of the neurodegenerative process when modeling diseases affecting the dopaminergic system in Drosophila. Analyzing three genetic and two toxin-based Drosophila models of Parkinson's disease (PD) through green fluorescent protein reporter and Î±-tyrosine hydroxylase staining, we have found the number of dopaminergic neurons to remain unchanged. Despite the lack of neuronal loss, we have detected a remarkable decrease in a reporter green-fluorescent protein (GFP) signal in dopaminergic neurons, suggesting an abnormal neuronal status that correlates with the phenotypes associated with those PD fly models.",2014,"Juan A Navarro, Sabina He?ner, Sarat C Yenisetti, Florian Bayersdorfer, Li Zhang, Aaron Voigt, Stephan Schneuwly, Jose A Botella, Juan A Navarro, Sabina He?ner, Sarat C Yenisetti, Florian Bayersdorfer, Li Zhang, Aaron Voigt, Stephan Schneuwly, Jose A Botella"

A Drosophila melanogaster model of diastolic dysfunction and cardiomyopathy based on impaired troponin-T function,24221941,10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.114.302028,"Rationale:
      
    

    
      Regulation of striated muscle contraction is achieved by Ca2+ -dependent steric modulation of myosin cross-bridge cycling on actin by the thin filament troponin-tropomyosin complex. Alterations in the complex can induce contractile dysregulation and disease. For example, mutations between or near residues 112 to 136 of cardiac troponin-T, the crucial TnT1 (N-terminal domain of troponin-T)-tropomyosin-binding region, cause cardiomyopathy. The Drosophila upheld(101) Glu/Lys amino acid substitution lies C-terminally adjacent to this phylogenetically conserved sequence.
    

    
  


        Objective:
      
    

    
      Using a highly integrative approach, we sought to determine the molecular trigger of upheld(101) myofibrillar degeneration, to evaluate contractile performance in the mutant cardiomyocytes, and to examine the effects of the mutation on the entire Drosophila heart to elucidate regulatory roles for conserved TnT1 regions and provide possible mechanistic insight into cardiac dysfunction.
    

    
  


        Methods and results:
      
    

    
      Live video imaging of Drosophila cardiac tubes revealed that the troponin-T mutation prolongs systole and restricts diastolic dimensions of the heart, because of increased numbers of actively cycling myosin cross-bridges. Elevated resting myocardial stiffness, consistent with upheld(101) diastolic dysfunction, was confirmed by an atomic force microscopy-based nanoindentation approach. Direct visualization of mutant thin filaments via electron microscopy and 3-dimensional reconstruction resolved destabilized tropomyosin positioning and aberrantly exposed myosin-binding sites under low Ca2+ conditions.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      As a result of troponin-tropomyosin dysinhibition, upheld(101) hearts exhibited cardiac dysfunction and remodeling comparable to that observed during human restrictive cardiomyopathy. Thus, reversal of charged residues about the conserved tropomyosin-binding region of TnT1 may perturb critical intermolecular associations required for proper steric regulation, which likely elicits myopathy in our Drosophila model.",2014,"Meera Cozhimuttam Viswanathan, Gaurav Kaushik, Adam J Engler, William Lehman, Anthony Cammarato, Meera Cozhimuttam Viswanathan, Gaurav Kaushik, Adam J Engler, William Lehman, Anthony Cammarato"
Regulation of food intake by mechanosensory ion channels in enteric neurons,25285450,10.7554/eLife.04402,"Regulation of food intake is fundamental to energy homeostasis in animals. The contribution of non-nutritive and metabolic signals in regulating feeding is unclear. Here we show that enteric neurons play a major role in regulating feeding through specialized mechanosensory ion channels in Drosophila. Modulating activities of a specific subset of enteric neurons, the posterior enteric neurons (PENs), results in sixfold changes in food intake. Deficiency of the mechanosensory ion channel PPK1 gene or RNAi knockdown of its expression in the PENS result in a similar increase in food intake, which can be rescued by expression of wild-type PPK1 in the same neurons. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of the mechanosensory ion channel phenocopies the result of genetic interrogation. Together, our study provides the first molecular genetic evidence that mechanosensory ion channels in the enteric neurons are involved in regulating feeding, offering an enticing alternative to current therapeutic strategy for weight control.",2014,"William H Olds, Tian Xu, William H Olds, Tian Xu"
Adaptation of the length scale and amplitude of the Bicoid gradient profile to achieve robust patterning in abnormally large Drosophila melanogaster embryos,24284208,10.1242/dev.098640,"The formation of patterns that are proportional to the size of the embryo is an intriguing but poorly understood feature of development. Molecular mechanisms controlling such proportionality, or scaling, can be probed through quantitative interrogations of the properties of morphogen gradients that instruct patterning. Recent studies of the Drosophila morphogen gradient Bicoid (Bcd), which is required for anterior-posterior (AP) patterning in the early embryo, have uncovered two distinct ways of scaling. Whereas between-species scaling is achieved by adjusting the exponential shape characteristic of the Bcd gradient profile, namely, its length scale or length constant (Î»), within-species scaling is achieved through adjusting the profile's amplitude, namely, the Bcd concentration at the anterior (B0). Here, we report a case in which Drosophila melanogaster embryos exhibit Bcd gradient properties uncharacteristic of their size. The embryos under investigation were from a pair of inbred lines that had been artificially selected for egg size extremes. We show that B0 in the large embryos is uncharacteristically low but Î» is abnormally extended. Although the large embryos have more total bcd mRNA than their smaller counterparts, as expected, its distribution is unusually broad. We show that the large and small embryos develop gene expression patterns exhibiting boundaries that are proportional to their respective lengths. Our results suggest that the large-egg inbred line has acquired compensating properties that counteract the extreme length of the embryos to maintain Bcd gradient properties necessary for robust patterning. Our study documents, for the first time to our knowledge, a case of within-species Bcd scaling achieved through adjusting the gradient profile's exponential shape characteristic, illustrating at a molecular level how a developmental system can follow distinct operational paths towards the goal of robust and scaled patterning.",2014,"David Cheung, Cecelia Miles, Martin Kreitman, Jun Ma, David Cheung, Cecelia Miles, Martin Kreitman, Jun Ma"

      The D. melanogaster-M. abscessus model enabled an assessment of the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment. Tigecycline was the best drug for extending the lifespan of M. abscessus-infected Drosophila, followed by clarithromycin and linezolid. Several different combinations of tigecycline, linezolid and clarithromycin were tested to determine the best combination. Tigecycline (25 mg/L) plus linezolid (500 mg/L) was the best drug combination and its efficacy was superior to conventional regimens, not only in prolonging infected fly survival but also against M. abscessus colonization and dissemination.

Multi-unit recording with iridium oxide modified stereotrodes in Drosophila melanogaster,24286699,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2013.11.013,"Background:
      
    

    
      Drosophila is a very favorable animal model for the studies of neuroscience. However, it remains a great challenge to employ electrophysiological approaches in Drosophila to study the neuronal assembly dynamics in vivo, partially due to the small size of the Drosophila brain. Small and sensitive microelectrodes for multi-unit recordings are greatly desired.
    

    
  


        New method:
      
    

    
      We fabricated micro-scale stereotrodes for electrical recordings in Drosophila melanogaster. The stereotrodes were modified with iridium oxide (IrO2) under a highly controllable deposition procedure to improve their electrochemical properties. Electrical recordings were carried out using the IrO2 stereotrodes to detect spontaneous action potentials and LFPs in vivo.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The IrO2 electrodes exhibited significantly higher capacitance and lower impedance at 1 kHz. Electrical recording with the IrO2 stereotrodes in vivo demonstrated an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 7.3 and a significantly improved LFP sensitivity. 5 types of different neurons recorded were clearly separated. Electrophysiological responses to visual and odor stimulation were also detected, respectively.
    

    
  


        Comparison with existing method(s):
      
    

    
      The most widely used electrodes for electrical recording in Drosophila are glass microelectrode and sharpened tungsten microelectrode, which are typically used for single-unit recordings. Although tetrode technology has been used to record multi-neuronal activities from Drosophila, the fabricated IrO2 stereotrodes possess smaller geometry size but exhibited comparable recording signal-to noise ration and better sorting quality.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:

The protein sequence of lysozyme from G. orientalis showed high identity to that of Drosophila melanogaster (51.7 %); however, in contrast to D. melanogaster lysozyme, G. orientalis lysozyme was immune inducible and expressed in a wide range of tissues. Expression of G. orientalis lysozyme mRNA was highest at 8 h post-infection and subsequently decreased with time after bacterial infection. We also expressed G. orientalis lysozyme protein in vitro using the pET expression system. Compared with the negative control, over-expressed G. orientalis lysozyme showed antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis by radial diffusion assay, with minimal inhibitory concentration values of 30.3 and 7.55 ÂµM, respectively. These results indicate that G. orientalis lysozyme may have stronger antimicrobial activity than other lysozymes against a broad range of microorganisms.",2014,"Hyojung Kwon, Kyeongrin Bang, Minsup Lee, Saeyoull Cho, Hyojung Kwon, Kyeongrin Bang, Minsup Lee, Saeyoull Cho"
Age-dependent deterioration of locomotion in Drosophila melanogaster deficient in the homologue of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2,24702731,10.1111/gtc.12146,"Recessive mutations in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 (ALS2) gene have been linked to juvenile-onset ALS2. Although one of the molecular functions of the ALS2 protein is clearly the activation of Rab5, the mechanisms underlying the selective dysfunction and degeneration of motor neurons in vivo remain to be fully understood. Here, we focused on the ALS2 homologue of Drosophila melanogaster, isolated two independent deletions, and systematically compared phenotypes of the mutants with those of animals in which Rab5 function in identified neurons was abrogated. In the dALS2 mutant flies, we found that the stereotypic axonal and dendritic morphologies of neurons shared some features with those in Rab5-deficient flies, but the dALS2 mutant phenotypes were much milder. We also found that the abrogation of Rab5 function in motor neurons strongly depressed the locomotion activity of adults, resembling the behavior of aged dALS2 mutants. Importantly, this age-dependent locomotion deficit of dALS2 mutants was restored to normal by expressing the dALS2 transgene in a wide range of tissues. This finding provided a platform where we could potentially identify particular cell types responsible for the phenotype by tissue-specific rescue experiments. We discuss our results and the future usage of the dALS2 mutant as a new ALS model.",2014,"Yuta Takayama, Reina E Itoh, Taiichi Tsuyama, Tadashi Uemura, Yuta Takayama, Reina E Itoh, Taiichi Tsuyama, Tadashi Uemura"
Interaction of light regimes and circadian clocks modulate timing of pre-adult developmental events in Drosophila,24885932,10.1186/1471-213X-14-19,"Background:
      
    

    
      Circadian clocks have been postulated to regulate development time in several species of insects including fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster. Previously we have reported that selection for faster pre-adult development reduces development time (by ~19 h or ~11%) and clock period (by ~0.5 h), suggesting a role of circadian clocks in the regulation of development time in D. melanogaster. We reasoned that these faster developing flies could serve as a model to study stage-specific interaction of circadian clocks and developmental events with the environmental light/dark (LD) conditions. We assayed the duration of three pre-adult stages in the faster developing (FD) and control (BD) populations under a variety of light regimes that are known to modulate circadian clocks and pre-adult development time of Drosophila to examine the role of circadian clocks in the timing of pre-adult developmental stages.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We find that the duration of pre-adult stages was shorter under constant light (LL) and short period light (L)/dark (D) cycles (L:D = 10:10 h; T20) compared to the standard 24 h day (L:D = 12:12 h; T24), long LD cycles (L:D = 14:14 h; T28) and constant darkness (DD). The difference in the duration of pre-adult stages between the FD and BD populations was significantly smaller under the three LD cycles and LL compared to DD, possibly due to the fact that clocks of both FD and BD flies are driven at the same pace in the three LD regimes owing to circadian entrainment, or are rendered dysfunctional under LL.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      These results suggest that interaction between light regimes and circadian clocks regulate the duration of pre-adult developmental stages in fruit flies D. melanogaster.",2014,"Pankaj Yadav, Madhumohan Thandapani, Vijay Kumar Sharma, Pankaj Yadav, Madhumohan Thandapani, Vijay Kumar Sharma"
Within-group male relatedness reduces harm to females in Drosophila,24463521,10.1038/nature12949,"To resolve the mechanisms that switch competition to cooperation is key to understanding biological organization. This is particularly relevant for intrasexual competition, which often leads to males harming females. Recent theory proposes that kin selection may modulate female harm by relaxing competition among male relatives. Here we experimentally manipulate the relatedness of groups of male Drosophila melanogaster competing over females to demonstrate that, as expected, within-group relatedness inhibits male competition and female harm. Females exposed to groups of three brothers unrelated to the female had higher lifetime reproductive success and slower reproductive ageing compared to females exposed to groups of three males unrelated to each other. Triplets of brothers also fought less with each other, courted females less intensively and lived longer than triplets of unrelated males. However, associations among brothers may be vulnerable to invasion by minorities of unrelated males: when two brothers were matched with an unrelated male, the unrelated male sired on average twice as many offspring as either brother. These results demonstrate that relatedness can profoundly affect fitness through its modulation of intrasexual competition, as flies plastically adjust sexual behaviour in a manner consistent with kin-selection theory.",2014,"Pau Carazo, Cedric K W Tan, Felicity Allen, Stuart Wigby, Tommaso Pizzari, Pau Carazo, Cedric K W Tan, Felicity Allen, Stuart Wigby, Tommaso Pizzari"
Sperm production responds to perceived sperm competition risk in male Drosophila melanogaster,24769021,10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.04.027,"Postcopulatory sexual selection arising from female multiple mating leads to the evolution of ejaculates that maximize a male's reproductive success under sperm competition. Where the risk of sperm competition is variable, optimal fitness may be achieved by plastically altering ejaculate characteristics in response to the prevailing sperm competition environment. In the model species Drosophila melanogaster, males expecting to encounter sperm competition mate for longer and transfer more accessory proteins and sperm. Here we show that after being housed with a single rival for one week, the seminal vesicles of male D. melanogaster contain a significantly greater proportion of live sperm than those of males maintained alone, indicating adaptive adjustment of sperm quality in response to the perceived risk of sperm competition. This effect is due to an increase in the number of live sperm produced, indicating that males upregulate sperm production in response to the presence of rivals. Our data suggest that males show plasticity in the rate of spermatogenesis that is adaptive in the context of a fluctuating sperm competition environment.",2014,"Joshua P Moatt, Calvin Dytham, Michael D F Thom, Joshua P Moatt, Calvin Dytham, Michael D F Thom"
Dietary glucose regulates yeast consumption in adult Drosophila males,25566097,10.3389/fphys.2014.00504,"The adjustment of feeding behavior in response to hunger and satiety contributes to homeostatic regulation in animals. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster feeds on yeasts growing on overripe fruit, providing nutrients required for adult survival, reproduction and larval growth. Here, we present data on how the nutritional value of food affects subsequent yeast consumption in Drosophila adult males. After a period of starvation, flies showed intensive yeast consumption. In comparison, flies stopped feeding after having access to a nutritive cornmeal diet. Interestingly, dietary glucose was equally efficient as the complex cornmeal diet. In contrast, flies fed with sucralose, a non-metabolizable sweetener, behaved as if they were starved. The adipokinetic hormone and insulin-like peptides regulate metabolic processes in insects. We did not find any effect of the adipokinetic hormone pathway on this modulation. Instead, the insulin pathway was involved in these changes. Flies lacking the insulin receptor (InR) did not respond to nutrient deprivation by increasing yeast consumption. Together these results show the importance of insulin in the regulation of yeast consumption in response to starvation in adult D. melanogaster males.",2014,"SÃ©bastien Lebreton, Peter Witzgall, Marie Olsson, Paul G Becher, SÃ©bastien Lebreton, Peter Witzgall, Marie Olsson, Paul G Becher"
"Unlike in Drosophila Meroistic Ovaries, hippo represses notch in Blattella germanica Panoistic ovaries, triggering the mitosis-endocycle switch in the follicular cells",25426635,10.1371/journal.pone.0113850,"During insect oogenesis, the follicular epithelium undergoes both cell proliferation and apoptosis, thus modulating ovarian follicle growth. The Hippo pathway is key in these processes, and has been thoroughly studied in the meroistic ovaries of Drosophila melanogaster. However, nothing is known about the role of the Hippo pathway in primitive panoistic ovaries. This work examines the mRNA expression levels of the main components of the Hippo pathway in the panoistic ovary of the basal insect species Blattella germanica, and demonstrates the function of Hippo through RNAi. In Hippo-depleted specimens, the follicular cells of the basal ovarian follicles proliferate without arresting cytokinesis; the epithelium therefore becomes bilayered, impairing ovarian follicle growth. This phenotype is accompanied by long stalks between the ovarian follicles. In D. melanogaster loss of function of Notch determines that the stalk is not developed. With this in mind, we tested whether Hippo and Notch pathways are related in B. germanica. In Notch (only)-depleted females, no stalks were formed between the ovarian follicles. Simultaneous depletion of Hippo and Notch rescued partially the stalk to wild-type. Unlike in the meroistic ovaries of D. melanogaster, in panoistic ovaries the Hippo pathway appears to regulate follicular cell proliferation by acting as a repressor of Notch, triggering the switch from mitosis to the endocycle in the follicular cells. The phylogenetically basal position of B. germanica suggests that this might be the ancestral function of Hippo in insect ovaries.",2014,"Paula Irles, Maria-Dolors Piulachs, Paula Irles, Maria-Dolors Piulachs"
Effects of light interruption on sleep and viability of Drosophila melanogaster,25148297,10.1371/journal.pone.0105678,"Light is a very important regulator of the daily sleep rhythm. Here, we investigate the influence of nocturnal light stimulation on Drosophila sleep. Results showed that total daytime sleep was reduced due to a decrease in daytime sleep episode duration caused by discontinuous light stimulation, but sleep was not strongly impacted at nighttime although the discontinuous light stimulation occurred during the scotophase. During a subsequent recovery period without light interruption, the sleep quality of nighttime sleep was improved and of daytime sleep reduced, indicating flies have a persistent response to nocturnal light stimulation. Further studies showed that the discontinuous light stimulation damped the daily rhythm of a circadian light-sensitive protein cryptochrome both at the mRNA and protein levels, which subsequently caused disappearance of circadian rhythm of the core oscillator timeless and decrease of TIMLESS protein at nighttime. These data indicate that the nocturnal light interruption plays an important role in sleep through core proteins CRYTOCHROME and TIMLESS, Moreover, interruption of sleep further impacted reproduction and viability.",2014,"Zhenxing Liu, Zhangwu Zhao, Zhenxing Liu, Zhangwu Zhao"

Central brain neurons expressing doublesex regulate female receptivity in Drosophila,24991959,10.1016/j.neuron.2014.05.038,"Drosophila melanogaster females respond to male courtship by either rejecting the male or allowing copulation. The neural mechanisms underlying these female behaviors likely involve the integration of sensory information in the brain. Because doublesex (dsx) controls other aspects of female differentiation, we asked whether dsx-expressing neurons mediate virgin female receptivity to courting males. Using intersectional techniques to manipulate the activities of defined subsets of dsx-expressing neurons, we found that activation of neurons in either the pCd or pC1 clusters promotes receptivity, while silencing these neurons makes females unreceptive. Furthermore, pCd and pC1 neurons physiologically respond to the male-specific pheromone cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), while pC1 neurons also respond to male courtship song. The pCd and pC1 neurons expressing dsx in females do not express transcripts from the fruitless (fru) P1 promoter. Thus, virgin female receptivity is controlled at least in part by neurons that are distinct from those governing male courtship.",2014,"Chuan Zhou, Yufeng Pan, Carmen C Robinett, Geoffrey W Meissner, Bruce S Baker, Chuan Zhou, Yufeng Pan, Carmen C Robinett, Geoffrey W Meissner, Bruce S Baker"
Contrasting influences of Drosophila white/mini-white on ethanol sensitivity in two different behavioral assays,24890118,10.1111/acer.12421,"Background:
      
    

    
      The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been used extensively to investigate genetic mechanisms of ethanol (EtOH)-related behaviors. Many past studies in flies, including studies from our laboratory, have manipulated gene expression using transposons carrying the genetic-phenotypic marker mini-white(mini-w), a derivative of the endogenous gene white(w). Whether the mini-w transgenic marker or the endogenous w gene influences behavioral responses to acute EtOH exposure in flies has not been systematically investigated.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      We manipulated mini-w and w expression via (i) transposons marked with mini-w, (ii) RNAi against mini-w and w, and (iii) a null allele of w. We assessed EtOH sensitivity and tolerance using a previously described eRING assay (based on climbing in the presence of EtOH) and an assay based on EtOH-induced sedation.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In eRING assays, EtOH-induced impairment of climbing correlated inversely with expression of the mini-w marker from a series of transposon insertions. Additionally, flies harboring a null allele of w or flies with RNAi-mediated knockdown of mini-w were significantly more sensitive to EtOH in eRING assays than controls expressing endogenous w or the mini-w marker. In contrast, EtOH sensitivity and rapid tolerance measured in the EtOH sedation assay were not affected by decreased expression of mini-w or endogenous w in flies.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      EtOH sensitivity measured in the eRING assay is noticeably influenced by w and mini-w, making eRING problematic for studies on EtOH-related behavior in Drosophila using transgenes marked with mini-w. In contrast, the EtOH sensitivity assay described here is a suitable behavioral paradigm for studies on EtOH sensitivity and rapid tolerance in Drosophila including those that use widely available transgenes marked with mini-w.",2014,"Robin F Chan, Lara Lewellyn, Jacqueline M DeLoyht, Kristyn Sennett, Scarlett Coffman, Matthew Hewitt, Jill C Bettinger, John M Warrick, Mike Grotewiel, Robin F Chan, Lara Lewellyn, Jacqueline M DeLoyht, Kristyn Sennett, Scarlett Coffman, Matthew Hewitt, Jill C Bettinger, John M Warrick, Mike Grotewiel"
Faster evolving Drosophila paralogs lose expression rate and ubiquity and accumulate more non-synonymous SNPs,24438455,10.1186/1745-6150-9-2,"Background:
      
    

    
      Duplicated genes can indefinately persist in genomes if either both copies retain the original function due to dosage benefit (gene conservation), or one of the copies assumes a novel function (neofunctionalization), or both copies become required to perform the function previously accomplished by a single copy (subfunctionalization), or through a combination of these mechanisms. Different models of duplication retention imply different predictions about substitution rates in the coding portion of paralogs and about asymmetry of these rates.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We analyse sequence evolution asymmetry in paralogs present in 12 Drosophila genomes using the nearest non-duplicated orthologous outgroup as a reference. Those paralogs present in D. melanogaster are analysed in conjunction with the asymmetry of expression rate and ubiquity and of segregating non-synonymous polymorphisms in the same paralogs. Paralogs accumulate substitutions, on average, faster than their nearest singleton orthologs. The distribution of paralogs' substitution rate asymmetry is overdispersed relative to that of orthologous clades, containing disproportionally more unusually symmetric and unusually asymmetric clades. We show that paralogs are more asymmetric in: a) clades orthologous to highly constrained singleton genes; b) genes with high expression level; c) genes with ubiquitous expression and d) non-tandem duplications. We further demonstrate that, in each asymmetrically evolving pair of paralogs, the faster evolving member of the pair tends to have lower average expression rate, lower expression uniformity and higher frequency of non-synonymous SNPs than its slower evolving counterpart.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that many duplications in Drosophila are retained despite stabilising selection being more relaxed in one of the paralogs than in the other, suggesting a widespread unfinished pseudogenization. This phenomenon is likely to make detection of neo- and subfunctionalization signatures difficult, as these models of duplication retention also predict asymmetries in substitution rates and expression profiles.",2014,"Lev Y Yampolsky, Michael A Bouzinier, Lev Y Yampolsky, Michael A Bouzinier"

However, the roles of neuroligin3 (dnlg3) in synaptic development and function have not been determined. In this study, we used the Drosophila neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) as a model system to investigate the in vivo role of dnlg3. We showed that DNlg3 was expressed in both the CNS and NMJs where it was largely restricted to the postsynaptic site. We generated dnlg3 mutants and showed that these mutants exhibited an increased bouton number and reduced bouton size compared with the wild-type (WT) controls. Consistent with alterations in bouton properties, pre- and postsynaptic differentiations were affected in dnlg3 mutants. This included abnormal synaptic vesicle endocytosis, increased postsynaptic density length, and reduced GluRIIA recruitment.

What determines host acceptance and suitability in tropical Asian Drosophila parasitoids?,24472204,10.1603/EN13141,"For successful parasitism, parasitoid females must oviposit and the progeny must develop in individual hosts. Here, we investigated the determinants of host acceptance for oviposition and host suitability for larval development of Drosophila parasitoids from Bogor and Kota Kinabalu (??,800 km northeast of Bogor), Indonesia, in tropical Asia. Asobara pleuralis (Ashmead) from both localities oviposited frequently (>60%) in all of the drosophilid species tested, except the strain from Kota Kinabalu oviposited rarely (10%) in Drosophila eugracilis Bock & Wheeler. Leptopilina victoriae Nordlander from both localities only oviposited frequently (>77%) in species from the Drosophila melanogaster species group except D. eugracilis (<3.7%), whereas Leptopilina pacifica Novkovi? & Kimura from Bogor oviposited frequently (>85%) only in species from the Drosophila immigrans species group. Thus, host acceptance appeared to be affected by host taxonomy, at least in Leptopilina species. Host suitability varied considerably, even among closely related drosophilid species, which suggests that the host suitability is at least in part independent of host taxonomy and that it has been determined via parasitoid-host coevolutionary interactions (i.e., arms race). Host acceptance did not always coincide with host suitability, i.e., parasitoids sometimes oviposited in unsuitable host species. Geographic origin strongly affected the host acceptance and suitability in the A. pleuralis-D. eugracilis parasitoid-host pair, whereas it only weakly affected the acceptability and suitability in other parasitoid-host combinations.",2014,"Masahito T Kimura, Awit Suwito, Masahito T Kimura, Awit Suwito"

A measure of comparison is based on matrix similarity. The approach developed was applied to analysis of the genomes of Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Decreased accumulation of cadmium in Drosophila selected for resistance suggests a mechanism independent of metallothionein,24929542,10.1007/s12011-014-0037-1,"Heavy metals, including cadmium, are common contaminants in environments subject to human activity. Responses to exposure in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, are dosage-dependent and resistance is selectable.

To address this need, we have selected wild-type flies for cadmium resistance for 20 generations and tested metal content using mass spectrometry. Resistant flies were observed to contain lower levels of cadmium, arguing for a mechanism of cadmium resistance that is not mediated by increased sequestration. This, coupled with genetic evidence suggesting the involvement of factors located on the X chromosome, suggests a gene other than metallothionein may be involved in resistance in this line.",2014,"Austin H Nguyen, Laura E Altomare, M Catharine McElwain, Austin H Nguyen, Laura E Altomare, M Catharine McElwain"

In each species all three transcripts start at or about the same place within the unique portion of the gene. The longest transcript (approximately 9-10 kilobases) continues through several kilobases of short tandem repeats. The two shorter (1.9 and 1.2 kilobases) transcripts terminate 5' to the repeats. The repeat sequences are strongly conserved within a species but between species they have diverged both in length and in sequence. The longest homology is 9 nucleotides. The unique portions have also diverged significantly but do have some regions of conserved sequence. In both species the cytoplasmic transcript is spliced and polyadenylated but does not appear to contain a significant open reading frame.

Variation and genomic localization of genes encoding Drosophila melanogaster male accessory gland proteins separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,3095182,,"Accessory gland proteins from Drosophila melanogaster males have been separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis into nine major bands.

Variation was observed not only among long-established laboratory strains but also among stocks recently derived from natural populations. There was little difference in the amount of variation between P and M strains, indicating that P element mutagenesis is not a factor producing the variation. Codominant expression of variants for each of five bands was found in heterozygotes, suggesting structural gene variation and not posttranslational modification variation. Stocks carrying electrophoretic variants of four of the major proteins were used to map the presumed structural genes for these proteins; the loci were found to be dispersed on the second chromosome. Since males homozygous for variant proteins were fertile, the polymorphism seems to have little immediate effect on successful sperm transfer.

It is also at least necessary for the high-frequency oscillations normally produced by courting males as they vibrate their wings. The entirety of the 4.5-kb transcript is not necessary for rather strong rhythmicity; nor does it seem to be sufficient, in transformants, for wild-type behavioral phenotypes.

"Bands, interbands and puffs in native Drosophila polytene chromosomes are recognized by a monoclonal antibody to an epitope in the carboxy-terminal tail of histone H1",2483366,10.1007/BF00292786,"A monoclonal antibody was raised against Drosophila melanogaster histone H1. Immunoscreening of proteolytic cleavage fragments of H1 and of a set of all possible overlapping synthetic octapeptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of H1, revealed that the antibody recognizes an epitope within the sequence 207VTAAKPKA214 near the centre of the carboxy-terminal tail. This antibody gives positive immunofluorescence over the entire length of native D. melanogaster polytene chromosomes isolated from salivary glands by microdissection at physiological pH and ionic strength. Bands, interbands and puffs are all seen to contain H1. The immunofluorescence over puffs, albeit lower than that over bands and interbands, indicates that chromatin decondensation can occur without complete loss of H1 in these structures. The reaction of the antibody with bands suggests that the segment of the C-terminal tail containing the epitope may be exposed in the condensed 30 nm chromatin filament.",1989,"R J Hill, F Watt, C M Wilson, T Fifis, P A Underwood, G Tribbick, H M Geysen, J O Thomas, R J Hill, F Watt, C M Wilson, T Fifis, P A Underwood, G Tribbick, H M Geysen, J O Thomas"
Ca2(+)-dependent proteolytic modification of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in Drosophila wild-type and dunce memory mutants,2560483,10.3109/01677068909107104,"Two cAMP-dependent protein kinases with different activation constants were separated from Drosophila melanogaster head extracts. Both are only found in nervous tissue. The first cAMP-dependent kinase, with Mr = 190,000, has been already characterized as tetrameric Drosophila type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase R2C2. The second purified cAMP-dependent protein kinase, with Mr = 80,000, is dimeric in structure RPC, and the cAMP-concentration required for half maximal activation is 4 fold lower than for the type II kinase. The generation of RP can be stimulated in vitro by addition of exogenous calcium and is due to an endogenous Ca2(+)-dependent protease that selectively degrades the regulatory subunit. Extraction in the presence of various protease inhibitors does not affect the amounts of RP, suggesting that the observed quantitative change in RP occurs in vivo. The amounts of RP in the nervous tissue of the memory mutants dunce1 and dunce2, which have increased cAMP levels, are different from the amount of RP in wild-type flies. Also treatments of wild-type flies with drugs affecting cAMP-metabolism and acetylcholine levels led to amounts of RP different from untreated flies.",1989,"U MÃ¼ller, H C Spatz, U MÃ¼ller, H C Spatz"

Such repeats may also be located in the intercalary heterochromatin site 12E of the X chromosome. Chromosomal heterochromatic regions are enriched with one of the two main genomic variants of MDG1, MDG1het, identifiable by EcoRI restriction.

A mutation that changes cell movement and cell fate in the zebrafish embryo,2911386,10.1038/337358a0,"The study of developmental patterning has been facilitated by the availability of mutations that produce changes in cell fate, in animals such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. We now describe a zygotic lethal mutation in the zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio, that also changes how particular embryonic cells develop. Severe pattern deficiencies are observed that are restricted to a single body region, the trunk. The mutation may directly affect mesoderm, as somites do not form in the trunk. Head and tail structures, including tail somites, are relatively undisturbed. The earliest detected expression of the mutation is during gastrulation, when movements of mesodermal cells occur incorrectly. We injected prospective trunk mesodermal cells with lineage tracer dye and observed that in mutants these cells may enter a new body region, the tail, and there may express a new fate appropriate for the changed position.",1989,"C B Kimmel, D A Kane, C Walker, R M Warga, M B Rothman, C B Kimmel, D A Kane, C Walker, R M Warga, M B Rothman"

Significant effects of the alpha Gpdh locus on rate of development under competitive conditions (SS greater than FS greater than SS), and of the Adh locus on egg hatchability (FF = SS greater than FS) and egg-to-adult survival under competitive conditions (FF greater than SS = FS) were revealed. Possible natural selection mechanisms involved in the maintenance of allozyme polymorphisms at the alpha Gpdh and Adh loci are described.

The Drosophila proteasome undergoes changes in its subunit pattern during development,2491814,10.1016/0014-4827(89)90228-0,"The two-dimensional electrophoretic protein subunit pattern of the proteasome, which is a mulifunctional non-lysosomal proteinase, was analyzed throughout the development of Drosophila melanogaster. The experiments show that the proteasome is already present in early embryos and its characteristic gross morphology as judged by the outer diameter of 12 nm and the inner depression of 3 nm remains unaltered. The electrophoretic analysis of the enzyme subunits demonstrates that the proteasome undergoes, dependent on development, alterations in its protein composition. The most simple subunit pattern is observed in Schneider's S-3 tissue culture cells and early embryos while with ongoing fly development the subunit pattern of the proteasome becomes increasingly complex. 32P-Labeling and immunoblotting experiments indicate that post-translational modification of the subunits must in part be responsible for the development-dependent diversification of the subunit pattern. Our data raise the possibility that the in vivo proteolytic activity and the in vivo substrate specificity of the proteasome may be regulated by modification of its subunit composition during fly development.",1989,"C Haass, P M Kloetzel, C Haass, P M Kloetzel"

Selection for increased desiccation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster: additive genetic control and correlated responses for other stresses,2503423,,"Previously we found that Drosophila melanogaster lines selected for increased desiccation resistance have lowered metabolic rate and behavioral activity levels, and show correlated responses for resistance to starvation and a toxic ethanol level. These results were consistent with a prediction that increased resistance to many environmental stresses may be genetically correlated because of a reduction in metabolic energy expenditure. Here we present experiments on the genetic basis of the selection response and extend the study of correlated responses to other stresses. The response to selection was not sex-specific and involved X-linked and autosomal genes acting additively. Activity differences contributed little to differences in desiccation resistance between selected and control lines. Selected lines had lower metabolic rates than controls in darkness when activity was inhibited. Adults from selected lines showed increased resistance to a heat shock, 60Co-gamma-radiation, and acute ethanol and acetic acid stress. The desiccation, ethanol and starvation resistance of isofemale lines set up from the F2s of a cross between one of the selected and one of the control lines were correlated.

Ten restriction-site and four length polymorphisms (two insertions and two deletions) were detected. Contrary to the predicted lower level of variation for genes on the X chromosome, the level of variation attributable to nucleotide substitution (estimated heterozygosity/nucleotide = 0.004) was similar to that previously reported for autosomal loci. The amount of insertion/deletion variation in the studied region was within the range observed in autosomal regions and thus not explainable by a simple selection model against the effects of insertional mutations.

Nucleolar dominance and replicative dominance in Drosophila interspecific hybrids,2511070,,"The replication of the rDNA complement of only one nucleolus organizer region during polytene chromosome formation (replicative dominance) was initially observed in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we demonstrate replicative dominance in Drosophila simulans and D. melanogaster/D. simulans interspecific hybrids. A second nucleolar phenomenon, nucleolar dominance, is observed in the diploid tissue of interspecific hybrids. In this case only one of two nucleolus organizer regions forms a nucleolus. However, reorganizations of the X chromosome heterochromatin which eliminate nucleolar dominance have no apparent effect on the expression of replicative dominance. These observations lead us to conclude that nucleolar dominance and replicative dominance are operationally separable functions influencing the rDNAs, and may be determined by differing regulatory events.",1989,"C Goodrich-Young, H M Krider"

Three classes of transcripts were shown to differ only in the 3'-end and to code for three protein isoforms each with a different C-terminal amino acid sequence. Each transcript is shown to arise through the differential expression of three isotype-specific exons at the 3'-end of the gene by a developmentally regulated process of 3'-end formation and alternate splicing pathways of the pre-mRNA. In contrast, the 5'-end of the gene is simple in structure and each mRNA is transcribed from the same promoter sequence.

"Genotype-by-environment and epistatic interactions in Drosophila melanogaster: the effects of Gpdh allozymes, genetic background and rearing temperature on larval developmental time and viability",2503425,,"The possible role of temperature as a component of natural selection generating the latitudinal clines in Gpdh allele frequencies in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster was examined. Effects of rearing temperature (16 degrees, 22 degrees and 29 degrees) and of Gpdh allozymes (S and F) on larval developmental time and viability were measured. Eight genetic backgrounds from each of three populations (continents) were used to assess the generality of any effects. Analyses of variance indicated significant temperature effects and allozyme-by-genetic background interaction effects for both characters. Viability showed significant genetic background effects, as well as significant temperature-by-allozyme and temperature-by-allozyme-by-population interactions. In general, the S/S genotype was significantly lower in viability than the F/F and F/S genotypes at extreme temperatures (16 degrees and 29 degrees), with no significant differences at 22 degrees. However, each population had a slightly different pattern of viability associated with temperature, and only the Australian population showed a pattern that could contribute to the observed cline formation. Although the same two interactions were not significant for developmental time, examination of the means showed that the S/S genotype had a slightly faster rate of development at 16 degrees than the F/F genotype in all populations (by an average of 0.25 day or 1.1%). The low temperature effect on developmental time is consistent with the clines observed in nature, with the S allele increasing in frequency with higher latitudes. The results for both viability and developmental time are consistent with the interpretation of Gpdh as a minor polygene affecting physiological phenotypes, as indicated by previous work with adult flight metabolism. Finally, it is proposed that the temperature-dependent antagonistic effects of the allozymes on viability vs. developmental time and flight metabolism may be the underlying force giving rise to the worldwide polymorphism.",1989,"P T Barnes, B Holland, V Courreges, P T Barnes, B Holland, V Courreges"
Effect of glyoxal pretreatment on radiation-induced genetic damage in Drosophila melanogaster,2499775,10.1016/0027-5107(89)90069-9,"The effects of glyoxal and of glyoxal pretreatments on radiation-induced genetic damage were investigated in Drosophila melanogaster mature sperm, by means of sex-linked recessive and dominant lethality, reciprocal translocation and chromosome loss tests. In addition, the possible mutagenic effect of glyoxal was assessed in postmeiotic cells up to 7 days after treatment. The results obtained show: (1) the frequencies of recessive lethals after glyoxal treatment were within control values, (2) no clastogenic effect of glyoxal was observed, (3) glyoxal pretreatment did not modify the frequency of recessive lethals induced by X-rays, (4) after pretreatment with glyoxal a consistent, though not significant, increase was seen in the frequency of reciprocal translocations in 3 replicate experiments, (5) the yield of dominant lethals and of complete and partial chromosome loss induced by radiation was significantly increased by pretreatments with glyoxal. It is suggested that the increase of the frequency of genetic endpoints resulting from chromosome breakage, when glyoxal was administered prior to irradiation, could be ascribed to: (a) a sensitizing action of glyoxal to the clastogenic effect of ionizing radiation; (b) the formation of reactive species by the interaction of glyoxal with radiation; and/or (c) interference of glyoxal with the normal handling of radiation-induced lesions in mature postmeiotic male cells.",1989,"B Mazar Barnett, E R MuÃ±oz, B Mazar Barnett, E R MuÃ±oz"

Because such movement is often detectable by an increased mutation rate, I studied the effect of interspecific hybridization in the Drosophila melanogaster group on the mutation rate of X-linked visibles. This rate did not differ between hybrids and intraspecific controls. This was also true for the germ-line excision rate of a transposable element, although the rate of somatic excision was two to sixfold higher in hybrids than in pure species.

Sequence analysis of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced vermilion mutations in Drosophila melanogaster,2572507,,"The mutational specificity of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) was determined in Drosophila melanogaster using the vermilion locus as a target gene. 25 mutants (16 F1 and 9 F2 mutants) were cloned and sequenced. Only base-pair changes were observed; three of the mutants represented double base substitutions. Transition mutations were the most prominent sequence change: 61% were GC----AT and 18% AT----GC substitutions. Both sequence changes can be explained by the miscoding properties of the modified guanine and thymine bases. A strong bias of neighboring bases on the occurrence of the GC----AT transitions or a strand preference of both types of transition mutations was not observed. The spectrum of ENU mutations in D. melanogaster includes a significant fraction (21%) of transversion mutations. Our data indicate that like in other prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems also in D. melanogaster the O6-ethylguanine adduct is the most prominent premutational lesion after ENU treatment. The strong contribution of the O6-ethylguanine adduct to the mutagenicity of ENU possibly explains the absence of distinct difference between the type of mutations observed in the F1 and F2 mutants. Although the latter arise later during development, the spectrum of mosaic mutations is also dominated by GC----AT transition mutations.",1989,"A Pastink, C Vreeken, M J Nivard, L L Searles, E W Vogel, A Pastink, C Vreeken, M J Nivard, L L Searles, E W Vogel"

Labellar Desi expression was significantly elevated under arid conditions, accompanied by an increase in water ingestion by adults. Desi overexpression also promoted water ingestion. In contrast, a knockdown of Desi expression reduced feeding as well as water ingestion due to a drastic decrease in the gustatory sensillar sensitivity for all tested tastants.

Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis and developmental transitions may provide an attractive system to study the biological and environmental effects of NMs on the embryonic development. In this study, the effects of three types of magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles (MNPs): UN-MNPs (pristine), CA-MNPs (citric acid modified) and APTS-MNPs (3-aminopropyltriethoxylsilane coated) on the development of Drosophila at 300 and 600 Î¼g/g dosage were studied. The uptake of MNPs by female and male flies caused obvious reduction in the female fecundity, and the developmental delay at the egg-pupae and pupae-adult transitions, especially in those treated by the positive APTS-MNPs. Further investigation demonstrates that the parental uptake of MNPs disturbs the oogenesis period, induces ovarian defect, reduces the length of eggs, decreases the number of nurse cells and delays egg chamber development, which may contribute to the decrease of fecundity of female Drosophila and the development delay of their offspring.

The relevance of such specific genomic arrangements of regulatory elements remains unclear. Deletions of individual BE-PRE combination result in distinct homeotic phenotypes. In this study, we show that deletion of two such BE-PRE combinations in cis leads to new genetic interactions, which manifests as dorsal closure defect phenotype in adult abdominal epithelia. We further demonstrate that dorsal closure phenotype results from enhanced and ectopic expression of Hox gene Abd-B in the larval epithelial cells. This suggests a specific role of multiple BE-PRE combinations in the larval epithelial cells for regulation of Abd-B. Using chromosome conformation capture experiments, we show that genetic interactions correlate with direct physical interactions among the BE-PRE combinations.

Partial genomic screens of ??,000 genes yield ??60 hyperglycaemia 'flyabetes' candidates that we classify using fat body- and muscle-specific knockdown and biochemical assays. The results highlight the minor glucose fraction as a physiological indicator of metabolism in Drosophila. The hits uncovered in our screen may have conserved functions in mammalian glucose homeostasis, as heterozygous and homozygous mutants of Ck1alpha in the murine adipose lineage, develop diabetes.

Nesprin provides elastic properties to muscle nuclei by cooperating with spectraplakin and EB1,26008743,10.1083/jcb.201408098,"Muscle nuclei are exposed to variable cytoplasmic strain produced by muscle contraction and relaxation, but their morphology remains stable. Still, the mechanism responsible for maintaining myonuclear architecture, and its importance, is currently elusive. Herein, we uncovered a unique myonuclear scaffold in Drosophila melanogaster larval muscles, exhibiting both elastic features contributed by the stretching capacity of MSP300 (nesprin) and rigidity provided by a perinuclear network of microtubules stabilized by Shot (spectraplakin) and EB1. Together, they form a flexible perinuclear shield that protects myonuclei from intrinsic or extrinsic forces. The loss of this scaffold resulted in significantly aberrant nuclear morphology and subsequently reduced levels of essential nuclear factors such as lamin A/C, lamin B, and HP1. Overall, we propose a novel mechanism for maintaining myonuclear morphology and reveal its critical link to correct levels of nuclear factors in differentiated muscle fibers. These findings may shed light on the underlying mechanism of various muscular dystrophies.",2015,"Shuoshuo Wang, Adriana Reuveny, Talila Volk, Shuoshuo Wang, Adriana Reuveny, Talila Volk"
The microtubule catastrophe promoter Sentin delays stable kinetochore-microtubule attachment in oocytes,26668329,10.1083/jcb.201507006,"The critical step in meiosis is to attach homologous chromosomes to the opposite poles. In mouse oocytes, stable microtubule end-on attachments to kinetochores are not established until hours after spindle assembly, and phosphorylation of kinetochore proteins by Aurora B/C is responsible for the delay. Here we demonstrated that microtubule ends are actively prevented from stable attachment to kinetochores until well after spindle formation in Drosophila melanogaster oocytes. We identified the microtubule catastrophe-promoting complex Sentin-EB1 as a major factor responsible for this delay. Without this activity, microtubule ends precociously form robust attachments to kinetochores in oocytes, leading to a high proportion of homologous kinetochores stably attached to the same pole. Therefore, regulation of microtubule ends provides an alternative novel mechanism to delay stable kinetochore-microtubule attachment in oocytes.",2015,"A Agata G?uszek, C Fiona Cullen, Wenjing Li, Rachel A Battaglia, Sarah J Radford, Mariana F Costa, Kim S McKim, Gohta Goshima, Hiroyuki Ohkura, A Agata G?uszek, C Fiona Cullen, Wenjing Li, Rachel A Battaglia, Sarah J Radford, Mariana F Costa, Kim S McKim, Gohta Goshima, Hiroyuki Ohkura"
The complex contributions of genetics and nutrition to immunity in Drosophila melanogaster,25764027,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005030,"Both malnutrition and undernutrition can lead to compromised immune defense in a diversity of animals, and ""nutritional immunology"" has been suggested as a means of understanding immunity and determining strategies for fighting infection. The genetic basis for the effects of diet on immunity, however, has been largely unknown. In the present study, we have conducted genome-wide association mapping in Drosophila melanogaster to identify the genetic basis for individual variation in resistance, and for variation in immunological sensitivity to diet (genotype-by-environment interaction, or GxE). D. melanogaster were reared for several generations on either high-glucose or low-glucose diets and then infected with Providencia rettgeri, a natural bacterial pathogen of D. melanogaster. Systemic pathogen load was measured at the peak of infection intensity, and several indicators of nutritional status were taken from uninfected flies reared on each diet. We find that dietary glucose level significantly alters the quality of immune defense, with elevated dietary glucose resulting in higher pathogen loads. The quality of immune defense is genetically variable within the sampled population, and we find genetic variation for immunological sensitivity to dietary glucose (genotype-by-diet interaction). Immune defense was genetically correlated with indicators of metabolic status in flies reared on the high-glucose diet, and we identified multiple genes that explain variation in immune defense, including several that have not been previously implicated in immune response but which are confirmed to alter pathogen load after RNAi knockdown. Our findings emphasize the importance of dietary composition to immune defense and reveal genes outside the conventional ""immune system"" that can be important in determining susceptibility to infection. Functional variation in these genes is segregating in a natural population, providing the substrate for evolutionary response to pathogen pressure in the context of nutritional environment.",2015,"Robert L Unckless, Susan M Rottschaefer, Brian P Lazzaro, Robert L Unckless, Susan M Rottschaefer, Brian P Lazzaro"
P1 interneurons promote a persistent internal state that enhances inter-male aggression in Drosophila,26714106,10.7554/eLife.11346,"How brains are hardwired to produce aggressive behavior, and how aggression circuits are related to those that mediate courtship, is not well understood. A large-scale screen for aggression-promoting neurons in Drosophila identified several independent hits that enhanced both inter-male aggression and courtship. Genetic intersections revealed that 8-10 P1 interneurons, previously thought to exclusively control male courtship, were sufficient to promote fighting. Optogenetic experiments indicated that P1 activation could promote aggression at a threshold below that required for wing extension. P1 activation in the absence of wing extension triggered persistent aggression via an internal state that could endure for minutes. High-frequency P1 activation promoted wing extension and suppressed aggression during photostimulation, whereas aggression resumed and wing extension was inhibited following photostimulation offset. Thus, P1 neuron activation promotes a latent, internal state that facilitates aggression and courtship, and controls the overt expression of these social behaviors in a threshold-dependent, inverse manner.",2015,"Eric D Hoopfer, Yonil Jung, Hidehiko K Inagaki, Gerald M Rubin, David J Anderson, Eric D Hoopfer, Yonil Jung, Hidehiko K Inagaki, Gerald M Rubin, David J Anderson"
Food odors trigger Drosophila males to deposit a pheromone that guides aggregation and female oviposition decisions,26422512,10.7554/eLife.08688,"Animals use olfactory cues for navigating complex environments. Food odors in particular provide crucial information regarding potential foraging sites. Many behaviors occur at food sites, yet how food odors regulate such behaviors at these sites is unclear. Using Drosophila melanogaster as an animal model, we found that males deposit the pheromone 9-tricosene upon stimulation with the food-odor apple cider vinegar. This pheromone acts as a potent aggregation pheromone and as an oviposition guidance cue for females. We use genetic, molecular, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches to show that 9-tricosene activates antennal basiconic Or7a receptors, a receptor activated by many alcohols and aldehydes such as the green leaf volatile E2-hexenal. We demonstrate that loss of Or7a positive neurons or the Or7a receptor abolishes aggregation behavior and oviposition site-selection towards 9-tricosene and E2-hexenal. 9-Tricosene thus functions via Or7a to link food-odor perception with aggregation and egg-laying decisions.",2015,"Chun-Chieh Lin, Katharine A Prokop-Prigge, George Preti, Christopher J Potter, Chun-Chieh Lin, Katharine A Prokop-Prigge, George Preti, Christopher J Potter"
A test of genetic models for the evolutionary maintenance of same-sex sexual behaviour,26019160,10.1098/rspb.2015.0429,"The evolutionary maintenance of same-sex sexual behaviour (SSB) has received increasing attention because it is perceived to be an evolutionary paradox. The genetic basis of SSB is almost wholly unknown in non-human animals, though this is key to understanding its persistence. Recent theoretical work has yielded broadly applicable predictions centred on two genetic models for SSB: overdominance and sexual antagonism. Using Drosophila melanogaster, we assayed natural genetic variation for male SSB and empirically tested predictions about the mode of inheritance and fitness consequences of alleles influencing its expression. We screened 50 inbred lines derived from a wild population for male-male courtship and copulation behaviour, and examined crosses between the lines for evidence of overdominance and antagonistic fecundity selection. Consistent variation among lines revealed heritable genetic variation for SSB, but the nature of the genetic variation was complex. Phenotypic and fitness variation was consistent with expectations under overdominance, although predictions of the sexual antagonism model were also supported. We found an unexpected and strong paternal effect on the expression of SSB, suggesting possible Y-linkage of the trait. Our results inform evolutionary genetic mechanisms that might maintain low but persistently observed levels of male SSB in D. melanogaster, but highlight a need for broader taxonomic representation in studies of its evolutionary causes.",2015,"Jessica L Hoskins, Michael G Ritchie, Nathan W Bailey, Jessica L Hoskins, Michael G Ritchie, Nathan W Bailey"
Morphological Markers for Cryopreservation in the Embryonic Development of Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae),26470330,10.1093/jee/tov114,"Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae) is an invasive pest recently reported in Europe whose spread into new areas has caused severe economic damage to many agricultural crops. There are serious concerns about the currently available chemical insecticides because of their low efficacy in controlling the species and their environmental impact; so, several studies have focused on environmentally safe strategies. The sterile insect technique (SIT), which requires colony maintenance in laboratory and production of large numbers of live animals, can be utilized in pest management programs and could be integrated with other control strategies if the potential risks associated with the rearing and maintenance of the insect line under laboratory conditions are given sufficient attention. In this regard, the ability to cryobiologically preserve such stocks would be of substantial value. Important prerequisites for long-term cryopreservation are determination of the embryonic stages, identification of specific embryonic stages, and knowledge of development time. This paper describes the main visible markers for the different stages of embryonic development and determines the timing of development at 25Â°C. D. suzukii embryogenesis lasts 23-25 h at 25Â°C and can be divided into 17 stages defined by specific morphological markers. The point at which 50% of embryos are at Stage 14 and 50% are at Stage 15, the most tolerant stages for cryopreservation treatment, as ascertained for Drosophila melanogaster Meigen in prior studies, is reached in 14-15 h. The efficiency of this procedure might be impaired by the retention of eggs in the oviducts, making it impossible to determine the stage of embryonic development for ??5% of laid eggs.",2015,"Silvia Landi, Elisabetta Gargani, Francesco Paoli, Sauro Simoni, Pio Federico Roversi, Silvia Landi, Elisabetta Gargani, Francesco Paoli, Sauro Simoni, Pio Federico Roversi"
Complex patterns of cis-regulatory polymorphisms in ebony underlie standing pigmentation variation in Drosophila melanogaster,26503353,10.1111/mec.13432,"Pigmentation traits in adult Drosophila melanogaster were used in this study to investigate how phenotypic variations in continuous ecological traits can be maintained in a natural population. First, pigmentation variation in the adult female was measured at seven different body positions in 20 strains from the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) originating from a natural population in North Carolina. Next, to assess the contributions of cis-regulatory polymorphisms of the genes involved in the melanin biosynthesis pathway, allele-specific expression levels of four genes were quantified by amplicon sequencing using a 454 GS Junior. Among those genes, ebony was significantly associated with pigmentation intensity of the thoracic segment. Detailed sequence analysis of the gene regulatory regions of this gene indicated that many different functional cis-regulatory alleles are segregating in the population and that variations outside the core enhancer element could potentially play important roles in the regulation of gene expression. In addition, a slight enrichment of distantly associated SNP pairs was observed in the ~10 kb cis-regulatory region of ebony, which suggested the presence of interacting elements scattered across the region. In contrast, sequence analysis in the core cis-regulatory region of tan indicated that SNPs within the region are significantly associated with allele-specific expression level of this gene. Collectively, the data suggest that the underlying genetic differences in the cis-regulatory regions that control intraspecific pigmentation variation can be more complex than those of interspecific pigmentation trait differences, where causal genetic changes are typically confined to modular enhancer elements.",2015,"Ryutaro Miyagi, Noriyoshi Akiyama, Naoki Osada, Aya Takahashi, Ryutaro Miyagi, Noriyoshi Akiyama, Naoki Osada, Aya Takahashi"
Influence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on Drosophila melanogaster longevity,26305987,10.18632/oncotarget.5118,"Most age-related diseases and aging itself are associated with chronic inflammation.

The effect of the lifespan increase was associated with decrease of fecundity. Depending on the concentration, NSAIDs demonstrated both anti- and pro-oxidant properties in Drosophila tissues. However, we failed to identify clear correlation between antioxidant properties of NSAIDs and their pro-longevity effects. The lifespan extending effects of APHS, SC-58125, valeroyl salicylate, trans-resveratrol, valdecoxib, and licofelone were more pronounced in males, valdecoxib and aspirin - in females.

"Egg Viability, Mating Frequency and Male Mating Ability Evolve in Populations of Drosophila melanogaster Selected for Resistance to Cold Shock",26065704,10.1371/journal.pone.0129992,"Background:
      
    

    
      Ability to resist temperature shock is an important component of fitness of insects and other ectotherms. Increased resistance to temperature shock is known to affect life-history traits. Temperature shock is also known to affect reproductive traits such as mating ability and viability of gametes. Therefore selection for increased temperature shock resistance can affect the evolution of reproductive traits.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      We selected replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster for resistance to cold shock. We then investigated the evolution of reproductive behavior along with other components of fitness- larval survivorship, adult mortality, fecundity, egg viability in these populations.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We found that larval survivorship, adult mortality and fecundity post cold shock were not significantly different between selected and control populations. However, compared to the control populations, the selected populations laid significantly higher percentage of fertile eggs (egg viability) 24 hours post cold shock. The selected populations had higher mating frequency both with and without cold shock. After being subjected to cold shock, males from the selected populations successfully mated with significantly more non-virgin females and sired significantly more progeny compared to control males.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      A number of studies have reported the evolution of survivorship in response to selection for temperature shock resistance. Our results clearly indicate that adaptation to cold shock can involve changes in components of reproductive fitness.

Twilight dominates over moonlight in adjusting Drosophila's activity pattern,25838418,10.1177/0748730415575245,"Light is the most important zeitgeber for the synchronization of the Drosophila melanogaster circadian clock. In nature, there is twilight, and the nights are rarely completely dark, a fact that is usually disregarded in lab experiments. Recent studies showed contrary effects of simulated twilight and moonlight on fly locomotor activity, with twilight shifting morning and evening activity into the day and moonlight shifting it into the night. A currently unanswered question is, what may happen to locomotor activity when flies are exposed to more natural conditions in which both moonlight and twilight are simulated? Our data demonstrate that flies are able to integrate twilight and moonlight. However, twilight seems to dominate over moonlight as both, morning and evening activity peaks, take place at dawn or at dusk, respectively, and not during the night. Furthermore, nocturnal activity decreases in the presence of twilight. The compound eyes are essential for this behavior, and by investigating different photoreceptor mutants, we unraveled the importance of photoreceptor cells 7 and 8 for wild-type phases of the activity peaks. To adjust nocturnal activity levels to a wild-type manner, all photoreceptor cells work together in a complex way, with rhodopsin 6 having a prominent role.",2015,"Matthias Schlichting, Rudi Grebler, Pamela Menegazzi, Charlotte Helfrich-FÃ¶rster, Matthias Schlichting, Rudi Grebler, Pamela Menegazzi, Charlotte Helfrich-FÃ¶rster"
Assaying Visual Memory in the Desert Locust,26463192,10.3390/insects6020409,"The involvement of associative learning cues has been demonstrated in several stages of feeding and food selection.

While Drosophila mainly relies on olfactory perception in its food searching behavior, locust foraging behavior is likely to be more visually orientated. Furthermore, a feeding-dependent regulation of Schgr-sNPF transcript levels has previously been observed in the optic lobes of the locust brain, suggesting a possible involvement in visual perception of food and visual associative memory in this insect species. In this study, we describe the development of a robust and reproducible assay allowing visual associative memory to be studied in the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria.

Natural variation of gene models in Drosophila melanogaster,25888292,10.1186/s12864-015-1415-6,"Background:
      
    

    
      Variation within splicing regulatory sequences often leads to differences in gene models among individuals within a species. Two alleles of the same gene may express transcripts with different exon/intron structures and consequently produce functionally different proteins. Matching genomic and transcriptomic data allows us to identify putative regulatory variants associated with changes in splicing patterns.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here we analyzed natural variation of splicing patterns in the transcriptomes of 81 natural strains of Drosophila melanogaster with known genotypes. We identified dozens of genotype-specific splicing patterns associated with putative cis-splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTL). The majority of changes can be explained by mutations in splice sites. Allelic-imbalance in splicing patterns confirmed that the majority are regulated mainly by cis-genetic effects. Remarkably, allele-specific splicing changes often lead to qualitative changes in gene models, yielding many isoforms not previously annotated. The observed alterations are typically outside protein-coding regions or affect only very short protein segments.

Although cell surface cues play a major role in this process, few dendrite specific signals have been identified to date. We conducted an in vivo RNAi screen in Drosophila class IV dendritic arborization (C4da) neurons and identified the conserved Ret receptor, known to play a role in axon guidance, as an important regulator of dendrite development. The loss of Ret results in severe dendrite defects due to loss of extracellular matrix adhesion, thus impairing growth within a 2D plane. We provide evidence that Ret interacts with integrins to regulate dendrite adhesion via rac1. In addition, Ret is required for dendrite stability and normal F-actin distribution suggesting it has an essential role in dendrite maintenance.

However, very little is understood mechanistically about the opposing process, homeostatic depression, and how bi-directional plasticity is achieved. Here, we show that homeostatic potentiation and depression can be simultaneously induced, demonstrating true bi-directional plasticity. Next, we show that mutations that block homeostatic potentiation do not alter homeostatic depression, demonstrating that these are genetically separable processes. Finally, we show that homeostatic depression is achieved by decreased presynaptic calcium channel abundance and calcium influx, changes that are independent of the presynaptic action potential waveform. Thus, we identify a novel mechanism of homeostatic synaptic plasticity and propose a model that can account for the observed bi-directional, homeostatic control of presynaptic neurotransmitter release.",2015,"Michael A GaviÃ±o, Kevin J Ford, Santiago Archila, Graeme W Davis, Michael A GaviÃ±o, Kevin J Ford, Santiago Archila, Graeme W Davis"

To investigate the possibility that mTORC1 can regulate muscle in vivo we ablated the essential dTORC1 subunit Raptor in Drosophila melanogaster and found that muscle-specific knockdown of Raptor causes flies to be too weak to emerge from their pupal cases during eclosion. Using a series of GAL4 drivers we also show that muscle-specific Raptor knockdown also causes shortened lifespan, even when eclosure is unaffected.

The oxidative damage induced by PH3 is considered to be one of the primary mechanisms of its toxicity in pest insects; however, the precise mode of PH3 action in this process is still unclear. In this study, we evaluated the responses of several oxidative biomarkers and two of the main antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), after fumigation treatment with PH3 in Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. The results showed that larvae exposed to sub-lethal levels of PH3 (0.028 mg/L) exhibited lower aerobic respiration rates and higher levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and lipid peroxidation (LPO). Furthermore, unlike SOD, the activity and expression of CAT and its encoding gene were downregulated by PH3 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Finally, the responses of six potential transcription factors of PH3 were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction to explore the regulation mechanism of DmCAT by PH3. There were no significant effects of PH3 on three nuclear factor-kappa B homologs (DORSAL, DIF, and RELISH) or two activator protein-1 genes (JUN and FOS), while dramatic inhibition of DNA replication-related element factor (DREF) expression was observed after fumigation with PH3, suggesting that PH3 could inhibit the expression of DmCAT via the DRE/DREF system. These results confirmed that PH3 induces oxidative stress and targets CAT by downregulating its encoding gene in Drosophila.

Drosophila Hook-Related Protein (Girdin) Is Essential for Sensory Dendrite Formation,26058848,10.1534/genetics.115.178954,"The dendrite of the sensory neuron is surrounded by support cells and is composed of two specialized compartments: the inner segment and the sensory cilium.

Hook-related proteins (HkRP) like Girdin, DAPLE, and Gipie are actin-binding proteins, implicated in actin organization and in cell motility. Here, we show that the Drosophila melanogaster single member of the Hook-related protein family, Girdin, is essential for sensory dendrite formation and function. Mutations in girdin were identified during a screen for fly mutants with no mechanosensory function. Physiological, morphological, and ultrastructural studies of girdin mutant flies indicate that the mechanosensory neurons innervating external sensory organs (bristles) initially form a ciliated dendrite that degenerates shortly after, followed by the clustering of their cell bodies. Importantly, we observed that Girdin is expressed transiently during dendrite morphogenesis in three previously unidentified actin-based structures surrounding the inner segment tip and the sensory cilium. These actin structures are largely missing in girdin mutant. Defects in cilia are observed in other sensory organs such as those mediating olfaction and taste, suggesting that Girdin has a general role in forming sensory dendrites in Drosophila. These suggest that Girdin functions temporarily within the sensory organ and that this function is essential for the formation of the sensory dendrites via actin structures.",2015,"Andrew Ha, Andrey Polyanovsky, Tomer Avidor-Reiss, Andrew Ha, Andrey Polyanovsky, Tomer Avidor-Reiss"

Prominent among these were PAK-interacting exchange factor (known as Pix or RtGEF) and G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein (Git). Pix is a conserved Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Rho-GEF) homologous to Beta-PIX and Alpha-PIX in mammals. Git is the single Drosophila melanogaster homolog of the mammalian GIT1 and GIT2 proteins, which were originally identified in the search for molecules that interact with G-protein-coupled receptor kinases. Pix and Git form an oligomeric scaffold to facilitate sterile 20-like kinase activation and have also been linked to GTPase regulation. We show that Pix and Git regulate Hippo-pathway-dependent tissue growth in D. melanogaster and that they do this in parallel to the known upstream regulator Fat cadherin. Pix and Git influence activity of the Hpo kinase by acting as a scaffold complex, rather than enzymes, and promote Hpo dimerization and autophosphorylation of Hpo's activation loop. Therefore, we provide important new insights into an ancient signaling network that controls the growth of metazoan tissues.",2015,"Lucas G Dent, Carole L C Poon, Xiaomeng Zhang, Joffrey L Degoutin, Marla Tipping, Alexey Veraksa, Kieran F Harvey, Lucas G Dent, Carole L C Poon, Xiaomeng Zhang, Joffrey L Degoutin, Marla Tipping, Alexey Veraksa, Kieran F Harvey"
Enhanced neurite outgrowth and branching precede increased amyloid-Î²-induced neuronal apoptosis in a novel Alzheimer's disease model,25125474,10.3233/JAD-140009,"Though it is widely accepted that amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) is a key factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. In order to study the association between AÎ² and neural circuitry dysfunction, we developed a primary culture preparation derived from the nervous system of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster larvae expressing human AÎ²1-42 (AÎ²42). Cultured neurons undergo a consistent developmental process, culminating in an elaborate neuronal network with distinct functional and morphological characteristics. Throughout this development, a time-dependent increase in intracellular expression levels of AÎ²42 was detected, followed by extracellular staining at a later time point. When compared to controls, AÎ²42 cultures exhibited enhanced levels of apoptosis, resulting in reduced cell viability. Moreover, as primary culture preparations enable high resolution monitoring of neuronal phenotypes, we were able to detect subtle morphological changes in neurons expressing AÎ²42, namely an enhancement in neurite outgrowth and arborization, which preceded the effect of neurodegeneration. Our results establish D. melanogaster primary neuronal cultures as a rapid, accessible and cost-effective platform for AD molecular studies and drug screening, and suggest a possible role for AÎ²42 in the organization of neuronal processes.",2015,"Yaara Saad, Daniel Segal, Amir Ayali, Yaara Saad, Daniel Segal, Amir Ayali"

Effects of a mixture of volatile organic compounds on total DNA and gene expression of heat shock proteins in Drosophila melanogaster,25352441,10.1007/s00244-014-0089-4,"The genotoxic effects of a mixture of 13 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on total DNA profiles and the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) HSP26, HSP60, HSP70, and HSP83 in fruit fly tissues were examined. Drosophila melanogaster Oregon R(+), reared under controlled conditions on artificial diets, was treated with 13 VOCs commonly found in water at concentrations of 10, 20, 50, and 75 ppb for 1 and 5 days. Band changes were clearly detected in random amplified polymorphic DNA assay, especially at the 50- and 75-ppb exposure levels, for both treatment periods. In addition, there were clear differences in the band profiles of the treated and untreated flies with changes in the band intensity and the loss/appearance of bands. Although the genomic template stability (GTS) exhibited irregular changes at the first day, significant decreases in GTS were observed after 5 days of VOC application. The lowest GTS value (27.77 Â± 1.96 %) was detected at the 75-ppb level after 5 days of the treatment. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed a significant increase in the relative expression of HSP26 and HSP60 after 1 and 5 days of the treatment, respectively. The expression of HSP70 increased significantly at all treatment concentrations and times. However, the greatest increase in expression level of HSP70 (4.2-fold) occurred at 20 ppb after 5 days of the treatment. HSP83 was the least affected by exposure to the VOCs. We conclude that trace levels of a mixture of VOCs can exert genotoxic effects on both total DNA and HSP levels in Drosophila.",2015,"Oguzhan Doganlar, Zeynep Banu Doganlar, Oguzhan Doganlar, Zeynep Banu Doganlar"
Dissecting neural pathways for forgetting in Drosophila olfactory aversive memory,26627257,10.1073/pnas.1512792112,"Recent studies have identified molecular pathways driving forgetting and supported the notion that forgetting is a biologically active process. The circuit mechanisms of forgetting, however, remain largely unknown. Here we report two sets of Drosophila neurons that account for the rapid forgetting of early olfactory aversive memory. We show that inactivating these neurons inhibits memory decay without altering learning, whereas activating them promotes forgetting. These neurons, including a cluster of dopaminergic neurons (PAM-Î²'1) and a pair of glutamatergic neurons (MBON-Î³4>Î³1Î³2), terminate in distinct subdomains in the mushroom body and represent parallel neural pathways for regulating forgetting. Interestingly, although activity of these neurons is required for memory decay over time, they are not required for acute forgetting during reversal learning. Our results thus not only establish the presence of multiple neural pathways for forgetting in Drosophila but also suggest the existence of diverse circuit mechanisms of forgetting in different contexts.",2015,"Yichun Shuai, Areekul Hirokawa, Yulian Ai, Min Zhang, Wanhe Li, Yi Zhong, Yichun Shuai, Areekul Hirokawa, Yulian Ai, Min Zhang, Wanhe Li, Yi Zhong"
Strong Costs and Benefits of Winter Acclimatization in Drosophila melanogaster,26075607,10.1371/journal.pone.0130307,"Studies on thermal acclimation in insects are often performed on animals acclimated in the laboratory under conditions that are not ecologically relevant. Costs and benefits of acclimation responses under such conditions may not reflect costs and benefits in natural populations subjected to daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations. Here we estimated costs and benefits in thermal tolerance limits in relation to winter acclimatization of Drosophila melanogaster. We sampled flies from a natural habitat during winter in Denmark (field flies) and compared heat and cold tolerance of these to that of flies collected from the same natural population, but acclimated to 25 Â°C or 13 Â°C in the laboratory (laboratory flies). We further obtained thermal performance curves for egg-to-adult viability of field and laboratory (25 Â°C) flies, to estimate possible cross-generational effects of acclimation. We found much higher cold tolerance and a lowered heat tolerance in field flies compared to laboratory flies reared at 25 Â°C. Flies reared in the laboratory at 13 Â°C exhibited the same thermal cost-benefit relations as the winter acclimatized flies. We also found a cost of winter acclimatization in terms of decreased egg-to-adult viability at high temperatures of eggs laid by winter acclimatized flies. Based on our findings we suggest that winter acclimatization in nature can induce strong benefits in terms of increased cold tolerance. These benefits can be reproduced in the laboratory under ecologically relevant rearing and testing conditions, and should be incorporated in species distribution modelling. Winter acclimatization also leads to decreased heat tolerance. This may create a mismatch between acclimation responses and the thermal environment, e.g. if temperatures suddenly increase during spring, under current and expected more variable future climatic conditions.",2015,"Mads Fristrup Schou, Volker Loeschcke, Torsten Nygaard Kristensen, Mads Fristrup Schou, Volker Loeschcke, Torsten Nygaard Kristensen"
Cortical microtubule nucleation can organise the cytoskeleton of Drosophila oocytes to define the anteroposterior axis,26406117,10.7554/eLife.06088,"Many cells contain non-centrosomal arrays of microtubules (MTs), but the assembly, organisation and function of these arrays are poorly understood. We present the first theoretical model for the non-centrosomal MT cytoskeleton in Drosophila oocytes, in which bicoid and oskar mRNAs become localised to establish the anterior-posterior body axis. Constrained by experimental measurements, the model shows that a simple gradient of cortical MT nucleation is sufficient to reproduce the observed MT distribution, cytoplasmic flow patterns and localisation of oskar and naive bicoid mRNAs. Our simulations exclude a major role for cytoplasmic flows in localisation and reveal an organisation of the MT cytoskeleton that is more ordered than previously thought. Furthermore, modulating cortical MT nucleation induces a bifurcation in cytoskeletal organisation that accounts for the phenotypes of polarity mutants. Thus, our three-dimensional model explains many features of the MT network and highlights the importance of differential cortical MT nucleation for axis formation.",2015,"Philipp Khuc Trong, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Doerflinger, JÃ¶rn Dunkel, Daniel St Johnston, Raymond E Goldstein, Philipp Khuc Trong, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Doerflinger, JÃ¶rn Dunkel, Daniel St Johnston, Raymond E Goldstein"
Phospholipase D activity couples plasma membrane endocytosis with retromer dependent recycling,27848911,10.7554/eLife.18515,"During illumination, the light-sensitive plasma membrane (rhabdomere) of Drosophila photoreceptors undergoes turnover with consequent changes in size and composition. However, the mechanism by which illumination is coupled to rhabdomere turnover remains unclear. We find that photoreceptors contain a light-dependent phospholipase D (PLD) activity. During illumination, loss of PLD resulted in an enhanced reduction in rhabdomere size, accumulation of Rab7 positive, rhodopsin1-containing vesicles (RLVs) in the cell body and reduced rhodopsin protein. These phenotypes were associated with reduced levels of phosphatidic acid, the product of PLD activity and were rescued by reconstitution with catalytically active PLD. In wild-type photoreceptors, during illumination, enhanced PLD activity was sufficient to clear RLVs from the cell body by a process dependent on Arf1-GTP levels and retromer complex function. Thus, during illumination, PLD activity couples endocytosis of RLVs with their recycling to the plasma membrane thus maintaining plasma membrane size and composition.",2016,"Rajan Thakur, Aniruddha Panda, Elise Coessens, Nikita Raj, Shweta Yadav, Sruthi Balakrishnan, Qifeng Zhang, Plamen Georgiev, Bishal Basak, Renu Pasricha, Michael Jo Wakelam, Nicholas T Ktistakis, Padinjat Raghu, Rajan Thakur, Aniruddha Panda, Elise Coessens, Nikita Raj, Shweta Yadav, Sruthi Balakrishnan, Qifeng Zhang, Plamen Georgiev, Bishal Basak, Renu Pasricha, Michael Jo Wakelam, Nicholas T Ktistakis, Padinjat Raghu"

We have used formation of the Drosophila indirect flight musculature for studying the assembly and maturation of thin-filament arrays in a skeletal muscle model system. Employing GFP-tagged actin monomer incorporation, we identify several distinct phases in the dynamic construction of thin-filament arrays. This sequence includes assembly of nascent arrays after an initial period of intensive microfilament synthesis, followed by array elongation, primarily from filament pointed-ends, radial growth of the arrays via recruitment of peripheral filaments and continuous barbed-end turnover. Using genetic approaches we have identified Fhos, the single Drosophila homolog of the FHOD sub-family of formins, as a primary and versatile mediator of IFM thin-filament organization. Localization of Fhos to the barbed-ends of the arrays, achieved via a novel N-terminal domain, appears to be a critical aspect of its sarcomeric roles.",2016,"Arkadi Shwartz, Nagaraju Dhanyasi, Eyal D Schejter, Ben-Zion Shilo, Arkadi Shwartz, Nagaraju Dhanyasi, Eyal D Schejter, Ben-Zion Shilo"
Expression of polyQ aggregates in Malpighian tubules leads to degeneration in Drosophila melanogaster,26517966,10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.10.028,"Background:
      
    

    
      Polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders are caused by expanded CAG (Glutamine) repeats in neurons in the brain. The expanded repeats are also expressed in the non-neuronal cells, however, their contribution to disease pathogenesis is not very well studied. In the present study, we have expressed a stretch of 127 Glutamine repeats in Malpighian tubules (MTs) of Drosophila melanogaster as these tissues do not undergo ecdysone induced histolysis during larval to pupal transition at metamorphosis.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Progressive degeneration, which is the hallmark of neurodegeneration is also observed in MTs. The mutant protein forms inclusion bodies in the nucleus resulting in expansion of the nucleus and affect chromatin organization which appear loose and open, eventually resulting in DNA fragmentation and blebbing. A virtual absence of tubule lumen was observed followed by functional abnormalities. As development progressed, severe abnormalities affecting pupal epithelial morphogenesis processes were observed resulting in complete lethality. Distribution of heterogeneous RNA binding protein (hnRNP), HRB87F, Wnt/wingless and JNK signaling and expression of Relish was also found to be affected. Expression of resistance genes following polyQ expression was up regulated.

A Novel Strategy for Live Detection of Viral Infection in Drosophila melanogaster,27189868,10.1038/srep26250,"We have created a transgenic reporter for virus infection, and used it to study Nora virus infection in Drosophila melanogaster. The transgenic construct, Munin, expresses the yeast transcription factor Gal4, tethered to a transmembrane anchor via a linker that can be cleaved by a viral protease. In infected cells, liberated Gal4 will then transcribe any gene that is linked to a promoter with a UAS motif, the target for Gal4 transcription. For instance, infected cells will glow red in the offspring of a cross between the Munin stock and flies with a UAS-RFP(nls) transgene (expressing a red fluorescent protein). In such flies we show that after natural infection, via the faecal-oral route, 5-15% of the midgut cells are infected, but there is little if any infection elsewhere. By contrast, we can detect infection in many other tissues after injection of virus into the body cavity. The same principle could be applied for other viruses and it could also be used to express or suppress any gene of interest in infected cells.",2016,"Jens-Ola EkstrÃ¶m, Dan Hultmark, Jens-Ola EkstrÃ¶m, Dan Hultmark"
Sulfate and thiosulfate inhibit oxalate transport via a dPrestin (Slc26a6)-dependent mechanism in an insect model of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis,26538444,10.1152/ajprenal.00406.2015,"Nephrolithiasis is one of the most common urinary tract disorders, with the majority of kidney stones composed of calcium oxalate (CaOx). Given its prevalence (US occurrence 10%), it is still poorly understood, lacking progress in identifying new therapies because of its complex etiology. Drosophila melanogaster (fruitfly) is a recently developed model of CaOx nephrolithiasis. Effects of sulfate and thiosulfate on crystal formation were investigated using the Drosophila model, as well as electrophysiological effects on both Drosophila (Slc26a5/6; dPrestin) and mouse (mSlc26a6) oxalate transporters utilizing the Xenopus laevis oocyte heterologous expression system. Results indicate that both transport thiosulfate with a much higher affinity than sulfate Additionally, both compounds were effective at decreasing CaOx crystallization when added to the diet. However, these results were not observed when compounds were applied to Malpighian tubules ex vivo. Neither compound affected CaOx crystallization in dPrestin knockdown animals, indicating a role for principal cell-specific dPrestin in luminal oxalate transport. Furthermore, thiosulfate has a higher affinity for dPrestin and mSlc26a6 compared with oxalate These data indicate that thiosulfate's ability to act as a competitive inhibitor of oxalate via dPrestin, can explain the decrease in CaOx crystallization seen in the presence of thiosulfate, but not sulfate. Overall, our findings predict that thiosulfate or oxalate-mimics may be effective as therapeutic competitive inhibitors of CaOx crystallization.",2016,"Greg M Landry, Taku Hirata, Jacob B Anderson, Pablo Cabrero, Christopher J R Gallo, Julian A T Dow, Michael F Romero, Greg M Landry, Taku Hirata, Jacob B Anderson, Pablo Cabrero, Christopher J R Gallo, Julian A T Dow, Michael F Romero"
Homology directed repair is unaffected by the absence of siRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster,27353331,10.1093/nar/gkw570,"Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) defend the organism against harmful transcripts from exogenous (e.g. viral) or endogenous (e.g. transposons) sources. Recent publications describe the production of siRNAs induced by DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in Neurospora crassa, Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster and human cells, which suggests a conserved function. A current hypothesis is that break-induced small RNAs ensure efficient homologous recombination (HR). However, biogenesis of siRNAs is often intertwined with other small RNA species, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), which complicates interpretation of experimental results. In Drosophila, siRNAs are produced by Dcr-2 while miRNAs are processed by Dcr-1. Thus, it is possible to probe siRNA function without miRNA deregulation. We therefore examined DNA double-strand break repair after perturbation of siRNA biogenesis in cultured Drosophila cells as well as mutant flies. Our assays comprised reporters for the single-strand annealing pathway, homologous recombination and sensitivity to the DSB-inducing drug camptothecin. We could not detect any repair defects caused by the lack of siRNAs derived from the broken DNA locus. Since production of these siRNAs depends on local transcription, they may thus participate in RNA metabolism-an established function of siRNAs-rather than DNA repair.",2016,"Ines Schmidts, Romy BÃ¶ttcher, Milijana Mirkovic-HÃ¶sle, Klaus FÃ¶rstemann, Ines Schmidts, Romy BÃ¶ttcher, Milijana Mirkovic-HÃ¶sle, Klaus FÃ¶rstemann"

Life span extension by targeting a link between metabolism and histone acetylation in Drosophila,26781291,10.15252/embr.201541132,"Old age is associated with a progressive decline of mitochondrial function and changes in nuclear chromatin. However, little is known about how metabolic activity and epigenetic modifications change as organisms reach their midlife. Here, we assessed how cellular metabolism and protein acetylation change during early aging in Drosophila melanogaster. Contrary to common assumptions, we find that flies increase oxygen consumption and become less sensitive to histone deacetylase inhibitors as they reach midlife. Further, midlife flies show changes in the metabolome, elevated acetyl-CoA levels, alterations in protein-notably histone-acetylation, as well as associated transcriptome changes. Based on these observations, we decreased the activity of the acetyl-CoA-synthesizing enzyme ATP citrate lyase (ATPCL) or the levels of the histone H4 K12-specific acetyltransferase Chameau.

Tissue communication in a systemic immune response of Drosophila,27116253,10.1080/19336934.2016.1182269,"Several signaling pathways, including the JAK/STAT and Toll pathways, are known to activate blood cells (hemocytes) in Drosophila melanogaster larvae. They are believed to regulate the immune response against infections by parasitoid wasps, such as Leptopilina boulardi, but how these pathways control the hemocytes is not well understood. Here, we discuss the recent discovery that both muscles and fat body take an active part in this response. Parasitoid wasp infection induces Upd2 and Upd3 secretion from hemocytes, leading to JAK/STAT activation mainly in hemocytes and in skeletal muscles. JAK/STAT activation in muscles, but not in hemocytes, is required for an efficient encapsulation of wasp eggs. This suggests that Upd2 and Upd3 are important cytokines, coordinating different tissues for the cellular immune response in Drosophila. In the fat body, Toll signaling initiates a systemic response in which hemocytes are mobilized and activated hemocytes (lamellocytes) are generated. However, the contribution of Toll signaling to the defense against wasps is limited, probably because the wasps inject inhibitors that prevent the activation of the Toll pathway. In conclusion, parasite infection induces a systemic response in Drosophila larvae involving major organ systems and probably the physiology of the entire organism.",2016,"Hairu Yang, Dan Hultmark, Hairu Yang, Dan Hultmark"

Rapid progress in gerontology research has revealed that aging can be slowed through mild stress-induced hormesis. We previously reported that hyperbaric normoxia (HN, 2 atm absolute pressure with 10% O2) induces a cytoprotective response in vitro by regulating fibronectin. In the present study, we investigated the hormetic effects of prenatal HN exposure on Drosophila healthspan related to molecular defense mechanisms. HN exposure had no disruptive effect on developmental rate or adult body weight. However, lifespan was clearly enhanced, as was resistance to oxidative and heat stress. In addition, levels of reactive oxygen species were significantly decreased and motor performance was increased. HN stress has been shown to trigger molecular changes in the heat shock response and ROS scavenging system, including hsp70, catalase, glutathione synthase, and MnSOD. Furthermore, to determine the hormetic mechanism underlying these phenotypic and molecular changes, we performed a genome-wide profiling in HN-exposed and control flies. Genes encoding chitin metabolism were highly up-regulated, which could possibly serve to scavenge free radicals.

Integrating RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data to characterize long non-coding RNAs in Drosophila melanogaster,26969372,10.1186/s12864-016-2457-0,"Background:
      
    

    
      Recent advances in sequencing technology have opened a new era in RNA studies. Novel types of RNAs such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been discovered by transcriptomic sequencing and some lncRNAs have been found to play essential roles in biological processes. However, only limited information is available for lncRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster, an important model organism. Therefore, the characterization of lncRNAs and identification of new lncRNAs in D. melanogaster is an important area of research. Moreover, there is an increasing interest in the use of ChIP-seq data (H3K4me3, H3K36me3 and Pol II) to detect signatures of active transcription for reported lncRNAs.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We have developed a computational approach to identify new lncRNAs from two tissue-specific RNA-seq datasets using the poly(A)-enriched and the ribo-zero method, respectively. In our results, we identified 462 novel lncRNA transcripts, which we combined with 4137 previously published lncRNA transcripts into a curated dataset. We then utilized 61 RNA-seq and 32 ChIP-seq datasets to improve the annotation of the curated lncRNAs with regards to transcriptional direction, exon regions, classification, expression in the brain, possession of a poly(A) tail, and presence of conventional chromatin signatures. Furthermore, we used 30 time-course RNA-seq datasets and 32 ChIP-seq datasets to investigate whether the lncRNAs reported by RNA-seq have active transcription signatures. The results showed that more than half of the reported lncRNAs did not have chromatin signatures related to active transcription. To clarify this issue, we conducted RT-qPCR experiments and found that ~95.24% of the selected lncRNAs were truly transcribed, regardless of whether they were associated with active chromatin signatures or not.

To address this issue, we sequenced the miRNA complement of the hemimetabolan Blattella germanica and reannotated that of two other hemimetabolan species, Locusta migratoria and Acyrthosiphon pisum, and of four holometabolan species, Apis mellifera, Tribolium castaneum, Bombyx mori and Drosophila melanogaster. Our analyses show that the variation of insect miRNAs is an artefact mainly resulting from poor sampling and inaccurate miRNA annotation, and that insects share a conserved microRNA toolkit of 65 families exhibiting very low variation. For example, the evolutionary shift toward a complete metamorphosis was accompanied only by the acquisition of three and the loss of one miRNA families.",2016,"Guillem Ylla, Bastian Fromm, Maria-Dolors Piulachs, Xavier Belles, Guillem Ylla, Bastian Fromm, Maria-Dolors Piulachs, Xavier Belles"
Neuronal cell fate diversification controlled by sub-temporal action of Kruppel,27740908,10.7554/eLife.19311,"During Drosophila embryonic nervous system development, neuroblasts express a programmed cascade of five temporal transcription factors that govern the identity of cells generated at different time-points.

The sub-temporal program acts both upon itself and upon the determination cascades to diversify the castor window. Surprisingly, the early temporal gene Kruppel acts as one of the sub-temporal genes within the late castor window.

A recent study demonstrated that this poorly understood complex nutrition drives strikingly similar phenotypic effects in Drosophila melanogaster, such as increased body size and reduced developmental time, making possible the use of D. melanogaster as a model system for the genetic analysis of the cellular mechanisms underlying RJ and caste differentiation. We demonstrate here that RJ increases the body size of some wild-type strains of D. melanogaster but not others, and report significant delays in developmental time in all flies reared on RJ. These findings suggest that cryptic genetic variation may be a factor in the D. melanogaster response to RJ, and should be considered when attempting to elucidate response mechanisms to environmental changes in non-honeybee species.",2016,"Stefanie L Morgan, Joseph A Seggio, Nara F Nascimento, Dana D Huh, Jasmin A Hicks, Katherine A Sharp, Jeffrey D Axelrod, Kevin C Wang"
Tau and spectraplakins promote synapse formation and maintenance through Jun kinase and neuronal trafficking,27501441,10.7554/eLife.14694,"The mechanisms regulating synapse numbers during development and ageing are essential for normal brain function and closely linked to brain disorders including dementias. Using Drosophila, we demonstrate roles of the microtubule-associated protein Tau in regulating synapse numbers, thus unravelling an important cellular requirement of normal Tau. In this context, we find that Tau displays a strong functional overlap with microtubule-binding spectraplakins, establishing new links between two different neurodegenerative factors. Tau and the spectraplakin Short Stop act upstream of a three-step regulatory cascade ensuring adequate delivery of synaptic proteins. This cascade involves microtubule stability as the initial trigger, JNK signalling as the central mediator, and kinesin-3 mediated axonal transport as the key effector. This cascade acts during development (synapse formation) and ageing (synapse maintenance) alike. Therefore, our findings suggest novel explanations for intellectual disability in Tau deficient individuals, as well as early synapse loss in dementias including Alzheimer's disease.",2016,"Andre Voelzmann, Pilar Okenve-Ramos, Yue Qu, Monika Chojnowska-Monga, Manuela Del CaÃ±o-Espinel, Andreas Prokop, Natalia Sanchez-Soriano, Andre Voelzmann, Pilar Okenve-Ramos, Yue Qu, Monika Chojnowska-Monga, Manuela Del CaÃ±o-Espinel, Andreas Prokop, Natalia Sanchez-Soriano"

Internal states drive nutrient homeostasis by modulating exploration-exploitation trade-off,27770569,10.7554/eLife.19920,"Internal states can profoundly alter the behavior of animals. A quantitative understanding of the behavioral changes upon metabolic challenges is key to a mechanistic dissection of how animals maintain nutritional homeostasis. We used an automated video tracking setup to characterize how amino acid and reproductive states interact to shape exploitation and exploration decisions taken by adult Drosophila melanogaster. We find that these two states have specific effects on the decisions to stop at and leave proteinaceous food patches. Furthermore, the internal nutrient state defines the exploration-exploitation trade-off: nutrient-deprived flies focus on specific patches while satiated flies explore more globally. Finally, we show that olfaction mediates the efficient recognition of yeast as an appropriate protein source in mated females and that octopamine is specifically required to mediate homeostatic postmating responses without affecting internal nutrient sensing. Internal states therefore modulate specific aspects of exploitation and exploration to change nutrient selection.",2016,"VerÃ³nica MarÃ­a Corrales-Carvajal, Aldo A Faisal, Carlos Ribeiro, VerÃ³nica MarÃ­a Corrales-Carvajal, Aldo A Faisal, Carlos Ribeiro"
A mechanism for sickness sleep: lessons from invertebrates,28028818,10.1113/JP273009,"During health, animal sleep is regulated by an internal clock and by the duration of prior wakefulness. During sickness, sleep is regulated by cytokines released from either peripheral cells or from cells within the nervous system. These cytokines regulate central nervous system neurons to induce sleep. Recent research in the invertebrates Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster has led to new insights into the mechanism of sleep during sickness. Sickness is triggered by exposure to environments such as infection, heat, or ultraviolet light irradiation, all of which cause cellular stress. Epidermal growth factor is released from stressed cells and signals to activate central neuroendocrine cell(s). These neuron(s) release neuropeptides including those containing an amidated arginine(R)-phenylalanine(F) motif at their C-termini (RFamide peptides). Importantly, mechanisms regulating sickness sleep are partially distinct from those regulating healthy sleep. We will here review key findings that have elucidated the central neuroendocrine mechanism of sleep during sickness. Adaptive mechanisms employed in the control of sickness sleep may play a role in correcting cellular homeostasis after various insults. We speculate that these mechanisms may play a maladaptive role in human pathological conditions such as in the fatigue and anorexia associated with autoimmune diseases, with major depression, and with unexplained chronic fatigue.",2017,"Kristen C Davis, David M Raizen, Kristen C Davis, David M Raizen"
A map of sensilla and neurons in the taste system of drosophila larvae,28842919,10.1002/cne.24308,"In Drosophila melanogaster larvae, the prime site of external taste reception is the terminal organ (TO). Though investigation on the TO's implications in taste perception has been expanding rapidly, the sensilla of the TO have been essentially unexplored. In this study, we performed a systematic anatomical and molecular analysis of the TO. We precisely define morphological types of TO sensilla taking advantage of volume electron microscopy and 3D image analysis. We corroborate the presence of five external types of sensilla: papilla, pit, spot, knob, and modified papilla. Detailed 3D analysis of their structural organization allowed a finer discrimination into subtypes. We classify three subtypes of papilla and pit sensilla, respectively, and two subtypes of knob sensilla. Further, we determine the repertoire of receptor genes for each sensillum by analyzing GAL4 driver lines of Ir, Gr, Ppk, and Trp receptor genes. We construct a map of the TO, in which the receptor genes are mapped to neurons of individual sensilla. While modified papillum and spot sensilla are not labeled by any GAL4 driver, neurons of the pit, papilla, and knob type are labeled by partially overlapping but different subsets of GAL4 driver lines of the Ir, Gr, and Ppk gene family. The results suggest that pit, papilla and knob sensilla act in contact chemosensation. However, they likely do these employing different stimulus transduction mechanisms to sense the diverse chemicals of their environment.",2017,"Anna Rist, Andreas S Thum, Anna Rist, Andreas S Thum"
Life History Traits of an Extended Longevity Phenotype of Drosophila melanogaster,28183243,10.2174/1874609810666170209111350,"Background:
      
    

    
      Aging or senescence is a complex biological phenomenon. Artificially selected Drosophila for extended longevity is one of the experimental models used to understand the mechanisms involved in aging and to test various theories.
    

    
  


        Objective:
      
    

    
      To examine the life history traits and biochemical defenses in relation to aging in an extended longevity phenotype of Drosophila melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Life history traits viz., survivability, fecundity, development time, dry weight, wing size, lipid content, starvation, desiccation and cold resistances, locomotory ability, antioxidant enzyme activities and reactive oxygen species level between control and selected lines of D. melanogaster were investigated.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In our model of Drosophila, extended longevity is associated with no trade-off in fecundity and shows variable resistance to environmental stress such as starvation, cold and desiccation. Enhanced biochemical defense involving the antioxidant enzymes was positively correlated with longevity.

Expression patterns of cardiac aging in Drosophila,28090760,10.1111/acel.12559,"Aging causes cardiac dysfunction, often leading to heart failure and death. The molecular basis of age-associated changes in cardiac structure and function is largely unknown. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is well-suited to investigate the genetics of cardiac aging. Flies age rapidly over the course of weeks, benefit from many tools to easily manipulate their genome, and their heart has significant genetic and phenotypic similarities to the human heart. Here, we performed a cardiac-specific gene expression study on aging Drosophila and carried out a comparative meta-analysis with published rodent data. Pathway level transcriptome comparisons suggest that age-related, extra-cellular matrix remodeling and alterations in mitochondrial metabolism, protein handling, and contractile functions are conserved between Drosophila and rodent hearts. However, expression of only a few individual genes similarly changed over time between and even within species. We also examined gene expression in single fly hearts and found significant variability as has been reported in rodents. We propose that individuals may arrive at similar cardiac aging phenotypes via dissimilar transcriptional changes, including those in transcription factors and micro-RNAs.

Moving Speciation Genetics Forward: Modern Techniques Build on Foundational Studies in Drosophila,29097397,10.1534/genetics.116.187120,"The question of how new species evolve has been examined at every level, from macroevolutionary patterns of diversification to molecular population genetic analyses of specific genomic regions between species pairs. Drosophila has been at the center of many of these research efforts. Though our understanding of the speciation process has grown considerably over the past few decades, very few genes have been identified that contribute to barriers to reproduction. The development of advanced molecular genetic and genomic methods provides promising avenues for the rapid discovery of more genes that contribute to speciation, particularly those involving prezygotic isolation. The continued expansion of tools and resources, especially for species other than Drosophila melanogaster, will be most effective when coupled with comparative approaches that reveal the genetic basis of reproductive isolation across a range of divergence times. Future research programs in Drosophila have high potential to answer long-standing questions in speciation. These include identifying the selective forces that contribute to divergence between populations and the genetic basis of traits that cause reproductive isolation. The latter can be expanded upon to understand how the genetic basis of reproductive isolation changes over time and whether certain pathways and genes are more commonly involved.",2017,"Dean M Castillo, Daniel A Barbash, Dean M Castillo, Daniel A Barbash"
Nutrient-Dependent Endocycling in Steroidogenic Tissue Dictates Timing of Metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster,28121986,10.1371/journal.pgen.1006583,"Many animals have an intrinsic growth checkpoint during juvenile development, after which an irreversible decision is made to upregulate steroidogenesis, triggering the metamorphic juvenile-to-adult transition. However, a molecular process underlying such a critical developmental decision remains obscure. Here we show that nutrient-dependent endocycling in steroidogenic cells provides the machinery necessary for irreversible activation of metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster. Endocycle progression in cells of the prothoracic gland (PG) is tightly coupled with the growth checkpoint, and block of endocycle in PG cells causes larval developmental arrest due to reduction in biosynthesis of the steroid hormone ecdysone. Moreover, inhibition of the nutrient sensor target of rapamycin (TOR) in the PG during the checkpoint period causes endocycle inhibition and developmental arrest, which can be rescued by inducing additional rounds of endocycles by Cyclin E. We propose that a TOR-mediated cell cycle checkpoint in steroidogenic tissue provides a systemic growth checkpoint for reproductive maturation.",2017,"Yuya Ohhara, Satoru Kobayashi, Naoki Yamanaka, Yuya Ohhara, Satoru Kobayashi, Naoki Yamanaka"

Mechanisms of sleep plasticity due to sexual experience in Drosophila melanogaster,28851647,10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.08.020,"Sleep can be altered by an organism's previous experience. For instance, female Drosophila melanogaster experience a post-mating reduction in daytime sleep that is purportedly mediated by sex peptide (SP), one of many seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) transferred from male to female during mating. In the present study, we first characterized this mating effect on sleep more fully, as it had previously only been tested in young flies under 12h light/12h dark conditions. We found that mating reduced sleep equivalently in 3-day-old or 14-day-old females, and could even occur in females who had been mated previously, suggesting that there is not a developmental critical period for the suppression of sleep by mating. In conditions of constant darkness, circadian rhythms were not affected by prior mating. In either constant darkness or constant light, the sleep reduction due to mating was no longer confined to the subjective day but could be observed throughout the 24-hour period. This suggests that the endogenous clock may dictate the timing of when the mating effect on sleep is expressed. We recently reported that genetic elimination of SP only partially blocked the post-mating female siesta sleep reduction, suggesting that the effect was unlikely to be governed solely by SP. We found here that the daytime sleep reduction was also reduced but not eliminated in females mated to mutant males lacking the vast majority of SFPs. This suggested that SFPs other than SP play a minimal role in the mating effect on sleep, and that additional non-SFP signals from the male might be involved. Males lacking sperm were able to induce a normal initial mating effect on female sleep, although the effect declined more rapidly in these females. This result indicated that neither the presence of sperm within the female reproductive tract nor female impregnation are required for the initial mating effect on sleep to occur, although sperm may serve to prolong the effect. Finally, we tested for contributions from other aspects of the mating experience. NorpA and eya2 mutants with disrupted vision showed normal mating effects on sleep. By separating males from females with a mesh, we found that visual and olfactory stimuli from male exposure, in the absence of physical contact, could not replicate the mating effect. Further, in ken/barbie male flies lacking external genitalia, courtship and physical contact without ejaculation were also unable to replicate the mating effect. These findings confirmed that the influence of mating on sleep does in fact require male/female contact including copulation, but may not be mediated exclusively by SP transfer.",2017,"Abigail E Dove, Brianne L Cook, Zhazira Irgebay, Christopher G Vecsey, Abigail E Dove, Brianne L Cook, Zhazira Irgebay, Christopher G Vecsey"
Variation in the Intensity of Selection on Codon Bias over Time Causes Contrasting Patterns of Base Composition Evolution in Drosophila,28082609,10.1093/gbe/evw291,"Four-fold degenerate coding sites form a major component of the genome, and are often used to make inferences about selection and demography, so that understanding their evolution is important. Despite previous efforts, many questions regarding the causes of base composition changes at these sites in Drosophila remain unanswered. To shed further light on this issue, we obtained a new whole-genome polymorphism data set from D. simulans. We analyzed samples from the putatively ancestral range of D. simulans, as well as an existing polymorphism data set from an African population of D. melanogaster. By using D. yakuba as an outgroup, we found clear evidence for selection on 4-fold sites along both lineages over a substantial period, with the intensity of selection increasing with GC content. Based on an explicit model of base composition evolution, we suggest that the observed AT-biased substitution pattern in both lineages is probably due to an ancestral reduction in selection intensity, and is unlikely to be the result of an increase in mutational bias towards AT alone. By using two polymorphism-based methods for estimating selection coefficients over different timescales, we show that the selection intensity on codon usage has been rather stable in D. simulans in the recent past, but the long-term estimates in D. melanogaster are much higher than the short-term ones, indicating a continuing decline in selection intensity, to such an extent that the short-term estimates suggest that selection is only active in the most GC-rich parts of the genome. Finally, we provide evidence for complex evolutionary patterns in the putatively neutral short introns, which cannot be explained by the standard GC-biased gene conversion model. These results reveal a dynamic picture of base composition evolution.",2017,"Benjamin C Jackson, JosÃ© L Campos, Penelope R Haddrill, Brian Charlesworth, Kai Zeng, Benjamin C Jackson, JosÃ© L Campos, Penelope R Haddrill, Brian Charlesworth, Kai Zeng"
Biological phosphorylation of an Unnatural Base Pair (UBP) using a Drosophila melanogaster deoxynucleoside kinase (DmdNK) mutant,28323896,10.1371/journal.pone.0174163,"One research goal for unnatural base pair (UBP) is to replicate, transcribe and translate them in vivo. Accordingly, the corresponding unnatural nucleoside triphosphates must be available at sufficient concentrations within the cell. To achieve this goal, the unnatural nucleoside analogues must be phosphorylated to the corresponding nucleoside triphosphates by a cascade of three kinases. The first step is the monophosphorylation of unnatural deoxynucleoside catalyzed by deoxynucleoside kinases (dNK), which is generally considered the rate limiting step because of the high specificity of dNKs. Here, we applied a Drosophila melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase (DmdNK) to the phosphorylation of an UBP (a pyrimidine analogue (6-amino-5-nitro-3-(1'-b-d-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl)-2(1H)-pyridone, Z) and its complementary purine analogue (2-amino-8-(1'-b-d-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl)-imidazo[1,2-a]-1,3,5-triazin-4(8H)-one, P). The results showed that DmdNK could efficiently phosphorylate only the dP nucleoside. To improve the catalytic efficiency, a DmdNK-Q81E mutant was created based on rational design and structural analyses. This mutant could efficiently phosphorylate both dZ and dP nucleoside. Structural modeling indicated that the increased efficiency of dZ phosphorylation by the DmdNK-Q81E mutant might be related to the three additional hydrogen bonds formed between E81 and the dZ base.

To reveal the logic of olfaction, it is fundamental to map odor representations from the glomerular channels into higher brain centers.

      We characterize odor response profiles of AL projection neurons (PNs) originating from 31 glomeruli using whole cell patch-clamp recordings in Drosophila melanogaster. We reveal that odor representation from olfactory sensory neurons to PNs is generally conserved, while transformation of odor tuning curves is glomerulus-dependent.

Increased food intake after starvation enhances sleep in Drosophila melanogaster,28645777,10.1016/j.jgg.2017.05.006,"Feeding and sleep are highly conserved, interconnected behaviors essential for survival. Starvation has been shown to potently suppress sleep across species; however, whether satiety promotes sleep is still unclear. Here we use the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model organism to address the interaction between feeding and sleep. We first monitored the sleep of flies that had been starved for 24 h and found that sleep amount increased in the first 4 h after flies were given food. Increased sleep after starvation was due to an increase in sleep bout number and average sleep bout length. Mutants of translin or adipokinetic hormone, which fail to suppress sleep during starvation, still exhibited a sleep increase after starvation, suggesting that sleep increase after starvation is not a consequence of sleep loss during starvation. We also found that feeding activity and food consumption were higher in the first 10-30 min after starvation. Restricting food consumption in starved flies to 30 min was sufficient to increase sleep for 1 h. Although flies ingested a comparable amount of food at differing sucrose concentrations, sleep increase after starvation on a lower sucrose concentration was undetectable. Taken together, our results suggest that increased food intake after starvation enhances sleep and reveals a novel relationship between feeding and sleep.",2017,"Josue M Regalado, McKenna B Cortez, Jeremy Grubbs, Jared A Link, Alexander van der Linden, Yong Zhang, Josue M Regalado, McKenna B Cortez, Jeremy Grubbs, Jared A Link, Alexander van der Linden, Yong Zhang"
Assessment of the carcinogenic potential of high intense-sweeteners through the test for detection of epithelial tumor clones (warts) in Drosophila melanogaster,28027980,10.1016/j.fct.2016.12.028,"High intensity-sweeteners (HIS) are natural or synthetic substances, sweeter than sugar, providing sweetness without calories. Sweeteners are mainly used as an aid in losing weight, preventing obesity and controlling blood sugar levels for diabetics. The objective of this study was to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of the sweeteners aspartame, sucralose, sodium saccharin and steviol glycoside, using the test for detection of epithelial tumor clones in Drosophila melanogaster. Larvae of 72 Â± 4h, obtained from wts/TM3 female mated with mwh/mwh males, were treated for approximately 48h with different concentrations of aspartame (0.85, 1.7, 3.4, 6.8 or 13.6 mM ); sucralose (0.5, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0 or 10 mM); sodium saccharin (25; 50; 100; 200 or 400 mM) and steviol glycoside (2.5; 5.0; 10; 20 or 40 mM). Water (Reverse Osmosis) and doxorubicin (DXR 0.4 mM) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed (p > 0.05) in tumor frequencies in individuals treated with all concentrations of these sweeteners when compared to negative control.

The sex of specific neurons controls female body growth in Drosophila,28976974,10.1371/journal.pbio.2002252,"Sexual dimorphisms in body size are widespread throughout the animal kingdom but their underlying mechanisms are not well characterized. Most models for how sex chromosome genes specify size dimorphism have emphasized the importance of gonadal hormones and cell-autonomous influences in mammals versus strictly cell-autonomous mechanisms in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we use tissue-specific genetics to investigate how sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is established in Drosophila. We find that the larger body size characteristic of Drosophila females is established very early in larval development via an increase in the growth rate per unit of body mass. We demonstrate that the female sex determination gene, Sex-lethal (Sxl), functions in central nervous system (CNS) neurons as part of a relay that specifies the early sex-specific growth trajectories of larval but not imaginal tissues. Neuronal Sxl acts additively in 2 neuronal subpopulations, one of which corresponds to 7 median neurosecretory cells: the insulin-producing cells (IPCs). Surprisingly, however, male-female differences in the production of insulin-like peptides (Ilps) from the IPCs do not appear to be involved in establishing SSD in early larvae, although they may play a later role. These findings support a relay model in which Sxl in neurons and Sxl in local tissues act together to specify the female-specific growth of the larval body. They also reveal that, even though the sex determination pathways in Drosophila and mammals are different, they both modulate body growth via a combination of tissue-autonomous and nonautonomous inputs.",2017,"Annick Sawala, Alex P Gould, Annick Sawala, Alex P Gould"
Sex-specific effects of social isolation on ageing in Drosophila melanogaster,28830760,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.08.008,"Social environments can have a major impact on ageing profiles in many animals. However, such patterns in variation in ageing and their underlying mechanisms are not well understood, particularly because both social contact and isolation can be stressful. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster fruitflies to examine sex-specific effects of social contact. We kept flies in isolation versus same-sex pairing throughout life, and measured actuarial (lifespan) and functional senescence (declines in climbing ability). To investigate underlying mechanisms, we determined whether an immune stress (wounding) interacted with effects of social contact, and assessed behaviours that could contribute to differences in ageing rates. Pairing reduced lifespan for both sexes, but the effect was greater for males. In contrast, pairing reduced the rate of decline in climbing ability for females, whereas for males, pairing caused more rapid declines with age. Wounding reduced lifespan for both sexes, but doubled the negative effect of pairing on male lifespan. We found no evidence that these effects are driven by behavioural interactions. These findings suggest that males and females are differentially sensitive to social contact, that environmental stressors can impact actuarial and functional senescence differently, and that these effects can interact with environmental stressors, such as immune challenges.",2017,"Thomas Leech, Steven M Sait, Amanda Bretman, Thomas Leech, Steven M Sait, Amanda Bretman"
Identification of Splicing Quantitative Trait Loci (sQTL) in Drosophila melanogaster with Developmental Lead (Pb 2+) Exposure,29114259,10.3389/fgene.2017.00145,"Lead (Pb) poisoning has been a major public health issue globally and the recent Flint water crisis has drawn nation-wide attention to its effects. To better understand how lead plays a role as a neurotoxin, we utilized the Drosophila melanogaster model to study the genetic effects of lead exposure during development and identified lead-responsive genes. In our previous studies, we have successfully identified hundreds of lead-responsive expression QTLs (eQTLs) by using RNA-seq analysis on heads collected from the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource. Cis-eQTLs, also known as allele-specific expression (ASE) polymorphisms, are generally single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter regions of genes that affect expression of the gene, such as by inhibiting the binding of transcription factors. Trans-eQTLs are genes that regulate mRNA levels for many genes, and are generally thought to be SNPs in trans-acting transcription or translation factors. In this study, we focused our attention on alternative splicing events that are affected by lead exposure. Splicing QTLs (sQTLs), which can be caused by SNPs that alter splicing or alternative splicing (AS), such as by changing the sequence-specific binding affinity of splicing factors to the pre-mRNA. We applied two methods in search for sQTLs by using RNA-seq data from control and lead-exposed w1118Drosophila heads. First, we used the fraction of reads in a gene that falls in each exon as the phenotype. Second, we directly compared the transcript counts among the various splicing isoforms as the phenotype. Among the 1,236 potential Pb-responsive sQTLs (p < 0.0001, FDR < 0.39), mostly cis-sQTLs, one of the most distinct genes is Dscam1 (Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule), which has over 30,000 potential alternative splicing isoforms. We have also identified a candidate Pb-responsive trans-sQTL hotspot that appears to regulate 129 genes that are enriched in the ""cation channel"" gene ontology category, suggesting a model in which alternative splicing of these channels might lead to an increase in the elimination of Pb2+ from the neurons encoding these channels. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that uses sQTL analyses to understand the neurotoxicology of an environmental toxin in any organism, and the first reported discovery of a candidate trans-sQTL hotspot.",2017,"Wen Qu, Katherine Gurdziel, Roger Pique-Regi, Douglas M Ruden, Wen Qu, Katherine Gurdziel, Roger Pique-Regi, Douglas M Ruden"
Intrachromosomal rearrangements mediated by hobo transposons in Drosophila melanogaster,2848256,10.1073/pnas.85.23.9153,"The recurring intrachromosomal rearrangements observed in an unstable X chromosome, designated Uc, of Drosophila melanogaster are shown to be mediated by hobo transposable elements. Each of 29 chromosome rearrangement breakpoints in 16 gross aberrations detected in the Uc-derived X chromosomes had a hobo element. In one particular unstable X chromosome line selected for detailed studies, a hobo element was found in each of the five hot spots for rearrangements. Furthermore, hobo elements at deletion hot spots were found to lie in the same orientation, whereas those hobo elements at inversion hot spots were in the opposite orientation. The restriction maps of two phage lambda clones containing rearrangement breakpoints indicated that a hobo element was inserted exactly at the breakpoints. Pairing of hobo elements in the same chromosome followed by recombination between the paired hobo elements is suggested as the explanation for the intrachromosomal aberrations observed in the Uc X chromosomes. A clear qualitative difference among the hobo elements in their ability to participate in rearrangement formation was noted. It was also found that each of the 11 recessive lethal mutations mapped in the 6F1-2 doublet had a hobo element in the doublet, whereas none of the 16 independent revertants of the mutation had a hobo element in the site. This observation indicates that hobo movement is responsible for production and subsequent instability of recessive lethal mutations in the 6F region of the Uc X chromosomes.",1988,"J K Lim, J K Lim"
Spatial and temporal expression of the period gene in Drosophila melanogaster,3129339,10.1101/gad.2.2.228,"The temporal and spatial expression of the period gene of Drosophila melanogaster has been analyzed by examining the expression of a per beta-galactosidase fusion gene in transformants and by in situ hybridization experiments with wild-type flies. Several strains of Drosophila melanogaster, transformed with the fusion gene, have been generated. The gene is active in mid-late embryos in the midline of the nervous system. Thereafter, beta-galactosidase activity is undetectable until the pupal stage when the prothoracic gland-corpora allata and the optic lobes are beta-galactosidase positive. In adults a surprisingly large number of tissues stain positively, including antennae, proboscis, eyes, optic lobes, cells of the central brain, cells of the thoracic ganglia, gut, Malpighian tubules, and ovarian follicle cells. The temporal pattern of expression agrees well with previous estimates made from developmental Northern blots with RNA extracted from wild-type animals.

None of the recombinant genes were effective in vitro templates. The defect in tRNA(Val3b) was demonstrated to reside in the 5' flanking region of the gene and deletion analysis indicated that no specific transcription inhibitor sequence was present 5' to the gene. The data suggest that the effect of 5' flanking sequences on in vitro transcription of the tRNA(Val3b) gene requires a specific relationship between the tRNA gene and the flanking sequence.",1988,"R M Mackay, D Horvath, L Duncan, G B Spiegelman, R M Mackay, D Horvath, L Duncan, G B Spiegelman"
Maternal effects of general and regional specificity on embryos of Drosophila melanogaster caused by dunce and rutabaga mutant combinations,28305785,10.1007/BF00380019,"The developmental patterns of embryos produced by female germ line cells homozygous for null-enzyme mutations of dunce and for dunce in combination with each of three different rutabaga mutations are compared with the normal pattern. At least three discrete developmental defects at progressive stages following fertilization can be identified and correlated with the loss of adenylate cyclase activity caused by rutabaga mutations, suggesting that the defects are caused by elevated cyclic AMP levels in female germ line cells. The earliest defect occurs soon after fertilization and affects DNA replication and mitosis, prevents nuclear migration, and leads to large polyploid nuclei. A later defect prevents cleavage nuclei from migrating into, or dividing in, the posterior region of the egg. The last affects the developmental behavior or fate of blastoderm cells. Some of these defects mimic those produced by previously described maternal-effect mutations.",1988,"Hugo Jozef Bellen, John Andrew Kiger Jr, Hugo Jozef Bellen, John Andrew Kiger Jr"
Rhabdomere turnover and rhodopsin cycle: maintenance of retinula cells in Drosophila melanogaster,3142967,10.1007/BF01189805,"Visual receptor maintenance in Drosophila involves turnover of membrane. Coated pits derived from rhabdomere and plasmalemma, coated vesicles and multivesicular bodies (MVBs) of about 0.5 micron diameter characterize the early autophagic steps. Smaller electron dense bodies (0.15 micron) merge with MVBs. These are likely to be primary lysosomes as suggested by histochemistry for acid phosphatase in normal flies and an acid phosphatase deficient mutant. Aggregates of extracellular membranes confirm an earlier report that exocytotic shedding may also be employed in the fly with its open rhabdomeres. Microspectrophotometry was used to determine aspects of cycling of visual pigment to begin to correlate with what is known about membrane cycling at the ultrastructural level. Visual pigment decreases to about half 3 h after dawn then builds back gradually to maximum before dawn. Our fixations of tissue have been at the post-dawn period when autophagy may be high as inferred from visual pigment levels. In attempts to optimize our visualization of the constructive phase of the turnover process, we developed the paradigm of carotenoid 'replacement therapy'. Carotenoid replaced flies show an increase in visual pigment possibly associated with a streaming of membrane into the rhabdomere. Aged flies, studied to determine how effective maintenance is, have a unique accumulation of extracellular debris, and a small fraction of the receptors eventually degenerate.",1988,"W S Stark, R Sapp, D Schilly, W S Stark, R Sapp, D Schilly"
Effects of starvation and experience on the response of Drosophila to alternative resources,28311269,10.1007/BF00377265,"We examined the effects of starvation and previous diet on the response of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans to alternative resources in the field by simultaneously releasing flies from different laboratory treatments then comparing the proportions captured on two different types of bait. Starvation altered response in all field releases. In conjunction with each release of starved and unstarved flies, the quality of the alternative resources as feeding and breeding sites was tested in the laboratory. Different kinds of tests often produced different rankings, making it difficult to rank resource quality unambiguously. Tentative rankings could be assigned when a resource that was slightly inferior by one criterion was greatly superior by another. Based on these rankings, two of three sets of resource comparisons support the hypothesis that unstarved flies are captured relatively more frequently on better resources than are starved flies. We also tested the effect of prior adult exposure to one of two alternative rotted fruits by comparing the proportions captured on each fruit in the field.

Mdg-1 mobile element polymorphism in selected Drosophila melanogaster populations,2852619,10.1007/BF00126005,"The changes in mdg-1 mobile element polymorphism that followed artificial selection for either high or low egg-to-adult viability in a Drosophila melanogaster population were investigated. The two selected subpopulations were thus characterized for fecundity, wing length, and number and location of the mdg-1 mobile element by in situ hybridization of the biotinylated--DNA on salivary gland chromosomes. The selected populations that differed greatly in egg-to-adult viability showed the same mean fecundity and identical values for intra and inter components of variances, intraclass correlation coefficient, and fluctuating asymmetry estimated on the wing length measurement. This indicates a non-correlated effect between deleterious mutations affecting viability and other fitness components. However, the two selected populations differed in their pattern of mdg-1 location, although the mean number of insertions per genome was not different from that of the initial population; hence, the number of insertions of the mdg-1 mobile element was independent of the effective population size. These results suggest that the mdg-1 copy number was regulated, and that during the selection process, drift and inbreeding made up new insertion patterns of the mdg-1 element in the selected populations. The results are discussed in the light of some recent theoretical models of the population dynamics of transposable elements.",1988,"C BiÃ©mont, C Terzian, C BiÃ©mont, C Terzian"
Fungal genotype determines survival of Drosophila melanogaster when competing with Aspergillus nidulans,29293643,10.1371/journal.pone.0190543,"Fungi produce an astonishing variety of secondary metabolites, some of which belong to the most toxic compounds in the living world. Several fungal metabolites have anti-insecticidal properties which may yield advantages to the fungus in competition with insects for exploitation of environmental resources. Using the Drosophila melanogaster/Aspergillus nidulans ecological model system to assess secondary metabolite mutant genotypes, we find a major role for the veA allele in insect/fungal confrontations that exceeds the influence of other factors such as LaeA. VeA along with LaeA is a member of a transcriptional complex governing secondary metabolism in A. nidulans. However, historically a mutant veA allele, veA1 reduced in secondary metabolite output, has been used in many studies of this model organism. To test the significance of this allele in our system, Aspergillus nidulans veA wild type, veA1, ?veA and ?laeA were evaluated in confrontation assays to analyze egg laying activity, and the survival rate of larvae. The veA1 genetic background led to a significant increase of larval survival. Adult flies were observed almost exclusively on veA1, ?veA or ?laeA genetic backgrounds, suggesting a role for the velvet complex in insect/fungal interactions. This effect was most profound using the veA1 mutant. Hence, larval survival in confrontations is highly affected by the fungal genotype.",2018,"Annika Regulin, Frank Kempken, Annika Regulin, Frank Kempken"
Consequences of resistance evolution in a Cas9-based sex conversion-suppression gene drive for insect pest management,29844184,10.1073/pnas.1713825115,"The use of a site-specific homing-based gene drive for insect pest control has long been discussed, but the easy design of such systems has become possible only with the recent establishment of CRISPR/Cas9 technology. In this respect, novel targets for insect pest management are provided by new discoveries regarding sex determination. Here, we present a model for a suppression gene drive designed to cause an all-male population collapse in an agricultural pest insect. To evaluate the molecular details of such a sex conversion-based suppression gene drive experimentally, we implemented this strategy in Drosophila melanogaster to serve as a safe model organism. We generated a Cas9-based homing gene-drive element targeting the transformer gene and showed its high efficiency for sex conversion from females to males. However, nonhomologous end joining increased the rate of mutagenesis at the target site, which resulted in the emergence of drive-resistant alleles and therefore curbed the gene drive. This confirms previous studies that simple homing CRISPR/Cas9 gene-drive designs will be ineffective. Nevertheless, by performing population dynamics simulations using the parameters we obtained in D. melanogaster and by adjusting the model for the agricultural pest Ceratitis capitata, we were able to identify adequate modifications that could be successfully applied for the management of wild Mediterranean fruit fly populations using our proposed sex conversion-based suppression gene-drive strategy.",2018,"Mohammad KaramiNejadRanjbar, Kolja N Eckermann, Hassan M M Ahmed, HÃ©ctor M SÃ¡nchez C, Stefan Dippel, John M Marshall, Ernst A Wimmer, Mohammad KaramiNejadRanjbar, Kolja N Eckermann, Hassan M M Ahmed, HÃ©ctor M SÃ¡nchez C, Stefan Dippel, John M Marshall, Ernst A Wimmer"
Drosophila melanogaster establishes a species-specific mutualistic interaction with stable gut-colonizing bacteria,29975680,10.1371/journal.pbio.2005710,"Animals live together with diverse bacteria that can impact their biology. In Drosophila melanogaster, gut-associated bacterial communities are relatively simple in composition but also have a strong impact on host development and physiology. It is generally assumed that gut bacteria in D. melanogaster are transient and their constant ingestion with food is required to maintain their presence in the gut. Here, we identify bacterial species from wild-caught D. melanogaster that stably associate with the host independently of continuous inoculation. Moreover, we show that specific Acetobacter wild isolates can proliferate in the gut. We further demonstrate that the interaction between D. melanogaster and the wild isolated Acetobacter thailandicus is mutually beneficial and that the stability of the gut association is key to this mutualism. The stable population in the gut of D. melanogaster allows continuous bacterial spreading into the environment, which is advantageous to the bacterium itself. The bacterial dissemination is in turn advantageous to the host because the next generation of flies develops in the presence of this particularly beneficial bacterium. A. thailandicus leads to a faster host development and higher fertility of emerging adults when compared to other bacteria isolated from wild-caught flies. Furthermore, A. thailandicus is sufficient and advantageous when D. melanogaster develops in axenic or freshly collected figs, respectively. This isolate of A. thailandicus colonizes several genotypes of D. melanogaster but not the closely related D. simulans, indicating that the stable association is host specific. This work establishes a new conceptual model to understand D. melanogaster-gut microbiota interactions in an ecological context; stable interactions can be mutualistic through microbial farming, a common strategy in insects. Moreover, these results develop the use of D. melanogaster as a model to study gut microbiota proliferation and colonization.",2018,"InÃªs S Pais, Rita S Valente, Marta Sporniak, Luis Teixeira"

Serine metabolism in the brain regulates starvation-induced sleep suppression in Drosophila melanogaster,29915051,10.1073/pnas.1719033115,"Sleep and metabolism are physiologically and behaviorally intertwined; however, the molecular basis for their interaction remains poorly understood. Here, we identified a serine metabolic pathway as a key mediator for starvation-induced sleep suppression. Transcriptome analyses revealed that enzymes involved in serine biosynthesis were induced upon starvation in Drosophila melanogaster brains. Genetic mutants of astray (aay), a fly homolog of the rate-limiting phosphoserine phosphatase in serine biosynthesis, displayed reduced starvation-induced sleep suppression. In contrast, a hypomorphic mutation in a serine/threonine-metabolizing enzyme, serine/threonine dehydratase (stdh), exaggerated starvation-induced sleep suppression. Analyses of double mutants indicated that aay and stdh act on the same genetic pathway to titrate serine levels in the head as well as to adjust starvation-induced sleep behaviors. RNA interference-mediated depletion of aay expression in neurons, using cholinergic Gal4 drivers, phenocopied aay mutants, while a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist selectively rescued the exaggerated starvation-induced sleep suppression in stdh mutants. Taken together, these data demonstrate that neural serine metabolism controls sleep during starvation, possibly via cholinergic signaling.

In addition, we show that ontogenetic changes in sleep amount, twitch, and place preference are preserved across sleep mutants with lesions in distinct molecular pathways.

      We generated a null mutant of the Drosophila AIP orthologue, CG1847, a gene located on the Xchromosome, which displayed lethality at larval stage in hemizygous knockout male mutants (CG1847exon1_3 ). We tested human missense variants of 'unknown significance', with 'pathogenic' variants as positive control.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We found that human AIP can functionally substitute for CG1847, as heterologous overexpression of human AIP rescued male CG1847exon1_3 lethality, while a truncated version of AIP did not restore viability. Flies harbouring patient-specific missense AIP variants (p.C238Y, p.I13N, p.W73R and p.G272D) failed to rescue CG1847exon1_3 mutants, while seven variants (p.R16H, p.Q164R, p.E293V, p.A299V, p.R304Q, p.R314W and p.R325Q) showed rescue, supporting a non-pathogenic role for these latter variants corresponding to prevalence and clinical data.

      Our in vivo model represents a valuable tool to characterise putative disease-causing human AIP variants and assist the genetic counselling and management of families carrying AIP variants.",2018,"Elena Daniela Aflorei, Benjamin Klapholz, Chenghao Chen, Serban Radian, Anca Neluta Dragu, Nina Moderau, Chrisostomos Prodromou, Paulo S Ribeiro, Ralf Stanewsky, MÃ¡rta Korbonits, Elena Daniela Aflorei, Benjamin Klapholz, Chenghao Chen, Serban Radian, Anca Neluta Dragu, Nina Moderau, Chrisostomos Prodromou, Paulo S Ribeiro, Ralf Stanewsky, MÃ¡rta Korbonits"
HSP90 as a global genetic modifier for male genital morphology in Drosophila melanogaster,30221481,10.1111/evo.13598,"The molecular chaperone protein HSP90 has been proposed to modulate genotype-phenotype relationship in a broad range of organisms. We explore the proposed genetic modifier effect of HSP90 through a genomewide analysis. Here, we show that HSP90 functions as a genetic modifier of genital morphology in Drosophila melanogaster. We identified a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with an HSP90-dependent effect by using genome wide association analysis. We classified the SNPs into the ones under capacitance effect (smaller allelic effect under HSP90 inhibition) or the ones under potentiation effect (larger allelic effect under HSP90 inhibition). Although the majority of SNPs are under capacitance, there are a large number of SNPs under potentiation. This observation provides support for a model in which Hsp90 is not described exclusively as a ""genetic capacitor,"" but is described more broadly as a ""genetic modifier."" Because the majority of the candidate genes estimated from SNPs with an HSP90-dependent effect in the current study has never been reported to interact with HSP90 directly, the global genetic modifier effect of HSP90 may be exhibited through epistatic interactions in gene regulatory networks.",2018,"Kazuo H Takahashi, Motoyuki Ishimori, Hiroyoshi Iwata, Kazuo H Takahashi, Motoyuki Ishimori, Hiroyoshi Iwata"
Influence of extreme heat or cold stresses on body pigmentation of Drosophila melanogaster,29496004,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.01.005,"Thoracic and abdominal pigmentation were measured in Drosophila melanogaster under a cold circadian stress (8-25 Â°C) and a heat one (18-33 Â°C) and compared to the phenotypes observed under similar but constant temperatures of 17 or 25 Â°C respectively. An isofemale line design permitted to submit each line (full sibs) to the four thermal regimes. Under cold stress, the pigmentation was similar to the value observed at constant 25 Â°C, suggesting a kind of functional dominance of the high temperature phase. In all cases, thermal stresses increased the individual environmental variance, i.e., increased the developmental instability. Genetic correlations between lines were not modified by the stresses but provided some unexpected and surprising results, which should be confirmed by further investigations: for example, negative correlations between pigmentation and body size or sternopleural bristle number. As a whole, the data do not confirm the hypothesis that under stressing conditions a hidden genetic variability could be unravelled, permitting a faster adaptation to environmental changes.",2018,"Georges PÃ©tavy, Brigitte Moreteau, Jean R David, Patricia Gibert, Georges PÃ©tavy, Brigitte Moreteau, Jean R David, Patricia Gibert"
Physicochemical characterization of polysaccharides from Chlorella pyrenoidosa and its anti-ageing effects in Drosophila melanogaster,29421048,10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.12.077,"The physicochemical characteristics and in vitro antioxidant and in vivo anti-ageing activities of partial purified Chlorella pyrenoidosa polysaccharides (PCPPs) were investigated. The building blocks of PCPPs were mainly composed of D-glucose, D-galactose and D-mannose. The average molecular weight of PCPPs was 9,950 Da. In vitro antioxidant activity assays showed that PCPPs could effectively scavenge hydroxyl, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, and superoxide radicals, with stronger effect on hydroxyl radicals. Furthermore, the mean lifespan of the male and female Drosophila melanogaster was extended by 11.5% and 10.6%, respectively. This was accompanied by an increase in the total activity of the endogenous antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase in young or old D. melanogaster administered with PCPPs. Moreover, a gender-dependent difference was observed both in lifespan and antioxidant enzyme activities in D. melanogaster. The results indicated that C. pyrenoidosa polysaccharides are potential natural antioxidants in extending lifespan.",2018,"Yixuan Chen, Xiaoyan Liu, Linxiu Wu, Aijun Tong, Lina Zhao, Bin Liu, Chao Zhao"
Calmodulin Enhances Cryptochrome Binding to INAD in Drosophila Photoreceptors,30177872,10.3389/fnmol.2018.00280,"Light is the main environmental stimulus that synchronizes the endogenous timekeeping systems in most terrestrial organisms. Drosophila cryptochrome (dCRY) is a light-responsive flavoprotein that detects changes in light intensity and wavelength around dawn and dusk. We have previously shown that dCRY acts through Inactivation No Afterpotential D (INAD) in a light-dependent manner on the Signalplex, a multiprotein complex that includes visual-signaling molecules, suggesting a role for dCRY in fly vision. Here, we predict and demonstrate a novel Ca2+-dependent interaction between dCRY and calmodulin (CaM). Through yeast two hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and calorimetric analyses we were able to identify and characterize a CaM binding motif in the dCRY C-terminus. Similarly, we also detailed the CaM binding site of the scaffold protein INAD and demonstrated that CaM bridges dCRY and INAD to form a ternary complex in vivo. Our results suggest a process whereby a rapid dCRY light response stimulates an interaction with INAD, which can be further consolidated by a novel mechanism regulated by CaM.",2018,"Gabriella Margherita Mazzotta, Massimo Bellanda, Giovanni Minervini, Milena Damulewicz, Paola Cusumano, Simona Aufiero, Monica Stefani, Barbara Zambelli, Stefano Mammi, Rodolfo Costa, Silvio C E Tosatto, Gabriella Margherita Mazzotta, Massimo Bellanda, Giovanni Minervini, Milena Damulewicz, Paola Cusumano, Simona Aufiero, Monica Stefani, Barbara Zambelli, Stefano Mammi, Rodolfo Costa, Silvio C E Tosatto"
Standardized phytotherapic extracts rescue anomalous locomotion and electrophysiological responses of TDP-43 Drosophila melanogaster model of ALS,30375462,10.1038/s41598-018-34452-1,"Findings from studies using animal models expressing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mutations in RNA-binding proteins, such as Transactive Response DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43), indicate that this protein, which is involved in multiple functions, including transcriptional regulation and pre-mRNA splicing, represents a key candidate in ALS development. This study focuses on characterizing, in a Drosophila genetic model of ALS (TDP-43), the effects of Mucuna pruriens (Mpe) and Withania somnifera (Wse). Electrophysiological and behavioural data in TDP-43 mutant flies revealed anomalous locomotion (i.e. impaired climbing with unexpected hyperactivity) and sleep dysregulation. These features, in agreement with previous findings with a different ALS model, were at least partially, rescued by treatment with Mpe and Wse. In addition, electrophysiological recordings from dorsal longitudinal muscle fibers and behavioral observations of TDP-43 flies exposed to the volatile anaesthetics, diethyl ether or chloroform, showed paradoxical responses, which were normalized upon Mpe or Wse treatment. Hence, given the involvement of some potassium channels in the effects of anaesthetics, our results also hint toward a possible dysregulation of some potassium channels in the ALS-TDP-43 Drosophila model, that might shed new light on future therapeutic strategies pertaining to ALS.",2018,"Riccardo Maccioni, Maria Dolores Setzu, Giuseppe Talani, Paolo Solari, Ameya Kasture, Sonja Sucic, Simona Porru, Patrizia Muroni, Enrico Sanna, Sanjay Kasture, Elio Acquas, Anna Liscia, Riccardo Maccioni, Maria Dolores Setzu, Giuseppe Talani, Paolo Solari, Ameya Kasture, Sonja Sucic, Simona Porru, Patrizia Muroni, Enrico Sanna, Sanjay Kasture, Elio Acquas, Anna Liscia"
A complex peripheral code for salt taste in Drosophila,30307393,10.7554/eLife.37167,"Each taste modality is generally encoded by a single, molecularly defined, population of sensory cells. However, salt stimulates multiple taste pathways in mammals and insects, suggesting a more complex code for salt taste. Here, we examine salt coding in Drosophila. After creating a comprehensive molecular map comprised of five discrete sensory neuron classes across the fly labellum, we find that four are activated by salt: two exhibiting characteristics of 'low salt' cells, and two 'high salt' classes. Behaviorally, low salt attraction depends primarily on 'sweet' neurons, with additional input from neurons expressing the ionotropic receptor IR94e. High salt avoidance is mediated by 'bitter' neurons and a population of glutamatergic neurons expressing Ppk23. Interestingly, the impact of these glutamatergic neurons depends on prior salt consumption. These results support a complex model for salt coding in flies that combinatorially integrates inputs from across cell types to afford robust and flexible salt behaviors.",2018,"Alexandria H Jaeger, Molly Stanley, Zachary F Weiss, Pierre-Yves Musso, Rachel Cw Chan, Han Zhang, Damian Feldman-Kiss, Michael D Gordon, Alexandria H Jaeger, Molly Stanley, Zachary F Weiss, Pierre-Yves Musso, Rachel Cw Chan, Han Zhang, Damian Feldman-Kiss, Michael D Gordon"
Chronic exposure to acephate triggers ROS-mediated injuries at organismal and sub-organismal levels of Drosophila melanogaster,30310664,10.1039/c8tx00052b,"The present study demonstrates ROS-mediated organismal and sub-organismal injuries in Drosophila melanogaster following chronic acephate exposure. Larvae and adults of Drosophila were reared on food supplemented with sub-lethal concentrations (1-6 Î¼g mL-1) of acephate (LC50 8.71 Î¼g mL-1). The longevity of the treated adults was reduced to half at 6 Î¼g mL-1 exposure along with declined neuromuscular coordination and physical activities. Apparent developmental defects in the compound eyes were confirmed through the detection of apoptotic lesions in larval eye imaginal discs. The larval gut manifested tissue damage at various sites. Neural and fat cell viability was reduced by ??.89- and ??.38-fold at 6 Î¼g mL-1 acephate treatment, respectively. A significant reduction in hemocyte viability confirmed the immunotoxic potential of acephate. Nearly 1-3-fold enhancement in the expression of OS markers (MDA, protein carbonyl contents, SOD, catalase and HSP70) in the treated larvae served as evidence of ROS production. The post-treatment increase in CYP450 and GST activities reflects the 'switch-on' states of the phase-I and phase-II detoxification mechanism. The genotoxic potential of acephate was confirmed through alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis. Thus, the findings of the present study validate the fact that besides traditional cholinesterase inhibition, chronic sub-lethal exposure to acephate potentially induces ROS-mediated toxic responses in Drosophila.",2018,"Prem Rajak, Salma Khatun, Moumita Dutta, Moutushi Mandi, Sumedha Roy, Prem Rajak, Salma Khatun, Moumita Dutta, Moutushi Mandi, Sumedha Roy"
Overexpression of Larp4B downregulates dMyc and reduces cell and organ sizes in Drosophila,29462618,10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.148,"Regulation of cell and organ sizes is fundamental for all organisms, but its molecular basis is not fully understood. Here we performed a gain-of-function screen and identified larp4B whose overexpression reduces cell and organ sizes in Drosophila melanogaster. Larp4B is a member of La-related proteins (LARPs) containing an LA motif and an adjacent RNA recognition motif (RRM), and play diverse roles in RNA metabolism. However, the function of Larp4B has remained poorly characterized. We generated transgenic flies overexpressing wild-type Larp4B or a deletion variant lacking the LA and RRM domains, and demonstrated that the RNA-binding domains are essential for Larp4B to reduce cell and organ sizes. We found that the larp4B-induced phenotype was suppressed by dMyc overexpression, which promotes cell growth and survival. Furthermore, overexpression of larp4B decreased dMyc protein levels, whereas its loss-of-function mutation had an opposite effect.

Synthesis of the major adult cuticle proteins of Drosophila melanogaster during hypoderm differentiation,3918895,10.1016/0012-1606(85)90324-0,"Differentiating imaginal hypodermal cells of Drosophila melanogaster form adult cuticle during the second half of the pupal stage (about 40 to 93 hr postpupariation). A group of proteins with molecular weights of 23,000, 20,000, and 14,000 is identified as putative major wing cuticle proteins with the following biological properties: These proteins are abundant components of cuticle and are major synthetic products of cuticle-secreting hypodermal cells. They are leucine-rich and methionine-free and are the most prominent proteins of this type synthesized by wing hypoderm at 65 hr, during the period of procuticle formation. Electron microscopic autoradiography shows that leucine-rich, methionine-free proteins specifically localize to the apical cell surface and newly secreted cuticle of 65-hr wing cells. This strongly suggests the export of these proteins to the cuticle. Lastly, these proteins undergo a reduction in extractability just after eclosion, during the period of cuticle protein crosslinking (sclerotization). The synthesis of these major hypoderm proteins is temporally regulated in development. In wing cells, the 14-kDa proteins are synthesized first, from 53 to 78 hr, and the 20- and 23-kDa proteins are synthesized from 63 to 93 hr. The pattern of synthesis for these proteins is similar in abdominal cells but delayed by 6 to 10 hr. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis shows that each of the 23-, 20-, and 14-kDa size classes contains at least two component polypeptides. Patterns of protein synthesis in cells of the imaginal hypodermis are regulated in a precise temporal sequence during the production of adult cuticle.

The four small hsp genes share strong sequence homologies between themselves which were detected here by cross-hybridization. Under the same stringency conditions, each of the genes 1, 2 and 3 hybridize to some of the small hsp genes. By DNA sequencing of gene 1, the homology was localized within the same two regions already conserved between the small hsp genes: a central region of 83 amino acids, homologous with the mammalian alpha crystallin and the first 15 N-terminal amino acids. The transcriptional inducibility of the genes 1, 2 and 3 was also compared with that of the four small hsp genes during various stages of Drosophila development at either the normal growth temperature or after a heat shock. We confirm previous reports on the developmental patterns of all seven genes and find moreover that genes 1, 2 and 3 are heat-shock inducible at any of the stages tested. We conclude that genes 1, 2 and 3 are also heat shock genes. Therefore, the locus 67B contains seven, not four, small heat shock genes.",1985,"A Ayme, A TissiÃ¨res, A Ayme, A TissiÃ¨res"

We determine that vertebrate insulin reduces West Nile virus (WNV) replication in Drosophila melanogaster as well as WNV, Zika, and dengue virus titers in mosquito cells. Mechanistically, we show that insulin signaling activates the JAK/STAT, but not RNAi, pathway via ERK to control infection in Drosophila cells and Culex mosquitoes through an integrated immune response.

Social foraging extends associative odor-food memory expression in an automated learning assay for Drosophila melanogaster,31527181,10.1242/jeb.207241,"Animals socially interact during foraging and share information about the quality and location of food sources. The mechanisms of social information transfer during foraging have been mostly studied at the behavioral level, and its underlying neural mechanisms are largely unknown. Fruit flies have become a model for studying the neural bases of social information transfer, because they provide a large genetic toolbox to monitor and manipulate neuronal activity, and they show a rich repertoire of social behaviors. Fruit flies aggregate, they use social information for choosing a suitable mating partner and oviposition site, and they show better aversive learning when in groups. However, the effects of social interactions on associative odor-food learning have not yet been investigated. Here, we present an automated learning and memory assay for walking flies that allows the study of the effect of group size on social interactions and on the formation and expression of associative odor-food memories.

The Nopp140 gene in Drosophila melanogaster displays length polymorphisms in its large repetitive second exon,31006039,10.1007/s00438-019-01568-6,"Nopp140, often called the nucleolar and Cajal body phosphoprotein (NOLC1), is an evolutionarily conserved chaperone for the transcription and processing of rRNA during ribosome subunit assembly. Metazoan Nopp140 contains an amino terminal LisH dimerization domain and a highly conserved carboxyl domain. A large central domain consists of alternating basic and acidic motifs of low sequence complexity. Orthologous versions of Nopp140 contain variable numbers of repeating basic-acidic units. While vertebrate Nopp140 genes use multiple exons to encode the central domain, the Nopp140 gene in Drosophila uses exclusively exon 2 to encode the central domain. Here, we define three overlapping repeat sequence patterns (P, P', and P?? within the central domain of D. melanogaster Nopp140. These repeat patterns are poorly conserved in other Drosophila species. We also describe a length polymorphism in exon 2 that pertains specifically to the P' pattern in D. melanogaster. The pattern displays either two or three 96 base pair repeats, respectively, referred to as Nopp140-Short and Nopp140-Long. Fly lines homozygous for one or the other allele, or heterozygous for both alleles, show no discernible phenotypes. PCR characterization of the long and short alleles shows a poorly defined, artifactual bias toward amplifying the long allele over the short allele. The significance of this polymorphism will be in discerning the largely unknown properties of Nopp140's large central domain in rDNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis.",2019,"Sonu Shrestha Baral, Patrick J DiMario"
Heat-hardening effects on mating success at high temperature in Drosophila melanogaster,30784483,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.02.001,"Reproduction is strongly influenced by environmental temperature in insects. At high temperature, mating success could be influenced not only by basal (non-inducible) thermotolerance but also by inducible plastic responses. Here, mating success at high temperature was tested in flies carrying contrasting genotypes of heat resistance in Drosophila melanogaster. The possible heat-hardening effect was tested. Mating success did not differ between heat-resistant and heat-sensitive genotypes when tested both at high (33 Â°C) and benign (25 Â°C) temperature, independently of the heat-hardening status. Importantly, heat-hardening pre-treatment increased in a 70% the number of matings at 33 Â°C in a mass-mating experiment. Further, mating latency at 33 Â°C was shorter with heat hardening than without it in single-pair assays Heat-hardening had previously been showed to improve short-term thermotolerance in many organisms including Drosophila, and the present results show that heat hardening also improve mating success at elevated temperature. Previous exposures to a mild heat stress improve short-term mating success as a plastic response of ecological relevance. Such heat-hardening effects on mating success should be relevant for predicting potential evolutionary responses to any possible current scenery of global warming, as well as in sterile insect release programs for pest control in elevated temperature environments.",2019,"L Stazione, F M Norry, P Sambucetti, L Stazione, F M Norry, P Sambucetti"

Dietary ingestion of PQ for 3 days resulted in the loss of citrate synthase content, respiratory capacity impairment and exacerbated H2O2 production per mitochondrial unit related to complex I dysfunction, and high lactate accumulation in fly heads. PQ intoxication lead to 1) the loss of ELAV (embryonic lethal abnormal vision) and Î±-spectrin, essential proteins of neuronal viability and synaptic stability; 2) increased gamma-secretase activity, an enzyme related to APP release; and 3) increased the amyloid fibrils contents. All these toxic effects induced by PQ were prevented by concomitant dietary ingestion of EPA/DHA, suggesting that a neuroprotective effect of ?-3 also involves mitochondrial protection. In conclusion, concomitant EPA and DHA ingestion protects against PQ-induced neuronal and mitochondrial dysfunctions frequently found in neurodegenerative processes reinforcing its protective role against environmental neurodegenerative diseases.",2019,"Anderson de Oliveira Souza, Carlos AntÃ´nio Couto-Lima, Carlos Henrique Rocha CatalÃ£o, Nilton Nascimento Santos-JÃºnior, JÃºlia Fernanda Dos Santos, Maria Jose Alves da Rocha, Luciane Carla Alberici, Anderson de Oliveira Souza, Carlos AntÃ´nio Couto-Lima, Carlos Henrique Rocha CatalÃ£o, Nilton Nascimento Santos-JÃºnior, JÃºlia Fernanda Dos Santos, Maria Jose Alves da Rocha, Luciane Carla Alberici"

Drosophila Mediator Subunit Med1 Is Required for GATA-Dependent Developmental Processes: Divergent Binding Interfaces for Conserved Coactivator Functions,30670567,10.1128/MCB.00477-18,"DNA-bound transcription factors (TFs) governing developmental gene regulation have been proposed to recruit polymerase II machinery at gene promoters through specific interactions with dedicated subunits of the evolutionarily conserved Mediator (MED) complex. However, whether such MED subunit-specific functions and partnerships have been conserved during evolution has been poorly investigated. To address this issue, we generated the first Drosophila melanogaster loss-of-function mutants for Med1, known as a specific cofactor for GATA TFs and hormone nuclear receptors in mammals. We show that Med1 is required for cell proliferation and hematopoietic differentiation depending on the GATA TF Serpent (Srp). Med1 physically binds Srp in cultured cells and in vitro through its conserved GATA zinc finger DNA-binding domain and the divergent Med1 C terminus. Interestingly, GATA-Srp interaction occurs through the longest Med1 isoform, suggesting a functional diversity of MED complex populations. Furthermore, we show that Med1 acts as a coactivator for the GATA factor Pannier during thoracic development. In conclusion, the Med1 requirement for GATA-dependent regulatory processes is a common feature in insects and mammals, although binding interfaces have diverged.

The ZCMM was trained and tested using the nucleosomal and linker sequences determined by support vector machine (SVM) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), and experimental results showed that the sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), accuracy (Acc), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) values for ZCMM were 91.40%, 96.56%, 96.75%, and 0.88, respectively, and the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value was 0.972.

The maximum AUC values of the four species were 0.982, 0.861, 0.912 and 0.911, respectively. Another independent dataset for S. cerevisiae was used to predict nucleosome positioning.

Compared with the Guo's method 'iNuc-PseKNC', the results of ZCMM for D. melanogaster were better. Meanwhile, the ZCMM was compared with some experimental data in vitro and in vivo for S. cerevisiae, and the results showed that the nucleosomes predicted by ZCMM were highly consistent with those confirmed by these experiments. Therefore, it was further confirmed that the ZCMM method has good accuracy and reliability in predicting nucleosome positioning.",2019,"Ying Cui, Zelong Xu, Jianzhong Li, Ying Cui, Zelong Xu, Jianzhong Li"
Activity-dependent visualization and control of neural circuits for courtship behavior in the fly Drosophila melanogaster,30837311,10.1073/pnas.1814628116,"Males of Drosophila melanogaster exhibit stereotypic courtship behavior through which they assess potential mates by processing multimodal sensory information. Although previous studies revealed important neural circuits involved in this process, the full picture of circuits that participate in male courtship remains elusive. Here, we established a genetic tool to visualize or optogenetically reactivate neural circuits activated upon specific behavior, exploiting promoter activity of a neural activity-induced gene Hr38 With this approach, we visualized neural circuits activated in the male brain and the ventral nerve cord when a male interacted with a female. The labeling of neural circuits was additively dependent on inputs from antennae and foreleg tarsi. In addition, neural circuits that express the sex-determining gene fruitless or doublesex were extensively labeled by interaction with a female. Furthermore, optogenetic reactivation of the labeled neural circuits induced courtship posture. With this mapping system, we found that a fruitless-positive neural cluster aSP2 was labeled when a male interacted with a female, in addition to previously characterized neurons. Silencing of neurons including aSP2 led to frequent interruption of courtship and significant reduction of mating success rate without affecting latency to start courtship, suggesting that these neurons are required for courtship persistency important for successful copulation. Overall, these results demonstrate that activity-dependent labeling can be used as a powerful tool not only in vertebrates, but also in invertebrates, to identify neural circuits regulating innate behavior.",2019,"Seika Takayanagi-Kiya, Taketoshi Kiya, Seika Takayanagi-Kiya, Taketoshi Kiya"
Structural variants exhibit widespread allelic heterogeneity and shape variation in complex traits,31653862,10.1038/s41467-019-12884-1,"It has been hypothesized that individually-rare hidden structural variants (SVs) could account for a significant fraction of variation in complex traits. Here we identified more than 20,000 euchromatic SVs from 14 Drosophila melanogaster genome assemblies, of which ~40% are invisible to high specificity short-read genotyping approaches. SVs are common, with 31.5% of diploid individuals harboring a SV in genes larger than 5kb, and 24% harboring multiple SVs in genes larger than 10kb. SV minor allele frequencies are rarer than amino acid polymorphisms, suggesting that SVs are more deleterious. We show that a number of functionally important genes harbor previously hidden structural variants likely to affect complex phenotypes. Furthermore, SVs are overrepresented in candidate genes associated with quantitative trait loci mapped using the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource. We conclude that SVs are ubiquitous, frequently constitute a heterogeneous allelic series, and can act as rare alleles of large effect.",2019,"Mahul Chakraborty, J J Emerson, Stuart J Macdonald, Anthony D Long, Mahul Chakraborty, J J Emerson, Stuart J Macdonald, Anthony D Long"
Biological Effects of Food Coloring in In Vivo and In Vitro Model Systems,31137639,10.3390/foods8050176,"(1) Background: The suitability of certain food colorings is nowadays in discussion because of the effects of these compounds on human health.

(2) Methods: In vivo toxicity, antitoxicity, and longevity assays using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster and in vitro cytotoxicity, DNA fragmentation, and methylation status assays using HL-60 tumor human cell line were carried out. (3) Results: Our in vivo results showed safe effects in Drosophila for all the food coloring treatments, non-significant protective potential against an oxidative toxin, and different effects on the lifespan of flies. The in vitro results in HL-60 cells, showed that the tested food colorings increased tumor cell growth but did not induce any DNA damage or modifications in the DNA methylation status at their acceptable daily intake (ADI) concentrations.

Dimorphic sperm formation by Sex-lethal,31036645,10.1073/pnas.1820101116,"Sex is determined by diverse mechanisms and master sex-determination genes are highly divergent, even among closely related species. Therefore, it is possible that homologs of master sex-determination genes might have alternative functions in different species. Herein, we focused on Sex-lethal (Sxl), which is the master sex-determination gene in Drosophila melanogaster and is necessary for female germline development. It has been widely shown that the sex-determination function of Sxl in Drosophilidae species is not conserved in other insects of different orders. We investigated the function of Sxl in the lepidopteran insect Bombyx mori In lepidopteran insects (moths and butterflies), spermatogenesis results in two different types of sperm: nucleated fertile eupyrene sperm and anucleate nonfertile parasperm, also known as apyrene sperm. Genetic analyses using Sxl mutants revealed that the gene is indispensable for proper morphogenesis of apyrene sperm. Similarly, our analyses using Sxl mutants clearly demonstrate that apyrene sperm are necessary for eupyrene sperm migration from the bursa copulatrix to the spermatheca. Therefore, apyrene sperm is necessary for successful fertilization of eupyrene sperm in B. mori Although Sxl is essential for oogenesis in D. melanogaster, it also plays important roles in spermatogenesis in B. mori Therefore, the ancestral function of Sxl might be related to germline development.",2019,"Hiroki Sakai, Hiroyuki Oshima, Kodai Yuri, Hiroki Gotoh, Takaaki Daimon, Toshinobu Yaginuma, Ken Sahara, Teruyuki Niimi, Hiroki Sakai, Hiroyuki Oshima, Kodai Yuri, Hiroki Gotoh, Takaaki Daimon, Toshinobu Yaginuma, Ken Sahara, Teruyuki Niimi"

Although AMPs are widely recognized for their broad-spectrum activity against bacteria, fungi, and viruses, their activity against protozoan parasites has not been investigated in detail. In this study, we tested 10 AMPs from three different insect species: the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella (cecropin A-D), the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (drosocin, Mtk-1 and Mtk-2), and the blow fly Lucilia sericata (LSerPRP-2, LSerPRP-3 and stomoxyn). We tested each AMP against the protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum which is responsible for the most severe form of malaria in humans. We also evaluated the impact of these insect AMPs on mouse and pig erythrocytes. Whereas all AMPs showed low hemolytic effects towards mouse and pig erythrocytes, only D. melanogaster Mtk-1 and Mtk-2 significantly inhibited the growth of P. falciparum at low concentrations.

Effects of Dual Exposure to the Herbicides Atrazine and Paraquat on Adult Climbing Ability and Longevity in Drosophila melanogaster,31717666,10.3390/insects10110398,"Anthropomorphic effects are changing the planet, and therefore, organisms are being exposed to many new biotic and abiotic stressors. Exposure to multiple stressors can affect organisms in ways that are different than the sum of their individual effects, and these interactions are often difficult to predict. Atrazine and paraquat are two of the most widely used herbicides in the United States, and are individually known to increase oxidative damage, affect dopaminergic functioning, reduce longevity, and alter motor ability in non-target organisms. We measured the effects of individual and combined exposure to low doses of atrazine and paraquat on climbing ability and longevity of Drosophila melanogaster. Atrazine and paraquat interact to affect D. melanogaster climbing ability and longevity in different ways. Atrazine appeared to have a weak mitigative effect against the decrease in climbing ability caused by paraquat. In contrast, combined exposure to atrazine and paraquat had detrimental synergistic effects on female longevity. Overall, this study shows that atrazine and paraquat can interact and that it is important to measure several traits when assessing the consequences of exposure to multiple stressors. Future studies should continue to assess the impacts of stressor interactions on organisms, as many combinations have never been examined.",2019,"Pamela C Lovejoy, Anthony C Fiumera, Pamela C Lovejoy, Anthony C Fiumera"
Effects of developmental plasticity on heat tolerance may be mediated by changes in cell size in Drosophila melanogaster,31829515,10.1111/1744-7917.12742,"There is a growing interest in the physiology underpinning heat tolerance of ectotherms and their responses to the ongoing rise in temperature. However, there is no consensus about the underlying physiological mechanisms. According to ""the maintain aerobic scope and regulate oxygen supply"" hypothesis, responses to warming at different organizational levels contribute to the ability to safeguard energy metabolism via aerobic pathways. At the cellular level, a decrease in cell size increases the capacity for the uptake of resources (e.g., food and oxygen), but the maintenance of electrochemical gradients across cellular membranes implies greater energetic costs in small cells. In this study, we investigated how different rearing temperatures affected cell size and heat tolerance in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We tested the hypothesis that smaller-celled flies are more tolerant to acute, intense heat stress whereas larger-celled flies are more tolerant to chronic, mild heat stress. We used the thermal tolerance landscape framework, which incorporates the intensity and duration of thermal challenge. Rearing temperatures strongly affected both cell size and survival times. We found different effects of developmental plasticity on tolerance to either chronic or acute heat stress. Warm-reared flies had both smaller cells and exhibited higher survival times under acute, intense heat stress when compared to cold-reared flies. However, under chronic, mild heat stress, the situation was reversed and cold-reared flies, consisting of larger cells, showed better survival. These differences in heat tolerance could have resulted from direct effects of rearing temperature or they may be mediated by the correlated changes in cell size. Notably, our results are consistent with the idea that a smaller cell size may confer tolerance to acute temperatures via enhanced oxygen supply, while a larger cell may confer greater tolerance to chronic and less intense heat stress via more efficient use of resources.",2019,"Nadja Verspagen, FÃ©lix P Leiva, Irene M Janssen, Wilco C E P Verberk, Nadja Verspagen, FÃ©lix P Leiva, Irene M Janssen, Wilco C E P Verberk"

Turning food into eggs: insights from nutritional biology and developmental physiology of Drosophila,31109673,10.1016/j.cois.2018.08.006,"Nutrition plays a central role in fecundity, regulating the onset of reproductive maturity, egg production, and the survival and health of offspring from insects to humans. Although decades of research have worked to uncover how nutrition mediates these effects, it has proven difficult to disentangle the relative role of nutrients as the raw material for egg and offspring development versus their role in stimulating endocrine cascades necessary to drive development. This has been further complicated by the fact that both nutrients and the signalling cascades they regulate interact in complex ways to control fecundity. Separating the two effects becomes important when trying to understand how fecundity is regulated, and in devising strategies to offset the negative effects of nutrition on reproductive health. In this review, we use the extensive literature on egg development in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to explore how the nutrients from food provide the building blocks and stimulate signalling cascades necessary for making an egg.",2019,"Christen K Mirth, AndrÃ© Nogueira Alves, Matthew Dw Piper, Christen K Mirth, AndrÃ© Nogueira Alves, Matthew Dw Piper"
Oxidative stress resistance as a factor in aging: evidence from an extended longevity phenotype of Drosophila melanogaster,31054025,10.1007/s10522-019-09812-7,"Longevity of a species is a multifactorial quantitative trait influenced by genetic background, sex, age and environment of the organism. Extended longevity phenotypes (ELP) from experimental evolution in the laboratory can be used as model systems to investigate the mechanisms underlying aging and senescence. ELPs of Drosophila are correlated with various life history attributes such as resistance to environmental stressors (starvation, desiccation, cold and paraquat), developmental time, biochemical defenses, etc. The association between oxidative stress resistance and longevity is not clear and ELPs offer an opportunity to examine the role of oxidative stress resistance in longevity. Here, we have investigated the hypothesis that enhanced oxidative stress resistance and elevated antioxidant defense system play a positive role in longevity using an ELP of Drosophila melanogaster. An ELP of D. melanogaster isolated and characterized in our laboratory through artificial selection (inbred laboratory strain of Oregon K) is employed in this study. Our ELP, named as long lifespan (LLS) flies, shows marked extension in lifespan when compared to the progenitor population (normal lifespan, NLS) and makes a suitable model to study the role of mitochondrial genome in longevity because of its least heterogeneity. In this study, sensitivity to ethanol with age was employed as a measure of resistance to oxidative stress in NLS and LLS flies. Effect of age and oxidative stress on longevity was examined by employing NLS and LLS flies of different age groups against ethanol-induced oxidative stress. Results show that the lower mortality against ethanol was associated with enhanced oxidative stress resistance, higher antioxidant defenses, lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, enhanced alcohol dehydrogenase activity and better locomotor ability attributes of LLS flies. In addition, age-related changes like locomotor impairments, decreased antioxidant defenses, higher ROS levels and sensitivity to oxidative stress were delayed in LLS flies when compared to NLS. Our study supports the hypothesis that higher oxidative stress resistance and enhanced antioxidant defenses are significant factors in extending longevity.",2019,"S Deepashree, S Niveditha, T Shivanandappa, S R Ramesh, S Deepashree, S Niveditha, T Shivanandappa, S R Ramesh"

In the natural environment, Drosophila melanogaster, increasingly used as a model to study neuronal circuits and behaviour, spend their lives surrounded by several conspecifics of different stages, as well as heterospecifics. Despite their dynamic multi-organism natural environment, the neuronal basis of social behaviours has been typically studied in dyadic interactions, such as mating or aggression. This review will focus on recent studies regarding how the behaviour of fruit flies can be shaped by the nature of the surrounding group.

Functional relevance of genes predicted to be affected by epigenetic alterations in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors,30446899,10.1007/s11060-018-03018-6,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) is a highly malignant brain tumor predominantly arising in infants. Mutations of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex members SMARCB1/INI1 or (rarely) SMARCA4/Brg1 are the sole recurrent genetic lesions. Epigenetic studies revealed a large number of genes predicted to be affected by differential histone modifications in ATRT, but the role of these genes in the biology of ATRT remains uncertain. We therefore aimed at exploring the role of these genes in the detrimental effects of SMARCB1-deficiency.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      The functional relevance of 1083 genes predicted to be affected by epigenetic alterations in ATRT was examined in vivo using a Drosophila melanogaster model of SMARCB1-deficiency. Human orthologues of genes whose knockdown modified the phenotype in the Gal4-UAS fly model were further examined in ATRT samples and SMARCB1-deficient rhabdoid tumor cells.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Knockdown of Snr1, the fly orthologue of SMARCB1, resulted in a lethal phenotype and epigenetic alterations in the fly model. The lethal phenotype was shifted to later stages of development upon additional siRNA knockdown of 89 of 1083 genes screened in vivo. These included TGF-beta receptor signaling pathway related genes, e.g. CG10348, the fly orthologue of transcriptional regulator PRDM16. Subsequently, PRDM16 was found to be over-expressed in ATRT samples and knockdown of PRDM16 in SMARCB1-deficient rhabdoid tumor cells reduced proliferation.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:

While previous studies have identified network components important for patterning the larval genital disc, the networks governing adult structures during pupal development have remained uncharted. Here, we performed RNA-seq in whole Drosophila melanogaster male terminalia followed by in situ hybridization for 100 highly expressed transcription factors during pupal development. We find that the male terminalia are highly patterned during pupal stages and that specific transcription factors mark separate structures and substructures.

Gut yeasts do not improve desiccation survival in Drosophila melanogaster,31170408,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2019.103893,"A healthy gut microbiota generally improves the performance of its insect host. Although the effects can be specific to the species composition of the microbial community, the role of gut microbiota in determining water balance has not been well explored. We used axenic and gnotobiotic (reared with a known microbiota) Drosophila melanogaster to test three hypotheses about the effects of gut yeasts on the water balance of adult flies: 1) that gut yeasts would improve desiccation survival in adult flies; 2) that larval yeasts would improve adult desiccation survival; 3) that the effects would be species-specific, such that yeasts closely associated with D. melanogaster in nature are more likely to be beneficial than those rarely found in association with D. melanogaster. We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae (often used in Drosophila cultures, but rarely associated with D. melanogaster in nature), Lachancea kluyveri (associated with some species of Drosophila, but not D. melanogaster), and Pichia kluyveri (associated with D. melanogaster in nature). Adult inoculation with yeasts had no effect on survival of desiccating conditions. Inoculation with P. kluyveri as larvae did not change desiccation survival in adults; however, rearing with L. kluyveri or S. cerevisiae reduced adult desiccation survival. We conclude that adult inoculation with gut yeasts has no impact on desiccation survival, but that rearing with yeasts can have either no or detrimental effect. The effects appear to be species-specific: P. kluyveri did not have a negative impact on desiccation tolerance, suggesting some level of co-adaptation with D. melanogaster.

An infection of Enterobacter ludwigii affects development and causes age-dependent neurodegeneration in Drosophila melanogaster,31641932,10.1007/s10158-019-0233-y,"The effects of teeth-blackening bacteria Enterobacter ludwigii on the physiological system were investigated using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. The bacteria were mixed with the fly food, and its effect was checked on the growth, development and behaviour of Drosophila. Microbes generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the haemolymph of the larvae once it enters into the body. The increased amount of ROS was evidenced by the NBT assay and using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate dye, which indicates the mitochondrial ROS. The increased amount of ROS resulted in a number of abnormal nuclei within the gut. Besides that larvae walking became sluggish in comparison with wild type although the larvae crawling path did not change much. Flies hatched from the infectious larvae have the posterior scutellar bristle absent from the thorax and abnormal mechanosensory hairs in the eye, and they undergo time-dependent neurodegeneration as evidenced by the geotrophic and phototrophic assays. To decipher the mechanism of neurodegeneration, flies were checked for the presence of four important bioamines: tyramine, cadaverine, putrescine and histamine. Out of these four, histamine was found to be absent in infected flies. Histamine is a key molecule required for the functioning of the photoreceptor as well as mechanoreceptors.

"Waveform Plasticity under Entrainment to 12-h T-cycles in Drosophila melanogaster: Behavior, Neuronal Network, and Evolution",31994435,10.1177/0748730419899549,"A crucial property of circadian clocks is the ability to regulate the shape of an oscillation over its cycle length (waveform) appropriately, thus enhancing Darwinian fitness. Many studies over the past decade have revealed interesting ways in which the waveform of rodent behavior could be manipulated, one of which is that the activity bout bifurcates under environments that have 2 light/dark cycles within one 24-h day (LDLD). It has been observed that such unique, although unnatural, environments reveal acute changes in the circadian clock network. However, although adaptation of waveforms to different photoperiods is well studied, modulation of waveforms under LDLD has received relatively less attention in research on insect rhythms. Therefore, we undertook this study to ask the following questions: what is the extent of waveform plasticity that Drosophila melanogaster exhibits, and what are the neuronal underpinnings of such plasticity under LDLD? We found that the activity/rest rhythms of wild-type flies do not bifurcate under LDLD. Instead, they show similar but significantly different behavior from that under a long-day LD cycle. This behavior is accompanied by differences in the organization of the circadian neuronal network, which include changes in waveforms of a core clock component and an output molecule. In addition, to understand the functional significance of such variations in the waveform, we examined laboratory selected populations that exhibit divergent eclosion chronotypes (and therefore, waveforms). We found that populations selected for predominant eclosion in an evening window (late chronotypes) showed reduced amplitude plasticity and increased phase plasticity of activity/rest rhythms. This, we argue, is reflective of divergent evolution of circadian neuronal network organization in our laboratory selected flies.",2020,"Lakshman Abhilash, Aishwarya Ramakrishnan, Srishti Priya, Vasu Sheeba, Lakshman Abhilash, Aishwarya Ramakrishnan, Srishti Priya, Vasu Sheeba"
Nanopore sequencing and Hi-C scaffolding provide insight into the evolutionary dynamics of transposable elements and piRNA production in wild strains of Drosophila melanogaster,31754714,10.1093/nar/gkz1080,"Illumina sequencing has allowed for population-level surveys of transposable element (TE) polymorphism via split alignment approaches, which has provided important insight into the population dynamics of TEs. However, such approaches are not able to identify insertions of uncharacterized TEs, nor can they assemble the full sequence of inserted elements. Here, we use nanopore sequencing and Hi-C scaffolding to produce de novo genome assemblies for two wild strains of Drosophila melanogaster from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). Ovarian piRNA populations and Illumina split-read TE insertion profiles have been previously produced for both strains. We find that nanopore sequencing with Hi-C scaffolding produces highly contiguous, chromosome-length scaffolds, and we identify hundreds of TE insertions that were missed by Illumina-based methods, including a novel micropia-like element that has recently invaded the DGRP population. We also find hundreds of piRNA-producing loci that are specific to each strain. Some of these loci are created by strain-specific TE insertions, while others appear to be epigenetically controlled. Our results suggest that Illumina approaches reveal only a portion of the repetitive sequence landscape of eukaryotic genomes and that population-level resequencing using long reads is likely to provide novel insight into the evolutionary dynamics of repetitive elements.",2020,"Christopher E Ellison, Weihuan Cao, Christopher E Ellison, Weihuan Cao"

To validate the role of these genes in immune defense, their expression was knocked-down using RNAi and survival of infected hosts was followed, which confirmed a role for the genes krishah and S6k in immune defense. We further identified a putative role for the Bomanin gene BomBc1 (also known as IM23), in E. faecalis infection response. This study adds to the growing set of association studies for infection in Drosophila melanogaster and suggests that the genetic causes of variation in immune defense differ for different pathogens.",2020,"Joanne R Chapman, Maureen A Dowell, Rosanna Chan, Robert L Unckless, Joanne R Chapman, Maureen A Dowell, Rosanna Chan, Robert L Unckless"
Chromosomal substitution analysis of receptivity and sexual isolation in Drosophila melanogaster females,7591836,10.1038/hdy.1995.170,"A chromosome substitution analysis was carried out in Drosophila melanogaster to elucidate the contribution of the X, II and III chromosomes to female receptivity, and to sexual isolation with its sibling species D. simulans. Two lines from the same base population with extreme phenotypes, the one showing high receptivity and weak isolation and the other showing low receptivity and strong isolation, were used. Genes involved in receptivity were located in chromosome III whereas those affecting sexual isolation were located in all the three chromosomes. These results indicate that the direct relationship between female receptivity and sexual isolation previously detected in D. melanogaster could be because of the occurrence of genes common to the two traits in the chromosome III.",1995,"M C Carracedo, R PiÃ±eiro, P Casares"
Flight initiations in Drosophila melanogaster are mediated by several distinct motor patterns,7707271,10.1007/BF00219061,"We have monitored the patterns of activation of five muscles during flight initiation of Drosophila melanogaster: the tergotrochanteral muscle (a mesothoracic leg extensor), dorsal longitudinal muscles #3, #4 and #6 (wing depressors), and dorsal ventral muscle #Ic (a wing elevator). Stimulation of a pair of large descending interneurons, the giant fibers, activates these muscles in a stereotypic pattern and is thought to evoke escape flight initiation. To investigate the role of the giant fibers in coordinating flight initiation, we have compared the patterns of muscle activation evoked by giant fiber stimulation with those during flight initiations executed voluntarily and evoked by visual and olfactory stimuli. Visually elicited flight initiations exhibit patterns of muscle activation indistinguishable from those evoked by giant fiber stimulation. Olfactory-induced flight initiations exhibit patterns of muscle activation similar to those during voluntary flight initiations. Yet only some benzaldehyde-induced and voluntary flight initiations exhibit patterns of muscle activation similar to those evoked by giant fiber stimulation. These results indicate that visually elicited flight initiations are coordinated by the giant fiber circuit. By contrast, the giant fiber circuit alone cannot account for the patterns of muscle activation observed during the majority of olfactory-induced and voluntary flight initiations.",1995,"J R Trimarchi, A M Schneiderman, J R Trimarchi, A M Schneiderman"
Comparison of ecdysteroid production in Drosophila and Manduca: pharmacology and cross-species neural reactivity,7579574,10.1002/arch.940300212,"In both Manduca sexta and Drosophila melanogaster, metamorphic events are driven by ecdysteroids whose production in prothoracic gland (PGs) is stimulated periodically by neural factors. Differences in the life cycle of moths and flies have made it difficult to compare the regulation of ecdysteroid biosynthesis in these two species. As in Manduca, at least two neural factors in the larval Drosophila BVG complex were separable by molecular weight, and they stimulated increased ecdysteroid biosynthesis from the ring gland, a composite organ that includes PG cells. Drosophila neural extracts accelerated ecdysteroid biosynthesis in Manduca PGs and, conversely, partially purified Manduca PTTH preparations elevated ecdysteroid biosynthesis in Drosophila ring glands, suggesting that the two species may share structurally similar prothoracicotropic factors. Drosophila ring glands required the presence of calcium ions to respond to neural extracts, but the phosphodiesterase inhibitor MIX and cAMP analogues exerted little, if any, positive effect on production. Mean ecdysteroid production rates of BVG-ring gland complexes taken from Drosophila larvae during various phases of the wandering period were often submaximal and highly variable, suggesting that they fluctuate widely prior to pupariation. Based on available data in Drosophila and the Manduca model for the control of ecdysteroid biosynthesis, a developmental scheme for neuroendocrine control in Drosophila is proposed.",1995,"V C Henrich, V C Henrich"
Novel Drosophila melanogaster genes encoding RRM-type RNA-binding proteins identified by a degenerate PCR strategy,7890163,10.1016/0378-1119(94)00840-o,"We are interested in identifying Drosophila melanogaster RNA-binding proteins involved in important developmental decisions made at the level of mRNA processing, stability, localization or translational control. A large subset of the proteins known to interact with specific RNA sequences shares an evolutionarily conserved 80-90-amino-acid (aa) domain referred to as an RNA-recognition motif (RRM), including two ribonucleoprotein identifier sequences known as RNP-1 and RNP-2. Hence, we have herein applied degenerate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology to clone three additional members (termed rox2, rox8 and rox21) of the D. melanogaster RRM-protein gene superfamily encoding putative trans-acting regulatory factors. Representative cDNA clones were isolated, the conceptual aa sequences of the candidate Rox proteins were inferred from their nucleotide sequences, and database searches were conducted. Rox2 displays extensive aa sequence similarities to putative RNA-binding proteins encoded by the genomes of the plants Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana; Rox21 resembles essential metazoan pre-mRNA splicing factors; as described elsewhere, Rox8 is likely a fly homolog of the two human TIA-1-type nucleolysins [Brand and Bourbon, Nucleic Acids Res. 21 (1993) 3699-3704].",1995,"S F Brand, S Pichoff, S Noselli, H M Bourbon, S F Brand, S Pichoff, S Noselli, H M Bourbon"
Identification of two Drosophila TGF-beta family members in the grasshopper Schistocerca americana,7666445,10.1007/BF00170667,"Intercellular signaling molecules of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily are required for pattern formation in many multicellular organisms. The decapentaplegic (dpp) gene of Drosophila melanogaster has several developmental roles. To improve our understanding of the evolutionary diversification of this large family we identified dpp in the grasshopper Schistocerca americana. S. americana diverged from D. melanogaster approximately 350 million years ago, utilizes a distinct developmental program, and has a 60-fold-larger genome than D. melanogaster. Our analyses indicate a single dpp locus in D. melanogaster and S. americana, suggesting that dpp copy number does not correlate with increasing genome size. Another TGF-beta superfamily member, the D. melanogaster gene 60A, is also present in only one copy in each species. Comparison of homologous sequences from D. melanogaster, S. americana, and H. sapiens, representing roughly 900 million years of evolutionary distance, reveals significant constraint on sequence divergence for both dpp and 60A. In the signaling portion of the dpp protein, the amino acid identity between these species exceeds 74%. Our results for the TGF-beta superfamily are consistent with current hypotheses describing gene duplication and diversification as a frequent response to high levels of selective pressure on individual family members.",1995,"S J Newfeld, W M Gelbart, S J Newfeld, W M Gelbart"
Antibodies directed against microtubule proteins from Drosophila melanogaster cross react with similar proteins in the rat brain,8925298,10.1016/0006-8993(95)00953-x,"Monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) were used to delineate the localization of three proteins in rat cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. The proteins were identified by Mabs directed against Drosophila melanogaster microtubule proteins (MTP). We have provisionally designated these proteins as Drosophila microtubule-associated proteins (DMAPs). The corresponding monoclonal antibodies are designated Mab DMAP-45, -55 and -66 indicating the molecular weights of each protein. All three Mabs cross-react with proteins of similar molecular weights in the rat brain. Correspondingly, these rat proteins are designated DMAPRs. DMAP-45 binds microtubules in an ATP-dependent manner. The molecular weight and subcellular localization of DMAP-45R differs significantly from previously described mammalian brain MAPs suggesting that it represents a novel MAP. Biochemical evidence suggests it may be an actin-related protein. DMAP-55R co-purifies stoichiometrically with rat brain microtubules and appears to be a previously undescribed isoform of tubulin. DMAP-66, which co-purifies stoichiometrically with Drosophila microtubules, does not do so in the rat brain. Immunohistochemistry performed with all three Mabs revealed a general pattern of staining of cell somata and dendrites in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. Mab DMAP-55 also stained axons. In cerebral cortex all three Mabs preferentially, but not exclusively, stained layer V neuronal somata and dendrites. In hippocampus, Mabs DMAP-45 and -66 stained cell somata and dendrites in all hippocampal subfields, particularly the subiculum and CA3, whereas Mab DMAP-55 was most prevalent in mossy fibers. All three Mabs stain Purkinje cells in cerebellum with additional staining of cerebellar basket cells and Golgi cells observed with Mab DMAP-66.",1995,"A A Alcantara, S Srinivasan, A R Reilein, T L Karr, A A Alcantara, S Srinivasan, A R Reilein, T L Karr"
Probing the evolution of senescence in Drosophila melanogaster with P-element tagging,8522162,10.1007/BF01439576,"Natural populations host a wealth of genetic variation in longevity and age-specific schedules of reproduction. This variation provides critical information for inferring the evolutionary origin of senescence. Patterns of mutational effects on age-specific fecundity and survival provide additional insight to distinguish alternative models of senescence. In this study, P-elements bearing the white minigene were inserted at random into a common genetic background, generating lines of D. melanogaster with single, stable transposon inserts. A series of 48 single-P-element lines revealed statistically significant heterogeneity in both longevity and fecundity. Longevity and early fecundity were only weakly positively correlated (r = 0.286, P = 0.0398). Both the pooled sample and 30 of the individual lines exhibited a leveling of age-specific mortality at advanced ages, in opposition to the classical demographic models. To the extent that these mutational effects are representative of naturally-occurring mutations in heterogeneous populations, this result presents a problem for the evolutionary theory of senescence. Natural selection is inefficient at removing deleterious mutations that are expressed only at late ages, and selection may not differentiate between mutations whose effects on longevity are post-reproductive. A leveling of the mortality rate would also be seen if mutations whose expression is delayed until very late simply do not occur. A simulation of mutation-selection balance among the 48 P-element tagged lines shows that the mean longevity declines monotonically with increasing mutation rate, consistent with the mutation-accumulation model.",1995,"A G Clark, R N Guadalupe, A G Clark, R N Guadalupe"

White as a reporter gene to detect transcriptional silencers specifying position-specific gene expression during Drosophila melanogaster eye development,8582614,,"The white+ gene was used as a reporter to detect transcriptional silencer activity in the Drosophila genome. Changes in the spatial expression pattern of white were scored in the adult eye as nonuniform patterns of pigmentation. Thirty-six independent P[lacW] transposant lines were collected. These represent 12 distinct pigmentation patterns and probably 21 loci. The spatial pigmentation pattern is due to cis-acting suppression of white+ expression, and the suppression probably depends on cell position rather than cell type. The mechanism of suppression differs from inactivation by heterochromatin. In addition, activation of lacZ in P[lacW] occurs also in specific patterns in imaginal discs and embryos in many of the lines. The expression patterns of white+ and lacZ may reflect the activity of regulatory elements belonging to an endogenous gene near each P[lacW] insertion site. We speculate that these putative POSE (position-specific expression) genes may have a role in pattern formation of the eye as well as other imaginal structures. Three of the loci identified are optomotor-blind, engrailed and invected. teashirt is also implicated as a candidate gene.

A putative digestive cysteine proteinase from Drosophila melanogaster is predominantly expressed in the embryonic and larval midgut,7851441,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.tb20428.x,"Plant seeds have biodefense systems for protection against insects. One of these systems may be based on the occurrence of phytocystatins, cysteine proteinase inhibitors of plant origin, that probably inhibit insect cysteine proteinases involved in digestive functions. To elucidate a molecular mechanism for this biodefense phenomenon, we isolated a gene encoding a putative digestive cysteine proteinase from Drosophila melanogaster, a suitable model species. The cloned genomic DNA fragment contained a sequence encoding a cysteine proteinase. The mature enzyme from the encoded protein, termed Drosophila cysteine proteinase-1, consisted of 218 amino acid residues. Drosophila cysteine proteinase-1 showed 67% similarity in its amino acid sequence to a lobster cysteine proteinase-3 contained in the digestive juice. This enzyme also showed significant similarities to cysteine proteinases of animal origin such as cathepsins H and L, and to proteinases of plant origin such as rice oryzains alpha and beta. In situ hybridization studies for the embryo showed that the mRNA for Drosophila cysteine proteinase-1 was predominantly expressed in the midgut. Larval alimentary organs, such as the salivary gland and the midgut including the gastric caeca, also expressed the mRNA at significant levels. These observations, suggesting that Drosophila cysteine proteinase-1 is a digestive cysteine proteinase which can be used as a model target of phytocystatins, will hopefully lead to new strategies for the regulation of pest insects.",1995,"I Matsumoto, H Watanabe, K Abe, S Arai, Y Emori, I Matsumoto, H Watanabe, K Abe, S Arai, Y Emori"
Selection for increased female sexual receptivity in raised stocks of Drosophila melanogaster,7575359,10.1007/BF02197279,"Two third-chromosome mutations in raised (rsd) stocks, when homozygous, cause the wings of Drosophila melanogaster adults to be held upright. Males expressing these mutations cannot vibrate their wings to produce the courtship song, which functions to increase female receptivity to copulation. As expected, rsd males are less successful when courting wild-type females. However, females from long-established rsd stocks are more receptive to courtship stimuli and mate more readily with both rsd and wild-type males than do wild-type females. Genetic analysis reveals dominant factors on the X and third chromosomes that, in combination, are responsible for the increased receptivity of rsd females. These observations suggest that the lack of courtship song in rsd stocks, which would be expected to reduce the vigor of the stock, may have functioned as a selective force, favoring mutations that increased female receptivity. Possible consequences of selection favoring the development of differential female receptivity on speciation are discussed.",1995,"S P McRobert, F B Schnee, L Tompkins, S P McRobert, F B Schnee, L Tompkins"
Physiological genetics of the response to a high-sucrose diet by Drosophila melanogaster,7575391,10.1007/BF00554727,"A diet medium containing 10% (w/v) sucrose can be inferred to be stressful to Drosophila melanogaster from the increased developmental time and reduced size and fecundity of emerging flies. The metabolic basis for this stress and the genetic response to it are of interest from the point of view of both metabolic regulation and the evolutionary genetics of adaptation to stress. Here the effects of a high-sucrose diet on live weight, total protein, stored lipid and glycogen, and crude activities of 12 enzymes involved in energy metabolism were quantified. Assays were done on a large population of Drosophila that had been acclimated to the laboratory. A collection of eggs was divided to produce two replicate populations maintained on standard medium and two replicates maintained on high-sucrose medium for 133 generations. At the end of this period, both control and sucrose-selected populations were tested on standard and on high-sucrose medium. Results showed that the immediate effect of the high-sucrose diet (compared to standard medium) for both populations was a reduction in live weight and total protein, and activities of many of the enzymes were also reduced by the sucrose treatment, even after adjusting for the weight effect. Selection resulted in several changes on both the standard and the sucrose medium, but the direction of change was not always the same as the acute effect. In no case was there a significant medium by selection-treatment interaction. The pattern of phenotypic correlations did not resolve the reasons for the direction of the genetic responses. Correlations were generally stable across diets and after selection, but there were notable exceptions.",1995,"L Wang, A G Clark, L Wang, A G Clark"

The consensus emerging from the application of all approaches is that much of the mutational and segregating variation affecting bristle number is attributable to alleles with large phenotype effects at a small number of candidate loci.",1995,"T F Mackay, T F Mackay"
Cellular expression of the Drosophila melanogaster FMRFamide neuropeptide gene product DPKQDFMRFamide. Evidence for differential processing of the FMRFamide polypeptide precursor,8562315,10.1007/BF02736754,"DPKQDFMRFamide is one of five different FMRFamide-containing peptides encoded in the Drosophila FMRFamide gene. To study the cellular expression of DPKQDFMRFamide, we have generated antisera to DPKQD, the N-terminal sequence of the peptide, to avoid crossreactivity with other -FMRFamide-containing peptides. The antisera were purified and the specificity characterized. DPKQDFMRFamide immunoreactive material is first observed in the embryonic central nervous system (CNS) in one cell of the subesophageal ganglion and one cell in each of the three thoracic ganglia. This pattern of expression is observed in larval, pupal, and adult neural tissue, albeit with increased signal intensity. In larva, pupa, and adult, additional cells in the superior protocerebrum, a thoracic ganglion, and an abdominal ganglion express DPKQDFMRFamide immunoreactive material. Immunoreactivity is observed in a cell in the lateral protocerebrum of pupa and adult and cells in the optic lobe of adult. No immunoreactive material was observed in gut tissue. DPKQDFMRFamide antisera stain a subset of cells previously identified by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to express the FMRFamide transcript and polypeptide precursor.

The realized heritabilities (h2 ) ranged from 0.20 to 0.30 for the fast lines and 0.35 to 0.60 for the slow lines. The selection applied is relevant in relation to the evolution of aging. The longevity of adults, either virgin or mated, was not affected by selection for developmental time, indicating that developmental time is not a causal determinant of life span, thus confirming the results of the studies on environmental effects on aging (Zwaan et al. 1991, 1992). However, adult body weights were higher in the slow developmental lines and lower in the fast lines, relative to the control flies. Furthermore, slow females showed relatively high early fecundity and low late fecundity, as compared with control and fast females. Mated longevities and total lifetime progeny productions were not statistically different. Previous results obtained by other authors from selection experiments on age at reproduction either supported the mutation accumulation or the negative pleiotropy theory of aging (Luckinbill et al. 1984; Rose 1984b).

Each lectin gave a specific pattern of binding. The extent of binding of Con A, WGA, s-WGA, and GSA-I A4 over the acrosomal region was greater than over nonacrosomal regions, indicating the concentration of alpha-mannose/alpha-glucose, beta-N-acetylglucosamine, and alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine residues in this area of the plasma membrane. The surface of the sperm failed to react with lectins from Ricinus communis (RCA-I), Limulus polyphemus (LPA), and Limax flavus (LFA) and with the B4 isoform of agglutinin-I from Griffonia simplicifolia-I (GSA-I B4). The plasma membrane over the nucleus did not react with any of the lectins tested. Quantitative analysis of binding of Con A, s-WGA, and GSA-I A4 to spermatozoa showed that only Con A bound consistently to the sperm surface, showing high affinity for the acrosomal area of the plasma membrane.

[The role of quinine chlorhydrate in the conditioned inhibition of the tarsal reflex in Drosophila melanogaster],9221057,10.1037/1196-1961.49.4.520,"The proboscis extension reflex (PER) can be elicited by applying a sucrose stimulation to the tarsus of a walking fly. This reflex decreases in frequency with repetition, presumably habituation, a nonassociative learning. If each sucrose stimulation is followed by a bitter stimulation, quinine chloride, the PER declines more rapidly, probably the result of conditioning, an associative learning. The present work shows that quinine chloride does not always inhibit PER suppressions but depends on the moment of delivery, being most effective when presented immediately after a sucrose stimulation. A bitter stimulus presented before, or simultaneously with a sucrose stimulation is less effective than habituation to sucrose alone. This experiment provides evidence for an interpretation in terms of cognitive association. The model of learning is not a Pavlovian conditioning as advanced by Medioni and Vaysse (1975), but corresponds to the punishment paradigm of Dyal and Corning (1973).",1995,"A Bouhouche, A Elkhessaimi, G Vaysse, M K Choulli, A Bouhouche, A Elkhessaimi, G Vaysse, M K Choulli"

We focused on the central nervous system (CNS) and on the innervation of the larval body wall muscles. The larval octopamine neuronal pattern was composed of prominent neurons along the midline of the ventral ganglion, whereas brain lobes were devoid of immunoreactive somata. However, intense immunoreactive neuropil was observed both in the ventral ganglion and in the brain lobes. Some of the immunoreactive neurons sent peripheral fibers that innervated most of the muscles of the larval body wall. Octopamine immunoreactivity was observed at neuromuscular junctions in all larval stages, being present in a well-defined subset of synaptic boutons, type II. Octopamine immunoreactivity in the adult CNS revealed many additional neurons compared to the larval CNS, indicating that at least a subset of adult octopamine neurons may differentiate during metamorphosis.

To provide alternative Mos1 helper plasmids for transformation experiments, two types of Mos1-promoter fusions were constructed: hsp-70:Mos1 and hsp26-Sgs3:Mos1. The former has the Mos1 coding region driven by the hsp70 heat-shock promoter; the latter has it driven by the basal Sgs3 promoter under the control of the hsp26 female-germline specific transcriptional regulator. When introduced into D. melanogaster by P-element-mediated germline transformation, these elements are unable to transpose or excise in the presence of autonomous Mos1-related elements (they are ""marooned"") because the 5' inverted repeat of Mos1 is missing. As expected, the hsp26-Sgs3:Mos1 fusions exhibit a significantly greater rate of germline excision of a target mariner element than do the hsp70:Mos1 fusions. Unexpectedly, the rate of excision of target mariner elements induced by hsp26-Sgs3:Mos1 is the same in the male germline as in the female germline. Both hsp:Mos1 fusions show strong germline expression and a maternal effect of the mariner transposase. A significant grand-maternal effect of the hsp:Mos1 fusions was also detected as a result of a maternal effect on the germline of the F1 progeny. Among flies carrying the promoter fusions inherited maternally, about three-quarters of the overall rate of germline excision derives from the direct genotypic effect and about one-quarter results from the grand-maternal effect. Despite the strong somatic expression of the hsp:Mos1 fusions, mariner transformants carrying a white+ reporter gene at the SacI site remained stable in the soma.",1995,"A R Lohe, D A Lidholm, D L Hartl, A R Lohe, D A Lidholm, D L Hartl"
Temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis as a screening tool for polymorphisms in multigene families,7588551,10.1002/elps.11501601117,"Information about sequence variability between different copies of a multigene family is indispensable for understanding the evolutionary mechanisms acting on multigene families. However, their high copy number has been a major obstacle to systematic analysis. Exemplified by the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) of the rDNA in Drosophila melanogaster, it is shown how temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) can be used to study sequence polymorphisms in a multigene family.

Structure and expression of histone H3.3 genes in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila hydei,7557364,10.1139/g95-075,"We demonstrate that in Drosophila melanogaster the histone H3.3 replacement variant is encoded by two genes, H3.3A and H3.3B. We have isolated cDNA clones for H3.3A and cDNA and genomic clones for H3.3B. The genes encode exactly the same protein but are widely divergent in their untranslated regions (UTR). Both genes are expressed in embryos and adults; they are expressed in the gonads as well as in somatic tissues of the flies. However, only one of them, H3.3A, shows strong testes expression. The 3' UTR of the H3.3A gene is relatively short (approximately 250 nucleotides (nt)). H3.3B transcripts can be processed at several polyadenylation sites, the longest with a 3' UTR of more than 1500 nt. The 3' processing sites, preferentially used in the gonads and somatic tissues, are different. We have also isolated the Drosophila hydei homologues of the two H3.3 genes. They are quite similar to the D. melanogaster genes in their expression patterns. However, in contrast to their vertebrate counterparts, which are highly conserved in their noncoding regions, the Drosophila genes display only limited sequence similarity in these regions.",1995,"A S Akhmanova, P C Bindels, J Xu, K Miedema, H Kremer, W Hennig, A S Akhmanova, P C Bindels, J Xu, K Miedema, H Kremer, W Hennig"
Novel DNA binding proteins highly specific to UV-damaged DNA sequences from embryos of Drosophila melanogaster,7651820,10.1093/nar/23.14.2600,"Three new proteins which selectively bind to UV-damaged DNA were identified and purified to near homogeneity from UV-irradiated Drosophila melanogaster embryos through several column chromatographies. These proteins, tentatively designated as D-DDB P1, P2 and P3, can be identified as different complex bands in a gel shift assay by using UV-irradiated TC-31 probe DNA. Analysis of the purified D-DDB P1 fraction by native or SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and FPLC-Superose 6 gel filtration demonstrated that it is a monomer protein which is a 30 kDa polypeptide. The D-DDB P2 protein is a monopolypeptide with a molecular mass of 14 kDa. Both D-DDB P1 and P2 highly prefer binding to UV-irradiated DNA, and have almost no affinity for non-irradiated DNA. Gel shift assays with either UV-irradiated DNA probes demonstrated that D-DDB P1 may show a preference for binding to (6-4) photoproducts, while D-DDB P2 may prefer binding to pyrimidine dimers. Both these proteins require magnesium ions for binding. D-DDB P1 is an ATP-preferent protein. These findings are discussed in relation to two recently described [Todo and Ryo (1991) Mutat. Res., 273, 85-93; Todo et al. (1993) Nature, 361, 371-374] DNA-binding factors from Drosophila cell extracts.

A primordial dopamine D1-like adenylyl cyclase-linked receptor from Drosophila melanogaster displaying poor affinity for benzazepines,7720859,10.1016/0014-5793(95)00224-w,"We report here the isolation from Drosophila melanogaster of a 2.0 kb cDNA clone encoding a 385 amino acid protein (dDA1) displaying, within putative transmembrane domains, highest amino acid sequence homology (49-53%) to members of the vertebrate dopamine D1-like receptor family. When expressed in either Sf9 or COS-7 cells, dDA1 did not bind the specific D1-like receptor antagonist [3H]SCH-23390 or numerous other dopaminergic, adrenergic or serotoninergic ligands with high affinity. However, like vertebrate dopamine D1-like receptors, dDA1 stimulated the accumulation of cAMP in response to DA (EC50 approximately 300 nM) and 6,7-ADTN (EC50 approximately 500 nM). The dopaminergic rank order of potency (DA > NE >> 5-HT) and the lack of stimulation by other possible neurotransmitters (octopamine, tyramine, tryptamine) or DA metabolites (e.g. N-acetyl dopamine) found in Drosophila suggests that this receptor functionally belongs to the dopamine D1-like subfamily. Benzazepines, which characteristically bind to vertebrate dopamine D1-like receptors with high affinity, were relatively poor in stimulating (SKF-38393, SKF-82526; EC50 > 10 microM) dDA1-mediated accumulation of cAMP. Of the numerous compounds tested, a few dopaminergic antagonists inhibited DA-stimulated production of cAMP in a concentration-dependent manner, albeit with considerably reduced affinity, and with the rank order of potency: (+)-butaclamol(Kb approximately 125nM) > SCH-23390(Kb approximately 230nM) > alpha-flupenthixol (Kb approximately 400 nM) > chlorpromazine > or = spiperone (Kb approximately 680 nM) > or = clozapine. In situ hybridization revealed that dDA1 receptor mRNA is expressed as a maternal transcript, and at later blastoderm stages is restricted to apical regions of the cortical peripheral cytoplasm. The generation of inter-species D1 receptor chimeras may help to identify those particular sequence-specific motifs or amino acid residues conferring high affinity benzaepine receptor interactions.",1995,"K S Sugamori, L L Demchyshyn, F McConkey, M A Forte, H B Niznik, K S Sugamori, L L Demchyshyn, F McConkey, M A Forte, H B Niznik"
Drosophila melanogaster mitochondrial DNA: completion of the nucleotide sequence and evolutionary comparisons,8825764,10.1111/j.1365-2583.1995.tb00032.x,"The nucleotide sequence of the regions flanking the A+T region of Drosophila melanogaster mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been determined. Included are the genes encoding the transfer RNAs for valine, isoleucine, glutamine and methionine, the small ribosomal RNA and the 5'-coding sequences of the large ribosomal RNA and NADH dehydrogenase subunit II. This completes the nucleotide sequence of the D. melanogaster mitochondrial genome. The circular mtDNA of D. melanogaster varies in size among different populations largely due to length differences in the control region (Fauron & Wolstenholme, 1976; Fauron & Wolstenholme, 1980a, b); the mtDNA region we have sequenced, combined with those sequenced by others, yields a composite genome that is 19,517 bp in length as compared to 16,019 bp for the mtDNA of D. yakuba. D. melanogaster mtDNA exhibits an extreme bias in base composition; it comprises 82.2% deoxyadenylate and thymidylate residues as compared to 78.6% in D. yakuba mtDNA. All genes encoded in the mtDNA of both species are in identical locations and orientations.

Monitoring development and pathology of Drosophila indirect flight muscles using green fluorescent protein,7781915,10.1006/dbio.1995.1186,"We describe the use of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter construct to monitor indirect flight muscle development in normal and mutant Drosophila melanogaster strains. We used polymerase chain reaction to amplify a portion of the Act88F actin gene that includes 1420 nucleotides of flanking DNA, the transcription start, first intron, and initiator codon, incorporating the fragment into the Drosophila germ line transformation vector pCaSpeR. We fused the fragment to the gene encoding green fluorescent protein of the bioluminescent jellyfish Aequorea victoria. We could detect GFP protein in transgenic strains and found that its accumulation, conveniently visualized in living flies using epifluorescence microscopy, was limited to the indirect flight muscles. GFP fluorescence can be used to visualize all stages of flight muscle development subsequent to myoblast fusion nad facilitates the detection of morphological changes in fibers caused by particular mutations.",1995,"P Barthmaier, E Fyrberg, P Barthmaier, E Fyrberg"

"Structure, expression and duplication of genes which encode phosphoglyceromutase of Drosophila melanogaster",7828819,,"We report here the isolation and characterization of genes from Drosophila that encode the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglyceromutase (PGLYM). Two genomic regions have been isolated that have potential to encode PGLYM. Their cytogenetic localizations have been determined by in situ hybridization to salivary gland chromosomes. One gene, Pglym78, is found at 78A/B and the other, Pglym87, at 87B4,5 of the Drosophila polytene map. Pglym78 transcription follows a developmental pattern similar to other glycolytic genes in Drosophila, i.e., substantial maternal transcript deposited during oogenesis; a decline in abundance in the first half of embryogenesis; a subsequent increase in the second half of embryogenesis which continues throughout larval life; a decline in pupae and a second increase to a plateau in adults. This transcript has been mapped by cDNA and genomic sequence comparison, RNase protection, and primer extension. Using similar analyses transcripts of Pglym87 could not be detected. Pglym78 has two introns which interrupt the coding region, while the Pglym87 gene lacks introns. This and other features support a model of retrotransposition mediated gene duplication for the origin of Pglym87. The apparent absence of a complete, intact coding frame and transcript suggest that Pglym87 is a pseudogene. However, retention of reading frame and codon bias suggests that Pglym87 may retain coding function, or may have been inactivated recently, substantially after the time of duplication, or that the molecular evolution of Pglym87 is unusual. Similarities of the unusual molecular evolution of Pglym87 and other proposed pseudogenes are discussed.",1994,"P D Currie, D T Sullivan, P D Currie, D T Sullivan"
EVOLUTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF BODY SIZE AND CELL SIZE IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER IN RESPONSE TO TEMPERATURE,28564446,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1994.tb05311.x,"We examined the evolutionary and developmental responses of body size to temperature in Drosophila melanogaster, using replicated lines of flies that had been allowed to evolve for 5 yr at 25Â°C or at 16.5Â°C. Development and evolution at the lower temperature both resulted in higher thorax length and wing area. The evolutionary effect of temperature on wing area was entirely a consequence of an increase in cell area. The developmental response was mainly attributable to an increase in cell area, with a small effect on cell number in males. Given its similarity to the evolutionary response, the increase in body size and cell size resulting from development at low temperature may be a case of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. The pattern of plasticity did not evolve in response to temperature for any of the traits. The selective advantage of the evolutionary and developmental responses to temperature is obscure and remains a major challenge for future work.",1994,"Linda Partridge, Brian Barrie, Kevin Fowler, Vernon French, Linda Partridge, Brian Barrie, Kevin Fowler, Vernon French"

A highly conserved homologue of bovine neurocalcin in Drosophila melanogaster is a Ca(2+)-binding protein expressed in neuronal tissues,7989365,,"Polymerase chain reaction was used to search for genes encoding recoverin-like proteins in Drosophila melanogaster. We identified a gene that codes for a cognate of bovine neurocalcin; hence, we have named it neurocalcin (nca). A cDNA of nca was isolated and sequenced. The deduced polypeptide product of the cDNA is 22 kDa in size, and its amino acid sequence is 88% identical to that of bovine neurocalcin. This deduced Drosophila neurocalcin (DrosNCa) protein has three putative EF-hands and has a sequence in its NH2 terminus required for fatty acylation. DrosNCa was expressed in Escherichia coli and subsequently purified by phenyl-Sepharose chromatography and Mono Q anion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography. This recombinant protein was capable of binding 45Ca2+ and exhibited Ca(2+)-dependent mobility shifts in both SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and native gel electrophoresis. DrosNCa was tritiated when it was coexpressed in E. coli with N-myristoyl transferase in the presence of [3H]myristic acid. The nca transcript was approximately 1 kilobase long, and tissue in situ hybridization showed that this message was present in the brain of adult flies. Antibodies raised against recombinant DrosNCa cross-reacted with rat hippocalcin on an immunoblot but not with bovine recoverin. When immunohistochemical analysis was performed, staining was observed throughout the central nervous system of adult flies, particularly in the neuropil, where neurons synapse.

THE GENETICS OF VIABILITY IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER: EFFECTS OF INBREEDING AND ARTIFICIAL SELECTION,28564480,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1994.tb05312.x,"Inbreeding and artificial selection experiments were conducted to investigate the genetic properties of egg-to-pupa viability in a population of Drosophila melanogaster. The effect of different levels of inbreeding (F = 0, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.73) was studied. Up to F = 0.50, a linear depression of the mean viability was observed, accompanied by a significant increase of both within-line additive variance and between-line variance. At F = 0.73, no further changes were detected. This can be attributed to natural selection opposing high levels of homozygosity. In parallel, artificial selection to increase viability was performed for 27 generations in (1) a single undivided population (U) and (2) two populations with cycles of subdivision and between-line selection, followed by reconstitution of selected lines (SO and SI ). During the first cycle (generations 0-4), most of the final total response was achieved under all selection regimes. An advantage of the SO and SI strategies was observed after the completion of the first cycle. However, the same limit was reached in all cases because of a delayed response experienced by line U. Reverse selection for viability resulted in positive correlated responses for fecundity and mating success. Both inbreeding and selection results are compatible with the genetic variance of viability in the base population being generated by segregation at a few loci with substantial additive effects and several deleterious recessives at low initial frequencies. Possible reasons for the maintenance of that variance in natural populations are discussed.",1994,"Nieves GarcÃ­a, Carlos LÃ³pez-Fanjul, Aurora GarcÃ­a-Dorado, Nieves GarcÃ­a, Carlos LÃ³pez-Fanjul, Aurora GarcÃ­a-Dorado"

The response was shown to be dependent on the genotype of the flies tested, since lower frequencies of dominant lethals (DL) were only obtained in strains carrying the white mutation. Based on these observations experiments to locate the genetic factor responsible for the adaptive response (AR) were performed. This factor was found to be in a specific region of the X-chromosome. Additional experiments were carried out to give information on the minimal dose required to induce the AR. The results showed that the lowest dose needed is 0.2 mGy.

Four severe phenotypes representing defects in cytokinesis and/or cell shape maintenance were examined further. Each displayed drastic and specific reorganizations of the actin cytoskeleton. Three of the cDNAs responsible for these defects appear to encode cytoskeletal components: the actin binding proteins profilin and cofilin/actin depolymerizing factor and a membrane-cytoskeleton linker of the ezrin/merlin family.

The raspberry locus of Drosophila melanogaster includes an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase like coding sequence,7911114,10.1139/g94-046,"DNA from the raspberry gene of Drosophila melanogaster has been cloned through P-element tagging of a dysgenically induced lethal allele. A transcribed DNA segment adjacent to the P insert encodes an amino acid sequence that is similar to known inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) sequences. Further dysgenically induced lethals and all four known spontaneous ras eye-colour mutations have changes in the DNA either within or just upstream from the transcribed region. Identification of IMPDH as a probable product of the ras gene is compatible with the finding of an allele that requires dietary guanosine (GR), since the enzyme mediates the first of two biosynthetic steps leading from inosine monophosphate (IMP) to guanosine monophosphate (GMP). However, other auxotrophic mutants at the locus remain unexplained by the finding. The results further suggest that GMP synthesis from IMP is an essential process, despite the capacity of the fly for salvage synthesis of GMP from GR.

The basis for germline specificity of the hobo transposable element in Drosophila melanogaster,8157003,,"Previous results suggested that the hobo transposable element is active predominantly in the germline of Drosophila. We investigate germline restriction of hobo transposition by testing in vitro modified elements for their ability to mobilize marked elements in vivo. Although intact hobo elements are germline specific, an hsp70 promoter-hobo transposase fusion is active in the soma. Analysis of the hsp70-promoted transcript does not provide evidence for splicing. Moreover, the hobo promoter confers germline bias to a highly sensitive reporter, delta 2-3 P transposase. These results indicate that hobo transposition is germline specific due to regulation of transposase production at the level of transcription. Thus, although hobo is similar to the P transposable element in organization and tissue specificity, it differs in the underlying mechanism governing germline specific activity.",1994,"B R Calvi, W M Gelbart, B R Calvi, W M Gelbart"

"Weakener of white (Wow), a gene that modifies the expression of the white eye color locus and that suppresses position effect variegation in Drosophila melanogaster",7982560,,"A locus is described in Drosophila melanogaster that modifies the expression of the white eye color gene. This trans-acting modifier reduces the expression of the white gene in the eye, but elevates the expression in other adult tissues. Because of the eye phenotype in which the expression of white is lessened but not eliminated, the newly described locus is called the Weakener of white (Wow). Northern analysis reveals that Wow can exert an inverse or direct modifying effect depending upon the developmental stage. Two related genes, brown and scarlet, that are coordinately expressed with white, are also affected by Wow. In addition, Wow modulates the steady state RNA level of the retrotransposon, copia. When tested with a white promoter-Alcohol dehydrogenase reporter. Wow confers the modifying effect to the reporter, suggesting a requirement of the white regulatory sequences for mediating the response. In addition to being a dosage sensitive regulator of white, brown, scarlet and copia, Wow acts as a suppressor of position effect variegation. There are many dosage sensitive suppressors of position effect variegation and many dosage-sensitive modifiers of gene expression. The Wow mutations provide evidence for an overlap between the two types of modifiers.",1994,"J A Birchler, U Bhadra, L Rabinow, R Linsk, A T Nguyen-Huynh, J A Birchler, U Bhadra, L Rabinow, R Linsk, A T Nguyen-Huynh"
A Drosophila gene promoter is subject to glucose repression in yeast cells,7526389,10.1073/pnas.91.23.11109,"Previous work has shown that the alpha-amylase gene of Drosophila melanogaster is subject to repression by dietary glucose. Moreover, glucose repression of this gene is mediated by promoter elements that lie upstream of the transcriptional start site. In this study, we examined the activity of the glucose-repressible Drosophila promoter in transformed yeast cells. We show that the amylase promoter region can mediate glucose repression of a heterologous reporter gene in yeast. The implication of this result is that the yeast regulatory machinery can recognize the Drosophila promoter signals. This, in turn, implies an unexpectedly high degree of evolutionary conservation in the mechanism of glucose repression among eukaryotes. It also shows that genes that have acquired complex patterns of developmental regulation-e.g., the Drosophila amylase gene, can still retain, intact, more primitive forms of regulation, such as glucose repression.",1994,"D A Hickey, K I Benkel, Y Fong, B F Benkel, D A Hickey, K I Benkel, Y Fong, B F Benkel"

Effects of autosomal inversions on meiotic exchange in distal and proximal regions of the X chromosome in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster,8206367,10.1017/s0016672300032080,"We have investigated the interchromosomal effect of the naturally-occurring paracentric inversions In(2L)t and In(3R)P on meiotic recombination in two regions of the X chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster. Previous authors have suggested that the rate of recombination at the tip of the X chromosome may be substantially higher in some natural populations than values measured in the laboratory, due to the interchromosomal effect of heterozygous autosomal inversions. This suggestion was motivated by observations that transposable elements are not as common at the tip of the X chromosome as predicted by recent research relating reduced meiotic exchange to increased element abundance in D. melanogaster. We examined the effects of heterozygous In(2L)t and In(3R)P on recombination at both the tip and base of the X chromosome on a background of isogenic major chromosomes from a natural population. Both inversions substantially increased the rate of recombination at the base; neither one affected recombination at the tip.

Doc and copia instability in an isogenic Drosophila melanogaster stock,8394986,10.1007/BF00277071,"A high degree of heterogeneity and an overall increase in number of insertion sites of the mobile elements Doc and copia were revealed in one substock of an isogenic Drosophila melanogaster stock, while in two other substocks the distribution of copia sites was highly homogenous, but that of Doc sites was again heterogeneous.

Doc and copia transpositions were directly observed in experiments with one substock. An abundance of copia insertions was revealed in the X chromosome where insertions with deleterious effects are exposed to selection in hemizygous condition.

Studies on mutagen sensitive strains of Drosophila melanogaster. XI. Survival (dominant lethality) after X-irradiation and relation to recessive lethals and translocations,7678905,10.1016/0027-5107(93)90120-5,"Muller-5 males of Drosophila melanogaster were irradiated in N2 or O2 and mated to excision repair deficient, post-replication repair deficient (mei-9a, mei-41D5, mus101D1, mus201D1, mus302D1, mus306D1 and mus308D2) or repair proficient females. The surviving fraction (dominant lethality) was estimated in the F1 and used to reassess existing recessive lethal and translocation data. The surviving fraction was found to decrease if repair deficient females were used (maternal effect). The dose-effect curves are often biphasic with a steeper slope at low doses than at high (> or = 5 Gy) doses of X-rays. The high dose part of the curve is sensitive to oxygenation during irradiation and is affected significantly by the mutants with low fertility (mei-9, mus101 and mus302). The low dose component is not sensitive to oxygenation during irradiation and seems influenced by all seven repair deficient mutants. The sensitivity of the high dose part to oxygenation suggests that this part is related mainly to DNA break damage, while in the low dose part base damage seems more important. Existing recessive lethal and translocation data were plotted against the surviving fraction for a reassessment. In excision repair deficient mutants translocation induction is lower compared to repair proficient flies at the same level of survival (i.e., dominant lethality). Likewise in post-replication repair deficient mutants induction of recessive lethals is decreased. However the frequency of respectively induced recessive lethals and translocations obtained at the same level of X-rays was the same in repair deficient and proficient backgrounds. It is concluded that genetic damage recovered in a repair deficient background is likely to be qualitatively different even if the frequency of the damage induced by a given dose is not altered.",1993,"W Ferro, J C Eeken, W Ferro, J C Eeken"

The cDNA deduced protein sequence for FTZ-F1 beta displays significant amino acid identity with other vertebrate and invertebrate nuclear receptors, most notably with FTZ-F1. Also, bacterially expressed FTZ-F1 beta protein binds to a FTZ-F1 binding site found in the zebra stripe promoter element of the segmentation gene fushi tarazu (ftz). Northern blot analysis detected FTZ-F1 beta expression at all stages of the Drosophila life cycle including a possible maternal component. In situ hybridization in whole-mounted embryos localized transcripts for FTZ-F1 beta evenly expressed throughout the blastodermal layer in early embryos. At later stages of development strong FTZ-F1 beta expression is observed in both the brain and ventral chord structures as well as in the hindgut. Temporal and spatial expression patterns of the FTZ-F1 beta gene suggest that it may have multiple roles in early embryogenesis, neurogenesis, and in the adult. Furthermore, the identification of FTZ-F1 beta as a nuclear receptor family member suggests that an as yet undiscovered FTZ-F1 beta specific ligand is involved in Drosophila development.",1993,"C K Ohno, M Petkovich, C K Ohno, M Petkovich"

Conservation and change in structural and 5' flanking sequences of esterase 6 in sibling Drosophila species,8375665,10.1007/BF02424448,"Esterase 6 (Est-6/EST6) is the major beta-carboxylesterase in D. melanogaster and its siblings D. simulans and D. mauritiana. It is expressed in several tissues but its major site of expression is the sperm ejaculatory duct of the adult male. Although EST6 activity affects reproductive fitness, there are high levels of electrophoretic and activity polymorphism, at least within D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Here we present the nucleotide sequences of an Est-6 allele and its flanking regions from each of D. simulans and D. mauritiana and compare them with the published D. melanogaster sequences. As might be expected, replacement sites are significantly less divergent than exon silent sites in all comparisons, suggesting that selection is acting to maintain EST6 structure and function among the three species. Nevertheless, the ratio of the levels of replacement to silent site divergence is still much higher for Est-6 than for seven of ten other genes (including both isozyme-coding loci) for which comparable data have been published for these species. This is consistent with the high levels of EST6 electrophoretic polymorphism within D. melanogaster and D. simulans and implies that selective constraints against amino acid change are relatively weak for EST6. By contrast, comparisons involving promotor sequences show that the level of divergence in the first 350bp 5' of the gene is significantly lower than those for four of the six other loci for which comparable data have been published for these species. In particular, there are two perfectly conserved stretches (-1 to -158bp and -219 to -334bp) each over 100bp long included in this 350bp region. Thus the data suggest a relatively low level of selective constraint on the amino acid sequence of EST6 but a relatively high level of constraint on sequences affecting aspects of its expression.",1993,"J Karotam, A C Delves, J G Oakeshott, J Karotam, A C Delves, J G Oakeshott"

Dromyosuppressin shares a high degree of sequence homology with leucomyosuppressin isolated from cockroach (pEDVDHVFLRFamide) and identity with neomyosuppressin isolated from fleshfly. By means of sequence-specific antisera, the cellular expression pattern of dromyosuppressin immunoreactive material was determined for all stages of Drosophila development. Dromyosuppressin immunoreactivity first appears in two cells of the medial protocerebrum in embryos. The larval stage is characterized by an increase in the number of dromyosuppressin immunoreactive cells in the brain and the first appearance of cellular expression in the ventral ganglion. Immunoreactive fibers extend from the medial protocerebrum cells into the ventral ganglion. Relative to the larval stage, the pupal and adult stages are marked by an increase in the number of immunoreactive cells in the central nervous system and an increase in the arborization of immunoreactive fibers extending from these cells. Immunoreactivity is present in larvae in two cells near the anus; in the adult gut, expression is observed in two cells in the rectum and immunoreactive fibers in the crop that appear to extend from the central nervous system. In general, the number of cells containing dromyosuppressin immunoreactive material increases throughout Drosophila development.

The proportion of amphiphilic choline acetyltransferase in Drosophila melanogaster is higher than in rat or Torpedo and is developmentally regulated,8508306,10.1016/0006-8993(93)90876-o,"We show that in the central nervous system of the fly, Drosophila melanogaster, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity exists under two molecular forms, a soluble, hydrophilic form and a membrane-bound, amphiphilic form. This is based on the following demonstrations of differential solubilization and interaction with non-denaturing detergents: sequential extraction of Drosophila heads produced low-salt-soluble (83-87%) and detergent-soluble (6-7%) ChAT activity. Sedimentation in sucrose gradients of detergent-soluble ChAT was found to be influenced by the type of detergent present in the gradient (Triton X-100 and Brij 96). This was not the case for low-salt-soluble ChAT. To further confirm these findings, we subjected Drosophila heads to Triton X-114 fractionation. This method, which yielded 12% of amphiphilic ChAT activity, separates hydrophilic from amphiphilic proteins. Compared to central nervous tissue of rat and Torpedo electric lobes, Drosophila head contained the highest proportion of amphiphilic ChAT activity. Synaptosomes isolated from Torpedo electric organ exhibited higher levels of amphiphilic ChAT than did electric lobes. Of the three animal species analyzed here, the Torpedo amphiphilic enzyme was the most hydrophobic and the rat enzyme the least hydrophobic. The proportion of amphiphilic ChAT was analyzed during Drosophila development. The percentage of this activity increased about 7 times from embryo to larva and then remained constant until the adult fly age.",1993,"N Salem, J Medilanski, N Pellegrinelli, L Eder-Colli, N Salem, J Medilanski, N Pellegrinelli, L Eder-Colli"

The role of the ovarian tumor locus in Drosophila melanogaster germ line sex determination,8275850,,"The locus ovarian tumor (otu) is involved in several aspects of oogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. The possible role of otu in the determination of the sexual identity of germ cells has not been extensively explored. Some otu alleles produce a phenotype known as ovarian tumors: ovarioles are filled with numerous poorly differentiated germ cells. We show that these mutant germ cells have a morphology similar to primary spermatocytes and that they express male germ line-specific reporter genes. This indicates that they are engaged along the male pathway of germ line differentiation. Consistent with this conclusion, we found that the splicing of Sex-lethal (Sxl) pre-mRNAs occurs in the male-specific mode in otu-transformed germ cells. The position of the otu locus in the regulatory cascade of germ line sex determination has been studied by using mutations that constitutively express the feminizing activity of the Sxl gene. The sexual transformation of the germ cells observed with several combinations of otu alleles can be reversed by constitutive expression of Sxl. This shows that otu acts upstream of Sxl in the process of germ line sex determination. Other phenotypes of otu mutations were not rescued by constitutive expression of Sxl, suggesting that several functions of otu are likely to be independent of sex determination. Finally, we show that the gene dosage of otu modifies the phenotype of ovaries heterozygous for the dominant alleles of ovo, another gene involved in germ line sex determination. One dose of otu+ enhances the ovoD ovarian phenotypes, while three doses partially suppress these phenotypes. Synergistic interaction between ovoD1 and otu alleles leads to the occasional transformation of chromosomally female germ cells into early spermatocytes. These interactions are similar to those observed between ovoD and one allele of the sans fille (snf) locus. Altogether, our results imply that the otu locus acts, along with ovo, snf, and Sxl, in a pathway (or parallel pathways) required for proper sex determination of the female germ line.",1993,"D Pauli, B Oliver, A P Mahowald, D Pauli, B Oliver, A P Mahowald"

These images show that topo II is concentrated at specific sites within the interphase nucleus and that this localization is temporally regulated. The enzyme is not restricted to a central chromosome axis, but is distributed uniformly throughout the chromosome. During mitosis, the enzyme present in the early prophase chromosome is lost in two stages, following prophase and following anaphase. Overall, 70% of the enzyme leaves the nucleus and diffuses into the cytoplasm. The localization of the enzyme thus correlates with its role in chromosome condensation and segregation. Rather than being solely a structural protein, topo II appears to localize at the sites on the chromosome where it is required.",1993,"J R Swedlow, J W Sedat, D A Agard, J R Swedlow, J W Sedat, D A Agard"

The three rows gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a novel protein that is required for chromosome disjunction during mitosis,8305737,10.1091/mbc.4.11.1161,"Zygotic expression of the three rows (thr) gene of Drosophila melanogaster is required for normal cell proliferation during embryogenesis. Mitotic defects in thr mutant embryos begin during mitosis 15, and all subsequent divisions are disrupted. Chromosome disjunction and consequently cytokinesis fail during these defective mitoses, although the initial mitotic processes (chromosome condensation, spindle assembly, metaphase plate formation, and cyclin degradation) are not affected. Despite the failure of chromosome disjunction and cytokinesis, later mitotic events (chromosome decondensation) and subsequent cell cycle progression continue. The thr gene has been isolated and shown to encode a 1209 amino acid protein that shares no extended sequence similarity with known proteins. thr mRNA is present as maternal mRNA that degrades at the time of cellularization. At this and all subsequent times during embryogenesis, zygotic expression correlates with mitotic proliferation. These observations, together with the observation that the zygotic phenotype of thr mutant embryos is influenced by the maternal genotype, suggest that the embryonic phenotype results from exhaustion of the maternal thr contribution and does not reflect a developmentally restricted requirement for thr function. Our results indicate that the novel thr product is required specifically for chromosome disjunction during all mitoses.",1993,"R J D'Andrea, R Stratmann, C F Lehner, U P John, R Saint, R J D'Andrea, R Stratmann, C F Lehner, U P John, R Saint"
Characterization of glucose transport system in Drosophila Kc cells,7678820,10.1016/0014-5793(93)81284-7,"We have characterized the glucose transport system in the Kc cells of Drosophila melanogaster. The transporter is stereospecific and can be inhibited by both cytochalasin B and phloretin, with ki values of 4 microM and 30 microM for cytochalasin B and phloretin, respectively. Moreover, phlordzin does not affect uptake of glucose by Kc cells. Thus, on the basis of inhibitor studies, it appears that this insect cell line contains glucose transporters similar to those of the mammalian cells. However, probes prepared from rat transporter cDNAs showed no cross-hybridization with Drosophila RNA under moderately stringent conditions. Sugar selectively has also been investigated by competition assay. The km values for D-glucose, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, D-fructose and D-galactose are 2 mM, 6 mM, 17 mM and 16 mM, respectively. The results indicate that this transporter prefers D-glucose and that it does not discriminate between D-galactose and D-fructose.",1993,"M Wang, C Wang, M Wang, C Wang"

A simple screening protocol has been used to isolate several mutations that partially suppress the temperature-sensitive paralytic phenotype of shibire(ts2) mutant animals. All of these mutations very tightly linked to shibire and are likely to be second site intragenic mutations that restore partial activity to the shibire(ts2) product. The mutations suppress both behavioral, and easily-scored developmental phenotypes of shibire(ts2) characterized in this paper.

Isolation and characterisation of murine homologues of the Drosophila seven in absentia gene (sina),8404535,,"The seven in absentia gene (sina) is required for formation of the R7 photoreceptor cell in the developing eye of Drosophila melanogaster. The sina protein contains a putative zinc finger domain and localises to the cell nucleus in Drosophila. We report here the identification of a family of genes in the mouse (designated Siah) with extensive sequence homology to Drosophila sina. The Siah genes fall into two main groups: Siah-1, which consists of four closely related members, two of which appear to be functional, and Siah-2, which contains a single functional member. The predicted Siah proteins show an unusually high degree of conservation with sina over the majority of their lengths, diverging significantly only at their amino terminal ends. The Siah-1 and Siah-2 genes are widely expressed at a low level in the embryo and adult. Analysis of Siah-2 by hybridisation histochemistry shows that it is expressed at a higher level in a restricted number of sites during development, including the olfactory epithelium, retina, forebrain and proliferating cartilage of developing bone. The striking degree of sequence homology observed between the Drosophila and murine genes implies strong conservation pressure on the Siah genes and suggests that they play a significant role in vertebrate development.",1993,"N G Della, P V Senior, D D Bowtell, N G Della, P V Senior, D D Bowtell"
Inbreeding depression and male-mating behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,8375666,10.1007/BF02424449,"There have been relatively few studies designed to investigate the effects of inbreeding on behavioral traits. To study this phenomenon, five experimental lines of Drosophila melanogaster made isogenic for chromosome 2 were evaluated for their male-mating ability and, subsequently, male courtship behavior. All lines showed significant reductions in overall mating ability, and males from all of these lines displayed impaired mating behavior, with two lines displaying particularly aberrant courtship patterns. Line 16 displayed an inability to successfully initiate copulation following successful courtship, while line 17 displayed significant reduction in locomotor activity, resulting in virtually no successful courtship or copulatory activity. The implications of these findings for competitive mating ability in wild Drosophila populations are presented. Further, the importance of mating success as a fitness component in the management of potentially highly inbred populations of endangered species is discussed.",1993,"P S Miller, J Glasner, P W Hedrick, P S Miller, J Glasner, P W Hedrick"
Identification of short tandemly repeated sequences in extrachromosomal circular DNAs from Drosophila melanogaster embryos,8514153,10.1139/g93-034,"A sequence (scl) belonging to the recently identified dodeca satellite family was found to be a major family of extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules from Drosophila melanogaster embryos. The basic unit consists of the 11-bp repeat 5' ACTGGTCCCGT 3', is 63% G + C rich, and shares some similarity with the Escherichia coli chi sequence. This family accounts for only about 0.06% of the genome but very likely for a higher proportion of the circular DNA molecules. It is organized in the genome into at least five main clusters contained in DNA fragments larger than 20 kb and several minor clusters. These clusters are located in the heterochromatic pericentromeric regions. Two other families of simple repeated sequences, the 1.686 g/cm3 (5' AATAACATAG 3') and the 1.705 g/cm3 (5' AAGAG 3') satellite DNAs, were also found in circular DNAs, while another family, the 1.672 g/cm3 (5' AATAT 3'), was not detected. The representation of the simple repeated sequences in circular molecules is not correlated to their genomic representation. Among the seven families of sequences identified to date in extrachromosomal circular DNAs from embryos, the dodeca satellite, the 240-bp repeat of the rDNA intergenic spacer, and the 1.688 and 1.705 g/cm3 satellite DNAs are the most represented families, while the 5S genes, the histone genes, and the 1.686 g/cm3 satellite DNA are present in a lower amount.",1993,"S Renault, F Degroote, G Picard, S Renault, F Degroote, G Picard"
Characterization of the mus308 gene in Drosophila melanogaster,8417992,,"Among the available mutagen-sensitive mutations in Drosophila, those at the mus308 locus are unique in conferring hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents but not to monofunctional agents. Those mutations are also associated with an elevated frequency of chromosomal aberrations, altered DNA metabolism and the modification of a deoxyribonuclease. This spectrum of phenotypes is shared with selected mammalian mutations including Fanconi anemia in humans. In anticipation of the molecular characterization of the mus308 gene, it has been localized cytogenetically to 87C9-87D1,2 on the right arm of chromosome three. Nine new mutant alleles of the gene have been generated by X-ray mutagenesis and one was recovered following hybrid dysgenesis. Characterization of these new alleles has uncovered additional phenotypes of mutations at this locus. Homozygous mus308 flies that have survived moderate mutagen treatment exhibit an altered wing position that is correlated with reduced flight ability and an altered mitochondrial morphology. In addition, observations of elevated embryo mortality are potentially explained by an aberrant distribution of nuclear material in early embryos which is similar to that seen in the mutant giant nuclei.",1993,"E A Leonhardt, D S Henderson, J E Rinehart, J B Boyd, E A Leonhardt, D S Henderson, J E Rinehart, J B Boyd"
Properties of transgenic strains of Drosophila melanogaster containing I transposable elements from Drosophila teissieri,8391503,10.1017/s0016672300031177,"I factors are transposable elements of Drosophila melanogaster similar to mammalian LINEs, that transpose by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate and are responsible for the I-R system of hybrid dysgenesis. There are two categories of strains in this species: inducer, that contain about 15 I elements at the various sites on chromosomal arms, and reactive, that lack active I factors. I elements occur in various Drosophila species. Potentially functional I factors from Drosophila teissieri can transpose when introduced by P-element-mediated transformation in a reactive strain of Drosophila melanogaster. We have studied the properties of Drosophila melanogaster strains into which such an I factor from Drosophila teissieri, named Itei, was introduced. Typical hybrid dysgenesis is produced when males carrying Itei are crossed with reactive females. However, more than one copy of the element seems necessary to produce dysgenic traits, whereas only one I factor of Drosophila melanogaster seems to be sufficient. The copy number of Itei in transformed lines maintained by endogamous crosses increases rapidly and stabilizes at values similar to those observed in inducer strains. As Drosophila teissieri contains much fewer copies than the Drosophila melanogaster strains, this suggests that the copy number of I elements is not simply regulated by sequences present in the element itself.",1993,"C Vaury, A PÃ©lisson, P Abad, A Bucheton, C Vaury, A PÃ©lisson, P Abad, A Bucheton"
Evolution of delayed reproductive senescence in male fruit flies: sperm competition,8125263,10.1007/BF01435992,"Populations of Drosophila melanogaster that had been subjected to long-term selection favoring either delayed or rapid senescence were compared with respect to age-specific components of male reproductive success involving sperm competition. These components of reproductive success were divided into those related to sperm 'defense' (protection of sperm from other males), and into those related to sperm 'offense' (ability to mate with previously mated females and to displace the sperm of other males). Males were tested at four ages ranging from 1-2 d to 5-6 wk after eclosion. Several aspects of sperm defense capability showed clear evidence of senescent decline. Furthermore, males from populations selected for delayed senescence were superior to males from control (rapid senescence) populations with regard to components of sperm defense. The superiority of males from populations with delayed senescence either increased as a function of male age, or was present at all ages tested. These results indicate that the rate of reproductive senescence in male D. melanogaster can be altered in predictable directions by artificial selection. There were no differences between selection regimes with regard to sperm offense, and most components of sperm offense did not show clear evidence of senescence. The improved late-age reproductive success of males from populations selected for delayed senescence did not appear to entail any cost or trade-off at early ages with respect to the reproductive traits examined in these experiments.",1993,"P M Service, A J Fales, P M Service, A J Fales"
A genetic analysis of bx bxd cis double mutants in the Drosophila Ultrabithorax gene,8676857,10.1007/BF02174442,"The Ultrabithorax (Ubx) gene of Drosophila melanogaster includes two functionally distinguishable regions. One is the Ubx transcription unit, which gives rise by alternative splicing to a family of morphogenetic Ubx proteins (UBX). The other is its upstream bithoraxoid (bxd) region. On the basis of genetic and molecular studies, it is generally assumed that the Ubx transcription unit contains internal positively acting cis-regulatory elements controlling UBX expression in the T3a compartment of the body of Drosophila, while the bxd region contains positive cis-regulatory elements controlling UBX expression in the T3p and A1a compartments. We have performed a genetic analysis of bx bxd cis double mutant chromosomes containing one mutation (bx alleles) affecting the Ubx unit, and a second (bxd alleles) affecting the bxd region of the Ubx gene. Our study of different bx bxd/bx combinations shows that bxd alleles partially rescue the adult mutant phenotypes of bx alleles, which suggests that the bxd region contains a negative cis-regulatory element involved in the control of the activity of the Ubx gene in the T3a compartment.",1996,"A MartÃ­nez-Laborda, J Serrano-Cartagena, J L Micol, A MartÃ­nez-Laborda, J Serrano-Cartagena, J L Micol"

In this analysis, we have used nanos 3'UTR deletion mutants to define the localization signal more precisely. Our results indicate that the nanos RNA localization signal is large and complex and that targeting of nanos RNA may be achieved by the combined effects of multiple, partially independent sequences.

Female fitness in Drosophila melanogaster: an interaction between the effect of nutrition and of encounter rate with males,8763795,10.1098/rspb.1996.0113,"Female Drosophila melanogaster were maintained at five levels of nutrition, with either continuous or intermittent exposure to males. Remaining frequency increased with nutrition and was higher with continuous exposure to males. Age-specific and lifetime egg production increased with increasing nutrition, but lifespan peaked at intermediate nutrition. Females on the three highest nutritional levels showed a cost of mating in reduced survival, but only at the highest food level did this reduced lifespan lead to a significant cost of mating for lifetime egg production. The data suggest that remating frequencies in laboratory cultures may evolve to a low enough level for the cost of mating to be only weakly expressed, if at all. Further data are required to assess the importance of the cost of mating in natural populations, where the evolution of low remating frequencies might be expected to be opposed by other costs.",1996,"T Chapman, L Partridge, T Chapman, L Partridge"

The insertion is a truncated retroposable element, jockey, inserted upstream of the adult Adh enhancer region. Comparisons between the Adhjockey allele and its direct wild-type ancestral allele were made in an isogenic background (i.e. identical cis and trans factors). Differences in Adhjockey expression compared with the wild-type can be attributed solely to the presence of the jockey element. This jockey insertion results in a decrease in adult mRNA transcript levels in the Adhjockey homozygous lines relative to the wild-type counterpart and accounts for a correlated decrease in alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzyme activity. The larval ADH activity levels are not detectably different.",1996,"L D White, J W Jacobson, L D White, J W Jacobson"

The white-ivory eye spot test makes use of the white-ivory (wi) quadruplication and detects the somatic reversion of the recessive eye color mutation wi to the wild-type (w+). Three- or two-day-old larvae were fed chronically with the compounds ethylnitrosourea (ENU), N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NNP), caffeine (CAF), chromium (VI) oxide (CRO), potassium chromate (POC), and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D).

The isolation and sequencing of cDNA and genomic clones reveals that stoned appears to encode a dicistronic mRNA, although the possible existence of other forms of mRNA cannot be excluded. Antibody cross-reactivity shows that two proteins are translated from the stoned locus in vivo. Both open reading frames (ORFs) encode novel proteins.

To elucidate how these positive and negative signalling mechanisms co-operate in the normal fate determination of R7, genetic interactions of mutations in the pok locus with ttk and downstream elements of sev including Gap1, raf1, rolled (r1) and seven in absentia (sina) were examined. The eye phenotype of a weak hypomorph, pok 15, was enhanced dominantly by Gap1-mip, a recessive mutation in a gene encoding a down-regulator of Ras1, producing multiple R7 in ommatidia. Ras1 has been reported to activate r1-encoded mitrogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase via Raf1 that is associated physically with Rasl. Ommatidia of raf1 c110 and rl 2/rlEMS64 typically lacked R7 and a few outer photoreceptors. The pok 1 mutation suppressed dominantly the rafl c110 rl2/rlEMS64 eye phenotypes, allowing single R7 cells to develop in ommatidia. The rafl c110 mutation improved adult viability of pok 1 homozygotes. An in vitro experiment demonstrated that MAP kinase phosphorylates Pok protein. Ttk is a transcriptional repressor which binds to the regulatory sequence upstream of the fushi-tarazu (ftz), even skipped (eve) and engrailed (en) coding region.

THE CONTRIBUTION OF NEW MUTATIONS TO GENOTYPE-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION FOR FITNESS IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,28565671,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03619.x,"Many studies have documented the existence of genotype-environment interaction (GEI) for traits closely related to fitness in natural populations. A type of GEI that is commonly observed is changes in the fitness ranking of genetic groups (families, clones, or inbred lines) in different environments. We refer to such changes in ranking as crossing of reaction norms for fitness. A common interpretation of crossing of reaction norms for fitness is that selection favors different alleles in the different environments (i.e., that ""trade-offs"" exist). If this is the case, selection could maintain genetic variation, and even lead to reproductive isolation between subpopulations using different environments. Even if the same alleles are favored in every environment, however, deleterious mutations that vary in the magnitude of their effect depending on environment could cause reaction norms for fitness to cross. If deleterious mutations with environment-dependent effects are responsible for maintaining much of the variation leading to crossing of reaction norms for fitness in natural populations, it should be possible to observe crossing of reaction norms for fitness among otherwise genetically identical lines bearing newly arisen spontaneous mutations. We examined the contribution of new mutations to GEI for fitness in Drosophila melanogaster. Eighteen lines were derived from a common, highly inbred base stock, and maintained at a population size of 10 pairs for over 200 generations, to allow them to accumulate spontaneous mutations. Because of the small population size of the lines, selection against mildly deleterious mutations should have been relatively ineffective. The lines were tested for productivity (number of surviving adult progeny from a standard number of parents) in five different environmental treatments, comprising different food media, temperatures, and levels of competition. The lines showed highly significant GEI for productivity, owing largely to considerable changes in ranking in the different environments. We conclude that mutations that are deleterious on average, but whose quantitative effects depend on environment, could be responsible for maintaining much of the variation leading to crossing of reaction norms for fitness that has been observed in samples of D. melanogaster from the wild.",1996,"James D Fry, Stefanie L Heinsohn, Trudy F C Mackay, James D Fry, Stefanie L Heinsohn, Trudy F C Mackay"
Cloning of an arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (aaNAT1) from Drosophila melanogaster expressed in the nervous system and the gut,8901578,10.1073/pnas.93.22.12315,"In insects, neurotransmitter catabolism, melatonin precursor formation, and sclerotization involve arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (aaNAT, EC 2.3.1.87) activity.

In situ hybridization studies of aaNAT1 mRNA in embryos reveal hybridization signals in the brain, the ventral cord, the gut, and probably in oenocytes, indicating a broad tissue distribution of aaNAT1 transcripts. Moreover, in day/ night studies we demonstrate a diurnal rhythm of melatonin concentration without a clear-cut change in aaNAT1 mRNA levels.

Only one gene was monomorphic. Eight genes were polymorphic in all populations, with a total number of alleles varying between five and 12 for 120 chromosomes. The average heterozygozity per locus and population was 0.41. Selective neutrality in length variation could not be rejected under the assumptions of the infinite allele model. Significant population subdivision was found though no geographical pattern emerged, all populations being equally different. Significant linkage disequilibrium was found in four out of seven cases where the genetic distance between loci was < 1 cM and was negligible when the distance was larger. There is evidence that these associations were established after the populations separated. An unexpected result was that variation at each locus was independent of the coefficient of exchange, although the latter ranged from zero to the relatively high value of 6.7%. This would indicate that background selection and selective hitchhiking, which are thought to affect levels of nucleotide substitution polymorphism, have no effect on trinucleotide repeat variation.",1996,"Y Michalakis, M Veuille, Y Michalakis, M Veuille"
Distinct difference in relative biological effectiveness of 252Cf neutrons for the induction of mitotic crossing over and intragenic reversion of the white-ivory allele in Drosophila melanogaster,8876678,10.1016/0027-5107(96)00076-0,"The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 252Cf neutrons was determined for two different types of somatic mutations, i.e., loss heterozygosity for wing-hair mutations and reversion of the mutant white-ivory eye-color, in Drosophila melanogaster. Loss of heterozygosity for wing-hair mutations results predominantly from mitotic crossing over induced in wing anlage cells of larvae, while the reverse mutation of eye color is due to an intragenic structural change in the white locus on the X-chromosome. For a quantitative comparison of RBE values for these events, we have constructed a combined mutation assay system so that induced mutant wing-hair clones as well as revertant eye-color clones can be detected simultaneously in the same individuals. Larvae were irradiated at the age of 80 +/- 4 h post-oviposition with 252Cf neutrons or 137Cs gamma-rays, and male adult flies were examined under the microscope for the presence of the two types of clonal mosaic spots appearing. The induction of wing-hair spots per dose unit was much greater for 252Cf neutrons than for 137Cs gamma-rays, whereas the frequencies of eye-color reversion were similar for neutrons and gamma-rays. The estimated RBE values of neutrons were 8.5 and 1.2 for the induction of mutant wing-hair spots and revertant eye-color spots, respectively. These results indicate that the RBE of neutrons is much greater for mitotic crossing over in comparison to the intragenic white-ivory reversion events. Possible causes for the difference in RBE are discussed.",1996,"I Yoshikawa, M Hoshi, M Ikenaga, I Yoshikawa, M Hoshi, M Ikenaga"
Identification of ovarian enhancer-binding factors which bind to ovarian enhancer 1 of the Drosophila genes yp1 and yp2,8676877,10.1007/BF02172525,"It has been reported that three different DNA regions-the fat body enhancer and ovarian enhancers 1 and 2-direct the tissue-specific expression of yp1 and yp2 in Drosophila melanogaster. In the present study, we identified ovarian enhancer 1-specific binding proteins. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that these proteins are present in the adult ovary, but not in adult testis or fat body. Southwestern blot analysis showed that about 130 kDa and 40 kDa proteins, designated OEF1 and OEF2, respectively, from ovarian nuclear or crude extracts bind specifically to the ovarian enhancer 1. The two proteins were partially purified by streptavidin/agarose-DNA affinity chromatography, and their binding activity was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay.

Three second chromosome-linked clustered Cyp6 genes show differential constitutive and barbital-induced expression in DDT-resistant and susceptible strains of Drosophila melanogaster,8973362,10.1016/s0378-1119(96)00446-5,"The level of expression of the Cyp6a2 gene is much higher in the DDT-resistant 91-R strain than in the susceptible 91-C strain of Drosophila melanogaster (Waters et al. (1992b) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89, 4855-4859). To understand the role of Cyp6a2 and related genes in insecticide resistance, we have isolated and characterized two new Cyp6 genes from the 91-R strain. The polypeptides encoded by these two genes, Cyp6a8 and Cyp6a9, show 77 and 75% amino acid sequence similarity, and 60 and 55% identity with Cyp6a2 of D. melanogaster, respectively. In the genome, Cyp6a8 and Cyp6a9 genes are closely clustered within 4 kb and map at region 51C of the second chromosome. In between them another Cyp gene is present which is more related to Cyp6a9 than to Cyp6a8. The Cyp6a8 gene which is transcriptionally highly active in 91-R, moderately active in ry506 and silent in the 91-C strain hybridizes with 2.0- and 1.8-kb RNAs. Two different-sized RNAs, 2.1 and 1.8 kb, also hybridize with the Cyp6a9 and/or Cyp6a9-related genes. While the level of 2.1-kb RNA is similar in all three strains, the level of 1.8-kb RNA is highest in the 91-R strain and barely detectable in 91-C strain. Transgenic experiments showed that a 8.3-kb BamHI fragment contains the cis-regulatory elements for the expression of both Cyp6a8 and Cyp6a9-related genes. Barbital induces all these genes in all three strains and increases the levels of the two Cyp6a8 transcripts and the 1.8-kb RNA produced by the Cyp6a9 and/or Cyp6a9-related genes. Expression of the Cyp6a8 gene is down-regulated in the hybrids of 91-R and 91-C strains despite the fact that the hybrids carry one copy of the highly active allele of the Cyp6a8 gene of the 91-R strain. Based on these results we propose that the Cyp6a8 gene in 91-C strain may be turned off by an active repressor which might be inhibited by barbital treatment. In the 91-R strain, the putative repressor may be defective, allowing high level of constitutive expression of the Cyp6a8 gene.",1996,"S Maitra, S M Dombrowski, L C Waters, R Ganguly, S Maitra, S M Dombrowski, L C Waters, R Ganguly"

In Drosophila, such a regulatory mechanism has not been elucidated. We report the molecular cloning and characterization of DGCN2, a Drosophila eIF-2alpha kinase related to yeast GCN2 protein kinase. DGCN2 contains all of the 12 catalytic subdomains characteristic of eukaryotic Ser/Thr protein kinases and the conserved sequence of eIF-2alpha kinases in subdomain V. A large insert of 94 amino acids, which is characteristic of eIF-2alpha kinases, is also present between subdomains IV and V. It is particularly notable that DGCN2 possesses an amino acid sequence related to class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, a unique feature of yeast GCN2 protein kinase. DGCN2 expression is developmentally regulated. During embryogenesis, DGCN2 mRNA is dynamically expressed in several tissues. Interestingly, at later stages this expression becomes restricted to a few cells of the central nervous system.

By drawing comparisons with published cladograms of species relatedness, three conclusions regarding the evolutionary history of the MOL are made: (i) The MOL predates the major radiations of the genus Drosophila, given its presence in earlier-branching Chymomyza and Scaptodrosophila; the MOL has been subsequently excluded in at least one present species of each of these two primitive genera. (ii) Within the genus Drosophila the MOL is present sporadically in the radiation of the subgenus Sophophora, showing repetitive loss even in very close evolutionary lineages.

Molecular organization of the glutathione reductase gene in Drosophila melanogaster,9056265,10.1006/abbi.1996.9872,"Glutathione reductase catalyzes the conversion of the oxidized form of glutathione to regenerate reduced glutathione, which acts as a versatile intracellular reductant. The present study provides initial characterization of the glutathione reductase gene in Drosophila melanogaster and its response to experimentally induced oxidative stress. Drosophila cDNA clones were isolated, based on cross-hybridization to the Musca domestica glutathione reductase cDNA. Genomic clones were isolated by cross-hybridization with the Drosophila cDNA as hybridization probe. Northern analysis of adult Drosophila poly(A)+ RNA, utilizing the Drosophila cDNA probe, revealed a hybridization signal in the 2-kb range. The entire sequence of one cDNA was determined. In addition to a coding domain of 1431 bases, the sequence included 206 bases upstream of a putative start codon and 355 bases downstream of a putative stop codon. Based on the cDNA sequence, the 476 amino acid sequence of the Drosophila glutathione reductase gene was deduced and was found to have extensive similarities with the glutathione reductase gene from other species. Gene mapping of a 13-kb genomic fragment revealed that the glutathione reductase gene consists of at least two exons spanning approximately 5 kb. A first exon contains sequence for only the first 5 amino acids and the first base of the sixth and appears to be separated by a ca. 2.5-kb intron from the remainder of the coding region, which is confined to <2 kb. The Drosophila glutathione reductase is single copy and its cytogenetic position, as determined by in situ hybridization, is 7D-E on the X chromosome. mRNA levels of glutathione reductase, measured by RT-PCR, increased in response to exposure to 100% ambient oxygen by almost twofold and administration of paraquat by greater than threefold. Exposure of flies to hyperoxia also induced a 60% increase in the activity of glutathione reductase and augmented the concentration of total glutathione by ca. 40% following an initial drop.

Physiological mechanisms of evolved desiccation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,9225453,,"We investigated physiological characters associated with water balance in laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster selected for resistance to desiccating conditions for over 100 generations. Five replicate, outbred, desiccation-selected (D) populations were compared with their control (C) populations. Water loss rates of female D flies were approximately 40% lower than those of C females. Although excretory water loss was reduced in desiccation-selected flies, it comprised less than 10% of total water loss, indicating that the D populations have evolved reduced cuticular and/or respiratory water loss rates. Total surface lipid amounts did not differ between the C and D flies. Cuticular hydrocarbons from D flies were longer than those from C flies and melted at slightly higher temperatures, possibly contributing to reduced water loss rates. Desiccation-selected flies contained approximately 30% more bulk water than controls, as well as more glycogen. However, total metabolic water stores did not differ between the stocks owing to higher lipid levels in the C populations. The ability to tolerate water loss, as measured by water content at the time of death, did not differ between D and C flies.

The effect of dominant vestigial alleles upon vestigial-mediated wing patterning during development of Drosophila melanogaster,9347912,10.1016/s0925-4773(97)00096-8,"The vestigial gene product is required for the completion of wing development in Drosophila melanogaster. In the absence of vestigial gene expression, cells within the larval wing and haltere imaginal discs fail to proliferate normally thus producing adults with severely reduced wings. Of a large number of vestigial mutations that have been characterized, only two are currently known to exist, vestigial(U) and vestigial(W), which manifest a significant dominant phenotype. Both are associated with chromosomal inversions that fuse the majority of the vestigial coding regions to other genes; mastermind in vestigial(U) and invected in vestigial(W) Examination of vestigial expression in the presence of these dominant alleles shows alterations in the disc-specific expression of vestigial during later stages of larval development. These patterning disruptions are specific to cells of the wing imaginal disc, as significant suppression of total levels of vestigial expression within entire larvae could not be detected. This dominant interference of vestigial patterning appears to be mediated in part by the vestigial coding sequences that are within the gene fusions. Further evidence that the dominant phenotype is the result of disrupted vestigial patterning comes from observations that the dominant alleles can be partially suppressed by mutations within the Drosophila-epidermal growth factor receptor gene. Mutagenesis of vestigial(U) and vestigial(W) produced a series of alleles with partially dominant phenotypes that restored various amounts of the adult wing. These phenotypes can be correlated with alterations in specific portions of the vestigial sequences associated with the dominant alleles. In the presence of these partially dominant alleles, wing imaginal discs have significantly more cells which express vestigial compared with the number associated with the original dominant phenotype. Additionally, eliminating some of the dominant effect causes alterations in the patterns of early stage apoptotic cell death associated with dominant vestigial alleles. Utilizing these new vestigial alleles, it is possible to correlate the consequence of altered vestigial expression to subsequent changes in patterning of the wing disc.",1997,"A Simmonds, S Hughes, J Tse, S Cocquyt, J Bell, A Simmonds, S Hughes, J Tse, S Cocquyt, J Bell"

The results were as follows: (1) All substitution lines appear normal in viability and fertility in both sexes, indicating no strong postmating isolation. (2) The genes for the behaviors are mapped to all three major chromosomes with the same ranking and comparable magnitude of effects for both sexes: III > II >> X > or = 0 (III, II and X designate the effects of the three chromosomes). The results suggest less evolution on the X than on autosomes at loci of sexual behavior. (3) The genes for ""Z-maleness"" are many and somewhat redundant. Whole-chromosome effects for Z-maleness appear nearly additive and show little dominance. (4) In contrast, ""Z-femaleness"" has less redundancy as partial genotypes never exhibit full phenotypic effects. Epistatic interactions and incomplete dominance can sometimes be detected.

The study of ZAM's genomic distribution by FISH mapping analysis to salivary gland polytene chromosomes or on mitotic chromosomes indicates that most of the insertion sites of ZAM elements are associated with the constitutive heterochromatin regardless of the ZAM copy number. In addition, our results suggest that multiple ZAM elements are present at the insertion sites visualized by in situ experiments.",1997,"E Baldrich, P Dimitri, S Desset, P Leblanc, D Codipietro, C Vaury, E Baldrich, P Dimitri, S Desset, P Leblanc, D Codipietro, C Vaury"
DNA polymerase epsilon from Drosophila melanogaster,9016770,10.1006/bbrc.1996.5945,"We identified a DNA polymerase species in Drosophila melanogaster embryos, and purified it. This polymerase shared some common properties with DNA polymerase epsilon from mammals and yeast as follows; it has a preference for poly(dA)/oligo(dT) as a template/primer, it is highly processive in DNA synthesis, it co-fractionates with 3'-5' exonuclease activity, it is sensitive to aphidicolin and is resistance to ddTTP. The polymerase activity was inhibited in the immuno-precipitation assay with anti-pol-epsilon antibodies, which were produced against a polypeptide coded on the cDNA of a putative Drosophila pol-epsilon we isolated previously. Using these antibodies, Western blot analysis revealed that this polymerase is a 250kDa polypeptide, which is the same size as observed in mammals and yeast. These results indicate that Drosophila produces the epsilon-class of DNA polymerase, and like mammals or yeast, possesses the 5 typical classes of DNA polymerases (alpha to epsilon) in its embryos.",1997,"N Aoyagi, M Oshige, F Hirose, K Kuroda, A Matsukage, K Sakaguchi, N Aoyagi, M Oshige, F Hirose, K Kuroda, A Matsukage, K Sakaguchi"
Reaper-induced apoptosis in a vertebrate system,9405366,10.1093/emboj/16.24.7372,"The reaper protein of Drosophila melanogaster has been shown to be a central regulator of apoptosis in that organism. However, it has not been shown to function in any vertebrate nor have the cellular components required for its action been defined. In this report we show that reaper can induce rapid apoptosis in vitro using an apoptotic reconstitution system derived from Xenopus eggs. Moreover, we show that a subcellular fraction enriched in mitochondria is required for this process and that reaper, acting in conjunction with cytosolic factors, can trigger mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Bcl-2 antagonizes these effects, but high levels of reaper can overcome the Bcl-2 block. These results demonstrate that reaper can function in a vertebrate context, suggesting that reaper-responsive factors are conserved elements of the apoptotic program.",1997,"E K Evans, T Kuwana, S L Strum, J J Smith, D D Newmeyer, S Kornbluth, E K Evans, T Kuwana, S L Strum, J J Smith, D D Newmeyer, S Kornbluth"

Mutations in the modifier of mdg4 [mod(mdg4)] interfere with insulation and enhance the effect of the su(Hw)-binding region inserted in the y2 mutation by inhibiting the function of regulatory elements located on both sides of the su(Hw)-binding region. From P-M hybrid dysgenic crosses, 21 mutations that suppress the negative effect of the mod(mdg4)1u1 mutation on the y2 allele were obtained among 47,000 flies scored. These Su(mg) mutations have a dominant suppressor effect and map to at least 13 different loci. Some of Su(mg) mutations also suppress the effect of mod(mdg4)1u1 on two other gypsy-induced mutations, scD1 and ct6.

Two oligonucleotides, corresponding to the BR 2.1 and IRP1A genes, were used as primers and the whole procedure was performed within 3-4 h. The strong labelling with low background revealed the localization of the BR 2.1 gene in polytene chromosome IV of C. tentans and the IRP1A gene in polytene chromosome 3R83 of D. melanogaster.

Characterization of the EstP protein in Drosophila melanogaster and its conservation in drosophilids,9435945,10.1023/a:1021897016276,"The beta-esterase cluster of D. melanogaster comprises two tandemly duplicated genes. Est6 encodes the well-characterized 5' gene, but the product of the second gene, denoted EstP, had not previously been identified. Here we show that the EstP gene encodes the carboxylesterase EST7. Expression of EstP using the Baculovirus system led to production of a carboxylesterase biochemically indistinguishable from EST7. Furthermore, a naturally occurring EstP variant produces greatly reduced amounts of EstP mRNA and no detectable EST7 protein. Finally, introduction of a wild-type copy of EstP by germline transformation into the variant strain confers the wild-type EST7 phenotype. We show that EST7 differs from EST6 in its substrate and inhibitor specificities and tissue distribution. Germline transformation experiments show that EstP expression is controlled by sequences located between 192 bp 5' and 609 bp 3' of the EstP coding region. Data comparisons with other drosophilid esterases suggest that the site of expression and hence the function, of EST7 has been conserved across lineages in both the subgenera Drosophila and Sophophora.",1997,"M M Dumancic, J G Oakeshott, R J Russell, M J Healy, M M Dumancic, J G Oakeshott, R J Russell, M J Healy"

Olfactory coding in a compound nose. Coexpression of odorant-binding proteins in Drosophila,9929625,10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb10588.x,"Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are small, soluble proteins present in the aqueous medium surrounding olfactory receptor neurons. Their function in olfaction is unknown: they have been proposed to facilitate the transit of hydrophobic molecules to olfactory receptors, to deactivate the odorant stimulus, and/or to play a role in chemosensory coding. We have examined the genomic organization and expression patterns of two olfactory-specific genes (OS-E and OS-F) of Drosophila melanogaster, the products of which are members of a protein family in Drosophila sharing sequence similarity with moth OBPs. We found that the OS-E and OS-F transcription units are located < 1 kb apart. They are oriented in the same direction and display a similar intron-exon organization. Expression of both OS-E and OS-F proteins is spatially restricted to the ventrolateral region of the Drosophila antenna. Within this region, both OS-E and OS-F proteins are expressed within two different types of sensory hairs: in most, if not all, sensilla trichodea and in approximately 40% of the interspersed small sensilla basiconica. We consistently observe that OS-E and OS-F are coexpressed, indicating that an individual sensillum can contain more than one odorant-binding protein.

The cohesion protein MEI-S332 localizes to condensed meiotic and mitotic centromeres until sister chromatids separate,9490715,10.1083/jcb.140.5.1003,"The Drosophila MEI-S332 protein has been shown to be required for the maintenance of sister-chromatid cohesion in male and female meiosis. The protein localizes to the centromeres during male meiosis when the sister chromatids are attached, and it is no longer detectable after they separate. Drosophila melanogaster male meiosis is atypical in several respects, making it important to define MEI-S332 behavior during female meiosis, which better typifies meiosis in eukaryotes. We find that MEI-S332 localizes to the centromeres of prometaphase I chromosomes in oocytes, remaining there until it is delocalized at anaphase II. By using oocytes we were able to obtain sufficient material to investigate the fate of MEI-S332 after the metaphase II-anaphase II transition. The levels of MEI-S332 protein are unchanged after the completion of meiosis, even when translation is blocked, suggesting that the protein dissociates from the centromeres but is not degraded at the onset of anaphase II. Unexpectedly, MEI-S332 is present during embryogenesis, localizes onto the centromeres of mitotic chromosomes, and is delocalized from anaphase chromosomes. Thus, MEI-S332 associates with the centromeres of both meiotic and mitotic chromosomes and dissociates from them at anaphase.",1998,"D P Moore, A W Page, T T Tang, A W Kerrebrock, T L Orr-Weaver, D P Moore, A W Page, T T Tang, A W Kerrebrock, T L Orr-Weaver"
mei-W68 in Drosophila melanogaster encodes a Spo11 homolog: evidence that the mechanism for initiating meiotic recombination is conserved,9744869,10.1101/gad.12.18.2932,"Meiotic recombination requires the action of several gene products in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic studies in D. melanogaster have shown that the mei-W68 gene is required for all meiotic gene conversion and crossing-over. We cloned mei-W68 using a new genetic mapping method in which P elements are used to promote crossing-over at their insertion sites. This resulted in the high-resolution mapping of mei-W68 to a <18-kb region that contains a homolog of the S. cerevisiae spo11 gene. Molecular analysis of several mutants confirmed that mei-W68 encodes an spo11 homolog. Spo11 and MEI-W68 are members of a family of proteins similar to a novel type II topoisomerase. On the basis of this and other lines of evidence, Spo11 has been proposed to be the enzymatic activity that creates the double-strand breaks needed to initiate meiotic recombination. This raises the possibility that recombination in Drosophila is also initiated by double-strand breaks. Although these homologous genes are required absolutely for recombination in both species, their roles differ in other respects. In contrast to spo11, mei-W68 is not required for synaptonemal complex formation and does have a mitotic role.",1998,"K S McKim, A Hayashi-Hagihara, K S McKim, A Hayashi-Hagihara"

Functional analysis of eve stripe 2 enhancer evolution in Drosophila: rules governing conservation and change,9449677,,"Experimental investigations of eukaryotic enhancers suggest that multiple binding sites and trans-acting regulatory factors are often required for wild-type enhancer function. Genetic analysis of the stripe 2 enhancer of even-skipped (eve), an important developmental gene in Drosophila, provides support for this view. Given the importance of even-skipped expression in early Drosophila development, it might be predicted that many structural features of the stripe 2 enhancer will be evolutionarily conserved, including the DNA sequences of protein binding sites and the spacing between them. To test this hypothesis, we compared sequences of the stripe 2 enhancer between four species of Drosophila: D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. erecta and D. pseudoobscura. Our analysis revealed a large number of nucleotide substitutions in regulatory protein binding sites for bicoid, hunchback, Kruppel and giant, as well as a systematic change in the size of the enhancer. Some of the binding sites in D. melanogaster are either absent or modified in other species. One functionally important bicoid-binding site in D. melanogaster appears to be recently evolved. We, therefore, investigated possible functional consequences of sequence differences among these stripe 2 enhancers by P-element-mediated transformation. This analysis revealed that the eve stripe 2 enhancer from each of the four species drove reporter gene expression at the identical time and location in D. melanogaster embryos. Double staining of native eve protein and transgene mRNA in early embryos showed that the reporter gene mimicked native eve expression and, in every case, produced sharply defined stripes at the blastoderm stage that were coincident with eve stripe 2 protein. We argue that stripe 2 eve expression in Drosophila evolution can be viewed as being under constant stabilizing selection with respect to the location of the anterior and posterior borders of the stripe. We further hypothesize that the stripe 2 enhancer is functionally robust, so that its evolution may be governed by the fixation of both slightly deleterious and adaptive mutations in regulatory protein binding sites as well as in the spacing between binding sites. This view allows for a slow but continual turnover of functionally important changes in the stripe 2 enhancer.",1998,"M Z Ludwig, N H Patel, M Kreitman, M Z Ludwig, N H Patel, M Kreitman"
Key aspects of the primary sex determination mechanism are conserved across the genus Drosophila,9671597,,"In D. melanogaster, a set of 'X:A numerator genes', which includes sisterlessA (sisA), determines sex by controlling the transcription of Sex-lethal (Sxl). We characterized sisA from D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis and studied the timing of sisA and Sxl expression with single cell-cycle resolution in D. virilis, both to guide structure-function studies of sisA and to help understand sex determination evolution. We found that D. virilis sisA shares 58% amino acid identity with its melanogaster ortholog. The identities confirm sisA as an atypical bZIP transcription factor. Although virilis sisA can substitute for melanogaster sisA, the protein is not fully functional in a heterologous context. The putative sisA regulatory sequence CAGGTAG is a potential 'numerator box,' since it is shared with the other strong X:A numerator gene, sisB, and its target, SxlPe. Temporal and spatial features of sisA and SxlPe expression are strikingly conserved, including rapid onset and cessation of transcription in somatic nuclei, early cessation of sisA transcription in budding pole cells and persistent high-level sisA expression in yolk nuclei. Expression of sisA and Sxl is as tightly coupled in virilis as it is in melanogaster. Taken together, these data indicate that the same primary sex determination mechanism exists throughout the genus Drosophila.",1998,"J W Erickson, T W Cline, J W Erickson, T W Cline"

The GFS has been intensively studied physiologically in both wild-type and mutant flies, and is often used as a system to study the effects of neural mutations on the physiology of the adult nervous system. Recently, much information has been gleaned as to how and when synaptogenesis, with its major target neurons, is achieved. However, little is known of the earlier development of this neuron. Here we have used an enhancer-trap, marking parts of the GFS, in conjunction with BrdU labelling, to attempt to follow the birth, axonogenesis, and the early morphological meeting of the GFs with their target neurons. From these anatomical observations we propose that the GF cell is not born during the larval or pupal stages and, therefore. appears to be a persistent embryonic cell. The axons of the GFs develop during the third instar. During the early pupal stages the GFs contact other identified neurons of the GFS. In addition, we see some aberrant development of the network, with some flies carrying only one GF, and yet others with extended axons.

In the present paper, the patterns of expression of DSP1 protein and RNA in adult flies and during development are reported. In the adults DSP1 protein is located in nurse cells of ovaries and in brain. During eggs development uniform expression of DSP1 protein persists until the end of germband retraction. At later stages, expression is restricted to the ventral nerve chord and brain. Using P-element mutagenesis, we have isolated a mutant deficient in DSP1 functions.

Age-dependent accumulation of advanced glycation end-products in adult Drosophila melanogaster,9578111,10.1016/s0047-6374(97)00146-2,"Advanced glycation end-product(s) (AGE) are formed in biological systems when reducing sugars react with amino groups on proteins. Long-lived proteins such as collagen and lens crystallins are known to be susceptible to AGE modification and may play a major role in the development of diabetes and other age-related pathologies. It has been previously suggested that AGE formation might affect the lifespan of experimental animals. Our study is the first to examine the effect of AGE accumulation on the life span of an organism, Drosophila melanogaster. We found that Drosophila melanogaster maintained at 24 degrees C accumulate significant AGE over their lifespan. Young flies (10 days old) had 44% less AGE than senescent flies (75 days old). We were able to reduce AGE accumulation in Drosophila melanogaster by raising the flies on a medium containing a known AGE inhibitor, aminoguanidine HCl. Reduction of AGE in flies failed to increase their mean lifespan, and high concentrations (40 mM) reduced the mean life span, which suggests that aminoguanidine is toxic at levels near those required for inhibition of AGE formation. However, the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, provides a simple model system to study the age-dependent accumulation of glycated proteins and their inhibition by novel compounds.",1998,"A J Oudes, C M Herr, Y Olsen, J E Fleming, A J Oudes, C M Herr, Y Olsen, J E Fleming"
Neocentromere activity of structurally acentric mini-chromosomes in Drosophila,9425896,10.1038/ng0198-30,"Chromosome fragments that lack centromeric DNA (structurally acentric chromosomes) are usually not inherited in mitosis and meiosis. We previously described the isolation, after irradiation of a Drosophila melanogaster mini-chromosome, of structurally acentric mini-chromosomes that display efficient mitotic and meiotic transmission despite their small size (under 300 kb) and lack of centromeric DNA. Here we report that these acentric mini-chromosomes bind the centromere-specific protein ZW10 and associate with the spindle poles in anaphase. The sequences in these acentric mini-chromosomes were derived from the tip of the X chromosome, which does not display centromere activity or localize ZW10, even when separated from the rest of the X. We conclude that the normally non-centromeric DNAs present in these acentric mini-chromosomes have acquired centromere function, and suggest that this example of 'neocentromere' formation involves appropriation of a self-propagating centromeric chromatin structure.

To determine if germinal revertants were induced by precise excision of the insertional element we analysed several phenotypic revertants using PCR and Southern blot techniques. The results indicate that, under our experimental conditions, the mutagens used did not induce excision of B104 in the white gene.

RESOURCE ACQUISITION AND THE EVOLUTION OF STRESS RESISTANCE IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,28565385,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1998.tb02016.x,"Resistance to environmental stress is one of the most important forces molding the distribution and abundance of species. We investigated the evolution of desiccation stress resistance using 20 outbred Drosophila melanogaster populations directly selected in the laboratory for adult desiccation resistance (D), postponed senescence (O), and their respective controls (C and B). Both aging and desiccation selection increased desiccation resistance relative to their controls, creating a spectrum of desiccation resistance levels across selection treatments. We employed an integrative approach, merging data on the life histories of these populations with a detailed physiology of water balance. The physiological basis of desiccation resistance may be mechanisms enhancing either resource conservation or resource acquisition and allocation. Desiccation-resistant populations had increased water and carbohydrate stores, and showed age-specific patterns of desiccation resistance consistent with the resource accumulation mechanism. A significant proportion of the resources relevant to resistance of the stress were accumulated in the larval stage. Males and females of desiccation-selected lines exhibited distinctly different patterns of desiccation resistance and resource acquisition, in a manner suggesting intersexual antagonism in the evolution of stress resistance. Preadult viability of stress-selected populations was lower than that of controls, and development was slowed.

In the study reported here, a set of genetically defined lines of Drosophila melanogaster were exposed to four stresses (acetic acid, ethanol, starvation and thermal stress) in order to assess the magnitude of environmental effects and genotype x environment interactions. In addition to scoring metabolic traits, distributions of survival times under each stress were also quantified. Although both metabolic traits and survival times exhibited strong differences among genotypes, the correlations between enzyme traits and survival were generally weak.

A single parasitoid segregating factor controls immune suppression in Drosophila,9703687,10.1093/jhered/89.4.306,"Encapsulation has evolved as an efficient mechanism whereby an insect host can survive infection by parasitoids This ability is controlled by a major gene in Drosophila melanogaster hosts. The parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi (Hymenoptera Eucoilidae) can suppress the Drosophila immune reaction by injecting viruslike particles. Analysis of Mendelian crosses between strains of L. boulardi of opposite immune suppressive abilities indicated that the trait is controlled by a single chromosomal factor with semidominant effect. We developed a method to test the monogenic hypothesis. The range of possible genotypic values in back-crosses was studied using various progeny that were genotypically homogenous. These could be obtained because of the arrhenotokous mode of reproduction. The progeny groups were divided into two clusters according to the major gene classification and the hypothesis of another unlinked genetic factor was rejected. Lastly, there was a residual progeny effect within the major groups, indicating that minor genes are also present. This study rules out the polygenic effect for a trait governing the interaction between the insect and parasitoid. It demonstrates that the gene-for-gene model commonly found in plant-parasite interactions may also explain natural variations in insect-parasitoid traits.",1998,"S Dupas, F Frey, Y Carton, S Dupas, F Frey, Y Carton"
Rearrangements at a hobo element inserted into the first intron of the singed gene in the unstable sn49 system of Drosophila melanogaster,9529526,10.1007/s004380050669,"The cytological structure of the X chromosome and the DNA organisation of the singed locus were examined in five singed bristle mutants of Drosophila melanogaster.

Rearrangements were found at a site within the first intron of the singed gene, where a hobo element is inserted in these mutants. One rearrangement, which is associated with a strong bristle phenotype, has an inversion between 2D and the location of singed at 7D, which separates the singed promoter from the singed coding region. Two phenotypically wild-type derivatives have smaller rearrangements within the first intron which do not appear to interfere with singed expression. Two derivatives with bristle phenotypes have more complex rearrangements, and one of them shows a dominant or antimorphic phenotype. DNA blotting and in situ hybridisation experiments show that, in addition to these rearrangements at a hobo element inserted at singed, other hobo elements in these strains have been mobilised.

Specific interactions between vestigial and scalloped are required to promote wing tissue proliferation in Drosophila melanogaster,9799424,10.1007/s004270050201,"The two genes vestigial (vg) and scalloped (sd) are required for wing development in Drosophila melanogaster. They present similar patterns of expression in second and third instar wing discs and similar wing mutant phenotypes. vg encodes a nuclear protein without any recognized nucleic acid-binding motif. Sd is a transcription factor homologous to the human TEF-1 factor whose promoter activity depends on cell-specific cofactors. We postulate that Vg could be a cofactor of Sd in the wing morphogenetic process and that, together, they could constitute a functional transcription complex. We investigated genetic interactions between the two genes. We show here that vg and sd co-operate in vivo in a manner dependent on the structure of the Vg protein. We ectopically expressed vg in the patch (ptc) domains. We show evidence that wing-like outgrowths induced by ectopic expression of vg are severely reduced in vg or sd mutant backgrounds. Accordingly, we demonstrate that ptc-GAL4-driven expression of vg induces both expressions of the endogenous vg and sd genes and that the two Vg and Sd proteins have to be produced together to promote wing proliferation. Furthermore, we show an interaction between the two proteins by double hybrid experiments in yeast. Our results therefore support the hypothesis that Sd and Vg directly interact in vivo to form a complex regulating the proliferation of wing tissue.",1998,"S Paumard-Rigal, A Zider, P Vaudin, J Silber, S Paumard-Rigal, A Zider, P Vaudin, J Silber"
Prolonged oviposition decreases the ability of the parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi to suppress the cellular immune response of its host Drosophila melanogaster,9603493,10.1006/expr.1998.4270,"The cellular immune response of Drosophila against metazoan parasites is characterized by the production of melanotic capsules comprised mostly of host blood cells (hemocytes). During the latter part of the ovipositional period of the cynipid wasp parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi, eggs are deposited into host larvae of Drosophila melanogaster that are more susceptible to destruction by melanotic encapsulation than are eggs laid earlier. The increase in parasitoid mortality is attributed to a decline in the wasp's ability to suppress the host immune response. The decrease in active immune suppression is dependent on the reproductive physiology of the wasp, and this correlates with the extent of her prior ovipositional experience and not on her chronological age nor on the number of eggs remaining in the ovarioles. Such females with prior ovipositional experience which lack the ability to immune suppress infect far fewer hosts than females with no prior ovipositional experience. The reluctance of experienced wasps to infect hosts is not due to egg depletion, but instead is attributed to a depletion in immune suppressive substances. Perhaps by ovipositional restraints, retaining eggs that would otherwise become encapsulated reduces selection pressure in host populations for specific immune reactivity.",1998,"E Vass, A J Nappi, E Vass, A J Nappi"
In vivo analysis of scaffold-associated regions in Drosophila: a synthetic high-affinity SAR binding protein suppresses position effect variegation,9524129,10.1093/emboj/17.7.2079,"Scaffold-associated regions (SARs) were studied in Drosophila melanogaster by expressing a synthetic, high-affinity SAR-binding protein called MATH (multi-AT-hook), which consists of reiterated AT-hook peptide motifs; each motif is known to recognize a wide variety of short AT-rich sequences. MATH proteins were expressed specifically in the larval eye imaginal discs by means of the tetracycline-regulated transactivation system and tested for their effect on position effect variegation (PEV). MATH20, a highly potent SAR ligand consisting of 20 AT-hooks, was found to suppress whitemottled 4 variegation. This suppression required MATH20 expression at an early larval developmental stage. Our data suggest an involvement of the high AT-rich SARs in higher order chromatin structure and gene expression.",1998,"F Girard, B Bello, U K Laemmli, W J Gehring, F Girard, B Bello, U K Laemmli, W J Gehring"
Stabilization of recombinant Drosophila acetylcholinesterase,9518457,10.1006/prep.1997.0831,"The uses of pure and stable acetylcholinesterase can range from simple basic research to applications in environment quality assessment. In order to satisfy some of these needs its recombinant expression is routinely performed. Affinity-purified recombinant Drosophila melanogaster acetylcholinesterase proved to be instable; an apparent cause of this seemed to be the presence of contaminants with protease activity as evidenced by SDS-PAGE. The elimination of these accompanying products was achieved by anion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and cibacron blue affinity chromatography applied downstream from procainamide affinity chromatography. The utilization of a parallel affinity acting via an engineered histidine tail permitted the elimination of the copurified proteases as well. Despite the elimination of the contaminants, the apparently pure extracts were still unstable. It is shown that such instability can be counterbalanced by provoking protein-protein interactions, either between enzyme molecules or with other molecules such as bovine serum albumin. Another way to reduce instability is the addition of a reversible inhibitor or polyethylene glycol 3350.",1998,"S Estrada-Mondaca, D Fournier, S Estrada-Mondaca, D Fournier"
Drosophila P[Gal4] lines reveal that motor neurons involved in feeding persist through metamorphosis,9805270,,"Two P[Gal4] insertion lines in Drosophila melanogaster, MT11 and MT26, express GAL4 specifically in two to three pairs of pharyngeal motor neurons (PMN) in the suboesophageal ganglion. By using various secondary reporters, the architecture of the PMN, including their efferent axons in the pharyngeal nerve, was visualized. This allowed us to identify a pharyngeal dilator muscle as their target. To study the function of these neurons, we crossed line MT11 with a UAS-tetanus toxin gene construct (TNT-C) that inhibits all synaptic transmission. The offspring shows a reduction in food ingestion of 75% compared to the MT11 and TNT-C controls, demonstrating that PMN control food uptake. More important, lines MT11 and MT26 enabled us to follow PMN and their processes through metamorphosis, since labeling appears in the late third larval instar and persists up to adulthood. The motor axons innervate a pharyngeal muscle in the larva as well and extend through the maxillary nerve, proving that this nerve is homologous to the adult pharyngeal nerve. Efferent arborizations persist throughout metamorphosis, even though the larval muscle histolyzes by 20% of pupal life. Yet, some dedifferentiated structures remain, which may serve as a template for the formation of the adult muscle. Labeling of line MT26 with bromodeoxyuridine at embryonic or larval stages suggests that these neurons undergo their terminal mitosis in the mid to late embryo.",1998,"M Tissot, N Gendre, R F Stocker, M Tissot, N Gendre, R F Stocker"
The gastrulation defective gene of Drosophila melanogaster is a member of the serine protease superfamily,9618496,10.1073/pnas.95.12.6819,"The establishment of dorsal-ventral polarity in the oocyte involves two sets of genes. One set belongs to the gurken-torpedo signaling pathway and affects the development of the egg chorion as well as the polarity of the embryo. The second set of genes affects only the dorsal-ventral polarity of the embryo but not the eggshell. gastrulation defective is one of the earliest acting of this second set of maternally required genes. We have cloned and characterized the gastrulation defective gene and determined that it encodes a protein structurally related to the serine protease superfamily, which also includes the Snake, Easter, and Nudel proteins. These data provide additional support for the involvement of a protease cascade in generating an asymmetric signal (i.e., asymmetric SpÃ¤tzle activity) during establishment of dorsal-ventral polarity in the Drosophila embryo.",1998,"K D Konrad, T J Goralski, A P Mahowald, J L Marsh, K D Konrad, T J Goralski, A P Mahowald, J L Marsh"
