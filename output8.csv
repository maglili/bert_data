High rate of movement of one (mdg3) out of four transposable elements in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster,7994610,,"We have analysed by in situ hybridization the insertion site polymorphism of the copia, mdg1, mdg3, and P transposable elements in diploid genomes of wild males from a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster. The values of observed average degree of individual heterozygosity for all elements except mdg3 deviate statistically from the values expected by site frequencies, revealing a tendency toward homozygosity as if drift or a structuration in the population was operating. The high degree of heterozygosity for mdg3 which in addition does not deviate from the expected value, suggests that recent high rate of movements has strongly countered the population host effect on this element. Hence, heterozygosity for TEs may well reflect the history of the population, and reveals temporary high rate of site movement existing in natural populations.",1994,"C Biémont, F Lemeunier, C Gautier, M Garcia Guerreiro, S Aulard, E G Pasyukova, C Biémont, F Lemeunier, C Gautier, M Garcia Guerreiro, S Aulard, E G Pasyukova"

The deletions obtained include small aberrations within region 2A and larger lesions extending from 2A into 1E and 1B. All three screens also yielded terminal deficiencies. The new deficiencies, together with previously characterized rearrangements, were analyzed for their complementation behaviour with the maternal effect locus fs(1) Nasrat and lethal loci in the region.

A transcription unit designated L12, which is active in the second larval instar and capable of encoding a putative protein of 28.5 kDa, lies immediately downstream from LSP1-alpha. We have determined that L12 is dosage compensated by measuring the steady-state level of its transcript in male and female larvae.

A novel eye morphology induced by a P element in somatic tissue of Drosophila melanogaster,1648167,10.1007/BF00259669,"We found a specific eye morphology designated as Square, which is induced when some Drosophila melanogaster strains harboring P elements are crossed with the delta 2-3 strain carrying a modified P element, P[ry+, delta 2-3], which produces transposase in somatic tissue. This phenotype was dominant and also induced in the reciprocal crosses. Square was induced when the delta 2-3 strain was crossed with Q and M' strains such as the snw (M) strain carrying three small P elements but not with P strains. Inheritance of Square was also tested and its phenotype was not transmitted to the next generation.

"Evidence for retrotransposition of the I factor, a LINE element of Drosophila melanogaster",1647020,10.1073/pnas.88.11.4907,"LINEs are transposable elements found in various eukaryotes such as plants, protists, insects, and mammals. Their transposition is usually difficult to study, particularly in humans, where some diseases have been shown to result from LINE insertion mutations. This is due to the fact that most copies of any particular family of elements are defective and that their transposition frequency is low. By contrast, the I factor of Drosophila melanogaster transposes at high frequency during I-R hybrid dysgenesis and is a good model for studying the LINE element superfamily. LINEs encode putative polypeptides showing similarities with viral reverse transcriptases but, unlike viral retrotransposons, they do not have terminal repeats and their ability to transpose by reverse transcription has previously only been inferred from structural analysis. Here we present direct evidence for LINE retrotransposition. Transposition of an I factor marked by an intron resulted in accurate removal of the intron.",1991,"A Pélisson, D J Finnegan, A Bucheton, A Pélisson, D J Finnegan, A Bucheton"

Their transposition is activated at high frequencies during I-R hybrid dysgenesis and is associated with the production of mutations of various sorts. Very few of these mutations have been studied at the molecular level; those reported so far result either from chromosomal rearrangements or from insertions of complete I factors. We have analysed three I-R induced yellow mutations and have found that one of them is due to the insertion of an I element very similar to the complete I factor, whereas the other two are due to insertions of I elements that are truncated at their 5' ends; one of them exhibits an unusual 3' end.

We then observed gynandromorphs with female genitalia to determine whether the sex mosaics elicited at least the minimum amount of courtship and, if so, whether they copulated. By analyzing these gynandromorphs, in which the genotype of external and internal tissues could be ascertained, we were able to identify a group of cells in the dorsal anterior brain that, when bilaterally female, is necessary and sufficient for receptivity to copulation.

The pattern of campaniform sensilla on the wing and haltere of Drosophila melanogaster and several of its homeotic mutants,6818316,,"A detailed mapping and description of campaniform sensilla on the wing and haltere of Drosophila melanogaster is provided. Six types of sensilla are distinguished. Similarities in the pattern of their distribution on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of each appendage, as well as between the wing and haltere, are apparent. These data are used to assess the quality of homeotic transformation in several mutants of the bithorax complex in which the halteres are transformed into wings. Flies homozygous for abxbx3pbx produce a complete inventory of wing sensilla on the homeotic appendage. In abx, bx3 and bx3pbx homozygotes the transformation of haltere into wing is incomplete, and each mutant shows characteristic fields of haltere and wing sensilla. It appears that specific regions of the anterior haltere compartment require different combinations of mutant alleles to produce a distinct homeotic transformation.

Multiple pheromone system controlling mating in Drosophila melanogaster,813229,10.1073/pnas.73.2.591,"The signals essential to Drosophila melanogaster courtship include pheromones emitted by the female which stimulate the male to court and pheromones emitted by the courting male which stimulate the female to accept. Genetic variation among these phermones is a common (if not universal) requirement for stimulation of either sex. The signal from the courting male to the female involves both a volatile and a nonvolatile component. The volatile component is associated with loci on the second and/or third chromosomes, while the monvolatile component is associated with the X and/or fourth chromosomes. This widespread distribution in the genome of loci controlling various components in the communication network inevitably results in linkage associations with other loci. The genetic array of gametes was limited. When combined with the negative assortitative mating pattern produced by the stimulation by dissimilar pheromones, linkage disequilibrium creates a strong counterforce to inbreeding during population bottlenecks.",1976,"W W Averhoff, R H Richardson, W W Averhoff, R H Richardson"
[Snythesis of mucoprotein secretion in the salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster IIIrd instar larvae],814516,,"The process of mucoprotein (glue) accumulation is described. This substance is secreted by salivary glands of the III instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster. Granules of the secretory substance appear in the glandular cells 90 hrs after egg laying. Its secretion takes place within 120 hrs. The template RNA of glue proteins appears to be synthesized within the range of 72-85 hrs since actinomycin treatment of larvae at this time suppresses the formation of secretory substance. The portion of secretory proteins amounts to 23-32% of the total gland protein. In a mutant, 13tl, deficient by the absence of pupation, no PAS-positive, staining of glands or secretory granules identified under the phase-contrast microscope was found. A possible participation of fat body in the formation of mucoprotein secretory substance is discussed.",1975,"N N Kolesnikov, I F Zhimulev, N N Kolesnikov, I F Zhimulev"
Regulation of ribosomal RNA and 5s RNA synthesis in Drosophila melanogaster. I. Bobbed mutants,4630583,,"Analysis of the rates and amounts of rRNA and 5s RNA synthesized in Drosophila melanogaster bobbed mutants was done by using acrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The results show that the amounts of rRNA synthesized are constant, although the rates of rRNA synthesis in bb's are reduced to 30% of the wild-type level. The rates of synthesis of 5s RNA were constant. The rate of synthesis of the two kinds of molecules that enter in equimolar amounts into the mature ribosome is non-coordinated.-The rates of rRNA synthesis were shown to be proportional to the length of the scutellar bristles, supporting the notion that in trichogen cells there is no developmental delay, but the size of the bristle depends directly on the rate of rRNA synthesis.",1972,"R Weinmann, R Weinmann"

Genetic heterogeneity among the founders of laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster : V. Sternopleural and abdominal chaetae in the same strains,24435942,10.1007/BF00285409,"1. Single inseminated females of Drosophila melanogaster derived from the same population led to discrete strains for both Sternopleural and abdominal chaeta number in agreement with other work, which indicates that the wild populations have genes polymorphic for these traits. Variability varied significantly between strains for Sternopleural but not abdominal chaeta number. 2. Overall, the data show a weak correlation between the two traits. Considering this by strain, the correlations go from negative (but not significantly < 0) to positive (but significantly > 0). Therefore just as the rate of response to directional selection has been shown to be extremely rapid when based on strains extreme in the direction of the required selection response, it seems that a similar process may be useful for directional selection based on two traits simultaneously, by using only those strains showing a positive correlation.",1970,"P A Parsons, P A Parsons"
SETD3 protein is the actin-specific histidine N-methyltransferase,30526847,10.7554/eLife.37921,"Protein histidine methylation is a rare post-translational modification of unknown biochemical importance. In vertebrates, only a few methylhistidine-containing proteins have been reported, including β-actin as an essential example. The evolutionary conserved methylation of β-actin H73 is catalyzed by an as yet unknown histidine N-methyltransferase. We report here that the protein SETD3 is the actin-specific histidine N-methyltransferase. In vitro, recombinant rat and human SETD3 methylated β-actin at H73. Knocking-out SETD3 in both human HAP1 cells and in Drosophila melanogaster resulted in the absence of methylation at β-actin H73 in vivo, whereas β-actin from wildtype cells or flies was > 90% methylated. As a consequence, we show that Setd3-deficient HAP1 cells have less cellular F-actin and an increased glycolytic phenotype.

Most have focused on cell-intrinsic gene functions and mechanisms. Much less is known about how transformed, or otherwise functionally disrupted, cells interact with healthy ones toward a favorable or pathological outcome. This is largely due to technical limitations. We developed new genetic tools in Drosophila melanogaster that permit efficient multiplexed gain- and loss-of-function genetic perturbations with separable spatial and temporal control. Importantly, our novel tool-set is independent of the commonly used GAL4/UAS system, freeing the latter for additional, non-autonomous, genetic manipulations; and is built into a single strain, allowing one-generation interrogation of non-autonomous effects. Altogether, our design opens up efficient genome-wide screens on any deleterious phenotype, once plasmid or genome engineering is used to place the desired miRNA(s) or ORF(s) into our genotype.

"Disruption of INOS, a Gene Encoding myo-Inositol Phosphate Synthase, Causes Male Sterility in Drosophila melanogaster",29991509,10.1534/g3.118.200403,"Inositol is a precursor for the phospholipid membrane component phosphatidylinositol (PI), involved in signal transduction pathways, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and osmoregulation. Alterations of inositol metabolism have been implicated in human reproductive issues, the therapeutic effects of drugs used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder, spinal cord defects, and diseases including diabetes and Alzheimer's. The sole known inositol synthetic enzyme is myo-inositol synthase (MIPS), and the homolog in Drosophilia melanogaster is encoded by the Inos gene. Three identical deletion strains (inosΔDF /CyO) were constructed, confirmed by PCR and sequencing, and homozygotes (inosΔDF /inosΔDF ) were shown to lack the transcript encoding the MIPS enzyme. Without inositol, homozygous inosΔDF deletion fertilized eggs develop only to the first-instar larval stage. When transferred as pupae to food without inositol, however, inosΔDF homozygotes die significantly sooner than wild-type flies. Even with dietary inositol the homozygous inosΔDF males are sterile. An inos allele, with a P-element inserted into the first intron, fails to complement this male sterile phenotype. An additional copy of the Inos gene inserted into another chromosome rescues all the phenotypes. These genetic and phenotypic analyses establish D. melanogaster as an excellent model organism in which to examine the role of inositol synthesis in development and reproduction.",2018,"Natasha A M Jackson, Angelina M Flores, Elizabeth D Eldon, Lisa S Klig, Natasha A M Jackson, Angelina M Flores, Elizabeth D Eldon, Lisa S Klig"
Linked genetic variation and not genome structure causes widespread differential expression associated with chromosomal inversions,29735663,10.1073/pnas.1721275115,"Chromosomal inversions are widely thought to be favored by natural selection because they suppress recombination between alleles that have higher fitness on the same genetic background or in similar environments. Nonetheless, few selected alleles have been characterized at the molecular level. Gene expression profiling provides a powerful way to identify functionally important variation associated with inversions and suggests candidate phenotypes. However, altered genome structure itself might also impact gene expression by influencing expression profiles of the genes proximal to inversion breakpoint regions or by modifying expression patterns genome-wide due to rearranging large regulatory domains. In natural inversions, genetic differentiation and genome structure are inextricably linked. Here, we characterize differential expression patterns associated with two chromosomal inversions found in natural Drosophila melanogaster populations. To isolate the impacts of genome structure, we engineered synthetic chromosomal inversions on controlled genetic backgrounds with breakpoints that closely match each natural inversion. We find that synthetic inversions have negligible effects on gene expression. Nonetheless, natural inversions have broad-reaching regulatory impacts in cis and trans Furthermore, we find that differentially expressed genes associated with both natural inversions are enriched for loci associated with immune response to bacterial pathogens. Our results support the idea that inversions in D. melanogaster experience natural selection to maintain associations between functionally related alleles to produce complex phenotypic outcomes.",2018,"Iskander Said, Ashley Byrne, Victoria Serrano, Charis Cardeno, Christopher Vollmers, Russell Corbett-Detig, Iskander Said, Ashley Byrne, Victoria Serrano, Charis Cardeno, Christopher Vollmers, Russell Corbett-Detig"
Y-linked variation for autosomal immune gene regulation has the potential to shape sexually dimorphic immunity,26631557,10.1098/rspb.2015.1301,"Sexually dimorphic phenotypes arise from the differential expression of male and female shared genes throughout the genome. Unfortunately, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which dimorphic regulation manifests and evolves are unclear. Recent work suggests that Y-chromosomes may play an important role, given that Drosophila melanogaster Ys were shown to influence the regulation of hundreds of X and autosomal genes. For Y-linked regulatory variation (YRV) to facilitate sexually dimorphic evolution, however, it must exist within populations (where selection operates) and influence male fitness. These criteria have seldom been investigated, leaving the potential for dimorphic evolution via YRV unclear. Interestingly, male and female D. melanogaster differ in immune gene regulation. Furthermore, immune gene regulation appears to be influenced by the Y-chromosome, suggesting it may contribute to dimorphic immune evolution. We address this possibility by introgressing Y-chromosomes from a single wild population into an isogenic background (to create Y-lines) and assessing immune gene regulation and bacterial defence. We found that Y-line males differed in their immune gene regulation and their ability to defend against Serratia marcescens. Moreover, gene expression and bacterial defence were positively genetically correlated. These data indicate that the Y-chromosome has the potential to shape the evolution of sexually dimorphic immunity in this system.",2015,"Ian C Kutch, Kenneth M Fedorka, Ian C Kutch, Kenneth M Fedorka"
Quantitative system drift compensates for altered maternal inputs to the gap gene network of the scuttle fly Megaselia abdita,25560971,10.7554/eLife.04785,"The segmentation gene network in insects can produce equivalent phenotypic outputs despite differences in upstream regulatory inputs between species. We investigate the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon through a systems-level analysis of the gap gene network in the scuttle fly Megaselia abdita (Phoridae). It combines quantification of gene expression at high spatio-temporal resolution with systematic knock-downs by RNA interference (RNAi). Initiation and dynamics of gap gene expression differ markedly between M. abdita and Drosophila melanogaster, while the output of the system converges to equivalent patterns at the end of the blastoderm stage. Although the qualitative structure of the gap gene network is conserved, there are differences in the strength of regulatory interactions between species.

A comparison of models to infer the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations,23341416,10.1534/genetics.112.148023,"Knowing the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new mutations is important for several topics in evolutionary genetics. Existing computational methods with which to infer the DFE based on DNA polymorphism data have frequently assumed that the DFE can be approximated by a unimodal distribution, such as a lognormal or a gamma distribution. However, if the true DFE departs substantially from the assumed distribution (e.g., if the DFE is multimodal), this could lead to misleading inferences about its properties. We conducted simulations to test the performance of parametric and nonparametric discretized distribution models to infer the properties of the DFE for cases in which the true DFE is unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal. We found that lognormal and gamma distribution models can perform poorly in recovering the properties of the distribution if the true DFE is bimodal or multimodal, whereas discretized distribution models perform better. If there is a sufficient amount of data, the discretized models can detect a multimodal DFE and can accurately infer the mean effect and the average fixation probability of a new deleterious mutation. We fitted several models for the DFE of amino acid-changing mutations using whole-genome polymorphism data from Drosophila melanogaster and the house mouse subspecies Mus musculus castaneus. A lognormal DFE best explains the data for D. melanogaster, whereas we find evidence for a bimodal DFE in M. m. castaneus.",2013,"Athanasios Kousathanas, Peter D Keightley, Athanasios Kousathanas, Peter D Keightley"
Extensive gene amplification and concerted evolution within the CPR family of cuticular proteins in mosquitoes,18510978,10.1016/j.ibmb.2008.04.001,"Annotation of the Anopheles gambiae genome has revealed a large increase in the number of genes encoding cuticular proteins with the Rebers and Riddiford Consensus (the CPR gene family) relative to Drosophila melanogaster. This increase reflects an expansion of the RR-2 group of CPR genes, particularly the amplification of sets of highly similar paralogs. Patterns of nucleotide variation indicate that extensive concerted evolution is occurring within these clusters. The pattern of concerted evolution is complex, however, as sequence similarity within clusters is uncorrelated with gene order and orientation, and no comparable clusters occur within similarly compact arrays of the RR-1 group in mosquitoes or in either group in D. melanogaster. The dearth of pseudogenes suggests that sequence clusters are maintained by selection for high gene-copy number, perhaps due to selection for high expression rates. This hypothesis is consistent with the apparently parallel evolution of compact gene architectures within sequence clusters relative to single-copy genes. We show that RR-2 proteins from sequence-cluster genes have complex repeats and extreme amino-acid compositions relative to single-copy CPR proteins in An. gambiae, and that the amino-acid composition of the N-terminal and C-terminal sequence flanking the chitin-binding consensus region evolves in a correlated fashion.",2008,"R Scott Cornman, Judith H Willis, R Scott Cornman, Judith H Willis"
Robustness and state-space structure of Boolean gene regulatory models,17936309,10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.09.004,"Robustness to perturbation is an important characteristic of genetic regulatory systems, but the relationship between robustness and model dynamics has not been clearly quantified. We propose a method for quantifying both robustness and dynamics in terms of state-space structures, for Boolean models of genetic regulatory systems. By investigating existing models of the Drosophila melanogaster segment polarity network and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell-cycle network, we show that the structure of attractor basins can yield insight into the underlying decision making required of the system, and also the way in which the system maximises its robustness. In particular, gene networks implementing decisions based on a few genes have simple state-space structures, and their attractors are robust by virtue of their simplicity. Gene networks with decisions that involve many interacting genes have correspondingly more complicated state-space structures, and robustness cannot be achieved through the structure of the attractor basins, but is achieved by larger attractor basins that dominate the state space. These different types of robustness are demonstrated by the two models: the D. melanogaster segment polarity network is robust due to simple attractor basins that implement decisions based on spatial signals; the S. cerevisiae cell-cycle network has a complicated state-space structure, and is robust only due to a giant attractor basin that dominates the state space.",2007,"Kai Willadsen, Janet Wiles, Kai Willadsen, Janet Wiles"
A mosquito 2-Cys peroxiredoxin protects against nitrosative and oxidative stresses associated with malaria parasite infection,16540402,10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2005.10.059,"Malaria parasite infection in anopheline mosquitoes induces nitrosative and oxidative stresses that limit parasite development, but also damage mosquito tissues in proximity to the response. Based on these observations, we proposed that cellular defenses in the mosquito may be induced to minimize self-damage. Specifically, we hypothesized that peroxiredoxins (Prxs), enzymes known to detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen oxide species (RNOS), protect mosquito cells. We identified an Anopheles stephensi 2-Cys Prx ortholog of Drosophila melanogaster Prx-4783, which protects fly cells against oxidative stresses. To assess function, AsPrx-4783 was overexpressed in D. melanogaster S2 and in A. stephensi (MSQ43) cells and silenced in MSQ43 cells with RNA interference before treatment with various ROS and RNOS. Our data revealed that AsPrx-4783 and DmPrx-4783 differ in host cell protection and that AsPrx-4783 protects A. stephensi cells against stresses that are relevant to malaria parasite infection in vivo, namely nitric oxide (NO), hydrogen peroxide, nitroxyl, and peroxynitrite. Further, AsPrx-4783 expression is induced in the mosquito midgut by parasite infection at times associated with peak nitrosative and oxidative stresses. Hence, whereas the NO-mediated defense response is toxic to both host and parasite, AsPrx-4783 may shift the balance in favor of the mosquito.",2006,"Tina M L Peterson, Shirley Luckhart, Tina M L Peterson, Shirley Luckhart"
Molecular and bioinformatic analysis of the FB-NOF transposable element,16478650,10.1016/j.gene.2005.11.020,"The Drosophila melanogaster transposable element FB-NOF is known to play a role in genome plasticity through the generation of all sort of genomic rearrangements. Moreover, several insertional mutants due to FB mobilizations have been reported. Its structure and sequence, however, have been poorly studied mainly as a consequence of the long, complex and repetitive sequence of FB inverted repeats. This repetitive region is composed of several 154 bp blocks, each with five almost identical repeats. In this paper, we report the sequencing process of 2 kb long FB inverted repeats of a complete FB-NOF element, with high precision and reliability. This achievement has been possible using a new map of the FB repetitive region, which identifies unambiguously each repeat with new features that can be used as landmarks. With this new vision of the element, a list of FB-NOF in the D. melanogaster genomic clones has been done, improving previous works that used only bioinformatic algorithms. The availability of many FB and FB-NOF sequences allowed an analysis of the FB insertion sequences that showed no sequence specificity, but a preference for A/T rich sequences. The position of NOF into FB is also studied, revealing that it is always located after a second repeat in a random block. With the results of this analysis, we propose a model of transposition in which NOF jumps from FB to FB, using an unidentified transposase enzyme that should specifically recognize the second repeat end of the FB blocks.",2006,"Martí Badal, Anna Portela, Noel Xamena, Oriol Cabré, Martí Badal, Anna Portela, Noel Xamena, Oriol Cabré"

In this study, a temperature-sensitive HSF mutant line was used to investigate the role of HSF activation following heat hardening, rapid cold hardening (RCH) and long-term cold acclimation (LTCA) on heat and cold resistance, and this was correlated with Hsp70 expression. In addition, the effect of HSF activation on high-temperature knock-down resistance was evaluated. We found a significantly decreased HSF activation in the mutant line as compared to a corresponding control line following heat hardening, and this was correlated with decreased heat resistance of the mutant line. However, we did not find this difference in HSF activity to be important for resistance to cold stress or high-temperature knock-down.

Immediately after shedding the old cuticle, the neurohormone bursicon causes the hardening and darkening of the new cuticle. Here we show that bursicon, to our knowledge the first heterodimeric cystine knot hormone found in insects, consists of two proteins encoded by the genes burs and pburs (partner of burs). The pburs/burs heterodimer from Drosophila melanogaster binds with high affinity and specificity to activate the G protein-coupled receptor DLGR2, leading to the stimulation of cAMP signaling in vitro and tanning in neck-ligated blowflies. Native bursicon from Periplaneta americana is also a heterodimer. In D. melanogaster the levels of pburs, burs, and DLGR2 transcripts are increased before ecdysis, consistent with their role in postecdysial cuticle changes. Immunohistochemical analyses in diverse insect species revealed the colocalization of pburs- and burs-immunoreactivity in some of the neurosecretory neurons that also express crustacean cardioactive peptide. Forty-three years after its initial description, the elucidation of the molecular identity of bursicon and the verification of its receptor allow for studies of bursicon actions in regulating cuticle tanning, wing expansion, and as yet unknown functions.

The mus308 locus of Drosophila melanogaster is implicated in the bypass of ENU-induced O-alkylpyrimidine adducts,10732683,10.1007/s004380050041,"The mus308 locus of D. melanogaster was originally characterized by virtue of a mutant phenotype that resulted in specific hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents. However, the gene product has also been implicated in the repair of lesions other than cross-links. The gene was recently sequenced, and it encodes a protein with motifs characteristic of both DNA polymerases and helicases. We present mutability studies, using the recessive lethal (RL) test, which show that N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) induces hypermutability in mus308-deficient conditions, although only in early broods. Further studies elucidated the role of MUS308 in repair processes by characterizing the spectrum of molecular mutations induced by in vivo ENU in postmeiotic germ cells, in mus308 conditions. These revealed that, in comparison to repair-proficient conditions, there is an increase in the frequency of GC --> AT and AT --> GC transitions, and AT --> TA transversions. Moreover, frameshift mutations, which have not previously been reported to form part of the ENU spectrum, were also found. These results indicate that MUS308 is needed to process ENU-induced lesions, and support the hypothesis that the mus308 gene plays a role in post-replication bypass of O-alkylpyrimidines, probably mediated by recombination, which serves to increase the time available for error-free repair of these persistent and highly mutagenic lesions.",2000,"L Tosal, M A Comendador, L M Sierra, L Tosal, M A Comendador, L M Sierra"
QTL mapping of genotype-environment interaction for fitness in Drosophila melanogaster,9717436,10.1017/s0016672398003176,"A fundamental assumption of models for the maintenance of genetic variation by environmental heterogeneity is that selection favours alternative alleles in different environments. It is not clear, however, whether such antagonistic pleiotropy is common. We mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) causing variation for reproductive performance in each of three environmental treatments among a set of 98 recombinant inbred (RI) lines derived from a cross between two D. melanogaster laboratory strains. The three treatments were standard medium at 25 degrees C, ethanol-supplemented medium at 25 degrees C, and standard medium at 18 degrees C. The RI lines showed highly significant genotype-environment interaction for the fitness measure. Of six QTLs with significant effects on fitness in at least one of the environments, five had significantly different effects at the different temperatures. In each case, the QTL by temperature interaction arose because the QTL had stronger effects at one temperature than at the other. No evidence for QTLs with opposite fitness effects in different environments was found. These results, together with those of recent studies of crop plants, suggest that antagonistic pleiotropy is a relatively uncommon form of genotype-environment interaction for fitness, but additional studies of natural populations are needed to confirm this conclusion.",1998,"J D Fry, S V Nuzhdin, E G Pasyukova, T F Mackay, J D Fry, S V Nuzhdin, E G Pasyukova, T F Mackay"
Two dominant mutations in the mouse fused gene are the result of transposon insertions,9335612,,"The mouse Fused locus encodes a protein that has been implicated in the regulation of embryonic axis formation. The protein, which has been named Axin to distinguish it from the product of the unrelated Drosophila melanogaster gene fused, contains regions of similarity to the RGS (regulators of G-protein signaling) family of proteins as well as to dishevelled, a protein that acts downstream of Wingless in D. melanogaster. Loss-of-function mutations at Fused lead to lethality between days 8 and 10 of gestation. Three dominant mutations result in a kinked tail in heterozygotes. Two of the dominant mutations, Fused and Knobbly, result from insertion of intracisternal A particle retrotransposons into the gene. The insertion in Fused, within the sixth intron, creates a gene that produces wild-type transcripts as well as mutant transcripts that initiate at both the authentic promoter and the 3'-most long terminal repeat of the insertion. Knobbly, an insertion of the retrotransposon into exon 7, precludes the production of wild-type protein. Thus the Fused homozygote is viable whereas Knobbly is a recessive embryonic lethal. In both mutants the dominant kink-tailed phenotype is likely to result from the synthesis of similar amino-terminal fragments of Axin protein that would contain the RGS domain, but lack the dishevelled domain.",1997,"T J Vasicek, L Zeng, X J Guan, T Zhang, F Costantini, S M Tilghman, T J Vasicek, L Zeng, X J Guan, T Zhang, F Costantini, S M Tilghman"
X chromosome nucleolus organizer mutants which alter major type I repeat multiplicity in Drosophila melanogaster,6308398,10.1007/BF00331074,"The nucleolus organizer (NO) of the D. melanogaster X chromosome is composed of ribosomal repeat units which contain two types (I and II) of non-rDNA insertions (In+) and repeats with no insertions (In-). Evidence from other laboratories indicate random interspersion of all types of repeat units within the X NO. An EcoRI and BamHI examination of rDNA from two bobbed mutants, bb2rI and mal12 demonstrates segregation of the major type I repeat units. The 46 rDNA repeats of the bb2rI NO contain no detectable major type I repeats whereas the majority of the 68 rDNA mal12 repeats are major type I and tandemly linked. This observation suggests that gross deletions of rDNA can result in nucleolus organizer regions with predominantly one type of repeat unit. Additivity tests demonstrate that the 46 ribosomal repeats of the bb2rI chromosome revert the phenotype of other bobbed NOs, but the 68 mal12 ribosomal repeats show no or slight additivity. This is in agreement with the observation that In+ repeats do not significantly contribute to functional rRNA. A Southern blot analysis using BamHI which cuts only in type I insertions demonstrates that the majority of major type I In+ repeating units exist in tandem linkage group(s) within the X NO.",1983,"Z D Sharp, V V Gandhi, J D Procunier, Z D Sharp, V V Gandhi, J D Procunier"

Speed dependent descending control of freezing behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,30209268,10.1038/s41467-018-05875-1,"The most fundamental choice an animal has to make when it detects a threat is whether to freeze, reducing its chances of being noticed, or to flee to safety. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster exposed to looming stimuli in a confined arena either freeze or flee. The probability of freezing versus fleeing is modulated by the fly's walking speed at the time of threat, demonstrating that freeze/flee decisions depend on behavioral state. We describe a pair of descending neurons crucially implicated in freezing. Genetic silencing of DNp09 descending neurons disrupts freezing yet does not prevent fleeing. Optogenetic activation of both DNp09 neurons induces running and freezing in a state-dependent manner. Our findings establish walking speed as a key factor in defensive response choices and reveal a pair of descending neurons as a critical component in the circuitry mediating selection and execution of freezing or fleeing behaviors.",2018,"Ricardo Zacarias, Shigehiro Namiki, Gwyneth M Card, Maria Luisa Vasconcelos, Marta A Moita, Ricardo Zacarias, Shigehiro Namiki, Gwyneth M Card, Maria Luisa Vasconcelos, Marta A Moita"

Recent studies of thermal physiology have been influenced by verbal models that fail to consider the selective advantage of acclimation and thus make no predictions about variation in acclimation capacity. We used a quantitative model of optimal plasticity to generate predictions about the capacity of Drosophila melanogaster to acclimate to developmental temperature. This model predicts that the ability to acclimate thermal sensitivity should evolve when temperature varies greatly among generations. Based on the model, we expected that flies from the highly seasonal environment of New Jersey would acclimate thermal sensitivity more than would flies from the less seasonal environment of Florida. When raised at constant and fluctuating temperatures, flies from these populations failed to adjust their thermal optima in the way predicted by the model, suggesting that current assumptions about functional and genetic constraints should be reconsidered.",2010,"B S Cooper, M Czarnoleski, M J Angilletta Jr, B S Cooper, M Czarnoleski, M J Angilletta Jr"

Pathogenicity of life-shortening Wolbachia in Aedes albopictus after transfer from Drosophila melanogaster,19820149,10.1128/AEM.01331-09,"Maternally inherited Wolbachia bacteria have evolved mechanisms to manipulate the reproduction of their invertebrate hosts, promoting infection spread.

Here, wMelPop Wolbachia is transferred from Drosophila melanogaster into the mosquito Aedes albopictus. Characterization of the resulting strain provides an extreme example of Wolbachia as a pathogen. In addition to reduced longevity and fecundity, abnormally high Wolbachia density is associated with embryonic mortality that masks the typical pattern of cytoplasmic incompatibility. The results are consistent with earlier reports that show unpredictable shifts in the Wolbachia phenotype after interspecific transfer, which can complicate proposed strategies to modify the age structure of medically important vector populations.",2009,"Eunho Suh, David R Mercer, Yuqing Fu, Stephen L Dobson, Eunho Suh, David R Mercer, Yuqing Fu, Stephen L Dobson"

Conversely, down-regulation of Sln suppresses LKB1-dependent apoptosis, implicating Sln as a downstream mediator of LKB1. The kinase activity of LKB1 induces apical trafficking of Sln in polarized cells, and LKB1-dependent Sln trafficking is crucial for triggering apoptosis induced by extracellular butyrate.

Irradiation changed the lifespan depending on the genotype. The lifespan and the functional (neuromuscular) activity, which reflects the ""life quality"", changed in the same direction. A mechanism was suggested for the remote effect of low-dose irradiation on the lifespan. Since cells with a weakened defense system accumulate lesions and age at a higher rate, their elimination in early ontogeny decelerates age-related changes and decreases the aging rate. In subsequent generations, this somatic stress response (hormesis) is replaced by negative genetic effects at the population level and, consequently, the lifespan decreases.",2006,"A A Moskalev, A S Iatskiv, V G Zaĭnullin, A A Moskalev, A S Iatskiv, V G Zaĭnullin"

A further study of interchromosomal epistatic interaction in male mating activity of Drosophila melanogaster,8496067,10.1038/hdy.1993.52,"The interchromosomal epistatic interaction between second and third chromosomes was investigated for male mating activity of Drosophila melanogaster. The observed mating activity of double chromosome homozygotes is 0.526 +/- 0.044, whereas the expected one under the multiplicative model is calculated to be 0.511 +/- 0.038. These two male mating activities are in excellent agreement, indicating no interchromosomal epistasis. The coefficient of interaction, i, is quantified as -0.174 +/- 0.168. The magnitude of the k statistic, another index of epistasis, is 0.0001 +/- 0.0267. Neither index of epistasis differs statistically from zero. The result also shows that there is little or no epistatic interaction between two major chromosomes. However, one interchromosomal synthetic sterility was found in 26 chromosome lines. These results are combined with those of Kosuda (1985) and the generality of epistatic interaction is discussed.",1993,"K Kosuda, K Kosuda"
"Genetic and biochemical characterization of little isoxanthopterin (lix), a gene controlling dihydropterin oxidase activity in Drosophila melanogaster",1745247,10.1007/BF00290656,"Dihydropterin oxidase catalyses the oxidation of 7,8-dihydropteridines into their fully oxidized products, and is involved in the biosynthesis of isoxanthopterin. Fifteen Drosophila melanogaster mutants, selected for their low pterin and isoxanthopterin content, were assayed for dihydropterin oxidase activity. The activity was around 100% in most mutants tested, slightly reduced in red, g and dke, and undetectable in lix. In flies carrying various doses of the lix+ allele, a correlation was found between enzyme activity and the number of lix+ copies in the genome. The results suggest that lix is the structural gene for the dihydropterin oxidase enzyme. Isoxanthopterin was quantitated in strains carrying deficiencies for the region in which lix has been mapped by recombination. This allowed us to assign the lix locus to the 7D10-7F1-2 segment of the X chromosome.",1991,"F J Silva, B Escriche, E Ordoño, J Ferré, F J Silva, B Escriche, E Ordoño, J Ferré"
The molecular structure of TE146 and its derivatives in Drosophila melanogaster,1649070,,"TE146 is a giant transposon of Drosophila melanogaster. It carries two copies of the white and roughest genes, normally found on the X chromosome. The structure of this transposon has been studied at the molecular level. TE146 may transpose to new chromosome positions, excise and be lost from the genome or undergo internal rearrangements. The termini of TE146 are foldback DNA elements (FB); the transposon also carries two internal FB elements. Loss or internal rearrangement of TE146 involves recombination between different FB elements. These events have been mapped molecularly, by taking advantage of the fact that the FB sequences are composed largely of a regular 155-bp repeat sequence that is cut by the restriction enzyme TaqI, and are shown to be nonrandom. We suggest that these FB-FB exchange events occur by mitotic sister-chromatid exchange in the premeiotic germ line.",1991,"R Lovering, N Harden, M Ashburner, R Lovering, N Harden, M Ashburner"
High levels of recombination induced by homologous P elements in Drosophila melanogaster,1850087,10.1007/BF00261685,"P element transposons in Drosophila melanogaster are capable of mobilizing incomplete P elements elsewhere in the genome, and of inducing recombination. This recombination is usually only of the order of 1% or less. We show that two P elements, located at exactly homologous sites, induce levels of recombination of 20% or higher. The recombination appears to be exact, as determined by the lack of phenotypic effects in recombinant products and the lack of size changes detectable by Southern hybridization. Female recombination is increased, but to a lesser extent than male recombination. Somatic recombination levels are also elevated. Alternative explanations for the high recombination levels are given in terms of the consequences of repair of an excision site and in terms of recombination as part of the replicative transposition process.",1991,"J A Sved, L M Blackman, A S Gilchrist, W R Engels, J A Sved, L M Blackman, A S Gilchrist, W R Engels"

The cross-resistance spectrum of a backcrossed strain lacking elevated mixed function oxidase activity, a common resistance mechanism, was examined. Levels of resistance similar to those found in other insects were found to dieldrin, aldrin, endrin, lindane, and picrotoxinin. Strong similarity of this single major gene with that found in other cyclodiene resistant insects is suggested by its cross-resistance spectrum and chromosomal location, via homology with other Diptera.

Fourteen sets of 5X5 partial diallel cross experiments were made to examine the emigration activity of F1 progeny. Emigration activity was scored using the method of Sakai et al. (1958). Additive genetic variance was 0.0377 +/- 0.0069 and dominance variance 0.0076 +/- 0.0032. The average degree of dominance of mildly deleterious genes for emigration activity in an equilibrium population was 0.069 +/- 0.042.

The disconnected visual system mutations in Drosophila melanogaster drastically disrupt circadian rhythms,2519577,10.1177/074873048900400101,"Mutations at the disconnected (disco) locus in Drosophila melanogaster cause cultures of this insect to eclose in an essentially arrhythmic manner and also nearly eliminate free-running circadian rhythms of locomotor activity. Yet disco mutants are not totally light-insensitive: Whereas they performed very poorly in tests of certain behavioral responses to visual stimuli, they were able to exhibit ""forced"" periodic locomotor activity under conditions of light-dark cycling. We discuss these results in the context of (1) the dispensability of this insect's external photoreceptors for entrainment of its circadian pacemaker, and (2) possible disco-induced abnormalities in the connections of extraocular photoreceptors to their targets in the central nervous system and/or abnormalities in the targets themselves--which presumably include elements of the fly's circadian clock.",1989,"M S Dushay, M Rosbash, J C Hall, M S Dushay, M Rosbash, J C Hall"

The most striking exception from this are high additive genetic variances for preadult developmental duration in both sexes. Females exhibit significant negative genetic correlations between early and late components of fitness. In contrast to females, we did not observe any measurable correlations between components of fitness in males. Our data suggest that genetic covariance structure between fitness components differs by sex. We also observed significant negative correlations between virility of males and late components of female life history.",1988,"N Tucić, D Cvetković, D Milanović, N Tucić, D Cvetković, D Milanović"
Variation in Y chromosome segregation in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster,3104134,,"Functional variation among Y chromosomes in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster was assayed by a segregation study.

Eleven of the Y chromosomes were from diverse geographic origins, and the remaining 25 were from locally captured flies. Segregation of sexes in adult offspring was scored for the four possible crosses among the two backgrounds with each Y chromosome. Although the design confounds meiotic drive and effects on viability, statistical partitioning of these effects reveals significant variation among lines in Y chromosome segregation. Results are discussed in regards to models of Y-linked segregation and viability effects, which suggest that Y-linked adaptive polymorphism is unlikely.",1987,"A G Clark, A G Clark"

This result was observed both in flies heterozygous for the hsp40 gene and in tissue culture cells transfected with the truncated gene. Analysis of the transcription of the hsp40 gene indicated that its mRNA, unlike hsp70 mRNA, was not actively destabilized after a return to control temperatures, permitting prolonged production of the mutant protein.",1985,"A A Simcox, C M Cheney, E P Hoffman, A Shearn, A A Simcox, C M Cheney, E P Hoffman, A Shearn"
Comparative properties of three forms of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in Drosophila melanogaster,6422927,10.1007/BF00488467,"Three alleles of the Zw locus of Drosophila melanogaster--ZwA, ZwB, and Zwlol--apparently code for dimeric, tetrameric, and monomeric forms of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), respectively. The three forms of G6PD are characterized by different apparent Km values for glucose-6-phosphate but similar apparent Km values for NAPD+. When high concentrations of NAPD+ were added to enzyme preparations, the ZwA and Zwlol forms of G6PD assumed tetrameric and dimeric properties, respectively. Although Zwlol adults exhibit little G6PD activity, they maintain levels of G6PD-antigen comparable to those in ZwA and ZwB adults. Thus the low level of G6PD activity in Zwlol individuals cannot be explained as the consequence of lack of synthesis of the G6PD subunit.",1983,"J H Williamson, M M Bentley, J H Williamson, M M Bentley"

Compared with 1-day-old adults, 48-day-old adults exhibited no more than a 12% decrease in methionyl-tRNA binding to 40 S subunits and a 20% decrease in binding to 80 S particles. Increased age, therefore, had relatively little effect on initiation, and the decreased polyribosomal content was probably due to the deterioration of some other component of the translation system.",1981,"G C Webster, S L Webster, W A Landis, G C Webster, S L Webster, W A Landis"
Localization of ecdysterone on polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster,6769118,10.1073/pnas.77.4.2108,"Ecdysterone has been crosslinked in situ to polytene chromosomes of salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster by photoactivation. The crosslinked hormone has been localized on the chromosomes by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. At different developmental stages the hormone was detected at different chromosomal loci. These chromosomal sites correspond to ecdysterone-inducible puff sites. Thus, the hormone binds directly to chromosomal loci, whose transcription depends on the presence of the hormone. Ecdysterone was also crosslinked to one puff site that regresses during larval development. This indicates that (i) hormone binding to polytene chromosomes activates transcription at specific loci, and (ii) hormone-dependent regression of intermolt puff 68C is mediated by direct binding of ecdysterone. Ecdysterone was not detected on puff sites that are independent of hormone action or in chromosomal interbands. After heat shock, no ecdysterone became crosslinked to polytene chromosomes.",1980,"H Gronemeyer, O Pongs, H Gronemeyer, O Pongs"
Structural and functional analysis of the scute locus in Drosophila melanogaster,24306719,10.1007/BF00268117,"The functional expression of 12 scute alleles in homozygotes and compounds of Drosophila melanogaster at 14°, 22°, 30°C is analysed.

The basic features of the maps, clustering and polarity, are invariable with respect to temperature, scute gene dosage and cross direction. In addition local dominance of the norm over bristle reduction was produced by the scute mutation; different types of complementation reactions were established for each bristle. The gene scute is treated as an operon-like system, composed of 3-4 cistrons with each controlling the formation of bristles on a particular region of the fly's body. This model argues well with the structure of maps constructed and implies a post-translational level of initial events of bristle-formation process.",1979,"D P Furman, S N Rodin, V A Ratner, D P Furman, S N Rodin, V A Ratner"
Extrachromosomal control of mutability in Drosophila melanogaster,115009,10.1073/pnas.76.8.4011,"Hybrid dysgenesis is a syndrome of germ-line aberrations including, e.g., sterility and mutation, found in certain interstrain hybrids of Drosophila melanogaster. Previous studies of sterility have shown that elements responsible for dysgenesis may reside on all major chromosomes, but that their dysgenesis-causing ability is controlled by an unknown extrachromosomal factor. Dysgenic hybrids also give rise to unstable visible mutations thought to be DNA insertions at certain sensitive loci. One such unstable allele at the singed bristle locus, designated snw, was found to mutate at extraordinary rates exceeding 50%. This instability was shown to be under the same extrachromosomal control as hybrid dysgenesis itself. That is, the mutability of snw was reversibly suppressed when placed in the background cytotype known to prevent sterility and other characteristics of hybrid dysgenesis. These results suggest that snw may represent an insertion at the singed locus of a hypothetical gene responsible for hybrid dysgenesis.",1979,"W R Engels, W R Engels"

Interactions between ageing and inbreeding effects on development of Drosophila melanogaster embryos,823383,10.1016/0047-6374(76)90031-2,"Ageing and brother-sister inbreeding effects were studied simultaneously during the development of Drosophila melanogaster. Egg hatchability and adult emergence were investigated in relation to age of females laying the eggs and the age of the parents of these females. Each couple was followed individually. The effects of parental age varied according to the mating system used. Both hatchability and emergency of inbred eggs were affected by ageing. This indicates that parental constitution can influence early and later stages of development. Control of embryonic and larvo-pupal developments may involve processes perturbed by both ageing and inbreeding. Thus, information related to the genetic control system of development varies with the age of the flies and of their parents and consequently modulates the inbreeding effects. It is postulated that inbreeding and ageing may both involve cytoplasmic-genome interactions implicated in the control of embryogenesis.",1976,"C Biemont, C Biemont"
Evidence for coadaptation: negative correlation between lethal genes and polymorphic inversions in Drosophila melanogaster,817963,,"Through examination of all available data on lethal and inversion frequencies on the second chromosome in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster, we have discovered that there is a clear negative correlation between the two quantities. Lethal genes are located more densely on the regions of standard gene arrangement than the inverted regions, and this accounts for the negative correlation. To reveal the underlying mechanism of the phenomena, we have carried out an experiment and found that effect of EMS-induced mutations on the inversion-carrying chromosome is more severe than that on the standard chromosome. We interpret these results as evidence for coadaptation or position-effect within the inversion chromosomes. New mutations within the coadapted gene complex are quickly eliminated from the population and polymorphic inversions are kept free of mutants through selective elimination.",1976,"T K Watanabe, T Yamazaki, T K Watanabe, T Yamazaki"

The mutation h (hairy) causes the appearance on the scutellum of extra microchaetae with a definite distribution pattern. The mutation al (aristaless) changes the size and the shape of scutellum and causes the shift of the posterior scutellar bristles. It is shown by the study of double homozygotes al; h/al; h, that this bristle can be shifted into the region occupied by one of microchaetae. The results obtained are considered in the light of the prepattern hypothesis.

Our observations lead us to conclude that each dose of the X-linked gene is more active in the cells of these intersexes than it is in normal triploid or diploid female cells.

"The role of G protein-coupled receptor-related genes in cytochrome P450-mediated resistance of the house fly, Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae), to imidacloprid",31456272,10.1111/imb.12615,"Ninety-four putative G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) were identified in the Musca domestica genome. They were annotated and compared with their homologues in Drosophila melanogaster. Phylogenetic analyses of the GPCRs from both species revealed that several family members shared a closer relationship based on the domain architecture. The expression profiles of these genes were examined by quantitative real-time PCR amongst three strains of the house fly, a near-isogenic line strain with imidacloprid resistance (N-IRS), the corresponding susceptible strain (CSS) and another strain derived from field populations with imidacloprid resistance (IRS). We found that five GPCR genes were upregulated in the N-IRS and eight GPCR genes were upregulated in the IRS strains compared to the CSS strain. The transgenic lines of D. melanogaster with the GPCR genes (LOC101899380 in the N-IRS strain and LOC101895664 in the IRS strain) exhibited significantly increased tolerance to imidacloprid, and higher expression of cytochrome P450 genes. Bioinformatic analysis of LOC101899380 was carried out based on its full-length nucleic acid sequence and putative amino acid sequence, and it was named Methuselah-like10 (Mthl10) owing to its homology with D. melanogaster Mthl10. A cell-base cell counting kit-8 toxicity assay demonstrated that the expression of the GPCR gene LOC101899380 in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells using a baculovirus-mediated expression system can elevate the cell tolerance to imidacloprid, indirectly supporting the hypothesis that the GPCR gene LOC101899380 plays some role in imidacloprid resistance.

Transient receptor potential channels (TRPs) are a family of cation channels a number of which, called thermo-TRPs, are known to function as thermosensors. We investigated the potential role of thermo-TPRs that have been previously identified in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, in thermotaxis and thermal acclimation in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. Phylogenetic analysis of the trp genes showed generally one-to-one orthology between those in D. melanogaster and in T. castaneum, although there are putative gene-losses in two TRP subfamilies of D. melanogaster. With RNA interference (RNAi) of T. castaneum thermo-TRP candidates painless, pyrexia and trpA1, we measured thermal avoidance behavior. RNAi of trpA1 resulted in reduced avoidance of high temperatures, 39 and 42 °C. We also measured the effects of RNAi on heat-induced knockout and death under a short exposure to high temperature (1min at 52 °C) either with or without a 10-min acclimation period at 42 °C. Relatively short exposure to high temperature was enough to induce high temperature thermal acclimation. RNAi of trpA1 led to faster knockout at 52 °C. RNAi of painless showed lower recovery rates from heat-induced knockout after thermal acclimation, and RNAi of pyrexia showed lower long-term survivorship without thermal acclimation. Therefore, we concluded that trpA1 is important in high temperature sensing and also in enhanced tolerance to high-temperature induced knockout; painless plays a role in rapid acclimation to high temperature; and pyrexia functions in protecting beetles from acute heat stress without acclimation.",2015,"Hong Geun Kim, David Margolies, Yoonseong Park, Hong Geun Kim, David Margolies, Yoonseong Park"

The conservation of the myofiber between the fly and vertebrates, the availability of advanced genetic tools, and the ability to visualize dynamic processes using fluorescent proteins in vivo makes the fly an excellent system to study myonuclear positioning.

High genetic differentiation between an African and a non-African strain of Drosophila simulans revealed by segregation distortion and reduced crossover frequency,19590966,10.1007/s10709-009-9381-z,"Drosophila simulans strains originating from Madagascar and nearby islands in the Indian Ocean often differ from those elsewhere in the number of sex comb teeth and the degree of morphological anomaly in hybrids with D. melanogaster.

Strong bias against alleles of the Madagascar strain was observed for all ten marker loci distributed over the entire second chromosome in the F1 intercross, but only a few showed a weak distortion in the isogenic backgrounds of either strains. Significant deviations of genotype frequencies from Hardy-Weinberg proportions were consistently observed for the second chromosome. By contrast, the X and third chromosomes did not show any strong segregation distortion. Crossover frequency on the second chromosome was uniformly reduced in isogenic backgrounds whereas the map lengths in the F1 intercross were comparable to or larger than that of the standard D. melanogaster map.

Demasculinization of X chromosomes in the Drosophila genus,17994090,10.1038/nature06330,"X chromosomes evolve differently from autosomes, but general governing principles have not emerged. For example, genes with male-biased expression are under-represented on the X chromosome of D. melanogaster, but are randomly distributed in the genome of Anopheles gambiae. In direct global profiling experiments using species-specific microarrays, we find a nearly identical paucity of genes with male-biased expression on D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. yakuba, D. ananassae, D. virilis and D. mojavensis X chromosomes. We observe the same under-representation on the neo-X of D. pseudoobscura. It has been suggested that precocious meiotic silencing of the X chromosome accounts for reduced X chromosome male-biased expression in nematodes, mammals and Drosophila. We show that X chromosome genes with male-biased expression are under-represented in somatic cells and in mitotic male germ cells. These data are incompatible with simple X chromosome inactivation models. Using expression profiling and comparative sequence analysis, we show that selective gene extinction on the X chromosome, creation of new genes on autosomes and changed genomic location of existing genes contribute to the unusual X chromosome gene content.",2007,"David Sturgill, Yu Zhang, Michael Parisi, Brian Oliver, David Sturgill, Yu Zhang, Michael Parisi, Brian Oliver"
Fluorescent in situ hybridization with transposable element probes to mitotic chromosomal heterochromatin of Drosophila,15020800,10.1385/1-59259-755-6:029,"The technique of in situ hybridization of DNA probes to Drosophila chromosomes has been initially applied to the salivary gland polytene chromosomes and is now routinely used for mapping single-copy and repetitive DNA sequences, such as transposable elements, to the euchromatic regions of these chromosomes. However, most of the heterochromatin normally escapes cytogenetic analyses on polytene chromosomes because it is organized in a poorly differentiated cytological structure called the chromocenter. This peculiar organization does not allow a detailed mapping of DNA clones to heterochromatin. Such a limitation can be overcome by the fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) technique on mitotic chromosomes of D. melanogaster, where heterochromatin has been extensively characterized by banding techniques and subdivided into several cytologically diverse regions. Digital images of FISH signals and DAPI staining can be separately recorded by CCD camera, pseudocolored, and merged using specific software for image analysis. The visualization of the signals and DAPI banding pattern on a single chromosome enables the mapping of a given sequence to specific cytological regions of mitotic heterochromatin. This method has initially proven successful in the detection and mapping of transposable element clusters in the heterochromatin of D. melanogaster and has been used to study the distribution of repeated and even single-copy sequences.",2004,"Patrizio Dimitri, Patrizio Dimitri"
Genetic variation and differentiation at microsatellite loci in Drosophila simulans. Evidence for founder effects in new world populations,9755208,,"Drosophila simulans isofemale lines from Africa, South America, and two locations in North America were surveyed for variation at 16 microsatellite loci on the X, second, and third chromosomes, and 18 microsatellites, which are unmapped. D. simulans is thought to have colonized New World habitats only relatively recently (within the last few hundred years). Consistent with a founder effect occurring as colonizers moved into these New World habitats, we find less microsatellite variability in North and South American D. simulans populations than for an African population. Population subdivision as measured at microsatellites is moderate when averaged across all loci (FST = 0.136), but contrasts sharply with previous studies of allozyme variation, which have showed significantly less differentiation in D. simulans than in D. melanogaster. There are substantially fewer private alleles observed in New World populations of D. simulans than seen in a similar survey of D. melanogaster. In addition to possible differences in population size during their evolutionary histories, varying colonization histories or other demographic events may be necessary to explain discrepancies in the patterns of variation observed at various genetic markers between these closely related species.",1998,"S D Irvin, K A Wetterstrand, C M Hutter, C F Aquadro, S D Irvin, K A Wetterstrand, C M Hutter, C F Aquadro"
A courtship behavior that makes monandrous females polyandrous,32944943,10.1111/evo.14098,"Females of many animal species mate several times with different males (polyandry), whereas females of some species mate with a single male (monandry) only once. Little is known about the mechanisms by which these different mating systems evolve. Females of Drosophila prolongata mate serially, unlike D. melanogaster females that refuse to remate for several days after their first mating (remating suppression, RS). Nevertheless, interestingly, non-virgin D. prolongata females refuse to remate with males that are prohibited from performing their species-specific courtship behavior, leg vibration (LV), suggesting that LV overrides RS making it cryptic in D. prolongata. In this study, we examined how long this cryptic RS persists. Surprisingly, it was sustained for at least two weeks, showing that RS is substantially augmented in D. prolongata compared to that of D. melanogaster. The two most closely related species to D. prolongata, D. rhopaloa and D. carrolli, do not perform LV and showed augmented RS, supporting the idea that augmented RS could have evolved before LV was acquired. These results suggested that D. prolongata females are intrinsically monandrous, whereas the newly evolved courtship behavior makes them polyandrous. This is a rare case in which a proximate mechanism of polyandry evolution from monandry is demonstrated. This article is protected by copyright.

Impacts of Recurrent Hitchhiking on Divergence and Demographic Inference in Drosophila,30010915,10.1093/gbe/evy142,"In species with large population sizes such as Drosophila, natural selection may have substantial effects on genetic diversity and divergence. However, the implications of this widespread nonneutrality for standard population genetic assumptions and practices remain poorly resolved. Here, we assess the consequences of recurrent hitchhiking (RHH), in which selective sweeps occur at a given rate randomly across the genome. We use forward simulations to examine two published RHH models for D. melanogaster, reflecting relatively common/weak and rare/strong selection. We find that unlike the rare/strong RHH model, the common/weak model entails a slight degree of Hill-Robertson interference in high recombination regions. We also find that the common/weak RHH model is more consistent with our genome-wide estimate of the proportion of substitutions fixed by natural selection between D. melanogaster and D. simulans (19%). Finally, we examine how these models of RHH might bias demographic inference. We find that these RHH scenarios can bias demographic parameter estimation, but such biases are weaker for parameters relating recently diverged populations, and for the common/weak RHH model in general. Thus, even for species with important genome-wide impacts of selective sweeps, neutralist demographic inference can have some utility in understanding the histories of recently diverged populations.",2018,"Jeremy D Lange, John E Pool, Jeremy D Lange, John E Pool"
Genetic complexity underlying hybrid male sterility in Drosophila,15020468,10.1534/genetics.166.2.789,"Recent genetic analyses of closely related species of Drosophila have indicated that hybrid male sterility is the consequence of highly complex synergistic effects among multiple genes, both conspecific and heterospecific. On the contrary, much evidence suggests the presence of major genes causing hybrid female sterility and inviability in the less-related species, D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Does this contrast reflect the genetic distance between species? Or, generally, is the genetic basis of hybrid male sterility more complex than that of hybrid female sterility and inviability? To clarify this point, the D. simulans introgression of the cytological region 34D-36A to the D. melanogaster genome, which causes recessive male sterility, was dissected by recombination, deficiency, and complementation mapping. The 450-kb region between two genes, Suppressor of Hairless and snail, exhibited a strong effect on the sterility. Males are (semi-)sterile if this region of the introgression is made homozygous or hemizygous. But no genes in the region singly cause the sterility; this region has at least two genes, which in combination result in male sterility. Further, the males are less fertile when heterozygous with a larger introgression, which suggests that dominant modifiers enhance the effects of recessive genes of male sterility. Such an epistatic view, even in the less-related species, suggests that the genetic complexity is special to hybrid male sterility.",2004,"Kyoichi Sawamura, John Roote, Chung-I Wu, Masa-Toshi Yamamoto, Kyoichi Sawamura, John Roote, Chung-I Wu, Masa-Toshi Yamamoto"
Characterization of a male-predominant antisense transcript underexpressed in hybrids of Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis,14704168,,"Characterizing genes that are misregulated in hybrids may elucidate the genetic basis of hybrid sterility or other hybrid dysfunctions that contribute to speciation. Previously, a small segment of a male-predominant transcript that is underexpressed in adult male hybrids of Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis relative to pure species was identified in a differential display screen. Here, we obtained the full sequence of this 1330-bp transcript and determined that it is an antisense message with high sequence similarity to the D. melanogaster TRAP100 gene, part of the Mediator protein complex that regulates transcriptional initiation during development. Both the sense and the antisense messages are transcribed in D. pseudoobscura, but only the sense message (TRAP100) is transcribed in D. melanogaster complex species. Unlike the antisense message, the sense message is transcribed similarly in D. pseudoobscura males and females and in hybrids of D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. The high sequence similarity between distantly related species suggests that the sense message is functionally constrained within the genus. We speculate that the antisense transcript may have evolved a role in male-specific post-transcriptional regulation of TRAP100 in the D. pseudoobscura lineage and that its underexpression in sterile hybrid males may cause an overproduction of TRAP100 protein, possibly yielding deleterious effects.",2003,"Mohamed A F Noor, Pawel Michalak, David Donze, Mohamed A F Noor, Pawel Michalak, David Donze"

Comparisons of the promoter sequence and pattern of expression of the gene during development suggest that the regulation of zen has been conserved during evolution. The conservation of zen expression in a subpopulation of the polar cells indicates the existence of an important role in such cells.

The effects of sublethal doses of azadirachtin on life-table traits and oviposition behaviour of a model organism in toxicological studies, D. melanogaster, were evaluated. The fecundity and oviposition preference of flies surviving to single azadirachtin-treated larvae of parental generation was adversely affected and resulted in the reduction of the number of eggs laid and increased aversion to this compound over two successive generations. In parental generation, early exposure to azadirachtin affects adult's development by reducing the number of organisms, delay larval and pupal development; male biased sex ratio and induced morphological alterations. Moreover, adult's survival of the two generations was significantly decreased as compared to the control. Therefore, Single preimaginal azadirachtin treatment can affect flies population dynamics via transgenerational reductions in survival and reproduction capacity as well as reinforcement of oviposition avoidance which can contribute as repellent strategies in integrated pest management programs.

As a counterpoint to the intensively investigated and highly derived cyclorrhaphan flies that include the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, we are studying the basal Diptera Bradysia hygida, a member of the Sciaridae family that is amenable to laboratory cultivation. Here we describe the B. hygida embryogenesis, which lasts 9 days at 22 °C. The use of standard fixation D. melanogaster protocols resulted in embryos refractory to DAPI staining and to overcome this, a new enzyme-based method was developed. Calcofluor-White staining of enzimatically-treated embryos revealed that this method removes chitin from the serosal cuticle surrounding the B. hygida embryo. Chitin is one of the main components of serosal cuticles and searches in a B. hygida embryonic transcriptome database revealed conservation of the chitin synthesis pathway, further supporting the occurrence of chitin biosynthesis in B. hygida embryos. Combining the enzymatic treatment protocol with the use of both DIC and fluorescence microscopy allowed the first complete description of the B. hygida embryogenesis.

Dscam1 in Pancrustacean Immunity: Current Status and a Look to the Future,28649249,10.3389/fimmu.2017.00662,"The Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule 1 (Dscam1) gene is an extraordinary example of diversity: by combining alternatively spliced exons, thousands of isoforms can be produced from just one gene. So far, such diversity in this gene has only been found in insects and crustaceans, and its essential part in neural wiring has been well-characterized for Drosophila melanogaster. Ten years ago evidence from D. melanogaster showed that the Dscam1 gene is involved in insect immune defense and work on Anopheles gambiae indicated that it is a hypervariable immune receptor. These exciting findings showed that via processes of somatic diversification insects have the possibility to produce unexpected immune molecule diversity, and it was hypothesized that Dscam1 could provide the mechanistic underpinnings of specific immune responses. Since these first publications the quest to understand the function of this gene has uncovered fascinating insights from insects and crustaceans. However, we are still far from a complete understanding of how Dscam1 functions in relation to parasites and pathogens and its full relevance for the immune system. In this Hypothesis and Theory article, we first briefly introduce Dscam1 and what we know so far about how it might function in immunity. By focusing on seven questions, we then share our sometimes contrasting thoughts on what the evidence tells us so far, what essential experiments remain to be done, and the future prospects, with the aim to provide a multiangled view on what this fascinating gene has to do with immune defense.",2017,"Sophie A O Armitage, Joachim Kurtz, Daniela Brites, Yuemei Dong, Louis Du Pasquier, Han-Ching Wang, Sophie A O Armitage, Joachim Kurtz, Daniela Brites, Yuemei Dong, Louis Du Pasquier, Han-Ching Wang"
Smads and insect hemimetabolan metamorphosis,27452629,10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.07.006,"In contrast with Drosophila melanogaster, practically nothing is known about the involvement of the TGF-β signaling pathway in the metamorphosis of hemimetabolan insects. To partially fill this gap, we have studied the role of Smad factors in the metamorphosis of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica. In D. melanogaster, Mad is the canonical R-Smad of the BMP branch of the TGF-β signaling pathway, Smox is the canonical R-Smad of the TGF-β/Activin branch and Medea participates in both branches. In insects, metamorphosis is regulated by the MEKRE93 pathway, which starts with juvenile hormone (JH), whose signal is transduced by Methoprene-tolerant (Met), which stimulates the expression of Krüppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1) that acts to repress E93, the metamorphosis trigger. In B. germanica, metamorphosis is determined at the beginning of the sixth (final) nymphal instar (N6), when JH production ceases, the expression of Kr-h1 declines, and the transcription of E93 begins to increase. The RNAi of Mad, Smox and Medea in N6 of B. germanica reveals that the BMP branch of the TGF-β signaling pathway regulates adult ecdysis and wing extension, mainly through regulating the expression of bursicon, whereas the TGF-β/Activin branch contributes to increasing E93 and decreasing Kr-h1 at the beginning of N6, crucial for triggering adult morphogenesis, as well as to regulating the imaginal molt timing.",2016,"Carolina G Santos, Ana Fernandez-Nicolas, Xavier Belles, Carolina G Santos, Ana Fernandez-Nicolas, Xavier Belles"
Co-expression of Dorsal and Rel2 Negatively Regulates Antimicrobial Peptide Expression in the Tobacco Hornworm Manduca sexta,26847920,10.1038/srep20654,"Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) plays an essential role in regulation of innate immunity. In mammals, NF-κB factors can form homodimers and heterodimers to activate gene expression. In insects, three NF-κB factors, Dorsal, Dif and Relish, have been identified to activate antimicrobial peptide (AMP) gene expression. However, it is not clear whether Dorsal (or Dif) and Relish can form heterodimers. Here we report the identification and functional analysis of a Dorsal homologue (MsDorsal) and two Relish short isoforms (MsRel2A and MsRel2B) from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. Both MsRel2A and MsRel2B contain only a Rel homology domain (RHD) and lack the ankyrin-repeat inhibitory domain. Overexpression of the RHD domains of MsDorsal and MsRel2 in Drosophila melanogaster S2 and Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells can activate AMP gene promoters from M. sexta and D. melanogaster. We for the first time confirmed the interaction between MsDorsal-RHD and MsRel2-RHD, and suggesting that Dorsal and Rel2 may form heterodimers. More importantly, co-expression of MsDorsal-RHD with MsRel2-RHD suppressed activation of several M. sexta AMP gene promoters. Our results suggest that the short MsRel2 isoforms may form heterodimers with MsDorsal as a novel mechanism to prevent over-activation of antimicrobial peptides.",2016,"Xue Zhong, Xiang-Jun Rao, Hui-Yu Yi, Xin-Yu Lin, Xiao-Hong Huang, Xiao-Qiang Yu, Xue Zhong, Xiang-Jun Rao, Hui-Yu Yi, Xin-Yu Lin, Xiao-Hong Huang, Xiao-Qiang Yu"
Cell signalling mechanisms for insect stress tolerance,24353211,10.1242/jeb.090571,"Insects successfully occupy most environmental niches and this success depends on surviving a broad range of environmental stressors including temperature, desiccation, xenobiotic, osmotic and infection stress. Epithelial tissues play key roles as barriers between the external and internal environments and therefore maintain homeostasis and organismal tolerance to multiple stressors. As such, the crucial role of epithelia in organismal stress tolerance cannot be underestimated. At a molecular level, multiple cell-specific signalling pathways including cyclic cAMP, cyclic cGMP and calcium modulate tissue, and hence, organismal responses to stress. Thus, epithelial cell-specific signal transduction can be usefully studied to determine the molecular mechanisms of organismal stress tolerance in vivo. This review will explore cell signalling modulation of stress tolerance in insects by focusing on cell signalling in a fluid transporting epithelium--the Malpighian tubule. Manipulation of specific genes and signalling pathways in only defined tubule cell types can influence the survival outcome in response to multiple environmental stressors including desiccation, immune, salt (ionic) and oxidative stress, suggesting that studies in the genetic model Drosophila melanogaster may reveal novel pathways required for stress tolerance.",2014,"Shireen A Davies, Pablo Cabrero, Gayle Overend, Lorraine Aitchison, Sujith Sebastian, Selim Terhzaz, Julian A T Dow, Shireen A Davies, Pablo Cabrero, Gayle Overend, Lorraine Aitchison, Sujith Sebastian, Selim Terhzaz, Julian A T Dow"
Crystal structure of the dopamine N-acetyltransferase-acetyl-CoA complex provides insights into the catalytic mechanism,22716280,10.1042/BJ20120520,"The daily cycle of melatonin biosynthesis in mammals is regulated by AANAT (arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase; EC 2.3.1.87), making it an attractive target for therapeutic control of abnormal melatonin production in mood and sleep disorders. Drosophila melanogaster Dat (dopamine N-acetyltransferase) is an AANAT. Until the present study, no insect Dat structure had been solved, and, consequently, the structural basis for its acetyl-transfer activity was not well understood. We report in the present paper the high-resolution crystal structure for a D. melanogaster Dat-AcCoA (acetyl-CoA) complex obtained using one-edge (selenium) single-wavelength anomalous diffraction. A binding study using isothermal titration calorimetry suggested that the cofactor bound to Dat first before substrate. Examination of the complex structure and a substrate-docked model indicated that Dat contains a novel AANAT catalytic triad. Site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic studies and pH-rate profiles confirmed that Glu(47), Ser(182) and Ser(186) were critical for catalysis.

Willin lacks C-terminal sequences that are present in Expanded and, to date, little is known about the functional role of willin in mammalian cells. When willin is expressed in D. melanogaster epithelial tissues, it has the same subcellular localization as Expanded, but cannot rescue growth defects associated with expanded deficiency. However, we show that ectopic willin expression causes an increase in phosphorylation of the core Hippo signaling pathway components MST1/2, LATS1 and YAP, an effect that can be antagonized by ezrin. In MCF10A cells, loss of willin expression displays epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition features and willin overexpression antagonizes YAP activity via the N-terminal FERM domain of willin.

"Copy number variation and transposable elements feature in recent, ongoing adaptation at the Cyp6g1 locus",20585622,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000998,"The increased transcription of the Cyp6g1 gene of Drosophila melanogaster, and consequent resistance to insecticides such as DDT, is a widely cited example of adaptation mediated by cis-regulatory change. A fragment of an Accord transposable element inserted upstream of the Cyp6g1 gene is causally associated with resistance and has spread to high frequencies in populations around the world since the 1940s. Here we report the existence of a natural allelic series at this locus of D. melanogaster, involving copy number variation of Cyp6g1, and two additional transposable element insertions (a P and an HMS-Beagle). We provide evidence that this genetic variation underpins phenotypic variation, as the more derived the allele, the greater the level of DDT resistance. Tracking the spatial and temporal patterns of allele frequency changes indicates that the multiple steps of the allelic series are adaptive. Further, a DDT association study shows that the most resistant allele, Cyp6g1-[BP], is greatly enriched in the top 5% of the phenotypic distribution and accounts for approximately 16% of the underlying phenotypic variation in resistance to DDT. In contrast, copy number variation for another candidate resistance gene, Cyp12d1, is not associated with resistance.

Conservation of copper-transporting P(IB)-type ATPase function,20372979,10.1007/s10534-010-9332-2,"Copper-transporting P(IB)-type ATPases are highly conserved, and while unicellular eukaryotes and invertebrates have only one, a gene duplication has occurred during vertebrate evolution. Copper-induced trafficking of mammalian ATP7A and ATP7B from the trans-Golgi Network towards the plasma membrane is critical for their role in copper homeostasis. In polarized epithelial cells ATP7A and ATP7B traffic towards the basolateral and apical membranes respectively. We examined the localization and function of DmATP7, the single Drosophila melanogaster orthologue, in cultured D. melanogaster and mammalian cells to explore the conservation of P(IB)-type ATPase function. Comparative genomic analysis demonstrated motifs involved in basolateral targeting and retention of ATP7A were conserved in DmATP7, whereas ATP7B targeting motifs were not. DmATP7 expression was able to correct the copper hyper-accumulation phenotype of cultured fibroblasts from a Menkes disease patient expressing a null ATP7A allele. DmATP7 was able to transport copper to the cupro-enzyme tyrosinase and under elevated copper conditions DmATP7 was able to traffic towards the plasma membrane and efflux copper, essentially phenocopying ATP7A. When expressed in polarized Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells, DmATP7 translocated towards the basolateral membrane when exposed to elevated copper, similar to ATP7A. These results demonstrate DmATP7 is able to functionally compensate for the absence of ATP7A, with important trafficking motifs conserved in these distantly related orthologues.",2010,"Adam Southon, Nickless Palstra, Nicholas Veldhuis, Ann Gaeth, Charles Robin, Richard Burke, James Camakaris, Adam Southon, Nickless Palstra, Nicholas Veldhuis, Ann Gaeth, Charles Robin, Richard Burke, James Camakaris"

Derepression of Stellate genes in the absence of the Y chromosome or Y-linked crystal locus (crystal line) causes accumulation of abundant protein crystals in testes and different meiotic abnormalities, which lead to partial or complete male sterility. To understand the cause of abnormalities in chromosome behavior owing to Stellate overexpression, we studied subcellular localization of Stellate proteins by biochemical fractionation and immunostaining of whole testes. We showed that, apart from the known accumulation of Stellate in crystalline form, soluble Stellate was located exclusively in the nucleoplasm, whereas Stellate crystals were located mainly in the cytoplasm. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the alpha-subunit of the protein kinase CK2 (CK2alpha) was associated with soluble Stellate. Interaction between soluble Stellate and CK2alpha in the nucleus could lead to modulations in the phosphorylation of nuclear targets of CK2 and abnormalities in the meiotic segregation of chromosomes.

Odorant receptors from the light brown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana) recognize important volatile compounds produced by plants,19293399,10.1093/chemse/bjp010,"Moths recognize a wide range of volatile compounds, which they use to locate mates, food sources, and oviposition sites.

Like Drosophila melanogaster ORs, they contain 7 transmembrane helices with an intracellular N-terminus, an orientation in the plasma membrane opposite to that of classical GPCRs. EpOR2 is orthologous to the coreceptor Or83b from D. melanogaster. EpOR1 and EpOR3 both recognize a range of terpenoids and benzoates produced by plants. Of the compounds tested, EpOR1 shows the best sensitivity to methyl salicylate [EC(50) = 1.8 x 10(-12) M], a common constituent of floral scents and an important signaling compound produced by plants when under attack from insects and pathogens. EpOR3 best recognizes the monoterpene citral to low concentrations [EC(50) = 1.1 x 10(-13) M].

"Molecular evolution of the insect Halloween family of cytochrome P450s: phylogeny, gene organization and functional conservation",17628274,10.1016/j.ibmb.2007.02.012,"The insect molting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), is a major modulator of the developmental processes resulting in molting and metamorphosis. During evolution selective forces have preserved the Halloween genes encoding cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes that mediate the biosynthesis of 20E. In the present study, we examine the phylogenetic relationships of these P450 genes in holometabolous insects belonging to the orders Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera. The analyzed insect genomes each contains single orthologs of Phantom (CYP306A1), Disembodied (CYP302A1), Shadow (CYP315A1) and Shade (CYP314A1), the terminal hydroxylases. In Drosophila melanogaster, the Halloween gene spook (Cyp307a1) is required for the biosynthesis of 20E, although a function has not yet been identified. Unlike the other Halloween genes, the ancestor of this gene evolved into three paralogs, all in the CYP307 family, through gene duplication. The genomic stability of these paralogs varies among species. Intron-exon structures indicate that D. melanogaster Cyp307a1 is a mRNA-derived paralog of spookier (Cyp307a2), which is the ancestral gene and the closest ortholog of the coleopteran, lepidopteran and mosquito CYP307A subfamily genes. Evolutionary links between the insect Halloween genes and vertebrate steroidogenic P450s suggest that they originated from common ancestors, perhaps destined for steroidogenesis, before the deuterostome-arthropod split. Conservation of putative substrate recognition sites of orthologous Halloween genes indicates selective constraint on these residues to prevent functional divergence. The results suggest that duplications of ancestral P450 genes that acquired novel functions may have been an important mechanism for evolving the ecdysteroidogenic pathway.",2007,"Kim F Rewitz, Michael B O'Connor, Lawrence I Gilbert, Kim F Rewitz, Michael B O'Connor, Lawrence I Gilbert"

Investigating the effect of GTC on the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster, we observed that a 10 mg GTC/mL diet could prolong its 50% survival time by 36% and mean lifespan by 16%. This was consistent with 17% reduction in total body lipid hydroperoxide (LPO) level in GTC-treated flies compared to the control group.

Accordingly, SOD and catalase activities in OR wild type increased by 40 and 19%, respectively.

Here, we have identified target genes of the Hox protein Ultrabithorax (UBX), which modifies the genetic regulatory network of the wing to generate the haltere, a modified hindwing. We used whole-genome microarrays and custom arrays including all predicted transcription factors and signaling molecules in the Drosophila melanogaster genome to identify differentially expressed genes in wing and haltere imaginal discs. To elucidate the regulation of selected genes in more detail, we isolated cis-regulatory elements (CREs) for genes that were specifically expressed in either the wing disc or haltere disc. We demonstrate that UBX binds directly to sites in one element, and these sites are critical for activation in the haltere disc. These results indicate that haltere and metathoracic segment morphology is not achieved merely by turning off the wing and mesothoracic development programs, but rather specific genes must also be activated to form these structures.

      Variation in gene expression between two Drosophila melanogaster strains, as revealed by transcriptional profiling, seldom corresponded to variation in proximal promoter sequence for 34 genes analyzed. Two sets of protein-coding genes were selected from pre-existing microarray data: (1) those whose expression varied significantly and reproducibly between strains, and (2) those whose transcript levels did not vary. Only genes whose regulation of expression was uncharacterized were chosen. At least one kB of the proximal promoters of 15-19 genes in each set was sequenced and compared between strains (Oregon R and Russian 2b).
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Of the many promoter polymorphisms, 89.6% were SNPs and 10.4% were indels, including homopolymer tracts, microsatellite repeats, and putative transposable element footprints. More than half of the SNPs were changes within a nucleotide class. Hypothetically, genes differing in expression between the two strains should have more proximal promoter polymorphisms than those whose expression is similar. The number, frequency, and type of polymorphism, however, were the same in both sets of genes. In fact, the promoters of six genes with significantly different mRNA expression were identical in sequence.

Gene vector and transposable element behavior in mosquitoes,14506218,10.1242/jeb.00638,"The development of efficient germ-line transformation technologies for mosquitoes has increased the ability of entomologists to find, isolate and analyze genes. The utility of the currently available systems will be determined by a number of factors including the behavior of the gene vectors during the initial integration event and their behavior after chromosomal integration. Post-integration behavior will determine whether the transposable elements being employed currently as primary gene vectors will be useful as gene-tagging and enhancer-trapping agents. The post-integration behavior of existing insect vectors has not been extensively examined. Mos1 is useful as a primary germ-line transformation vector in insects but is inefficiently remobilized in Drosophila melanogaster and Aedes aegypti. Hermes transforms D. melanogaster efficiently and can be remobilized in this species. This element is also useful for creating transgenic A. aegypti, but its mode of integration in mosquitoes results in the insertion of flanking plasmid DNA. Hermes can be remobilized in the soma of A. aegypti and transposes using a common cut-and-paste mechanism; however, the element does not remobilize in the germ line. piggyBac can be used to create transgenic mosquitoes and occasionally integrates using a mechanism other than a simple cut-and-paste mechanism. Preliminary data suggest that remobilization is infrequent. Minos also functions in mosquitoes and, like the other gene vectors, appears to remobilize inefficiently following integration.

Correlated effects of sperm competition and postmating female mortality,11078508,10.1073/pnas.230305397,"Adaptations in one sex may impair fitness in the opposite sex. Experiments with Drosophila melanogaster have shown that seminal fluid from the male accessory gland triggers a series of postmating responses in the female, including increased egg laying rate and lower remating propensity, but that accessory gland proteins also increase female death rate. Here, we tested the relationships among the longevity of females mated to males from 51 chromosome-extracted D. melanogaster lines, male-mating ability, and sperm-competitive ability. We found significant differences in longevity of females mated to males of different genotypes, and all mated females showed a higher death rate than control virgin females shortly after mating. Both the age-independent mortality parameter (the intercept of the female's survival function) and the slope of the mortality rate curve were significantly correlated with the proportion of progeny sired by the first male to mate relative to tester males (sperm-defense ability, P1). No significant correlation was found between the proportion of progeny sired by the second-mating male relative to tester males (sperm-offense ability, P2) and any mortality parameter.

Heat shock proteins affect RNA processing during the heat shock response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,1899282,10.1128/mcb.11.2.1062,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the splicing of mRNA precursors is disrupted by a severe heat shock. Mild heat treatments prior to severe heat shock protect splicing from disruption, as was previously reported for Drosophila melanogaster. In contrast to D. melanogaster, protein synthesis during the pretreatment is not required to protect splicing in yeast cells. However, protein synthesis is required for the rapid recovery of splicing once it has been disrupted by a sudden severe heat shock. Mutations in two classes of yeast hsp genes affect the pattern of RNA splicing during the heat shock response. First, certain hsp70 mutants, which overproduce other heat shock proteins at normal temperatures, show constitutive protection of splicing at high temperatures and do not require pretreatment. Second, in hsp104 mutants, the recovery of RNA splicing after a severe heat shock is delayed compared with wild-type cells. These results indicate a greater degree of specialization in the protective functions of hsps than has previously been suspected. Some of the proteins (e.g., members of the hsp70 and hsp82 gene families) help to maintain normal cellular processes at higher temperatures. The particular function of hsp104, at least in splicing, is to facilitate recovery of the process once it has been disrupted.",1991,"H J Yost, S Lindquist, H J Yost, S Lindquist"

"Ribosomal RNA cistrons of X chromosomes clonally derived from D. melanogaster laboratory populations: redundancy, organization and stability",6428975,,"To determine whether heterogeneity exists in the organization or redundancy of the rRNA cistrons of inbred populations of Drosophila melanogaster, we have derived a number of sublines from the strains Oregon R and Canton S. These two strains were chosen because our previous studies have demonstrated a difference in the competence of these strains to exhibit a ""compensatory response"" of the rDNA. In each subline, the X chromosomes are descended from a single maternal X, that is, each line is homozygous for a particular nucleolus organizer (NO). These derivative lines have been characterized in terms of rDNA content and organization, using quantitative liquid hybridizations and Southern blot analyses, respectively. Our studies reveal that both of the highly inbred parent populations contained a heterogeneous array of X chromosomal rDNA contents. Once isogenized, the rDNA redundancy of a given X chromosomal NO can be shown to remain stable for at least 20 generations in culture. We detect no restriction pattern heterogeneity among X chromosomes isolated from a given strain, despite relatively large differences in their rDNA contents. This leads us to suggest that there is no significant clustering of intervening sequence-bearing (ivs+) genes within the rDNA loci of chromosomes from the populations examined. Furthermore, we conclude that apparent alterations in rDNA redundancy known as the compensatory response are not related to the heterogeneity of rDNA content within a population.",1984,"F L Dutton, H M Krider, F L Dutton, H M Krider"
Suppressor Systems of Segregation Distorter (SD) Chromosomes in Natural Populations of DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,17246192,,"Several natural populations of D. melanogaster were investigated for the presence (or absence) of the Segregation Distorter ( SD) chromosomes and their suppressor systems. The SD chromosomes were found, at frequencies of a few percent, in two independent samples taken in different years from a Raleigh, North Carolina, population, whereas no SD chromosomes were found in samples collected from several populations in Texas. The populations in these localities were found to contain suppressor X chromosomes in high frequencies (75% or higher). They also contained relatively low frequencies of partial suppressor or insensitive second chromosomes of varying degrees, but completely insensitive second chromosomes were practically absent in all populations examined. The frequencies of suppressor X chromosomes, as well as those of the partially insensitive or suppressor second chromosomes, were the same among the populations investigated. This suggests the possibility that the development of a suppressor system of SD in a population could be independent of the presence of an SD chromosome. Segregation distortion appeared to be occurring in natural genetic backgrounds, but the degree of distortion varied among males of different genotypes. There were many instances in which the SD chromosomes showed transmission frequencies from their heterozygous male parents that were smaller than 0.6 and, in several cases, even smaller than 0.5. The presence of a recessive suppressor, or suppressors, of SD in natural populations was suggested.",1984,"Y Hiraizumi, A M Thomas, Y Hiraizumi, A M Thomas"

Small Segmental Duplications in Drosophila-High Rate of Emergence and Elimination,30689862,10.1093/gbe/evz011,"Segmental duplications are an important class of mutations. Because a large proportion of segmental duplications may often be strongly deleterious, high frequency or fixed segmental duplications may represent only a tiny fraction of the mutational input. To understand the emergence and elimination of segmental duplications, we survey polymorphic duplications, including tandem and interspersed duplications, in natural populations of Drosophila by haploid embryo genomes. As haploid embryos are not expected to be heterozygous, the genome, sites of heterozygosity (referred to as pseudoheterozygous sites [PHS]), may likely represent recent duplications that have acquired new mutations. Among the 29 genomes of Drosophila melanogaster, we identify 2,282 polymorphic PHS duplications (linked PHS regions) in total or 154 PHS duplications per genome. Most PHS duplications are small (83.4% < 500 bp), Drosophila melanogaster lineage specific, and strain specific (72.6% singletons). The excess of the observed singleton PHS duplications deviates significantly from the neutral expectation, suggesting that most PHS duplications are strongly deleterious. In addition, these small segmental duplications are not evenly distributed in genomic regions and less common in noncoding functional element regions. The underrepresentation in RNA polymerase II binding sites and regions with active histone modifications is correlated with ages of duplications. In conclusion, small segmental duplications occur frequently in Drosophila but rapidly eliminated by natural selection.",2019,"Juan Li, Lan Jiang, Chung-I Wu, Xuemei Lu, Shu Fang, Chau-Ti Ting, Juan Li, Lan Jiang, Chung-I Wu, Xuemei Lu, Shu Fang, Chau-Ti Ting"
Expression of membrane proteins in the eyes of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster,25857784,10.1016/bs.mie.2014.12.012,"In recent years, improved protein expression and crystallization strategies, as well as advanced synchrotron radiation sources and crystallographic tools considerably increased the number of crystal structures of integral membrane proteins from higher eukaryotes. However, seen as a proportion of the total number of candidate proteins, these achievements still appear meager, reflecting the huge effort that is often required to obtain high-level and functional expression of eukaryotic membrane proteins. Besides bacteria, yeast, insect, or mammalian cells are frequently used for heterologous expression, but despite considerable investments in time, labor, and money, there are numerous drawbacks to these systems. Are there other strategies that allow for an effective, large-scale production of functional membrane proteins? This chapter describes the expression of proteins in photoreceptor cells of transgenic Drosophila as an easily accessible, versatile alternative. We present step-by-step protocols starting from the cloning of the target gene into a suitable vector for fly eye expression and ending with the harvest of transgenic Drosophila and subsequent protein purification from the eye. Our examples span a number of eukaryotic membrane proteins from different classes-including receptors, transporters, channels, and enzymes-that were successfully expressed without further optimization.

Drosophila and experimental neurology in the post-genomic era,25814441,10.1016/j.expneurol.2015.03.016,"For decades, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has been among the premiere genetic model systems for probing fundamental neurobiology, including elucidation of mechanisms responsible for human neurologic disorders. Flies continue to offer virtually unparalleled versatility and speed for genetic manipulation, strong genomic conservation, and a nervous system that recapitulates a range of cellular and network properties relevant to human disease. I focus here on four critical challenges emerging from recent advances in our understanding of the genomic basis of human neurologic disorders where innovative experimental strategies are urgently needed: (1) pinpointing causal genes from associated genomic loci; (2) confirming the functional impact of allelic variants; (3) elucidating nervous system roles for novel or poorly studied genes; and (4) probing network interactions within implicated regulatory pathways. Drosophila genetic approaches are ideally suited to address each of these potential translational roadblocks, and will therefore contribute to mechanistic insights and potential breakthrough therapies for complex genetic disorders in the coming years.

"Identification and characterization of a Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of human beta1,4-galactosyltransferase VII",12244071,10.1093/glycob/cwf074,"Drosophila melanogaster is widely considered to be an attractive model organism for studying the functions of the carbohydrate moieties of glycoconjugates produced by higher eukaryotes. However, the pathways of glycoconjugate biosynthesis are not as well defined in insects as they are in higher eukaryotes. One way to address this problem is to identify genes in the Drosophila genome that might encode relevant functions, express them, and determine the functions of the gene products by direct biochemical assays. In this study, we used this approach to identify a putative Drosophila beta4-galactosyltransferase gene and determine the enzymatic activity of its product. Biochemical assays demonstrated that this gene product could transfer galactose from UDP-galactose to a beta-xylosyl acceptor, but not to other acceptors in vitro. The apparent K(m) values for the donor and acceptor substrates indicated that this gene product is a functional galactosyltransferase. Additional assays showed that the enzyme is activated by manganese, has a slightly acidic pH optimum, and is localized in the insect cell Golgi apparatus. These results showed that Drosophila encodes an ortholog of human beta4-galactosyltransferase-VII, also known as galactosyltransferase I, which participates in proteoglycan biosynthesis by transferring the first galactose to xylose in the linkage tetrasaccharide of glycosaminoglycan side chains.",2002,"Nadia Vadaie, Rebecca S Hulinsky, Donald L Jarvis, Nadia Vadaie, Rebecca S Hulinsky, Donald L Jarvis"
Origin and evolution of the regulatory gene male-specific lethal-3,10908644,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026407,"Dosage compensation in Drosophila is mediated by genes known as ""male-specific lethals"" (msls). Several msls, including male-specific lethal-3 (msl-3), encode proteins of unknown function. We cloned the Drosophila virilis msl-3 gene. Using the information provided by the sequences of the Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis genes, we found that sequences of other species can be aligned along their entire lengths with msl-3. Among them, there are genes in yeasts (the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Alp13 gene, as well as a putative Alp13 homolog, found in Saccharomyces cerevisae) and in mammals (MRG15 and MSL3L1 and their relatives) plus uncharacterized sequences of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the plants Arabidopsis thaliana, Lycopersicon esculentum, and Zea mays. A second Drosophila gene of this family has also been found. It is thus likely that msl-3-like genes are present in all eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that msl-3 is orthologous to the mammalian MSL3L1 genes, while the second Drosophila melanogaster gene (which we have called Dm MRG15) is orthologous to mammalian MRG15. These analyses also suggest that the msl-3/MRG15 duplication occurred after the fungus/animal split, while an independent duplication occurred in plants. The proteins encoded by these genes have similar structures, including a putative chromodomain close to their N-terminal end and a putative leucine zipper at their C-terminus. The possible functional roles of these proteins are discussed.",2000,"I Marín, B S Baker, I Marín, B S Baker"
The sap47 gene of Drosophila melanogaster codes for a novel conserved neuronal protein associated with synaptic terminals,7494462,10.1016/0169-328x(95)00058-z,"Proteins expressed specifically in neurons and transported to synaptic terminals are likely to constitute important molecular elements of nervous system function. In an effort to characterize synapse-associated proteins (SAPs) of Drosophila, we have isolated from a hybridoma library several monoclonal antibodies (MABs) that selectively stain synaptic terminals in immunohistochemical preparations. MAB nc46 binds to most but not all synaptic terminals of the Drosophila nervous system, it also recognizes a protein with homologous distribution in other dipteran flies and binds to large parts of fish CNS. In Western blots the antibody labels a Drosophila brain protein of 47 kDa and cross-reacts with brain proteins from several species including insects, fish, mouse and man. From these data we conclude that the corresponding gene has been conserved in evolution at least among diptera. Using MAB nc46 and expression cloning we have identified the 'sap47' gene coding for the 'synapse-associated protein of 47 kDa' of Drosophila melanogaster. Sequence analysis of genomic and cDNA clones reveals the intron-exon structure of the gene and characterizes the complete open reading frames of two alternatively spliced transcripts.

This factor, with a molecular mass of about 90 kDa, consists of two subunits of 47 kDa and 39 kDa on dodecylsulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 39-kDa subunit is phosphorylated by the hemin-controlled inhibitor of rabbit reticulocytes in a terminal fragment which can be cleaved by mild treatment with trypsin. Drosophila elF-2 is not a substrate for protein kinases capable of phosphorylating the beta subunit of elF-2 from rabbit reticulocytes. It is also shown that Drosophila elF-2 can form a ternary complex with GTP and Met-tRNAi, which can be efficiently transferred to 40S ribosomes in the presence of AUG and Mg2+. This factor is able to form a binary complex with GDP. Furthermore, purified elF-2 contains about 0.3 mol bound GDP/mol suggesting a high affinity of the factor for this nucleotide. Data supporting the notion that this affinity is increased in the presence of Mg2+, which impairs the GDP/GTP exchange on elF-2, are presented. The properties of Drosophila elF-2 suggest that this factor may be susceptible to regulation by a mechanism like that operating on rabbit reticulocyte elF-2.",1987,"M G Mateu, O Vicente, J M Sierra, M G Mateu, O Vicente, J M Sierra"

Ultrastructural examination of the insemination reaction in Drosophila,8137397,10.1007/BF00318816,"The insemination reaction is a swelling of the female vagina caused by the male ejaculate.

Based on ultrastructural examination of the vaginal contents of five Drosophila species (D. mettleri, D. nigrospiracula, D. melanogaster, D. mojavensis, and D. hexastigma), we propose three terms to describe these vaginal structures: the sperm sac, the mating plug, and the true insemination reaction. Each term describes a distinct structure associated with a specific female postmating behavior.

Lineage tracing and functional analyses demonstrate that the majority of adult hemocytes are phagocytic macrophages (plasmatocytes) from the embryonic lineage that parallels vertebrate tissue macrophages. Surprisingly, we find no sign of adult hemocyte expansion. Instead, hemocytes play a role in relaying an innate immune response to the blood cell reservoir: through Imd signaling and the Jak/Stat pathway ligand Upd3, hemocytes act as sentinels of bacterial infection, inducing expression of the antimicrobial peptide Drosocin in respiratory epithelia and colocalizing fat body domains.

Here, we tested the effect of yeast quality in the larval diet on pre-adult development and adult weight, survival, reproduction and food preference. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was added in three forms in three treatments-live, heated or dried-to food used as the juvenile diet or was not added (empty treatment). Adults resulting from the larvae raised on these four juvenile diets were all maintained on a similar standard laboratory food diet. Our data indicate that yeast quality in the juvenile diet affects larva-to-pupa-but not pupa-to-adult-development.

The increased presence of NM in the environment warrants evaluation of potential harmful effects in order to protect both environment and human exposed populations. Although in vitro approaches are commonly used to determine potential adverse effects of NM, in vivo studies generate data expected to be more relevant for risk assessment. As an in vivo model Drosophila melanogaster was previously found to possess reliable utility in determining the biological effects of NM, and thus its usage increased markedly over the last few years.

In mammals and Drosophila, the detection of NaCl induces two different behaviors: low-salt concentrations provide an attractive stimulus, whereas high-salt concentrations are avoided. We identified the gene called serrano (sano) as being expressed in the sensory organs of Drosophila larvae. A transgenic reporter line showed that sano was coexpressed with Gr66a in a subset of gustatory neurons in the terminal organ of third-instar larvae. The disruption of sano gene expression in gustatory neurons led to the specific loss of high-salt concentration avoidance in larvae, whereas the detection of other attractive or aversive substances was unaffected. Moreover, using a cellular marker sensitive to calcium levels, Sano function was shown to be required for neuronal activity in response to high-salt concentrations. In these neurons, the loss of the DEG/ENaC channel PPK19 function also eliminated the cellular response to high-salt concentrations.

The Venus flytrap attracts insects by the release of volatile organic compounds,24420576,10.1093/jxb/ert455,"Does Dionaea muscipula, the Venus flytrap, use a particular mechanism to attract animal prey? This question was raised by Charles Darwin 140 years ago, but it remains unanswered. This study tested the hypothesis that Dionaea releases volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to allure prey insects. For this purpose, olfactory choice bioassays were performed to elucidate if Dionaea attracts Drosophila melanogaster. The VOCs emitted by the plant were further analysed by GC-MS and proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-MS). The bioassays documented that Drosophila was strongly attracted by the carnivorous plant. Over 60 VOCs, including terpenes, benzenoids, and aliphatics, were emitted by Dionaea, predominantly in the light. This work further tested whether attraction of animal prey is affected by the nutritional status of the plant. For this purpose, Dionaea plants were fed with insect biomass to improve plant N status. However, although such feeding altered the VOC emission pattern by reducing terpene release, the attraction of Drosophila was not affected. From these results it is concluded that Dionaea attracts insects on the basis of food smell mimicry because the scent released has strong similarity to the bouquet of fruits and plant flowers.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization with Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BACs) to mitotic heterochromatin of Drosophila,20809329,10.1007/978-1-60761-789-1_30,"The organization of eukaryotic chromosomes into euchromatin and heterochromatin represents an enigmatic aspect of genome evolution. Constitutive heterochromatin is a basic, yet still poorly understood component of eukaryotic genomes and its molecular characterization by means of standard genomic approaches is intrinsically difficult. Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes do not seem to be particularly useful to map heterochromatin sequences because the typical features of heterochromatin, organized as it is into a chromocenter, limit cytogenetic analysis. In contrast, constitutive heterochromatin has been well-defined at the cytological level in mitotic chromosomes of neuroblasts and has been subdivided into several bands with differential staining properties. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BAC) probes that carry large genomic portions defined by sequence annotation has yielded a ""revolution"" in the field of cytogenetics because it has allowed the mapping of multiple genes at once, thus rendering constitutive heterochromatin amenable to easy and fast cytogenetics analyses. Indeed, BAC-based FISH approaches on Drosophila mitotic chromosomes have made it possible to correlate genomic sequences to their cytogenetic location, aiming to build an integrated map of the pericentric heterochromatin.

The amnesiac gene is involved in the regulation of thermal nociception in Drosophila melanogaster,19995327,10.3109/01677060903419751,"Nociception is a mechanism fundamental to the ability of animals to avoid noxious stimuli capable of causing serious tissue damage. It has been established that in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel encoded by the painless gene (pain) is required for detecting thermal and mechanical noxious stimuli. Little is known, however, about other genetic components that control nociceptive behaviors in Drosophila. The amnesiac gene (amn), which encodes a putative neuropeptide precursor, is important for stabilizing olfactory memory, and is involved in various aspects of other associative and nonassociative learning. Previous studies have indicated that amn also regulates ethanol sensitivity and sleep. Here the authors show that amn plays an additional critical role in nociception. Their data show that amn mutant larvae and adults are significantly less responsive to noxious heat stimuli (greater than approximately 40 degrees C) than their wild-type counterparts. The phenotype of amn mutants in thermal nociception, which closely resembles that of pain mutants, was phenocopied in flies expressing amn RNAi, and this phenotype was rescued by the expression of a wild-type amn transgene. These results provide compelling evidence that amn is a novel genetic component of the mechanism that regulates thermal nociception in Drosophila.",2010,"Benjamin T Aldrich, Junko Kasuya, Matthew Faron, Hiroshi Ishimoto, Toshihiro Kitamoto, Benjamin T Aldrich, Junko Kasuya, Matthew Faron, Hiroshi Ishimoto, Toshihiro Kitamoto"
Regulation of fat cell mass by insulin in Drosophila melanogaster,19822665,10.1128/MCB.00675-09,"A phylogenetically conserved response to nutritional abundance is an increase in insulin signaling, which initiates a set of biological responses dependent on the species. Consequences of augmented insulin signaling include developmental progression, cell and organ growth, and the storage of carbohydrates and lipids. Here, we address the evolutionary origins of insulin's positive effects on anabolic lipid metabolism by selectively modulating insulin signaling in the fat body of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Analogous to the actions of insulin in higher vertebrates, those in Drosophila include expansion of the insect fat cell mass both by increasing the adipocyte number and by promoting lipid accumulation. The ability of insulin to accomplish the former depends on its capacity to bring about phosphorylation and inhibition of the transcription factor Drosophila FOXO (dFOXO) and the serine/threonine protein kinase shaggy, the fly ortholog of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Increasing the amount of triglyceride per cell also depends on the phosphorylation of shaggy but is independent of dFOXO. Thus, the findings of this study provide evidence that the control of fat mass by insulin is a conserved process and place dFOXO and shaggy/GSK3 downstream of the insulin receptor in controlling adipocyte cell number and triglyceride storage, respectively.",2009,"Justin R DiAngelo, Morris J Birnbaum, Justin R DiAngelo, Morris J Birnbaum"

The pleiotropic action of Rst is reflected by its complex and dynamic expression during the development of Drosophila. By an enhancer detection screen, we previously identified several cis-regulatory modules that mediate specific expression of the roughest gene in Drosophila developmental processes. To identify trans-regulators of rst expression, we used the Gal4/UAS system to screen for factors that were sufficient to activate Rst expression when ectopically expressed. By this method we identified the transcription factors Single-minded, Pointed.P1, and Su(H)-VP16.

In the case of Sim, we could show that it regulates rst expression in the embryonic midline, but not in the optic lobes. Mutagenesis of Sim consensus binding sites in the regulatory module required for rst expression in the embryonic midline, abolished rst expression; indicating that the regulation of rst by Sim is direct.",2005,"Holger Apitz, Martin Strünkelnberg, Heinz Gert de Couet, Karl-Friedrich Fischbach, Holger Apitz, Martin Strünkelnberg, Heinz Gert de Couet, Karl-Friedrich Fischbach"
Replacement by Drosophila melanogaster protamines and Mst77F of histones during chromatin condensation in late spermatids and role of sesame in the removal of these proteins from the male pronucleus,15988027,10.1128/MCB.25.14.6165-6177.2005,"Chromatin condensation is a typical feature of sperm cells. During mammalian spermiogenesis, histones are first replaced by transition proteins and then by protamines, while little is known for Drosophila melanogaster. Here we characterize three genes in the fly genome, Mst35Ba, Mst35Bb, and Mst77F. The results indicate that Mst35Ba and Mst35Bb encode dProtA and dProtB, respectively. These are considerably larger than mammalian protamines, but, as in mammals, both protamines contain typical cysteine/arginine clusters. Mst77F encodes a linker histone-like protein showing significant similarity to mammalian HILS1 protein. ProtamineA-enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), ProtamineB-eGFP, and Mst77F-eGFP carrying Drosophila lines show that these proteins become the important chromosomal protein components of elongating spermatids, and His2AvDGFP vanishes. Mst77F mutants [ms(3)nc3] are characterized by small round nuclei and are sterile as males. These data suggest the major features of chromatin condensation in Drosophila spermatogenesis correspond to those in mammals. During early fertilization steps, the paternal pronucleus still contains protamines and Mst77F but regains a nucleosomal conformation before zygote formation. In eggs laid by sesame-deficient females, the paternal pronucleus remains in a protamine-based chromatin status but Mst77F-eGFP is removed, suggesting that the sesame gene product is essential for removal of protamines while Mst77F removal is independent of Sesame.",2005,"Sunil Jayaramaiah Raja, Renate Renkawitz-Pohl, Sunil Jayaramaiah Raja, Renate Renkawitz-Pohl"
Spatiotemporal calcium signaling in a Drosophila melanogaster cell line stably expressing a Drosophila muscarinic acetylcholine receptor,12827518,10.1007/s10158-003-0024-2,"A muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR), DM1, expressed in the nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster, has been stably expressed in a Drosophila S2 cell line (S2-DM1) and used to investigate spatiotemporal calcium changes following agonist activation. Carbamylcholine (CCh) and oxotremorine are potent agonists, whereas application of the vertebrate M1 mAChR agonist, McN-A-343, results in a weak response. Activation of S2-DM1 receptors using CCh resulted in an increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) that was biphasic. Two distinct calcium sources were found to contribute to calcium signaling: (1) internal stores that are sensitive to both thapsigargin and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate and (2) capacitative calcium entry. Spatiotemporal imaging of individual S2-DM1 cells showed that the CCh-induced [Ca(2+)](i) transient resulted from a homogeneous calcium increase throughout the cell, indicative of calcium release from internal stores. In contrast, ionomycin induced the formation of a ""calcium ring"" at the cell periphery, consistent with external calcium influx.",2003,"D Cordova, V Raymond Delpech, D B Sattelle, J J Rauh, D Cordova, V Raymond Delpech, D B Sattelle, J J Rauh"
Distribution of metabotropic glutamate receptor DmGlu-A in Drosophila melanogaster central nervous system,11536189,10.1002/cne.1310,"L-glutamate is the excitatory neurotransmitter at neuromuscular junctions in insects. It may also be involved in neurotransmission within the central nervous system (CNS), but its function therein remains elusive. The roles of glutamatergic synapses in the Drosophila melanogaster CNS were investigated, with focus on the study of DmGluRA, a G-protein-coupled glutamate receptor. In a first attempt to determine the function of this receptor, we describe its distribution in the larval and adult Drosophila CNS, using a polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal sequence of the protein. DmGluRA is expressed in a reproducible pattern both in the larva and in the adult. In particular, DmGluRA can be found in the antennal lobes, the optic lobes, the central complex, and the median bundle in the adult CNS. However, DmGluRA-containing neurons represented only a small fraction of all CNS neurons. DmGluRA immunoreactivity was not detected at the larval neuromuscular junction nor in the body wall muscles. The correlations between DmGluRA distribution and previously described glutamate-like immunoreactivity patterns, as well as the implications of these observations concerning the possible functions of DmGluRA in the Drosophila CNS, are discussed.",2001,"A Ramaekers, M L Parmentier, C Lasnier, J Bockaert, Y Grau, A Ramaekers, M L Parmentier, C Lasnier, J Bockaert, Y Grau"
Mutation in pre-mRNA adenosine deaminase markedly attenuates neuronal tolerance to O2 deprivation in Drosophila melanogaster,11254668,10.1172/JCI11625,"O2 deprivation can produce many devastating clinical conditions such as myocardial infarct and stroke. The molecular mechanisms underlying the inherent tissue susceptibility or tolerance to O2 lack are, however, not well defined. Since the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is extraordinarily tolerant to O2 deprivation, we have performed a genetic screen in the Drosophila to search for loss-of-function mutants that are sensitive to low O2. Here we report on the genetic and molecular characterization of one of the genes identified from this screen, named hypnos-2. This gene encodes a Drosophila pre-mRNA adenosine deaminase (dADAR) and is expressed almost exclusively in the adult central nervous system. Disruption of the dADAR gene results in totally unedited sodium (Para), calcium (Dmca1A), and chloride (DrosGluCl-alpha) channels, a very prolonged recovery from anoxic stupor, a vulnerability to heat shock and increased O2 demands, and neuronal degeneration in aged flies. These data clearly demonstrate that, through the editing of ion channels as targets, dADAR, for which there are mammalian homologues, is essential for adaptation to altered environmental stresses such as O2 deprivation and for the prevention of premature neuronal degeneration.",2001,"E Ma, X Q Gu, X Wu, T Xu, G G Haddad, E Ma, X Q Gu, X Wu, T Xu, G G Haddad"
Innervation of the ring gland of Drosophila melanogaster,11223816,10.1002/1096-9861(20010319)431:4<481::aid-cne1084>3.0.co;2-7,"In insects, peptidergic neurons of the central nervous system regulate the synthesis of the main developmental hormones. Neuropeptides involved in this neuroendocrine cascade have been identified in lepidopterans and dictyopterans. Since these organisms are not suitable for genetic research, we identified peptidergic brain neurons innervating the ring gland in Drosophila melanogaster. In larvae of Drosophila, ecdysteroids and juvenile hormones are produced by the ring gland, which is composed of the prothoracic gland, the corpus allatum, and the corpora cardiaca. Using the GAL4 enhancer trap system, we mapped those neurons of the central nervous system that innervate the ring gland. Eleven groups of neurosecretory neurons and their target tissues were identified. Five neurons of the lateral protocerebrum directly innervate the prothoracic gland or corpus allatum cells of the ring gland and are believed to regulate ecdysteroid and juvenile hormone titers. Axons of the circadian pacemaker neurons project onto dendritic fields of these five neurons. This connection might be the neuronal substrate of the circadian rhythms of molting and metamorphosis in Drosophila. Most of the neurons presented here have not been described before.

This locus being one of the early chromosomal targets for ecdysone stimulation, may be induced to puff by the hormone. The gene is on a plasmid vector and it has been designated as pDm 63F. This recombinant molecule also maps to the early ecdysone inducible subregion 90B of Drosophila hydei chromosome 4. The cytological inspection of large number of chromosomal sets after in situ hybridization of the cloned DNA, locates the cloned sequence between bands 63F 2-4 according to Bridges map. Similarly, in Drosophila hydei the cloned DNA maps between subdivisions 90B 2-4 according to Berendes' map. In situ hybridization of the pDm 63F cloned DNA, directed to the nascent RNA rather than to the DNA, shows two to three times more silver grains over the corresponding regions when puffed than in the resting stage.

Signal peptides and signal peptidase in Drosophila melanogaster,6776130,10.1083/jcb.87.2.516,"Translation of poly(A)-containing RNA from the female fat body of Drosophila melanogaster in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system results in the synthesis of previtellogenin polypeptides (PVs) having higher apparent molecular weights (46,000 and 45,000) than the forms seen after an in vivo pulse labeling. However, when this RNA is translated in the presence of EDTA-stripped microsomal membranes from the dog pancreas, vitellogenin precursors are produced that, upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, comigrate with the in vivo forms (apparent molecular weights, 45,000 and 44,000). These processed forms are sequestered within the microsomal lumen, as evidenced by their insensitivity to trypsin digestion. Neither processing nor sequestration occur posttranslationally. In addition, a microsomal membrane fraction derived from Drosophila embryos is able to cotranslationally process the PVs as well as a murine pre-light chain IgG.

Feeding and the rhodopsin family g-protein coupled receptors in nematodes and arthropods,23264768,10.3389/fendo.2012.00157,"In vertebrates, receptors of the rhodopsin G-protein coupled superfamily (GPCRs) play an important role in the regulation of feeding and energy homeostasis and are activated by peptide hormones produced in the brain-gut axis. These peptides regulate appetite and energy expenditure by promoting or inhibiting food intake. Sequence and function homologs of human GPCRs involved in feeding exist in the nematode roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), and the arthropod fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster), suggesting that the mechanisms that regulate food intake emerged early and have been conserved during metazoan radiation. Nematodes and arthropods are the most diverse and successful animal phyla on Earth. They can survive in a vast diversity of environments and have acquired distinct life styles and feeding strategies. The aim of the present review is to investigate if this diversity has affected the evolution of invertebrate GPCRs. Homologs of the C. elegans and D. melanogaster rhodopsin receptors were characterized in the genome of other nematodes and arthropods and receptor evolution compared. With the exception of bombesin receptors (BBR) that are absent from nematodes, a similar gene complement was found. In arthropods, rhodopsin GPCR evolution is characterized by species-specific gene duplications and deletions and in nematodes by gene expansions in species with a free-living stage and gene deletions in representatives of obligate parasitic taxa. Based upon variation in GPCR gene number and potentially divergent functions within phyla we hypothesize that life style and feeding diversity practiced by nematodes and arthropods was one factor that contributed to rhodopsin GPCR gene evolution. Understanding how the regulation of food intake has evolved in invertebrates will contribute to the development of novel drugs to control nematodes and arthropods and the pests and diseases that use them as vectors.",2012,"João C R Cardoso, Rute C Félix, Vera G Fonseca, Deborah M Power, João C R Cardoso, Rute C Félix, Vera G Fonseca, Deborah M Power"
Intracellular fate of Francisella tularensis within arthropod-derived cells,19220402,10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01875.x,"Since transmission of Francisella tularensis into the mammalian host occurs via arthropod vectors such as ticks, mosquitoes, horseflies and deerflies, recent studies have established Drosophila melanogaster as an arthropod vector model system. Nothing is known about the intracellular fate of F. tularensis within arthropod-derived cells, and the role of this host-parasite adaptation in the evolution of this pathogen to infect mammals. In this report, we explored intracellular trafficking of F. tularensis ssp. novicida in D. melanogaster-derived S2 cells. First, we show that similar to the F. tularensis ssp. holarctica-derived LVS strain, F. tularensis ssp. novicida is highly infectious, replicates exponentially within S2 cells and within adult flies, and is fatal to adult fruit flies in a dose-dependent manner, while the iglC, iglD and mglA mutants are defective. Using electron and fluorescence microscopy-based phagosome integrity assays, we show that the wild-type strain escapes into the cytosol of S2 cells within 30-60 min post infection and by 6 h, 90% were cytosolic. In contrast, approximately 40-50% of the iglC and iglD mutants escape into the cytosol by 6 h while the other subpopulation becomes enclosed within multilamellar vesicles (MLVs). Pre-treatment of S2 cells with the autophagy inhibitor methyl adenine blocks formation of the MLVs and all the vacuolar subpopulation of the iglC and iglD mutant bacteria become enclosed within single membrane-surrounded vacuoles. Endocytic trafficking studies of F. tularensis within S2 cells show transient colocalization of the bacterial phagosome with D. melanogaster LAMP2-GFP fusion but not with lysosomes pre-loaded with fluorescent dextran. Our data show that MLVs harbouring the iglC mutant acquire Lamp2 and dextran while MLVs harbouring the iglD mutant exclude these late endosomal and lysosomal markers.

Complete transcriptome assembly and annotation of a critically important amphipod species in freshwater ecotoxicological risk assessment: Gammarus fossarum,32028177,10.1016/j.envint.2019.105319,"Because of their crucial role in ecotoxicological risk assessment, amphipods (Crustacea) are commonly employed as model species in a wide range of studies. However, despite their ecological importance, their genome has not yet been completely annotated and molecular mechanisms underlying key pathways, such as the serotonin pathway, in development of ecotoxicological biomarkers of exposure to neuroactive pharmaceuticals are still poorly understood. Furthermore, genetic similarities and discrepancies with other model arthropods (e.g., Drosophila melanogaster) have not been completely clarified. In this report, we present a new transcriptome assembly of Gammarus fossarum, an important amphipod species, widespread in Central Europe. RNA-Seq with Illumina HiSeq technology was used to analyse samples extracted from total internal tissues. We used the Trinity and Trinotate software suites for transcriptome assembly and annotation, respectively. The quality of this assembly and the affiliated targeted homology searches greatly enrich the molecular knowledge on this species. Because of the lack of publicly available molecular information on the serotonin pathway, we also highlighted sequence homologies and divergences of the genes encoding the serotonin pathway components of the well-annotated arthropod D. melanogaster, and Crustacea with the corresponding genes of our assembly. An inferior number of hits was found when running a BLAST analysis of both D. melanogaster and Crustacea mRNA sequences encoding serotonin receptors available in GenBank against the total assembly, compared to other serotonin pathway components. A lack of information on important components for serotonin biosynthesis and vesicle endocytosis (i.e., tryptophan hydroxylase and vesicular monoamine transporter) in Crustacea was also brought to light.

Parallel effects of the inversion In(3R)Payne on body size across the North American and Australian clines in Drosophila melanogaster,26881839,10.1111/jeb.12847,"Chromosomal inversions are thought to play a major role in climatic adaptation. In D. melanogaster, the cosmopolitan inversion In(3R)Payne exhibits latitudinal clines on multiple continents. As many fitness traits show similar clines, it is tempting to hypothesize that In(3R)P underlies observed clinal patterns for some of these traits. In support of this idea, previous work in Australian populations has demonstrated that In(3R)P affects body size but not development time or cold resistance. However, similar data from other clines of this inversion are largely lacking; finding parallel effects of In(3R)P across multiple clines would considerably strengthen the case for clinal selection. Here, we have analysed the phenotypic effects of In(3R)P in populations originating from the endpoints of the latitudinal cline along the North American east coast. We measured development time, egg-to-adult survival, several size-related traits (femur and tibia length, wing area and shape), chill coma recovery, oxidative stress resistance and triglyceride content in homokaryon lines carrying In(3R)P or the standard arrangement. Our central finding is that the effects of In(3R)P along the North American cline match those observed in Australia: standard arrangement lines were larger than inverted lines, but the inversion did not influence development time or cold resistance. Similarly, In(3R)P did not affect egg-to-adult survival, oxidative stress resistance and lipid content. In(3R)P thus seems to specifically affect size traits in populations from both continents. This parallelism strongly suggests an adaptive pattern, whereby the inversion has captured alleles associated with growth regulation and clinal selection acts on size across both continents.",2016,"M Kapun, C Schmidt, E Durmaz, P S Schmidt, T Flatt, M Kapun, C Schmidt, E Durmaz, P S Schmidt, T Flatt"
"MicroRNAs in the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis: extending Drosophilid miRNA conservation to the Tephritidae",26438165,10.1186/s12864-015-1835-3,"Background:
      
    

    
      The oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis, is an important plant pest species in the family Tephritidae. It is a phytophagous species with broad host range, and while not established in the mainland United States, is a species of great concern for introduction. Despite the vast amount of information available from the closely related model organism Drosophila melanogaster, information at the genome and transcriptome level is still very limited for this species. Small RNAs act as regulatory molecules capable of determining transcript levels in the cells. The most studied small RNAs are micro RNAs, which may impact as much as 30 % of all protein coding genes in animals.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We have sequenced small RNAs (sRNAs) from the Tephritid fruit fly, B. dorsalis (oriental fruit fly), specifically sRNAs corresponding to the 17 to 28 nucleotides long fraction of total RNA. Sequencing yielded more than 16 million reads in total. Seventy five miRNAs orthologous to known miRNAs were identified, as well as five additional novel miRNAs that might be specific to the genera, or to the Tephritid family. We constructed a gene expression profile for the identified miRNAs, and used comparative analysis with D. melanogaster to support our expression data. In addition, several miRNA clusters were identified in the genome that show conservancy with D. melanogaster. Potential targets for the identified miRNAs were also searched.

Studies of Drosophila melanogaster indicate that lifespan and the rate of senescence are influenced by many genes that have environment- and sex-specific effects. These studies also demonstrate that interactions among alleles (dominance) and loci (epistasis) are common, with the degree of interaction differing between the sexes and among environments. However, little is known about the genetic architecture of lifespan or mortality rates for organisms other than D. melanogaster. We studied genetic architecture of differences in lifespan and shapes of mortality curves between two populations of the seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus (South India and Burkina Faso populations). These two populations differ in various traits (such as body size and adult lifespan) that have likely evolved via host-specific selection. We found that the genetic architecture of lifespan differences between populations differs substantially between males and females; there was a large maternal effect on male lifespan (but not on female lifespan), and substantial dominance of long-life alleles in females (but not males). The large maternal effect in males was genetically based (there was no significant cytoplasmic effect) likely due to population differences in maternal effects genes that influence lifespan of progeny. Rearing host did not affect the genetic architecture of lifespan, and there was no evidence that genes on the Y-chromosome influence the population differences in lifespan. Epistatic interactions among loci were detectable for the mortality rate of both males and females, but were detectable for lifespan only after controlling for body size variation among lines. The detection of epistasis, dominance, and sex-specific genetic effects on C. maculatus lifespan is consistent with results from line cross and quantitative trait locus studies of D. melanogaster.",2004,"C W Fox, M E Czesak, W G Wallin, C W Fox, M E Czesak, W G Wallin"

Ror-family RTKs are characterized by the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains, highly related to those of the Trk-family RTKs, and by the extracellular Frizzled-like cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) and Kringle domains. Rors are evolutionally conserved among Caenorhabditis elegans, Aplysia, Drosophila melanogaster, Xenopus, mice, and humans. In D. melanogaster and mammals, pairs of structurally related Rors are found, while a single Ror protein is identified in C. elegans or Aplysia. In Aplysia and D. melanogaster, Rors are expressed exclusively in developing nervous systems. On the other hand, rather widespread expression of Rors was observed in C. elegans and mammals. Mutations in Ror of C. elegans cause inappropriate axon outgrowth as well as defects in cell migration and asymmetric cell division. It has also been reported that the nematode Ror possesses kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions. Mouse Rors, Ror1, and Ror2, are expressed mainly in migrating neural crest cells and mesenchymal cells, and Ror2-deficient mice exhibit skeletal abnormalities and ventricular septal defects in the heart. Although Ror1-deficient mice exhibit no apparent skeletal or cardiac abnormalities, Ror1/Ror2 double mutant mice show markedly enhanced skeletal and cardiac abnormalities compared with Ror2 mutant mice, indicating genetic interaction of Ror1 and Ror2. In humans, mutations within Ror2 have been found in two genetic skeletal disorders, recessive Robinow syndrome and dominant Brachydactyly type B (BDB), further emphasizing critical functions of Ror2 during developmental morphogenesis.

In addition, the toxic effect of broth filtrate was observed in vitro in a cell line of Bombyx mori. Czapek-Dox broth fortified with 1% yeast extract stimulated more rapid mycelial growth and correspondingly more toxin production in time. At 25-30 degrees C, metabolic toxin(s) was detected in broth via bioassay at about 4-5 days postinoculation when mycelial biomass reached 5 mg/ml (dry wt). At these temperatures, biological activity of the filtrate peaked at about 8-10 days when mycelial growth reached a maximum (10 mg/ml, dry wt). This suggests a positive relationship between toxic metabolite and mycelial production. After 10 days, the toxicity of the filtrate appeared to decline gradually. Pathogenicity symptoms of the metabolites developed slowly in both G. mellonella and D. melanogaster.

A novel arrangement of tandemly repeated genes at a major heat shock site in D. melanogaster,99245,10.1016/0092-8674(78)90345-8,"Three cloned segments of Drosophila melanogaster DNA have been isolated that derive from the major heat shock site at 87C in chromosome 3. Each of these segments contains sequences homologous to a class of polysomal poly(A)+ RNAs whose synthesis is induced by heat shock of cultured cells. A combination of R loop, heteroduplex and restriction fragment maps of these segments reveals that their RNA-homologous sequences are arranged in tandemly repeated units, each unit consisting of an alpha element (0.49 kb) joined to a beta element (1.10 kb). The polysomal RNAs homologous to these alphabeta units (1.59 kb) are distributed into three size classes exhibiting approximate lengths of 1, 2 and 3 kb. R loop mapping demonstrated that the sequence of the 2 kb RNA is alphabetaalpha, indicating that it, and presumably the 3 kb RNA, derive from transcripts covering more than one repeated unit. One of the cloned segments contains a variant repeat unit, alphagamma, located between two alphabeta units. This unit has the same alpha element, but the beta element has been replaced by a nonhomologous gamma element (0.87 kb). Analysis of the total D. melanogaster DNA indicates that the 87C locus contains at least 21 tandemly repeated units, twelve of which were identified as alphabeta units and six as alphagamma units. The 21 or more units are distributed among at least three different tandem arrays separated by different spacer regions, one of which is within a cloned segment. Sequences in the gamma element, but not those in the alpha or beta elements, are also found at 87A, which contains another heat shock site. The possible roles of the alphabeta-type RNAs and of the gamma sequences are discussed in the light of these results.",1978,"J T Lis, L Prestidge, D S Hogness, J T Lis, L Prestidge, D S Hogness"
Modelling Learning and Memory in Drosophila to Understand Intellectual Disabilities,32730949,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2020.07.034,"Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) include a large number of conditions such as Fragile X syndrome, autism spectrum disorders and Down syndrome, among others. They are characterized by limitations in adaptive and social behaviors, as well as intellectual disability (ID). Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing studies have highlighted a large number of NDD/ID risk genes. To dissect the genetic causes and underlying biological pathways, in vivo experimental validation of the effects of these mutations is needed. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is an ideal model to study NDDs, with highly tractable genetics, combined with simple behavioral and circuit assays, permitting rapid medium-throughput screening of NDD/ID risk genes. Here, we review studies where the use of well-established assays to study mechanisms of learning and memory in Drosophila has permitted insights into molecular mechanisms underlying IDs. We discuss how technologies in the fly model, combined with a high degree of molecular and physiological conservation between flies and mammals, highlight the Drosophila system as an ideal model to study neurodevelopmental disorders, from genetics to behavior.",2020,"Vittoria Mariano, Tilmann Achsel, Claudia Bagni, Alexandros K Kanellopoulos, Vittoria Mariano, Tilmann Achsel, Claudia Bagni, Alexandros K Kanellopoulos"
Wood-Based Cellulose Nanofibrils: Haemocompatibility and Impact on the Development and Behaviour of Drosophila melanogaster,31412664,10.3390/biom9080363,"Wood-based cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) offer an excellent scaffold for drug-delivery formulation development. However, toxicity and haemocompatibility of the drug carrier is always an important issue. In this study, toxicity-related issues of CNF were addressed. Different doses of CNF were orally administered to Drosophila and different tests like the developmental cycle, trypan blue exclusion assay, larva crawling assay, thermal sensitivity assay, cold sensitivity assay, larval light preference test, climbing behaviour, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction assay, adult phenotype, and adult weight were conducted to observe the impact on its development and behaviour. A haemocompatibility assay was done on the blood taken from healthy Wistar rats. In Drosophila, the abnormalities in larval development and behaviour were observed in the behavioural assays. However, the cytotoxic effect could not be confirmed by the gut staining and level of reactive oxygen species. The larvae developed into an adult without any abnormality in the phenotype. The CNF did cause loss of weight in the adult flies and did not cause much toxicity within the body since there was no phenotypic defect. Hemolysis data also suggested that CNF was safe at lower doses, as the data was well within acceptable limits. All these results suggest that cellulose nanofibres have no significant cytotoxic effects on Drosophila. However, the developmental and behavioural abnormalities suggest that CNF may act as a behavioural teratogen.",2019,"Pawan Kumar Mishra, Adam Ekielski, Sumit Mukherjee, Swetapadma Sahu, Saptarshi Chowdhury, Monalisa Mishra, Sushama Talegaonkar, Lubna Siddiqui, Harshita Mishra, Pawan Kumar Mishra, Adam Ekielski, Sumit Mukherjee, Swetapadma Sahu, Saptarshi Chowdhury, Monalisa Mishra, Sushama Talegaonkar, Lubna Siddiqui, Harshita Mishra"
Drosophila melanogaster As a Model Organism to Study RNA Toxicity of Repeat Expansion-Associated Neurodegenerative and Neuromuscular Diseases,28377694,10.3389/fncel.2017.00070,"For nearly a century, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has proven to be a valuable tool in our understanding of fundamental biological processes, and has empowered our discoveries, particularly in the field of neuroscience. In recent years, Drosophila has emerged as a model organism for human neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders.

mRNA-Associated Processes and Their Influence on Exon-Intron Structure in Drosophila melanogaster,27172210,10.1534/g3.116.029231,"mRNA-associated processes and gene structure in eukaryotes are typically treated as separate research subjects. Here, we bridge this separation and leverage the extensive multidisciplinary work on Drosophila melanogaster to examine the roles that capping, splicing, cleavage/polyadenylation, and telescripting (i.e, the protection of nascent transcripts from premature cleavage/polyadenylation by the splicing factor U1) might play in shaping exon-intron architecture in protein-coding genes. Our findings suggest that the distance between subsequent internal 5' splice sites (5'ss) in Drosophila genes is constrained such that telescripting effects are maximized, in theory, and thus nascent transcripts are less vulnerable to premature termination. Exceptionally weak 5'ss and constraints on intron-exon size at the gene 5' end also indicate that capping might enhance the recruitment of U1 and, in turn, promote telescripting at this location. Finally, a positive correlation between last exon length and last 5'ss strength suggests that optimal donor splice sites in the proximity of the pre-mRNA tail may inhibit the processing of downstream polyadenylation signals more than weak donor splice sites do. These findings corroborate and build upon previous experimental and computational studies on Drosophila genes. They support the possibility, hitherto scantly explored, that mRNA-associated processes impose significant constraints on the evolution of eukaryotic gene structure.",2016,"Gildas Lepennetier, Francesco Catania, Gildas Lepennetier, Francesco Catania"
The ecdysteroidome of Drosophila: influence of diet and development,26395481,10.1242/dev.124982,"Ecdysteroids are the hormones regulating development, physiology and fertility in arthropods, which synthesize them exclusively from dietary sterols. But how dietary sterol diversity influences the ecdysteroid profile, how animals ensure the production of desired hormones and whether there are functional differences between different ecdysteroids produced in vivo remains unknown. This is because currently there is no analytical technology for unbiased, comprehensive and quantitative assessment of the full complement of endogenous ecdysteroids. We developed a new LC-MS/MS method to screen the entire chemical space of ecdysteroid-related structures and to quantify known and newly discovered hormones and their catabolites. We quantified the ecdysteroidome in Drosophila melanogaster and investigated how the ecdysteroid profile varies with diet and development. We show that Drosophila can produce four different classes of ecdysteroids, which are obligatorily derived from four types of dietary sterol precursors. Drosophila makes makisterone A from plant sterols and epi-makisterone A from ergosterol, the major yeast sterol. However, they prefer to selectively utilize scarce ergosterol precursors to make a novel hormone 24,28-dehydromakisterone A and trace cholesterol to synthesize 20-hydroxyecdysone. Interestingly, epi-makisterone A supports only larval development, whereas all other ecdysteroids allow full adult development. We suggest that evolutionary pressure against producing epi-C-24 ecdysteroids might explain selective utilization of ergosterol precursors and the puzzling preference for cholesterol.",2015,"Oksana Lavrynenko, Jonathan Rodenfels, Maria Carvalho, Natalie A Dye, Rene Lafont, Suzanne Eaton, Andrej Shevchenko, Oksana Lavrynenko, Jonathan Rodenfels, Maria Carvalho, Natalie A Dye, Rene Lafont, Suzanne Eaton, Andrej Shevchenko"
Transcriptional regulation of the Drosophila melanogaster muscle myosin heavy-chain gene,17194628,10.1016/j.modgep.2006.11.007,"We show that a 2.6kb fragment of the muscle myosin heavy-chain gene (Mhc) of Drosophila melanogaster (containing 458 base pairs of upstream sequence, the first exon, the first intron and the beginning of the second exon) drives expression in all muscles. Comparison of the minimal promoter to Mhc genes of 10 Drosophila species identified putative regulatory elements in the upstream region and in the first intron. The first intron is required for expression in four small cells of the tergal depressor of the trochanter (jump) muscle and in the indirect flight muscle. The 3'-end of this intron is important for Mhc transcription in embryonic body wall muscle and contains AT-rich elements that are protected from DNase I digestion by nuclear proteins of Drosophila embryos. Sequences responsible for expression in embryonic, adult body wall and adult head muscles are present both within and outside the intron. Elements important for expression in leg muscles and in the large cells of the jump muscle flank the intron. We conclude that multiple transcriptional regulatory elements are responsible for Mhc expression in specific sets of Drosophila muscles.",2007,"Norbert K Hess, Phillip A Singer, Kien Trinh, Massoud Nikkhoy, Sanford I Bernstein, Norbert K Hess, Phillip A Singer, Kien Trinh, Massoud Nikkhoy, Sanford I Bernstein"
Expression of a functional Drosophila melanogaster N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) phosphate synthase gene: evidence for endogenous sialic acid biosynthetic ability in insects,11886840,10.1093/glycob/12.2.73,"In this study, we report the first cloning and characterization of a N-acetylneuraminic acid phosphate synthase gene from Drosophila melanogaster, an insect in the protostome lineage. The gene is ubiquitously expressed at all stages of Drosophila development and in Schneider cells. Similar to the human homologue, the gene encodes an enzyme with dual substrate specificity that can use either N-acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate or mannose 6-phosphate to generate phosphorylated forms of both the sialic acids, N-acetylneuraminic acid and 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid, respectively, when expressed in either bacterial or baculoviral expression systems. The identification of a functional sialic acid synthase in Drosophila indicates that insects have the biosynthetic capability to produce sialic acids endogenously. Although sialylation is widely distributed in organisms of the deuterstome lineage, genetic evidence concerning the presence or absence of sialic acid metabolism in organisms of the protostome lineage has been lacking.

Human homologue of the Drosophila melanogaster lats tumour suppressor modulates CDC2 activity,9988268,10.1038/5960,"We have previously used mosaic flies to screen for tumour suppressors or negative regulators of cell proliferation. The cellular composition of these flies resembles that of cancer patients who are chimaeric individuals carrying a small number of mutated somatic cells. One of the genes we identified is the large tumour suppressor gene, lats (also known as wts), which encodes a putative serine/threonine kinase. Somatic cells mutant for lats undergo extensive proliferation and form large tumours in many tissues in mosaic adults. Homozygous mutants for various lats alleles display a range of developmental defects including embryonic lethality. Although many tumour suppressors have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster, it is not clear whether these fly genes are directly relevant to tumorigenesis in mammals. Here, we have isolated mammalian homologues of Drosophila lats. Human LATS1 suppresses tumour growth and rescues all developmental defects, including embryonic lethality in flies. In mammalian cells, LATS1 is phosphorylated in a cell-cycle-dependent manner and complexes with CDC2 in early mitosis. LATS1-associated CDC2 has no mitotic cyclin partner and no kinase activity for histone H1. Furthermore, lats mutant cells in Drosophila abnormally accumulate cyclin A. These biochemical observations indicate that LATS is a novel negative regulator of CDC2/cyclin A, a finding supported by genetic data in Drosophila demonstrating that lats specifically interacts with cdc2 and cyclin A.",1999,"W Tao, S Zhang, G S Turenchalk, R A Stewart, M A St John, W Chen, T Xu, W Tao, S Zhang, G S Turenchalk, R A Stewart, M A St John, W Chen, T Xu"
The mitochondrial DNA of Drosophila melanogaster exists in two distinct and stable superhelical forms,410503,10.1016/0092-8674(77)90123-4,"We have studied the structure and replication of mitochondrial DNA from Drosophila melanogaster embryos, larvae, adult flies and two established tissue culture lines. The most striking observation is that the organism maintains at least two stable, distinct closed circular forms of mitochondrial DNA throughout development of the early embryo and in the adult fly. The major closed circular monomeric form comprises approximately 75% of the population and has a normal number of superhelical turns. In contrast, closed circular mitochondrial DNA isolated from Drosophila tissue culture cells is comprised almost entirely of molecules with the low superhelix density. We have been unable to detect the D loop form of mitochondrial DNA present in other eucaryotic systems, and find by electron microscope and pulse-chase labeling techniques that the time required to replicate Drosophila mitochondrial DNA is very short (less than 15 min) compared to the mouse L cell system (greater than 1 hr). We conclude that Drosophila mitochondrial DNA utilizes a replication mechanism different from that of other higher eucaryotes. We postulate that the maintenance of markedly different topological forms of mitochondrial DNA is most probably related to different demands for replication and transcription of the genome in these sources.",1977,"J L Rubenstein, D Brutlag, D A Clayton, J L Rubenstein, D Brutlag, D A Clayton"
Dissection and Immunofluorescent Staining of Mushroom Body and Photoreceptor Neurons in Adult Drosophila melanogaster Brains,29155751,10.3791/56174,"Nervous system development involves a sequential series of events that are coordinated by several signaling pathways and regulatory networks. Many of the proteins involved in these pathways are evolutionarily conserved between mammals and other eukaryotes, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting that similar organizing principles exist during the development of these organisms. Importantly, Drosophila has been used extensively to identify cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating processes that are required in mammals including neurogenesis, differentiation, axonal guidance, and synaptogenesis. Flies have also been used successfully to model a variety of human neurodevelopmental diseases.

Example data from both wild-type and mutant brains are shown along with a brief description of a scoring criteria for axonal guidance defects.

Transcriptome Profiling of Neurosensory Perception Genes in Wing Tissue of Two Evolutionary Distant Insect Orders: Diptera (Drosophila melanogaster) and Hemiptera (Acyrthosiphon pisum),29075833,10.1007/s00239-017-9814-8,"The neurogenesis and neuronal functions in insect wing have been understudied mainly due to technical hindrances that have prevented electrophysiology studies for decades. The reason is that the nano-architecture of the wing chemosensory bristles hampers the receptors accessibility of odorants/tastants to receptors in fixed setup, whereas in nature, the wing flapping mixes these molecules in bristle lymph. In this report, we analyzed the transcriptome of the wing tissue of two species phylogenetically strongly divergent: Drosophila melanogaster a generic model for diptera order (complete metamorphosis) and the aphid acyrthosiphon pisum, representative of hemiptera order (incomplete metamorphosis) for which a conditional winged/wingless polyphenism is under control of population density and resources. The transcriptome shows that extensive gene networks involved in chemosensory perception are active in adult wing for both species. Surprisingly, the specific transcripts of genes that are commonly found in eye were present in Drosophila wing but not in aphid. The analysis reveals that in the aphid conditional wing, expressed genes show strong similarities with those in the gut epithelia. This suggests that the epithelial cell layer between the cuticle sheets is persistent at least in young aphid adult, whereas it disappears after emergence in Drosophila. Despite marked differences between the two transcriptomes, the results highlight the probable universalism of wing chemosensory function in the holometabolous and hemimetabolous orders of winged insects.",2017,"Sandra Agnel, Martine da Rocha, Alain Robichon, Sandra Agnel, Martine da Rocha, Alain Robichon"
Analyzing Synaptic Modulation of Drosophila melanogaster Photoreceptors after Exposure to Prolonged Light,28287587,10.3791/55176,"The nervous system has the remarkable ability to adapt and respond to various stimuli. This neural adjustment is largely achieved through plasticity at the synaptic level. The Active Zone (AZ) is the region at the presynaptic membrane that mediates neurotransmitter release and is composed of a dense collection of scaffold proteins. AZs of Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) photoreceptors undergo molecular remodeling after prolonged exposure to natural ambient light. Thus the level of neuronal activity can rearrange the molecular composition of the AZ and contribute to the regulation of the functional output. Starting from the light exposure set-up preparation to the immunohistochemistry, this protocol details how to quantify the number, the spatial distribution, and the delocalization level of synaptic molecules at AZs in Drosophila photoreceptors. Using image analysis software, clusters of the GFP-fused AZ component Bruchpilot were identified for each R8 photoreceptor (R8) axon terminal. Detected Bruchpilot spots were automatically assigned to individual R8 axons. To calculate the distribution of spot frequency along the axon, we implemented a customized software plugin. Each axon's start-point and end-point were manually defined and the position of each Bruchpilot spot was projected onto the connecting line between start and end-point. Besides the number of Bruchpilot clusters, we also quantified the delocalization level of Bruchpilot-GFP within the clusters.

Characterization and tissue expression of acidic fibroblast growth factor binding protein homologue in Drosophila melanogaster,12801646,10.1016/s0378-1119(03)00550-x,"We have earlier reported a Drosophila protein, which aligned significantly with the amino acid sequence of the human acidic fibroblast growth factor intracellular binding protein (FIBP). In attempts to further elucidate the function of FIBP and its putative role in fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling we have cloned and characterized FIBP from Drosophila melanogaster (DrFIBP). Using comparative sequence analysis of Drosophila and human FIBP genes we demonstrate a remarkable conservation of their structural architecture suggesting that FIBP from vertebrates and insects are genuine homologues. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of FIBP mRNA from Drosophila revealed differential splicing by intron retention resulting in the production of three distinct FIBP transcripts. The retention of the intronic sequences introduces termination codons within the mature FIBP mRNA leading to premature termination of translation. Analysis of FIBP mRNA distribution in the fruit fly suggests that DrFIBP, like its mammalian homologue, is an abundant protein whose expression is maintained during embryonic, larval and adult stages. The spatial expression pattern investigated by whole mount embryo immunostaining reveals expression of FIBP in the developing tracheal system and in ventral midline cells, two known sites of FGF signaling in the fruit fly.",2003,"Elona Kolpakova, Tor Erik Rusten, Sjur Olsnes, Elona Kolpakova, Tor Erik Rusten, Sjur Olsnes"
Wolbachia interactions that determine Drosophila melanogaster survival,12449484,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb00123.x,"We have recently described a mutualistic symbiosis in which Wolbachia bacteria were shown to improve the fitness of some Drosophila melanogaster stocks. Wolbachia did not extend longevity in all Drosophila genotypes, even though 16s rDNA sequences indicated that our Drosophila stocks were infected with the same Wolbachia strain. Here, we use reciprocal hybrid crosses between two Drosophila strains, one that lived longer with Wolbachia (Z53) and one that did not (Z2), to investigate the inheritance of the survival phenotype and its dependence on the host genotype, sex, and mating conditions. Wolbachia's positive effects were more apparent in hybrid flies than in parental flies, ruling out exclusive maternal inheritance or the dependence of the survival phenotype on Wolbachia strain differences. The Wolbachia survival effects were more apparent in single-sex cages, where courtship and mating were not permitted. In these cages, nearly all flies with Wolbachia lived longer than uninfected flies, even though strain Z2 showed no Wolbachia effect in mixed-sex mating cages. We used comparisons between single- and mixed-sex cages to estimate the cost of reproduction for both sexes. Our data suggest that Wolbachia infection may increase the inferred cost of reproduction, particularly in males. Wolbachia can even produce a positive survival effect almost as large as the negative survival effect associated with reproduction.

The peroxiredoxin gene family in Drosophila melanogaster,11677042,10.1016/s0891-5849(01)00692-x,"Five peroxiredoxin genes have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster on the basis of a genome-wide search. Three of the genes (DPx-4156, DPx-4783, and DPx-5037) fall into the 2-Cys subgroup, while the other two (DPx-2540 and DPx-6005) belong to the 1-Cys subgroup. Using cDNAs, all five were expressed in E. coli and the purified recombinant proteins were shown to reduce H(2)O(2) in the presence of dithiothreitol. The three 2-Cys Prx were also shown to be active in the thioredoxin system and were, consequently, classified as thioredoxin peroxidases. Antisera raised against the DPx-4783 recombinant protein crossreacted with all family members and recognized protein species of the predicted sizes (22-27 kD). All five family members, when individually overexpressed in Drosophila S2 cells, conferred some resistance to H(2)O(2) treatment, as measured by cell viability. Functional diversification of the Drosophila peroxiredoxin family members was suggested by two lines of evidence: (i) the patterns of mRNA accumulation varied for the different genes during development and (ii) recombinant proteins fused to an epitope tag and overexpressed in Drosophila cells, differed in subcellular localizations--three proteins occurred in the cytosol, one was localized to the mitochondria, and one was found to be secreted.",2001,"S N Radyuk, V I Klichko, B Spinola, R S Sohal, W C Orr, S N Radyuk, V I Klichko, B Spinola, R S Sohal, W C Orr"
Mechanism of the fluorescent light induced suppression of Curly phenotype in Drosophila melanogaster,11536279,10.1002/bem.65,"A dominant mutation Curly (Cy), frequently used as a marker on the second chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster, was previously shown to be suppressed by several factors, including larval crowding, low temperature, and fluorescent light. While the first two factors affect this mutation only partially, fluorescent tube exposed flies exhibit an almost completely suppressed (wild type) phenotype. This suppressive effect is the result of a combination of the electric field and light, both factors being produced by common fluorescent tubes. In this study, experiments were carried out to clarify the basic mechanism of this unique phenomenon. Two fluorescent tube sensitive stages of Drosophila development were found in the second half of embryonic development and first half of the pupal stage. Riboflavin, which is administered to Drosophila larvae with yeast, and decomposed by light, seems to play a key role in this phenomenon. In a medium lacking riboflavin caused by light exposure, Cy expression is inhibited by the action of electric field. Positive results of experiments with lithium ions, which block the opening of Ca(2+) channels, support the hypothesis that electromagnetic fields may alter ion currents during ontogenic development of Drosophila, and thus influence, expression of the Cy gene. Also, fluorescent light induces an overexpression of a specific protein in the imaginal wing disc of Cy pupae.",2001,"J Pavelka, L Jindrák, J Pavelka, L Jindrák"
Molecular characterization of the lysosomal acid phosphatase from Drosophila melanogaster,8676866,10.1007/BF02174451,"In Drosophila, unlike humans, the lysosomal acid phosphatase (Acph-1) is a non-essential enzyme. It is also one of the most rapidly evolving gene-enzyme systems in the genus. In order to determine which parts of the enzyme are conserved and which parts are apparently under little functional constraint, we cloned the gene from Drosophila melanogaster via a chromosomal walk. Fragments from the gene were used to recover an apparently full-length cDNA. The cDNA was sub-cloned into a Drosophila transformation vector where it was under the control of the 5' promoter sequence of the hsp-70 gene. Three independent transformants were obtained; in each, Acph-1 expression from the cDNA was constitutive and not dependent on heat shock, as determined by densitometric analyses of the allozymic forms of the enzyme. The pattern of expression indicates the hsp-70 and endogenous Acph-1 promoters act together in some, but not all, tissues. The sequence of the cDNA was determined using deletions made with exonuclease III, and primers deduced from the cDNA sequence were used to sequence the genomic clone. Five introns were found, and putative 5' upstream regulatory sequences were identified.

Developmental regulation of an insulin-degrading enzyme from Drosophila melanogaster,3130628,10.1073/pnas.85.10.3469,"The precise mechanism by which insulin is degraded in mammalian cells is not presently known. Several lines of evidence suggest that degradation is initiated by a specific nonlysosomal insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). The potential importance of this insulin protease is illustrated by the fact that there is an IDE in Drosophila melanogaster Kc cells that shares both physical and kinetic properties with its mammalian counterpart. We now demonstrate that the IDE is present in other Drosophila cell lines and in the embryo, the larvae, the pupae, and adult tissues of the fruit fly. Further, the level of the IDE is developmentally regulated, being barely detectable in the embryo but elevated approximately 5-fold in the larvae and pupae and approximately 10-fold in the adult fly. The IDE levels in the cell lines are particularly high, at least 10-fold greater than in the adult fly. Analysis of Schneider L3 cells indicates that the addition of the Drosophila hormone ecdysone, which induces differentiation of the cells, causes a small but reproducible increase in the level of the IDE and the insulin-degrading activity. These results demonstrate that the IDE is evolutionarily conserved and that its expression is tightly regulated during differentiation of Drosophila. The particular pattern of developmental regulation suggests that the IDE plays a specific and critical role in the later stages of the life cycle of the fly.",1988,"M P Stoppelli, J V Garcia, S J Decker, M R Rosner, M P Stoppelli, J V Garcia, S J Decker, M R Rosner"

Leader RNA accumulated in Drosophila cell cytoplasm, but in low amounts, it was either free or associated to structures larger than the leader RNA-N protein complexes found in vertebrate cells. Only a few leader RNA copies migrated into the cell nucleus; no increase of this transport was observed at any time during the virus cycle. Viral RNAs complementary to the 3' end of the genome and ranging in size from the leader to several hundred nucleotides were found to accumulate in Drosophila cell cytoplasm. Their synthesis was inhibited in the presence of cycloheximide, which blocks all protein synthesis and VSV replication.

A role of the Trx-G complex in Cid/CENP-A deposition at Drosophila melanogaster centromeres,31203392,10.1007/s00412-019-00711-x,"Centromeres are epigenetically determined chromatin structures that specify the assembly site of the kinetochore, the multiprotein machinery that binds microtubules and mediates chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis. The centromeric protein A (CENP-A) and its Drosophila orthologue centromere identifier (Cid) are H3 histone variants that replace the canonical H3 histone in centromeric nucleosomes of eukaryotes. CENP-A/Cid is required for recruitment of other centromere and kinetochore proteins and its deficiency disrupts chromosome segregation. Despite the many components that are known to cooperate in centromere function, the complete network of factors involved in CENP-A recruitment remains to be defined. In Drosophila, the Trx-G proteins localize along the heterochromatin with specific patterns and some of them localize to the centromeres of all chromosomes. Here, we show that the Trx, Ash1, and CBP proteins are required for the correct chromosome segregation and that Ash1 and CBP mediate for Cid/CENP-A recruitment at centromeres through post-translational histone modifications. We found that centromeric H3 histone is consistently acetylated in K27 by CBP and that nej and ash1 silencing respectively causes a decrease in H3K27 acetylation and H3K4 methylation along with an impairment of Cid loading.",2019,"Lucia Piacentini, Marcella Marchetti, Elisabetta Bucciarelli, Assunta Maria Casale, Ugo Cappucci, Paolo Bonifazi, Fioranna Renda, Laura Fanti, Lucia Piacentini, Marcella Marchetti, Elisabetta Bucciarelli, Assunta Maria Casale, Ugo Cappucci, Paolo Bonifazi, Fioranna Renda, Laura Fanti"

Thanks to an ever-growing arsenal of genetic tools, an easily manipulated genome, and its winning disposition, Drosophila is now employed to study not only basic molecular mechanisms of pathogen recognition and immune signaling, but also the nature of physiological responses activated in the host by microbial challenge and how dysregulation of these processes contributes to disease. Here, we present a collection of methods and protocols to challenge the fly with an assortment of microbes, both systemically and orally, and assess its humoral, cellular, and epithelial response to infection. Our review covers techniques for measuring the reaction to microbial infection both qualitatively and quantitatively. Specifically, we describe survival, bacterial load, BLUD (a measure of disease tolerance), phagocytosis, melanization, clotting, and ROS production assays, as well as efficient protocols to collect hemolymph and measure immune gene expression. We also offer an updated catalog of online resources and a collection of popular reporter lines and mutants to facilitate research efforts.

Studying alcohol use disorder using Drosophila melanogaster in the era of 'Big Data',30992041,10.1186/s12993-019-0159-x,"Our understanding of the networks of genes and protein functions involved in Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) remains incomplete, as do the mechanisms by which these networks lead to AUD phenotypes. The fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is an efficient model for functional and mechanistic characterization of the genes involved in alcohol behavior. The fly offers many advantages as a model organism for investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms of alcohol-related behaviors, and for understanding the underlying neural circuitry driving behaviors, such as locomotor stimulation, sedation, tolerance, and appetitive (reward) learning and memory. Fly researchers are able to use an extensive variety of tools for functional characterization of gene products. To understand how the fly can guide our understanding of AUD in the era of Big Data we will explore these tools, and review some of the gene networks identified in the fly through their use, including chromatin-remodeling, glial, cellular stress, and innate immunity genes. These networks hold great potential as translational drug targets, making it prudent to conduct further research into how these gene mechanisms are involved in alcohol behavior.",2019,"Gregory L Engel, Kreager Taber, Elizabeth Vinton, Amanda J Crocker, Gregory L Engel, Kreager Taber, Elizabeth Vinton, Amanda J Crocker"
Genotype Influences Day-to-Day Variability in Sleep in Drosophila melanogaster,29228366,10.1093/sleep/zsx205,"Patterns of sleep often vary among individuals. But sleep and activity may also vary within an individual, fluctuating in pattern across time. One possibility is that these daily fluctuations in sleep are caused by the underlying genotype of the individual. However, differences attributable to genetic causes are difficult to distinguish from environmental factors in outbred populations such as humans. We therefore employed Drosophila as a model of intra-individual variability in sleep using previously collected sleep and activity data from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, a collection of wild-derived inbred lines. Individual flies had significant daily fluctuations in their sleep patterns, and these fluctuations were heritable. Using the standard deviation of sleep parameters as a metric, we conducted a genome-wide association study. We found 663 polymorphisms in 104 genes associated with daily fluctuations in sleep. We confirmed the effects of 12 candidate genes on the standard deviation of sleep parameters. Our results suggest that daily fluctuations in sleep patterns are due in part to gene activity.",2018,"Katherine J Wu, Shailesh Kumar, Yazmin L Serrano Negron, Susan T Harbison, Katherine J Wu, Shailesh Kumar, Yazmin L Serrano Negron, Susan T Harbison"

Drosophila melanogaster serves as a powerful organism to study the developmental control of DNA replication in various cell cycle contexts in a variety of differentiated cell and tissue types. Additionally, Drosophila has provided several developmentally regulated replication models to dissect the molecular mechanisms that underlie replication-based copy number changes in the genome, which include differential underreplication and gene amplification. Here, we review key findings and our current understanding of the developmental control of DNA replication in the contexts of the archetypal replication program as well as of underreplication and differential gene amplification.

Inhalation toxicity of indoor air pollutants in Drosophila melanogaster using integrated transcriptomics and computational behavior analyses,28621308,10.1038/srep46473,"We conducted an inhalation toxicity test on the alternative animal model, Drosophila melanogaster, to investigate potential hazards of indoor air pollution. The inhalation toxicity of toluene and formaldehyde was investigated using comprehensive transcriptomics and computational behavior analyses. The ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) based on microarray data suggests the involvement of pathways related to immune response, stress response, and metabolism in formaldehyde and toluene exposure based on hub molecules. We conducted a toxicity test using mutants of the representative genes in these pathways to explore the toxicological consequences of alterations of these pathways. Furthermore, extensive computational behavior analysis showed that exposure to either toluene or formaldehyde reduced most of the behavioral parameters of both wild-type and mutants. Interestingly, behavioral alteration caused by toluene or formaldehyde exposure was most severe in the p38b mutant, suggesting that the defects in the p38 pathway underlie behavioral alteration. Overall, the results indicate that exposure to toluene and formaldehyde via inhalation causes severe toxicity in Drosophila, by inducing significant alterations in gene expression and behavior, suggesting that Drosophila can be used as a potential alternative model in inhalation toxicity screening.",2017,"Hyun-Jeong Eom, Yuedan Liu, Gyu-Suk Kwak, Muyoung Heo, Kyung Seuk Song, Yun Doo Chung, Tae-Soo Chon, Jinhee Choi, Hyun-Jeong Eom, Yuedan Liu, Gyu-Suk Kwak, Muyoung Heo, Kyung Seuk Song, Yun Doo Chung, Tae-Soo Chon, Jinhee Choi"
Rab1 interacts with GOLPH3 and controls Golgi structure and contractile ring constriction during cytokinesis in Drosophila melanogaster,28100664,10.1098/rsob.160257,"Cytokinesis requires a tight coordination between actomyosin ring constriction and new membrane addition along the ingressing cleavage furrow. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying vesicle trafficking to the equatorial site and how this process is coupled with the dynamics of the contractile apparatus are poorly defined. Here we provide evidence for the requirement of Rab1 during cleavage furrow ingression in cytokinesis. We demonstrate that the gene omelette (omt) encodes the Drosophila orthologue of human Rab1 and is required for successful cytokinesis in both mitotic and meiotic dividing cells of Drosophila melanogaster We show that Rab1 protein colocalizes with the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex Cog7 subunit and the phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate effector GOLPH3 at the Golgi stacks. Analysis by transmission electron microscopy and 3D-SIM super-resolution microscopy reveals loss of normal Golgi architecture in omt mutant spermatocytes indicating a role for Rab1 in Golgi formation. In dividing cells, Rab1 enables stabilization and contraction of actomyosin rings. We further demonstrate that GTP-bound Rab1 directly interacts with GOLPH3 and controls its localization at the Golgi and at the cleavage site.

The deubiquitinase ataxin-3 requires Rad23 and DnaJ-1 for its neuroprotective role in Drosophila melanogaster,26007638,10.1016/j.nbd.2015.05.010,"Ataxin-3 is a deubiquitinase and polyglutamine (polyQ) disease protein with a protective role in Drosophila melanogaster models of neurodegeneration. In the fruit fly, wild-type ataxin-3 suppresses toxicity from several polyQ disease proteins, including a pathogenic version of itself that causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and pathogenic huntingtin, which causes Huntington's disease. The molecular partners of ataxin-3 in this protective function are unclear. Here, we report that ataxin-3 requires its direct interaction with the ubiquitin-binding and proteasome-associated protein, Rad23 (known as hHR23A/B in mammals) in order to suppress toxicity from polyQ species in Drosophila. According to additional studies, ataxin-3 does not rely on autophagy or the proteasome to suppress polyQ-dependent toxicity in fly eyes. Instead this deubiquitinase, through its interaction with Rad23, leads to increased protein levels of the co-chaperone DnaJ-1 and depends on it to protect against degeneration. Through DnaJ-1, our data connect ataxin-3 and Rad23 to protective processes involved with protein folding rather than increased turnover of toxic polyQ species.",2015,"Wei-Ling Tsou, Michelle Ouyang, Ryan R Hosking, Joanna R Sutton, Jessica R Blount, Aaron A Burr, Sokol V Todi, Wei-Ling Tsou, Michelle Ouyang, Ryan R Hosking, Joanna R Sutton, Jessica R Blount, Aaron A Burr, Sokol V Todi"
Genetic dissection of the Drosophila melanogaster female head transcriptome reveals widespread allelic heterogeneity,24810915,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004322,"Modern genetic mapping is plagued by the ""missing heritability"" problem, which refers to the discordance between the estimated heritabilities of quantitative traits and the variance accounted for by mapped causative variants. One major potential explanation for the missing heritability is allelic heterogeneity, in which there are multiple causative variants at each causative gene with only a fraction having been identified. The majority of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) implicitly assume that a single SNP can explain all the variance for a causative locus. However, if allelic heterogeneity is prevalent, a substantial amount of genetic variance will remain unexplained. In this paper, we take a haplotype-based mapping approach and quantify the number of alleles segregating at each locus using a large set of 7922 eQTL contributing to regulatory variation in the Drosophila melanogaster female head. Not only does this study provide a comprehensive eQTL map for a major community genetic resource, the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource, but it also provides a direct test of the allelic heterogeneity hypothesis. We find that 95% of cis-eQTLs and 78% of trans-eQTLs are due to multiple alleles, demonstrating that allelic heterogeneity is widespread in Drosophila eQTL. Allelic heterogeneity likely contributes significantly to the missing heritability problem common in GWAS studies.",2014,"Elizabeth G King, Brian J Sanderson, Casey L McNeil, Anthony D Long, Stuart J Macdonald, Elizabeth G King, Brian J Sanderson, Casey L McNeil, Anthony D Long, Stuart J Macdonald"

We report here on the in vivo analysis of Fcp1 function in Drosophila using transgenic lines in which the phosphatase production is misregulated. Fcp1 function is essential throughout Drosophila development and ectopic up- or downregulation of fcp1 results in lethality. The fly Fcp1 binds to specific regions of the polytene chromosomes at many sites colocalized with Pol II. In accord with the strong evolutional conservation of Fcp1: (1) the Xenopus fcp1 can substitute the fly fcp1 function, (2) similarly to its S. pombe homologue, Drosophila melanogaster (Dm)Fcp1 interacts with the RPB4 subunit of Pol II, and (3) transient expression of DmFcp1 has a negative effect on transcription in mammalian cells.

Here, we exploit the genetic tractability of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, a comparatively simple but useful model in which to elucidate conserved components of stress response pathways. We show that structures within the mushroom bodies and central complex, two distinct anatomical regions within the Drosophila brain, modulate behavioral responses to two different environmental stressors. Modification of behavioral output after exposure to these stressors was dependent on the sex, sexual maturity, and reproductive status of the animal. These parameters also affected whether a mutant Drosophila strain carrying specific defects within the mushroom bodies and/or central complex modified its response to stress relative to wild-type flies.

Circadian regulation of egg-laying behavior in fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster,16781727,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2006.05.001,"Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the neurogenetics of circadian clocks in fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster. Several pacemaker neurons and clock genes have now been identified and their roles in the cellular and molecular clockwork established. Some recent findings suggest that the basic architecture of the clock is multi-oscillatory; the clock mechanisms in the ventral lateral neurons (LN(v)s) of the fly brain govern locomotor activity and adult emergence rhythms, while the peripheral oscillators located in antennal cells regulate olfactory rhythm. Among circadian phenomena exhibited by Drosophila, the egg-laying rhythm is unique in many ways: (i) this rhythm persists under constant light (LL), while locomotor activity and adult emergence become arrhythmic, (ii) its circadian periodicity is much longer than 24h, and (iii) while egg-laying is rhythmic under constant darkness, the expression of two core clock genes period (per) and timeless (tim), is non-oscillatory in the ovaries. In this paper, we review our current knowledge of the circadian regulation of egg-laying behavior in Drosophila, and provide some possible explanations for its self-sustained nature.

A family of genes clustered at the Triplo-lethal locus of Drosophila melanogaster has an unusual evolutionary history and significant synteny with Anopheles gambiae,14573474,,"Within the unique Triplo-lethal region (Tpl) of the Drosophila melanogaster genome we have found a cluster of 20 genes encoding a novel family of proteins.

The family is also present in the sequenced genome of D. pseudoobscura, and homologs have been found in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and in four other insect orders, but it is not present in the sequenced genome of any noninsect species. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the cluster evolved prior to the divergence of Drosophila and Anopheles (250 MYA) and has been highly conserved since. The ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitutions and the high codon bias suggest that there has been selection on this family both for expression level and function. We hypothesize that this gene family is Tpl, name it the Osiris family, and consider possible functions. We also predict that this family of proteins, due to the unique dosage sensitivity and the lack of homologs in noninsect species, would be a good target for genetic engineering or novel insecticides.",2003,"Douglas R Dorer, Jamie A Rudnick, Etsuko N Moriyama, Alan C Christensen, Douglas R Dorer, Jamie A Rudnick, Etsuko N Moriyama, Alan C Christensen"

The predicted sequence of beta' is more closely related to the beta subunit of Drosophila and other metazoans than to the Stellate family of proteins, suggesting that it is a second regulatory subunit. In vitro reconstitution studies show that a GST-beta' fusion protein associates with the alpha subunit to generate a tetrameric complex with regulatory properties similar to those of the native alpha2beta2 holoenzyme.

We found no evidence for activation of basal hsp70 transcription by su(Hw) protein in cultured Drosophila cells but observed that it can repress heat shock-induced transcription. Repression occurred only when su(Hw) protein-binding sites were positioned between binding sites for proteins required for heat shock transcription.

Comparison of the gap segmentation gene hunchback between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis reveals novel modes of evolutionary change,2504581,,"We have cloned and sequenced a large portion of the hunchback (hb) locus from Drosophila virilis. Comparison with the Drosophila melanogaster hb sequence shows multiple strong homologies in the upstream and downstream regions of the gene, including most of the known functional parts. The coding sequence is highly conserved within the presumptive DNA-binding finger regions, but more diverged outside of them. The regions of high divergence are correlated with regions which are rich in short direct repeats (regions of high 'cryptic simplicity'), suggesting a significant influence of slippage-like mechanisms in the evolutionary divergence of the two genes. Staining of early D.virilis embryos with an hb antibody reveals conserved and divergent features of the spatial expression pattern at blastoderm stage. It appears that the basic expression pattern, which serves as the gap gene function of hb, is conserved, while certain secondary expression patterns, which have separate functions for the segmentation process, are partly diverged. Thus, both slippage driven mutations in the coding region, which are likely to occur at higher rates than point mutations and the evolutionary divergence of secondary expression patterns may contribute to the evolution of regulatory genes.",1989,"M Treier, C Pfeifle, D Tautz, M Treier, C Pfeifle, D Tautz"

Mouse fibroblasts, transfected with Drosophila YP2 genomic DNA inserted into the eucaryotic expression vector pSV2, secreted the fly protein in sulfated form. Analyses of Drosophila YP2 produced by the mouse cells showed that the features of sulfation of this protein were identical to those previously determined for YP2 isolated from flies. YP2 secreted from mouse fibroblasts was found to be exclusively sulfated on tyrosine residues. The stoichiometry of tyrosine sulfation was approximately 1 mol of sulfate/mol of YP2. Sulfate was linked to the same tyrosine residue as in YP2 isolated from flies, tyrosine 172.

To analyze the regulation of the alcohol dehydrogenase genes from these two species, their homologous alcohol dehydrogenase genes were cloned and introduced, via P element-mediated transformation, into the germ line of Drosophila melanogaster. Histochemical and electrophoretic analyses of larval transformants demonstrate that major differences in the tissue-specific levels of alcohol dehydrogenase production are characteristic of the alcohol dehydrogenase genes themselves. While these results do not directly address possible species-specific differences in the tissue distribution of trans-acting regulatory components, they indicate that demonstrable differences in cis-dominant regulatory information are sufficient to account for the observed regulatory variation.",1988,"M D Brennan, C Y Wu, A J Berry, M D Brennan, C Y Wu, A J Berry"

Application of the resulfuration procedure to crude extracts of Drosophila ma-l flies which slow pleiotropic deficiencies of xanthine dehydrogenase, aldehyde oxidase, and pyridoxal oxidase led to the emergence of xanthine dehydrogenase and aldehyde oxidase activities. Representatives of all the five known complementation groups of ma-l mutants were amenable to activation; 59-95% of wild type xanthine dehydrogenase activity and 1-7% of wild type aldehyde oxidase activity were reconstituted. Evidence for the identity of in vitro reconstituted xanthine dehydrogenase from ma-l mutants with wild type enzyme is presented.

Headcase is a Repressor of Lamellocyte Fate in Drosophila melanogaster,30841641,10.3390/genes10030173,"Due to the evolutionary conservation of the regulation of hematopoiesis, Drosophila provides an excellent model organism to study blood cell differentiation and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance. The larvae of Drosophila melanogaster respond to immune induction with the production of special effector blood cells, the lamellocytes, which encapsulate and subsequently kill the invader. Lamellocytes differentiate as a result of a concerted action of all three hematopoietic compartments of the larva: the lymph gland, the circulating hemocytes, and the sessile tissue. Within the lymph gland, the communication of the functional zones, the maintenance of HSC fate, and the differentiation of effector blood cells are regulated by a complex network of signaling pathways. Applying gene conversion, mutational analysis, and a candidate based genetic interaction screen, we investigated the role of Headcase (Hdc), the homolog of the tumor suppressor HECA in the hematopoiesis of Drosophila. We found that naive loss-of-function hdc mutant larvae produce lamellocytes, showing that Hdc has a repressive role in effector blood cell differentiation. We demonstrate that hdc genetically interacts with the Hedgehog and the Decapentaplegic pathways in the hematopoietic niche of the lymph gland. By adding further details to the model of blood cell fate regulation in the lymph gland of the larva, our findings contribute to the better understanding of HSC maintenance.",2019,"Gergely I B Varga, Gábor Csordás, Gyöngyi Cinege, Ferenc Jankovics, Rita Sinka, Éva Kurucz, István Andó, Viktor Honti, Gergely I B Varga, Gábor Csordás, Gyöngyi Cinege, Ferenc Jankovics, Rita Sinka, Éva Kurucz, István Andó, Viktor Honti"
Immune-inducible non-coding RNA molecule lincRNA-IBIN connects immunity and metabolism in Drosophila melanogaster,30633769,10.1371/journal.ppat.1007504,"Non-coding RNAs have important roles in regulating physiology, including immunity. Here, we performed transcriptome profiling of immune-responsive genes in Drosophila melanogaster during a Gram-positive bacterial infection, concentrating on long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes. The gene most highly induced by a Micrococcus luteus infection was CR44404, named Induced by Infection (lincRNA-IBIN). lincRNA-IBIN is induced by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in Drosophila adults and parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi in Drosophila larvae, as well as by the activation of the Toll or the Imd pathway in unchallenged flies. We show that upon infection, lincRNA-IBIN is expressed in the fat body, in hemocytes and in the gut, and its expression is regulated by NF-κB signaling and the chromatin modeling brahma complex. In the fat body, overexpression of lincRNA-IBIN affected the expression of Toll pathway -mediated genes. Notably, overexpression of lincRNA-IBIN in unchallenged flies elevated sugar levels in the hemolymph by enhancing the expression of genes important for glucose retrieval. These data show that lncRNA genes play a role in Drosophila immunity and indicate that lincRNA-IBIN acts as a link between innate immune responses and metabolism.",2019,"Susanna Valanne, Tiina S Salminen, Mirva Järvelä-Stölting, Laura Vesala, Mika Rämet, Susanna Valanne, Tiina S Salminen, Mirva Järvelä-Stölting, Laura Vesala, Mika Rämet"
Impact of Drosophila Models in the Study and Treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia,29986523,10.3390/ijms19071989,"Drosophila melanogaster has been for over a century the model of choice of several neurobiologists to decipher the formation and development of the nervous system as well as to mirror the pathophysiological conditions of many human neurodegenerative diseases. The rare disease Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is not an exception. Since the isolation of the responsible gene more than two decades ago, the analysis of the fly orthologue has proven to be an excellent avenue to understand the development and progression of the disease, to unravel pivotal mechanisms underpinning the pathology and to identify genes and molecules that might well be either disease biomarkers or promising targets for therapeutic interventions. In this review, we aim to summarize the collection of findings provided by the Drosophila models but also to go one step beyond and propose the implications of these discoveries for the study and cure of this disorder. We will present the physiological, cellular and molecular phenotypes described in the fly, highlighting those that have given insight into the pathology and we will show how the ability of Drosophila to perform genetic and pharmacological screens has provided valuable information that is not easily within reach of other cellular or mammalian models.",2018,"Véronique Monnier, Jose Vicente Llorens, Juan Antonio Navarro, Véronique Monnier, Jose Vicente Llorens, Juan Antonio Navarro"
Using doubly-labeled water to measure energy expenditure in an important small ectotherm Drosophila melanogaster,25269676,10.1016/j.jgg.2014.07.004,"Energy expenditure is a key variable in the study of ageing, and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a model organism that has been used to make step changes in our understanding of the ageing process. Standard methods for measurement of energy expenditure involve placing individuals in metabolic chambers where their oxygen consumption and CO2 production can be quantified. These measurements require separating individuals from any social context, and may only poorly reflect the environment in which the animals normally live. The doubly-labeled water (DLW) method is an isotope-based technique for measuring energy expenditure which overcomes these problems. However, technical challenges mean that the smallest animals this method has been previously applied to weighed 50-200 mg. We overcame these technical challenges to measure energy demands in Drosophila weighing 0.78 mg. Mass-specific energy expenditure varied between 43 and 65 mW·g(-1). These estimates are considerably higher than estimates using indirect calorimetry of Drosophila in small metabolic chambers (around 18 mW·g(-1)). The methodology we have established extends downwards by three orders of magnitude the size of animals that can be measured using DLW. This approach may be of considerable value in future ageing research attempting to understand the genetic and genomic basis of ageing.",2014,"Matthew D W Piper, Colin Selman, John R Speakman, Linda Partridge, Matthew D W Piper, Colin Selman, John R Speakman, Linda Partridge"
Promoter contribution to the testis-specific expression of Stellate gene family in Drosophila melanogaster,22425977,10.1016/j.gene.2012.03.023,"Testis-specific tandemly repeated Stellate genes are part of the Ste-Su(Ste) genetic system required for male fertility in Drosophila melanogaster. Stellate genes encode a functional homolog of the β-subunit of protein kinase CK2. Derepression of Stellate results in their over-expression, meiotic disturbances and male sterility. Stellate genes are represented by clustered copies in the X chromosome and carry promoters shared with another X-chromosome cluster, βNACtes genes, encoding putative β-subunits of the nascent polypeptide-associated complex. Using Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay, we revealed in the Stellate promoter three cis-acting elements, E-boxes, the loss of which greatly diminished the reporter gene expression in Drosophila testes. We identified that these E-boxes were recognized by helix-loop-helix protein, dUSF (Drosophila ortholog of mammalian USF) in testis nuclear extract. All three E-boxes were preserved in the promoters of both euchromatic and heterochromatic Stellate clusters. Two analogous E-boxes were detected in the promoters of 5'-copies of the duplicated βNACtes gene pairs, whereas the 3'-copies lacked these sites but possessed a new binding site for a testis protein distinct from dUSF.

Properties of Ca(2+) transport in mitochondria of Drosophila melanogaster,21984833,10.1074/jbc.M111.268375,"We have studied the pathways for Ca(2+) transport in mitochondria of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We demonstrate the presence of ruthenium red (RR)-sensitive Ca(2+) uptake, of RR-insensitive Ca(2+) release, and of Na(+)-stimulated Ca(2+) release in energized mitochondria, which match well characterized Ca(2+) transport pathways of mammalian mitochondria. Following larger matrix Ca(2+) loading Drosophila mitochondria underwent spontaneous RR-insensitive Ca(2+) release, an event that in mammals is due to opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP). Like the PTP of mammals, Drosophila Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release could be triggered by uncoupler, diamide, and N-ethylmaleimide, indicating the existence of regulatory voltage- and redox-sensitive sites and was inhibited by tetracaine. Unlike PTP-mediated Ca(2+) release in mammals, however, it was (i) insensitive to cyclosporin A, ubiquinone 0, and ADP; (ii) inhibited by P(i), as is the PTP of yeast mitochondria; and (iii) not accompanied by matrix swelling and cytochrome c release even in KCl-based medium.

Cell lineage tracing reveals the plasticity of the hemocyte lineages and of the hematopoietic compartments in Drosophila melanogaster,20483458,10.1016/j.molimm.2010.04.017,"Much of our knowledge on hematopoiesis, hematopoietic compartments, hematopoietic cell lineages and immunity has been derived from studies on the vertebrate immune system. The sophisticated innate immunity of insects, the phylogenetic conservation and the power of Drosophila genetics allowed the investigation of immune cell (hemocyte) lineage relationships in Drosophila melanogaster. The development of the hemocyte lineages in Drosophila is a result of a precisely regulated succession of intracellular and intercellular events, though the nature and extent of these interactions are not known. We describe here a cell lineage tracing system set up to analyze the development of hemocyte lineages and functionally distinct hemocyte subsets. This system allowed us to distinguish two major embryonic hemocyte lineages, the crq and Dot lineages, in two, physically separated compartments, the embryonic macrophages and the embryonic lymph gland. We followed the fate and development of these lineages in the construction of the larval hematopoietic compartments and during the cell-mediated immune response, the encapsulation reaction.

A clinally varying promoter polymorphism associated with adaptive variation in wing size in Drosophila,20074315,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04509.x,"Body size often shows adaptive clines in many ectotherms across altitude and latitude, but little is known about the genetic basis of these adaptive clines. Here we identify a polymorphism in the Dca (Drosophila cold acclimation) gene in Drosophila melanogaster that influences wing size, affects wing:thorax allometry and also controls a substantial proportion of the clinal wing-size variation. A polymorphism in the promoter region of Dca had two common alleles showing strong reciprocal clinal variation in frequency with latitude along the east coast of Australia. The Dca-237 allele increased towards the tropics where wing size is smaller. A within-population association study highlighted that an increase in the frequency of this allele decreased wing size but did not influence thorax size. A manipulated increase in the level of expression of Dca achieved through UAS-GAL4 was associated with a decrease in wing size but had no effect on thorax size. This was consistent with higher Dca expression levels in family lines with higher frequency of the Dca-237 allele. Genetic variation in the promoter region of the Dca gene appears to influence adaptive size variation in the eastern Australian cline of Drosophila melanogaster and accounts for more than 10% of the genetic variation in size within and between populations.",2010,"S W McKechnie, M J Blacket, S V Song, L Rako, X Carroll, T K Johnson, L T Jensen, S F Lee, C W Wee, A A Hoffmann, S W McKechnie, M J Blacket, S V Song, L Rako, X Carroll, T K Johnson, L T Jensen, S F Lee, C W Wee, A A Hoffmann"
Anatomy of the stomatogastric nervous system associated with the foregut in Drosophila melanogaster and Calliphora vicina third instar larvae,17960761,10.1002/jmor.10581,"The stomatogastric nervous system (SNS) associated with the foregut was studied in 3rd instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster and Calliphora vicina (blowfly). In both species, the foregut comprises pharynx, esophagus, and proventriculus. Only in Calliphora does the esophagus form a crop. The position of nerves and neurons was investigated with neuronal tracers in both species and GFP expression in Drosophila. The SNS is nearly identical in both species. Neurons are located in the proventricular and the hypocerebral ganglion (HCG), which are connected to each other by the proventricular nerve. Motor neurons for pharyngeal muscles are located in the brain not, as in other insect groups, in the frontal ganglion. The position of the frontal ganglion is taken by a nerve junction devoid of neurons. The junction is composed of four nerves: the frontal connectives that fuse with the antennal nerves (ANs), the frontal nerve innervating the cibarial dilator muscles and the recurrent nerve that innervates the esophagus and projects to the HCG. Differences in the SNS are restricted to a crop nerve only present in Calliphora and an esophageal ganglion that only exists in Drosophila. The ganglia of the dorsal organs give rise to the ANs, which project to the brain. The extensive conformity of the SNS of both species suggests functional parallels. Future electrophysiological studies of the motor circuits in the SNS of Drosophila will profit from parallel studies of the homologous but more accessible structures in Calliphora.",2008,"Roland Spiess, Andreas Schoofs, Hans-Georg Heinzel, Roland Spiess, Andreas Schoofs, Hans-Georg Heinzel"
Characterization of free endogenous C14 and C16 sphingoid bases from Drosophila melanogaster,13130120,10.1194/jlr.M300005-JLR200,"Sphingolipid metabolites function as signaling molecules in mammalian cells, influencing cell proliferation, migration, and death. Recently, sphingolipid signaling has been implicated in the regulation of developmental processes in Drosophila melanogaster. However, biochemical analysis of endogenous Drosophila sphingoid bases has not been reported. In this study, a rapid HPLC-based method was developed for the analysis of free sphingoid bases endogenous to Drosophila. Four molecular species of endogenous free sphingoid bases were observed in adult flies and identified as C14 and C16 sphingosine (Sph) and C14 and C16 dihydrosphingosine (DHS). The C14 molecular species were the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 94% of the total free sphingoid bases in adult wild-type flies. An Sph kinase (SK) mutant demonstrated significant accumulation of all four sphingoid bases, whereas a serine palmitoyltransferase mutant demonstrated low but detectable levels. When endogenous sphingoid bases were evaluated at different stages of development, the observed ratio of Sph to DHS increased significantly from early embryo to adulthood. Throughout development, this ratio was significantly lower in the SK mutant as compared with the wild-type. This is the first report describing analysis of free C14 and C16 sphingoid bases from Drosophila. The biochemical characterization of these lipids from mutant models of sphingolipid metabolism should greatly facilitate the analysis of the biological significance of these signaling molecules.",2004,"Henrik Fyrst, Deron R Herr, Greg L Harris, Julie D Saba, Henrik Fyrst, Deron R Herr, Greg L Harris, Julie D Saba"
Zwitterionic and acidic glycosphingolipids of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo,10848971,10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01383.x,"Defining glycosphingolipid structures in species amenable to genetic manipulation, such as Drosophila melanogaster, provides a foundation for investigating mechanisms that regulate glycolipid expression. Therefore, eight of the 12 major glycosphingolipids, accounting for 64% of lipid-linked carbohydrate in Drosophila embryos, were purified after separation into acidic and zwitterionic pools. The zwitterionic lipids possess phosphoethanolamine (PEtn) linked to one or more GlcNAc residues and comprise a family of serially related structures. The longest characterized glycolipid, an octaosylceramide, designated Nz28, has the structure: GalNAcbeta, 4(PEtn-6)GlcNAcbeta,3Galbeta,3GalNAcalpha,4Ga lNAcbeta, 4(PEtn-6)GlcNAcbeta,3Manbeta,4GlcbetaCer. Heptaosyl (Nz7), hexaosyl (Nz6), pentaosyl (Nz5) and tetraosyl (Nz4) forms of Nz28, sequentially truncated from the nonreducing terminus, possess only one PEtn moiety. The major acidic lipid, designated Az29, possesses two PEtn moieties and a glucuronic acid linked to a Gal-extended Nz28. Two other acidic glycolipids, Az9 and Az6, exhibit one PEtn moiety and the same hexose and N-acetylhexosamine composition as Az29 and Nz6, respectively. The fully extended Drosophila core oligosaccharide differs from that of other dipterans in the linkage at a single glycosidic bond, a distinction with significant structural and biosynthetic consequences. Furthermore, acidic species account for a larger proportion of total glycosphingolipid, and PEtn substitution of GlcNAc is more complete in the Drosophila embryo.

A microinjection technique using Drosophila melanogaster for bioassay-guided isolation of neurotoxins in arthropod venoms,8866612,10.1016/0041-0101(95)00107-7,"Modern analytical techniques permit isolation and structural determination of neurotoxins at the picomole level. However, bioassay-guided fractionation of the sample often relies on simple injection assays using insects, vertebrates or crustaceans of a fairly large size, thus consuming quite a large amount of the samples being investigated. In order to investigate samples of very small size, we have devised an insect microinjection method using glass micropipettes and Drosophila melanogaster adults as test insects. The validity of the method was tested with a series of six buthoid scorpion venoms (Androctonus australis, Buthotus judaicus, Buthus tamulus, Centruroides sculpturatus, Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus, Tityus serrulatus) and one chactoid scorpion (Scorpio maurus palmatus) as standards. The LD50S of the venoms were determined using both the microinjection method and a classical injection assay with crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) as test insects. Results demonstrated that the new method can successfully be applied to the study of insect neurotoxic activity in arthropod venoms. The Gryllus:Drosophila ratio in amount of sample utilized is 100. However, for all Buthoid venoms tested, except L. quinquestriatus, Drosophila showed less sensitivity, thus reducing the gain by a factor of 2-10. Drosophila were several times more sensitive to the only chactoid venom tested. These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using this microtechnique, when limited amounts of material are available for both chemical and biological work.",1995,"P Escoubas, M F Palma, T Nakajima, P Escoubas, M F Palma, T Nakajima"
Double strand DNA cleavage by type II DNA topoisomerase from Drosophila melanogaster,6305984,,"The purified type II DNA topoisomerase from the embryos of Drosophila melanogaster exists in its native form as a dimer of 170,000-dalton polypeptides. In addition to the 170,000-dalton polypeptides, 3 polypeptides with molecular weights of 151,000, 141,000, and 132,000 were resolved when the enzyme was analyzed by electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. All four polypeptides can participate in the topoisomerase cleavage reaction and form covalent complexes with the cleaved DNA. Furthermore, immunochemical and biochemical data showed that they are structurally related and, therefore, the smaller polypeptides are likely generated from the 170,000-dalton polypeptide by proteolysis. The double strand DNA cleavage reaction of Drosophila topoisomerase has different site specificity from the Escherichia coli DNA gyrase-effected reaction. However, they result in an identical DNA structure at the cleavage site, which is a staggered double strand break with 4-nucleotide long 5'-protruding ends. The 3'-ends at the site of cleavage by Drosophila topoisomerase II have free hydroxyl groups and can be extended by exactly 4 nucleotides with T4 DNA polymerase, while the 5'-ends are covalently linked to the topoisomerase molecules. This similarity in cleavage site structure for Drosophila topoisomerase II and E. coli DNA gyrase suggests that they share some fundamental features in their mechanism of action.",1983,"M Sander, T Hsieh, M Sander, T Hsieh"
Pesticide-induced complete and partial chromosome loss in screens with repair-defective females of Drosophila melanogaster,6418539,10.1002/em.2860050608,"Commercial preparation of fungicides (captan and maneb), herbicides (bromacil, paraquat, picloram, and 2,4-D), and insecticides (carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, DDT, diazinon, carbofuran, and permethrin) were tested for their ability to induce complete and partial chromosome losses in Drosophila melanogaster males. In an attempt to identify the mutagenic activity of pesticides that are toxic in low concentrations in Drosophila, these males were mated with mus-302 repair-defective females. The rationale for this mating scheme is based on the repair of genetic damage in Drosophila sperm by maternal enzymes in the zygote, and on the reports that there may be increases in the frequency of recovery of chemically induced chromosome losses in crosses of treated males with mus-302 females. Verification of the sensitivity of this screen in this study came from significant increases in the frequency of chromosome loss induced by low concentrations of the positive controls, N-nitrosodimethylamine and methyl methanesulfonate. Of the 13 pesticides, the insecticide chlorpyrifos induced a significant amount of ring-X chromosome loss. No pesticide induced a significant increase in partial chromosome loss.

Dual-layer transposon repression in heads of Drosophila melanogaster,30217866,10.1261/rna.067173.118,"piRNA-mediated repression of transposable elements (TE) in the germline limits the accumulation of mutations caused by their transposition. It is not clear whether the piRNA pathway plays a role in adult, nongonadal tissues in Drosophila melanogaster. To address this question, we analyzed the small RNA content of adult Drosophila melanogaster heads. We found that the varying amount of piRNA-sized, ping-pong positive molecules in heads correlates with contamination by gonadal tissue during RNA extraction, suggesting that most of the piRNAs detected in heads originate from gonads. We next sequenced the heads of wild-type and piwi mutants to address whether piwi loss of function would affect the low amount of piRNA-sized, ping-pong negative molecules that are still detected in heads hand-checked to avoid gonadal contamination. We find that loss of piwi does not significantly affect these 24-28 nt RNAs. Instead, we observe increased siRNA levels against the majority of Drosophila TE families. To determine the effect of this siRNA level change on transposon expression, we sequenced the transcriptome of wild-type, piwi, dicer-2 and piwi, dicer-2 double-mutant heads. We find that RNA expression levels of the majority of TE in piwi or dicer-2 mutants remain unchanged and that TE transcripts increase only in piwi, dicer-2 double-mutants. These results lead us to suggest a dual-layer model for TE repression in adult somatic tissues. Piwi-mediated gene silencing established during embryogenesis constitutes the first layer of TE repression whereas Dicer-2-dependent siRNA-mediated silencing provides a backup mechanism to repress TEs that escape silencing by Piwi.",2018,"Marius van den Beek, Bruno da Silva, Juliette Pouch, Mohammed El Amine Ali Chaouche, Clément Carré, Christophe Antoniewski, Marius van den Beek, Bruno da Silva, Juliette Pouch, Mohammed El Amine Ali Chaouche, Clément Carré, Christophe Antoniewski"
"Maternal Proteins That Are Phosphoregulated upon Egg Activation Include Crucial Factors for Oogenesis, Egg Activation and Embryogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster",30012668,10.1534/g3.118.200578,"Egg activation is essential for the successful transition from a mature oocyte to a developmentally competent egg. It consists of a series of events including the resumption and completion of meiosis, initiation of translation of some maternal mRNAs and destruction of others, and changes to the vitelline envelope. This major change of cell state is accompanied by large scale alteration in the oocyte's phosphoproteome. We hypothesize that the cohort of proteins that are subject to phosphoregulation during egg activation are functionally important for processes before, during, or soon after this transition, potentially uniquely or as proteins carrying out essential cellular functions like those they do in other (somatic) cells. In this study, we used germline-specific RNAi to examine the function of 189 maternal proteins that are phosphoregulated during egg activation in Drosophila melanogaster We identified 53 genes whose knockdown reduced or abolished egg production and caused a range of defects in ovarian morphology, as well as 51 genes whose knockdown led to significant impairment or abolishment of the egg hatchability. We observed different stages of developmental arrest in the embryos and various defects in spindle morphology and aberrant centrosome activities in the early arrested embryos. Our results, validated by the detection of multiple genes with previously-documented maternal effect phenotypes among the proteins we tested, revealed 15 genes with newly discovered roles in egg activation and early embryogenesis in Drosophila. Given that protein phosphoregulation is a conserved characteristic of this developmental transition, we suggest that the phosphoregulated proteins may provide a rich pool of candidates for the identification of important players in the egg-to-embryo transition.",2018,"Zijing Zhang, Amber R Krauchunas, Stephanie Huang, Mariana F Wolfner, Zijing Zhang, Amber R Krauchunas, Stephanie Huang, Mariana F Wolfner"
Huntingtin's function in axonal transport is conserved in Drosophila melanogaster,23555909,10.1371/journal.pone.0060162,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by an abnormal polyglutamine expansion in the N-terminal part of the huntingtin (HTT) protein. HTT is a large scaffold protein that interacts with more than a hundred proteins and is probably involved in several cellular functions. The mutation is dominant, and is thought to confer new and toxic functions to the protein. However, there is emerging evidence that the mutation also alters HTT's normal functions. Therefore, HD models need to recapitulate this duality if they are to be relevant. Drosophila melanogaster is a useful in vivo model, widely used to study HD through the overexpression of full-length or N-terminal fragments of mutant human HTT. However, it is unclear whether Drosophila huntingtin (DmHTT) shares functions similar to the mammalian HTT. Here, we used various complementary approaches to analyze the function of DmHTT in fast axonal transport. We show that DmHTT interacts with the molecular motor dynein, associates with vesicles and co-sediments with microtubules. DmHTT co-localizes with Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-containing vesicles in rat cortical neurons and partially replaces mammalian HTT in a fast axonal transport assay. DmHTT-KO flies show a reduced fast axonal transport of synaptotagmin vesicles in motoneurons in vivo. These results suggest that the function of HTT in axonal transport is conserved between flies and mammals. Our study therefore validates Drosophila melanogaster as a model to study HTT function, and its dysfunction associated with HD.",2013,"Diana Zala, Maria-Victoria Hinckelmann, Frédéric Saudou, Diana Zala, Maria-Victoria Hinckelmann, Frédéric Saudou"
Plastic male mating behavior evolves in response to the competitive environment,32844404,10.1111/evo.14089,"Male reproductive phenotypes can evolve in response to the social and sexual environment. The expression of many such phenotypes may also be plastic within an individual's lifetime. For example, male Drosophila melanogaster show significantly extended mating duration following a period of exposure to conspecific male rivals. The costs and benefits of reproductive investment, and plasticity itself, can be shaped by the prevailing sociosexual environment and by resource availability. We investigated these ideas using experimental evolution lines of D. melanogaster evolving under three fixed sex ratios (high, medium, and low male-male competition) on either rich or poor adult diets. We found that males evolving in high-competition environments evolved longer mating durations overall. In addition, these males expressed a novel type of plastic behavioral response following exposure to rival males: they both significantly reduced and showed altered courtship delivery, and exhibited significantly longer mating latencies. Plasticity in male mating duration in response to rivals was maintained in all of the lines, suggesting that the costs of plasticity were minimal. None of the evolutionary responses tested were consistently affected by dietary resource regimes.

In this study, we cloned and characterized the full-length cDNA of Sxl in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) (SpSxl). The deduced amino acid sequence of SpSxl contained two RNA-binding motifs (RRM), namely RRM1 and RRM2. The SpSxl mRNA levels were abundant in the androgenic glands of the male crab, implying its potential role in male sexual development. This hypothesis was supported by the RNAi experiment, revealing that the injection of SpSxl dsRNA in vivo caused an increase in the expression of SpIAG, which is a key gene of male sexual differentiation in crustaceans. The interference result of SpTra-2 suggested that SpSxl and SpTra-2 may be involved in sex-differentiation by direct or indirect regulation of SpIAG gene. The eye stalk ablation (ESA) experiments further confirmed that SpSxl could not regulate SpIAG through eyestalk neuropeptide, implying other regulation pathways. In addition, treatment with SpSxl dsRNA had no effects on SpDmrt expression, suggesting that sex determination in S. paramamosain is different from that in D. melanogaster.",2020,"Mengen Wang, Xi Xie, Dongjie Xu, Zhenya Wang, Guohong Yu, Zhongwen Jin, Dongfa Zhu, Mengen Wang, Xi Xie, Dongjie Xu, Zhenya Wang, Guohong Yu, Zhongwen Jin, Dongfa Zhu"
Conservation of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel protein within the Insecta,31206812,10.1111/imb.12605,"The voltage-sensitive sodium channel (VSSC) is essential for the generation and propagation of action potentials. VSSC kinetics can be modified by producing different splice variants. The functionality of VSSC depends on features such as the voltage sensors, the selectivity filter and the inactivation loop. Mutations in Vssc conferring resistance to pyrethroid insecticides are known as knockdown resistance (kdr). We analysed the conservation of VSSC in both a broad scope and a narrow scope by three approaches: (1) we compared conservation of sequences and of differential exon use across orders of the Insecta; (2) we determined which kdr mutations were possible with a single nucleotide mutation in nine populations of Aedes aegypti; and (3) we examined the individual VSSC variation that exists within a population of Drosophila melanogaster. There is an increasing amount of transcript diversity possible from Diplura towards Diptera. The residues of the voltage sensors, selectivity filter and inactivation loop are highly conserved. The majority of exon sequences were >88.6% similar. Strain-specific differences in codon constraints exist for kdr mutations in nine strains of A. aegypti. Three Vssc mutations were found in one population of D. melanogaster. This study shows that, overall, Vssc is highly conserved across Insecta and within a population of an insect, but that important differences do exist.",2020,"Juan J Silva, Jeffrey G Scott, Juan J Silva, Jeffrey G Scott"
Exposure to atrazine alters behaviour and disrupts the dopaminergic system in Drosophila melanogaster,28847529,10.1016/j.cbpc.2017.08.005,"Atrazine is an extensively used herbicide, and has become a common environmental contaminant. Effects on dopaminergic neurotransmission in mammals following exposure to atrazine have been previously demonstrated. Here, the effects of atrazine regarding behavioural and dopaminergic neurotransmission parameters were assessed in the fruit fly D. melanogaster, exposed during embryonic and larval development. Embryos (newly fertilized eggs) were exposed to two atrazine concentrations (10μM and 100μM) in the diet until the adult fly emerged. Negative geotaxis assay, as well as exploratory behaviour, immobility time and number of grooming episodes in an open field system were assessed. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity and gene expression of the dopaminergic system were also evaluated in newly emerged male and female flies. All analyzed parameters in male flies were not significantly affected by atrazine exposure. However female flies exposed to atrazine at 10μM presented an increase in immobility time and a reduction in exploratory activity in the open field test, which was offset by an increase in the number of grooming episodes. Also, female flies exposed to 100μM of atrazine presented an increase in immobility time. Gene expression of DOPA decarboxylase and dopamine (DA) receptors were also increased only in females. The behavioural effects of atrazine exposure observed in female flies were due to a disturbance in the dopaminergic system.",2017,"Fernanda Hernandes Figueira, Natália de Quadros Oliveira, Lais Mattos de Aguiar, Ana Laura Escarrone, Ednei Gilberto Primel, Daniela Martí Barros, Carlos Eduardo da Rosa, Fernanda Hernandes Figueira, Natália de Quadros Oliveira, Lais Mattos de Aguiar, Ana Laura Escarrone, Ednei Gilberto Primel, Daniela Martí Barros, Carlos Eduardo da Rosa"

Traditionally, animals were thought to have only one VGSC gene comprising a α-subunit with four homologous domains (DI-DIV). The present study showed that Rhopalosiphum padi, an economically important crop pest, owned a unique heterodimeric VGSC (H1 and H2 subunits) encoded by two genes (Rpvgsc1 and Rpvgsc2), which is unusual in insects and other animals. The open reading frame (ORF) of Rpvgsc1 consisted 1150 amino acids, and the ORF of Rpvgsc2 had 957 amino acids. Rpvgsc1 showed 64.1% amino acid identity to DI-DII of Drosophila melanogaster VGSC and Rpvgsc2 showed 64.0% amino acid identity to DIII-DIV of D. melanogaster VGSC. A M918L mutation previously reported in pyrethroids-resistant strains of other insects was found in the IIS4-S6 region of R. padi field sample. The two R. padi VGSC genes were expressed at all developmental stages and showed similar expression patterns after treatment with beta-cypermethrin. Knockdown of Rpvgsc1 or Rpvgsc2 caused significant reduction in mortality rate of R. padi after exposure to beta-cypermethrin.

Multiple sexual selection pressures drive the rapid evolution of complex morphology in a male secondary genital structure,26664690,10.1002/ece3.1721,"The genitalia of internally fertilizing taxa represent a striking example of rapid morphological evolution. Although sexual selection can shape variation in genital morphology, it has been difficult to test whether multiple sexual selection pressures combine to drive the rapid evolution of individual genital structures. Here, we test the hypothesis that both pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection can act in concert to shape complex structural variation in secondary genital morphology. We genetically modified the size and shape of the posterior lobes of Drosophila melanogaster males and tested the consequences of morphological variation on several reproductive measures. We found that the posterior lobes are necessary for genital coupling and that they are also the targets of multiple postcopulatory processes that shape quantitative variation in morphology, even though these structures make no direct contact with the external female genitalia or internal reproductive organs during mating. We also found that males with smaller and less structurally complex posterior lobes suffer substantial fitness costs in competitive fertilization experiments. Our results show that sexual selection mechanisms can combine to shape the morphology of a single genital structure and that the posterior lobes of D. melanogaster are the targets of multiple postcopulatory selection pressures.",2015,"Stephen R Frazee, John P Masly, Stephen R Frazee, John P Masly"
Protein competition switches the function of COP9 from self-renewal to differentiation,25119050,10.1038/nature13562,"The balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation is controlled by intrinsic factors and niche signals. In the Drosophila melanogaster ovary, some intrinsic factors promote germline stem cell (GSC) self-renewal, whereas others stimulate differentiation. However, it remains poorly understood how the balance between self-renewal and differentiation is controlled. Here we use D. melanogaster ovarian GSCs to demonstrate that the differentiation factor Bam controls the functional switch of the COP9 complex from self-renewal to differentiation via protein competition. The COP9 complex is composed of eight Csn subunits, Csn1-8, and removes Nedd8 modifications from target proteins. Genetic results indicated that the COP9 complex is required intrinsically for GSC self-renewal, whereas other Csn proteins, with the exception of Csn4, were also required for GSC progeny differentiation. Bam-mediated Csn4 sequestration from the COP9 complex via protein competition inactivated the self-renewing function of COP9 and allowed other Csn proteins to promote GSC differentiation. Therefore, this study reveals a protein-competition-based mechanism for controlling the balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Because numerous self-renewal factors are ubiquitously expressed throughout the stem cell lineage in various systems, protein competition may function as an important mechanism for controlling the self-renewal-to-differentiation switch.",2014,"Lei Pan, Su Wang, Tinglin Lu, Changjiang Weng, Xiaoqing Song, Joseph K Park, Jin Sun, Zhi-Hao Yang, Junjing Yu, Hong Tang, Dennis M McKearin, Daniel A Chamovitz, Jianquan Ni, Ting Xie, Lei Pan, Su Wang, Tinglin Lu, Changjiang Weng, Xiaoqing Song, Joseph K Park, Jin Sun, Zhi-Hao Yang, Junjing Yu, Hong Tang, Dennis M McKearin, Daniel A Chamovitz, Jianquan Ni, Ting Xie"
A staging scheme for the development of the moth midge Clogmia albipunctata,24409296,10.1371/journal.pone.0084422,"Model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, allow us to address a wide range of biological questions with experimental rigour. However, studies in model species need to be complemented by comparative studies if we are to fully understand the functional properties and evolutionary history of developmental processes. The establishment of new model organisms is crucial for this purpose. One of the first essential steps to establish a species as an experimental model is to carefully describe its life cycle and development. The resulting staging scheme serves as a framework for molecular studies, and allows us to homologise developmental processes between species. In this paper, we have characterised the life cycle and development of an emerging non-drosophilid dipteran model system: the moth midge Clogmia albipunctata. In particular, we focus on early embryogenesis (cleavage and blastoderm cycles before gastrulation), on formation and retraction of extraembryonic tissues, and on formation of the germ line. Considering the large evolutionary distance between the two species (approximately 250 million years), we find that the development of C. albipunctata is remarkably conserved compared to D. melanogaster. On the other hand, we detect significant differences in morphology and timing affecting the development of extraembryonic tissues and the germ line. Moreover, C. albipunctata shows several heterochronic shifts, and lacks head involution and associated processes during late stages of development.",2014,"Eva Jiménez-Guri, Karl R Wotton, Brenda Gavilán, Johannes Jaeger, Eva Jiménez-Guri, Karl R Wotton, Brenda Gavilán, Johannes Jaeger"
Patterns of evolutionary conservation of microsatellites (SSRs) suggest a faster rate of genome evolution in Hymenoptera than in Diptera,23292136,10.1093/gbe/evs133,"Microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are common and widespread DNA elements in genomes of many organisms. However, their dynamics in genome evolution is unclear, whereby they are thought to evolve neutrally. More available genome sequences along with dated phylogenies allowed for studying the evolution of these repetitive DNA elements along evolutionary time scales. This could be used to compare rates of genome evolution. We show that SSRs in insects can be retained for several hundred million years. Different types of microsatellites seem to be retained longer than others. By comparing Dipteran with Hymenopteran species, we found very similar patterns of SSR loss during their evolution, but both taxa differ profoundly in the rate. Relative to divergence time, Diptera lost SSRs twice as fast as Hymenoptera. The loss of SSRs on the Drosophila melanogaster X-chromosome was higher than on the other chromosomes. However, accounting for generation time, the Diptera show an 8.5-fold slower rate of SSR loss than the Hymenoptera, which, in contrast to previous studies, suggests a faster genome evolution in the latter. This shows that generation time differences can have a profound effect. A faster genome evolution in these insects could be facilitated by several factors very different to Diptera, which is discussed in light of our results on the haplodiploid D. melanogaster X-chromosome. Furthermore, large numbers of SSRs can be found to be in synteny and thus could be exploited as a tool to investigate genome structure and evolution.",2013,"Eckart Stolle, Jonathan H Kidner, Robin F A Moritz, Eckart Stolle, Jonathan H Kidner, Robin F A Moritz"
Drosophila melanogaster Selection for Survival of Bacillus cereus Infection: Life History Trait Indirect Responses,23094195,10.1155/2012/935970,"To study evolved resistance/tolerance in an insect model, we carried out an experimental evolution study using D. melanogaster and the opportunistic pathogen B. cereus as the agent of selection. The selected lines evolved a 3.0- to 3.3-log increase in the concentration of spores required for 50% mortality after 18-24 generations of selection. In the absence of any treatment, selected lines evolved an increase in egg production and delayed development time. The latter response could be interpreted as a cost of evolution. Alternatively, delayed development might have been a target of selection resulting in increased adult fat body function including production of antimicrobial peptides, and, incidentally, yolk production for oocytes and eggs. When treated with autoclaved spores, the egg production difference between selected and control lines was abolished, and this response was consistent with the hypothesis of a cost of an induced immune response. Treatment with autoclaved spores also reduced life span in some cases and elicited early-age mortality in the selected and wound-control lines both of which were consistent with the hypothesis of a cost associated with induction of immune responses. In general, assays on egg production yielded key outcomes including the negative effect of autoclaved spores on egg production.",2012,"Junjie Ma, Andrew K Benson, Stephen D Kachman, Zhen Hu, Lawrence G Harshman, Junjie Ma, Andrew K Benson, Stephen D Kachman, Zhen Hu, Lawrence G Harshman"
Protein phosphorylation changes reveal new candidates in the regulation of egg activation and early embryogenesis in D. melanogaster,22884528,10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.07.024,"Egg activation is the series of events that must occur for a mature oocyte to become capable of supporting embryogenesis. These events include changes to the egg's outer coverings, the resumption and completion of meiosis, the translation of new proteins, and the degradation of specific maternal mRNAs. While we know some of the molecules that direct the initial events of egg activation, it remains unclear how multiple pathways are coordinated to change the cellular state from mature oocyte to activated egg. Using a proteomic approach we have identified new candidates for the regulation and progression of egg activation. Reasoning that phosphorylation can simultaneously and rapidly modulate the activity of many proteins, we identified proteins that are post-translationally modified during the transition from oocyte to activated egg in Drosophila melanogaster. We find that at least 311 proteins change in phosphorylation state between mature oocytes and activated eggs. These proteins fall into various functional classes related to the events of egg activation including calcium binding, proteolysis, and protein translation. Our set of candidates includes genes already associated with egg activation, as well as many genes not previously studied during this developmental period. RNAi knockdown of a subset of these genes revealed a new gene, mrityu, necessary for embryonic development past the first mitosis. Thus, by identifying phospho-modulated proteins we have produced a focused candidate set for future genetic studies to test their roles in egg activation and the initiation of embryogenesis.",2012,"Amber R Krauchunas, Vanessa L Horner, Mariana F Wolfner, Amber R Krauchunas, Vanessa L Horner, Mariana F Wolfner"
Roles of young serine-endopeptidase genes in survival and reproduction revealed rapid evolution of phenotypic effects at adult stages,21946255,10.4161/fly.5.4.17808,"Our recent study found that 30% of young genes were essential for viability that determines development through stages from embryo to pupae in Drosophila melanogaster, revealing rapidly evolving genetic components involved in the evolution of development. Meanwhile, many young genes did not produce complete lethal phenotype upon constitutive knockdown, suggesting that they may not be essential for viability. These genes, nevertheless, were fixed by natural selection, and might play an important functional role in their adult stage. Here we present a detailed demonstration that a newly duplicated serine-type endopeptidase gene that originated in the common ancestor in the D. melanogaster subgroup 6~11 million years ago, named Slfc, revealing a strong effect in post-eclosion. Although animals survived constitutive knockdown of Slfc to adult stage, however, their life span reduced significantly by two-thirds compared to wildtype. Furthermore, the Slfc-RNAi males dropped their fertility to less than 10% of the wildtype level, with over 80% of these males being sterile. The Slfc-RNAi females, on the other hand, showed a slight reduction in fertility. This case study demonstrates that a young gene can contribute to fitness on the three important traits of life history in adults, including the life expectancy, male fertility and female fertility, suggesting that new genes can quickly evolve and impact multiple phenotypes.",2011,"Sidi Chen, Haiwang Yang, Benjamin H Krinsky, Anthony Zhang, Manyuan Long, Sidi Chen, Haiwang Yang, Benjamin H Krinsky, Anthony Zhang, Manyuan Long"

Mutation and altered expression of SWH pathway proteins has been observed in several types of human cancer, but the contribution of these events to tumorigenesis has been unclear. Here we show that YAP can enhance the transformed phenotype of ovarian cancer cell lines and that YAP confers resistance to chemotherapeutic agents that are commonly used to treat ovarian cancer. We find that high nuclear YAP expression correlates with poor patient prognosis in a cohort of 268 invasive epithelial ovarian cancer samples. Segregation by histotype shows that the correlation between nuclear YAP and poor survival is predominantly associated with clear cell tumors, independent of stage.

Two PABPC1-binding sites in GW182 proteins promote miRNA-mediated gene silencing,21063388,10.1038/emboj.2010.274,"miRNA-mediated gene silencing requires the GW182 proteins, which are characterized by an N-terminal domain that interacts with Argonaute proteins (AGOs), and a C-terminal silencing domain (SD). In Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) GW182 and a human (Hs) orthologue, TNRC6C, the SD was previously shown to interact with the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC1). Here, we show that two regions of GW182 proteins interact with PABPC1: the first contains a PABP-interacting motif 2 (PAM2; as shown before for TNRC6C) and the second contains the M2 and C-terminal sequences in the SD. The latter mediates indirect binding to the PABPC1 N-terminal domain. In D. melanogaster cells, the second binding site dominates; however, in HsTNRC6A-C the PAM2 motif is essential for binding to both Hs and DmPABPC1. Accordingly, a single amino acid substitution in the TNRC6A-C PAM2 motif abolishes the interaction with PABPC1. This mutation also impairs TNRC6s silencing activity. Our findings reveal that despite species-specific differences in the relative strength of the PABPC1-binding sites, the interaction between GW182 proteins and PABPC1 is critical for miRNA-mediated silencing in animal cells.",2010,"Eric Huntzinger, Joerg E Braun, Susanne Heimstädt, Latifa Zekri, Elisa Izaurralde, Eric Huntzinger, Joerg E Braun, Susanne Heimstädt, Latifa Zekri, Elisa Izaurralde"
Epigenomic communication systems in humans and honey bees: from molecules to behavior,20594964,10.1016/j.yhbeh.2010.05.016,"A 2010 Nature editorial entitled ""Time for the Epigenome"" trumpets the appearance of the International Human Epigenome Consortium and likens it to Biology's equivalent of the Large Hadron Collider. It strongly endorses the viewpoint that selective modifications of ""marks"" on DNA and histones constitute the crucial codes of life, a proposition which is hotly contested (Ptashne et al., in 2010). This proposition reflects the current mindset that DNA and histone modifications are the prime movers in gene regulation during evolution. This claim is perplexing, since the well characterized organisms, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, lack methylated DNA ""marks"" and the DNA methytransferase enzymology. Despite their complete absence, D. melanogaster nevertheless has extensive gene regulatory networks which drive sophisticated development, gastrulation, migration of germ cells and yield a nervous system with significant neural attributes. In stark contrast, the honey bee Apis mellifera deploys its human-type DNA methyltransferase enzymology to ""mark"" its DNA and it too has sophisticated development. What roles therefore is DNA methylation playing in different animals? The honey bee brings a fresh perspective to this question. Its combinatorial chemistry of pheromones, tergal and cuticular exudates provide an exquisite communication system between thousands of individuals. The development of queen and worker is strictly controlled by differential feeding of royal jelly and their adult behaviors are accompanied by epigenomic changes.

Dual-functioning transcription factors in the developmental gene network of Drosophila melanogaster,20594356,10.1186/1471-2105-11-366,"Background:
      
    

    
      Quantitative models for transcriptional regulation have shown great promise for advancing our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying gene regulation. However, all of the models to date assume a transcription factor (TF) to have either activating or repressing function towards all the genes it is regulating.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In this paper we demonstrate, on the example of the developmental gene network in D. melanogaster, that the data-fit can be improved by up to 40% if the model is allowing certain TFs to have dual function, that is, acting as activator for some genes and as repressor for others. We demonstrate that the improvement is not due to additional flexibility in the model but rather derived from the data itself. We also found no evidence for the involvement of other known site-specific TFs in regulating this network. Finally, we propose SUMOylation as a candidate biological mechanism allowing TFs to switch their role when a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is covalently attached to the TF. We strengthen this hypothesis by demonstrating that the TFs predicted to have dual function also contain the known SUMO consensus motif, while TFs predicted to have only one role lack this motif.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:

Here, we show that feeding flies with SILAC-labeled yeast leads to almost complete labeling in the first filial generation. We used these ""SILAC flies"" to investigate sexual dimorphism of protein abundance in D. melanogaster. Quantitative proteome comparison of adult male and female flies revealed distinct biological processes specific for each sex. Using a tudor mutant that is defective for germ cell generation allowed us to differentiate between sex-specific protein expression in the germ line and somatic tissue. We identified many proteins with known sex-specific expression bias. In addition, several new proteins with a potential role in sexual dimorphism were identified.

This study reports an initial survey of the molecular organization of the pericentric heterochromatin in nonmodel species from the A. maculipennis subgroup. Molecular identity and chromosomal localization were established for short DNA fragments obtained by microdissection from the pericentric diffuse beta-heterochromatin of A. atroparvus. Among 102 sequenced clones of the Atr2R library, twenty had sequence similarity to transposable elements (TEs) from the Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti genomes. At least six protein-coding single-copy genes from A. gambiae and four single-copy genes from Drosophila melanogaster were homologous to eight clones from the library. Most of these conserved genes were heterochromatic in A. gambiae but euchromatic in D. melanogaster. The remaining 74 clones were characterized as noncoding repetitive DNA.

Variation in mitochondrial genotype has substantial lifespan effects which may be modulated by nuclear background,18727704,10.1111/j.1474-9726.2008.00428.x,"Mitochondria are thought to play a central role in aging. In humans, specific naturally occurring mitochondrial genetic variants are overrepresented among centenarians, but only in certain populations; therefore, we cannot tell whether this effect is due solely to mitochondrial genetics or to nuclear-mitochondrial gene complexes, nor do we know the magnitude of the effect in terms we can relate to, such as mean lifespan differences. To examine the effects of natural mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation on lifespan, we need to vary the mitochondrial genotype while controlling the nuclear genotype. Here, nuclear genome replacement is achieved using strains of Drosophila melanogaster bearing multiply inverted 'balancer' chromosomes that suppress recombination, and an isogenic donor strain, thus forcing replacement of entire chromosomes in a single cross while suppressing recombination. Lifespans of wild-type mtDNA variants on the chromosome replacement background vary substantially, and sequencing of the entire protein coding mitochondrial genomes indicates that these lifespan differences are sometimes associated with single amino acid differences. On other nuclear genetic backgrounds, the magnitude and direction of these lifespan effects can change dramatically, and this can be due to changes in baseline mortality risk, rate of aging and/or time of onset of aging. The limited mtDNA variation in D. melanogaster makes it an ideal organism for biochemical studies to link genotype and aging phenotype.",2008,"David J Clancy, David J Clancy"
A functioning ovary is not required for sex peptide to reduce receptivity to mating in D. melanogaster,17303161,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2006.12.008,"In many species of invertebrates that mate multiply, mating induces a temporary reduction in sexual receptivity and an increase in the rate of egg laying. These processes often appear to be co-ordinately regulated, and triggered by the passage of seminal fluid components. However, little is known about the mechanisms of the links between these processes. In Drosophila melanogaster females, post-mating sexual receptivity is decreased and egg laying increased by the actions of the male ejaculate-derived sex peptide (SP). Effects of SP on egg laying and receptivity have not been observed separately, which has led to the suggestion that the reduction in receptivity is at least partially dependent on the status of egg development or egg laying, with the presence of an egg in the uterus being a strong predictor of receptivity state. Here, we examine the response to SP of females in which egg development is arrested at an early, pre-vitellogenic stage. We find that females in which egg development is arrested mate normally and that normal receptivity responses to SP are independent of early egg arrest. Among fertile control females that laid eggs, a significant effect of SP on receptivity was also observed, independent of whether an egg was present in the uterus. The results show that the effects of SP on receptivity are not dependent upon a fully functional ovary, and hence that egg development or laying is not causal in the SP receptivity response.",2007,"Andrew I Barnes, James M Boone, Linda Partridge, Tracey Chapman, Andrew I Barnes, James M Boone, Linda Partridge, Tracey Chapman"
Evolution of insect metamorphosis: a microarray-based study of larval and adult gene expression in the ant Camponotus festinatus,15926695,,"Holometabolous insects inhabit almost every terrestrial ecosystem. The evolutionary success of holometabolous insects stems partly from their developmental program, which includes discrete larval and adult stages. To gain an understanding of how development differs among holometabolous insect taxa, we used cDNA microarray technology to examine differences in gene expression between larval and adult Camponotus festinatus ants. We then compared expression patterns obtained from our study to those observed in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. We found that many genes showed distinct patterns of expression between the larval and adult ant life stages, a result that was confirmed through quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Genes involved in protein metabolism and possessing structural activity tended to be more highly expressed in larval than adult ants. In contrast, genes relatively upregulated in adults possessed a greater diversity of functions and activities. We also discovered that patterns of expression observed for homologous genes in D. melanogaster differed substantially from those observed in C. festinatus. Our results suggest that the specific molecular mechanisms involved in metamorphosis will differ substantially between insect taxa. Systematic investigation of gene expression during development of other taxa will provide additional information on how developmental pathways evolve.",2005,"Michael A D Goodisman, Jun Isoe, Diana E Wheeler, Michael A Wells, Michael A D Goodisman, Jun Isoe, Diana E Wheeler, Michael A Wells"
Synthesis and biological activities of turkesterone 11alpha-acyl derivatives,15841223,10.1093/jis/3.1.6,"Turkesterone is a phytoecdysteroid possessing an 11alpha-hydroxyl group. It is an analogue of the insect steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone. Previous ecdysteroid QSAR and molecular modelling studies predicted that the cavity of the ligand binding domain of the ecdysteroid receptor would possess space in the vicinity of C-11/C-12 of the ecdysteroid. We report the regioselective synthesis of a series of turkesterone 11alpha-acyl derivatives in order to explore this possibility. The structures of the analogues have been unambiguously determined by spectroscopic means (NMR and low-resolution mass spectrometry). Purity was verified by HPLC. Biological activities have been determined in Drosophila melanogaster B(II) cell-based bioassay for ecdysteroid agonists and in an in vitro radioligand-displacement assay using bacterially-expressed D. melanogaster EcR/USP receptor proteins. The 11alpha-acyl derivatives do retain a significant amount of biological activity relative to the parent ecdysteroid. Further, although activity initially drops with the extension of the acyl chain length (C2 to C4), it then increases (C6 to C10), before decreasing again (C14 and C20). The implications of these findings for the interaction of ecdysteroids with the ecdysteroid receptor and potential applications in the generation of affinity-labelled and fluorescently-tagged ecdysteroids are discussed.",2003,"Laurence Dinan, Pauline Bourne, Pensri Whiting, Ada Tsitsekli, Ziyadilla Saatov, Tarlochan S Dhadialla, Robert E Hormann, René Lafont, Josep Coll, Laurence Dinan, Pauline Bourne, Pensri Whiting, Ada Tsitsekli, Ziyadilla Saatov, Tarlochan S Dhadialla, Robert E Hormann, René Lafont, Josep Coll"
Pseudomonas aeruginosa relA contributes to virulence in Drosophila melanogaster,15385461,10.1128/IAI.72.10.5638-5645.2004,"The stringent response is a mechanism by which bacteria adapt to nutritional deficiencies through the production of the guanine nucleotides ppGpp and pppGpp, produced by the RelA enzyme. We investigated the role of the relA gene in the ability of an extracellular pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to cause infection. Strains lacking the relA gene were created from the prototypical laboratory strain PAO1 as well as the mucoid cystic fibrosis isolate 6106, which lacks functional quorum-sensing systems. The absence of relA abolished the production of ppGpp and pppGpp under conditions of amino acid starvation. We found that strains lacking relA exhibited reduced virulence in a D. melanogaster feeding assay. In conditions of low magnesium, the relA gene enhanced production of the cell-cell signal N-[3-oxododecanoyl]-l-homoserine lactone, whereas relA reduced the production of the 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone signal during serine hydroxamate induction of the stringent response. In the relA mutant, alterations in the Pseudomonas quinolone system pathways seemed to increase the production of pyocyanin and decrease the production of elastase. Deletion of relA also resulted in reduced levels of the RpoS sigma factor. These results suggest that adjustment of cellular ppGpp and pppGpp levels could be an important regulatory mechanism in P. aeruginosa adaptation in pathogenic relationships.",2004,"David L Erickson, J Louise Lines, Everett C Pesci, Vittorio Venturi, Douglas G Storey, David L Erickson, J Louise Lines, Everett C Pesci, Vittorio Venturi, Douglas G Storey"
Quantitative analysis of phenol oxidase activity in insect hemolymph,11962604,10.2144/02324st08,"We describe a simple, inexpensive, and robust protocol for the quantification of phenol oxidase activity in insect hemolymph. Discrete volumes of hemolymph from Drosophila melanogaster larvae are applied to pieces of filter paper soaked in an L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) solution. Phenol oxidase present in the samples catalyzes melanin synthesis from the L-DOPA precursor, resulting in the appearance of a roughly circular melanized spot on the filter paper. The filter paper is then scanned and analyzed with image-processing software. Each pixel in an image is assigned a grayscale value. The mean of the grayscale values for a circular region of pixels at the center of the image of each spot is used to compute a melanization index (MI) value, the computation is based on a comparison to an external standard (India ink). Numerical MI values for control and experimental larvae can then be pooled and subjected to statistical analysis. This protocol was used to evaluate phenol oxidase activity in larvae of different backgrounds: wild-type, lozenge, hopscotch(Tumorous-lethal) (which induces the formation of large melanotic tumors), and body-color mutations ebony and yellow. Our results demonstrate that this assay is sensitive enough for use in genetic screens with D. melanogaster and could conceivably be used for evaluation of MI from hemolymph of other insects.",2002,"Richard Paul Sorrentino, Chiyedza N Small, Shubha Govind, Richard Paul Sorrentino, Chiyedza N Small, Shubha Govind"

A semi-quantitative reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction method revealed that UBASH3A gene expression is limited to only a few tissues, with its highest expression in spleen, peripheral blood leukocytes, and bone marrow. The putative 661-amino-acid protein shows considerable homology to a hypothetical protein from Drosophila melanogaster but only domain homologies to other organisms. Both the human and D. melanogaster proteins contain protein-protein interaction domains, viz., SH3 and ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains, in addition to a novel domain also containing a nuclear localization signal. This is the first protein described containing both UBA and SH3 domains. The gene, thus called UBASH3A, spans 40 kb and is divided into 15 exons.

Biological effects of canatoxin in different insect models: evidence for a proteolytic activation of the toxin by insect cathepsinlike enzymes,9145031,10.1093/jee/90.2.340,"Canatoxin is a toxic protein isolated from the jackbean, Canavalia ensiformis. The toxin injected intraperitoneally is lethal for mice and rats; however, it is inactive if given orally. In this study, Manduca sexta (L.)

(Diptera), Rhodnius prolixus (Stål) (Hemiptera), and Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) (Coleoptera) were fed on canatoxin-containing diets. No effects were seen in M. sexta, S. americana, D. melanogaster, or A. aegypti. No traces of canatoxin were found in their feces, suggesting that the protein was digested completely by these insects, which characteristically have a trypsin-based digestion. In contrast, canatoxin was lethal for insects displaying cathepsin-based digestion. Thus, for C. maculatus, a diet containing 0.25% wt:wt canatoxin caused complete inhibition of larval growth. When R. prolixus were fed on canatoxin, 2 effects were seen: impairment of water excretion and increased lethality 48-96 h after feeding. The lethal effect of canatoxin in R. prolixus was blocked partially or completely when the digestion of the toxin by R. prolixus midgut enzymes was impaired. The data showed that canatoxin is highly toxic when ingested by some species of insects but not affecting others, probably in correlation with the characteristics of the digestive process of the insect.",1997,"C R Carlini, A E Oliveira, P Azambuja, J Xavier-Filho, M A Wells, C R Carlini, A E Oliveira, P Azambuja, J Xavier-Filho, M A Wells"
Causes and consequences of esterase 6 enzyme activity variation in pre-adult Drosophila melanogaster,7915261,10.1038/hdy.1994.115,"We report heritable threefold differences in both larval and pupal esterase 6 activity among 17 isoallelic lines of D. melanogaster extracted from a natural population. The activity differences in the two stages are only weakly correlated with each other or with previously determined values for esterase 6 activity in adults of these lines. The pre-adult activity variation is also unrelated to polymorphisms among the lines for six esterase 6 allozymes and six restriction sites in a region encompassing the esterase 6 coding DNA and the first kbp of 5' flanking DNA. However, two insertions, of 8.0 and 6.8 kbp, located about 1.4 kbp 5' of the esterase 6 coding region are associated with low activity in larvae and, to a lesser extent, in pupae, albeit not in adults. Restriction mapping reveals similarity between the 8.0 kbp insert and the 7.4 kbp retrotransposon 17.6. The differences in larval activity among lines are positively correlated with fitness as assessed from assays of pre-adult viability and development time but no significant associations between pupal esterase 6 activity and these measures are detected. Some effects of esterase 6 allozyme differences are also found for viability and development time but these effects could be explained by linkage disequilibrium between the 8.0 kbp insert and the EST6-9 allozyme.",1994,"J G Oakeshott, M Saad, A Y Game, M J Healy, J G Oakeshott, M Saad, A Y Game, M J Healy"
Evolution of delayed reproductive senescence in male fruit flies: sperm competition,8125263,10.1007/BF01435992,"Populations of Drosophila melanogaster that had been subjected to long-term selection favoring either delayed or rapid senescence were compared with respect to age-specific components of male reproductive success involving sperm competition. These components of reproductive success were divided into those related to sperm 'defense' (protection of sperm from other males), and into those related to sperm 'offense' (ability to mate with previously mated females and to displace the sperm of other males). Males were tested at four ages ranging from 1-2 d to 5-6 wk after eclosion. Several aspects of sperm defense capability showed clear evidence of senescent decline. Furthermore, males from populations selected for delayed senescence were superior to males from control (rapid senescence) populations with regard to components of sperm defense. The superiority of males from populations with delayed senescence either increased as a function of male age, or was present at all ages tested. These results indicate that the rate of reproductive senescence in male D. melanogaster can be altered in predictable directions by artificial selection. There were no differences between selection regimes with regard to sperm offense, and most components of sperm offense did not show clear evidence of senescence. The improved late-age reproductive success of males from populations selected for delayed senescence did not appear to entail any cost or trade-off at early ages with respect to the reproductive traits examined in these experiments.",1993,"P M Service, A J Fales, P M Service, A J Fales"
vestigial suppressor genes and resistance to aminopterin in Drosophila melanogaster,1428957,10.1038/hdy.1992.152,"We have shown that the vestigial (vg) mutant of D. melanogaster has a perturbed nucleotide metabolism compared to various wild-type strains. The mutant is particularly spontaneously resistant to aminopterin. The resistance seems to correlate with an increase in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) activity and quantity. The DHRF is a target enzyme of aminopterin. Our results suggest that the vg+ gene could be a regulatory gene acting on the DHFR gene. The wing mutant phenotype being due to a decrease in the thymidylate pool (dTMP) (Silber et al., 1989). In order to understand better the action of the mutant gene on nucleotide metabolism, we have induced suppressor genes of the mutant phenotype by mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and bromouridine (BUR). The suppressor strains obtained display a phenotype intermediate between wild-type and vg phenotype. The action of three independent suppressor genes on eight parameters of nucleotide metabolism is reported here [three enzyme activities, resistance to aminopterin and to fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR), auxotrophy test and the ability to use exogenous thymidine and uridine]. In comparison to the original vg strain, major changes for the parameters tested are observed. The most striking effects are obtained with the vgBUR27 strain, which is highly sensitive to aminopterin and to fluorodeoxyuridine and didplas the highest thymidine kinase (TK) and DHFR activities within the strains tested.

Towards a physical map of the Drosophila melanogaster genome: mapping of cosmid clones within defined genomic divisions,2123026,10.1093/nar/18.21.6261,"A physical map of the D. melanogaster genome is being constructed, in the form of overlapping cosmid clones that are assigned to specific polytene chromosome sites. A master library of ca. 20,000 cosmids is screened with probes that correspond to numbered chromosomal divisions (ca. 1% of the genome); these probes are prepared by microdissection and PCR-amplification of individual chromosomes. The 120 to 250 cosmids selected by each probe are fingerprinted by Hinfl digestion and gel electrophoresis, and overlaps are detected by computer analysis of the fingerprints, permitting us to assemble sets of contiguous clones (contigs). Selected cosmids, both from contigs and unattached, are then localized by in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes. Crosshybridization analysis using end probes links some contigs, and hybridization to previously cloned genes relates the physical to the genetic map. This approach has been used to construct a physical map of the 3.8 megabase DNA in the three distal divisions of the x chromosome. The map is represented by 181 canonical cosmids, of which 108 clones in contigs and 32 unattached clones have been mapped individually by in situ hybridization to chromosomes.

Their isolation was accomplished by differential screening of the library using as probes 32P-labeled poly(A)+ mRNAs obtained from hand-staged medfly choriogenic versus prechoriogenic follicles. RNA blot hybridization analysis revealed that the genes corresponding to these clones have unique temporal profiles of mRNA accumulation, restricted to specific choriogenic stages. In addition, in vitro translation products encoded by these cDNAs approximately comigrated with polypeptides synthesized de novo in culture by choriogenic follicles. All three genes are located in regions of the medfly genome that are specifically amplified in female ovaries. DNA sequence analysis has revealed that one of these clones is derived from a homolog of the Drosophila melanogaster s38 chorion gene. It appears that, although D. melanogaster and C. capitata are separated by at least 120 million years of evolution, the mechanisms by which chorion genes are expressed and regulated during development have been well maintained. We suggest that the regulatory elements controlling the expression of sex-specific (e.g., chorion) genes may be isolated and used to construct transgenic medfly strains from which females could be eliminated by negative selection; such strains could be used as part of an effort to control this agricultural pest.",1990,"P P Tolias, M Konsolaki, K Komitopoulou, F C Kafatos, P P Tolias, M Konsolaki, K Komitopoulou, F C Kafatos"
[Gradient condensation of chromatin in ribosomal genes of Drosophila melanogaster],3131662,,"The organization of chromatin in D. melanogaster ribosomal repeats with and without insertions was studied. We have shown earlier that upon digestion with micrococcal nuclease a ""non-transcribed"" intergenic spacer produces unusual chromatin particles containing DNA fragments 200-280 b.p. in length. These particles sediment like H1-containing nucleosomes, are stable only in the presence of polyamines, and are probably bound to some non-histone protein. The content of core histones and H1 in different regions of ribosomal genes has been studied by two-dimensional electrophoresis of chromatin particles and by ""protein-image"" hybridization. The content of histones and respectively the degree of chromatin condensation increase in the following order: the 1kb-long region surrounding the initiation site is practically free of histones less than the region of 240 b.p. repeats from the intergenic spacer, containing homologies with the ribosomal promotor less than coding region preceding the usual site of insertions less than coding region lying behind this site less than inactive type II ribosomal insertion. Therefore, the region of the beginning of transcription of most ribosomal genes is in an active conformation, even though at least 75% of the genes are repressed. Ribosomal insertions are in a compact, repressed form. We suggest that their inhibitory action on the transcription of corresponding genes at the molecular level is similar to the position effect of heterochromatic regions at the chromosomal level.",1988,"A R Dzherbash'ian, R P Vashakidze, V L Karpov, A M Kolchinskiĭ, A D Mirzabekov, A R Dzherbash'ian, R P Vashakidze, V L Karpov, A M Kolchinskiĭ, A D Mirzabekov"
Selection affecting enzyme polymorphisms in laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster,28309890,10.1007/BF00344960,"Gene frequencies at nine polymorphic enzyme loci were followed in 22 cage populations of D. melanogaster all founded from the same stock but subsequently maintained in different environments. The three factors distinguishing the different environments were temperature and the alcohol and yeast in the medium and for each factor each population experienced either a constant or variable condition. The variable conditions were either coarse-grained (period between changes longer than the generation time) or fine-grained (the period less than the generation time).Six polymorphisms were found to be unaffected by any experimental condition. However, the various constant temperatures tested differed in their effects on Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh), Amylase (Amy) and Isocitrate dehydrogenase (Idh-NADP) gene frequencies. Furthermore, coarse-grained variation between high and low temperatures increased Amy and Idh-NADP heterozygosity and decreased Amy heterozygosity while fine-grained variation between such temperatures promoted Amy heterozygosity. In addition, joint coarse-grained variation for the type of alcohol and yeast promoted Amy and Idh-NADP heterozygosity as well as heterozygosity averaged over all nine loci.In general, the results suggested two major modifications to the hypothesis of a positive relationship between environmental and genetic variability. First, they indicated that the relationship is not always positive. It varies both between loci and between environments. Second however, they indicated that the relationship is more likely to be positive when the environmental variability is coarse- rather than fine-grained.",1979,"J G Oakeshott, J G Oakeshott"
The effects of heterozygosity changes on viability in Drosophila melanogaster,4624608,,"The viability effects of chromosomes from an old and from a new laboratory strain of D. melanogaster were studied in eight factorial combinations and at two heterozygosity levels. The combinations were so constructed that heterozygosity level could be varied in the third chromosomes of the carriers of a homozygous lethal marker, in the third chromosomes of their wild-type segregants, and in the genetic backgrounds of both. Excluding the effect of the marker and the exceptional outcomes of two of the combinations, and taking into account both large and small deviations from theoretical expectation, the following summary is given as the simplest consistent explanation of the results: 1) If total heterozygosities of two segregant types tend toward equality their viabilities tend toward equality also, whether background heterozygosity is high or low; if background heterozygosities is higher the tendency toward equality is slightly greater. 2) If total heterozygosity of two segregant types are unequal the less heterozygous type has the lower viability; the difference is more pronounced when background heterozygosity is low, less when it is high. 3) Differences between segregant viabilities are correlated with differences between the total heterozygosities of the two segregants; genetic background is effective to the extent, and only to the extent, that it contributes to the magnitude of this difference. This in turn appears to underlie, at least partly, the expression of a pronounced interchromosomal epistasis. Thus in this study viability is seen to depend upon both the quantity and distribution of heterozygosity, not only among the chromosomes of an individual but among the individuals of a given combination as well.",1972,"R Moree, R Moree"
Ancestral hymenopteran queen pheromones do not share the broad phylogenetic repressive effects of honeybee queen mandibular pheromone,31669583,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2019.103968,"Queen pheromones effect the reproductive division of labour, a defining feature of eusociality. Reproductive division of labour ensures that one, or a small number of, females are responsible for the majority of reproduction within a colony. Much work on the evolution and function of these pheromones has focussed on Queen Mandibular Pheromone (QMP) which is produced by the Western or European honeybee (Apis mellifera). QMP has phylogenetically broad effects, repressing reproduction in a variety of arthropods, including those distantly related to the honeybee such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. QMP is highly derived and has little chemical similarity to the majority of hymenopteran queen pheromones which are derived from cuticular hydrocarbons. This raises the question of whether the phylogenetically widespread repression of reproduction by QMP also occurs with more basal saturated hydrocarbon-based queen-pheromones. Using D. melanogaster we show that saturated hydrocarbons are incapable of repressing reproduction, unlike QMP. We also show no interaction between the four saturated hydrocarbons tested or between the saturated hydrocarbons and QMP, implying that there is no conservation in the mechanism of detection or action between these compounds. We propose that the phylogenetically broad reproductive repression seen in response to QMP is not a feature of all queen pheromones, but unique to QMP itself, which has implications for our understanding of how queen pheromones act and evolve.",2019,"Mackenzie R Lovegrove, Peter K Dearden, Elizabeth J Duncan, Mackenzie R Lovegrove, Peter K Dearden, Elizabeth J Duncan"

These structures arise from imaginal discs that show regenerative capacity when damaged. During imaginal disc regeneration, development has been shown to be delayed in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, but how conserved the delay-inducing mechanisms are across holometabolous insects has not been assessed. The goal of this research was to develop the hornworm Manduca sexta as an alternative model organism to study such damage-induced mechanisms, with the advantage of a larger hemolymph volume enabling access to the hormonal responses to imaginal disc damage. Upon whole-body X-ray exposure, we noted that the imaginal discs were selectively damaged, as assessed by TUNEL and Acridine Orange stains. Moreover, development was delayed, predominantly at the pupal-to-adult transition, with a concomitant delay in the prepupal ecdysteroid peak. The delays to eclosion were dose dependent, with some ability for repair of damaged tissues. We noted a shift in critical weight, as assessed by the point at which starvation no longer impacted developmental timing, without a change in growth rate, which was uncoupled from juvenile hormone clearance in the body.

In addition, a systems biology approach was used to search for known and predicted interaction networks between ZnO and proteins. The results observed in this study after in vivo exposure indicate that ZnO NPs are genotoxic and that homologous recombination (HR) was the main mechanism inducing loss of heterozygosis in the somatic cells of D. melanogaster. The results of in silico analysis indicated that ZnO is associated with the nuclear factor-kappa-beta (NFKB) protein family. In accordance with this model, ZnO exposure decreases the levels of NFKB inhibitory protein in the cell, consequently increasing NFKB dimers in the nucleus and inducing DNA double strand breaks (DSB) repair via HR.

Differences in gene regulation in a tephritid model of prezygotic reproductive isolation,30955213,10.1111/imb.12583,"The two tephritid fruit fly pests, Bactrocera tryoni and Bactrocera neohumeralis, are unusually well suited to the study of the genetics of reproductive isolating mechanisms. Sequence difference between the species is no greater than between a pair of conspecific Drosophila melanogaster populations. The two species exist in close sympatry, yet do not hybridize in the field, apparently kept separate by a strong premating isolation mechanism involving the time of day at which mating occurs. This spurred us to search for key genes for which time of day expression is regulated differently between the species. Using replicated, quantitative transcriptomes from head tissues of males of the two species, sampled in the day and night, we identified 141 transcripts whose abundance showed a significant interaction between species and time of day, indicating a difference in gene regulation. The brain transcripts showing this interaction were enriched for genes with a neurone function and 90% of these were more abundant at night than day in B. tryoni. Features of the expression patterns suggest that there may be a difference in the regulation of sleep-wake cycles between the species.

"Drosophila melanogaster cloak their eggs with pheromones, which prevents cannibalism",30629594,10.1371/journal.pbio.2006012,"Oviparous animals across many taxa have evolved diverse strategies that deter egg predation, providing valuable tests of how natural selection mitigates direct fitness loss. Communal egg laying in nonsocial species minimizes egg predation. However, in cannibalistic species, this very behavior facilitates egg predation by conspecifics (cannibalism). Similarly, toxins and aposematic signaling that deter egg predators are often inefficient against resistant conspecifics. Egg cannibalism can be adaptive, wherein cannibals may benefit through reduced competition and added nutrition, but since it reduces Darwinian fitness, the evolution of anticannibalistic strategies is rife. However, such strategies are likely to be nontoxic because deploying toxins against related individuals would reduce inclusive fitness. Here, we report how D. melanogaster use specific hydrocarbons to chemically mask their eggs from cannibal larvae. Using an integrative approach combining behavioral, sensory, and mass spectrometry methods, we demonstrate that maternally provisioned pheromone 7,11-heptacosadiene (7,11-HD) in the eggshell's wax layer deters egg cannibalism. Furthermore, we show that 7,11-HD is nontoxic, can mask underlying substrates (for example, yeast) when coated upon them, and its detection requires pickpocket 23 (ppk23) gene function. Finally, using light and electron microscopy, we demonstrate how maternal pheromones leak-proof the egg, consequently concealing it from conspecific larvae. Our data suggest that semiochemicals possibly subserve in deceptive functions across taxa, especially when predators rely on chemical cues to forage, and stimulate further research on deceptive strategies mediated through nonvisual sensory modules. This study thus highlights how integrative approaches can illuminate our understanding on the adaptive significance of deceptive defenses and the mechanisms through which they operate.",2019,"Sunitha Narasimha, Konstantin O Nagornov, Laure Menin, Antonio Mucciolo, Astrid Rohwedder, Bruno M Humbel, Martin Stevens, Andreas S Thum, Yury O Tsybin, Roshan K Vijendravarma, Sunitha Narasimha, Konstantin O Nagornov, Laure Menin, Antonio Mucciolo, Astrid Rohwedder, Bruno M Humbel, Martin Stevens, Andreas S Thum, Yury O Tsybin, Roshan K Vijendravarma"

The structural and functional analyses of 16 selected insects from different orders were performed with ProtParam, Compute PI, SOPMA, SignalP 4.1, TMHMM 2.0, ProtScale and ProDom tools in the ExPASy database and DNASTAR 12.1 software. The tertiary structure of Drosophila melanogaster as a sample of insects was predicted by the Phyre2 and TM-score servers and their similarities were verified by SuperPose servers. The tertiary structures were predicted using the 'd1ppjc2' model (PDB accession code: 1ppj C). A phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA 6.06 software using the neighbour-joining method. According to the results, there is a high identity of cytb in different insects so that they should be derived from a common ancestor. In protein-protein interaction analysis with STRING 10.0, twenty-three enriched pathways of KEGG were identified in D. melanogaster and other species. The obtained data provided a background for bioinformatic studies of the function and evolution of other insects and organisms.",2018,"Samin Seddigh, Maryam Darabi, Samin Seddigh, Maryam Darabi"
Characterization of Nora Virus Structural Proteins via Western Blot Analysis,27298753,10.1155/2016/9067848,"Nora virus is a single stranded RNA picorna-like virus with four open reading frames (ORFs). The coding potentials of the ORFs are not fully characterized, but ORF3 and ORF4 are believed to encode the capsid proteins (VP3, VP4a, VP4b, and VP4c) comprising the virion. To determine the polypeptide composition of Nora virus virions, polypeptides from purified virus were compared to polypeptides detected in Nora virus infected Drosophila melanogaster. Nora virus was purified from infected flies and used to challenge mice for the production of antisera. ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, and ORF4c were individually cloned and expressed in E. coli; resultant recombinant proteins purified and were used to make monospecific antisera. Antisera were evaluated via Western blot against whole virus particles and Nora virus infected fly lysates. Viral purification yielded two particle types with densities of ~1.31 g/mL (empty particles) and ~1.33 g/mL (complete virions). Comparison of purified virus polypeptide composition to Nora virus infected D. melanogaster lysate showed the number of proteins in infected cell lysates is less than purified virus. Our results suggest the virion is composed of 6 polypeptides, VP3, VP4a, two forms of VP4b, and two forms of VP4c. This polypeptide composition is similar to other small RNA insect viruses.",2016,"Brad L Ericson, Darby J Carlson, Kimberly A Carlson, Brad L Ericson, Darby J Carlson, Kimberly A Carlson"
Role of ocular albinism type 1 (OA1) GPCR in Asian gypsy moth development and transcriptional expression of heat-shock protein genes,26778432,10.1016/j.pestbp.2015.07.004,"The ocular albinism type 1 gene, named OA1, is a coding pigment cell-specific G protein-coupled receptor exclusively localized in intracellular organelles. However, the function of OA1 in insects remains generally unknown. In the present study, we explore for the first time the function of LdOA1 in the Asian gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar. To identify the function of LdOA1 gene in the development and growth of the Asian gypsy moth, the LdOA1 gene in third instar larvae was knocked down by RNAi. Compared with the controls, the knockdown of LdOA1 increased larval mortality but did not significantly affect their utilization of nutrition. Moreover, LdOA1 was stably transformed into the third chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster. The LdOA1 gene in the transformed D. melanogaster modulated the expression of heat-shock protein (hsp) and increased the expression of hsp genes under deltamethrin stress, which indicates that LdOA1 is involved in the regulation of hsp gene expression. These results deepen our understanding of the molecular function of OA1 in insects.",2016,"LiLi Sun, ZhiYing Wang, HongQu Wu, Peng Liu, ChuanShan Zou, XuTing Xue, ChuanWang Cao, LiLi Sun, ZhiYing Wang, HongQu Wu, Peng Liu, ChuanShan Zou, XuTing Xue, ChuanWang Cao"
Exploring the immune signalling pathway-related genes of the cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus: From molecular characterization to transcriptional profile upon microbial challenge,26724380,10.1016/j.dci.2015.12.018,"In dipteran insects, invading pathogens are selectively recognized by four major pathways, namely Toll, IMD, JNK, and JAK/STAT, and trigger the activation of several immune effectors. Although substantial advances have been made in understanding the immunity of model insects such as Drosophila melanogaster, knowledge on the activation of immune responses in other arthropods such as ticks remains limited. Herein, we have deepened our understanding of the intracellular signalling pathways likely to be involved in tick immunity by combining a large-scale in silico approach with high-throughput gene expression analysis. Data from in silico analysis revealed that although both the Toll and JAK/STAT signalling pathways are evolutionarily conserved across arthropods, ticks lack central components of the D. melanogaster IMD pathway. Moreover, we show that tick immune signalling-associated genes are constitutively transcribed in BME26 cells (a cell lineage derived from embryos of the cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus) and exhibit different transcriptional patterns in response to microbial challenge. Interestingly, Anaplasma marginale, a pathogen that is naturally transmitted by R. microplus, causes downregulation of immune-related genes, suggesting that this pathogen may manipulate the tick immune system, favouring its survival and vector colonization.",2016,"Rafael D Rosa, Janaína Capelli-Peixoto, Rafael D Mesquita, Sandra P Kalil, Paula C Pohl, Glória R Braz, Andrea C Fogaça, Sirlei Daffre, Rafael D Rosa, Janaína Capelli-Peixoto, Rafael D Mesquita, Sandra P Kalil, Paula C Pohl, Glória R Braz, Andrea C Fogaça, Sirlei Daffre"
Genome-wide study of correlations between genomic features and their relationship with the regulation of gene expression,25627242,10.1093/dnares/dsu044,"The broad class of tasks in genetics and epigenetics can be reduced to the study of various features that are distributed over the genome (genome tracks). The rapid and efficient processing of the huge amount of data stored in the genome-scale databases cannot be achieved without the software packages based on the analytical criteria. However, strong inhomogeneity of genome tracks hampers the development of relevant statistics. We developed the criteria for the assessment of genome track inhomogeneity and correlations between two genome tracks. We also developed a software package, Genome Track Analyzer, based on this theory. The theory and software were tested on simulated data and were applied to the study of correlations between CpG islands and transcription start sites in the Homo sapiens genome, between profiles of protein-binding sites in chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster, and between DNA double-strand breaks and histone marks in the H. sapiens genome. Significant correlations between transcription start sites on the forward and the reverse strands were observed in genomes of D. melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, H. sapiens, and Danio rerio. The observed correlations may be related to the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes.

Conservation and evolutionary modifications of neuroblast expression patterns in insects,24525296,10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.01.028,"One of the major questions in evolutionary developmental neurobiology is how neuronal networks have been adapted to different morphologies and behaviour during evolution. Analyses of neurogenesis in representatives of all arthropod species have revealed evolutionary modifications of various developmental mechanisms. Among others, variations can be seen in mechanisms that are associated with changes in neural progenitor identity, which in turn determines the neuronal subtype of their progeny. Comparative analyses of the molecular processes that underlie the generation of neuronal identity might therefore uncover the steps of evolutionary changes that eventually resulted in modifications in neuronal networks. Here we address this question in the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum by analyzing and comparing the development and expression profile of neural stem cells (neuroblasts) to the published neuroblast map of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We show that substantial changes in the identity of neuroblasts have occurred during insect evolution. In almost all neuroblasts the relative positions in the ventral hemi-neuromeres are conserved; however, in over half of the neuroblasts the time of formation as well as the gene expression profile has changed. The neuroblast map presented here can be used for future comparative studies on individual neuroblast lineages in D. melanogaster and T. castaneum and additional markers and information on lineages can be added. Our data suggest that evolutionary changes in the expression profile of individual neuroblasts might have contributed to the evolution of neural diversity and subsequently to changes in neuronal networks in arthropod.",2014,"Lucia Biffar, Angelika Stollewerk, Lucia Biffar, Angelika Stollewerk"
Conservation and sex-specific splicing of the doublesex gene in the economically important pest species Lucilia cuprina,20876994,10.1007/s12041-010-0039-5,"Genetic control of sex determination in insects has been best characterized in Drosophila melanogaster, where the master gene Sxl codes for RNA that is sex specifically spliced to produce a functional protein only in females. SXL regulates the sex-specific splicing of transformer (tra) RNA which, in turn, regulates the splicing of dsx RNA to produce functional male and female proteins. In the Australian sheep blowfly (Lucilia cuprina), the tra gene (Lctra) is required for female development and Lctra transcripts are sex-specifically spliced such that only female Lctra mRNA codes for functional protein. In males, a factor encoded by the Y-linked male determining gene is thought to prevent the female-mode of splicing of Lctra RNA. To further our understanding of the sex determination regulatory hierarchy in L. cuprina, we have isolated the dsx gene (Lcdsx) from this species. We found that the Lcdsx transcripts are sex-specifically spliced in a similar manner as their counterparts in D. melanogaster, housefly and tephritids. The LcDSX proteins are well conserved and the male form of DSX contains a motif encoded by a male-specific exon that is within the female-specific intron. This intron/exon arrangement had previously been found only in the housefly dsx gene, suggesting this may be a unique feature of dsx genes of Calyptratae species.",2010,"Carolina Concha, Fang Li, Maxwell J Scott, Carolina Concha, Fang Li, Maxwell J Scott"

"Intron size, abundance, and distribution within untranslated regions of genes",16980575,10.1093/molbev/msl111,"Most research concerning the evolution of introns has largely considered introns within coding sequences (CDSs), without regard for introns located within untranslated regions (UTRs) of genes. Here, we directly determined intron size, abundance, and distribution in UTRs of genes using full-length cDNA libraries and complete genome sequences for four species, Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, human, and mouse. Overall intron occupancy (introns/exon kbp) is lower in 5' UTRs than CDSs, but intron density (intron occupancy in regions containing introns) tends to be higher in 5' UTRs than in CDSs. Introns in 5' UTRs are roughly twice as large as introns in CDSs, and there is a sharp drop in intron size at the 5' UTR-CDS boundary. We propose a mechanistic explanation for the existence of selection for larger intron size in 5' UTRs, and outline several implications of this hypothesis. We found introns to be randomly distributed within 5' UTRs, so long as a minimum required exon size was assumed. Introns in 3' UTRs were much less abundant than in 5' UTRs. Though this was expected for human and mouse that have intron-dependent nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathways that discourage the presence of introns within the 3' UTR, it was also true for A. thaliana and D. melanogaster, which may lack intron-dependent NMD. Our findings have several implications for theories of intron evolution and genome evolution in general.",2006,"Xin Hong, Douglas G Scofield, Michael Lynch, Xin Hong, Douglas G Scofield, Michael Lynch"
Genetic characterization of geographic populations using morphometrical traits in Drosophila melanogaster: isogroups versus isofemale lines,8522161,10.1007/BF01439574,"Studies of short or medium range geographic variations play an increasing role in ecological genetics, and sensitive techniques are required to detect them. In this respect, two sampling techniques were compared in D. melanogaster. The biological data were provided by the analysis of four natural populations from the same geographic area, Spain (one) and Southern France (three), for four morphometrical traits: abdomen and thoracic pigmentation, and wing and thorax lengths. Traits were measured on wild living females and on their progeny reared in the laboratory at 25 degrees C. For progeny analyses, two techniques were compared: the usual isofemale line technique, sib families issued from a single female, and a new isogroup technique, the progeny produced by a group of 20 wild-collected parents. Large phenotypic variations were observed in wild living flies, corresponding to the unstability of natural environmental conditions during their development. Among laboratory grown flies, variations were much smaller. Between isogroups, differences were small, due to sampling error and some common environment effects. Variations between lines were much greater, thus demonstrating a strong genetic component. When different populations have to be compared, the isogroup technique should be preferred since, for the same amount of work, the lesser variability between groups provides a more precise characterization of the population means.",1995,"B Moreteau, P Capy, A Alonso-Moraga, A Munoz-Serrano, J Stockel, J R David, B Moreteau, P Capy, A Alonso-Moraga, A Munoz-Serrano, J Stockel, J R David"
Mosaic pattern of X-chromosomal transcription in a strain of Drosophila melanogaster with aneuploid X chromosome,2115019,,"Organisation and template activity pattern of salivary gland chromosomes of a segmental male aneuploid of D. melanogaster, carrying duplication for the segment 8C-20F of X chromosome, have been examined by in situ transcription. In an earlier study [Chatterjee, Chromosoma 91 (1985) 259], it was suggested that in male aneuploids, up to an additional length of 8C-20F, the template activity of X chromosome tends to remain at a male level and beyond that level shifts towards female level. A large scale search of the template activity pattern of the aneuploid carrying dp.(8C-20F) clearly indicates that presence of the duplication fragment to X in the normal karyotype (1X2A) lead to a varying degree of condensation of euchromatic regions of entire X chromosome (X + X fragment 8C-20F) starting from 'male' level, over a wide range of 'intermediate' level to a normal 'female' level. In this study, the individual cells of the aneuploid appeared to display their own state of X condensation and transcription. Although in the aneuploid, X chromosomal activity is not determined by a purely quantitative effect of X vs. autosomal material (X:A ratio = 0.81), the 8C-20F segment of X chromosome must contain some major elements concerned with the signal given by X:A ratio for X chromosome differentiation.",1990,"R N Chatterjee, R N Chatterjee"

At generations 4, 12 and 20 the lines were again scored for Adh gene frequencies. Maximum likelihood procedures were used to estimate selection coefficients for the Adh genotypes. An analysis of deviance was used to compare the coefficients against expectations under the hypotheses of neutrality and of constant values for the three base populations, and for the three initial gene frequency classes. Highly-significant departures from neutrality were observed; over all 54 lines, the set of relative fitnesses for S/S:F/S:F/F was estimated as 1.00:1.08:1.08. In addition, there were significant differences between lines in the outcome of selection which were not attributable to differences between base populations or initial F frequencies. These residual between-line differences, as well as some between-generation, within-line differences are discussed in terms of linkage disequilibria with background genes and electrophoretically cryptic variation at the Adh locus.",1982,"S R Wilson, J G Oakeshott, J B Gibson, P R Anderson, S R Wilson, J G Oakeshott, J B Gibson, P R Anderson"
Sensitivity of Drosophila melanogaster to Low concentration of gaseous mutagens: III. Dose-rate effects,6790276,10.1002/em.2860030107,"Sex-linked recessive lethal mutations were induced in D melanogaster males by chronic as well as acute treatments of gaseous 1,2-dibromoethane ranging from 2.3 to 31 ppm.hr. Acute treatments corresponding to each chronic treatment were made by increasing chemical concentration approximately 30 times with a concomitant decrease in exposure period. Germ cell stages sampled, in order of decreasing sensitivity, were spermatocytes, spermatids, and spermatozoa. The most significant finding is that no consistent pattern of difference is observed between acute and chronic exposure for three of the four exposure levels. Only at the highest exposure level (30-31 ppm.hr) was any consistent difference observed between chronic and acute exposure levels. At the higher exposure level in all three germ cell stages the acute exposure showed a significant increase in mutation frequency over the chronic exposure. The greater acute vs chronic mutation frequency for spermatozoa, a metabolically inactive cell stage, leads to the conclusion that the exposure rate effect at high exposure levels is due to systemic factors such as metabolic deactivation or elimination rather than repair of premutational damage in the target cells. The significance of these observations in risk assessment for environmental pollutants is discussed.",1981,"P G Kale, J W Baum, P G Kale, J W Baum"
"[DNA content, replication and transcription rate in different site of the X-chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster]",814408,,Duration of replication period and relative content of DNA and chromosomal newly-synthesized RNA were determined in nine sites of the region 1A1-3C8 in the polytene X-chromosome of D. melanogaster. Determination of DNA content by cytophotometry of Feulgen stained preparations and by autoradiography after long-term [3H]thymidine labeling gave similar results for all nine sites. The smallest portion of the chromosome in which DNA content could be measured by cytophotometry was about 2-10 bands. The mean DNA content per one band measured separately in 25 sites of the 1A1-3C8 region containing 109 bands differs in 8 times. Calculations show that different chromomeres of elementary chromosome (chromatide) contained from 8 to 65 X 10(3) bases pairs. No additional DNA replication was shown to be involved in the process of 2B region puffing. The duration of replication period was found to correlate negatively with the level of the transcription rate in nine sites of the 1A1-3C8 region of the X-chromosome (r = -0.65). The transcription rate correlates negatively with the DNA content in the largest band for each of nine sites.

A conserved CAF40-binding motif in metazoan NOT4 mediates association with the CCR4-NOT complex,30692204,10.1101/gad.320952.118,"The multisubunit CCR4-NOT mRNA deadenylase complex plays important roles in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. The NOT4 E3 ubiquitin ligase is a stable component of the CCR4-NOT complex in yeast but does not copurify with the human or Drosophila melanogaster complex. Here we show that the C-terminal regions of human and D. melanogaster NOT4 contain a conserved sequence motif that directly binds the CAF40 subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex (CAF40-binding motif [CBM]). In addition, nonconserved sequences flanking the CBM also contact other subunits of the complex. Crystal structures of the CBM-CAF40 complex reveal a mutually exclusive binding surface for NOT4 and Roquin or Bag of marbles mRNA regulatory proteins. Furthermore, CAF40 depletion or structure-guided mutagenesis to disrupt the NOT4-CAF40 interaction impairs the ability of NOT4 to elicit decay of tethered reporter mRNAs in cells. Together with additional sequence analyses, our results reveal the molecular basis for the association of metazoan NOT4 with the CCR4-NOT complex and show that it deviates substantially from yeast.

For this purpose, we selected Pumilio (Pum), whose main function is to repress protein translation and has been linked to modulation of neuronal excitability during chronic patterns of altered neuronal activity. Here we explore the effects of Pum on sleep homeostasis in Drosophila melanogaster, which shares most of the major features of mammalian sleep homeostasis. Our evidence indicates that Pum is necessary for sleep rebound and that its effect is more pronounced during chronic sleep deprivation (84 h) than acute deprivation (12 h). Knockdown of pum, results in a reduction of sleep rebound during acute sleep deprivation and the complete abolishment of sleep rebound during chronic sleep deprivation.

Within this framework, we reasoned that in populations of Drosophila melanogaster that have been artificially selected for highly divergent phases of eclosion rhythm, there may be changes in this network of the master-slave oscillator system, via changes in the temperature-sensitive oscillator and/or the coupling of the light- and temperature-sensitive oscillators. We used light/dark cycles in conjunction with different constant ambient temperatures and 2 different amplitudes of temperature cycles in an overall cool or warm temperature and analyzed phases, gate width, and normalized amplitude of the rhythms in each of these conditions.

"Retired flies, hidden plateaus, and the evolution of senescence in Drosophila melanogaster",27166620,10.1111/evo.12946,"Late-life plateaus in age-specific mortality have been an evolutionary and biodemographic puzzle for decades. Although classic theory on the evolution of senescence predicts late-life walls of death, observations in experimental organisms document the opposite trend: a slowing in the rate of increase of mortality at advanced ages. Here, I analyze published life-history data on individual Drosophila melanogaster females and argue for a fundamental change in our understanding of mortality in this important model system. Mortality plateaus are not, as widely assumed, exclusive to late life, and are not explained by population heterogeneity-they are intimately connected to individual fecundity. Female flies begin adult life in the working stage, a period of active oviposition and low but accelerating mortality. Later they transition to the retired stage, a terminal period characterized by limited fecundity and relatively constant mortality. Because ages of transition differ between flies, age-synchronized cohorts contain a mix of working and retired flies. Early- and mid-life plateaus are obscured by the presence of working flies, but can be detected when cohorts are stratified by retirement status. Stage-specificity may be an important component of Drosophila life-history evolution.",2016,"James W Curtsinger, James W Curtsinger"

Missense mutations in RAB7A, the gene encoding the small GTPase Rab7, cause CMT2B and increase Rab7 activity. Rab7 is ubiquitously expressed and is involved in degradation through the lysosomal pathway. In the neurons, Rab7 plays a role in the long-range retrograde transport of signalling endosomes in the axons. Here we developed the first animal model of CMT2B, modelling one of the mutations (L129F) in Drosophila melanogaster. Behavioural assays show that this model recapitulates several hallmarks of the human disease. Upon expression of mutant Rab7 in the sensory neurons, larvae present with a reduction of temperature and pain perception. Furthermore, the larvae exhibit a crawling defect when the mutant protein is expressed in the motor neurons. Analysis of axonal transport of Rab7 positive vesicles in sensory neurons of Drosophila larvae and in neurites of mammalian neuroblastoma cells demonstrates that mutant vesicles pause less than their wild-type counterparts. This latter finding indicates that alterations in vesicle transport might contribute to the pathomechanism of CMT2B.",2014,"Katrien Janssens, Sofie Goethals, Derek Atkinson, Biljana Ermanoska, Erik Fransen, Albena Jordanova, Michaela Auer-Grumbach, Bob Asselbergh, Vincent Timmerman, Katrien Janssens, Sofie Goethals, Derek Atkinson, Biljana Ermanoska, Erik Fransen, Albena Jordanova, Michaela Auer-Grumbach, Bob Asselbergh, Vincent Timmerman"
Serine protease MP2 activates prophenoloxidase in the melanization immune response of Drosophila melanogaster,24260243,10.1371/journal.pone.0079533,"In arthropods, melanization plays a major role in the innate immune response to encapsulate and kill the invasive organisms. It is mediated by a serine protease cascade and is regulated by serpins. The identification of the molecular components of melanization and the regulation of those components are still unclear in Drosophila melanogaster, although some genetic research on the activation of melanization has been reported. Here we report that Drosophila serine protease MP2 directly cleaves both recombinant and native prophenoloxidase-1. Overexpression or repression of MP2 in flies resulted in increased and decreased rates of cleavage, respectively, of prophenoloxidase-1. Moreover, serine protease inhibitor Spn27A formed SDS-stable complexes with MP2, both in vitro and in vivo. The amidase activity of MP2 was inhibited efficiently by Spn27A. Spn27A also prevented MP2 from cleaving prophenoloxidase-1. Taken together, these results indicate that under our experimental conditions MP2 functions as a prophenoloxidase-activating protease, and that this function is inhibited by Spn27A. MP2 and Spn27A thus constitute a regulatory unit in the prophenoloxidase activation cascade in Drosophila. The combination of genetic, molecular genetic and biochemical approaches should allow further advances in our understanding of the prophenoloxidase-activating cascade in insects and indirectly shed further light on protease-cascades in humans and other vertebrates.",2013,"Chunju An, Mingming Zhang, Yuan Chu, Zhangwu Zhao, Chunju An, Mingming Zhang, Yuan Chu, Zhangwu Zhao"
Nora virus persistent infections are not affected by the RNAi machinery,19478998,10.1371/journal.pone.0005731,"Drosophila melanogaster is widely used to decipher the innate immune system in response to various pathogens. The innate immune response towards persistent virus infections is among the least studied in this model system. We recently discovered a picorna-like virus, the Nora virus which gives rise to persistent and essentially symptom-free infections in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we have used this virus to study the interaction with its host and with some of the known Drosophila antiviral immune pathways. First, we find a striking variability in the course of the infection, even between flies of the same inbred stock. Some flies are able to clear the Nora virus but not others. This phenomenon seems to be threshold-dependent; flies with a high-titer infection establish stable persistent infections, whereas flies with a lower level of infection are able to clear the virus. Surprisingly, we find that both the clearance of low-level Nora virus infections and the stability of persistent infections are unaffected by mutations in the RNAi pathways. Nora virus infections are also unaffected by mutations in the Toll and Jak-Stat pathways. In these respects, the Nora virus differs from other studied Drosophila RNA viruses.",2009,"Mazen S Habayeb, Jens-Ola Ekström, Dan Hultmark, Mazen S Habayeb, Jens-Ola Ekström, Dan Hultmark"
The RNA silencing endonuclease Argonaute 2 mediates specific antiviral immunity in Drosophila melanogaster,17079687,10.1101/gad.1482006,"Most organisms have evolved defense mechanisms to protect themselves from viruses and other pathogens. Arthropods lack the protein-based adaptive immune response found in vertebrates. Here we show that the central catalytic component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), the nuclease Argonaute 2 (Ago-2), is essential for antiviral defense in adult Drosophila melanogaster. Ago-2-defective flies are hypersensitive to infection with a major fruit fly pathogen, Drosophila C virus (DCV), and with Cricket Paralysis virus (CrPV). Increased mortality in ago-2 mutant flies was associated with a dramatic increase in viral RNA accumulation and virus titers. The physiological significance of this antiviral mechanism is underscored by our finding that DCV encodes a potent suppressor of RNA interference (RNAi). This suppressor binds long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and inhibits Dicer-2-mediated processing of dsRNA into short interfering RNA (siRNA), but does not bind short siRNAs or disrupt the microRNA (miRNA) pathway. Based on these results we propose that RNAi is a major antiviral immune defense mechanism in Drosophila.",2006,"Ronald P van Rij, Maria-Carla Saleh, Bassam Berry, Catherine Foo, Andrew Houk, Christophe Antoniewski, Raul Andino, Ronald P van Rij, Maria-Carla Saleh, Bassam Berry, Catherine Foo, Andrew Houk, Christophe Antoniewski, Raul Andino"
Identification and molecular cloning of a functional GDP-fucose transporter in Drosophila melanogaster,15530860,10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.08.043,"Nucleotide sugar transporters play a central role in the process of glycosylation. They are responsible for the translocation of nucleotide sugars from the cytosol, their site of synthesis, into the Golgi apparatus where the activated sugars serve as substrates for a variety of glycosyltransferases. We and others have recently identified and cloned the first GDP-fucose transporters of H. sapiens and C. elegans. Based on sequence similarity, we could identify a putative homolog in Drosophila melanogaster showing about 45% identity on protein level. The gene (CG9620) encodes a highly hydrophobic, multi-transmembrane spanning protein of 38.1 kDa that is localized in the Golgi apparatus. In order to test whether this protein serves as a GDP-fucose transporter, we performed complementation studies with fibroblasts from a patient with LADII (leukocyte adhesion deficiency II) which exhibit a strong reduction of fucosylation due to a point mutation in the human GDP-fucose transporter gene. We show that transient transfection of these cells with the Drosophila CG9620 cDNA corrects the GDP-fucose transport defect and reestablishes fucosylation. This study gives experimental proof that the product of the in silico identified Drosophila gene CG9620 serves as a functional GDP-fucose transporter.",2004,"Kerstin Lühn, Anna Laskowska, Jan Pielage, Christian Klämbt, Ute Ipe, Dietmar Vestweber, Martin K Wild, Kerstin Lühn, Anna Laskowska, Jan Pielage, Christian Klämbt, Ute Ipe, Dietmar Vestweber, Martin K Wild"
"A copper-regulated transporter required for copper acquisition, pigmentation, and specific stages of development in Drosophila melanogaster",12966081,10.1074/jbc.M309820200,"The trace element copper is required for normal growth and development, serving as an essential catalytic co-factor for enzymes involved in energy generation, oxidative stress protection, neuropeptide maturation, and other fundamental processes. In yeast and mammals copper acquisition occurs through the action of the Ctr1 family of high affinity copper transporters. Here we describe studies using Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the role of copper acquisition through Ctr1 in normal growth and development. Three distinct Drosophila Ctr1 genes (Ctr1A, Ctr1B, and Ctr1C) have been identified, which have unique expression patterns over the course of development. Interestingly, Ctr1B, which is expressed exclusively during the late embryonic and larval stages of development, is transcriptionally activated in response to nutritionally induced copper deprivation and down-regulated in response to copper adequacy. The generation of Ctr1B mutant flies results in decreased larval copper accumulation, marked body pigmentation defects that parallel defects in tyrosinase activity, and specific developmental arrest under conditions of both nutritional copper limitation and excess. These studies establish that copper acquisition through the Drosophila Ctr1B transporter is crucial for normal growth and in early and specific stages of metazoan development.",2003,"Hao Zhou, Ken M Cadigan, Dennis J Thiele, Hao Zhou, Ken M Cadigan, Dennis J Thiele"
The hsp60B gene of Drosophila melanogaster is essential for the spermatid individualization process,11525246,10.1379/1466-1268(2001)006<0071:thgodm>2.0.co;2,"The 60-kDa heat shock protein family (Hsp60) is found in prokaryotes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. The Hsp60 proteins promote proper protein folding by preventing aggregation. In Drosophila melanogaster, the hsp60 gene is essential for a variety of developmental processes, beginning at early embryogenesis. In this study we show that an additional member of the Drosophila hsp60 gene family, hsp60B, is essential in male fertility. In males homozygous for a mutation of the hsp60B gene, developmental processes appeared normal throughout most of spermatogenesis, including spermatocyte growth, meiosis, and spermatid elongation. At these stages, mitochondria also displayed a differentiation process similar to wild-types. However, we found that the mutation disrupted a late stage of spermatogenesis, the spermatid individualization process. In this process, the individualization complex is assembled at spermatid nuclear heads, traverses along spermatid tails, and generates membranes for each of the spermatids in a cyst. Our analysis further shows that the individualization complex in sterile males displayed abnormal morphology as it was traveling along the spermatid tails. The Drosophila Hsp60 proteins are believed to be exclusively localized in the mitochondria. Our observation that the hsp60B mutation displayed no apparent defect in mitochondrial differentiation during spermatogenesis suggests that the Hsp60B protein may operate in a nonmitochondrial location.",2001,"B Timakov, P Zhang, B Timakov, P Zhang"
Distinct requirements for the AP-3 adaptor complex in pigment granule and synaptic vesicle biogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,10954086,10.1007/pl00008688,"The AP-3 adaptor protein complex has been implicated in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, such as pigment granules/melanosomes, and synaptic vesicles. Here we compare the relative importance of AP-3 in the biogenesis of these organelles in Drosophila melanogaster. We report that the Drosophila pigmentation mutants orange and ruby carry genetic lesions in the sigma3 and beta3-adaptin subunits of the AP-3 complex, respectively. Electron microscopy reveals dramatic reductions in the numbers of electron-dense pigment granules in the eyes of these AP-3 mutants. Mutant flies also display greatly reduced levels of pigments housed in these granules. In contrast, electron microscopy of retinula cells reveals numerous synaptic vesicles in both AP-3 mutant and wild-type flies, while behavioral assays show apparently normal locomotor ability of AP-3 mutant larvae. Together, these results demonstrate that Drosophila AP-3 is critical for the biogenesis of pigment granules, but is apparently not essential for formation of a major population of synaptic vesicles in vivo.",2000,"C Mullins, L M Hartnell, J S Bonifacino, C Mullins, L M Hartnell, J S Bonifacino"
DNA repair defects and other (mus)takes in Drosophila melanogaster,10454999,10.1006/meth.1999.0797,"Preservation of the structural integrity of DNA in any organism is crucial to its health and survival. Such preservation is achieved by an extraordinary cellular arsenal of damage surveillance and repair functions, many of which are now being defined at the gene and protein levels. Mutants hypersensitive to the killing effects of DNA-damaging agents have been instrumental in helping to identify DNA repair-related genes and to elucidate repair mechanisms. In Drosophila melanogaster, such strains are generally referred to as mutagen-sensitive (mus) mutants and currently define more than 30 genetic loci. Whereas most mus mutants have been recovered on the basis of hypersensitivity to the monofunctional alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate, they nevertheless constitute a phenotypically diverse group, with many mutants having effects beyond mutagen sensitivity. These phenotypes include meiotic dysfunctions, somatic chromosome instabilities, chromatin abnormalities, and cell proliferation defects.

Effect of tryptophan metabolites on fluorescent granules in the Malpighian tubules of eye color mutants of Drosophila melanogaster,8688814,10.2108/zsj.13.97,"Fluorescent granules that are stained with Nile blue sulfate are present in larval Malpighian tubules in the wild type strain of Drosophila melanogaster, Oregon-R. These granules emit a weak blue fluorescence and most of them are about 2 microns or more in diameter. The ommochrome precursor 3-hydroxy-kynurenine (3-HK) is actively transferred into the tubules of Oregon-R. Changes in the fluorescent granules in the Malpighian tubules on administration of ommochrome precursors were investigated in eye color mutants of Drosophila. The fluorescent granules in the tubules of the nonautonomous mutants v;bw and cn bw emit a strong blue fluorescence and most of them are about 1 micron or less in diameter. When v;bw and cn bw larvae were cultured on medium supplemented with kynurenine or 3-HK, respectively, the fluorescence intensity of their granules decreased, and their size increased. These additions resulted in almost equal accumulation of 3-HK to that in Oregon-R. On the other hand, no 3-HK accumulated in the tubules of larvae of the autonomous mutants bw;st, ltd bw and w, which lack the fluorescent granules.

DRP-A from ovaries was separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis into multiple phosphorylated species that include a previously unresolved form of RP-A. These forms are developmentally regulated with a major phosphorylated form appearing at stage 11 of oogenesis and persisting into mature eggs. Actively cycling early embryos were examined to investigate DNA replication in the absence of repair synthesis due to perturbation by drugs or mutation. An oscillation of the two major forms of DPR-A was observed over multiple cell cycles. The phosphorylated form was most abundant at mitosis and the nonphosphorylated form at interphase. In contrast to other systems where a phosphorylated form of RP-A has been correlated with S phase, only the nonphosphorylated form of Drosophila RP-A is observed in early Drosophila embryos during DNA replication. Consistent with this role in DNA metabolism, DRP-A was localized to the nucleus. Subsequently at mitosis, DRP-A becomes delocalized. Strikingly, in ovaries a relatively large amount of DRP-A was observed during the early mitotic stages of oogenesis.",1995,"P G Mitsis, P G Mitsis"

To date, all characterized nonsense suppressors in C. elegans have been derived from tRNA(Trp) genes. Suppression was assayed by monitoring the reversal of a mutant tra-3 phenotype among individuals transformed with the cloned Drosophila suppressor gene. An amber allele of tra-3 results in masculinization of XX animals with accompanying sterility. Complete suppression was observed among the transformants. The presence of the heterologous transgene, in both suppressed experimental animals and controls injected with a non-suppressing wild-type Drosophila tRNA(Ser) gene, was verified by PCR amplification of DNA from single worms using primers flanking the tRNA(Ser) gene. Suppression by the heterologous transgene was comparable in quality to that produced by endogenous C. elegans suppressors, and, in frequency as well as quality, to that produced by a transgenic C. elegans tRNA(Trp)-derived suppressors. Thus, a heterologous suppressor gene will function in C. elegans, and it need not be based on tRNA(Trp).",1993,"D B Pilgrim, J B Bell, D B Pilgrim, J B Bell"

One scheme is referred to as FIX, in which the female carried free (heterozygously) inverted X (chromosomes) and the other, ZESTE, where females do not carry inversions and the X-linked sexually dimorphic zeste mutation plays the key role in the detection of aneuploid offspring. The principle attribute of the FIX system is that all euploid offspring are wild-type for body and eye color whereas aneuploid females have a yellow body and aneuploid males white eyes; int he ZESTE system all euploid individuals are wild-type for eye color, aneuploid females possess zeste-colored eyes and aneuploid males white eyes. In addition induced polyploidies (2X:2A gametes) appear as yellow and zeste male intersexes in the FIX and ZESTE systems, respectively. In this way all aneuploids are recognized immediately. Consequently, detection of compounds with weak effects requiring large sample sizes may be made in a fraction of the time associated with more traditional schemes for aneuploidy detection in Drosophila.",1990,"S Zimmering, C Osgood, J M Mason, S Zimmering, C Osgood, J M Mason"
The influence of serotonin and p-chlorophenylalanine on locomotor activity of Drosophila melanogaster,6222385,10.1016/0091-3057(83)90005-9,"Two hours after injection of serotonin into 3-day-old virgin females of Drosophila melanogaster, a significant dose-dependent increase in locomotor activity was observed. Since this stimulating effect can be produced either by serotonin or by some of its derivatives that might have formed during these two hours, the fate of injected [3H]-serotonin in the organism of Drosophila was traced by means of thin layer chromatography. The only metabolite found appeared to be N-acetylserotonin. Its formation was rather intense immediately after injection of [3H]-serotonin, and its excretion was rapid enough to make it undetectable at the end of the second hour, when more than 50% of the injected [3H]-serotonin still remained and was being absorbed by tissues. Thus, the increase in locomotor activity observed two hours after injection should be wholly attributed to serotonin, while the rather long latency might be related to some effect of N-acetylserotonin. p-Chlorophenylalanine, an inhibitor of tryptophan-5-hydroxylase, both injected or administered with food, led to increases in locomotor activity level and to some decreases in serotonin content in the heads of flies. The effect of p-chlorophenylalanine on locomotor activity in Drosophila seems to be non-specific in relation to serotoninergic mechanisms of its regulation.",1983,"N G Kamyshev, G P Smirnova, E V Savvateeva, A V Medvedeva, V V Ponomarenko, N G Kamyshev, G P Smirnova, E V Savvateeva, A V Medvedeva, V V Ponomarenko"

Elevated DNA damage was observed in the wing imaginal disc of dLipin-knockdown flies. dLipin dysfunction induced accumulation of cells in S phase and significantly reduced the number of mitotic cells, indicating DNA damage-induced activation of the G2/M checkpoint. Reduced expression of cyclin B, which is critical for the G2 to M transition, was observed in the margin of the wing imaginal disc of dLipin-knockdown flies.

The role of variant histone H2AV in Drosophila melanogaster larval hematopoiesis,28242611,10.1242/dev.142729,"Replication-independent histone variants can replace the canonical replication-dependent histones. Vertebrates have multiple H2A variant histones, including H2AZ and H2AX that are present in most eukaryotes. H2AZ regulates transcriptional activation as well as the maintenance of gene silencing, while H2AX is important in DNA damage repair. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has only one histone H2A variant (H2AV), which is a chimera of H2AZ and H2AX. In this study we found that lack of H2AV led to the formation of black melanotic masses in Drosophila third instar larvae. The formation of these masses was found in conjunction with a loss of the majority of the primary lymph gland lobes. Interestingly, the cells of the posterior signaling center were preserved in these mutants. Reduction of H2AV levels by RNAi knockdown caused a milder phenotype that preserved the lymph gland structure but that included precocious differentiation of the prohemocytes located within the medullary zone and the secondary lobes of the lymph gland. Mutant rescue experiments suggest that the H2AZ-like rather than the H2AX-like function of H2AV is primarily required for normal hematopoiesis.",2017,"Melina Grigorian, Heather DeBruhl, Joseph S Lipsick, Melina Grigorian, Heather DeBruhl, Joseph S Lipsick"

Pdf plays a crucial role in maintaining free-running circadian periods. The cry gene alters blue-light (<420 nm) phototransduction which affects biological clocks, spatial orientation and taxis relative to gravity, magnetic fields, solar, lunar, and celestial radiation in several species. The cry gene is involved in phase resetting (entrainment) of the circadian clock by blue light (<420 nm). Geotaxis involves spatial orientation, so it might be expected that geotaxis is linked genetically with other forms of spatial orientation. The association between geotaxis and biological clocks is less intuitive.

Drosophila rely on learning while foraging under semi-natural conditions,24324865,10.1002/ece3.783,"Learning is predicted to affect manifold ecological and evolutionary processes, but the extent to which animals rely on learning in nature remains poorly known, especially for short-lived non-social invertebrates. This is in particular the case for Drosophila, a favourite laboratory system to study molecular mechanisms of learning. Here we tested whether Drosophila melanogaster use learned information to choose food while free-flying in a large greenhouse emulating the natural environment. In a series of experiments flies were first given an opportunity to learn which of two food odours was associated with good versus unpalatable taste; subsequently, their preference for the two odours was assessed with olfactory traps set up in the greenhouse. Flies that had experienced palatable apple-flavoured food and unpalatable orange-flavoured food were more likely to be attracted to the odour of apple than flies with the opposite experience. This was true both when the flies first learned in the laboratory and were then released and recaptured in the greenhouse, and when the learning occurred under free-flying conditions in the greenhouse. Furthermore, flies retained the memory of their experience while exploring the greenhouse overnight in the absence of focal odours, pointing to the involvement of consolidated memory.

Here we establish Drosophila melanogaster as an inexpensive, flexible, and powerful genetic model system for NIHL. We exposed flies to acoustic trauma and quantified physiological and anatomical effects. Trauma significantly reduced sound-evoked potential (SEP) amplitudes and increased SEP latencies in control genotypes. SEP amplitude but not latency effects recovered after 7 d. Although trauma produced no gross morphological changes in the auditory organ (Johnston's organ), mitochondrial cross-sectional area was reduced 7 d after exposure.

Ultrastructural analysis of wild type and mutant Drosophila melanogaster using helium ion microscopy,23850418,10.1016/j.micron.2013.06.005,"Insects have evolved numerous adaptations to survive a variety of environmental conditions. Given that the primary interface between insects and the environment is mediated through their skin or cuticle, many of these adaptations are found in extraordinary cuticle diversity both in morphology and structure. Not all of these adaptions manifest themselves in changes in the chemical composition of the cuticle but rather as elaborations of the surface structures of the cuticle. Typically the examination of these micro- and nanoscale structures has been performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Typically, in order to decrease surface charging and increase resolution, an obscuring conductive layer is applied to the sample surface, but this layer limits the ability to identify nanoscale surface structures. In this paper we use a new technology, helium ion microscopy (HIM) to examine surface structures on the cuticle of wild type and mutant Drosophila. Helium ion microscopy permits high resolution imaging of biological samples without the need for coating. We compare HIM to traditional SEM and demonstrate certain advantages of this type of microscopy, with our focus being high resolution characterization of nanostructures on the cuticle of Drosophila melanogaster and potentially other biological specimens.",2013,"Adam Boseman, Kyle Nowlin, Sarmadia Ashraf, Jijin Yang, Dennis Lajeunesse, Adam Boseman, Kyle Nowlin, Sarmadia Ashraf, Jijin Yang, Dennis Lajeunesse"
Dopamine modulates metabolic rate and temperature sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster,22347491,10.1371/journal.pone.0031513,"Homeothermal animals, such as mammals, maintain their body temperature by heat generation and heat dissipation, while poikilothermal animals, such as insects, accomplish it by relocating to an environment of their favored temperature. Catecholamines are known to regulate thermogenesis and metabolic rate in mammals, but their roles in other animals are poorly understood. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has been used as a model system for the genetic studies of temperature preference behavior. Here, we demonstrate that metabolic rate and temperature sensitivity of some temperature sensitive behaviors are regulated by dopamine in Drosophila. Temperature-sensitive molecules like dTrpA1 and shi(ts) induce temperature-dependent behavioral changes, and the temperature at which the changes are induced were lowered in the dopamine transporter-defective mutant, fumin. The mutant also displays a preference for lower temperatures. This thermophobic phenotype was rescued by the genetic recovery of the dopamine transporter in dopamine neurons. Flies fed with a dopamine biosynthesis inhibitor (3-iodo-L-tyrosine), which diminishes dopamine signaling, exhibited preference for a higher temperature. Furthermore, we found that the metabolic rate is up-regulated in the fumin mutant. Taken together, dopamine has functions in the temperature sensitivity of behavioral changes and metabolic rate regulation in Drosophila, as well as its previously reported functions in arousal/sleep regulation.",2012,"Taro Ueno, Jun Tomita, Shoen Kume, Kazuhiko Kume, Taro Ueno, Jun Tomita, Shoen Kume, Kazuhiko Kume"
Functional expression of recombinant canstatin in stably transformed Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells,17208009,10.1016/j.pep.2006.11.016,We describe the expression and in vitro activity of recombinant canstatin from stably transformed Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. Southern blot analysis indicated that transformed S2 cells contained multiple copies of the canstatin gene in the genome. Recombinant canstatin with a molecular weight of 29kDa was secreted into the culture medium. Recombinant canstatin was purified to homogeneity using a simple one-step Ni(2+) affinity fractionation. Purified recombinant canstatin inhibited human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The concentration at half-maximum inhibition (ED(50)) for recombinant canstatin expressed in stably transformed Drosophila S2 cells was approximately 0.37mug/ml.

Using nanoscale liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry and data base mining, we analyzed the peptidome of the larval Drosophila central nervous system at the amino acid sequence level. We were able to provide biochemical evidence for the presence of 28 neuropeptides using an extract of only 50 larval Drosophila central nervous systems. Eighteen of these peptides are encoded in previously cloned or annotated precursor genes, although not all of them were predicted correctly. Eleven of these peptides were never purified before.

Dopamine and mushroom bodies in Drosophila: experience-dependent and -independent aspects of sexual behavior,10454380,,"Depletion of dopamine in Drosophila melanogaster adult males, accomplished through systemic introduction of the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor 3-iodo-tyrosine, severely impaired the ability of these flies to modify their courtship responses to immature males. Mature males, when first exposed to immature males, will perform courtship rituals; the intensity and duration of this behavior rapidly diminishes with time. Dopamine is also required for normal female sexual receptivity; dopamine-depleted females show increased latency to copulation. One kilobase of 5' upstream information from the Drosophila tyrosine hydroxylase (DTH) gene, when fused to the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase reporter and transduced into the genome of Drosophila melanogaster, is capable of directing expression of the reporter gene in the mushroom bodies, which are believed to mediate learning acquisition and memory retention in flies. Ablation of mushroom bodies by treatment of newly hatched larva with hydroxyurea resulted in the inability of treated mature adult males to cease courtship when placed with untreated immature males. However, functional mushroom bodies were not required for the dopaminergic modulation of an innate behavior, female sexual receptivity. These data suggest that dopamine acts as a signaling molecule within the mushroom bodies to mediate a simple form of learning.",1998,"W S Neckameyer, W S Neckameyer"
DSP1 gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes an HMG-domain protein that plays multiple roles in development,9883584,10.1002/(SICI)1520-6408(1998)23:4<324::AID-DVG7>3.0.CO;2-T,"DSP1 is an HMG-box containing protein of Drosophila melanogaster which was first identified as a co-repressor of the Dorsal protein. Recently, the analysis of the structure of the gene has led us to propose that DSP1 is the Drosophila equivalent of the ubiquitous vertebrate HMG 1/2 proteins. In the present paper, the patterns of expression of DSP1 protein and RNA in adult flies and during development are reported. In the adults DSP1 protein is located in nurse cells of ovaries and in brain. During eggs development uniform expression of DSP1 protein persists until the end of germband retraction. At later stages, expression is restricted to the ventral nerve chord and brain. Using P-element mutagenesis, we have isolated a mutant deficient in DSP1 functions. Genetic studies of this mutant show that DSP1 protein is essential for the growth and the development of Drosophila. In addition to be a co-repressor of the transcriptional activator Dorsal our results provide compelling evidence that DSP1 is a regulator involved in several pathways necessary for the development of the fly.",1998,"C Mosrin-Huaman, L Canaple, D Locker, M Decoville, C Mosrin-Huaman, L Canaple, D Locker, M Decoville"
The 190 kDa centrosome-associated protein of Drosophila melanogaster contains four zinc finger motifs and binds to specific sites on polytene chromosomes,8586650,,"Microinjection of a bacterially expressed, TRITC labelled fragment of the centrosome-associated protein CP190 of Drosophila melanogaster, into syncytial Drosophila embryos, shows it to associate with the centrosomes during mitosis, and to relocate to chromatin during interphase. Indirect immunofluorescence staining of salivary gland chromosomes of third instar Drosophila larvae, with antibodies specific to CP190, indicate that the protein is associated with a large number of loci on these interphase polytene chromosomes. The 190 kDa CP190 protein is encoded by a 4.1 kb transcript with a single, long open reading frame specifying a polypeptide of 1,096 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 120 kDa, and an isoelectric point of 4.5. The central region of the predicted amino acid sequence of the CP190 protein contains four CysX2CysX12HisX4His zinc-finger motifs which are similar to those described for several well characterised DNA binding proteins.

The Drosophila melanogaster suppressor of Hairy-wing zinc finger protein has minimal effects on gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,8243999,,"Many mutations in Drosophila melanogaster are gypsy retrotransposon insertions. Gypsy binds the protein (SUHW) encoded by the suppressor of Hairy-wing [su(Hw)] gene, and SUHW alters expression of surrounding genes. When gypsy is between an enhancer and promoter, SUHW blocks activation of transcription by the enhancer. Additionally, when gypsy is downstream of a promoter in a parallel orientation, SUHW increases truncation of transcripts at the poly(A) site in the gypsy 5' long terminal repeat, thereby decreasing the gene transcript levels. The effects of SUHW appear to involve fundamental and general mechanisms controlling gene expression because SUHW potentiates other poly(A) sites and blocks several enhancers in Drosophila. To investigate these mechanisms, SUHW was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although SUHW enters the nucleus and binds DNA in yeast, it has surprisingly minor effects on utilization of the CYC1 poly(A) site and transcription activation by a GAL upstream activation sequence. These observations indicate that the observed effects of SUHW on gene expression in Drosophila require specific interactions with other factors that are absent or unrecognizable in yeast.",1993,"J Kim, B Shen, D Dorsett, J Kim, B Shen, D Dorsett"
A gene related to the proto-oncogene fps/fes is expressed at diverse times during the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster,1898762,10.1128/mcb.11.1.226,"The proto-oncogene fps/fes encodes a distinctive type of protein-tyrosine kinase.

Expression of the gene is entirely zygotic in origin and occurs throughout the life cycle. But hybridization in situ revealed that the pattern of expression is specialized and evolves in a provocative manner. The most notable feature of expression is the diversity of developmental periods, tissues, and cells in which it occurs. In some tissues, expression is transient; in others, it is continuous. Expression occurs in both mitotic and terminally differentiated tissue and, at various times in development, is prominent in imaginal disks, gut, muscle, testes, ovaries, retina, and other neural tissues. It appears that the use of dfps85D is more diversified than that of other Drosophila protein-tyrosine kinases reported to date and contrasts sharply with the restricted expression of fps itself in vertebrates.

Partial purification and some properties of biopterin synthase and dihydropterin oxidase from Drosophila melanogaster,114164,10.1007/BF00498975,"An enzyme which has been named ""biopterin synthase"" has been discovered in Drosophila melanogaster. This enzyme, which has been purified 200-fold from extracts of Drosophila, catalyzes the conversion of sepiapterin to dihydrobiopterin, or oxidized sepiapterin to biopterin. The Km values for the two substrates are 63 microM for sepiapterin and 10 microM for oxidized sepiapterin. NADPH is required in this enzymatic reaction. An analysis of enzyme activity during development in Drosophila indicates a correlation between enzyme activity and biopterin content at various development stages. Another enzyme, called ""dihyropterin oxidase,"" was also discovered and partially purified. This enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of dihydropterin compounds to the corresponding pterin compounds. For example, sepiapterin (a dihydroterin) is oxidized to oxidized sepiapterin in the presence of this enzyme. The only dihydropterin that has been tested that is not a substrate for this enzyme is dihydroneopterin triphosphate, the compound thought to be a precursor for all naturally occurring pterins and dihydropterins. Since the action of dihydropterin oxidase is reduced significantly when the concentration of oxygen is very low, it is likely that this enzyme uses molecular oxygen as the oxidizing agent during the oxidation of dihydropterins. Neither NAD+ or NADP+ is required. In the presence of the two enzymes dihydropterin oxidase and biopterin synthase, sepiapterin is converted to biopterin. However, in the presence of biopterin synthase alone, sepiapterin is converted to dihydrobiopterin.",1979,"C L Fan, G M Brown, C L Fan, G M Brown"
Effects of increased partial pressures of oxygen on the embryonic and post-embryonic development of drosophila melanogaster,803832,,"The objective of this investigation was to study the effects of increased oxygen pressures on the development of Drosophila melanogaster. Oxygen is a potent inhibitor of embryonic and post-embryonic development of Drosophila. The lowest partial pressure of O2 (Po2) found to elicit measurable inhibitory effects on development is 0.6 ATA. Continuous exposure of developing Drosophila to 0.6 ATA O2 elicits primarily a larvicidal effect; surviving larvae exhibit delays in initial puparium formation and in mean day of adult eclosion: several resultant adults exhibit the effects of O2-induced teratogenesis in that body and wing abnormalities become manifest which do not breed true on matings and back crosses. Continuous exposure to 0.8 or 1.0 ATA O2 results in developmental arrest in the second larval instar followed by death. This development arrest is reversible depending upon the duration of exposure. As concerns lethality, early larval stages are more sensitive to O2 than late larval stages which, in turn, are more sensitive than early or late pupal stages: the embryo is the more resistant of the development stages. As concerns sensitivity for teratogenesis, the embryo is the most sensitive stage.",1975,"S L Smith, S F Gottlieb, S L Smith, S F Gottlieb"
Late replication domains are evolutionary conserved in the Drosophila genome,24391753,10.1371/journal.pone.0083319,"Drosophila chromosomes are organized into distinct domains differing in their predominant chromatin composition, replication timing and evolutionary conservation. We show on a genome-wide level that genes whose order has remained unaltered across 9 Drosophila species display late replication timing and frequently map to the regions of repressive chromatin. This observation is consistent with the existence of extensive domains of repressive chromatin that replicate extremely late and have conserved gene order in the Drosophila genome. We suggest that such repressive chromatin domains correspond to a handful of regions that complete replication at the very end of S phase. We further demonstrate that the order of genes in these regions is rarely altered in evolution. Substantial proportion of such regions significantly coincide with large synteny blocks. This indicates that there are evolutionary mechanisms maintaining the integrity of these late-replicating chromatin domains.

Nup160 encodes a nuclear pore complex protein and shows evidence of adaptive evolution.

In this study, we identify six regions of the Drosophila brain essential for dialect training. We pinpoint subgroups of neurons in these regions, including motion detecting neurons in the optic lobe, layer 5 of the fan-shaped body, the D glomerulus in the antennal lobe, and the odorant receptor Or69a, where activation of each component is necessary for dialect learning.

Protective effect of (-)-α-bisabolol on rotenone-induced toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster,28881148,10.1139/cjpp-2017-0207,"(-)-α-Bisabolol (BISA) is a sesquiterpene alcohol, which has several recognized biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-irritant, and antibacterial properties. In the present study, we investigated the influence of BISA (5, 25, and 250 μmol/L) on rotenone (500 μmol/L)-induced toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster for 7 days. BISA supplementation significantly decreased rotenone-induced mortality and locomotor deficits. The loss of motor function induced by rotenone correlated with a significant change in stress response factors; it decreased thiol levels, inhibited mitochondria complex I, and increased the mRNA expression of antioxidant marker proteins such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and the keap1 gene product. Taken together, our findings indicate that the toxicity of rotenone is likely due to the direct inhibition of complex I activity, resulting in a high level of oxidative stress. Dietary supplementation with BISA affected the expression of SOD mRNA only at a concentration of 250 μmol/L, and did not affect any other parameter measured. Our results showed a protective effect of BISA on rotenone-induced mortality and locomotor deficits in Drosophila; this effect did not correlate with mitochondrial complex I activity, but may be related to the antioxidant protection afforded by eliminating superoxide generated as a result of rotenone-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.",2018,"Gerlânia de Oliveira Leite, Assis Ecker, Rodrigo Lopes Seeger, Bárbara Nunes Krum, Thiago Henrique Lugokenski, Roselei Fachinetto, Jéssie Haigert Sudati, Nilda Vargas Barbosa, Caroline Wagner, Gerlânia de Oliveira Leite, Assis Ecker, Rodrigo Lopes Seeger, Bárbara Nunes Krum, Thiago Henrique Lugokenski, Roselei Fachinetto, Jéssie Haigert Sudati, Nilda Vargas Barbosa, Caroline Wagner"
Phenotypic Plasticity through Transcriptional Regulation of the Evolutionary Hotspot Gene tan in Drosophila melanogaster,27508387,10.1371/journal.pgen.1006218,"Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of a given genotype to produce different phenotypes in response to distinct environmental conditions. Phenotypic plasticity can be adaptive. Furthermore, it is thought to facilitate evolution. Although phenotypic plasticity is a widespread phenomenon, its molecular mechanisms are only beginning to be unravelled. Environmental conditions can affect gene expression through modification of chromatin structure, mainly via histone modifications, nucleosome remodelling or DNA methylation, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity might partly be due to chromatin plasticity. As a model of phenotypic plasticity, we study abdominal pigmentation of Drosophila melanogaster females, which is temperature sensitive. Abdominal pigmentation is indeed darker in females grown at 18°C than at 29°C. This phenomenon is thought to be adaptive as the dark pigmentation produced at lower temperature increases body temperature. We show here that temperature modulates the expression of tan (t), a pigmentation gene involved in melanin production. t is expressed 7 times more at 18°C than at 29°C in female abdominal epidermis. Genetic experiments show that modulation of t expression by temperature is essential for female abdominal pigmentation plasticity. Temperature modulates the activity of an enhancer of t without modifying compaction of its chromatin or level of the active histone mark H3K27ac. By contrast, the active mark H3K4me3 on the t promoter is strongly modulated by temperature. The H3K4 methyl-transferase involved in this process is likely Trithorax, as we show that it regulates t expression and the H3K4me3 level on the t promoter and also participates in female pigmentation and its plasticity. Interestingly, t was previously shown to be involved in inter-individual variation of female abdominal pigmentation in Drosophila melanogaster, and in abdominal pigmentation divergence between Drosophila species. Sensitivity of t expression to environmental conditions might therefore give more substrate for selection, explaining why this gene has frequently been involved in evolution of pigmentation.",2016,"Jean-Michel Gibert, Emmanuèle Mouchel-Vielh, Sandra De Castro, Frédérique Peronnet, Jean-Michel Gibert, Emmanuèle Mouchel-Vielh, Sandra De Castro, Frédérique Peronnet"
Conserved role of Drosophila melanogaster FoxP in motor coordination and courtship song,24747661,10.1016/j.bbr.2014.04.009,"FoxP2 is a highly conserved vertebrate transcription factor known for its importance in human speech and language production. Disruption of FoxP2 in several vertebrate models indicates a conserved functional role for this gene in both sound production and motor coordination. Although FoxP2 is known to be strongly expressed in brain regions important for motor coordination, little is known about FoxP2's role in the nervous system. The recent discovery of the well-conserved Drosophila melanogaster homolog, FoxP, provides an opportunity to study the role of this crucial gene in an invertebrate model. We hypothesized that, like FoxP2, Drosophila FoxP is important for behaviors requiring fine motor coordination. We used targeted RNA interference to reduce expression of FoxP and assayed the effects on a variety of adult behaviors. Male flies with reduced FoxP expression exhibit decreased levels of courtship behavior, altered pulse-song structure, and sex-specific motor impairments in walking and flight. Acute disruption of synaptic activity in FoxP expressing neurons using a temperature-sensitive shibire allele dramatically impaired motor coordination. Utilizing a GFP reporter to visualize FoxP in the fly brain reveals expression in relatively few neurons in distributed clusters within the larval and adult CNS, including distinct labeling of the adult protocerebral bridge - a section of the insect central complex known to be important for motor coordination and thought to be homologous to areas of the vertebrate basal ganglia.

Differential strengths of positive selection revealed by hitchhiking effects at small physical scales in Drosophila melanogaster,24361994,10.1093/molbev/mst270,"The long time scale of adaptive evolution makes it difficult to directly observe the spread of most beneficial mutations through natural populations. Therefore, inferring attributes of beneficial mutations by studying the genomic signals left by directional selection is an important component of population genetics research. One kind of signal is a trough in nearby neutral genetic variation due to selective fixation of initially rare alleles, a phenomenon known as ""genetic hitchhiking."" Accumulated evidence suggests that a considerable fraction of substitutions in the Drosophila genome results from positive selection, most of which are expected to have small selection coefficients and influence the population genetics of sites in the immediate vicinity. Using Drosophila melanogaster population genomic data, we found that the heterogeneity in synonymous polymorphism surrounding different categories of coding fixations is readily observable even within 25 bp of focal substitutions, which we interpret as the result of small-scale hitchhiking effects. The strength of natural selection on different sites appears to be quite heterogeneous. Particularly, neighboring fixations that changed amino acid polarities in a way that maintained the overall polarities of a protein were under stronger selection than other categories of fixations. Interestingly, we found that substitutions in slow-evolving genes are associated with stronger hitchhiking effects. This is consistent with the idea that adaptive evolution may involve few substitutions with large effects or many substitutions with small effects. Because our approach only weakly depends on the numbers of recent nonsynonymous substitutions, it can provide a complimentary view to the adaptive evolution inferred by other divergence-based evolutionary genetic methods.",2014,"Yuh Chwen G Lee, Charles H Langley, David J Begun, Yuh Chwen G Lee, Charles H Langley, David J Begun"
Only a Single Taxonomically Restricted Gene Family in the Drosophila melanogaster Subgroup Can Be Identified with High Confidence,32589737,10.1093/gbe/evaa127,"Taxonomically restricted genes (TRGs) are genes that are present only in one clade. Protein-coding TRGs may evolve de novo from previously noncoding sequences: functional ncRNA, introns, or alternative reading frames of older protein-coding genes, or intergenic sequences. A major challenge in studying de novo genes is the need to avoid both false-positives (nonfunctional open reading frames and/or functional genes that did not arise de novo) and false-negatives. Here, we search conservatively for high-confidence TRGs as the most promising candidates for experimental studies, ensuring functionality through conservation across at least two species, and ensuring de novo status through examination of homologous noncoding sequences. Our pipeline also avoids ascertainment biases associated with preconceptions of how de novo genes are born. We identify one TRG family that evolved de novo in the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. This TRG family contains single-copy genes in Drosophila simulans and Drosophila sechellia. It originated in an intron of a well-established gene, sharing that intron with another well-established gene upstream. These TRGs contain an intron that predates their open reading frame. These genes have not been previously reported as de novo originated, and to our knowledge, they are the best Drosophila candidates identified so far for experimental studies aimed at elucidating the properties of de novo genes.",2020,"Karina Zile, Christophe Dessimoz, Yannick Wurm, Joanna Masel, Karina Zile, Christophe Dessimoz, Yannick Wurm, Joanna Masel"
Quantitative Assessment of Eye Phenotypes for Functional Genetic Studies Using Drosophila melanogaster,26994292,10.1534/g3.116.027060,"About two-thirds of the vital genes in the Drosophila genome are involved in eye development, making the fly eye an excellent genetic system to study cellular function and development, neurodevelopment/degeneration, and complex diseases such as cancer and diabetes. We developed a novel computational method, implemented as Flynotyper software (http://flynotyper.sourceforge.net), to quantitatively assess the morphological defects in the Drosophila eye resulting from genetic alterations affecting basic cellular and developmental processes. Flynotyper utilizes a series of image processing operations to automatically detect the fly eye and the individual ommatidium, and calculates a phenotypic score as a measure of the disorderliness of ommatidial arrangement in the fly eye. As a proof of principle, we tested our method by analyzing the defects due to eye-specific knockdown of Drosophila orthologs of 12 neurodevelopmental genes to accurately document differential sensitivities of these genes to dosage alteration. We also evaluated eye images from six independent studies assessing the effect of overexpression of repeats, candidates from peptide library screens, and modifiers of neurotoxicity and developmental processes on eye morphology, and show strong concordance with the original assessment. We further demonstrate the utility of this method by analyzing 16 modifiers of sine oculis obtained from two genome-wide deficiency screens of Drosophila and accurately quantifying the effect of its enhancers and suppressors during eye development. Our method will complement existing assays for eye phenotypes, and increase the accuracy of studies that use fly eyes for functional evaluation of genes and genetic interactions.",2016,"Janani Iyer, Qingyu Wang, Thanh Le, Lucilla Pizzo, Sebastian Grönke, Surendra S Ambegaokar, Yuzuru Imai, Ashutosh Srivastava, Beatriz Llamusí Troisí, Graeme Mardon, Ruben Artero, George R Jackson, Adrian M Isaacs, Linda Partridge, Bingwei Lu, Justin P Kumar, Santhosh Girirajan, Janani Iyer, Qingyu Wang, Thanh Le, Lucilla Pizzo, Sebastian Grönke, Surendra S Ambegaokar, Yuzuru Imai, Ashutosh Srivastava, Beatriz Llamusí Troisí, Graeme Mardon, Ruben Artero, George R Jackson, Adrian M Isaacs, Linda Partridge, Bingwei Lu, Justin P Kumar, Santhosh Girirajan"
Optical calcium imaging in the nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster,22402253,10.1016/j.bbagen.2012.02.013,"Background:
      
    

    
      Drosophila melanogaster is one of the best-studied model organisms in biology, mainly because of the versatility of methods by which heredity and specific expression of genes can be traced and manipulated. Sophisticated genetic tools have been developed to express transgenes in selected cell types, and these techniques can be utilized to target DNA-encoded fluorescence probes to genetically defined subsets of neurons. Neuroscientists make use of this approach to monitor the activity of restricted types or subsets of neurons in the brain and the peripheral nervous system. Since membrane depolarization is typically accompanied by an increase in intracellular calcium ions, calcium-sensitive fluorescence proteins provide favorable tools to monitor the spatio-temporal activity across groups of neurons.
    

    
  


        Scope of review:
      
    

    
      Here we describe approaches to perform optical calcium imaging in Drosophila in consideration of various calcium sensors and expression systems. In addition, we outline by way of examples for which particular neuronal systems in Drosophila optical calcium imaging have been used. Finally, we exemplify briefly how optical calcium imaging in the brain of Drosophila can be carried out in practice.
    

    
  


        Major conclusions and general significance:
      
    

    
      Drosophila provides an excellent model organism to combine genetic expression systems with optical calcium imaging in order to investigate principles of sensory coding, neuronal plasticity, and processing of neuronal information underlying behavior.

The mushroom bodies of Drosophila melanogaster: an immunocytological and golgi study of Kenyon cell organization in the calyces and lobes,12966500,10.1002/jemt.10368,"Golgi impregnations reveal a variety of dendritic morphologies amongst Kenyon cells in the mushroom bodies of Drosophila melanogaster. Different morphological types of Kenyon cells contribute axon-like processes to five divisions of the medial and vertical lobes. Four of these divisions have characteristic affinities to antibodies raised against aspartate, glutamate, and taurine. A newly described posterior subdivision of the medial lobe, here named the betac lobe with its vertical branch alphac, comprises glutamatergic Kenyon cells that are probably homologous to glutamatergic Kenyon cells in the cockroach and honey bee, and are the last neurons to differentiate. The first neurons to differentiate, which supply the gamma lobe, are equipped with clawed dendritic specializations and are the structural homologues of clawed class II Kenyon cells supplying the gamma lobes in cockroaches and honey bees. Three intermediate divisions lie between the betac lobe and gamma lobe. These are, from the back towards the front, the beta lobe, the beta' lobe, and a narrow division between beta' and gamma called the beta"" lobe. The fused calyx of the Drosophila mushroom body is comparable to the double calyces of Hymenoptera, here exemplified by a basal taxon, Diprion pini. Further similarities between the hymenopteran calyces and those of Drosophila are suggested by the segregation of different types of Kenyon cell dendrites within the calyx neuropil. The organization of afferents from the antennal lobes also defines regions in the Drosophila calyx that may be homologous to the lip and basal ring regions of the honey bee calyces. As in honey bees, GABAergic processes densely invade Drosophila's calyces, which also contain a sparse but uniform distribution of octopaminergic elements. Microsc. Res.

Functional characterization and expression analysis of members of the UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase family from Drosophila melanogaster,12829714,10.1074/jbc.M303836200,"Here we report the cloning and functional characterization of eight members of the UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase gene family from Drosophila melanogaster (polypeptide GalNAc transferase = pgant1-8). Full-length cDNAs were isolated from a Drosophila embryonic library based on homology to known ppGaNTases. Alignments with characterized mammalian isoforms revealed strong sequence similarities between certain fly and mammalian isoforms, highlighting putative orthologues between the species. In vitro activity assays demonstrated biochemical transferase activity for each gene, with three isoforms requiring glycosylated substrates. Comparison of the activities of Drosophila and mammalian orthologues revealed conservation of substrate preferences against a panel of peptide and glycopeptide substrates. Furthermore, Edman degradation analysis demonstrated that preferred sites of GalNac addition were also conserved between certain fly and mammalian orthologues. Semi-quantitative PCR amplification of Drosophila cDNA revealed expression of most isoforms at each developmental stage, with some isoforms being less abundant at certain stages relative to others. In situ hybridization to Drosophila embryos revealed specific staining of pgant5 and pgant6 in the salivary glands and pgant5 in the developing hindgut. Additionally, pgant5 and pgant6 expression within the egg chamber was restricted to the follicle cells, cells known to be involved in egg formation and subsequent embryonic patterning. The characterization reported here provides additional insight into the use of this model system to dissect the biological role of this enzyme family in vivo during both fly and mammalian development.",2003,"Kelly G Ten Hagen, Duy T Tran, Thomas A Gerken, David S Stein, Zhenyu Zhang, Kelly G Ten Hagen, Duy T Tran, Thomas A Gerken, David S Stein, Zhenyu Zhang"

Multiple genetic loci affect place learning and memory performance in Drosophila melanogaster,31095869,10.1111/gbb.12581,"Learning and memory are critical functions for all animals, giving individuals the ability to respond to changes in their environment. Within populations, individuals vary, however the mechanisms underlying this variation in performance are largely unknown. Thus, it remains to be determined what genetic factors cause an individual to have high learning ability and what factors determine how well an individual will remember what they have learned. To genetically dissect learning and memory performance, we used the Drosophila synthetic population resource (DSPR), a multiparent mapping resource in the model system Drosophila melanogaster, consisting of a large set of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) that naturally vary in these and other traits. Fruit flies can be trained in a ""heat box"" to learn to remain on one side of a chamber (place learning) and can remember this (place memory) over short timescales. Using this paradigm, we measured place learning and memory for ~49 000 individual flies from over 700 DSPR RILs. We identified 16 different loci across the genome that significantly affect place learning and/or memory performance, with 5 of these loci affecting both traits. To identify transcriptomic differences associated with performance, we performed RNA-Seq on pooled samples of seven high performing and seven low performing RILs for both learning and memory and identified hundreds of genes with differences in expression in the two sets. Integrating our transcriptomic results with the mapping results allowed us to identify nine promising candidate genes, advancing our understanding of the genetic basis underlying natural variation in learning and memory performance.",2019,"Patricka A Williams-Simon, Christopher Posey, Samuel Mitchell, Enoch Ng'oma, James A Mrkvicka, Troy Zars, Elizabeth G King, Patricka A Williams-Simon, Christopher Posey, Samuel Mitchell, Enoch Ng'oma, James A Mrkvicka, Troy Zars, Elizabeth G King"
Binucleation of Accessory Gland Lobe Contributes to Effective Ejection of Seminal Fluid in Drosophila melanogaster,30298781,10.2108/zs170188,"The adult male accessory gland in insects is an internal reproductive organ analogous to the mammalian prostate, and secretes various components in the seminal fluid. Products of the accessory gland in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster are known to control reproductive behaviors in mated females, such as food uptake, oviposition rate, and rejection of re-mating with other males, all of which increase male reproductive capacity. Production of larger amounts of accessory gland products is thus thought to result in higher male reproductive success. The epithelium of the Drosophila accessory gland lobe is composed of a unique population of binucleate cells. We previously predicted, based on measurements of cell size in mono/binucleate mosaic accessory glands, that binucleation results in a higher plasticity in cell shape, enabling more effective ejection of seminal fluid. However, the actual effect of binucleation on ejection of seminal fluid or reproductive capacity remained unclear, as we were unable to generate an organ with uniformly mononucleate cells. In the present study, we generated organs in which most of the epithelial cells are mononucleate by manipulating aurora B or fizzy-related to block binucleation. Mononucleation resulted in a less elastic accessory gland lobe, which decreased ejection volume and the oviposition of mated females; these effects were particularly pronounced over the long term. These results suggest that binucleation in accessory gland epithelial cells contributes to higher plasticity in the volume of this organ, and enhances male reproductive success through enabling ejection of larger amounts of seminal fluid.",2018,"Kiichiro Taniguchi, Akihiko Kokuryo, Takao Imano, Hideki Nakagoshi, Takashi Adachi-Yamada, Kiichiro Taniguchi, Akihiko Kokuryo, Takao Imano, Hideki Nakagoshi, Takashi Adachi-Yamada"
R1 retrotransposons in the nucleolar organizers of Drosophila melanogaster are transcribed by RNA polymerase I upon heat shock,30063880,10.1080/21541264.2018.1506682,"The ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) of Drosophila melanogaster reside within centromere-proximal nucleolar organizers on both the X and Y chromosomes. Each locus contains between 200-300 tandem repeat rDNA units that encode 18S, 5.8S, 2S, and 28S ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) necessary for ribosome biogenesis. In arthropods like Drosophila, about 60% of the rDNA genes have R1 and/or R2 retrotransposons inserted at specific sites within their 28S regions; these units likely fail to produce functional 28S rRNA. We showed earlier that R2 expression increases upon nucleolar stress caused by the loss of the ribosome assembly factor, Nucleolar Phosphoprotein of 140 kDa (Nopp140). Here we show that R1 expression is selectively induced by heat shock. Actinomycin D, but not α-amanitin, blocked R1 expression in S2 cells upon heat shock, indicating that R1 elements are transcribed by Pol I. A series of RT-PCRs established read-through transcription by Pol I from the 28S gene region into R1. Sequencing the RT-PCR products confirmed the 28S-R1 RNA junction and the expression of R1 elements within nucleolar rDNA rather than R1 elements known to reside in centromeric heterochromatin. Using a genome-wide precision run-on sequencing (PRO-seq) data set available at NCBI-GEO, we show that Pol I activity on R1 elements is negligible under normal non-heat shock conditions but increases upon heat shock. We propose that prior to heat shock Pol I pauses within the 5' end of R1 where we find a consensus ""pause button"", and that heat shock releases Pol I for read-through transcription farther into R1.",2018,"Himanshu S Raje, Molly E Lieux, Patrick J DiMario, Himanshu S Raje, Molly E Lieux, Patrick J DiMario"
Genetic architecture of natural variation in Drosophila melanogaster aggressive behavior,26100892,10.1073/pnas.1510104112,"Aggression is an evolutionarily conserved complex behavior essential for survival and the organization of social hierarchies. With the exception of genetic variants associated with bioamine signaling, which have been implicated in aggression in many species, the genetic basis of natural variation in aggression is largely unknown. Drosophila melanogaster is a favorable model system for exploring the genetic basis of natural variation in aggression. Here, we performed genome-wide association analyses using the inbred, sequenced lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and replicate advanced intercross populations derived from the most and least aggressive DGRP lines. We identified genes that have been previously implicated in aggressive behavior as well as many novel loci, including gustatory receptor 63a (Gr63a), which encodes a subunit of the receptor for CO2, and genes associated with development and function of the nervous system. Although genes from the two association analyses were largely nonoverlapping, they mapped onto a genetic interaction network inferred from an analysis of pairwise epistasis in the DGRP. We used mutations and RNAi knock-down alleles to functionally validate 79% of the candidate genes and 75% of the candidate epistatic interactions tested. Epistasis for aggressive behavior causes cryptic genetic variation in the DGRP that is revealed by changing allele frequencies in the outbred populations derived from extreme DGRP lines.

Digital in vivo 3D atlas of the antennal lobe of Drosophila melanogaster,25327641,10.1002/cne.23697,"As a model for primary olfactory perception, the antennal lobe (AL) of Drosophila melanogaster is among the most thoroughly investigated and well-understood neuronal structures. Most studies investigating the functional properties and neuronal wiring of the AL are conducted in vivo, although so far the AL morphology has been mainly analyzed in vitro. Identifying the morphological subunits of the AL-the olfactory glomeruli-is usually done using in vitro AL atlases. However, the dissection and fixation procedure causes not only strong volumetric but also geometrical modifications; the result is unpredictable dislocation and a distortion of the AL glomeruli between the in vitro and in vivo brains. Hence, to characterize these artifacts, which are caused by in vitro processing, and to reliably identify glomeruli for in vivo applications, we generated a transgenic fly that expresses the red fluorescent protein DsRed directly fused to the presynaptic protein n-synaptobrevin, under the control of the pan-neuronal promotor elav to label the neuropil in the live animal. Using this fly line, we generated a digital 3D atlas of the live Drosophila AL; this atlas, the first of its kind, provides an excellent geometric match for in vivo studies. We verified the identity of 63% of AL glomeruli by mapping the projections of 34 GAL4-lines of individual chemosensory receptor genes.

An inverse PCR screen for the detection of P element insertions in cloned genomic intervals in Drosophila melanogaster,7713430,,"We developed a screening approach that utilizes an inverse polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect P element insertions in or near previously cloned genes in Drosophila melanogaster. We used this approach in a large scale genetic screen in which P elements were mobilized from sites on the X chromosome to new autosomal locations. Mutagenized flies were combined in pools, and our screening approach was used to generate probes corresponding to the sequences flanking each site of insertion. These probes then were used for hybridization to cloned genomic intervals, allowing individuals carrying insertions in them to be detected. We used the same approach to perform repeated rounds of sib-selection to generate stable insertion lines. We screened 16,100 insert bearing individuals and recovered 11 insertions in five intervals containing genes encoding members of the kinesin superfamily in Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, we recovered an insertion in the region including the Larval Serum Protein-2 gene. Examination by Southern hybridization confirms that the lines we recovered represent genuine insertions in the corresponding genomic intervals. Our data indicates that this approach will be very efficient both for P element mutagenesis of new genomic regions and for detection and recovery of ""local"" P element transposition events. In addition, our data constitutes a survey of preferred P element insertion sites in the Drosophila genome and suggests that insertion sites that are mutable at a rate of approximately 10(-4) are distributed every 40-50 kb.",1995,"B Dalby, A J Pereira, L S Goldstein, B Dalby, A J Pereira, L S Goldstein"
Genes controlling malathion resistance in a laboratory-selected population of Drosophila melanogaster,3148489,10.1139/g88-136,"The chromosomal locations of several genes responsible for increased malathion resistance in a laboratory-selected population of Drosophila melanogaster have been determined. These genes appear to be involved in the regulation of microsomal cytochrome P-450. A major gene on chromosome 2 (2-64) and at least two genes on chromosome 3 (near 3-58) control increased mixed function oxidase activity, and both larval and adult malathion resistance. Although the chromosome 2 locus was not associated with a significant increase in cytochrome P-450 content, SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of microsomal proteins detected increased silver staining of a polypeptide having a relative molecular mass (Mr) of about 52,000. Microsomes from strains carrying the chromosome 3 factors for resistance contained more cytochrome P-450 and increased amounts of two heme-staining protein bands (Mr = 50,000 and 54,000). The genes regulating these proteins were closely linked to striped at 3-62 and probably identical to the loci responsible for malathion resistance and increased mixed function oxidase activity.

Formation of fibers relies on DED (Death-effector domain) domain of dFADD, since DED domain-deleted mutant existed as a monomer. Dual luciferase reporter assay showed that intact DED domain was required for the induction of downstream antimicrobial peptides, indicating that fiber formation was the key to IMD signal transduction.

The cardiotoxic action of PcE was also examined in a model of semi-isolated cockroach heart. The administration of PcE (2 mg/ml) to flies for 24 h resulted in a marked increase in mortality rate (7.6-fold rise compared to control).

Mushroom body miscellanea: transgenic Drosophila strains expressing anatomical and physiological sensor proteins in Kenyon cells,24065891,10.3389/fncir.2013.00147,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represents a key model organism for analyzing how neuronal circuits regulate behavior. The mushroom body in the central brain is a particularly prominent brain region that has been intensely studied in several insect species and been implicated in a variety of behaviors, e.g., associative learning, locomotor activity, and sleep. Drosophila melanogaster offers the advantage that transgenes can be easily expressed in neuronal subpopulations, e.g., in intrinsic mushroom body neurons (Kenyon cells). A number of transgenes has been described and engineered to visualize the anatomy of neurons, to monitor physiological parameters of neuronal activity, and to manipulate neuronal function artificially. To target the expression of these transgenes selectively to specific neurons several sophisticated bi- or even multipartite transcription systems have been invented. However, the number of transgenes that can be combined in the genome of an individual fly is limited in practice. To facilitate the analysis of the mushroom body we provide a compilation of transgenic fruit flies that express transgenes under direct control of the Kenyon-cell specific promoter, mb247. The transgenes expressed are fluorescence reporters to analyze neuroanatomical aspects of the mushroom body, proteins to restrict ectopic gene expression to mushroom bodies, or fluorescent sensors to monitor physiological parameters of neuronal activity of Kenyon cells.

We have examined by autoradiography the patterns of 3H-thymidine incorporation during 10 min or 1 min pulses in salivary gland polytene chromosomes of older giant larvae and of wild type late third instar larvae of D. melanogaster grown since hatching either at 24 degrees C or at 10 degrees C. The various patterns of labelling and their relative frequencies are generally similar in glands from the warm- (24 degrees C) or cold (10 degrees C)-reared wild type larvae, except the interband (IB) labelling patterns which are very frequent in the later group but rare in the former. The IB type labelled nuclei in cold-reared wild type larvae show labelling ranging from only a few puffs/interbands labelled to nearly all puffs/interbands labelled. In warm-reared wild type larvae, very low labelled IB patterns are not seen. In older giant larvae, the 3H-thymidine labelling patterns are in most respects similar to those seen in cold-reared wild type larvae. In 1 min pulsed preparations from all larvae, the IB patterns are relatively more frequent than in corresponding 10 min pulsed preparations. No nuclei with the continuous (2C or 3C) type of labelling pattern, with all bands and interbands/puffs labelled, were seen in 1 min pulsed preparations from cold-reared wild type or in giant larvae, and only a few nuclei in 1 min pulsed preparations from warm-reared wild type larvae exhibited the 2C labelling pattern. Analysis of silver grain density on specific late replicating sites in late discontinuous (ID) type labelled nuclei suggests that the rate of DNA synthesis per chromosomal site is not different at the two developmental temperatures. It is suggested that correlated with the prolongation of larval life under cold-rearing conditions or in giant larvae, the polytene replication cycles are also prolonged. It is further suggested that the polytene S-period in these larvae is longer de to a considerable asynchrony in the initiation and termination of replication of different sites during a replication cycle.",1982,"A Mishra, S C Lakhotia, A Mishra, S C Lakhotia"
OpenFlyData: an exemplar data web integrating gene expression data on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,20382263,10.1016/j.jbi.2010.04.004,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Integrating heterogeneous data across distributed sources is a major requirement for in silico bioinformatics supporting translational research. For example, genome-scale data on patterns of gene expression in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster are widely used in functional genomic studies in many organisms to inform candidate gene selection and validate experimental results. However, current data integration solutions tend to be heavy weight, and require significant initial and ongoing investment of effort. Development of a common Web-based data integration infrastructure (a.k.a. data web), using Semantic Web standards, promises to alleviate these difficulties, but little is known about the feasibility, costs, risks or practical means of migrating to such an infrastructure.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We describe the development of OpenFlyData, a proof-of-concept system integrating gene expression data on D. melanogaster, combining Semantic Web standards with light-weight approaches to Web programming based on Web 2.0 design patterns. To support researchers designing and validating functional genomic studies, OpenFlyData includes user-facing search applications providing intuitive access to and comparison of gene expression data from FlyAtlas, the BDGP in situ database, and FlyTED, using data from FlyBase to expand and disambiguate gene names. OpenFlyData's services are also openly accessible, and are available for reuse by other bioinformaticians and application developers. Semi-automated methods and tools were developed to support labour- and knowledge-intensive tasks involved in deploying SPARQL services. These include methods for generating ontologies and relational-to-RDF mappings for relational databases, which we illustrate using the FlyBase Chado database schema; and methods for mapping gene identifiers between databases. The advantages of using Semantic Web standards for biomedical data integration are discussed, as are open issues. In particular, although the performance of open source SPARQL implementations is sufficient to query gene expression data directly from user-facing applications such as Web-based data fusions (a.k.a. mashups), we found open SPARQL endpoints to be vulnerable to denial-of-service-type problems, which must be mitigated to ensure reliability of services based on this standard. These results are relevant to data integration activities in translational bioinformatics.

Isolation and characterization of recombinant DNA plasmids carrying Drosophila tRNA genes,118082,10.1016/0378-1119(79)90046-5,"Recombinant plasmids carrying Drosophila melanogaster tRNA genes were constructed by ligation of HindIII-cleaved Drosophila DNA to HindIII cut pBR322 DNA. 90 clones were isolated that contained genes for one or more of eleven tRNAs. 43 of the plasmids were characterized by a number of methods: restriction nuclease digestion; agarose gel electrophoresis; hybridization with individual, purified, 125I-labelled Drosophila tRNA molecules and in situ hybridization to Drosophila chromosomes. The results show that several different tRNA genes have been isolated which code for single, specific isoacceptors. The DNAs from 8 plasmids each hybridize to single sites on Drosophila polytene chromosomes. In addition, the data show examples of two different plasmids hybridizing to different loci coding for the same tRNA; this means that we have isolated representatives of tRNA genes which map at widely separated points on the Drosophila genome.",1979,"R Dunn, A D Delaney, I C Gillam, S Hayashi, G M Tener, T Grigliatti, V Misra, M G Spurr, D M Taylor, R C Miller Jr, R Dunn, A D Delaney, I C Gillam, S Hayashi, G M Tener, T Grigliatti, V Misra, M G Spurr, D M Taylor, R C Miller Jr"
Multi-unit recording with iridium oxide modified stereotrodes in Drosophila melanogaster,24286699,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2013.11.013,"Background:
      
    

    
      Drosophila is a very favorable animal model for the studies of neuroscience. However, it remains a great challenge to employ electrophysiological approaches in Drosophila to study the neuronal assembly dynamics in vivo, partially due to the small size of the Drosophila brain. Small and sensitive microelectrodes for multi-unit recordings are greatly desired.
    

    
  


        New method:
      
    

    
      We fabricated micro-scale stereotrodes for electrical recordings in Drosophila melanogaster. The stereotrodes were modified with iridium oxide (IrO2) under a highly controllable deposition procedure to improve their electrochemical properties. Electrical recordings were carried out using the IrO2 stereotrodes to detect spontaneous action potentials and LFPs in vivo.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The IrO2 electrodes exhibited significantly higher capacitance and lower impedance at 1 kHz. Electrical recording with the IrO2 stereotrodes in vivo demonstrated an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 7.3 and a significantly improved LFP sensitivity. 5 types of different neurons recorded were clearly separated. Electrophysiological responses to visual and odor stimulation were also detected, respectively.
    

    
  


        Comparison with existing method(s):
      
    

    
      The most widely used electrodes for electrical recording in Drosophila are glass microelectrode and sharpened tungsten microelectrode, which are typically used for single-unit recordings. Although tetrode technology has been used to record multi-neuronal activities from Drosophila, the fabricated IrO2 stereotrodes possess smaller geometry size but exhibited comparable recording signal-to noise ration and better sorting quality.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The IrO2 stereotrodes are capable to meet the requirements of multi-unit recording and spike sorting, which will be a useful tool for the electrophysiology-based researches especially in Drosophila and other small animals.",2014,"Cheng Zhong, Yuanyuan Zhang, Wei He, Pengfei Wei, Yi Lu, Yan Zhu, Li Liu, Liping Wang, Cheng Zhong, Yuanyuan Zhang, Wei He, Pengfei Wei, Yi Lu, Yan Zhu, Li Liu, Liping Wang"
Changes in Drosophila melanogaster Sleep-Wake Behavior Due to Lotus ( Nelumbo nucifera) Seed and Hwang Jeong ( Polygonatum sibiricum) Extracts,29333381,10.3746/pnf.2017.22.4.293,"We evaluated the sleep enhancement activity of the medicinal herbs valerian (Valeriana officinalis), jujube (Ziziphus jujube), lotus seed (Nelumbo nucifera), Gastrodia elata, Polygonatum sibiricum, and baekbokryung (Poria cocos), which can relieve insomnia in a Drosophila model. Locomotor activity was measured in the Drosophila model to evaluate the sleep activity of Korean medicinal herbs traditionally used as sleep aids. The group treated with lotus seed extract showed less nocturnal activity. Treatment with 10 or 20 mg/mL of P. sibiricum significantly reduced nocturnal activity compared to the control group (P<0.05). The activity and sleep bouts of fruit flies were significantly decreased by a high-dose treatment (10 mg/mL) of lotus or P. sibiricum extracts at night. Caffeine-treated Drosophila showed increased nocturnal activity and decreased total sleep time (P<0.05). Flies receiving the 10 mg-doses of lotus seed or P. sibiricum extract showed significantly different nocturnal locomotor activity and total sleep time compared to caffeine-treated Drosophila.

Low-resolution structure of Drosophila translin,23650579,10.1016/j.fob.2012.03.001,"Crystals of native Drosophila melanogaster translin diffracted to 7 Å resolution. Reductive methylation of the protein improved crystal quality. The native and methylated proteins showed similar profiles in size-exclusion chromatography analyses but the methylated protein displayed reduced DNA-binding activity. Crystals of the methylated protein diffracted to 4.2 Å resolution at BM14 of the ESRF synchrotron. Crystals with 49% solvent content belonged to monoclinic space group P21 with eight protomers in the asymmetric unit. Only 2% of low-resolution structures with similar low percentage solvent content were found in the PDB. The crystal structure, solved by molecular replacement method, refined to R work (R free) of 0.24 (0.29) with excellent stereochemistry. The crystal structure clearly shows that drosophila protein exists as an octamer, and not as a decamer as expected from gel-filtration elution profiles. The similar octameric quaternary fold in translin orthologs and in translin-TRAX complexes suggests an up-down dimer as the basic structural subunit of translin-like proteins. The drosophila oligomer displays asymmetric assembly and increased radius of gyration that accounts for the observed differences between the elution profiles of human and drosophila proteins on gel-filtration columns. This study demonstrates clearly that low-resolution X-ray structure can be useful in understanding complex biological oligomers.",2012,"Vinay Kumar, Gagan D Gupta, Vinay Kumar, Gagan D Gupta"
A putative digestive cysteine proteinase from Drosophila melanogaster is predominantly expressed in the embryonic and larval midgut,7851441,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.tb20428.x,"Plant seeds have biodefense systems for protection against insects. One of these systems may be based on the occurrence of phytocystatins, cysteine proteinase inhibitors of plant origin, that probably inhibit insect cysteine proteinases involved in digestive functions. To elucidate a molecular mechanism for this biodefense phenomenon, we isolated a gene encoding a putative digestive cysteine proteinase from Drosophila melanogaster, a suitable model species. The cloned genomic DNA fragment contained a sequence encoding a cysteine proteinase. The mature enzyme from the encoded protein, termed Drosophila cysteine proteinase-1, consisted of 218 amino acid residues. Drosophila cysteine proteinase-1 showed 67% similarity in its amino acid sequence to a lobster cysteine proteinase-3 contained in the digestive juice. This enzyme also showed significant similarities to cysteine proteinases of animal origin such as cathepsins H and L, and to proteinases of plant origin such as rice oryzains alpha and beta. In situ hybridization studies for the embryo showed that the mRNA for Drosophila cysteine proteinase-1 was predominantly expressed in the midgut. Larval alimentary organs, such as the salivary gland and the midgut including the gastric caeca, also expressed the mRNA at significant levels. These observations, suggesting that Drosophila cysteine proteinase-1 is a digestive cysteine proteinase which can be used as a model target of phytocystatins, will hopefully lead to new strategies for the regulation of pest insects.",1995,"I Matsumoto, H Watanabe, K Abe, S Arai, Y Emori, I Matsumoto, H Watanabe, K Abe, S Arai, Y Emori"
Molecular characterization and expression of the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase alpha-subunit in Drosophila melanogaster,2540956,,"The (Na+ + K+)-ATPase (sodium pump) is an ouabain-sensitive, electrogenic ion pump responsible for maintaining the balance of sodium and potassium ions in almost all animal cells. Robust, ouabain-sensitive rubidium uptake, indicative of the sodium pump, was found in tissue-cultured Drosophila cells, and both larvae and adults die when fed a diet containing ouabain. A monoclonal antibody to the avian sodium pump alpha-subunit was found to cross-react with the Drosophila sodium pump alpha-subunit. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to obtain a semi-quantitative view of the expression of the sodium pump in Drosophila tissues: high levels of the sodium pump were detected in malpighian tubules, indirect flight muscles and tubular muscles, and throughout the nervous system. The cDNA encoding this sodium pump alpha-subunit in Drosophila melanogaster was cloned, sequenced and expressed in mouse L cells. At the amino acid level, its deduced sequence of 1038 residues (the first such sequence for an invertebrate) is approximately 80% similar to alpha-subunit sequences reported for vertebrates. Only one gene was found in Drosophila, located on the third chromosome at position 93B.

Saxitoxin binding to sodium channels in head extracts from wild-type and tetrodotoxin-sensitive strains of Drosophila melanogaster,6766315,10.1016/0005-2736(80)90091-7,"Extracts prepared from heads of Drosophila melanogaster show high-affinity binding (KD = 1.9 nM) of [3H]saxitonin, a compound known to bind to and block voltage-sensitive sodium channels in other organisms. The interaction between saxitoxin and the Drosophila saxitoxin receptor is non-cooperative and reversible with a half-life of 18.3 s for binding at 4 degrees C. The saturable binding is specifically inhibited by tetrodotoxin with a K1 = 0.30 nM. The number of saturable binding sites in the extract is 97 fmol/mg protein. Since approx. 50% of the binding activity is recovered in the extract, the number of binding sites in the head is estimated to be 6.4 fmol/mg head. Nerve conduction in Drosophila larvae is completely blocked after 20 min in a bathing solution containing 200 nM tetrodotoxin. A comparison between the binding and the electrophysiological studies in Drosophila and other organisms suggests that the Drosophila saxitoxin receptor is part of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel involved in the propagation of action potentials. A mutant (ttxs), which is abnormally sensitive to dietary tetrodotoxin, is shown to be indistinguishable from wild type with respect to [3H]saxitonin-binding properties and physiological sensitivity to tetrodotoxin. These studies provide techniques which can be used to identify mutants with defects in the saxitoxin-binding component of the sodium channel.",1980,"J Gitschier, G R Strichartz, L M Hall, J Gitschier, G R Strichartz, L M Hall"

The proportion of amphiphilic choline acetyltransferase in Drosophila melanogaster is higher than in rat or Torpedo and is developmentally regulated,8508306,10.1016/0006-8993(93)90876-o,"We show that in the central nervous system of the fly, Drosophila melanogaster, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity exists under two molecular forms, a soluble, hydrophilic form and a membrane-bound, amphiphilic form. This is based on the following demonstrations of differential solubilization and interaction with non-denaturing detergents: sequential extraction of Drosophila heads produced low-salt-soluble (83-87%) and detergent-soluble (6-7%) ChAT activity. Sedimentation in sucrose gradients of detergent-soluble ChAT was found to be influenced by the type of detergent present in the gradient (Triton X-100 and Brij 96). This was not the case for low-salt-soluble ChAT. To further confirm these findings, we subjected Drosophila heads to Triton X-114 fractionation. This method, which yielded 12% of amphiphilic ChAT activity, separates hydrophilic from amphiphilic proteins. Compared to central nervous tissue of rat and Torpedo electric lobes, Drosophila head contained the highest proportion of amphiphilic ChAT activity. Synaptosomes isolated from Torpedo electric organ exhibited higher levels of amphiphilic ChAT than did electric lobes. Of the three animal species analyzed here, the Torpedo amphiphilic enzyme was the most hydrophobic and the rat enzyme the least hydrophobic.

[COMPARATIVE STUDY OF Hrs AND OTHER ENDOSOMAL MARKERS CELLULAR LOCALIZATION IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER SPERMATOGENESIS BY GFP-CHIMERICAL PROTEIN APPROACH],26591063,,"Acrosome is a special organelle in spermatozoids necessary for fertilizing oocyte and originates, according to various theories, either from Golgi apparatus, or from endosomes and lysosomes. One of the proteins, found at mammalian acrosome, is Hgs, a homologue of Drosophila melanogaster Hrs (Hepatocyte growth factor regulated tyrosine kinase substrate), a known marker of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). However, although Drosophila acrosome was extensively studied, it is yet unknown whether Hrs localizes at acrosome similar to Hgs and, more generally, whether the spectrum of acrosomal proteins in Drosophila is the same as in mammals. Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) is the multidomain vesicular protein participating in the endosome-lysosome protein sorting. We demonstrated that two protein variants of the Drosophila Hrs are expressed in testes: a longer isoform B, and a shorter isoform A, which lacks VHS and FYVE domains that are necessary for anchoring Hrs in endosomes. We found that Hrs isoform B is concentrated at fusoma of spermatocytes in contrast to mammalian Hrs. This localization requires the C-terminus of the protein, starting from the aminoacid residue 383. In situ hybridization of hrs RNA probe showed that the gene is expressed early in spermatogenesis consistently with Hrs localization in early fusoma.

Therefore, the study presented here was conceived to depict the role of altered metabolism in PQ-induced Parkinson-like symptoms and to explore Drosophila as a potential model organism for such studies. Metabolic profile was generated in control and in flies that were fed PQ (5, 10, and 20 mM) in the diet for 12 and 24 h concurrent with assessment of indices of oxidative stress, dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and behavioral alteration. PQ was found to significantly alter 24 metabolites belonging to different biological pathways along with significant alterations in the above indices. In addition, PQ attenuated brain dopamine content in the exposed organism. The study demonstrates that PQ-induced alteration in the metabolites leads to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration in the exposed organism along with movement disorder, a phenotype typical of Parkinson-like symptoms. The study is relevant in the context of Drosophila and humans because similar alteration in the metabolic pathways has been observed in both PQ-exposed Drosophila and in postmortem samples of patients with Parkinsonism. Furthermore, this study provides advocacy towards the applicability of Drosophila as an alternate model organism for pre-screening of environmental chemicals for their neurodegenerative potential with altered metabolism.",2016,"Arvind Kumar Shukla, Ch Ratnasekhar, Prakash Pragya, Hitesh Singh Chaouhan, Devendra Kumar Patel, Debapratim Kar Chowdhuri, Mohana Krishna Reddy Mudiam, Arvind Kumar Shukla, Ch Ratnasekhar, Prakash Pragya, Hitesh Singh Chaouhan, Devendra Kumar Patel, Debapratim Kar Chowdhuri, Mohana Krishna Reddy Mudiam"
Do males matter? Testing the effects of male genetic background on female meiotic crossover rates in Drosophila melanogaster,24889512,10.1111/evo.12455,"Meiotic recombination is a critical genetic process as well as a pivotal evolutionary force. Rates of crossing over are highly variable within and between species, due to both genetic and environmental factors. Early studies in Drosophila implicated female genetic background as a major determinant of crossover rate and recent work has highlighted male genetic background as a possible mediator as well. Our study employed classical genetics to address how female and male genetic backgrounds individually and jointly affect crossover rates. We measured rates of crossing over in a 33 cM region of the Drosophila melanogaster X chromosome using a two-step crossing scheme exploiting visible markers. In total, we measured crossover rates of 10 inbred lines in a full diallel cross. Our experimental design facilitates measuring the contributions of female genetic background, male genetic background, and female by male genetic background interaction effects on rates of crossing over in females. Our results indicate that although female genetic background significantly affects female meiotic crossover rates in Drosophila, male genetic background and the interaction of female and male genetic backgrounds have no significant effect. These findings thus suggest that male-mediated effects are unlikely to contribute greatly to variation in recombination rates in natural populations of Drosophila.",2014,"Chad M Hunter, Nadia D Singh, Chad M Hunter, Nadia D Singh"
Interspecies interactions determine the impact of the gut microbiota on nutrient allocation in Drosophila melanogaster,24242251,10.1128/AEM.02742-13,"The animal gut is perpetually exposed to microorganisms, and this microbiota affects development, nutrient allocation, and immune homeostasis. A major challenge is to understand the contribution of individual microbial species and interactions among species in shaping these microbe-dependent traits. Using the Drosophila melanogaster gut microbiota, we tested whether microbe-dependent performance and nutritional traits of Drosophila are functionally modular, i.e., whether the impact of each microbial taxon on host traits is independent of the presence of other microbial taxa. Gnotobiotic flies were constructed with one or a set of five of the Acetobacter and Lactobacillus species which dominate the gut microbiota of conventional flies (Drosophila with untreated microbiota). Axenic (microbiota-free) flies exhibited prolonged development time and elevated glucose and triglyceride contents. The low glucose content of conventional flies was recapitulated in gnotobiotic Drosophila flies colonized with any of the 5 bacterial taxa tested. In contrast, the development rates and triglyceride levels in monocolonized flies varied depending on the taxon present: Acetobacter species supported the largest reductions, while most Lactobacillus species had no effect. Only flies with both Acetobacter and Lactobacillus had triglyceride contents restored to the level in conventional flies. This could be attributed to two processes: Lactobacillus-mediated promotion of Acetobacter abundance in the fly and a significant negative correlation between fly triglyceride content and Acetobacter abundance. We conclude that the microbial basis of host traits varies in both specificity and modularity; microbe-mediated reduction in glucose is relatively nonspecific and modular, while triglyceride content is influenced by interactions among microbes.",2014,"Peter D Newell, Angela E Douglas, Peter D Newell, Angela E Douglas"
Noninvasive analysis of microbiome dynamics in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,24014528,10.1128/AEM.01903-13,"The diversity and structure of the intestinal microbial community has a strong influence on life history. To understand how hosts and microbes interact, model organisms with comparatively simple microbial communities, such as the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), offer key advantages. However, studies of the Drosophila microbiome are limited to a single point in time, because flies are typically sacrificed for DNA extraction. In order to test whether noninvasive approaches, such as sampling of fly feces, could be a means to assess fly-associated communities over time on the same cohort of flies, we compared the microbial communities of fly feces, dissected fly intestines, and whole flies across three different Drosophila strains. Bacterial species identified in either whole flies or isolated intestines were reproducibly found in feces samples. Although the bacterial communities of feces and intestinal samples were not identical, they shared similarities and obviously the same origin. In contrast to material from whole flies and intestines, feces samples were not compromised by Wolbachia spp. infections, which are widespread in laboratory and wild strains. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we showed that simple nutritional interventions, such as a high-fat diet or short-term starvation, had drastic and long-lasting effects on the micobiome. Thus, the analysis of feces can supplement the toolbox for microbiome studies in Drosophila, unleashing the full potential of such studies in time course experiments where multiple samples from single populations are obtained during aging, development, or experimental manipulations.",2013,"Christine Fink, Fabian Staubach, Sven Kuenzel, John F Baines, Thomas Roeder, Christine Fink, Fabian Staubach, Sven Kuenzel, John F Baines, Thomas Roeder"
Loss of the tumor suppressor Pten promotes proliferation of Drosophila melanogaster cells in vitro and gives rise to continuous cell lines,22363644,10.1371/journal.pone.0031417,"In vivo analysis of Drosophila melanogaster has enhanced our understanding of many biological processes, notably the mechanisms of heredity and development. While in vivo analysis of mutants has been a strength of the field, analyzing fly cells in culture is valuable for cell biological, biochemical and whole genome approaches in which large numbers of homogeneous cells are required. An efficient genetic method to derive Drosophila cell lines using expression of an oncogenic form of Ras (Ras(V12)) has been developed. Mutations in tumor suppressors, which are known to cause cell hyperproliferation in vivo, could provide another method for generating Drosophila cell lines. Here we screened Drosophila tumor suppressor mutations to test if they promoted cell proliferation in vitro. We generated primary cultures and determined when patches of proliferating cells first emerged. These cells emerged on average at 37 days in wild-type cultures. Using this assay we found that a Pten mutation had a strong effect. Patches of proliferating cells appeared on average at 11 days and the cultures became confluent in about 3 weeks, which is similar to the timeframe for cultures expressing Ras(V12). Three Pten mutant cell lines were generated and these have now been cultured for between 250 and 630 cell doublings suggesting the life of the mutant cells is likely to be indefinite. We conclude that the use of Pten mutants is a powerful means to derive new Drosophila cell lines.",2012,"Steven E Justiniano, Anne Mathew, Sayan Mitra, Sathiya N Manivannan, Amanda Simcox, Steven E Justiniano, Anne Mathew, Sayan Mitra, Sathiya N Manivannan, Amanda Simcox"
Nutritional supplement chromium picolinate generates chromosomal aberrations and impedes progeny development in Drosophila melanogaster,16887379,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2006.06.019,"Chromium picolinate, [Cr(pic)(3)], is a popular nutritional supplement found in a variety of consumer products. Despite its popularity, safety concerns over its use have arisen. The supplement has been shown to generate clastogenic damage, mitochondrial damage, oxidative damage, and mutagenic effects in cultured cells and oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation in rats. Recently [Cr(pic)(3)] has been demonstrated to generate heritable genetic change and delays in progeny development in Drosophila melanogaster. Based on the damage to chromosomes of cultured cells and of animal models, similar chromosome damage appeared to be a likely source of the mutagenic effects of the supplement in Drosophila. The current three-part study examines the effects of several chromium-containing supplements and their components on hatching and eclosion rates and success of development of first generation progeny of adult Drosophila fed food containing these compounds. It further examines the effects of the compounds on longevity of virgin male and female adults. Finally, the chromosomes in the salivary glands of Drosophila late in the third instar larval stage, which were the progeny of Drosophila whose diets were supplemented with nutritional levels of [Cr(pic)(3)], are shown to contain on average over one chromosomal aberration per two identifiable chromosomal arms. No aberrations were observed in chromosomes of progeny of untreated flies. The results suggest that human consumption of the supplement should be a matter of concern and continued investigation to provide insight into the requirements of chromium-containing supplements to give rise to genotoxic effects.",2006,"Dontarie M Stallings, Dion D D Hepburn, Meredith Hannah, John B Vincent, Janis O'Donnell, Dontarie M Stallings, Dion D D Hepburn, Meredith Hannah, John B Vincent, Janis O'Donnell"

Strong epistatic and additive effects of linked candidate SNPs for Drosophila pigmentation have implications for analysis of genome-wide association studies results,28673357,10.1186/s13059-017-1262-7,"Background:
      
    

    
      The mapping resolution of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is limited by historic recombination events and effects are often assigned to haplotype blocks rather than individual SNPs. It is not clear how many of the SNPs in the block, and which ones, are causative. Drosophila pigmentation is a powerful model to dissect the genetic basis of intra-specific and inter-specific phenotypic variation. Three tightly linked SNPs in the t-MSE enhancer have been identified in three D. melanogaster populations as major contributors to female abdominal pigmentation. This enhancer controls the expression of the pigmentation gene tan (t) in the abdominal epidermis. Two of the three SNPs were confirmed in an independent study using the D. melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel established from a North American population.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We determined the functional impact of SNP1, SNP2, and SNP3 using transgenic lines to test all possible haplotypes in vivo. We show that all three candidate SNPs contribute to female Drosophila abdominal pigmentation. Interestingly, only two SNPs agree with the effect predicted by GWAS; the third one goes in the opposite direction because of linkage disequilibrium between multiple functional SNPs. Our experimental design uncovered strong additive effects for the three SNPs, but we also found significant epistatic effects explaining up to 11% of the total variation.

Wolbachia-mediated antibacterial protection and immune gene regulation in Drosophila,21980455,10.1371/journal.pone.0025430,"The outcome of microbial infection of insects is dependent not only on interactions between the host and pathogen, but also on the interactions between microbes that co-infect the host. Recently the maternally inherited endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia has been shown to protect insects from a range of microbial and eukaryotic pathogens. Mosquitoes experimentally infected with Wolbachia have upregulated immune responses and are protected from a number of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, Plasmodium and filarial nematodes. It has been hypothesised that immune upregulation underpins Wolbachia-mediated protection. Drosophila is a strong model for understanding host-Wolbachia-pathogen interactions. Wolbachia-mediated antiviral protection in Drosophila has been demonstrated for a number of different Wolbachia strains. In this study we investigate whether Wolbachia-infected flies are also protected against pathogenic bacteria. Drosophila simulans lines infected with five different Wolbachia strains were challenged with the pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01, Serratia marcescens and Erwinia carotovora and mortality compared to paired lines without Wolbachia. No difference in mortality was observed in the flies with or without Wolbachia. Similarly no antibacterial protection was observed for D. melanogaster infected with Wolbachia. Interestingly, D. melanogaster Oregon RC flies which are naturally infected with Wolbachia showed no upregulation of the antibacterial immune genes TepIV, Defensin, Diptericin B, PGRP-SD, Cecropin A1 and Attacin D compared to paired flies without Wolbachia. Taken together these results indicate that Wolbachia-mediated antibacterial protection is not ubiquitous in insects and furthermore that the mechanisms of antibacterial and antiviral protection are independent. We suggest that the immune priming and antibacterial protection observed in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes may be a consequence of the recent artificial introduction of the symbiont into insects that normally do not carry Wolbachia and that antibacterial protection is unlikely to be found in insects carrying long-term Wolbachia infections.",2011,"Zhee Sheen Wong, Lauren M Hedges, Jeremy C Brownlie, Karyn N Johnson, Zhee Sheen Wong, Lauren M Hedges, Jeremy C Brownlie, Karyn N Johnson"
"Nonrecombining genes in a recombination environment: the Drosophila ""dot"" chromosome",20940345,10.1093/molbev/msq258,"Rate of recombination is a powerful variable affecting several aspects of molecular variation and evolution. A nonrecombining portion of the genome of most Drosophila species, the ""dot"" chromosome or F element, exhibits very low levels of variation and unusual codon usage. One lineage of Drosophila, the willistoni/saltans groups, has the F element fused to a normally recombining E element. Here, we present polymorphism data for genes on the F element in two Drosophila willistoni and one D. insularis populations, genes previously studied in D. melanogaster. The D. willistoni populations were known to be very low in inversion polymorphism, thus minimizing the recombination suppression effect of inversions. We first confirmed, by in situ hybridization, that D. insularis has the same E + F fusion as D. willistoni, implying this was a monophyletic event. A clear gradient in codon usage exists along the willistoni F element, from the centromere distally to the fusion with E; estimates of recombination rates parallel this gradient and also indicate D. insularis has greater recombination than D. willistoni. In contrast to D. melanogaster, genes on the F element exhibit moderate levels of nucleotide polymorphism not distinguishable from two genes elsewhere in the genome. Although some linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected between polymorphic sites within genes (generally <500 bp apart), no long-range LD between F element loci exists in the two willistoni group species. In general, the distribution of allele frequencies of F element genes display the typical pattern of expectations of neutral variation at equilibrium. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that recombination allows the accumulation of nucleotide variation as well as allows selection to act on synonymous codon usage. It is estimated that the fusion occurred ∼20 Mya and while the F element in the willistoni lineage has evolved ""normal"" levels and patterns of nucleotide variation, equilibrium may not have been reached for codon usage.",2011,"Jeffrey R Powell, Kirstin Dion, Montserrat Papaceit, Montserrat Aguadé, Saverio Vicario, Ryan C Garrick, Jeffrey R Powell, Kirstin Dion, Montserrat Papaceit, Montserrat Aguadé, Saverio Vicario, Ryan C Garrick"
MiniCORVET is a Vps8-containing early endosomal tether in Drosophila,27253064,10.7554/eLife.14226,"Yeast studies identified two heterohexameric tethering complexes, which consist of 4 shared (Vps11, Vps16, Vps18 and Vps33) and 2 specific subunits: Vps3 and Vps8 (CORVET) versus Vps39 and Vps41 (HOPS). CORVET is an early and HOPS is a late endosomal tether. The function of HOPS is well known in animal cells, while CORVET is poorly characterized. Here we show that Drosophila Vps8 is highly expressed in hemocytes and nephrocytes, and localizes to early endosomes despite the lack of a clear Vps3 homolog. We find that Vps8 forms a complex and acts together with Vps16A, Dor/Vps18 and Car/Vps33A, and loss of any of these proteins leads to fragmentation of endosomes. Surprisingly, Vps11 deletion causes enlargement of endosomes, similar to loss of the HOPS-specific subunits Vps39 and Lt/Vps41.

Muscle niche-driven Insulin-Notch-Myc cascade reactivates dormant Adult Muscle Precursors in Drosophila,26650355,10.7554/eLife.08497,"How stem cells specified during development keep their non-differentiated quiescent state, and how they are reactivated, remain poorly understood. Here, we applied a Drosophila model to follow in vivo behavior of adult muscle precursors (AMPs), the transient fruit fly muscle stem cells. We report that emerging AMPs send out thin filopodia that make contact with neighboring muscles. AMPs keep their filopodia-based association with muscles throughout their dormant state but also when they start to proliferate, suggesting that muscles could play a role in AMP reactivation. Indeed, our genetic analyses indicate that muscles send inductive dIlp6 signals that switch the Insulin pathway ON in closely associated AMPs. This leads to the activation of Notch, which regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc. Altogether, we report that Drosophila AMPs display homing behavior to muscle niche and that the niche-driven Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade plays a key role in setting the activated state of AMPs.",2015,"Rajaguru Aradhya, Monika Zmojdzian, Jean Philippe Da Ponte, Krzysztof Jagla, Rajaguru Aradhya, Monika Zmojdzian, Jean Philippe Da Ponte, Krzysztof Jagla"

The confidence intervals for absolute deviations of the theoretical distributions from experimental ones were small (4-5%). In other words, the approximation error was no more than 5% in either case.

Origins and Evolutionary Patterns of the 1.688 Satellite DNA Family in Drosophila Phylogeny,32934018,10.1534/g3.120.401727,"Satellite DNAs (satDNAs) are a ubiquitous feature of eukaryotic genomes and are usually the major components of constitutive heterochromatin. The 1.688 satDNA, also known as the 359 bp satellite, is one of the most abundant repetitive sequences in Drosophila melanogaster and has been linked to several different biological functions. We investigated the presence and evolution of the 1.688 satDNA in 16 Drosophila genomes. We find that the 1.688 satDNA family is much more ancient than previously appreciated, being shared amongst part of the melanogaster group that diverged from a common ancestor ∼27 Mya. We found that the 1.688 satDNA family has two major subfamilies spread throughout Drosophila phylogeny (∼360 bp and ∼190 bp). Phylogenetic analysis of ∼10,000 repeats extracted from 14 of the species revealed that the 1.688 satDNA family is present within heterochromatin and euchromatin. A high number of euchromatic repeats are gene proximal, suggesting the potential for local gene regulation. Notably, heterochromatic copies display concerted evolution and a species-specific pattern, whereas euchromatic repeats display a more typical evolutionary pattern, suggesting that chromatin domains may influence the evolution of these sequences. Overall, our data indicate the 1.688 satDNA as the most perduring satDNA family described in Drosophila phylogeny to date.

Candle soot derived carbon nanoparticles: An assessment of cellular and progressive toxicity using Drosophila melanogaster model,31654826,10.1016/j.cbpc.2019.108646,"The biomedical demand of the nanomaterials is continuously increasing due to their wide range of applications in the field. However, before the implementation of these nanomaterials, toxicity assessment is essential for its safe usage. In the present study, the toxicity of carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) was investigated which was derived from candle soot and compared with commercially available multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. First instar Drosophila larvae were exposed to CNPs as well as CNTs, and the toxic effects of these nanomaterials were compared. The result shows that both nanomaterials enhance the level of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress in the Drosophila, which leads to the upregulation of heat shock proteins that may cause cytotoxicity in exposed Drosophila larvae. In contrast, exposure to CNPs and CNTs did not affect the developmental period of the larvae. Morphology of the internal organs, brain, gut and Malpighian tubules was also not altered in the exposed larvae. Similarly, no change observed in the cytoskeleton (F-actin) of these organs. Reproductive performance was slightly reduced in the case of CNPs compare to control.

Localized microinjection of intact Drosophila melanogaster larva to investigate the effect of serotonin on heart rate,31828261,10.1039/c9lc00963a,"In this paper, we present a novel hybrid microfluidic device for localized microinjection and heart monitoring of intact Drosophila melanogaster larvae at different developmental stages. Drosophila heart at the larval stage has been used as a model for cardiac disorder studies. However, previous pharmacological and toxicological cardiac studies are limited to dissected (semi-intact) Drosophila larvae which cannot be used for post-treatment studies. Challenges associated with microinjection of intact larvae include delicate handling of individual larvae, proper orientation for microneedle penetration, localized microinjection with controlled amount of chemicals into the hemolymph and reversible immobilization for post-injection phenotypic studies, all addressed by our microfluidic device. Larva loading and orientation were achieved by glass capillaries integrated into the PDMS microfluidic device. Side suction channels were used for immobilization prior to heart activity recording. Localized microinjection was achieved with a one degree-of-freedom microneedle and a custom-made pressure driven reagent delivery system, without any adverse effect on heart rate and animal viability. Precision in localized injection into the body cavity close to the heart chamber or the fat body was demonstrated with our microfluidic device. A MATLAB-based heartbeat quantification technique was used to investigate the dose-dependent effect of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), a neurotransmitter, on the heart rate of intact Drosophila larvae, for the first time. Injection of 40 nL serotonin with ≥0.01 mM concentration significantly increased the heart rate of 3rd instar larvae by 21 ± 7% (SEM). Injection of 5 nL serotonin with a concentration of 0.01 mM significantly increased the heart rate of 2nd instar larvae by 12 ± 3% (SEM). The proposed microfluidic injection and heartbeat monitoring technique can be used for dye angiography and hemolymph circulation studies as well as screening intravenous drugs in vivo using the whole-animal Drosophila melanogaster.",2020,"Alireza Zabihihesari, Arthur J Hilliker, Pouya Rezai, Alireza Zabihihesari, Arthur J Hilliker, Pouya Rezai"
Juvenile hormone regulation of Drosophila aging,23866071,10.1186/1741-7007-11-85,"Background:
      
    

    
      Juvenile hormone (JH) has been demonstrated to control adult lifespan in a number of non-model insects where surgical removal of the corpora allata eliminates the hormone's source. In contrast, little is known about how juvenile hormone affects adult Drosophila melanogaster. Previous work suggests that insulin signaling may modulate Drosophila aging in part through its impact on juvenile hormone titer, but no data yet address whether reduction of juvenile hormone is sufficient to control Drosophila life span. Here we adapt a genetic approach to knock out the corpora allata in adult Drosophila melanogaster and characterize adult life history phenotypes produced by reduction of juvenile hormone. With this system we test potential explanations for how juvenile hormone modulates aging.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      A tissue specific driver inducing an inhibitor of a protein phosphatase was used to ablate the corpora allata while permitting normal development of adult flies. Corpora allata knockout adults had greatly reduced fecundity, inhibited oogenesis, impaired adult fat body development and extended lifespan. Treating these adults with the juvenile hormone analog methoprene restored all traits toward wildtype. Knockout females remained relatively long-lived even when crossed into a genotype that blocked all egg production. Dietary restriction further extended the lifespan of knockout females. In an analysis of expression profiles of knockout females in fertile and sterile backgrounds, about 100 genes changed in response to loss of juvenile hormone independent of reproductive state.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Reduced juvenile hormone alone is sufficient to extend the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster. Reduced juvenile hormone limits reproduction by inhibiting the production of yolked eggs, and this may arise because juvenile hormone is required for the post-eclosion development of the vitellogenin-producing adult fat body. Our data do not support a mechanism for juvenile hormone control of longevity simply based on reducing the physiological costs of egg production. Nor does the longevity benefit appear to function through mechanisms by which dietary restriction extends longevity. We identify transcripts that change in response to juvenile hormone independent of reproductive state and suggest these represent somatically expressed genes that could modulate how juvenile hormone controls persistence and longevity.",2013,"Rochele Yamamoto, Hua Bai, Adam G Dolezal, Gro Amdam, Marc Tatar, Rochele Yamamoto, Hua Bai, Adam G Dolezal, Gro Amdam, Marc Tatar"
Genotoxic evaluation of bupivacaine and levobupivacaine in the Drosophila wing spot test,25693764,10.1007/s10616-015-9852-2,"Bupivacaine and levobupivacaine are amino amide local anesthetics commonly used in medical practice.

It has been known that levobupivacaine is preferable to bupivacaine since it may cause cardiovascular and nervous system toxicity. For determining genotoxicity of these anesthetics, we used the wing somatic mutation and recombination test in Drosophila melanogaster. Three-day-old trans-heterozygous larvae were treated with bupivacaine and levobupivacaine. Analysis of the standard crosses indicated that bupivacaine and levobupivacaine did not exhibit mutagenic or recombinogenic activity until toxic doses have been reached at the larval stage. When we examined bupivacaine and levobupivacaine in the HB cross, bupivacaine did not exhibit any genotoxicity at high concentrations (500 µg/mL), but levobupivacaine did exert genotoxicity at high concentrations (1000 µg/mL)-depending on the substantial recombinogenic effect.",2016,"Mehmet Gürbüzel, Ugur Karaca, Nermin Karayilan, Mehmet Gürbüzel, Ugur Karaca, Nermin Karayilan"
Targeted inactivation of the rickets receptor in muscle compromises Drosophila viability,25278473,10.1242/jeb.110098,"Bursicon is a hormone that modulates wing expansion, cuticle hardening and melanization in Drosophila melanogaster. Bursicon activity is mediated through its cognate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), rickets. We have developed a membrane-tethered bursicon construct that enables spatial modulation of rickets-mediated physiology in transgenic flies. Ubiquitous expression of tethered bursicon throughout development results in arrest at the pupal stage. The few organisms that eclose fail to undergo wing expansion. These phenotypes suggest that expression of tethered bursicon inhibits rickets-mediated function. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show in vitro that sustained stimulation of rickets by tethered bursicon leads to receptor desensitization. Furthermore, tissue-specific expression of the tethered bursicon inhibitor unraveled a critical role for rickets in a subset of adult muscles. Taken together, our findings highlight the utility of membrane-tethered inhibitors as important genetic/pharmacological tools to dissect the tissue-specific roles of GPCRs in vivo.",2014,"Benjamin N Harwood, Isabelle Draper, Alan S Kopin, Benjamin N Harwood, Isabelle Draper, Alan S Kopin"

"dTULP, the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of tubby, regulates transient receptor potential channel localization in cilia",24068974,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003814,"Mechanically gated ion channels convert sound into an electrical signal for the sense of hearing. In Drosophila melanogaster, several transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have been implicated to be involved in this process. TRPN (NompC) and TRPV (Inactive) channels are localized in the distal and proximal ciliary zones of auditory receptor neurons, respectively. This segregated ciliary localization suggests distinct roles in auditory transduction. However, the regulation of this localization is not fully understood. Here we show that the Drosophila Tubby homolog, King tubby (hereafter called dTULP) regulates ciliary localization of TRPs. dTULP-deficient flies show uncoordinated movement and complete loss of sound-evoked action potentials. Inactive and NompC are mislocalized in the cilia of auditory receptor neurons in the dTulp mutants, indicating that dTULP is required for proper cilia membrane protein localization.

Although experiments on mice have enormous advantages, they also have some inherent limitations, some of which can be overcome by the use of Drosophila melanogaster as an experimental animal. Among the major advantages of using the fly is its small genome, which can also be modified very easily. The fact that its genome lends itself to diverse alterations (e. g. mutagenesis, transposons) has made the fly a useful organism to perform large-scale and genome-wide screening approaches. This has opened up an entirely new field of experimental research aiming to elucidate genetic interactions and screen for modifiers of disease processes in vivo.

Using this strategy, we have defined a subset of seven Drosophila miRNAs that are likely to participate in the immune response.

Melanotic nodules appear after 4 days. Microarray analysis shows that stress response genes are induced and ecdysone-induced transcription factors are severely repressed in the mutant. Interestingly, the phenotypes of Elp3 flies are similar to those of flies lacking the domino gene, encoding a SWI/SNF-like ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzyme. Indeed, the gene expression profiles of these mutants are also remarkably similar.

Here we report a novel in vivo role of the Drosophila CD2AP/CIN85 ortholog Cindr in both complete and incomplete cytokinesis. We also show evidence for the presence of persistent intercellular bridges in the major larval imaginal disc epithelia. During conventional division of both cultured and embryonic cells, Cindr localizes to cleavage furrows, intercellular bridges, and midbodies. Moreover, in cells undergoing incomplete cytokinesis in the female germline and the somatic ovarian follicle cell and larval imaginal disc epithelia, Cindr localizes to arrested cleavage furrows and stable intercellular bridges, respectively. In these structures, Cindr colocalizes with the essential cytokinesis regulator Anillin. We show that Cindr interacts with Anillin and that depletion of either Cindr or Anillin gives rise to binucleate cells and fewer intercellular bridges in vivo.

Overexpression of Mvl caused Cu accumulation in Drosophila S2 cultured cells and conversely dsRNAi knockdown of endogenous Mvl reduced cellular Cu levels. Cell viability under Cu limiting conditions was reduced following dsRNAi knockdown. A homozygous viable Mvl loss-of-function mutant (Mvl(97f)) was sensitive to excess Cu and female Mvl(97f) flies were also sensitive to Cu limitation. An MtnA-EYFP reporter was used as a proxy measure of Cu distribution within Mvl(97f/+) larvae.

We found that wild-type Drosophila responded appetitively to most high-potency sweeteners preferred by humans, even those not considered sweet by rodents or new world monkeys.

We observed that MLE is the only MSL expressed in the male germ cells and it is not localized to the X chromosome. We conclude that in the germline mle is not involved in chromosomal dosage compensation but may be involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation. We also observed that the acetylation pattern of histone H4 is very dynamic during spermatogenesis.

D. melanogaster was used as a control. The experiments revealed that P elements are transcribed in all species investigated. However, there are differences in the splicing patterns of IVS3, which has to be removed in order to produce transposase mRNA instead of repressor mRNA. These differences are observed among species as well as between the P element subfamilies, the M and the O type, which coexist in the genomes of D. bifasciata and S. pallida. In D. helvetica M-type transposase mRNA was found in the germline and repressor mRNA in the soma, as has been previously described for the canonical (M-type-related) P element of D. melanogaster. In contrast, in S. pallida only repressor mRNA of M-type elements was detected in all tissues. In D. bifasciata, M-type IVS3, although activated both in the soma and the germline, is never completely excised. Instead, two alternative double-spliced variants occur in which two small introns are removed within the IVS3 region. One of these variants codes for a protein 12 aa longer than the regular transposase. Taking these findings together, transposase production and transpositional activity of M-type elements seem to be limited to D. helvetica and D. melanogaster, whereas M-type elements have become immobile in D. bifasciata and S. pallida. Unlike the M type, the splicing of O-type transcripts in D. bifasciata and S. pallida follows the classical rules of tissue-specific P element regulation: transposase mRNA is produced exclusively in the germline whereas repressor mRNA is formed in somatic cells. Thus O-type elements are thought to be still transpositionally active in both species. This finding is in accordance with the postulated recent transfer of O-type elements between the gene pools of D. bifasciata and S. pallida. In addition, we were able to show that the IVS3 double-spliced variants of both P element types are produced regularily in all species of the genus Drosophila investigated so far, but not in S. pallida.",1998,"E Haring, S Hagemann, W Pinsker, E Haring, S Hagemann, W Pinsker"

Early work in this system has uniquely shed light on the basic principles of genetics and resulted in a versatile collection of genetic tools that allow to uncover mechanistic links between genotype and phenotype. Moreover, given its worldwide distribution in diverse habitats and its moderate genome-size, Drosophila has proven very powerful for population genetics inference and was one of the first eukaryotes whose genome was fully sequenced. In this book chapter, we provide a brief historical overview of research in Drosophila and then focus on recent advances during the genomic era. After describing different types and sources of genomic data, we discuss mechanisms of neutral evolution including the demographic history of Drosophila and the effects of recombination and biased gene conversion. Then, we review recent advances in detecting genome-wide signals of selection, such as soft and hard selective sweeps. We further provide a brief introduction to background selection, selection of noncoding DNA and codon usage and focus on the role of structural variants, such as transposable elements and chromosomal inversions, during the adaptive process. Finally, we discuss how genomic data helps to dissect neutral and adaptive evolutionary mechanisms that shape genetic and phenotypic variation in natural populations along environmental gradients. In summary, this book chapter serves as a starting point to Drosophila population genomics and provides an introduction to the system and an overview to data sources, important population genetic concepts and recent advances in the field.",2020,"Annabelle Haudry, Stefan Laurent, Martin Kapun, Annabelle Haudry, Stefan Laurent, Martin Kapun"
Assembly of homotrimeric type XXI minicollagen by coexpression of prolyl 4-hydroxylase in stably transfected Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells,16115607,10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.08.018,"We established stably transfected insect cell lines containing cDNAs encoding the alpha and beta subunits of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase in both Trichoplusia ni and Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. The expression level and enzymatic activity of recombinant prolyl 4-hydroxylase produced in the Drosophila expression system were significantly higher than those produced in the T. ni system. We further characterized the involvement of prolyl 4-hydroxylase in the assembly of the three alpha chains to form trimeric type XXI minicollagen, which comprises the intact C-terminal non-collagenous (NC1) and collagenous domain (COL1), in the Drosophila system. When minicollagen XXI was stably expressed in Drosophila S2 cells alone, negligible amounts of interchain disulfide-bonded trimers were detected in the culture media. However, minicollagen XXI was secreted as disulfide-bonded homotrimers by coexpression with prolyl 4-hydroxylase in the stably transfected Drosophila S2 cells. Minicollagen XXI coexpressed with prolyl 4-hydroxylase contained sufficient amounts of hydroxyproline to form thermal stable pepsin-resistant triple helices consisting of both interchain and non-interchain disulfide-bonded trimers. These results demonstrate that a sufficient amount of active prolyl 4-hydroxylase is required for the assembly of type XXI collagen triple helices in Drosophila cells and the trimeric assembly is governed by the C-terminal collagenous domain.",2005,"Hsiu-Chuan Li, Chuan-Chuan Huang, Sung-Fang Chen, Min-Yuan Chou, Hsiu-Chuan Li, Chuan-Chuan Huang, Sung-Fang Chen, Min-Yuan Chou"
Mechanisms of photic entrainment of activity/rest rhythms in populations of Drosophila selected for divergent timing of eclosion,32079418,10.1080/07420528.2020.1727917,"It is a common notion that phases-of-entrainment of circadian rhythms are adaptive, in that they enable organisms to time their behavior to specific times of the day to enhance their fitness. Therefore, understanding mechanisms that bring about such phases-of-entrainment is crucial to chronobiologists. Our previous studies have shown that selection for morning and evening phasing of adult emergence in Drosophila melanogaster populations leads to divergent coevolution of free-running periods of both adult emergence and activity/rest rhythms, such that early (morning) and late (evening) adult emergence chronotypes have shorter and longer circadian periods, respectively. However, there is little evidence to support the notion that phases-of-entrainment in these fly stocks is indeed driven by non-parametric mechanisms. Extending from a previous hypothesis based on anecdotal evidence for parametric mechanisms being in play, we explore the extent of non-parametric and parametric effects of light on circadian clocks of early and late chronotypes. We systematically tested predictions of the non-parametric model of entrainment, sketched the Circadian Integrated Response Characteristic (CIRC) of our stocks, assessed the effect of light pulses on amplitude of the behavior and the effect of duration of light pulse on phase-shifts of the clock. We demonstrate that, in addition to the differences in clock period, divergent CIRCs contribute to entrainment of the activity/rest rhythm. The differences in CIRC could be explained by differential transient amplitude responses and duration responses of the clock's phase between the early and late chronotypes. Our study thus highlights the role of amplitude responses and phase-shifts due to long durations of light in entrainment of circadian rhythms of D. melanogaster.",2020,"Lakshman Abhilash, Vijay Kumar Sharma, Lakshman Abhilash, Vijay Kumar Sharma"
An investigation into the chemical composition of alternative invertebrate prey,21442652,10.1002/zoo.20382,"The aim of this study was to determine the chemical composition of eight invertebrate species and evaluate their suitability as alternative prey. The species selected were rusty red cockroaches (Blatta lateralis), six-spotted cockroaches (Eublaberus distanti), Madagascar hissing cockroaches (Gromphadorhina portentosa), fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), false katydids (Microcentrum rhombifolium), beetles of the mealworm (Tenebrio molitor), and superworm beetles (Zophobas morio), as well as woodlice (Porcellio scaber). Dry matter (DM), crude protein, crude fat, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, ash, macro and trace minerals, vitamins A and E, and carotenoid concentrations were quantified. Significant differences were found between species. Crude protein content ranged from 38 to 76% DM, fat from14 to 54% DM, and ash from 2 to 8% DM. In most species, calcium:phosphorus was low (0.08-0.30:1); however, P. scaber was an exception (12:1) and might prove useful as a dietary source of calcium for insectivores. Vitamin E content was low for most species (6-16 mg/kg DM), except for D. melanogaster and M. rhombifolium (112 and 110 mg/kg DM). The retinol content, as a measure of vitamin A activity, was low in all specimens, but varied greatly among samples (0.670-886 mg/kg DM). The data presented can be used to alter diets to better suit the estimated requirements of insectivores in captivity.

"Isolation, properties and cellular distribution of D1, a chromosomal protein of Drosophila",6769651,10.1007/BF00291907,"The protein D1 was obtained from nuclei of Drosophila melanogaster embryos and purified by perchloric acid fractionation and preparative gel electrophoresis. In nuclei its amount is approximately 1% of the amount of DNA by weight. D1 is soluble in 5% perchloric acid and extractable from nuclei by solutions of moderate ionic strength (0.35 M NaCl). Amino acid analysis shows that it is rich in both basic (20%) and acidic (27%) aminoacids. In all these properties D1 resembles HMG proteins (high mobility group; Johns et al., 1975) of vertebrates; however, its apparent molecular weight (approximately 50,000) is much higher. The distribution of D1 in salivary gland polytene chromosomes was investigated by immunofluorescence. Two levels of fluorescence intensity were observed: 1) Very bright fluorescence at chromosomal positions 81F, 83E, 101F, 102C and 102F; these sites are shown, by double labeling techniques, to coincide with quinacrine bright sites. 2) Medium to low fluorescence at many sites widely distributed throughout all chromosomes. In order to interpret these results and to relate them to the in vivo distribution of D1, we have investigated the pattern of immunofluorescence staining as a function of the methods of chromosome preparation and salivary gland fixation. The immunological specificity of the anti-D1 serum was studied by comparing its reactivity with D. melanogaster and D. virilis chromosome spreads and whole salivary glands, and by using reagents that minimize non-specific antibody interactions. We conclude that D1 is widely distributed throughout cytoplasm and nucleus, present in many chromomeres but most abundant in chromosomal sites that contain the AT-rich satellite DNA of density 1.672. This distribution, together with available evidence about the nucleotide sequences present in this satellite, suggests that D1 binds preferentially to chromatin containing sequences AATAT and/or AATATAT.",1980,"C Rodriguez Alfageme, G T Rudkin, L H Cohen, C Rodriguez Alfageme, G T Rudkin, L H Cohen"

The 28S rRNA-coding sequence of 16 kb and 13 kb clone was interrupted at precisely the same sites as those where the D. melanogaster rDNA interrupted by the type I and type II intron, respectively. The intron sequences of B. mori were different from those of D. melanogaster. In 16 kb clone, the intron was flanked by 14 bp duplication of the junction sequence, which was also present once within the 28S rRNA-coding region of rDNA without intron.

Sterile induction of innate immunity in Drosophila melanogaster,31136986,,"In the past decades, much has been learned about the protective signatures of innate immune responses during the course of infections. However, it is now evident that induction of immune effectors also commonly occurs in the absence of pathogenic cues. Such an event, termed sterile inflammation, has been linked to several debilitating acute and chronic host conditions. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a simple yet powerful model organism, identification of diverse sets of damage-associated molecular patterns and their corresponding surface and/or inside pattern recognition receptors on the cells, as well as elucidation of their significant roles in the host physiology and pathological conditions related to sterile inflammation, have been continuously reported. In addition, revelation of non-pathogenic molecular triggers leading to the orchestration of unnecessary activation of inflammatory responses has been a subject of interest. Here, we review decades of efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible in the emergence of sterile inflammation.

Gαq and Phospholipase Cβ signaling regulate nociceptor sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster larvae,30258723,10.7717/peerj.5632,"Drosophila melanogaster larvae detect noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli in their environment using polymodal nociceptor neurons whose dendrites tile the larval body wall. Activation of these nociceptors by potentially tissue-damaging stimuli elicits a stereotyped escape locomotion response. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate nociceptor function are increasingly well understood, but gaps remain in our knowledge of the broad mechanisms that control nociceptor sensitivity. In this study, we use cell-specific knockdown and overexpression to show that nociceptor sensitivity to noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli is correlated with levels of Gαq and phospholipase Cβ signaling. Genetic manipulation of these signaling mechanisms does not result in changes in nociceptor morphology, suggesting that changes in nociceptor function do not arise from changes in nociceptor development, but instead from changes in nociceptor activity. These results demonstrate roles for Gαq and phospholipase Cβ signaling in facilitating the basal sensitivity of the larval nociceptors to noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli and suggest future studies to investigate how these signaling mechanisms may participate in neuromodulation of sensory function.",2018,"Joshua A Herman, Adam B Willits, Andrew Bellemer, Joshua A Herman, Adam B Willits, Andrew Bellemer"

However, we still have a limited knowledge of the mechanisms and evolutionary biology of sociability. To enhance our understanding, we developed a new protocol to quantify sociability in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). In a series of experiments with 59 F1 hybrids derived from inbred lines, we documented, first, significant genetic variation in sociability in both males and females, with broad-sense heritabilities of 0.24 and 0.21 respectively. Second, we observed little genetic correlation in sociability between the sexes. Third, we found genetic variation in social plasticity among the hybrids, with a broad-sense heritability of ~0.24. That is, genotypes differed in the degree of sociability after experiencing the same relevant social experience. Our data pave the way for further research on the mechanisms that underlie sociability as well as its ecological and evolutionary consequences.",2018,"Andrew M Scott, Ian Dworkin, Reuven Dukas, Andrew M Scott, Ian Dworkin, Reuven Dukas"
A species-specific multigene family mediates differential sperm displacement in Drosophila melanogaster,29315521,10.1111/evo.13417,"Sperm competition is a postcopulatory sexual selection mechanism in species in which females mate with multiple males. Despite its evolutionary relevance in shaping male traits, the genetic mechanisms underlying sperm competition are poorly understood. A recently originated multigene family specific to Drosophila melanogaster, Sdic, is important for the outcome of sperm competition in doubly mated females, although the mechanistic nature of this phenotype remained unresolved. Here, we compared doubly mated females, second mated to either Sdic knockout or nonknockout males, and directly visualize sperm dynamics in the female reproductive tract. We found that a less effective removal of first-to-mate male's sperm within the female's sperm storage organs is consistent with a reduced sperm competitive ability of the Sdic knockout males.

High-resolution Quantification of Odor-guided Behavior in Drosophila melanogaster Using the Flywalk Paradigm,26709624,10.3791/53394,"In their natural environment, insects such as the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster are bombarded with a huge amount of chemically distinct odorants. To complicate matters even further, the odors detected by the insect nervous system usually are not single compounds but mixtures whose composition and concentration ratios vary. This leads to an almost infinite amount of different olfactory stimuli which have to be evaluated by the nervous system. To understand which aspects of an odor stimulus determine its evaluation by the fly, it is therefore desirable to efficiently examine odor-guided behavior towards many odorants and odor mixtures. To directly correlate behavior to neuronal activity, behavior should be quantified in a comparable time frame and under identical stimulus conditions as in neurophysiological experiments. However, many currently used olfactory bioassays in Drosophila neuroethology are rather specialized either towards efficiency or towards resolution. Flywalk, an automated odor delivery and tracking system, bridges the gap between efficiency and resolution. It allows the determination of exactly when an odor packet stimulated a freely walking fly, and to determine the animal´s dynamic behavioral reaction.",2015,"Michael Thoma, Bill S Hansson, Markus Knaden, Michael Thoma, Bill S Hansson, Markus Knaden"
Regulation of dopamine release by CASK-β modulates locomotor initiation in Drosophila melanogaster,25477794,10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00394,"CASK is an evolutionarily conserved scaffolding protein that has roles in many cell types. In Drosophila, loss of the entire CASK gene or just the CASK-β transcript causes a complex set of adult locomotor defects. In this study, we show that the motor initiation component of this phenotype is due to loss of CASK-β in dopaminergic neurons and can be specifically rescued by expression of CASK-β within this subset of neurons. Functional imaging demonstrates that mutation of CASK-β disrupts coupling of neuronal activity to vesicle fusion. Consistent with this, locomotor initiation can be rescued by artificially driving activity in dopaminergic neurons. The molecular mechanism underlying this role of CASK-β in dopaminergic neurons involves interaction with Hsc70-4, a molecular chaperone previously shown to regulate calcium-dependent vesicle fusion. These data suggest that there is a novel CASK-β-dependent regulatory complex in dopaminergic neurons that serves to link activity and neurotransmitter release.",2014,"Justin B Slawson, Elena A Kuklin, Konark Mukherjee, Nicolás Pírez, Nathan C Donelson, Leslie C Griffith, Justin B Slawson, Elena A Kuklin, Konark Mukherjee, Nicolás Pírez, Nathan C Donelson, Leslie C Griffith"

The effect of environmental temperature on olfactory perception in Drosophila melanogaster,19559705,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2009.06.009,"Olfaction provides chemical information to an animal about its environment. When environmental conditions change, individuals should be able to adequately maintain function. Temperature may influence olfaction in a double manner, as it modifies the concentrations of gaseous compounds and affects biological processes. Here, we address acclimatization to environmental temperature in the olfactory system of Drosophila melanogaster using heat and cold treatments. Because the consequences of temperature shifts persist for some time after the treatment's end, comparison of olfactory behaviors at the same temperature in treated and untreated flies allows us to infer the biological effects of temperature in olfaction. At intermediate odorant concentrations heat always generates a reduction of olfactory sensitivity, as they would be expected to compensate for the increase of volatiles in the air. Cold produces the opposite effect. These changes are observed in both sexes and in natural populations as well as in standard laboratory stocks. Short applications suffice to cause detectable olfactory perception changes, but even prolonged temperature treatments have only a transitory effect. Together, these results suggest that olfaction in Drosophila underlies acclimatization to environmental temperature. However, sensitivity changes are not immediate and may cause imperfect adjustment of olfactory function for short time periods.",2009,"Jacob Riveron, Tamara Boto, Esther Alcorta, Jacob Riveron, Tamara Boto, Esther Alcorta"

We applied the SMART in its standard version with normal bioactivation and in its variant with increased cytochrome P450-dependent biotransformation capacity. Eugenol and safrole produced a positive recombinagenic response only in the improved assay, which was related to a high CYP450-dependent activation capacity. This suggests, as previously reported, the involvement of this family of enzymes in the activation of eugenol and safrole rather than in its detoxification. On the contrary, isoeugenol was clearly non-genotoxic at the same millimolar concentrations as used for eugenol in both the crosses.

It has been demonstrated that the presence of mutant allele flamMS decreases male mating activity irrespective of the presence or absence of mutation white. The active copy of gypsy does not affect mating activity in the absence of the mutation in gene flamenco.

In the present paper the LR asymmetric development of the Drosophila gut is described, in which three major parts, the foregut, midgut and hindgut, show almost invariant LR asymmetry. The asymmetry is generated by a twist of each part in particular orientations, resulting in a left-handed (sinistral) convolution as a whole. The frequency of spontaneous reversal of LR orientations is very low (< 0.6%) and reversal of each part of the gut occurs independently. The bicoid mutation causes duplication of the posterior half of the gut, essentially keeping the left-handed twist, suggesting that the LR asymmetry may depend on some intrinsic nature of the cells or tissues rather than a graded distribution of morphogens in the egg. The handedness of particular gut parts was randomized or became symmetric in mutants of brachyenteron, huckebein and patched, suggesting that different gene pathways can interfere in determining LR asymmetry of the gut.

Chromosomal localization and regulation of the longevity determinant genes in a selected strain of Drosophila melanogaster,8360075,10.1038/hdy.1993.102,"A controlled chromosome substitution experiment was performed on a strain (NDC-L) selected for long life to determine if the genes responsible for the extended-longevity phenotype could be localized to any particular chromosome(s). All 27 different possible combinations of the three major chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster were constructed and longevities were determined on 3875 individual animals of both sexes and analysed. The results are statistically significant and demonstrate that mean longevity is specified primarily by recessive genes on the third chromosome (c3). The extended longevity phenotype (ELP) is only expressed in those lines which are homozygous for the NDC-L type c3. Loci on the first (c1) and second (c2) chromosomes interact, both positively (c1) and negatively (c2), respectively, such that c1 represses c2 which in turn represses c3. The ELP is fully expressed in the mutual presence and mutual absence of c1 and c2. The significance of these results is discussed in the context of broader categories of molecular genetic mechanisms suggested previously to be involved in the modulation of longevity in Drosophila.",1993,"S Buck, R A Wells, S P Dudas, G T Baker 3rd, R Arking, S Buck, R A Wells, S P Dudas, G T Baker 3rd, R Arking"
[Role of heat-shock proteins in the recovery of mitotic chromosome damage induced by high temperature in Drosophila melanogaster],8354470,,"The synthesis of the heat-shock proteins (HSP) and the frequency of the mitotic chromosome damages (pulverizations, chromosome, chromatid stickiness, etc.) was studied in the cells of larva nervous ganglion in the process of recovery after heat shock (37 degrees C, 30 min). Analysis was performed in two strains of Drosophila melanogaster (Canton S-the wild type and the mutant l(1)ts403 with the defect in the HSP system). Correlation between the dynamics of HSP synthesis and the alteration of the chromosome pulverization and stickiness frequency was shown for both Drosophila strains under study. These results, in accord with the data on HSPs' binding to chromosomes following heat shock and their role as molecular chaperones, allowed to suggest that HSPs took part in chromosome condensation and in the recovery of heat shock induced damages leading to chromosome and chromatid stickiness.",1993,"L A Mamon, Iu A Kutskova, L A Mamon, Iu A Kutskova"
Identification of the coding sequence for a reverse transcriptase-like enzyme in a transposable genetic element in Drosophila melanogaster,6209583,10.1038/312659a0,"The largest group of transposable elements in Drosophila melanogaster, copia-like elements, share some important structural features with and are intimately related in evolution to vertebrate retroviruses. To further clarify the relationship between retroviruses and copia-like transposable elements, we set out to determine the complete nucleotide sequence of the genome of 17.6, which has long terminal repeats homologous in nucleotide sequence to those of avian leukaemia-sarcoma virus. We report here that 17.6 contains three long open reading frames comparable with gag, pol and env genes in retrovirus. At the level of amino acid sequence, the longest open reading frame of 17.6 includes a coding sequence similar to that for reverse transcriptase, suggesting a role for this enzyme in the life cycle of some Drosophila copia-like elements, analogous to the situation in retrovirus.",1984,"K Saigo, W Kugimiya, Y Matsuo, S Inouye, K Yoshioka, S Yuki, K Saigo, W Kugimiya, Y Matsuo, S Inouye, K Yoshioka, S Yuki"
Regulatory gene evolution: adaptive differences in expression of alcohol dehydrogenase in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,6429088,10.1038/hdy.1984.23,"In Drosophila melanogaster X D. simulans hybrids, the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) electromorphs characteristic of the two parents display tissue- and stage-specific differences in relative level of expression. This implies distinct cis-acting regulatory elements associated with the respective Adh alleles. These cis-acting elements account in part, but not completely, for markedly different overall patterns of ADH expression in the two species. The regulatory patterns seem to be adaptively significant since they correlate with species-specific patterns of ethanol tolerance. The activity differences are accounted for by different levels of enzyme protein, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully analysed and may be complex. Independent evolution of various aspects of the ADH developmental programme may relate to use of different promoters for transcription of the Adh locus in different developmental contexts. This system illustrates the potential importance of regulatory genes in evolution and provides a model for investigating the molecular basis of evolved regulatory differences.",1984,"W J Dickinson, R G Rowan, M D Brennan, W J Dickinson, R G Rowan, M D Brennan"

Strikingly, however, satellite cells, the adult muscle stem cells that are essential for the regeneration of damaged muscles in vertebrates, have not been reported in invertebrates. In this study, we show that lineal descendants of muscle stem cells are present in adult muscle of Drosophila as small, unfused cells observed at the surface and in close proximity to the mature muscle fibers. Normally quiescent, following muscle fiber injury, we show that these cells express Zfh1 and engage in Notch-Delta-dependent proliferative activity and generate lineal descendant populations, which fuse with the injured muscle fiber.

Serine esterases: structural conservation during animal evolution and variability in enzymatic properties in the genus Drosophila,2124571,10.1007/BF00226451,"Both general esterases and acetylcholinesterases have been shown to be members of a homologous superfamily of serine esterases. A comparison of N-terminal sequences demonstrates that esterase-4 and -5 from Drosophila mojavensis belong to this family as well, with esterase-6 and esterase-P from D. melanogaster being the closest relatives. In order to investigate the presence of immunologically related esterases in other Drosophila species, crude larval extracts from five species were applied to two immunoaffinity columns with antibodies directed against esterase-4 and esterase-5 from D. mojavensis. The substrate preference for either 1- or 2-naphthyl acetate was determined. Both esterase-4 and esterase-5 from D. mojavensis are 'normally' specific for 2-naphthyl esters, but at least three of the cross-reacting esterases from the other species have a preference for 1-naphthyl esters.

Splicing factors Sf3A2 and Prp31 have direct roles in mitotic chromosome segregation,30475206,10.7554/eLife.40325,"Several studies have shown that RNAi-mediated depletion of splicing factors (SFs) results in mitotic abnormalities. However, it is currently unclear whether these abnormalities reflect defective splicing of specific pre-mRNAs or a direct role of the SFs in mitosis. Here, we show that two highly conserved SFs, Sf3A2 and Prp31, are required for chromosome segregation in both Drosophila and human cells. Injections of anti-Sf3A2 and anti-Prp31 antibodies into Drosophila embryos disrupt mitotic division within 1 min, arguing strongly against a splicing-related mitotic function of these factors. We demonstrate that both SFs bind spindle microtubules (MTs) and the Ndc80 complex, which in Sf3A2- and Prp31-depleted cells is not tightly associated with the kinetochores; in HeLa cells the Ndc80/HEC1-SF interaction is restricted to the M phase.

Deficiency of parkin and PINK1 impairs age-dependent mitophagy in Drosophila,29809156,10.7554/eLife.35878,"Mutations in the genes for PINK1 and parkin cause Parkinson's disease. PINK1 and parkin cooperate in the selective autophagic degradation of damaged mitochondria (mitophagy) in cultured cells. However, evidence for their role in mitophagy in vivo is still scarce. Here, we generated a Drosophila model expressing the mitophagy probe mt-Keima. Using live mt-Keima imaging and correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), we show that mitophagy occurs in muscle cells and dopaminergic neurons in vivo, even in the absence of exogenous mitochondrial toxins. Mitophagy increases with aging, and this age-dependent rise is abrogated by PINK1 or parkin deficiency. Knockdown of the Drosophila homologues of the deubiquitinases USP15 and, to a lesser extent, USP30, rescues mitophagy in the parkin-deficient flies. These data demonstrate a crucial role for parkin and PINK1 in age-dependent mitophagy in Drosophila in vivo.",2018,"Tom Cornelissen, Sven Vilain, Katlijn Vints, Natalia Gounko, Patrik Verstreken, Wim Vandenberghe, Tom Cornelissen, Sven Vilain, Katlijn Vints, Natalia Gounko, Patrik Verstreken, Wim Vandenberghe"
Peptidoglycan sensing by octopaminergic neurons modulates Drosophila oviposition,28264763,10.7554/eLife.21937,"As infectious diseases pose a threat to host integrity, eukaryotes have evolved mechanisms to eliminate pathogens. In addition to develop strategies reducing infection, animals can engage in behaviors that lower the impact of the infection. The molecular mechanisms by which microbes impact host behavior are not well understood. We demonstrate that bacterial infection of Drosophila females reduces oviposition and that peptidoglycan, the component that activates Drosophila antibacterial response, is also the elicitor of this behavioral change. We show that peptidoglycan regulates egg-laying rate by activating NF-κB signaling pathway in octopaminergic neurons and that, a dedicated peptidoglycan degrading enzyme acts in these neurons to buffer this behavioral response. This study shows that a unique ligand and signaling cascade are used in immune cells to mount an immune response and in neurons to control fly behavior following infection.

The JH degradation rate and the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC) activities were used as indicators of the JH synthesis rate. Treatment of the flies with butaclamol, a specific DopR antagonist, has been demonstrated to increase the JH degradation rate, and the stress reactivity of the system of JH metabolism and decrease the ALP activity and stress reactivity, and increase the TDC activity and stress reactivity. As shown earlier, all this indicates a decrease in the JH synthesis rate in young female drosophila with a decreased DopR availability.

Here, we used Drosophila melanogaster, in conjunction with the biosafety level 2 (BSL2) Nine Mile phase II (NMII) clone 4 strain of C. burnetii, as a model to investigate host and bacterial components implicated in infection. We demonstrate that adult Drosophila flies are susceptible to C. burnetii NMII infection and that this bacterial strain, which activates the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway, is able to replicate and cause mortality in the animals. We show that in the absence of Eiger, the only known tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily homolog in Drosophila, Coxiella-infected flies exhibit reduced mortality from infection. We also demonstrate that the Coxiella type 4 secretion system (T4SS) is critical for the formation of the Coxiella-containing vacuole and establishment of infection in Drosophila Altogether, our data reveal that the Drosophila TNF homolog Eiger and the Coxiella T4SS are implicated in the pathogenesis of C. burnetii in flies.

Recent advances in the neural regulation of feeding behavior in adult Drosophila,31168968,10.1631/jzus.B1900080,"The ability to maintain metabolic homeostasis is a key capability critical for the survival and well-being of animals living in constantly changing environments. Metabolic homeostasis depends on neuromodulators, such as biogenic amines, neuropeptides, and hormones, to signal changes in animals' internal metabolic status and to orchestrate their behaviors accordingly. An important example is the regulation of feeding behavior by conserved molecular and cellular mechanisms across the animal kingdom. Its relatively simple brain coupled with well-characterized genetics and behavioral paradigms makes the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster an excellent model for investigating the neuromodulatory regulation of feeding behavior. In this review we discuss the neuromodulators and neural circuits that integrate the internal physiological status with external sensory cues and modulate feeding behavior in adult fruit flies.

      How experience and individuality shape action selection remains a major question in neuroscience. Visually-evoked escape behavior within Drosophila melanogaster provides a robust model to study these mechanisms within neural circuits but requires novel assays to circumvent limitations of current behavior assays.
    

    
  


        Method:
      
    

    
      Here we describe and characterize a simple, low to moderate cost, and flexible assay for studying visually-evoked escape responses in tethered flies. This assay consists of a DLP projector, cylindrical rear projection screen, and an automated flight interruption motor all controlled within a MATLAB environment.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We find this assay effectively recapitulates fly behaviors previously observed in free behavior assays, and provides a novel opportunity to investigate the behavior of individual flies over the course of numerous stimulus presentations.

We aimed to determine the fate of these hybrid males. To do so, we tracked the development of hybrid females and males using classic genetic markers and techniques. We found that hybrid males die predominantly as embryos with severe segment-specification defects while a large proportion of hybrid females embryos hatch and survive to adulthood. In particular, we show that most male embryos show a characteristic abdominal ablation phenotype, not observed in either parental species.

The inference is made more rigorous and flexible by providing a better approximation of the probabilities of patterns of mutations and an improved coalescent algorithm within a single host with realistic assumptions. The properties of the inference framework, both the estimation and the hypothesis testing, were investigated by simulation. The refined inference framework is shown to provide (1) nearly unbiased maximum-likelihood estimates of mutation rates and (2) robust hypothesis testing using the standard asymptotic distribution of the likelihood-ratio tests.

Evolvability of Hsp70 expression under artificial election for inducible thermotolerance in independent populations of Drosophila melanogaster,12324888,10.1086/342350,"To test whether expression of the inducible heat-shock protein Hsp70 increases under selection for inducible thermotolerance in Drosophila melanogaster, we performed artificial selection on replicate sets of Drosophila lines founded from two independent populations. Selection entailed pretreatment at 36 degrees C to induce thermotolerance and Hsp70 expression, followed by a more severe heat shock, whose temperature varied between sexes and among generations to achieve 50% mortality. Inducible thermotolerance increased slowly and continuously in selected lines and was 37%-50% greater than in controls after 10-11 generations. Lines founded from the two populations differed in their coevolution of Hsp70 expression. In lines founded from Evolution Canyon, Israel, Hsp70 level initially increased and thereafter was unchanged; replicate lines exhibited two temporal patterns of response to selection. In lines founded from Australia, Hsp70 levels increased throughout selection. In both cases, however, the increase in Hsp70 level averaged only 15%, suggesting that pleiotropy in Hsp70 function constrains evolutionary increase in its expression.",2002,"Martin E Feder, Trevor B C Bedford, Daisy R Albright, Pawel Michalak, Martin E Feder, Trevor B C Bedford, Daisy R Albright, Pawel Michalak"
Novel CNS glutamate receptor subunit genes of Drosophila melanogaster,11032867,10.1046/j.1471-4159.2000.0751791.x,"We report the identification and characterization of two genes from Drosophila melanogaster that encode novel ionotropic glutamate receptor proteins, named DGluR-IB and DNMDAR-II, and that are located on chromosome 3L, region 67AB, and the X chromosome, position 2B, respectively. The DGluR-IB full-length cDNA was isolated from Drosophila embryonic and head libraries. The encoded protein of 1,095 amino acids displays high sequence identity (73%) to DGluR-IA. The DNMDAR-II gene was identified by sequence-homology searches in databases. The deduced protein shows moderate sequence identity (29-31%) to the mouse NMDAR2A-D receptor subunits. Whole-mount in situ hybridization on embryos revealed DGluR-IB and DNMDAR-II transcripts in the CNS.

Dopamine and senescence in Drosophila melanogaster,10794859,10.1016/s0197-4580(99)00109-8,"Five-day-old Drosophila melanogaster males, when exposed to 2-h-old males, will perform courtship rituals; the intensity and duration of this behavior rapidly diminishes with time. The ability of the older males to habituate to the attractive signals given off by the younger males is a dopaminergic-modulated experience-dependent modification of behavior that is abolished with increasing age. Dopamine-depleted females show increased resistance to copulation; 20-day-old females demonstrated an increase in copulation avoidance compared with younger (5-15-day-old) females. These changes in dopaminergic-modulated behaviors observed during aging parallel declines in whole body levels of dopamine. Immunocytochemical analysis of adult brains using an antibody raised against Drosophila tyrosine hydroxylase to visualize catecholaminergic cell bodies revealed increased degeneration of the cell bodies with aging. These results suggest that the deficits seen in dopaminergic-modulated behaviors may arise as a consequence of degenerative changes within the aging brain.",2000,"W S Neckameyer, S Woodrome, B Holt, A Mayer, W S Neckameyer, S Woodrome, B Holt, A Mayer"

Three of these proteins, CaBP1, CaBP2, and protein disulfide isomerase, have been purified from rat microsomes and analyzed biochemically. However, their function in vivo has not been determined. Here, we report the isolation of a homologue of the CaBP1 gene from the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster (DmCaBP1). The predicted sequence of the Drosophila protein is very similar to that of rat CaBP1 and retains motifs thought to be functionally important in the mammalian protein. We show that DmCaBP1 is expressed in a specific spatiotemporal pattern during embryogenesis. In particular, it is expressed in midline precursor cells in the developing CNS. This is the first demonstration of tissue-specific expression for a member of this group of ER proteins and suggests a possible role for DmCABP1 as a molecular chaperone involved in nervous system development.

We generated PTPA deletion mutants of these conserved regions as well as point mutations within regions that were suggested to be functionally important. The recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli and subsequently purified. Activity measurements, linked with immunological detection, revealed that most of the well-conserved regions are essential for PTPA activity. However, neither the type A fragment of the putative ATP binding site nor the cysteine-rich region, present in all but the Drosophila and yeast homologues, appeared to be essential for PTPA activity.

"[A genetic factor, suppressing DNA underreplication in Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes]",9719924,,"The Drosophila melanogaster line carrying the In(I)scv2 was found to exhibit unique cytological phenotype distinguished by the lack of ""weak"" points in the intercalary heterochromatin of the salivary gland polytene chromosomes, the absence of ectopic contacts between the chromosome regions, and the occurrence of additional intercalary heterochromatin in the centromeric regions. Southern blot hybridization revealed the absence of DNA underreplication in the intercalary heterochromatin region 39E carrying the histone gene cluster. This phenotype may have arisen under the influence of a genetic factor, Su(UR), which suppressed DNA underreplication in polytene chromosomes. Genetic analysis of the inheritance of the ""suppression of DNA underreplication"" phenotype showed that this factor was located in the third chromosome and was expressed in a semidominant manner. Discovery of Su(UR) suggested existence of common mechanisms regulating DNA underreplication in the centromeric and intercalary heterochromatin regions containing genes that were completely inactivated during ontogeny.

We also demonstrate that incubation with dopamine in vitro induces premature melanization in wild type unpigmented pharate adults several hours before the developmentally programmed onset of melanization, supporting the hypothesis that the availability of catecholamines may be the limiting factor determining the onset of melanization and that the major enzymatic activities that act downstream of dopa decarboxylase in the pathway are deposited into the cuticle before pigmentation begins. In vitro melanization studies with various pigmentation mutants that are associated with critical enzymatic steps in Drosophila catecholamine metabolism are consistent with their proposed function and suggest a central role of N-beta-alanyldopamine in adult cuticle pigmentation.",1996,"M F Walter, L L Zeineh, B C Black, W E McIvor, T R Wright, H Biessmann, M F Walter, L L Zeineh, B C Black, W E McIvor, T R Wright, H Biessmann"

While CD and fluorescence spectroscopy showed that the protein had completely lost its tertiary and secondary structures in approximately 3 M urea, solvent accessibility of the tryptophan residues was still partial, as determined by acrylamide quenching. This suggested the presence of significant amounts of residual structure which persisted until the urea concentration was raised to approximately 6.0 M. Thermal-denaturation experiments also indicated the presence of an intermediate in the unfolding pathway. The experimental data could be fitted assuming a minimum of three states in both modes of denaturation. The thermodynamic parameters for the apparent three-state transition have been determined.

Phenotypic consequences of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase overexpression in Drosophila melanogaster,1964925,10.1139/g90-130,"We report here the isolation of a tandem duplication of a small region of the third chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster containing the Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (cSOD) gene.

The biological consequences of hypermorphic levels of cSOD in genotypes carrying this duplication have been investigated under diverse conditions of oxygen stress imposed by acute exposure to ionizing radiation, chronic exposure to paraquat, and the normoxia of standard laboratory culture. We find that a 50% increase in cSOD activity above the normal diploid level confers increased resistance to ionizing radiation and, in contrast, confers decreased resistance to the superoxide-generating agent paraquat. The duplication is associated with a minor increase in adult life-span under conditions of normoxia.

The in situ functioning of this enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates has been analyzed directly in insects by transferring the opd gene into embryos of Drosophila melanogaster by P element-mediated transformation. The chromosomal locations of this stably inherited transgenic locus differed from strain to strain and demonstrated various expressivity on the whole-insect basis. Transcriptional induction of opd in one of these strains under control of the Drosophila heat shock promoter, hsp70, resulted in the synthesis of stable active enzyme that accumulated to high levels with repeated induction.

The prepupal peak is not seen when the temperature-sensitive ecdysoneless mutant ecd-1 is shifted to 29° C at mid-third instar larval stage. The peak in activity reappears when ecd-1 is either shifted back to 20° C after 60 h at 29° C or is fed 20-hydroxyecdysone. At the restrictive temperature, imaginal discs from ecd-1 larvae progressively lose AK activity, whereas discs from 20-hydroxyecdysone-fed larvae have a marked increase in AK activity at stage P3 of the prepupal period.

Both light- and dark-adapted normal retinular cells contained elaborate networks of anastomosing tubules of SRC immediately beneath the rhabdomeres. Tubules connecting the SRC and rough endoplasmic reticulum were frequently seen. The SRC were absent from the retinular cells of rdgAKS60 whose rhabdomeres degenerate gradually after eclosion. Instead, numerous smooth vesicles were observed in the subrhabdomeric regions. In rdgBEE170, in which rhabdomere degeneration is light dependent, the SRC appeared normal in the dark-adapted flies. But their SRC gradually disintegrated after exposure to light. In norpASB37, whose rhabdomeres are small but do not degenerate, SRC appeared normal.

On the basis of comparisons of puffing between digitonin-treated and intact salivary glands, the puffs were classified into three categories: (1) digitonin-unaffected preexisting puffs (8 sites), (2) digitonin-activated preexisting puffs (6 sites), and (3) digitonin-induced new puffs (""digitonin puffs"", 29 sites). The digitonin puffs included some of the developmentally regulated puffs and all the heat-shock puffs known in Drosophila melanogaster.

Aberrant oogenesis in the patterning mutant dicephalic of Drosophila melanogaster: time-lapse recordings and volumetry in vitro,28305548,10.1007/BF00395950,"Drosophila females homozygous for the mutation dicephalic occasionally produce ovarian follicles with a nurse-cell cluster on each oocyte pole (dic follicles). Most dic follicles contain 15 nurse cells as in the normal follicle, but the total nurse-cell volume is larger in dic follicles; this is in keeping with the increase in DNA content recently described. However, the relative increase in oocyte volume during nurse-cell regression (from stage 10B onward) is not significantly larger in dic than in normal follicles. Time-lapse recordings in vitro show that, as a rule, both nurse cell clusters in a dic follicle export cytoplasm to the oocyte but nurse-cell regression remains incomplete at both poles and the persisting remnants of the nurse cells cause anomalies in chorion shape. The kinematics of cytoplasmic transfer are less aberrant at that oocyte pole which harbours the germinal vesicle. Possible links are discussed between these anomalies of oogenesis and the double-anterior embryonic patterns observed in the majority of developing dic eggs.",1987,"Johannes Bohrmann, Klaus Sander, Johannes Bohrmann, Klaus Sander"

"Diapause in Drosophila melanogaster - Photoperiodicity, cold tolerance and metabolites",29339232,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2018.01.003,"Unlike many insects where photoperiod per se induces diapause, reproductive arrest in Drosophila melanogaster adult females is observed at colder temperatures and can be enhanced by shorter photoperiods. Traditional experimental protocols raise flies at 25 °C from the larval stage and then the adults are placed at 12 °C for between 12 and 28 days. After 12 days diapause levels are usually higher than at 28 days, suggesting that the flies are in a cold induced quiescence, rather than a true diapause. By raising flies at more realistic lower temperatures, we observe quite dramatic and counter-intuitive effects on diapause, whose levels nevertheless correlate with various indices of cryoprotectant metabolites as well as resistance to chill shock. We also observe that photoperiodic effects are minimised when very small temperature oscillations associated with the light-dark incubator cycles are neutralised. Our results suggest that the reported photoperiodic component of fly diapause, at least in these strains, is mostly due to thermoperiodic rather than photoperiodic stimuli.

Addicted? Reduced host resistance in populations with defensive symbionts,27335421,10.1098/rspb.2016.0778,"Heritable symbionts that protect their hosts from pathogens have been described in a wide range of insect species. By reducing the incidence or severity of infection, these symbionts have the potential to reduce the strength of selection on genes in the insect genome that increase resistance. Therefore, the presence of such symbionts may slow down the evolution of resistance. Here we investigated this idea by exposing Drosophila melanogaster populations to infection with the pathogenic Drosophila C virus (DCV) in the presence or absence of Wolbachia, a heritable symbiont of arthropods that confers protection against viruses. After nine generations of selection, we found that resistance to DCV had increased in all populations. However, in the presence of Wolbachia the resistant allele of pastrel-a gene that has a major effect on resistance to DCV-was at a lower frequency than in the symbiont-free populations. This finding suggests that defensive symbionts have the potential to hamper the evolution of insect resistance genes, potentially leading to a state of evolutionary addiction where the genetically susceptible insect host mostly relies on its symbiont to fight pathogens.",2016,"Julien Martinez, Rodrigo Cogni, Chuan Cao, Sophie Smith, Christopher J R Illingworth, Francis M Jiggins, Julien Martinez, Rodrigo Cogni, Chuan Cao, Sophie Smith, Christopher J R Illingworth, Francis M Jiggins"

Female Ddx1 null flies have reduced fertility with egg chambers undergoing autophagy, whereas males are sterile due to disrupted spermatogenesis. Comparative RNA sequencing of control and Ddx1 null third instars identified several transcripts affected by Ddx1 inactivation. One of these, Sirup mRNA, was previously shown to be overexpressed under starvation conditions and implicated in mitochondrial function. We demonstrate that Sirup is a direct binding target of Ddx1 and that Sirup mRNA is differentially spliced in the presence or absence of Ddx1.

Fruit flies were raised on a diets consisting of extracts of either conventionally or organically raised produce (bananas, potatoes, raisins, soy beans). Flies were then subjected to a variety of tests designed to assess overall fly health. Flies raised on diets made from organically grown produce had greater fertility and longevity. On certain food sources, greater activity and greater stress resistance was additionally observed, suggesting that organic food bestows positive effects on fly health.

ppk23-Dependent chemosensory functions contribute to courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,22438833,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002587,"Insects utilize diverse families of ion channels to respond to environmental cues and control mating, feeding, and the response to threats.

We found that the DEG/ENaC channel ppk23 is expressed in a subpopulation of sexually dimorphic gustatory-like chemosensory bristles that are distinct from those expressing feeding-related gustatory receptors. Disrupting ppk23 or inhibiting activity of ppk23-expressing neurons did not alter gustatory responses. Instead, blocking ppk23-positive neurons or mutating the ppk23 gene delayed the initiation and reduced the intensity of male courtship. Furthermore, mutations in ppk23 altered the behavioral response of males to the female-specific aphrodisiac pheromone 7(Z), 11(Z)-Heptacosadiene.

DNApol-ϵ gene is indispensable for the survival and growth of Drosophila melanogaster,21898761,10.1002/dvg.20791,"Based on deletion and complementation mapping and DNA sequencing, a new recessive fully penetrant mutation (DNApol-ϵpl10R), causing prolonged larval life and larval/early pupal lethality, is identified as the first mutant allele of the DNApol-ϵ (CG6768) gene of Drosophila melanogaster. A same-sense base pair substitution in exon 1 of the DNApol-ϵ gene is associated with retention of the first intron and significant reduction in DNApol-ϵ transcripts in DNApol-ϵpl10R homozygotes. Homozygous mutant larvae show small imaginal discs with fewer cells and reduced polyteny in salivary glands, presumably because of the compromised DNA polymerase function following exhaustion of the maternal contribution. Extremely small and rare DNApol-ϵpl10R homozygous somatic clones in DNApol-ϵpl10R/+imaginal discs confirm their poor mitotic activity. The DNApol-ϵpl10R homozygotes, like those expressing DNApol-ϵ-RNAi transgene, show high sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. The first mutant allele of the DNApol-ϵ gene will facilitate functional characterization of this enzyme in the genetically tractable Drosophila model.",2012,"Akanksha Verma, Sonali Sengupta, Subhash C Lakhotia, Akanksha Verma, Sonali Sengupta, Subhash C Lakhotia"
Attenuation of rotenone-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage and neurotoxicty in Drosophila melanogaster supplemented with creatine,20514516,10.1007/s11064-010-0198-z,"Creatine (Cr), an ergogenic nutritional supplement is demonstrated to possess bioenergetic, antiexcitotoxic and antioxidant properties. This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of Cr against rotenone induced oxidative stress, mortality and neurotoxicty in Drosophila melanogaster. We found significant diminution in the endogenous levels of oxidative markers in whole body homogenates of flies exposed to Cr (2-10 mM). Cr supplementation resulted in reduced mortality in flies exposed to rotenone (500 microM) and better performance in a negative geotaxis assay. Further Cr (10 mM) markedly offset rotenone induced mitochondrial oxidative stress, completely restored the GSH levels, nitric oxide levels, activity of Mn-SOD and dopamine depletion. In an oxidative stress bioassay, flies given Cr prophylaxis exhibited marked resistance to paraquat exposure. These data allow us to hypothesize that the neuroprotective action of Cr in Drosophila may be related to its direct antioxidant activity and ability to abrogate rotenone induced mitochondrial oxidative stress.",2010,"Ravikumar Hosamani, Saraf R Ramesh, Muralidhara, Ravikumar Hosamani, Saraf R Ramesh, Muralidhara"

Standard (ST) cross larvae were treated chronically with solutions containing 25%, 50% or 100% of an aqueous extract of ORT, in the absence and presence of DXR (0.125 mg/mL), and the number of mutant spots on the wings of emergent flies was counted. ORT alone was not genotoxic but enhanced the toxicity of DXR when administered concomitantly with DXR.

Mitochondria and ageing in Drosophila,18446867,10.1002/biot.200800015,"Studies in different organisms have revealed that ageing is a complex process involving a tight regulation of gene expression. Among other features, ageing organisms generally display an increased oxidative stress and a decreased mitochondrial function. The increase in oxidative stress can be attributable to reactive oxygen species, which are mainly produced by mitochondria as a by-product of energy metabolism. Consistent with these data, mitochondria have been suggested to play a significant role in lifespan determination. The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster is a well-suited organism to study ageing as it is relatively short-lived, mainly composed of post-mitotic cells, has sequenced nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, and multiple genetic tools are available. It has been used in genome-wide studies to unveil the molecular signature of ageing, in different feeding and dietary restriction protocols and in overexpression and down-regulation studies to examine the effect of specific compounds or genes/proteins on lifespan.

Inhibitory activity of the Drosophila melanogaster serpin Necrotic is dependent on lysine residues in the D-helix,16835244,10.1074/jbc.M606085200,"Necrotic is a member of the serine protease inhibitor or serpin superfamily.

Necrotic contains three basic lysine residues within the D-helix that are homologous to those found in the heparin-binding domain of antithrombin and heparin co-factor II. We show here that substitution of all three lysine residues for glutamines caused cellular necrosis and premature death in Drosophila in keeping with a loss of function phenotype. The lysine to glutamine substitutions had no effect on the overall structure of recombinant Necrotic protein but abolished the formation of stable complexes with target proteases. Individual substitutions with either glutamine or alanine demonstrated that lysine 68 was the most critical residue for inhibitory activity. Despite the homology to other serpins, Necrotic did not bind, nor was it activated by sulfated glycans. These data demonstrate a critical role for basic residues within the D-helix (and lysine 68 in particular) in the inhibitory mechanism of the serpin Necrotic.",2006,"Andrew S Robertson, Didier Belorgey, David Gubb, Timothy R Dafforn, David A Lomas, Andrew S Robertson, Didier Belorgey, David Gubb, Timothy R Dafforn, David A Lomas"
Genetic recombination and adaptation to fluctuating environments: selection for geotaxis in Drosophila melanogaster,12815456,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800283,"Heritable variation in fitness is the fuel of adaptive evolution, and sex can generate new adaptive combinations of alleles. If the generation of beneficial combinations drives the evolution of recombination, then the level of recombination should result in changes in the response to selection. Three types of lines of Drosophila melanogaster varying in their level of genetic recombination were selected over 38 generations for geotaxis. The within-chromosome recombination level of these lines was controlled for 60% of the genome: chromosome X and chromosome II. The full recombination lines had normal, unmanipulated levels of recombination on these two chromosomes. Conversely, nonrecombination lines had recombination effectively eliminated within the X and second chromosomes. Finally, partial recombination lines had the effective rate of within-chromosome recombination lowered to 10% of natural levels for these two chromosomes. The rate of response to selection was measured for continuous negative geotaxis and for a fluctuating environment (alternating selection for negative and positive geotaxis). All selected Drosophila lines responded to selection and approximately 36% of the response to selection was because of the X and second chromosomes. However, recombination did not accelerate adaptation during either directional or fluctuating selection for geotaxis.",2003,"D Bourguet, J Gair, M Mattice, M C Whitlock, D Bourguet, J Gair, M Mattice, M C Whitlock"

An adenosine deaminase acting on tRNAs, scTad1p (also known as scADAT1), cloned from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a deaminase domain related to the ADARs but lacks dsRNA-binding domains. We have identified a gene homologous to scADAT1 in the region of Drosophila melanogaster Adh chromosome II. Recombinant Drosophila ADAT1 (dADAT1) has been expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and purified. The enzyme has no activity on dsRNA substrates but is a tRNA deaminase with specificity for adenosine 37 of insect alanine tRNA. dADAT1 shows greater similarity to vertebrate ADARs than to yeast Tad1p, supporting the hypothesis of a common evolutionary origin for ADARs and ADATs. dAdat1 transcripts are maternally supplied in the egg.

Genetic and developmental factors in the olfactory response of Drosophila melanogaster larvae to alcohols,1352888,10.1098/rspb.1992.0048,"Olfactory responses of Drosophila melanogaster larvae to a homologous series of primary alcohols (methanol ... decanol) were tested. Alcohols at either extreme of the chain lengths studied (methanol, ethanol and decanol) evoked no significant responses. Heptanol and nonanol both produced dose-independent responses, larvae being attracted to heptanol and repulsed by nonanol. The remaining alcohols elicited dose-related attractive responses. Responses to hexanol and nonanol decline with increasing larval age. Genetic differences were found for the response to heptanol, with larvae from a Japanese strain, Katsunuma, being indifferent to this substance. Chromosome exchange revealed that a major factor involved in the response to heptanol is located on chromosome II; factors on chromosome III quantitatively modulate this response. Three mutant strains were isolated following EMS mutagenesis of chromosome III.

The activated eggs usually produce haploid embryos, but a small fraction (10( -4)-10(-5)) of them give rise to diploid impaternate adults. To know the cytological mechanisms by which these impaternates restore diploidy, the genotypes of impaternate progeny obtained from females doubly heterozygous for visible markers were examined. The results show that, as generally found among parthenogenetic Drosophila, diploidy is restored after completing meiosis either by pronuclear fusion or by gamete duplication (doubling of a haploid cleavage nucleus). The fusion of two nonsister nuclei following meiosis II (central fusion) was indicated to be a predominant mode of diploidization in this species. Two meiotic mutants, mei-9 and mei-S332, which are known to greatly increase meiotic nondisjunction, did not cause an increased incidence of impaternates. This seems to exclude the possibility that some impaternates might have been derived from diploid egg nuclei produced through nondisjunction.",1986,"Y Fuyama, Y Fuyama"
Dual Roles of Glutathione in Ecdysone Biosynthesis and Antioxidant Function During Larval Development in Drosophila,29021278,10.1534/genetics.117.300391,"Ecdysteroids, including the biologically active hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), play essential roles in controlling many developmental and physiological events in insects. Ecdysteroid biosynthesis is achieved by a series of specialized enzymes encoded by the Halloween genes. Recently, a new class of Halloween gene, noppera-bo (nobo), encoding a glutathione S-transferase (GST) in dipteran and lepidopteran species, has been identified and characterized. GSTs are well known to conjugate substrates with the reduced form of glutathione (GSH), a bioactive tripeptide composed of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. We hypothesized that GSH itself is required for ecdysteroid biosynthesis. However, the role of GSH in steroid hormone biosynthesis has not been examined in any organisms. Here, we report phenotypic analysis of a complete loss-of-function mutant in the γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase catalytic subunit (Gclc) gene in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogasterGclc encodes the evolutionarily conserved catalytic component of the enzyme that conjugates glutamate and cysteine in the GSH biosynthesis pathway. Complete Gclc loss-of-function leads to drastic GSH deficiency in the larval body fluid. Gclc mutant animals show a larval-arrest phenotype. Ecdysteroid titer in Gclc mutant larvae decreases, and the larval-arrest phenotype is rescued by oral administration of 20E or cholesterol. Moreover, Gclc mutant animals exhibit abnormal lipid deposition in the prothoracic gland, a steroidogenic organ during larval development. All of these phenotypes are reminiscent to nobo loss-of-function animals. On the other hand, Gclc mutant larvae also exhibit a significant reduction in antioxidant capacity. Consistent with this phenotype, Gclc mutant larvae are more sensitive to oxidative stress response as compared to wild-type. Nevertheless, the ecdysteroid biosynthesis defect in Gclc mutant animals is not associated with loss of antioxidant function.

Drosophila histone locus body assembly and function involves multiple interactions,32401666,10.1091/mbc.E20-03-0176,"The histone locus body (HLB) assembles at replication-dependent (RD) histone loci and concentrates factors required for RD histone mRNA biosynthesis. The Drosophila melanogaster genome has a single locus comprised of ∼100 copies of a tandemly arrayed 5-kB repeat unit containing one copy of each of the 5 RD histone genes. To determine sequence elements required for D. melanogaster HLB formation and histone gene expression, we used transgenic gene arrays containing 12 copies of the histone repeat unit that functionally complement loss of the ∼200 endogenous RD histone genes. A 12x histone gene array in which all H3-H4 promoters were replaced with H2a-H2b promoters (12xPR) does not form an HLB or express high levels of RD histone mRNA in the presence of the endogenous histone genes. In contrast, this same transgenic array is active in HLB assembly and RD histone gene expression in the absence of the endogenous RD histone genes and rescues the lethality caused by homozygous deletion of the RD histone locus. The HLB formed in the absence of endogenous RD histone genes on the mutant 12x array contains all known factors present in the wild-type HLB including CLAMP, which normally binds to GAGA repeats in the H3-H4 promoter. These data suggest that multiple protein-protein and/or protein-DNA interactions contribute to HLB formation, and that the large number of endogenous RD histone gene copies sequester available factor(s) from attenuated transgenic arrays, thereby preventing HLB formation and gene expression on these arrays.",2020,"Kaitlin P Koreski, Leila E Rieder, Lyndsey M McLain, Ashlesha Chaubal, William F Marzluff, Robert J Duronio, Kaitlin P Koreski, Leila E Rieder, Lyndsey M McLain, Ashlesha Chaubal, William F Marzluff, Robert J Duronio"
"The Mammalian Orthologs of Drosophila Lgd, CC2D1A and CC2D1B, Function in the Endocytic Pathway, but Their Individual Loss of Function Does Not Affect Notch Signalling",26720614,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005749,"CC2D1A and CC2D1B belong to the evolutionary conserved Lgd protein family with members in all multi-cellular animals. Several functions such as centrosomal cleavage, involvement in signalling pathways, immune response and synapse maturation have been described for CC2D1A. Moreover, the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog Lgd was shown to be involved in the endosomal trafficking of the Notch receptor and other transmembrane receptors and physically interacts with the ESCRT-III component Shrub/CHMP4. To determine if this function is conserved in mammals we generated and characterized Cc2d1a and Cc2d1b conditional knockout mice. While Cc2d1b deficient mice displayed no obvious phenotype, we found that Cc2d1a deficient mice as well as conditional mutants that lack CC2D1A only in the nervous system die shortly after birth due to respiratory distress. This finding confirms the suspicion that the breathing defect is caused by the central nervous system. However, an involvement in centrosomal function could not be confirmed in Cc2d1a deficient MEF cells. To analyse an influence on Notch signalling, we generated intestine specific Cc2d1a mutant mice. These mice did not display any alterations in goblet cell number, proliferating cell number or expression of the Notch reporter Hes1-emGFP, suggesting that CC2D1A is not required for Notch signalling. However, our EM analysis revealed that the average size of endosomes of Cc2d1a mutant cells, but not Cc2d1b mutant cells, is increased, indicating a defect in endosomal morphogenesis. We could show that CC2D1A and its interaction partner CHMP4B are localised on endosomes in MEF cells, when the activity of the endosomal protein VPS4 is reduced. This indicates that CC2D1A cycles between the cytosol and the endosomal membrane. Additionally, in rescue experiments in D. melanogaster, CC2D1A and CC2D1B were able to functionally replace Lgd.

Genetic basis for developmental homeostasis of germline stem cell niche number: a network of Tramtrack-Group nuclear BTB factors,23185495,10.1371/journal.pone.0049958,"The potential to produce new cells during adult life depends on the number of stem cell niches and the capacity of stem cells to divide, and is therefore under the control of programs ensuring developmental homeostasis. However, it remains generally unknown how the number of stem cell niches is controlled. In the insect ovary, each germline stem cell (GSC) niche is embedded in a functional unit called an ovariole. The number of ovarioles, and thus the number of GSC niches, varies widely among species. In Drosophila, morphogenesis of ovarioles starts in larvae with the formation of terminal filaments (TFs), each made of 8-10 cells that pile up and sort in stacks. TFs constitute organizers of individual germline stem cell niches during larval and early pupal development. In the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup, the number of ovarioles varies interspecifically from 8 to 20. Here we show that pipsqueak, Trithorax-like, batman and the bric-à-brac (bab) locus, all encoding nuclear BTB/POZ factors of the Tramtrack Group, are involved in limiting the number of ovarioles in D. melanogaster. At least two different processes are differentially perturbed by reducing the function of these genes. We found that when the bab dose is reduced, sorting of TF cells into TFs was affected such that each TF contains fewer cells and more TFs are formed. In contrast, psq mutants exhibited a greater number of TF cells per ovary, with a normal number of cells per TF, thereby leading to formation of more TFs per ovary than in the wild type.

Hitchhiking effects of recurrent beneficial amino acid substitutions in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,17989248,10.1101/gr.6691007,"Several recent studies have estimated that a large fraction of amino acid divergence between species of Drosophila was fixed by positive selection, using statistical approaches based on the McDonald-Kreitman test. However, little is known about associated selection coefficients of beneficial amino acid mutations. Recurrent selective sweeps associated with adaptive substitutions should leave a characteristic signature in genome variability data that contains information about the frequency and strength of selection. Here, I document a significant negative correlation between the level and the frequency of synonymous site polymorphism and the rate of protein evolution in highly recombining regions of the X chromosome of D. melanogaster. This pattern is predicted by recurrent adaptive protein evolution and suggests that adaptation is an important determinant of patterns of neutral variation genome-wide. Using a maximum likelihood approach, I estimate the product of the rate and strength of selection under a recurrent genetic hitchhiking model, lambda2N(e)s approximately 3 x 10(-8). Using an approach based on the McDonald-Kreitman test, I estimate that approximately 50% of divergent amino acids were driven to fixation by positive selection, implying that beneficial amino acid substitutions are of weak effect on average, on the order of 10(-5) (i.e., 2N(e)s approximately 40).

(2) Pairs of genes that have intimate phylogenetic relationship are frequently found in proximity on the same chromosome. (3) Some of the Na,K- and H,K-ATPase isoforms in D. melanogaster and C. elegans lack motifs shown to be important for alpha/beta-subunit assembly, suggesting that such alpha- and beta-subunits might exist by themselves (lonely subunits). The mutation rates for these subunits are much faster than those for the subunits with recognizable assembly domains.

Drosophila Jun mediates Ras-dependent photoreceptor determination,7923366,10.1016/0092-8674(94)90273-9,"The expression of the D. melanogaster transcription factor Jun in the eye imaginal disc correlates temporally and spatially with the determination of neuronal photoreceptor fate. Expression of dominant negative forms of Jun in photoreceptor precursor cells results in dose-dependent loss of photoreceptors in the adult fly. Conversely, localized overexpression of Jun in the eye imaginal disc can induce the differentiation of additional photoreceptor cells. Furthermore, the transformation of nonneuronal cone cells into R7 neurons elicited by constitutively active forms of sevenless, Ras1, Raf, and MAP kinase is relieved in the presence of Jun mutants. These results demonstrate a requirement of Jun downstream of the sevenless/ras signaling pathway for neuronal development in the Drosophila eye.",1994,"D Bohmann, M C Ellis, L M Staszewski, M Mlodzik, D Bohmann, M C Ellis, L M Staszewski, M Mlodzik"
A highly polymorphic region in the X chromosome of Drosophila,2823070,10.1007/BF00329861,"Many cloned regions of the Drosophila genome show minimal variation between strains in overall sequence arrangement. While restriction site polymorphisms occur and the location of transposable elements may vary from one strain to another, such changes appear to be relatively minor variations superimposed on overall genome stability. In contrast to this general situation, we describe here a segment of the X chromosome that is highly polymorphic in four strains of D. melanogaster and in D. simulans. The strains differ in the presence and extent of a short duplication and the presence of repetitive DNA. These results suggest that different regions of the genome may be subject to different evolutionary constraints, with some regions being particularly prone to extensive changes, even within a single species.",1987,"S R Haynes, I B Dawid, S R Haynes, I B Dawid"
AANAT1 functions in astrocytes to regulate sleep homeostasis,32955431,10.7554/eLife.53994,"How the brain controls the need and acquisition of recovery sleep after prolonged wakefulness is an important issue in sleep research. The monoamines serotonin and dopamine are key regulators of sleep in mammals and in Drosophila. We found that the enzyme arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (AANAT1) is expressed by Drosophila astrocytes and specific subsets of neurons in the adult brain. AANAT1 acetylates monoamines and inactivates them, and we found that AANAT1 limited the accumulation of serotonin and dopamine in the brain upon sleep deprivation. Loss of AANAT1 from astrocytes, but not from neurons, caused flies to increase their daytime recovery sleep following overnight sleep deprivation. Together, these findings demonstrate a crucial role for AANAT1 and astrocytes in the regulation of monoamine bioavailability and homeostatic sleep.",2020,"Sejal Davla, Gregory Artiushin, Yongjun Li, Daryan Chitsaz, Sally Li, Amita Sehgal, Donald J van Meyel, Sejal Davla, Gregory Artiushin, Yongjun Li, Daryan Chitsaz, Sally Li, Amita Sehgal, Donald J van Meyel"
CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION IN HAWAIIAN DROSOPHILA,28564908,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1993.tb02163.x,"We are interested in elucidating the extent to which lekking Hawaiian Drosophila species have diverged from their continental counterparts, which engage in sexual behavior at communal food sources, with regard to the chemical communication systems that the flies employ. Accordingly, we have analyzed flies from three closely related Hawaiian Drosophila species in the adiastola subgroup. These species are of interest because the males engage in a unique behavior: while courting, they raise their abdomens over their heads and emit anal droplets. Analysis of the flies' behavior, the hydrocarbons in males' anal droplets, and males' cuticular hydrocarbons suggest that females' responses to males may be mediated by cuticular pheromones and/or pheromones in males' extruded droplets that enable the females to distinguish conspecific from heterospeciflc males. Conversely, perception of cuticular hydrocarbons from conspecific females enables D. adiastola males to distinguish females from a closely related species from conspecific females. On the basis of these observations, we suggest that the adiastola subgroup species are unique among drosophilids in that they utilize an anal droplet-mediated pheromone communication system, some or all components of which are species specific. However, the lekking Hawaiian Drosophila species are similar to D. melanogaster and related continental species in that the Hawaiian flies employ a cuticular pheromone communication system, some components of which are sex and species-specific.",1993,"Laurie Tompkins, Scott P McRobert, Kenneth Y Kaneshiro, Laurie Tompkins, Scott P McRobert, Kenneth Y Kaneshiro"

Although the five nearctic species differ from all other Drosophila species of the D. obscura group so far studied in the number of loci as well as in the chromosomal distribution and location of the actin loci, the uniformity of the main pattern with six actin loci throughout the genus Drosophila reinforces the hypothesis that the chromosomal elements have maintained their essential identities during the course of evolution.

Analysis and recognition of the GAGA transcription factor binding sites in Drosophila genes,22099633,10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2011.10.008,"The transcription factor GAGA, encoded by the gene Trl, controls expression of many Drosophila melanogaster genes. We have compiled the presently largest sample (120 sites) of published nucleotide sequences with experimentally confirmed binding to GAGA protein. Analysis of the sample has demonstrated that despite an apparent structural diversity of the GAGA sites, they fall into four distinct groups, namely, (1) the sites containing two GAG trinucleotides with no more than one nucleotide substitution in each and separated by spacers with a length of 1 or 3 nucleotides (GAGnGAG and GAGnnnGAG); (2) the sites containing a single GAGAG motif; (3) (GA)(3-9) microsatellite repeats; and (4) the sites corresponding to three and more direct repeats of GAG trinucleotide homolog and its inverted repeats separated by spacers of various lengths. Using the software package SITECON, the methods were elaborated for recognizing the sites of GAGnGAG (method 1) and GAGnnnGAG (method 2) types in DNA sequences. Experimental verification confirmed the ability to interact with the GAGA factor for 72% of the sites predicted using method 1 and 94.5% of the sites predicted by method 2. Application of the experimentally verified methods to analyzing the localization of potential GAGA binding sites in the target genes of this transcription factor has demonstrated that the 5'-untranslated regions (5'UTRs) and first introns are enriched for these sites (two-threefold relative to the average occurrence frequency in the D. melanogaster genome) as compared with a moderate enrichment (not exceeding 1.5-fold) of promoter regions (-4000/+200 bp or -1000/+100 bp).",2011,"E S Omelina, E M Baricheva, D Yu Oshchepkov, T I Merkulova, E S Omelina, E M Baricheva, D Yu Oshchepkov, T I Merkulova"
Vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamylcarboxylation: an ancient posttranslational modification,18374194,10.1016/S0083-6729(07)00008-8,"The vitamin K-dependent carboxylase carries out the posttranslational modification of specific glutamate residues in proteins to gamma-carboxy glutamic acid (Gla) in the presence of reduced vitamin K, molecular oxygen, and carbon dioxide. In the process, reduced vitamin K is converted to vitamin K epoxide, which is subsequently reduced to vitamin K, by vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) for use in the carboxylation reaction. The modification has a wide range of physiological implications, including hemostasis, bone calcification, and signal transduction. The enzyme interacts with a high affinity gamma-carboxylation recognition sequence (gamma-CRS) of the substrate and carries out multiple modifications of the substrate before the product is released. This mechanism ensures complete carboxylation of the Gla domain of the coagulation factors, which is essential for their biological activity. gamma-Carboxylation, originally discovered in mammals, is widely distributed in the animal kingdom. It has been characterized in sea squirt (Ciona intestinalis), in flies (Drosophila melanogaster), and in marine snails (Conus textile), none of which have a blood coagulation system similar to mammals. The cone snails express a large array of gamma-carboxylated peptides that modulate the activity of ion channels. These findings have led to the suggestion that gamma-carboxylation is an extracellular posttranslational modification that antedates the divergence of molluscs, arthropods, and chordates. I will first summarize recent understanding of gamma-carboxylase and gamma-carboxylation gleaned from experiments using the mammalian enzyme, and then I will briefly describe the available information on gamma-carboxylation in D. melanogaster and C. textile.",2008,"Pradip K Bandyopadhyay, Pradip K Bandyopadhyay"
Architectural arrangement of cloned proximal sequence element-binding protein subunits on Drosophila U1 and U6 snRNA gene promoters,14966271,10.1128/mcb.24.5.1897-1906.2004,"Transcription of snRNA genes by either RNA polymerase II (U1 to U5) or RNA polymerase III (U6) is dependent upon a proximal sequence element (PSE) located approximately 40 to 60 bp upstream of the transcription start site. In Drosophila melanogaster, RNA polymerase specificity is determined by as few as three nucleotide differences within the otherwise well-conserved 21-bp PSE. Previous photo-cross-linking studies revealed that the D. melanogaster PSE-binding protein, DmPBP, contains three subunits (DmPBP45, DmPBP49, and DmPBP95) that associate with the DNA to form complexes that are conformationally distinct depending upon whether the protein is bound to a U1 or a U6 PSE. We have identified and cloned the genes that code for these subunits of DmPBP by virtue of their similarity to three of the five subunits of SNAP(c), the human PBP. When expressed in S2 cells, each of the three cloned gene products is incorporated into a protein complex that functionally binds to a PSE. We also find that the conformational difference referred to above is particularly pronounced for DmPBP45, herein identified as the ortholog of human SNAP43. DmPBP45 cross-linked strongly to DNA for two turns of the DNA helix downstream of the U1 PSE, but it cross-linked strongly for only a half turn of the helix downstream of a U6 PSE. These substantial differences in the cross-linking pattern are consistent with those of a model in which conformational differences in DmPBP-DNA complexes lead to selective RNA polymerase recruitment to U1 and U6 promoters.",2004,"Cheng Li, Gale A Harding, Jason Parise, Kathleen J McNamara-Schroeder, William E Stumph, Cheng Li, Gale A Harding, Jason Parise, Kathleen J McNamara-Schroeder, William E Stumph"
Small RNA populations revealed by blocking rRNA fragments in Drosophila melanogaster reproductive tissues,29474379,10.1371/journal.pone.0191966,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a complex and highly conserved regulatory mechanism mediated via small RNAs (sRNAs). Recent technical advances in high throughput sequencing have enabled an increasingly detailed analysis of sRNA abundances and profiles in specific body parts and tissues. This enables investigations of the localized roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). However, variation in the proportions of non-coding RNAs in the samples being compared can hinder these analyses. Specific tissues may vary significantly in the proportions of fragments of longer non-coding RNAs (such as ribosomal RNA or transfer RNA) present, potentially reflecting tissue-specific differences in biological functions. For example, in Drosophila, some tissues contain a highly abundant 30nt rRNA fragment (the 2S rRNA) as well as abundant 5' and 3' terminal rRNA fragments. These can pose difficulties for the construction of sRNA libraries as they can swamp the sequencing space and obscure sRNA abundances. Here we addressed this problem and present a modified ""rRNA blocking"" protocol for the construction of high-definition (HD) adapter sRNA libraries, in D. melanogaster reproductive tissues. The results showed that 2S rRNAs targeted by blocking oligos were reduced from >80% to < 0.01% total reads. In addition, the use of multiple rRNA blocking oligos to bind the most abundant rRNA fragments allowed us to reveal the underlying sRNA populations at increased resolution. Side-by-side comparisons of sequencing libraries of blocked and non-blocked samples revealed that rRNA blocking did not change the miRNA populations present, but instead enhanced their abundances. We suggest that this rRNA blocking procedure offers the potential to improve the in-depth analysis of differentially expressed sRNAs within and across different tissues.",2018,"Emily K Fowler, Irina Mohorianu, Damian T Smith, Tamas Dalmay, Tracey Chapman, Emily K Fowler, Irina Mohorianu, Damian T Smith, Tamas Dalmay, Tracey Chapman"
The Insulin-Like Proteins dILPs-2/5 Determine Diapause Inducibility in Drosophila,27689881,10.1371/journal.pone.0163680,"Diapause is an actively induced dormancy that has evolved in Metazoa to resist environmental stresses. In temperate regions, many diapausing insects overwinter at low temperatures by blocking embryonic, larval or adult development. Despite its Afro-tropical origin, Drosophila melanogaster migrated to temperate regions of Asia and Europe where females overwinter as adults by arresting gonadal development (reproductive diapause) at temperatures <13°C. Recent work in D. melanogaster has implicated the developmental hormones dILPs-2 and/or dILP3, and dILP5, homologues of vertebrate insulin/insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), in reproductive arrest. However, polymorphisms in timeless (tim) and couch potato (cpo) dramatically affect diapause inducibility and these dILP experiments could not exclude this common genetic variation contributing to the diapause phenotype. Here, we apply an extensive genetic dissection of the insulin signaling pathway which allows us to see both enhancements and reductions in egg development that are independent of tim and cpo variations. We show that a number of manipulations dramatically enhance diapause to ~100%. These include ablating, or reducing the excitability of the insulin-producing cells (IPCs) that express dILPs-2,3,5 employing the dilp2,3,5-/- triple mutant, desensitizing insulin signaling using a chico mutation, or inhibiting dILP2 and 5 in the hemolymph by over-expressing Imaginal Morphogenesis Protein-Late 2 (Imp-L2). In addition, triple mutant dilp2,3,5-/- females maintain high levels of diapause even when temperatures are raised in adulthood to 19°C. However at 22°C, these females all show egg development revealing that the effects are conditional on temperature and not a general female sterility. In contrast, over-expression of dilps-2/5 or enhancing IPC excitability, led to levels of ovarian arrest that approached zero, underscoring dILPs-2 and 5 as key antagonists of diapause.",2016,"Luca Schiesari, Gabriele Andreatta, Charalambos P Kyriacou, Michael B O'Connor, Rodolfo Costa, Luca Schiesari, Gabriele Andreatta, Charalambos P Kyriacou, Michael B O'Connor, Rodolfo Costa"
Genome-Wide Comparative Analysis of Chemosensory Gene Families in Five Tsetse Fly Species,26886411,10.1371/journal.pntd.0004421,"For decades, odour-baited traps have been used for control of tsetse flies (Diptera; Glossinidae), vectors of African trypanosomes. However, differential responses to known attractants have been reported in different Glossina species, hindering establishment of a universal vector control tool. Availability of full genome sequences of five Glossina species offers an opportunity to compare their chemosensory repertoire and enhance our understanding of their biology in relation to chemosensation. Here, we identified and annotated the major chemosensory gene families in Glossina. We identified a total of 118, 115, 124, and 123 chemosensory genes in Glossina austeni, G. brevipalpis, G. f. fuscipes, G. pallidipes, respectively, relative to 127 reported in G. m. morsitans. Our results show that tsetse fly genomes have fewer chemosensory genes when compared to other dipterans such as Musca domestica (n>393), Drosophila melanogaster (n = 246) and Anopheles gambiae (n>247). We also found that Glossina chemosensory genes are dispersed across distantly located scaffolds in their respective genomes, in contrast to other insects like D. melanogaster whose genes occur in clusters. Further, Glossina appears to be devoid of sugar receptors and to have expanded CO2 associated receptors, potentially reflecting Glossina's obligate hematophagy and the need to detect hosts that may be out of sight. We also identified, in all species, homologs of Ir84a; a Drosophila-specific ionotropic receptor that promotes male courtship suggesting that this is a conserved trait in tsetse flies. Notably, our selection analysis revealed that a total of four gene loci (Gr21a, GluRIIA, Gr28b, and Obp83a) were under positive selection, which confers fitness advantage to species.

Mapping of the Sequences Directing Localization of the Drosophila Germ Cell-Expressed Protein (GCE),26186223,10.1371/journal.pone.0133307,"Drosophila melanogaster germ cell-expressed protein (GCE) belongs to the family of bHLH-PAS transcription factors that are the regulators of gene expression networks that determine many physiological and developmental processes. GCE is a homolog of D. melanogaster methoprene tolerant protein (MET), a key mediator of anti-metamorphic signaling in insects and the putative juvenile hormone receptor. Recently, it has been shown that the functions of MET and GCE are only partially redundant and tissue specific. The ability of bHLH-PAS proteins to fulfill their function depends on proper intracellular trafficking, determined by specific sequences, i.e. the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and the nuclear export signal (NES). Nevertheless, until now no data has been published on the GCE intracellular shuttling and localization signals. We performed confocal microscopy analysis of the subcellular distribution of GCE fused with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and YFP-GCE derivatives which allowed us to characterize the details of the subcellular traffic of this protein. We demonstrate that GCE possess specific pattern of localization signals, only partially consistent with presented previously for MET. The presence of a strong NLS in the C-terminal part of GCE, seems to be unique and important feature of this protein. The intracellular localization of GCE appears to be determined by the NLSs localized in PAS-B domain and C-terminal fragment of GCE, and NESs localized in PAS-A, PAS-B domains and C-terminal fragment of GCE.

The effects of purifying selection on patterns of genetic differentiation between Drosophila melanogaster populations,25227256,10.1038/hdy.2014.80,"Using the data provided by the Drosophila Population Genomics Project, we investigate factors that affect the genetic differentiation between Rwandan and French populations of D. melanogaster. By examining within-population polymorphisms, we show that sites in long introns (especially those >2000 bp) have significantly lower π (nucleotide diversity) and more low-frequency variants (as measured by Tajima's D, minor allele frequencies, and prevalence of variants that are private to one of the two populations) than short introns, suggesting a positive relationship between intron length and selective constraint. A similar analysis of protein-coding polymorphisms shows that 0-fold (degenerate) sites in more conserved genes are under stronger purifying selection than those in less conserved genes. There is limited evidence that selection on codon bias has an effect on differentiation (as measured by FST) at 4-fold (degenerate) sites, and 4-fold sites and sites in 8-30 bp of short introns ⩽65 bp have comparable FST values. Consistent with the expected effect of purifying selection, sites in long introns and 0-fold sites in conserved genes are less differentiated than those in short introns and less conserved genes, respectively. Genes in non-crossover regions (for example, the fourth chromosome) have very high FST values at both 0-fold and 4-fold degenerate sites, which is probably because of the large reduction in within-population diversity caused by tight linkage between many selected sites. Our analyses also reveal subtle statistical properties of FST, which arise when information from multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms is combined and can lead to the masking of important signals of selection.",2015,"B C Jackson, J L Campos, K Zeng, B C Jackson, J L Campos, K Zeng"
Residue-specific annotation of disorder-to-order transition and cathepsin inhibition of a propeptide-like crammer from D. melanogaster,23349821,10.1371/journal.pone.0054187,"Drosophila melanogaster crammer is a novel cathepsin inhibitor involved in long-term memory formation. A molten globule-to-ordered structure transition is required for cathepsin inhibition. This study reports the use of alanine scanning to probe the critical residues in the two hydrophobic cores and the salt bridges of crammer in the context of disorder-to-order transition and cathepsin inhibition. Alanine substitution of the aromatic residues W9, Y12, F16, Y20, Y32, and W53 within the hydrophobic cores, and charged residues E8, R28, R29, and E67 in the salt bridges considerably decrease the ability of crammer to inhibit Drosophila cathepsin B (CTSB). Far-UV circular dichroism (CD), intrinsic fluorescence, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies show that removing most of the aromatic and charged side-chains substantially reduces thermostability, alters pH-dependent helix formation, and disrupts the molten globule-to-ordered structure transition. Molecular modeling indicates that W53 in the hydrophobic Core 2 is essential for the interaction between crammer and the prosegment binding loop (PBL) of CTSB; the salt bridge between R28 and E67 is critical for the appropriate alignment of the α-helix 4 toward the CTSB active cleft. The results of this study show detailed residue-specific dissection of folding transition and functional contributions of the hydrophobic cores and salt bridges in crammer, which have hitherto not been characterized for cathepsin inhibition by propeptide-like cysteine protease inhibitors.

A transcriptional network associated with natural variation in Drosophila aggressive behavior,19607677,10.1186/gb-2009-10-7-r76,"Background:
      
    

    
      Aggressive behavior is an important component of fitness in most animals. Aggressive behavior is genetically complex, with natural variation attributable to multiple segregating loci with allelic effects that are sensitive to the physical and social environment. However, we know little about the genes and genetic networks affecting natural variation in aggressive behavior. Populations of Drosophila melanogaster harbor quantitative genetic variation in aggressive behavior, providing an excellent model system for dissecting the genetic basis of naturally occurring variation in aggression.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Correlating variation in transcript abundance with variation in complex trait phenotypes is a rapid method for identifying candidate genes. We quantified aggressive behavior in 40 wild-derived inbred lines of D. melanogaster and performed a genome-wide association screen for quantitative trait transcripts and single feature polymorphisms affecting aggression. We identified 266 novel candidate genes associated with aggressive behavior, many of which have pleiotropic effects on metabolism, development, and/or other behavioral traits. We performed behavioral tests of mutations in 12 of these candidate genes, and show that nine indeed affected aggressive behavior. We used the genetic correlations among the quantitative trait transcripts to derive a transcriptional genetic network associated with natural variation in aggressive behavior. The network consists of nine modules of correlated transcripts that are enriched for genes affecting common functions, tissue-specific expression patterns, and/or DNA sequence motifs.

SWI/SNF associates with nascent pre-mRNPs and regulates alternative pre-mRNA processing,19424417,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000470,"The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes regulate the transcription of many genes by remodeling nucleosomes at promoter regions. In Drosophila, SWI/SNF plays an important role in ecdysone-dependent transcription regulation. Studies in human cells suggest that Brahma (Brm), the ATPase subunit of SWI/SNF, regulates alternative pre-mRNA splicing by modulating transcription elongation rates. We describe, here, experiments that study the association of Brm with transcribed genes in Chironomus tentans and Drosophila melanogaster, the purpose of which was to further elucidate the mechanisms by which Brm regulates pre-mRNA processing. We show that Brm becomes incorporated into nascent Balbiani ring pre-mRNPs co-transcriptionally and that the human Brm and Brg1 proteins are associated with RNPs. We have analyzed the expression profiles of D. melanogaster S2 cells in which the levels of individual SWI/SNF subunits have been reduced by RNA interference, and we show that depletion of SWI/SNF core subunits changes the relative abundance of alternative transcripts from a subset of genes. This observation, and the fact that a fraction of Brm is not associated with chromatin but with nascent pre-mRNPs, suggest that SWI/SNF affects pre-mRNA processing by acting at the RNA level. Ontology enrichment tests indicate that the genes that are regulated post-transcriptionally by SWI/SNF are mostly enzymes and transcription factors that regulate postembryonic developmental processes. In summary, the data suggest that SWI/SNF becomes incorporated into nascent pre-mRNPs and acts post-transcriptionally to regulate not only the amount of mRNA synthesized from a given promoter but also the type of alternative transcript produced.",2009,"Anu Tyagi, Jessica Ryme, David Brodin, Ann Kristin Ostlund Farrants, Neus Visa, Anu Tyagi, Jessica Ryme, David Brodin, Ann Kristin Ostlund Farrants, Neus Visa"
Localization of sequences regulating ancestral and acquired sites of esterase6 activity in Drosophila melanogaster,8754215,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025639,"We have broadly defined the DNA regions regulating esterase6 activity in several life stages and tissue types of D. melanogaster using P-element-mediated transformation of constructs that contain the esterase6 coding region and deletions or substitutions in 5' or 3' flanking DNA. Hemolymph is a conserved ancestral site of EST6 activity in Drosophila and the primary sequences regulating its activity lie between -171 and -25 bp relative to the translation initiation site: deletion of these sequences decrease activity approximately 20-fold. Hemolymph activity is also modulated by four other DNA regions, three of which lie 5' and one of which lies 3' of the coding region. Of these, two have positive and two have negative effects, each of approximately twofold. Esterase6 activity is present also in two male reproductive tract tissues; the ejaculatory bulb, which is another ancestral activity site, and the ejaculatory duct, which is a recently acquired site within the melanogaster species subgroup. Activities in these tissues are at least in part independently regulated: activity in the ejaculatory bulb is conferred by sequences between -273 and -172 bp (threefold decrease when deleted), while activity in the ejaculatory duct is conferred by more distal sequences between -844 and -614 bp (fourfold decrease when deleted). The reproductive tract activity is further modulated by two additional DNA regions, one in 5' DNA (-613 to -284 bp; threefold decrease when deleted) and the other in 3' DNA (+1860 to +2731 bp; threefold decrease when deleted) that probably overlaps the adjacent esteraseP gene. Collating these data with previous studies suggests that expression of EST6 in the ancestral sites is mainly regulated by conserved proximal sequences while more variable distal sequences regulate expression in the acquired ejaculatory duct site.",1996,"M J Healy, M M Dumancic, A Cao, J G Oakeshott, M J Healy, M M Dumancic, A Cao, J G Oakeshott"
Genetic control of imaginal disc development in Drosophila,4208549,10.1073/pnas.71.4.1393,"Many of the functions required for formation of the imaginal discs of Drosophila melanogaster larvae, from which adult structures are derived, are disc-specific and not required for formation of other larval tissues. Mutants blocked in disc-specific functions can produce mature viable larvae, indicating that larval development is not dependent on concomitant disc development. Some of the mutant larvae have no detectable discs (discless mutants), and other have small discs that cannot differentiate into adult structures (small disc mutants). From the results of genetic complementation and mapping experiments with such mutants, it was estimated that the genome of D. melanogaster contains around a thousand complementation groups, or about a fifth of all complementation groups in the genome, that are essential specifically for the development of all the discs. The developmental defects in some of the disc mutants appear to involve autonomous functions of the imaginal cells, and in other mutants functions provided by the larval environment to support disc development. This distinction was made on the basis of two functional tests. The purpose of one of the tests was to detect the presence in young embryos of determined imaginal cells capable of differentiating after transplantation to a wild-type host; the other test measured the capacity of early third-instar larvae to act as hosts for the further development of immature discs transplanted from a wild-type donor. Three discless mutants that were tested in this way appeared to be defective in autonomous functions of the imaginal cells, since the embryos contained no imaginal cells that could be detected in the first test, whereas the larvae, although devoid of discs, showed a normal capacity to support disc development in the second test. One of the small disc mutants tested was defective in a larval rather than an imaginal cell function, since the embryos had a normal complement of functional imaginal cells, whereas the larvae were incapable of supporting disc development. Thus, both types of disc-specific functions are essential for normal disc development.",1974,"A Shearn, A Garen, A Shearn, A Garen"
Genome-wide transcriptional effects of deletions of sulphur metabolism genes in Drosophila melanogaster,32769010,10.1016/j.redox.2020.101654,"In recent years, the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulphide (H2S), produced by the transsulphuration pathway, has been recognized as a biological mediator playing an important role under normal conditions and in various pathologies in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The transsulphuration pathway (TSP) includes the conversion of homocysteine to cysteine following the breakdown of methionine. In Drosophila melanogaster and other eukaryotes, H2S is produced by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulphurtransferase (MST). In the experiments performed in this study, we were able to explore the CRISPR/Cas9 technique to obtain single and double deletions in homozygotes of these three major genes responsible for H2S production in Drosophila melanogaster. In most cases, the deletion of one studied gene does not result in the compensatory induction of two other genes responsible for H2S production. Transcriptomic studies demonstrated that the deletions of the above CBS and CSE genes alter genome expression to different degrees, with a more pronounced effect being exerted by deletion of the CBS gene. Furthermore, the double deletion of both CBS and CSE resulted in a cumulative effect on transcription in the resulting strains. Overall, we found that the obtained deletions affect numerous genes involved in various biological pathways. Specifically, genes involved in the oxidative reduction process, stress-response genes, housekeeping genes, and genes participating in olfactory and reproduction are among the most strongly affected. Furthermore, characteristic differences in the response to the deletions of the studied genes are apparently organ-specific and have clear-cut sex-specific characteristics. Single and double deletions of the three genes responsible for the production of H2S helped to elucidate new aspects of the biological significance of this vital physiological mediator.",2020,"O Zatsepina, D Karpov, L Chuvakova, A Rezvykh, S Funikov, S Sorokina, A Zakluta, D Garbuz, V Shilova, M Evgen'ev, O Zatsepina, D Karpov, L Chuvakova, A Rezvykh, S Funikov, S Sorokina, A Zakluta, D Garbuz, V Shilova, M Evgen'ev"
Hormetic efficacy of rutin to promote longevity in Drosophila melanogaster,28389882,10.1007/s10522-017-9700-1,"Hormetins are compounds that mediate hormesis by being beneficial at low doses but detrimental at high doses. Recent studies have highlighted that many compounds that extended lifespan in model organisms did so by mediating hormesis. Rutin is a glycosylate conjugate of quercetin and rutinose and is abundant in citrus fruits and buckwheat seeds. Rutin possess ROS scavenging, anti-cancer, cardio-protective, skin-regenerative and neuro-protective properties. Drosophila melanogaster is an attractive model organism for longevity studies owing to its homology of organ and cellular-pathways with mammals. In this study, we aimed to understand the effect of rutin on extending longevity in Drosophila melanogaster. Male and female flies were administered with a range of rutin doses (100-800 µM) to analyse whether rutin mediated lifespan-extension by hormesis. Effect of rutin on physiological parameters like food intake, fecundity, climbing activity, development and resistance to various stresses was also studied. Lifespan assays showed that rutin at 200 and 400 µM significantly extended median lifespan in both male and female flies beyond which flies exhibited drastically reduced longevity. Increase in survival at 400 µM was associated with reduced food intake and fecundity. Flies exhibited improved climbing capability with both 200 and 400 µM rutin. Flies fed with 100 and 200 µM rutin exhibited enhanced survival upon exposure to oxidative stress with 400 µM rutin exhibiting no improvement in median lifespan following oxidative stress. Analysis of endogenous peroxide upon treatment with rutin (100-400 µM) with or without 5% H2O2 showed elevated levels of endogenous peroxide with 400 µM rutin whereas no increase in hydrogen peroxide level was observed with rutin at 100 and 200 µM. Finally, gene expression studies in male flies revealed that rutin treatment at 200 and/or 400 µM elevated transcript levels of dFoxO, MnSod, Cat, dTsc1, dTsc2, Thor, dAtg1, dAtg5 and dAtg7 and reduced transcript levels of dTor. Collectively, rutin at 200 and 400 µM improved longevity in flies; 200 µM rutin acted as a mild stressor to prolong lifespan in flies by mediating hormesis whereas 400 µM, being a high dose for best positive effects.",2017,"Debarati Chattopadhyay, Atith Chitnis, Aishwarya Talekar, Prajakta Mulay, Manyata Makkar, Joel James, Kavitha Thirumurugan, Debarati Chattopadhyay, Atith Chitnis, Aishwarya Talekar, Prajakta Mulay, Manyata Makkar, Joel James, Kavitha Thirumurugan"
Microgravity effects on the oogenesis and development of embryos of Drosophila melanogaster laid in the Spaceshuttle during the Biorack experiment (ESA),2518159,,"The results obtained during the last successful flight of the Challenger Shuttle, in early November 1985, indicate that oogenesis and embryonic development of Drosophila melanogaster are altered in the absence of gravity. Two hundred forty females and ninety males, wild type Oregon R Drosophila melanogaster flies were flown in the Spaceshuttle during the 7-day D-1 mission and the embryos laid during the spaceflight were recovered and studied. Although some eggs developed into normal 1st instar larvae and many into late embryos in the 23 +/- 2 h collection periods throughout the flight, several interesting differences from the parallel ground and in-flight centrifuge controls were observed: 1) There was an increase in oocyte production and size. 2) There was a significant decrease in the number of larvae hatched from the embryonic cuticles in microgravity. 3) The majority of embryos were normally fertilized and at late stages of development, except in the space-flown containers in microgravity where a percentage of earlier stage embryos were recovered showing alterations in the deposition of yolk. 4) In correspondence with these results, at least 25% of the living embryos recovered from space failed to develop into adults. 5) Studies of the larval cuticles and those of the late embryos indicate the existence of alterations in the anterior, head and thoracic regions of the animals. 6) There was a delay in the development into adults of the embryos and larvae that had been subjected to microgravity and recovered from the space shuttle at the end of the flight. No significant accumulation of lethal mutations in any of the experimental conditions was detected as measured through the male to female ratio in the descendant generation. It seems that Drosophila melanogaster flies are able to sense and respond to the absence of gravity, changing several developmental processes even in very short space flights. The results suggest an interference with the distribution and/or deposition of the maternal components involved in the specification of the anterioposterior axis of the embryo.",1989,"I Vernós, J González-Jurado, M Calleja, R Marco, I Vernós, J González-Jurado, M Calleja, R Marco"
RNA editing of a Drosophila sodium channel gene,10414281,10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb11273.x,"Extensive analysis of cDNAs from the para locus in D. melanogaster reveals posttranscriptional modifications indicative of adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing. Most of these edits occur in highly conserved regions of the Na+ channel, and they occur in distant relatives of D. melanogaster as well. Sequence comparison between species has identified putative cis-acting elements important for each RNA editing site. Double-stranded RNA secondary structures with striking similarity to known RNA editing sites were generated based on these data. In addition, the RNA editing sites appear to be developmentally regulated. We have cloned a potential RNA editase, DRED, with a high degree of homology to the mammalian RED1,2 genes.

Identification of residues involved in the specificity and regulation of the highly efficient multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase from Drosophila melanogaster,10966789,10.1006/jmbi.2000.3990,"In contrast to all known deoxyribonucleoside kinases, a single highly efficient deoxyribonucleoside kinase from Drosophila melanogaster (Dm-dNK) is able to phosphorylate all precursor nucleosides for DNA synthesis. Dm-dNK was mutated in vitro by high-frequency random mutagenesis, expressed in the thymidine kinase-deficient Escherichia coli strain KY895 and clones were selected for sensitivity to the nucleoside analogs 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (AraC, Cytarabine), 3'-azido-2', 3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT, Zidovudine, Retrovir, 2', 3'-dideoxyadenosine (ddA) and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC, Zalcitabine, Hivid. Thirteen mutants with increased sensitivity compared to the wild-type Dm-dNK were isolated from a relatively small pool of less than 10,000 clones. Eight mutant Dm-dNKs increased the sensitivity of KY895 to more than one analog, and two of these mutants even to all four nucleoside analogs. Surprisingly, the mutations did not map to the five regions which are highly conserved among deoxyribonucleoside kinases. The molecular background of improved sensitivity was characterized for the double-mutant MuD (N45D, N64D), where the LD(100) value of transformed KY895 decreased 316-fold for AZT and more than 11-fold for ddC when compared to wild-type Dm-dNK. Purified recombinant MuD displayed higher K(m) values for the native substrates than wild-type Dm-dNK and the V(max) values were substantially lower. On the other hand, the K(m) and V(max) values for AZT and the K(m) value for ddC were nearly unchanged between MuD and wild-type Dm-dNK. Additionally, a decrease in feedback inhibition of MuD by thymidine triphosphate (TTP) was found. This study demonstrates how high-frequency mutagenesis combined with a parallel selection for desired properties provides an insight into the structure-function relationships of the multisubstrate kinase from D. melanogaster. At the same time these mutant enzymes exhibit properties useful in biotechnological and medical applications.",2000,"W Knecht, B Munch-Petersen, J Piskur, W Knecht, B Munch-Petersen, J Piskur"
Immunocytochemical electron microscopic study and Western blot analysis of troponin in striated muscle of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and in several muscle cell types of the earthworm Eisenia foetida,8808389,10.1002/(SICI)1097-0185(199602)244:2<148::AID-AR2>3.0.CO;2-Y,"Background:
      
    

    
      There is little information about troponin in invertebrate muscles, and no previous references to this protein in annelid muscles have been found. The aim of this paper was to study the presence and distribution of troponin in different muscle cell types from the earthworm Eisenia foetida (the muscular body wall, and the inner and outer muscular layer of the pseudoheart). These results were compared with those obtained in the transversely striated muscle of Drosophila melanogaster and in skeletal and smooth muscles of the mouse.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Immunocytochemical electron microscopic study and Western blot analysis using anti-TnT antibodies were employed in this study.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Troponin immunoreaction was detected in the mouse skeletal muscle, the fly flight muscle, and earthworm obliquely striated muscles (body wall musculature and inner muscular layer of the pseudoheart). Immunolabeling for TnT in all these muscle cells appeared in moderate amounts at any point along the sarcomere length, except for the central zone of the A band (H band). This suggests that troponin molecules were located along the thin filaments. The density of immunogold particles was similar in the three muscles, and thus the amount of troponin in each muscle type was proportional to the number and length of actin filaments in each. Troponin was found in neither the mouse smooth muscle nor the outer muscular layer of the earthworm pseudoheart. The latter muscle showed an ultrastructural pattern that was intermediate between obliquely striated and smooth muscle. The estimated molecular weight for TnT in the earthworm was 55 kDa; this is higher than the weight of this protein in the mouse skeletal muscle (40 kDa) but similar to that of the D. melanogaster muscle (52 kDa).
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Troponin is present in both types of striated muscle (transversely striated and obliquely striated) of the earthworm with a distribution that is very similar to that observed in the mammalian striated muscle. As in vertebrates, troponin is absent in the smooth muscle of the earthworm. Discrepancies in the classification of some invertebrate muscles are common in the literature, and the use of distinctive markers, such as troponin, may improve our understanding of the nature and properties of many invertebrate muscles showing an ultrastructural pattern that does not resemble any of the classic muscle types.",1996,"M Royuela, R García-Anchuelo, M Paz de Miguel, M I Arenas, B Fraile, R Paniagua, M Royuela, R García-Anchuelo, M Paz de Miguel, M I Arenas, B Fraile, R Paniagua"

Hearing regulates Drosophila aggression,28115690,10.1073/pnas.1605946114,"Aggression is a universal social behavior important for the acquisition of food, mates, territory, and social status. Aggression in Drosophila is context-dependent and can thus be expected to involve inputs from multiple sensory modalities. Here, we use mechanical disruption and genetic approaches in Drosophila melanogaster to identify hearing as an important sensory modality in the context of intermale aggressive behavior. We demonstrate that neuronal silencing and targeted knockdown of hearing genes in the fly's auditory organ elicit abnormal aggression. Further, we show that exposure to courtship or aggression song has opposite effects on aggression. Our data define the importance of hearing in the control of Drosophila intermale aggression and open perspectives to decipher how hearing and other sensory modalities are integrated at the neural circuit level.",2017,"Marijke Versteven, Lies Vanden Broeck, Bart Geurten, Liesbeth Zwarts, Lisse Decraecker, Melissa Beelen, Martin C Göpfert, Ralf Heinrich, Patrick Callaerts, Marijke Versteven, Lies Vanden Broeck, Bart Geurten, Liesbeth Zwarts, Lisse Decraecker, Melissa Beelen, Martin C Göpfert, Ralf Heinrich, Patrick Callaerts"
