"[Analysis of DNA interband regions 3A5/A6, 3C5-6/c7 and 60E8-9/E10 of Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes]",11771302,,"Using electron microscopic (EM) data on the formation of a novel band from the P-element material after its insertion in the interband and the procedure of P-target rescue, DNA interband regions 3A5/A6, and 60E8-9/E10 of Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes were cloned and sequenced. EM analysis of the 3C region have shown that the formation of the full-size 3C5-6/C7 interband requires a 880-bp DNA sequences removed by deletion Df(1)faswb. A comparison of DNA sequences of six bands, two of which were obtained in the present work and four were described earlier, demonstrated the uniqueness of each of them in the Drosophila genome and heterogeneity of their molecular organization. Interband 60E8-9/E10 contains gene rpl19 transcribed throughout the development, in particular in salivary glands. In the other interbands examined 5' and 3' nontranslated gene regions are located. These results suggest that Drosophila interbands may contain both housekeeping genes and regulatory sequences of currently inactive genes from adjacent bands.",2001,"S A Demakov, A A Gorchakov, Iu B Shvarts, V F Semeshin, I F Zhimulev, S A Demakov, A A Gorchakov, Iu B Shvarts, V F Semeshin, I F Zhimulev"
Role of trehalose phosphate synthase in anoxia tolerance and development in Drosophila melanogaster,11719513,10.1074/jbc.M109479200,"Recent studies have shown that trehalose plays a protective role in yeast in a variety of stresses, including heat, freezing and thawing, dehydration, hyperosmotic shock, and oxidant injury. Because (a) heat shock and anoxia share mechanisms that allow organisms to survive, (b) Drosophila melanogaster is tolerant to anoxia, and (c) trehalose is present in flies and is metabolically active, we asked whether trehalose can protect against anoxic stress. Here we report on a new role of trehalose in anoxia resistance in Drosophila. We first cloned the gene trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (tps1), which synthesizes trehalose, and examined the effect of tps1 overexpression as well as mutation on the resistance of Drosophila to anoxia. Upon induction of tps1, trehalose increased, and this was associated with increased tolerance to anoxia. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that trehalose reduced protein aggregation caused by anoxia. Homozygous tps1 mutant (P-element insertion into the third intron of the gene) leads to lethality at an early larval stage, and excision of the P-element rescues totally the phenotype. We conclude that trehalose contributes to anoxia tolerance in flies; this protection is likely to be due to a reduction of protein aggregation.",2002,"Qiaofang Chen, Enbo Ma, Kevin L Behar, Tian Xu, Gabriel G Haddad, Qiaofang Chen, Enbo Ma, Kevin L Behar, Tian Xu, Gabriel G Haddad"

Immunocytochemical studies on fly sections indicated that the product of the Dm1 mAChR gene was localized in the antennal lobes and in other regions of the brain and thoracic nervous system. Intense staining in the glomeruli of the antennal lobes, the region of the nervous system containing terminals of antennal olfactory sensory neurones and mechanosensory neurones, indicates possible roles for this mAChR gene product in the processing of olfactory and mechanosensory signals in the fly. The staining of a discrete group of neurosecretory cells in the pars intercerebralis of the brain indicates a possible new role for this mAChR in the regulation of neurosecretion.

"The alpha-amylase gene in Drosophila melanogaster: nucleotide sequence, gene structure and expression motifs",3024105,10.1093/nar/14.21.8399,"We present the complete nucleotide sequence of a Drosophila alpha-amylase gene and its flanking regions, as determined by cDNA and genomic sequence analysis. This gene, unlike its mammalian counterparts, contains no introns. Nevertheless the insect and mammalian genes share extensive nucleotide similarity and the insect protein contains the four amino acid sequence blocks common to all alpha-amylases. In Drosophila melanogaster, there are two closely-linked copies of the alpha-amylase gene and they are divergently transcribed. In the 5'-regions of the two gene-copies we find high sequence divergence, yet the typical eukaryotic gene expression motifs have been maintained. The 5'-terminus of the alpha-amylase mRNA, as determined by primer extension analysis, maps to a characteristic Drosophila sequence motif. Additional conserved elements upstream of both genes may also be involved in amylase gene expression which is known to be under complex controls that include glucose repression.",1986,"P H Boer, D A Hickey, P H Boer, D A Hickey"

Receptor Tyrosine Kinases in Development: Insights from Drosophila,31888080,10.3390/ijms21010188,"Cell-to-cell communication mediates a plethora of cellular decisions and behaviors that are crucial for the correct and robust development of multicellular organisms. Many of these signals are encoded in secreted hormones or growth factors that bind to and activate cell surface receptors, to transmit the cue intracellularly. One of the major superfamilies of cell surface receptors are the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). For nearly half a century RTKs have been the focus of intensive study due to their ability to alter fundamental aspects of cell biology, such as cell proliferation, growth, and shape, and because of their central importance in diseases such as cancer. Studies in model organisms such a Drosophila melanogaster have proved invaluable for identifying new conserved RTK pathway components, delineating their contributions, and for the discovery of conserved mechanisms that control RTK-signaling events. Here we provide a brief overview of the RTK superfamily and the general mechanisms used in their regulation. We further highlight the functions of several RTKs that govern distinct cell-fate decisions in Drosophila and explore how their activities are developmentally controlled.",2019,"Sarah Mele, Travis K Johnson, Sarah Mele, Travis K Johnson"
BK Ca ( Slo) Channel Regulates Mitochondrial Function and Lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster,31438578,10.3390/cells8090945,"BKCa channels, originally discovered in Drosophila melanogaster as slowpoke (slo), are recognized for their roles in cellular and organ physiology.

Here, we demonstrate that BKCa channels are present in fly mitochondria, and slo mutants show structural and functional defects in mitochondria. slo mutants display an increase in reactive oxygen species and the modulation of ROS affected their survival. We also found that the absence of BKCa channels reduced the lifespan of Drosophila, and overexpression of human BKCa channels in flies extends life span in males.

Transcriptome analysis reveals mechanisms of geroprotective effects of fucoxanthin in Drosophila,29504896,10.1186/s12864-018-4471-x,"Background:
      
    

    
      We have previously showed that the carotenoid fucoxanthin can increase the lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. However, the molecular mechanisms of the geroprotective effect of fucoxanthin have not been studied so far.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here, we studied the effects of fucoxanthin on the Drosophila aging process at the molecular and the whole organism levels. At the organismal level, fucoxanthin increased the median lifespan and had a positive effect on fecundity, fertility, intestinal barrier function, and nighttime sleep. Transcriptome analysis revealed 57 differentially expressed genes involved in 17 KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways. Among the most represented molecular pathways induced by fucoxanthin, a significant portion is related to longevity, including MAPK, mTOR, Wnt, Notch, and Hippo signaling pathways, autophagy, translation, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, apoptosis, immune response, neurogenesis, sleep, and response to DNA damage.

We observed also that w1118 mutants have progressive loss of climbing ability, shortened life span, as well as impaired resistance to various forms of stress. Retinal degeneration was abolished by transgenic expression of mini-white+ in the white null background w1118 . We conclude that beyond the classical eye-color phenotype, mutations in Drosophila white gene could impair several biological functions affecting parameters like mobility, life span and stress tolerance. Consequently, we suggest caution and attentiveness during the interpretation of old experiments employing white mutant flies and when planning new ones, especially within the research field of neurodegeneration and neuroprotection.

A thorough understanding is crucial for identifying potential new drug targets and designing drugs against which the pathogens might not develop resistance easily. Model organisms are a useful tool for this endeavor, thanks to the power of their genetics. Drosophila melanogaster is widely used to study host-pathogen interactions. Its basal immune response is well understood and is briefly reviewed here. Considerations relevant to choosing an adequate infection model are discussed. This review then focuses mainly on infections with two categories of pathogens, the well-studied Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa and infections by fungi of medical interest. These examples provide an overview over the current knowledge on Drosophila-pathogen interactions and illustrate the approaches that can be used to study those interactions.

They commonly manipulate host reproduction in a variety of ways and thereby favour their invasion into host populations. While the biology of Wolbachia has been extensively studied at the ecological and phenotypic level, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between Wolbachia and their hosts. Recent comparative genomics studies of Wolbachia strains have revealed putative candidate genes involved in the expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in insects. However the functional testing of these genes is hindered by the lack of available genetic tools in Wolbachia. To circumvent this problem we generated transgenic Drosophila lines expressing various Wolbachia CI candidate genes under the control of the GAL4/UAS system in order to evaluate their possible role in Wolbachia-related phenotypes in Drosophila. The expression of a number of these genes in Drosophila melanogaster failed to mimic or alter CI phenotypes across a range of Wolbachia backgrounds or in the absence of Wolbachia.",2011,"R Yamada, I Iturbe-Ormaetxe, J C Brownlie, S L O'Neill, R Yamada, I Iturbe-Ormaetxe, J C Brownlie, S L O'Neill"

Using 2 different cardiovascular stress methods (elevated ambient temperature and external electrical pacing), we found that maximal heart rate is significantly and reproducibly reduced with aging in Drosophila, analogous to observations in elderly humans. We also describe for the first time several other aspects of the cardiac physiology of young adult and aging Drosophila, including an age-associated increase in rhythm disturbances. These observations suggest that the study of declining cardiac function in aging flies may serve as a genetically tractable model for genome-wide mutational screening for genes that participate in or protect against cardiac aging and disease.",2001,"G Paternostro, C Vignola, D U Bartsch, J H Omens, A D McCulloch, J C Reed, G Paternostro, C Vignola, D U Bartsch, J H Omens, A D McCulloch, J C Reed"

Sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster and Musca domestica converges at the level of the terminal regulator doublesex,14673649,10.1007/s00427-003-0372-2,"Sex-determining cascades are supposed to have evolved in a retrograde manner from bottom to top. Wilkins' 1995 hypothesis finds support from our comparative studies in Drosophila melanogaster and Musca domestica, two dipteran species that separated some 120 million years ago. The sex-determining cascades in these flies differ at the level of the primary sex-determining signal and their targets, Sxl in Drosophila and F in Musca. Here we present evidence that they converge at the level of the terminal regulator, doublesex ( dsx), which conveys the selected sexual fate to the differentiation genes. The dsx homologue in Musca, Md-dsx, encodes male-specific (MdDSX(M)) and female-specific (MdDSX(F)) protein variants which correspond in structure to those in Drosophila. Sex-specific regulation of Md-dsx is controlled by the switch gene F via a splicing mechanism that is similar but in some relevant aspects different from that in Drosophila. MdDSX(F) expression can activate the vitellogenin genes in Drosophila and Musca males, and MdDSX(M) expression in Drosophila females can cause male-like pigmentation of posterior tergites, suggesting that these Musca dsx variants are conserved not only in structure but also in function. Furthermore, downregulation of Md-dsx activity in Musca by injecting dsRNA into embryos leads to intersexual differentiation of the gonads. These results strongly support a role of Md-dsx as the final regulatory gene in the sex-determining hierarchy of the housefly.",2004,"Monika Hediger, Géza Burghardt, Christina Siegenthaler, Nathalie Buser, Denise Hilfiker-Kleiner, Andreas Dübendorfer, Daniel Bopp, Monika Hediger, Géza Burghardt, Christina Siegenthaler, Nathalie Buser, Denise Hilfiker-Kleiner, Andreas Dübendorfer, Daniel Bopp"

Quantification of D- and L-2-Hydroxyglutarate in Drosophila melanogaster Tissue Samples Using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry,31119662,10.1007/978-1-4939-9236-2_10,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as an ideal system in which to study 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) metabolism. Unlike many mammalian tissues and cell lines, which primarily accumulate D- or L-2HG as the result of genetic mutations or metabolic stress, Drosophila larvae accumulate high concentrations of L-2HG during normal larval growth. As a result, flies represent one of the few model systems that allows for studies of endogenous L-2HG metabolism. Moreover, the Drosophila genome not only encodes key enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of D-2HG, but the fly has also been used as to investigate the in vivo effects of oncogenic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) mutations. All of these studies, however, rely on mass spectrometry-based methods to distinguish between the D- and L-2HG enantiomers.

Third-instar larvae of Drosophila carrying these apoptotic genes were exposed to fungal VOCs emitted from growing mold cultures for 10 days. The larval strains carrying apoptopic genes survived longer than the control wild type larvae; moreover, of those that survived, heterozygous reaper and dronc strains progressed to pupae and adult phases more rapidly, suggesting that fungal VOCs may induce apoptotic changes in flies.

In contrast to other Drosophila non-LTR elements, a major initiation site for sense transcripts was mapped near the 3' end of the TART 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR), rather than at the start of the 5'-UTR. A sequence overlapping this sense start site contains a good match to an initiator consensus for the transcription start sites of Drosophila LTR retrotransposons. Interestingly, analysis of 5' RACE products for antisense transcripts and the GenBank EST database revealed that TART antisense transcripts contain multiple introns.

Contribution of Intellectual Disability-Related Genes to ADHD Risk and to Locomotor Activity in Drosophila,32046534,10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.18050599,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common, highly heritable neuropsychiatric disorder. ADHD often co-occurs with intellectual disability, and shared overlapping genetics have been suggested. The aim of this study was to identify novel ADHD genes by investigating whether genes carrying rare mutations linked to intellectual disability contribute to ADHD risk through common genetic variants. Validation and characterization of candidates were performed using Drosophila melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Common genetic variants in a diagnostic gene panel of 396 autosomal intellectual disability genes were tested for association with ADHD risk through gene set and gene-wide analyses, using ADHD meta-analytic data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium for discovery (N=19,210) and ADHD data from the Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative Psychiatric Research for replication (N=37,076). The significant genes were functionally validated and characterized in Drosophila by assessing locomotor activity and sleep upon knockdown of those genes in brain circuits.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The intellectual disability gene set was significantly associated with ADHD risk in the discovery and replication data sets. The three genes most consistently associated were MEF2C, ST3GAL3, and TRAPPC9. Performing functional characterization of the two evolutionarily conserved genes in Drosophila melanogaster, the authors found that their knockdown in dopaminergic (dMEF2) and circadian neurons (dTRAPPC9) resulted in increased locomotor activity and reduced sleep, concordant with the human phenotype.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study reveals that a large set of intellectual disability-related genes contribute to ADHD risk through effects of common alleles. Utilizing this continuity, the authors identified TRAPPC9, MEF2C, and ST3GAL3 as novel ADHD candidate genes. Characterization in Drosophila suggests that TRAPPC9 and MEF2C contribute to ADHD-related behavior through distinct neural substrates.",2020,"Marieke Klein, Euginia L Singgih, Anne van Rens, Ditte Demontis, Anders D Børglum, Nina Roth Mota, Anna Castells-Nobau, Lambertus A Kiemeney, Han G Brunner, Alejandro Arias-Vasquez, Annette Schenck, Monique van der Voet, Barbara Franke, Marieke Klein, Euginia L Singgih, Anne van Rens, Ditte Demontis, Anders D Børglum, Nina Roth Mota, Anna Castells-Nobau, Lambertus A Kiemeney, Han G Brunner, Alejandro Arias-Vasquez, Annette Schenck, Monique van der Voet, Barbara Franke"

We describe here the genetic organisation of the Alh locus in D. melanogaster. We show that an independent lethal complementation group encoding a muscle protein (Mlp84B) is located within an Alh intron. We have already shown that the leucine zipper (LZ) domain of ALH activates several Polycomb group-responsive elements.

In situ hybridizations on salivary gland polytene chromosomes with these probes show that the whole right arm, including genes within cytological region 101EF-102F, is inverted relative to D. simulans. We also used these probes to determine the orientation of the arm of the dot chromosome in nine species of Drosophila, including eight from the melanogaster subfamily.

Neural stem cells (neuroblasts) generate the nervous system in insects and in higher crustaceans (malacostracans); in the remaining euarthropod groups, the chelicerates (e.g. spiders) and myriapods (e.g. millipedes), neuroblasts are missing. In the latter taxa, groups of neural precursors segregate from the neuroectoderm and directly differentiate into neurons and glial cells. In all euarthropod groups, achaete-scute homologues are required for neuroblast/neural precursor group formation. In the insects Drosophila melanogaster and Tribolium castaneum achaete-scute homologues are initially expressed in clusters of cells (proneural clusters) in the neuroepithelium but expression becomes restricted to the future neuroblast. Subsequently genes such as snail and prospero are expressed in the neuroblasts which are required for asymmetric division and differentiation. In contrast to insects, malacostracan neuroblasts do not segregate into the embryo but remain in the outer neuroepithelium, similar to vertebrate neural stem cells. It has been suggested that neuroblasts are present in another crustacean group, the branchiopods, and that they also remain in the neuroepithelium. This raises the questions how the molecular mechanisms of neuroblast selection have been modified during crustacean and insect evolution and if the segregation or the maintenance of neuroblasts in the neuroepithelium represents the ancestral state. Here we take advantage of the recently published Daphnia pulex (branchiopod) genome and identify genes in Daphnia magna that are known to be required for the selection and asymmetric division of neuroblasts in the fruit fly D. melanogaster. We unambiguously identify neuroblasts in D. magna by molecular marker gene expression and division pattern. We show for the first time that branchiopod neuroblasts divide in the same pattern as insect and malacostracan neuroblasts. Furthermore, in contrast to D. melanogaster, neuroblasts are not selected from proneural clusters in the branchiopod. Snail rather than ASH is the first gene to be expressed in the nascent neuroblasts suggesting that ASH is not required for the selection of neuroblasts as in D. melanogaster. The prolonged expression of ASH in D. magna furthermore suggests that it is involved in the maintenance of the neuroblasts in the neuroepithelium. Based on these and additional data from various representatives of arthropods we conclude that the selection of neural precursors from proneural clusters as well as the segregation of neural precursors represents the ancestral state of neurogenesis in arthropods. We discuss that the derived characters of malacostracans and branchiopods - the absence of neuroblast segregation and proneural clusters - might be used to support or reject the possible groupings of paraphyletic crustaceans.",2011,"Petra Ungerer, Bo Joakim Eriksson, Angelika Stollewerk, Petra Ungerer, Bo Joakim Eriksson, Angelika Stollewerk"

Sirt4 Modulates Oxidative Metabolism and Sensitivity to Rapamycin Through Species-Dependent Phenotypes in Drosophila mtDNA Haplotypes,32152006,10.1534/g3.120.401174,"The endosymbiotic theory proposes that eukaryotes evolved from the symbiotic relationship between anaerobic (host) and aerobic prokaryotes. Through iterative genetic transfers, the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes coevolved, establishing the mitochondria as the hub of oxidative metabolism. To study this coevolution, we disrupt mitochondrial-nuclear epistatic interactions by using strains that have mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) from evolutionarily divergent species. We undertake a multifaceted approach generating introgressed Drosophila strains containing D. simulans mtDNA and D. melanogaster nDNA with Sirtuin 4 (Sirt4 )-knockouts. Sirt4 is a nuclear-encoded enzyme that functions, exclusively within the mitochondria, as a master regulator of oxidative metabolism. We exposed flies to the drug rapamycin in order to eliminate TOR signaling, thereby compromising the cytoplasmic crosstalk between the mitochondria and nucleus. Our results indicate that D. simulans and D. melanogaster mtDNA haplotypes display opposite Sirt4-mediated phenotypes in the regulation of whole-fly oxygen consumption. Moreover, our data reflect that the deletion of Sirt4 rescued the metabolic response to rapamycin among the introgressed strains.

Readapting to DCV Infection without Wolbachia: Frequency Changes of Drosophila Antiviral Alleles Can Replace Endosymbiont Protection,29947761,10.1093/gbe/evy137,"There is now ample evidence that endosymbionts can contribute to host adaptation to environmental challenges. However, how endosymbiont presence affects the adaptive trajectory and outcome of the host is yet largely unexplored. In Drosophila, Wolbachia confers protection to RNA virus infection, an effect that differs between Wolbachia strains and can be targeted by selection. Adaptation to RNA virus infections is mediated by both Wolbachia and the host, raising the question of whether adaptive genetic changes in the host vary with the presence/absence of the endosymbiont. Here, we address this question using a polymorphic D. melanogaster population previously adapted to DCV infection for 35 generations in the presence of Wolbachia, from which we removed the endosymbiont and followed survival over the subsequent 20 generations of infection. After an initial severe drop, survival frequencies upon DCV selection increased significantly, as seen before in the presence of Wolbachia. Whole-genome sequencing, revealed that the major genes involved in the first selection experiment, pastrel and Ubc-E2H, continued to be selected in Wolbachia-free D. melanogaster, with the frequencies of protective alleles being closer to fixation in the absence of Wolbachia. Our results suggest that heterogeneity in Wolbachia infection status may be sufficient to maintain polymorphisms even in the absence of costs.",2018,"Vitor G Faria, Nelson E Martins, Christian Schlötterer, Élio Sucena, Vitor G Faria, Nelson E Martins, Christian Schlötterer, Élio Sucena"
Wolbachia infection and cytoplasmic incompatibility in Drosophila species,8913750,,"Forty-one stocks from 30 Drosophila species were surveyed for Wolbachia infection using PCR technology. D. sechellia and two strains of D. auraria were found to be infected and were tested for the expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility, along with D. ananassae and D. melanogaster strains, which are already known to be infected. D. ananassae and D. melanogaster show levels of incompatibility up to 25%, while D. auraria and D. sechellia exhibit levels of egg mortality approximately 60%. A dot-blot assay using the dnaA sequence as probe was developed to assess the infection levels in individual males that were used in incompatibility crosses. A positive correlation between bacterial density and cytoplasmic incompatibility was observed. The stocks examined can be clustered into at least two groups, depending on the levels of infection relative to the degree of cytoplasmic incompatibility exhibited. One group, containing D. simulans Hawaii, D. sechellia, and D. auraria, exhibits high levels of cytoplasmic incompatibility relative to levels of infection; all the other species and D. simulans Riverside exhibit significantly lower levels of cytoplasmic incompatibility relative to levels of infection. These data show that, in addition to bacterial density, bacterial and/ or host factors also affect the expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility.",1996,"K Bourtzis, A Nirgianaki, G Markakis, C Savakis, K Bourtzis, A Nirgianaki, G Markakis, C Savakis"
Developmentally regulated RNA transcripts coding for alcohol dehydrogenase in Drosophila affinidisjuncta,2429897,,"The organization of the gene coding for alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) in Drosophila affinidisjuncta has been determined by physically mapping Adh RNA transcripts to cloned genomic DNA. Two distinct transcript types accumulate with developmental specificity. Because only a single genomic Adh locus is detected in D. affinidisjuncta, and since all Adh transcripts appear to be identical except at their termini, the two Adh RNA types are products of the same gene. One type of transcript, abundant in adults, contains a small 5' terminal exon that is completely lacking in the other type of transcript, which accumulates in larvae. This 5' end difference suggests that the D. affinidisjuncta Adh gene, like the homologous gene from the distantly related species D. melanogaster, is expressed from two promoters. According to the transcription map, these D. affinidisjuncta promoters are separated by approximately 560 base pairs of genomic DNA sequence. D. affinidisjuncta Adh transcripts also resemble D. melanogaster Adh transcripts in both their overall organization and their developmental distribution. Multiple 3' ends are responsible for the size heterogeneity of both types of D. affinidisjuncta Adh RNA, and some of these also appear with stage specificity.",1986,"R G Rowan, M D Brennan, W J Dickinson, R G Rowan, M D Brennan, W J Dickinson"
cis-regulatory architecture of a short-range EGFR organizing center in the Drosophila melanogaster leg,30142157,10.1371/journal.pgen.1007568,"We characterized the establishment of an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) organizing center (EOC) during leg development in Drosophila melanogaster. Initial EGFR activation occurs in the center of leg discs by expression of the EGFR ligand Vn and the EGFR ligand-processing protease Rho, each through single enhancers, vnE and rhoE, that integrate inputs from Wg, Dpp, Dll and Sp1. Deletion of vnE and rhoE eliminates vn and rho expression in the center of the leg imaginal discs, respectively. Animals with deletions of both vnE and rhoE (but not individually) show distal but not medial leg truncations, suggesting that the distal source of EGFR ligands acts at short-range to only specify distal-most fates, and that multiple additional 'ring' enhancers are responsible for medial fates. Further, based on the cis-regulatory logic of vnE and rhoE we identified many additional leg enhancers, suggesting that this logic is broadly used by many genes during Drosophila limb development.",2018,"Susan Newcomb, Roumen Voutev, Aurelie Jory, Rebecca K Delker, Matthew Slattery, Richard S Mann, Susan Newcomb, Roumen Voutev, Aurelie Jory, Rebecca K Delker, Matthew Slattery, Richard S Mann"

Bällchen participates in proliferation control and prevents the differentiation of Drosophila melanogaster neuronal stem cells,25190057,10.1242/bio.20148631,"Stem cells continuously generate differentiating daughter cells and are essential for tissue homeostasis and development. Their capacity to self-renew as undifferentiated and actively dividing cells is controlled by either external signals from a cellular environment, the stem cell niche, or asymmetric distribution of cell fate determinants during cell division. Here we report that the protein kinase Bällchen (BALL) is required to prevent differentiation as well as to maintain normal proliferation of neuronal stem cells of Drosophila melanogaster, called neuroblasts. Our results show that the brains of ball mutant larvae are severely reduced in size, which is caused by a reduced proliferation rate of the neuroblasts. Moreover, ball mutant neuroblasts gradually lose the expression of the neuroblast determinants Miranda and aPKC, suggesting their premature differentiation. Our results indicate that BALL represents a novel cell intrinsic factor with a dual function regulating the proliferative capacity and the differentiation status of neuronal stem cells during development.",2014,"Toma Yakulov, Ufuk Günesdogan, Herbert Jäckle, Alf Herzig, Toma Yakulov, Ufuk Günesdogan, Herbert Jäckle, Alf Herzig"

Highly significant differences occurred in the larval speed of movement after exposure to EMF, with maximal effect occurred for larvae exposed to mobile phone (their speed of movement increased 2.5 times of wild type).

This region includes 57 predicted protein-coding genes. Seventeen of these genes are in six clusters that appear to have arisen by tandem duplication. Within this region we found 23 complementation groups that are essential for zygotic viability, and we have identified the transcription units for 18 of the 23. We also found a 55 kb region in 72D that is nonessential. Flies deficient for this region are viable and fertile. Within this nonessential region are 48 DNA sequences of 12 to 33 base pairs that are completely conserved among 12 distantly related Drosophila species. These sequences do not have the evolutionary signature of conserved protein-coding DNA sequences, nor do they appear to encode microRNAs, however, the strong selection suggests functions in wild populations that are not apparent in laboratory cultures.

Lipin is a central regulator of adipose tissue development and function in Drosophila melanogaster,21300783,10.1128/MCB.01335-10,"Lipins are evolutionarily conserved proteins found from yeasts to humans. Mammalian and yeast lipin proteins have been shown to control gene expression and to enzymatically convert phosphatidate to diacylglycerol, an essential precursor in triacylglcerol (TAG) and phospholipid synthesis. Loss of lipin 1 in the mouse, but not in humans, leads to lipodystrophy and fatty liver disease. Here we show that the single lipin orthologue of Drosophila melanogaster (dLipin) is essential for normal adipose tissue (fat body) development and TAG storage. dLipin mutants are characterized by reductions in larval fat body mass, whole-animal TAG content, and lipid droplet size. Individual cells of the underdeveloped fat body are characterized by increased size and ultrastructural defects affecting cell nuclei, mitochondria, and autophagosomes. Under starvation conditions, dLipin is transcriptionally upregulated and functions to promote survival. Together, these data show that dLipin is a central player in lipid and energy metabolism, and they establish Drosophila as a genetic model for further studies of conserved functions of the lipin family of metabolic regulators.",2011,"Rupali Ugrankar, Yanling Liu, Jill Provaznik, Sandra Schmitt, Michael Lehmann, Rupali Ugrankar, Yanling Liu, Jill Provaznik, Sandra Schmitt, Michael Lehmann"
Recombination yet inefficient selection along the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup's fourth chromosome,20008457,10.1093/molbev/msp291,"A central goal of evolutionary genetics is an understanding of the forces responsible for the observed variation, both within and between species. Theoretical and empirical work have demonstrated that genetic recombination contributes to this variation by breaking down linkage between nucleotide sites, thus allowing them to behave independently and for selective forces to act efficiently on them. The Drosophila fourth chromosome, which is believed to experience no-or very low-rates of recombination has been an important model for investigating these effects. Despite previous efforts, central questions regarding the extent of recombination and the predominant modes of selection acting on it remain open. In order to more comprehensively test hypotheses regarding recombination and its potential influence on selection along the fourth chromosome, we have resequenced regions from most of its genes from Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. yakuba. These data, along with available outgroup sequence, demonstrate that recombination is low but significantly greater than zero for the three species. Despite there being recombination, there is strong evidence that its frequency is low enough to have rendered selection relatively inefficient.

The transcriptional Trl level of adult Trl362 females was markedly lowered. Little or no GAGA protein, encoded by Trl@, was detected in the nurse cell nuclei. The ovaries of Trl362 females showed impairments, such considerable changes in the structure of both ovarioles and individual egg chambers. We believe that the observed ovarian defects in Trl362 mutants are mostly due to a decreased amount of GAGA protein in the germline cells. An increase of GAGA-519 protein caused by introduction of hsp83:GAGA-519 transgene against Trl362 background rescued partially the female fertility. It may well be that a decrease of GAGA protein in Trl362 germline cells leads to a defective expression of the genes regulated by transcription factor GAGA, whose products are essential for normal Drosophila oogenesis.",2006,"A A Ogienko, D A Karagodin, S A Fedorova, E V Fedorova, V V Lashina, E M Baricheva, A A Ogienko, D A Karagodin, S A Fedorova, E V Fedorova, V V Lashina, E M Baricheva"

Adult emergence of wild-type but not of cadmium-resistant flies was reduced in the presence of cadmium. Verapamil in the larval diet without cadmium had no effect on adult emergence in either strain. Verapamil in the diet spiked with cadmium significantly reduced adult emergence in both strains. This result is indicative of an interaction between the efflux of cadmium and verapamil and demonstrates that pgps have a role in regulating the toxicity of cadmium in Drosophil.

Using standard extraction methods and thin layer chromatography, phospholipid composition was assayed in wholeflies and in heads.

Variation in morphological traits of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) under nutritional stress,10098267,10.1038/sj.hdy.6884660,"The effect of nutritional stress on phenotypical and genetic variation was examined for five morphological traits (thorax length, wing length, sternopleural chaeta number, abdominal chaeta number and arista branch number) in 30 isofemale lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Phenotypical variation of all traits except sternopleural chaeta number and fluctuating asymmetry of all bilateral traits were significantly higher in flies reared under poor feeding conditions. Estimates of isofemale line heritability (coefficients of intraclass correlation) did not show a consistent pattern among traits. However, additive genetic variance was generally higher in poor feeding conditions in all traits except sternopleural chaeta number, although these differences were not statistically significant. Similarly, estimates of evolvability were higher under nutritional stress for all traits except sternopleural chaeta number.

These data represent the first SWATH spectral library available for Drosophila and will be a useful resource for the community. A total of 52 interacting proteins were identified, including several molecules involved in translation such as structural components of the ribosome, factors regulating translation initiation or elongation, and RNA binding proteins. Among these 52 proteins, 15 were identified as partners by the SWATH strategy only. Interestingly, these 15 proteins are significantly enriched for the functions translation and nucleic acid binding. This enrichment reflects the engagement of RACK1 at the ribosome and highlights the added value of SWATH analysis. A functional screen did not reveal any protein sharing the interesting properties of RACK1, which is required for IRES-dependent translation and not essential for cell viability.

An RNAi Screen for Genes Involved in Nanoscale Protrusion Formation on Corneal Lens in Drosophila melanogaster,27927092,10.2108/zs160105,"The ""moth-eye"" structure, which is observed on the surface of corneal lens in several insects, supports anti-reflective and self-cleaning functions due to nanoscale protrusions known as corneal nipples.

In the present study, we sought to identify genes involved in ""moth-eye"" structure, formation in order to elucidate the developmental mechanism of the protrusions in Drosophila. We re-examined the aberrant patterns in classical glossy-eye mutants by scanning electron microscope and classified the aberrant patterns into groups. Next, we screened genes encoding putative structural cuticular proteins and genes involved in cuticular formation using eye specific RNAi silencing methods combined with the Gal4/UAS expression system.

"FB-NOF is a non-autonomous transposable element, expressed in Drosophila melanogaster and present only in the melanogaster group",23685284,10.1016/j.gene.2013.04.082,"Most foldback elements are defective due to the lack of coding sequences but some are associated with coding sequences and may represent the entire element. This is the case of the NOF sequences found in the FB of Drosophila melanogaster, formerly considered as an autonomous TE and currently proposed as part of the so-called FB-NOF element, the transposon that would be complete and fully functional. NOF is always associated with FB and never seen apart from the FB inverted repeats (IR). This is the reason why the FB-NOF composite element can be considered the complete element. At least one of its ORFs encodes a protein that has always been considered its transposase, but no detailed studies have been carried out to verify this. In this work we test the hypothesis that FB-NOF is an active transposon nowadays. We search for its expression product, obtaining its cDNA, and propose the ORF and the sequence of its potential protein. We found that the NOF protein is not a transposase as it lacks any of the motifs of known transposases and also shows structural homology with hydrolases, therefore FB-NOF cannot belong to the superfamily MuDR/foldback, as up to now it has been classified, and can be considered as a non-autonomous transposable element. The alignment with the published genomes of 12 Drosophila species shows that NOF presence is restricted only to the 6 Drosophila species belonging to the melanogaster group.",2013,"Martí Badal, Noel Xamena, Oriol Cabré, Martí Badal, Noel Xamena, Oriol Cabré"
Common pattern of evolution of gene expression level and protein sequence in Drosophila,15034135,10.1093/molbev/msh128,"Sequence divergence scaled by variation within species has been used to infer the action of selection upon individual genes. Applying this approach to expression, we compared whole-genome whole-body RNA levels in 10 heterozygous Drosophila simulans genotypes and a pooled sample of 10 D. melanogaster lines using Affymetrix Genechip. For 972 genes expressed in D. melanogaster, the transcript level was below detection threshold in D. simulans, which may be explained either by sequence divergence between the primers on the chip and the mRNA transcripts or by down-regulation of these genes. Out of 6,707 genes that were expressed in both species, transcript level was significantly different between species for 534 genes (at P < 0.001). Genes whose expression is under stabilizing selection should exhibit reduced genetic variation within species and reduced divergence between species. Expression of genes under directional selection in D. simulans should be highly divergent from D. melanogaster, while showing low genetic variation in D. simulans. Finally, the genes with large variation within species but modest divergence between species are candidates for balancing selection. Rapidly diverging, low-polymorphism genes included those involved in reproduction (e.g., Mst 3Ba, 98Cb; Acps 26Aa, 63F; and sperm-specific dynein). Genes with high variation in transcript abundance within species included metallothionein and hairless, both hypothesized to be segregating in nature because of gene-by-environment interactions. Further, we compared expression divergence and DNA substitution rate in 195 genes. Synonymous substitution rate and expression divergences were uncorrelated, whereas there was a significant positive correlation between nonsynonymous substitution rate and expression divergence. We hypothesize that as a substantial fraction of nonsynonymous divergence has been shown to be adaptive, much of the observed expression divergence is likewise adaptive.",2004,"Sergey V Nuzhdin, Marta L Wayne, Kristy L Harmon, Lauren M McIntyre, Sergey V Nuzhdin, Marta L Wayne, Kristy L Harmon, Lauren M McIntyre"

The characteristics that distinguish good model clades from good model organisms (e.g., Drosophila melanogaster) are somewhat different so we first define what constitutes a good evolutionary model.

piRNA Biogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,28964526,10.1016/j.tig.2017.09.002,"The PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway is a conserved defense system that protects the genome integrity of the animal germline from deleterious transposable elements. Targets of silencing are recognized by small noncoding piRNAs that are processed from long precursor molecules. Although piRNAs and other classes of small noncoding RNAs, such as miRNAs and small interfering (si)RNAs, interact with members of the same family of Argonaute (Ago) proteins and their function in target repression is similar, the biogenesis of piRNAs differs from those of the other two small RNAs. Recently, many aspects of piRNA biogenesis have been revealed in Drosophila melanogaster. In this review, we elaborate on piRNA biogenesis in Drosophila somatic and germline cells. We focus on the mechanisms by which piRNA precursor transcription is regulated and highlight recent work that has advanced our understanding of piRNA precursor processing to mature piRNAs.

In this study, we used a subset of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, a population of inbred, genome-sequenced lines derived from a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster, to investigate whether this population harbors genetic variation for a set of stress resistance and life history traits. Using a genomic approach, we found substantial genetic variation for metabolic rate, heat stress resistance, expression of a major heat shock protein, and egg-to-adult viability investigated at a benign and a higher stressful temperature. This suggests that these traits will be able to evolve. In addition, we outline an approach to conduct pathway associations based on genomic linear models, which has potential to identify adaptive genes and pathways, and therefore can be a valuable tool in conservation genomics.",2016,"Palle Duun Rohde, Kristian Krag, Volker Loeschcke, Johannes Overgaard, Peter Sørensen, Torsten Nygaard Kristensen, Palle Duun Rohde, Kristian Krag, Volker Loeschcke, Johannes Overgaard, Peter Sørensen, Torsten Nygaard Kristensen"
Stable intronic sequence RNAs have possible regulatory roles in Drosophila melanogaster,26504165,10.1083/jcb.201507065,"Stable intronic sequence RNAs (sisRNAs) have been found in Xenopus tropicalis, human cell lines, and Epstein-Barr virus; however, the biological significance of sisRNAs remains poorly understood. We identify sisRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster by deep sequencing, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and Northern blotting. We characterize a sisRNA (sisR-1) from the regena (rga) locus and show that it can be processed from the precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). We also document a cis-natural antisense transcript (ASTR) from the rga locus, which is highly expressed in early embryos. During embryogenesis, ASTR promotes robust rga pre-mRNA expression. Interestingly, sisR-1 represses ASTR, with consequential effects on rga pre-mRNA expression. Our results suggest a model in which sisR-1 modulates its host gene expression by repressing ASTR during embryogenesis. We propose that sisR-1 belongs to a class of sisRNAs with probable regulatory activities in Drosophila.",2015,"Jun Wei Pek, Ismail Osman, Mandy Li-Ian Tay, Ruther Teo Zheng, Jun Wei Pek, Ismail Osman, Mandy Li-Ian Tay, Ruther Teo Zheng"

Geneswitch was activated by feeding the steroid RU486, to the flies. We used an aversive classical conditioning paradigm to quantify memory and measures of activity to infer sleep. Immune stimulated flies exhibited reduced levels of sleep, which could not be explained by a generalised increase in waking activity. Immune stimulated flies also showed a reduction in memory abilities. These results lend support to Drosophila as a model for immune-neural interactions and provide a possible role for sleep in the interplay between the immune response and memory.",2014,"Eamonn B Mallon, Akram Alghamdi, Robert T K Holdbrook, Ezio Rosato, Eamonn B Mallon, Akram Alghamdi, Robert T K Holdbrook, Ezio Rosato"

Climbing behavior was assessed manually, as in our previous studies, and with the automated apparatus within the same experiment yielding statistically similar results.

"Oh, the places they'll go: Female sperm storage and sperm precedence in Drosophila melanogaster",23087839,10.4161/spmg.21655,"Among most animals with internal fertilization, females store sperm in specific regions of their reproductive tract for later use. Sperm storage enables prolonged fertility, physical and temporal separation of mating from fertilization and, when females mate with multiple males, opportunities for differential use of the various males' sperm. Thus, stored sperm move within the female reproductive tract as well as to several potential fates - fertilization, displacement by other sperm or ejection by the female. Drosophila melanogaster is a leading model system for elucidating both the mechanisms and evolutionary consequences of female sperm storage and differential male fertilization success. The prominence of Drosophila is due, in part, to the ability to examine processes influencing sperm movement and fate at several biological levels, from molecules to organ systems. In this review, we describe male and female factors, as well as their interactions, involved in female sperm storage and differential male fertilization success.",2012,"Sandra L Schnakenberg, Mark L Siegal, Margaret C Bloch Qazi, Sandra L Schnakenberg, Mark L Siegal, Margaret C Bloch Qazi"
A novel neuronal pathway for visually guided escape in Drosophila melanogaster,19474177,10.1152/jn.00073.2009,"Drosophila melanogaster exhibits a robust escape response to objects approaching on a collision course. Although a pair of large command interneurons called the giant fibers (GFs) have been postulated to trigger such behaviors, their role has not been directly demonstrated. Here, we show that escape from visual stimuli like those generated by approaching predators does not rely on the activation of the GFs and consists of a more complex and less stereotyped motor sequence than that evoked by the GFs. Instead, the timing of escape is tightly correlated with the activity of previously undescribed descending interneurons that signal a threshold angular size of the approaching object. The activity pattern of these interneurons shares features with those of visual escape circuits of several species, including pigeons, frogs, and locusts, and may therefore have evolved under similar constraints. These results show that visually evoked escapes in Drosophila can rely on at least two descending neuronal pathways: the GFs and the novel pathway we characterize electrophysiologically. These pathways exhibit very different patterns of sensory activity and are associated with two distinct motor programs.",2009,"Haleh Fotowat, Amir Fayyazuddin, Hugo J Bellen, Fabrizio Gabbiani, Haleh Fotowat, Amir Fayyazuddin, Hugo J Bellen, Fabrizio Gabbiani"

However, the viability and fertility of the treated embryos could not be fully assessed due to animal licensing laws. Here we assay the viability and fertility of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) embryos in conjunction with the bio-electrospray procedure. Bio-electrosprayed Drosophila embryos developed into fully fertile adult flies that were indistinguishable from wild-type.

First, we describe an enhancer trap marker called R32 that specifically reveals several previously undescribed aspects of the fly's central neuronal pacemakers. We find evidence for a previously unappreciated class of neuronal pacemakers, the lateral posterior neurons (LPNs), and establish anatomical, molecular, and developmental criteria to establish a subclass within the dorsal neuron 1 (DN1) group of pacemakers. Furthermore, we show that the neuropeptide IPNamide is specifically expressed by this DN1 subclass.

The formation of lamellocytes involves the activation of the Toll, the Jun kinase and the JAK/STAT pathways however the minimal requirement for initiation of lamellocyte development in the course of the cellular immune response has not been defined yet. In this study, we tested whether or not the mechanical injury itself, caused by oviposition, could provide a sufficient signal for lamellocyte development. We found that sterile wounding, comparable to that occurring during oviposition, induces normal lamellocyte development. We propose therefore that mechanical damage of the cuticle and subsequent disruption of the basal lamina is a minimal and sufficient single signal for normal lamellocyte development in the course of the cellular immune response of Drosophila.",2005,"Róbert Márkus, Eva Kurucz, Florentina Rus, István Andó, Róbert Márkus, Eva Kurucz, Florentina Rus, István Andó"

To test this hypothesis, we studied in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster overexpressing hsp70 and controls, two behavioral variables (spontaneous locomotor activity and climbing activity) to evaluate the rate of aging, and life span. The results showed that in flies kept in groups, life span was decreased in transgenic flies compared to the parental line, but the contrary was observed in individually kept flies. Hsp70 overexpression had no dramatic effect on life span. Furthermore, we did not detect any advantage of Drosophila overexpressing hsp70 on the two measurements of locomotor activity. These results indicate that the rate of aging in transgenic flies is not different than in non-transgenic lines and that they are not more able to cope with the effects of aging on locomotor activity.",2001,"N Minois, A A Khazaeli, J W Curtsinger, N Minois, A A Khazaeli, J W Curtsinger"
Wingless signaling leads to an asymmetric response to decapentaplegic-dependent signaling during sense organ patterning on the notum of Drosophila melanogaster,10049571,10.1006/dbio.1998.9149,"Wnt and Decapentaplegic cell signaling pathways act synergistically in their contribution to macrochaete (sense organ) patterning on the notum of Drosophila melanogaster. The Wingless-signaling pathway was ectopically activated by removing Shaggy activity (the homologue of vertebrate glycogen synthase kinase 3) in mosaics. Proneural activity is asymmetric within the Shaggy-deficient clone of cells and shows a fixed ""polarity"" with respect to body axis, independent of the precise location of the clone. This asymmetric response indicates the existence in the epithelium of a second signal, which we suggest is Decapentaplegic. Ectopic expression of Decapentaplegic induces extra macrochaetes only in cells which also receive the Wingless signal. Activation of Hedgehog signaling generates a long-range signal which can promote macrochaete formation in the Wingless activity domain. This signal depends upon decapentaplegic function. Autonomous activation of the Wingless signal response in cells causes them to attenuate or sequester this signal. Our results suggest a novel patterning mechanism which determines sense organ positioning in Drosophila.",1999,"R G Phillips, N L Warner, J R Whittle, R G Phillips, N L Warner, J R Whittle"

The ovarian phenotypes produced by females mutant for dominant alleles of the ovo gene are modified in flies with altered doses of other loci involved in germline sex determination in Drosophila (Sex-lethal+, sans fille+ and ovarian tumor+). This observation constitutes the basis for a screen to identify additional genes required for proper establishment of germline sexual identity. We tested 300 deletions, which together cover approximately 58% of the euchromatic portion of the genome, for genetic interactions with ovoD. Hemizygosity for more than a dozen small regions show interactions that either partially suppress or enhance the ovarian phenotypes of females mutant for one or more of the three dominant ovo mutations.

"Flamenco, a gene controlling the gypsy retrovirus of Drosophila melanogaster",7713426,,"Gypsy is an endogenous retrovirus of Drosophila melanogaster. It is stable and does not transpose with detectable frequencies in most Drosophila strains. However, we have characterized unstable strains, known as MG, in which it transposes at high frequency. These stocks contain more copies of gypsy than usual stocks. Transposition results in mutations in several genes such as ovo and cut. They are stable and are due to gypsy insertions. Integrations into the ovoD1 female sterile-dominant mutation result in a null allele of the gene and occurrence of fertile females. This phenomenon, known as the ovoD1 reversion assay, can be used to quantitate gypsy activity. We have shown that the properties of MG strains result from mutation of a host gene that we called flamenco (flam). It has a strict maternal effect on gypsy mobilization: transposition occurs at high frequency only in the germ line of the progeny of females homozygous for mutations of the gene. It is located at position 65.9 (20A1-3) on the X chromosome. The mutant allele present in MG strains is essentially recessive.

Changes in the chromosomal insertion pattern of the copia element during the process of making chromosomes homozygous in Drosophila melanogaster,7862091,10.1007/BF00294683,"In situ hybridization on polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster was used to compare the insertion patterns of copia and mdg1 transposable elements on chromosome 2 in male gametes sampled by two different methods: (i) by crossing the males tested with females from a highly inbred line with known copia and mdg1 insertion profiles; (ii) by crossing the same males with females from a marked strain, and analysing the resulting homozygous chromosomes. Crossing of the males with the inbred line led to homogeneous insertion profiles for both the copia and mdg1 elements in larvae, thus giving an accurate estimation of the patterns in the two gamete classes of each male. Crossing with the marked strain led, however, to heterogeneity in insertion patterns of the copia transposable element, while no significant polymorphism was observed for mdg1. The use of balancer chromosomes is thus not an adequate way of inferring transposable element insertion patterns of Drosophila males, at least for the copia element.

Another construction associating the modified 1731 promoter with the CAT gene is also expressed in Pleurodeles embryos during the same period of development.

Small circular DNA of Drosophila melanogaster: chromosomal homology and kinetic complexity,118461,10.1073/pnas.76.12.6142,Nucleic acid reassociation techniques were used to determine the kinetic complexity of small circular DNA in cultured cells of Drosophila melanogaster. Two kinetic components are present. One of these constitutes 82% of the mass of the circular DNA and has a complexity of 1.8 x 10(4) nucleotide pairs; the other constitutes 18% of the mass and the a significantly higher but undefined sequence complexity. We have demonstrated that these circular molecules hybridize to middle repetitive chromosomal sequences by hybridization of in vitro-labeled circular DNA tracer with a vast excess of Drosophila chromosomal DNA. Thermal stability measurements indicate that base-pair mismatch between small circular DNA and middle repetitive chromosomal DNA does not exceed 2%. We discuss possible functions of these small circular DNAs in light of the above findings.,1979,"S W Stanfield, J A Lengyel, S W Stanfield, J A Lengyel"
[Effect of pulse and prolonged x-rays in air and in nitrogen on the frequency of sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila melanogaster],815129,,"The effect of X-irradiation on the frequency of recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila melanogaster sperm cells is studied. Drosophila males were X-irradiated in air and nitrogen in three units with doses rates of 4 X 10(9), 10(11) and 1.7 rad/sec at a dose of 2000 rad. It is found that the mutation frequency after the pulse irradiation was almost twice as low as that after prolonged irradiation. The oxygen effect is eliminated under pulse irradiation, and the data on pulse irradiation in air are similar to those on irradiation at a low dose rate in nitrogen. The data obtained are explained by the presence of short-lived oxygen-dependent damages which are not realized under pulse irradiation due to the lack of oxygen in the track volume.",1975,"T I Khaĭmovich, T V Stiazhkina, N D Shvarts, T I Khaĭmovich, T V Stiazhkina, N D Shvarts"
The acid phosphatase-1 gene region in the Drosophila species of the subobscura cluster,10364829,10.1111/j.1601-5223.1999.00065.x,"The acid phosphatase-1 (Acph-1) gene region was sequenced in three species of Drosophila: D. subobscura, D. madeirensis and D. guanche. These three closely related species, which are included in the obscura group, form the subobscura cluster. The different functional regions of the gene were identified by similarity with the sequence of D. melanogaster. The structure of Acph-1 is conserved in the four species. Average divergence at synonymous and nonsynonymous sites between D. melanogaster and the species of the subobscura cluster is Ks = 1.1354 and Ka = 0.1743, respectively. The rather high Ka value confirms that ACPH-1 is a rapidly evolving enzyme in Drosophila, as previously suggested by immunological studies. Amino acid replacements are not randomly distributed along the gene. In fact, an excess of replacements is detected in exon I, indicating that the signal peptide encoded by this exon evolves even faster than the rest of the protein. Divergence at the Acph-1 gene region is further evidence that D. madeirensis and D. subobscura are more closely related than D. guanche is to any of them. In addition, both silent divergence in noncoding regions and synonymous divergence in the coding region indicate that the split of the D. guanche lineage is about twice as old as the split of the lineages leading to D. madeirensis and D. subobscura. These phylogenetic relationships are, however, not supported by divergence at nonsynonymous sites since the lowest Ka estimate is between D. guanche and D. subobscura.",1999,"A Navarro-Sabaté, M Aguadé, C Segarra, A Navarro-Sabaté, M Aguadé, C Segarra"
The molecular clock revisited: the rate of synonymous vs. replacement change in Drosophila,9720289,,"Rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution were investigated for 24 genes in three Drosophila species, D. pseudoobscura, D. subobscura, and D. melanogaster. D. pseudoobscura and D. subobscura, two distantly related members of the obscura clade, differ on average by 0.29 synonymous nucleotide substitutions per site. D. melanogaster differs from the two obscura species by an average of 0.81 synonymous substitutions per site. Using a method developed by Gillespie, we investigated the variance to mean ratio, or Index of Dispersion, R, of substitutions along the three species' branches to test the fundamental prediction of the neutral theory of molecular evolution, E(R) = 1. For nonsynonymous substitutions, the average R, Ra is 1.6, which is not significantly different from the neutral theory prediction. Only 5 of the 24 genes had significantly large Ra valves, and 12 of the genes had Ra estimates of less than one. In contrast, the Index of Dispersion for synonymous substitutions was significantly large for 12 of the 24 genes, with an average of R(s) = 4.4, also statistically significant. These findings contrast with results for mammals, which showed overdispersion of nonsynonymous substitutions, but not of synonymous substitutions. Weak selection acting to maintain codon bias in Drosophila, but not in mammals, may be important in explaining the high variance in the rate of synonymous substitutions in this group of organisms.",1998,"L W Zeng, J M Comeron, B Chen, M Kreitman, L W Zeng, J M Comeron, B Chen, M Kreitman"
Redundant cis-acting elements control expression of the Drosophila affinidisjuncta Adh gene in the larval fat body,8165141,10.1093/nar/22.7.1257,"The alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene in the Hawaiian species of fruit fly, Drosophila affinidisjuncta, like the Adh genes from all Drosophila species analyzed, is expressed at high levels in the larval fat body via a larval-specific promoter. To identify the cis-acting elements involved in this highly conserved aspect of Adh gene expression, deleted D. affinidisjuncta genes were introduced into D. melanogaster by somatic transformation. Unlike previously described methods, this transformation system allows analysis of Adh gene expression specifically in the larval fat body. The arrangement of sequences influencing expression of the proximal promoter of this gene in the larval fat body differs markedly from that described for the Adh gene from the distant relative, D. melanogaster. Multiple redundant elements dispersed 5' and 3' to the gene, only some of which map to regions carrying evolutionarily conserved sequences, affect expression in the fat body. D. affinidisjuncta employs a novel mode of Adh gene regulation in which the proximal promoter is influenced by sequences having roles in expression of the distal promoter. This gene is also unique in that far upstream sequences can compensate for loss of sequences within 200 bp of the proximal RNA start site. Furthermore, expression is influenced in an unusual, context-dependent manner by a naturally-occurring 3' duplication of the proximal promoter--a feature found only in Hawaiian species.",1994,"R W McKenzie, J Hu, M D Brennan, R W McKenzie, J Hu, M D Brennan"

Further, advances in genome editing will enable testing of candidate polymorphisms individually and in combination.

Insights into DDT Resistance from the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel,28935691,10.1534/genetics.117.300310,"Insecticide resistance is considered a classic model of microevolution, where a strong selective agent is applied to a large natural population, resulting in a change in frequency of alleles that confer resistance. While many insecticide resistance variants have been characterized at the gene level, they are typically single genes of large effect identified in highly resistant pest species. In contrast, multiple variants have been implicated in DDT resistance in Drosophila melanogaster; however, only the Cyp6g1 locus has previously been shown to be relevant to field populations. Here we use genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify DDT-associated polygenes and use selective sweep analyses to assess their adaptive significance.

Straightforward assay for quantification of social avoidance in Drosophila melanogaster,25549275,10.3791/52011,"Drosophila melanogaster is an emerging model to study different aspects of social interactions. For example, flies avoid areas previously occupied by stressed conspecifics due to an odorant released during stress known as the Drosophila stress odorant (dSO). Through the use of the T-maze apparatus, one can quantify the avoidance of the dSO by responder flies in a very affordable and robust assay. Conditions necessary to obtain a strong performance are presented here. A stressful experience is necessary for the flies to emit dSO, as well as enough emitter flies to cause a robust avoidance response to the presence of dSO. Genetic background, but not their group size, strongly altered the avoidance of the dSO by the responder flies. Canton-S and Elwood display a higher performance in avoiding the dSO than Oregon and Samarkand strains. This behavioral assay will allow identification of mechanisms underlying this social behavior, and the assessment of the influence of genes and environmental conditions on both emission and avoidance of the dSO. Such an assay can be included in batteries of simple diagnostic tests used to identify social deficiencies of mutants or environmental conditions of interest.",2014,"Robert W Fernandez, Marat Nurilov, Omar Feliciano, Ian S McDonald, Anne F Simon, Robert W Fernandez, Marat Nurilov, Omar Feliciano, Ian S McDonald, Anne F Simon"

To address this, we used Drosophila as a model animal to examine the effects of FDRJ in multicellular organisms. When flies were reared on food supplemented with FDRJ, the developmental time from larva to adult was shortened, the adult male lifespan was prolonged, and female fecundity was increased without any significant morphological alterations. Moreover, the expression of dilp5, an insulin-like peptide, its receptor InR, and the nutrient sensing molecule TOR, the target of rapamycin, was significantly increased in FDRJ-fed female flies as compared with ones reared on standard and on protein-enriched food.

Genetic correlations between life span and early fecundity are not significantly different from zero, but correlations with midlife fecundity are positive and statistically significant. Long-lived genotypes exhibit a midlife fecundity peak. There is no evidence for a shift of reproductive effort from early to later stages. The existence of qualitatively recombinant phenotypes, including ""superflies"" that exhibit both enhanced survival and high levels of early fecundity, argues against the widespread idea that life history evolution in Drosophila is dominated by negative pleiotropy.

Osmotic regulation in adult Drosophila melanogaster during dehydration and rehydration,15159436,10.1242/jeb.01024,"We have examined the osmoregulatory capacities of laboratory populations of the insect Drosophila melanogaster by measuring hemolymph osmotic concentration during desiccation and upon recovery from a bout of desiccation. Recovery treatments entailed allowing the flies access to distilled water, a saline solution or a saline+sucrose solution after a desiccation bout shown to reduce hemolymph volume by approximately 60%. Prior to desiccation, the hemolymph osmotic concentration was 353+/-11 mOsm. We found that Drosophila display strict osmotic regulation under prolonged conditions of dehydration. Osmotic regulation continued during recovery from desiccation, regardless of the fluid provided. This result is evidence that this insect does not require an external source of osmolytes or energy to regulate its hemolymph osmotic concentration or to restore hemolymph volume, which is reduced during desiccation. We also examined populations that have been selected for over 250 generations for enhanced desiccation resistance to identify physiological characters that have evolved in response to the selection regime.

Measurements were made of reproductive success, oviposition rate, and preadult survival of insects on artificial diets containing tryptamine, its precursor tryptophan, as well as glycine and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine). Drosophila reproduction was reduced to 15% of controls when adult insects mated and the young were allowed to develop on medium containing 75 mM tryptamine. Tryptamine-induced depression in reproductive success was due to decreased oviposition rate and preadult survival. Serotonin, but not tryptophan or glycine, also reduced oviposition rate. Preference tests indicated that tryptamine may act as an antiattractant or antifeedant in this species. The accumulation of the indole alkaloid tryptamine in plants may provide a mechanism for reducing insect reproduction, which is potentially useful in protecting crop plants.",1998,"J C Thomas, E F Saleh, N Alammar, A M Akroush, J C Thomas, E F Saleh, N Alammar, A M Akroush"

Desipramine and imipramine were clearly genotoxic at concentrations above 1 mM whereas amitriptyline, nortriptyline and protriptyline were not genotoxic at concentrations up to 100 mM.

Glutamine synthetase II is more active than glutamine synthetase I in the transferase assay, while the opposite is true in the biosynthetic assay.

Metabolic rate and hypoxia tolerance are affected by group interactions and sex in the fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster): new data and a literature survey,28202465,10.1242/bio.023994,"Population density and associated behavioral adjustments are potentially important in regulating physiological performance in many animals.

Additionally, insects often show marked sexual dimorphism (larger females). Thus, in this study on D. melanogaster, we characterized the effects of fly density and sex on both mass-specific routine oxygen consumption (V̇O2) and hypoxia tolerance (PCrit).

Sargassum fusiforme Fucoidan SP2 Extends the Lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster by Upregulating the Nrf2-Mediated Antioxidant Signaling Pathway,31485301,10.1155/2019/8918914,"Damage accumulated in the genome and macromolecules is largely attributed to increased oxidative damage and a lack of damage repair in a cell, and this can eventually trigger the process of aging. Alleviating the extent of oxidative damage is therefore considered as a potential way to promote longevity. SFPS, a heteropolysaccharide extracted from the brown alga Sargassum fusiforme, has previously been shown to alleviate oxidative damage during the aging process in mice, but whether SFPS could extend the lifespan of an organism was not demonstrated. Furthermore, the precise component within SFPS that is responsible for the antioxidant activity and the underlying mechanism of such activity was also not resolved. In this study, SP2, a fucoidan derived from SFPS, was shown to exhibit strong antioxidant activity as measured by in vitro radical-scavenging assays. SP2 also improved the survival rate of D. melanogaster subjected to oxidative stress. The flies that were fed with a diet containing SP2 from the time of eclosion displayed significant enhancement in lifespan and reduced accumulation of triglyceride at the old-age stage. In addition, SP2 markedly improved the activities of the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and reduced the contents of the malondialdehyde (MDA) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in old flies. Furthermore, SP2 also upregulated the expression levels of the nuclear factor-erythroid-2-like 2 (nfe2l2 or nrf2) and its downstream target genes, accompanied by a dramatic reduction in the expression of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (keap1, a canonical inhibitor of the Nrf2) in old flies. Additional support linking the crucial role of the Nrf2/ARE pathway to the antioxidant effect of SP2 was the relatively high survival rate under heat stress for D. melanogaster individuals receiving SP2 supplement, an effect that was abolished by the inclusion of inhibitors specific for the Nrf2/ARE pathway.

In a recent publication, we developed a new behavioral arena that eliminates handling of flies prior to, during and after fights to study the learning and memory associated with aggression. We compared two handling procedures commonly used in laboratories to study aggression with the new chambers and demonstrated that handling negatively influences aggression and prevents ""loser"" effect formation.

Automated identification of social interaction criteria in Drosophila melanogaster,25354920,10.1098/rsbl.2014.0749,"The study of social behaviour within groups has relied on fixed definitions of an 'interaction'. Criteria used in these definitions often involve a subjectively defined cut-off value for proximity, orientation and time (e.g. courtship, aggression and social interaction networks) and the same numerical values for these criteria are applied to all of the treatment groups within an experiment. One universal definition of an interaction could misidentify interactions within groups that differ in life histories, study treatments and/or genetic mutations. Here, we present an automated method for determining the values of interaction criteria using a pre-defined rule set rather than pre-defined values. We use this approach and show changing social behaviours in different manipulations of Drosophila melanogaster. We also show that chemosensory cues are an important modality of social spacing and interaction. This method will allow a more robust analysis of the properties of interacting groups, while helping us understand how specific groups regulate their social interaction space.",2014,"J Schneider, J D Levine, J Schneider, J D Levine"

In moderate hypoxia, these effects appear to occur without ATP limitation and are instead mediated by signaling systems, including hypoxia-inducible factor and atypical guanyl cyclase sensing of oxygen, with downstream actions on behavior, anabolism, and the cell cycle. In hypoxia, flies develop smaller sizes, but size does not evolve, whereas in hyperoxia, flies evolve larger sizes without exhibiting developmental size plasticity, suggesting differential evolutionary responses to natural versus novel directions of oxygen change.",2011,"Jon F Harrison, Gabriel G Haddad, Jon F Harrison, Gabriel G Haddad"
"[Adaptive response comparison of CBA mice splenocyte and Drosophila melanogaster larva neuroblast, developed in conditions of chronic gamma-irradiation influence with low-dose rate]",20143578,,"The level of DNA damage and apoptosis of mice splenocytes, developed in condition of chronic gamma-irradiation with low-doze rate (8 +/- 2 cGy), in response to high-dose irradiation (2 Gy) in the completion of irradiation, as well in 30 minutes after irradiation was analysed. Reaction of neuroblasts of Drosophila melanogaster larvae (4 cGy - priming dose, 3 and 6 Gy--challenging doses) is also investigated. The adaptive response by the level of DNA-damage is shown for both objects. This resistance is presumably connected to increase of DNA-damage repair efficiency in preirradiated objects, as well promotion of sensitivity to apoptosis (in the case of Drosophila larvae neuroblast).

Rubus fruit juices affect lipid peroxidation in a Drosophila melanogaster model in vivo,16190624,10.1021/jf051303l,"The antioxidant capacity of red cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus) juice correlates well with its phenolic content. The red berries have a markedly higher content of anthocyanins, particularly cyanidin and pelargonidin derivatives, than that found in the more common yellow fruit. Conversely, the yellow juice has higher ellagitannin content. A feeding study was conducted to show the in vivo effects of the juices on lipid peroxidation in a sensitive Drosophila melanogaster stock. In young female flies there were significant (P < 0.01) effects of cloudberry juice on lipid peroxidation. In young male flies significant (P < 0.05) effects were found on primary products (hydroxyperoxides) with yellow juice and on secondary products (ketodienes) with red juice. With the red juice, a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in ketodienes was found in both young and old males.

Our work elucidates the role of DIP1 which is a novel protein that we found in Drosophila. We performed a two-hybrid system assay and identified the L27a protein as an interactor of DIP1. The interaction was then validated by in vitro binding assays. DIP1, similar to other nuclear proteins in eukaryotes, is localized to the nuclear periphery and chromatin domain in all nuclei, but disappears at the metaphase. It is possible that in D.m.

Drosophila sex-lethal inhibits the stable association of the 40S ribosomal subunit with msl-2 mRNA,12769862,10.1016/s1097-2765(03)00176-x,The inhibition of male-specific lethal-2 (msl-2) mRNA translation in female flies is essential for X chromosome dosage compensation in Drosophila melanogaster. Translational repression of msl-2 requires sex-lethal (SXL) binding to uridine-rich sequences in both the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of the message. We delineate the msl-2 mRNA sequence elements that are important for regulation by SXL and identify functionally critical sequences adjacent to regulatory SXL binding sites. We demonstrate that SXL inhibits translation initiation and prevents the stable association of the 40S ribosomal subunit with the mRNA in a manner that does not require the presence of a cap structure at the 5' end of the mRNA. These results elucidate a critical regulatory step for dosage compensation in Drosophila melanogaster.,2003,"Fátima Gebauer, Marica Grskovic, Matthias W Hentze, Fátima Gebauer, Marica Grskovic, Matthias W Hentze"
Regions of lower crossing over harbor more rare variants in African populations of Drosophila melanogaster,11404330,,"A correlation between diversity levels and rates of recombination is predicted both by models of positive selection, such as hitchhiking associated with the rapid fixation of advantageous mutations, and by models of purifying selection against strongly deleterious mutations (commonly referred to as ""background selection""). With parameter values appropriate for Drosophila populations, only the first class of models predicts a marked skew in the frequency spectrum of linked neutral variants, relative to a neutral model. Here, we consider 29 loci scattered throughout the Drosophila melanogaster genome. We show that, in African populations, a summary of the frequency spectrum of polymorphic mutations is positively correlated with the meiotic rate of crossing over. This pattern is demonstrated to be unlikely under a model of background selection. Models of weakly deleterious selection are not expected to produce both the observed correlation and the extent to which nucleotide diversity is reduced in regions of low (but nonzero) recombination. Thus, of existing models, hitchhiking due to the recurrent fixation of advantageous variants is the most plausible explanation for the data.",2001,"P Andolfatto, M Przeworski, P Andolfatto, M Przeworski"

Increases in energy reserves, including proline, were found in lines of flies selected for resistance to chilling injury. Since an increase in proline levels has been associated with overwintering in insects, and for salt and cold tolerance in plants, an RNase protection assay was developed to assess changes in transcript abundance for two genes encoding enzymes important for proline metabolism, pyrroline 5-carboxylate reductase and proline oxidase. The mRNA levels did not change in response to low temperature, but the high level of pyrroline 5-carboxylate reductase transcript is consistent with the interpretation that a large proline pool is important for Drosophila metabolism and survival during cold stress.",2001,"S R.

Wild-type third instar larvae move in straighter paths than larvae of the same age homozygous for the y mutation. At 96 h of age, the tracks of y larvae have 10 times as many loops as tracks of wild-type larvae, and at 120 h of age, y larvae show bending behavior about 2.5 times more frequently than do wild-type. Consequently, they do not disperse as much as wild-type larvae. Concomitant with the behavioral changes, the larvae present a defect in the morphology of large chaetae in the larval denticle belts, particularly of 2nd and 3rd instars, both with light and scanning electron microscopes.

[Critical periods in the development of mutants in scute Drosophila melanogaster],829401,,Thermosensitive periods of the development of germs of separate pairs of macrochaetae were studied in two lines of mutation of scute Drosophila melanogaster (y/sc4B and cs7). The experiments have revealed the following three features which had not been observed earlier in similar investigations in other mutants of drosophila: 1) change of thermosensitivity in mutants sc7 in different periods of ontogenesis; 2) different sensitivity in mutants of both lines in different critical periods of the same pair of macrochaetae; 3) discrete sensitivity of separate macrochaetae in mutants of both lines at different stages of oogenesis when there are no germs of these organs yet. The change of penetrability of the mutation of scute for scuttellar macrochaetae in mutants y/sc4B caused by the 90-minute-long heating of larvae on the 4th day of their life (critical period of development) is inherited in 15 observed generations of the maternal line.

Host searching and host preference of resident pupal parasitoids of Drosophila suzukii in the invaded regions,32687647,10.1002/ps.6013,"Background:
      
    

    
      In its invaded regions, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) is a novel host for the community of resident parasitoids of Drosophila. To attain a high parasitization rate on the novel host, the parasitoids have to locate it and accept it in the presence of other Drosophila hosts. We conducted a laboratory choice experiment and a semifield trial to investigate host searching and host preference of the three pupal parasitoid species Trichopria drosophilae (Perkins), Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae (Rondani) and Spalangia erythromera Förster.

Strong and weak cross-sex correlations govern the quantitative-genetic architecture of social group choice in Drosophila melanogaster,31769501,10.1111/evo.13887,"When genotypes differ in niche-constructing traits, genotypes are expected to differ in which environments they experience, providing a novel causal relationship between genotypes, environments, and behavior. Such genetic variation in niche construction (or, more precisely, environment construction) is predicted to be especially important for social environments, yet the quantitative-genetic parameters governing such variation are still poorly understood. Here, we examine genetic variation and cross-sex genetic correlations for social environment-constructing behaviors. We focus on whether genetic variation in patch use-the tendency to spend time near food patches where conspecifics may be present-and group-size preference-the specific group size chosen when individuals are affiliating-is correlated or decoupled across sexes in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Across three choice treatments, we find genotype and sex differences in how much time individuals spend near patches, and which group sizes they prefer. We find that the genetic basis of patch use is strongly coupled across sexes, whereas the genetic basis of group-size preference is completely decoupled across sexes. We discuss how these findings augment and complicate our understanding of the evolutionary genetics of social behaviors.",2020,"Adam P Geiger, Julia B Saltz, Adam P Geiger, Julia B Saltz"

We here present a relatively simple protocol to assess the key aspects of the polymicrobial interaction in vivo between the human opportunistic pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, which is based on the systemic infection by needle pricking at the dorsal thorax of the flies. After infection, fly survival and bacteremia over time for both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus within the infected flies can be monitored as a measure of polymicrobial virulence potential. The infection takes ~24 h including bacterial cultivation. Fly survival and bacteremia are assessed using the infected flies that are monitored up to ~60 h post-infection.

Images taken with the aid of focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (EM) at 20 nm intervals across olfactory glomerulus DA2 revealed that some synaptic boutons are penetrated by protrusions emanating from other neurons. Similar structures in the brain of mammals are known as synaptic spinules. A survey with transmission EM (TEM) disclosed that these structures are frequent throughout the antennal lobe. Detailed neuronal tracings revealed that spinules are formed by all three major types of neurons innervating glomerulus DA2 but the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) receive significantly more spinules than other olfactory neurons. Double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) that appear to represent material that has pinched-off from spinules are also most abundant in presynaptic boutons of OSNs. Inside the host neuron, a close association was observed between spinules, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. We propose that by releasing material into the host neuron, through a process triggered by synaptic activity and analogous to axonal pruning, synaptic spinules could function as a mechanism for synapse tagging, synaptic remodeling and neural plasticity.

Short and long-lasting behavioral consequences of agonistic encounters between male Drosophila melanogaster,27071097,10.1073/pnas.1520953113,"In many animal species, learning and memory have been found to play important roles in regulating intra- and interspecific behavioral interactions in varying environments. In such contexts, aggression is commonly used to obtain desired resources. Previous defeats or victories during aggressive interactions have been shown to influence the outcome of later contests, revealing loser and winner effects. In this study, we asked whether short- and/or long-term behavioral consequences accompany victories and defeats in dyadic pairings between male Drosophila melanogaster and how long those effects remain. The results demonstrated that single fights induced important behavioral changes in both combatants and resulted in the formation of short-term loser and winner effects. These decayed over several hours, with the duration depending on the level of familiarity of the opponents. Repeated defeats induced a long-lasting loser effect that was dependent on de novo protein synthesis, whereas repeated victories had no long-term behavioral consequences. This suggests that separate mechanisms govern the formation of loser and winner effects.

No apparent cost of evolved immune response in Drosophila melanogaster,26932243,10.1111/evo.12896,"Maintenance and deployment of the immune system are costly and are hence predicted to trade-off with other resource-demanding traits, such as reproduction. We subjected this longstanding idea to test using laboratory experimental evolution approach. In the present study, replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster were subjected to three selection regimes-I (Infection with Pseudomonas entomophila), S (Sham-infection with MgSO4 ), and U (Unhandled Control). After 30 generations of selection flies from the I regime had evolved better survivorship upon infection with P. entomophila compared to flies from U and S regimes. However, contrary to expectations and previous reports, we did not find any evidence of trade-offs between immunity and other life history related traits, such as longevity, fecundity, egg hatchability, or development time. After 45 generations of selection, the selection was relaxed for a set of populations. Even after 15 generations, the postinfection survivorship of populations under relaxed selection regime did not decline. We speculate that either there is a negligible cost to the evolved immune response or that trade-offs occur on traits such as reproductive behavior or other immune mechanisms that we have not investigated in this study. Our research suggests that at least under certain conditions, life-history trade-offs might play little role in maintaining variation in immunity.",2016,"Vanika Gupta, Saudamini Venkatesan, Martik Chatterjee, Zeeshan A Syed, Vaishnavi Nivsarkar, Nagaraj G Prasad, Vanika Gupta, Saudamini Venkatesan, Martik Chatterjee, Zeeshan A Syed, Vaishnavi Nivsarkar, Nagaraj G Prasad"
Efficient Estimation of Mutation Rates during Individual Development by Minimization of Chi-Square,26266814,10.1371/journal.pone.0135398,"Mutation primarily occurs when cells divide and it is highly desirable to have knowledge of the rate of mutations for each of the cell divisions during individual development. Recently, recessive lethal or nearly lethal mutations which were observed in a large mutation accumulation experiment using Drosophila melanogaster suggested that mutation rates vary significantly during the germline development of male Drosophila melanogaster. The analysis of the data was based on a combination of the maximum likelihood framework with numerical assistance from a newly developed coalescent algorithm. Although powerful, the likelihood based framework is computationally highly demanding which limited the scope of the inference. This paper presents a new estimation approach by minimizing chi-square statistics which is asymptotically consistent with the maximum likelihood method. When only at most one mutation in a family is considered the minimization of chi-square is simplified to a constrained weighted minimum least square method which can be solved easily by optimization theory. The new methods effectively eliminates the computational bottleneck of the likelihood. Reanalysis of the published Drosophila melanogaster mutation data results in similar estimates of mutation rates. The new method is also expected to be applicable to the analysis of mutation data generated by next-generation sequencing technology.",2015,"Shi-Meng Ai, Jian-Jun Gao, Shu-Qun Liu, Yun-Xin Fu, Shi-Meng Ai, Jian-Jun Gao, Shu-Qun Liu, Yun-Xin Fu"
Specific combinations of boundary element and Polycomb response element are required for the regulation of the Hox genes in Drosophila melanogaster,26254901,10.1016/j.mod.2015.07.016,"In the bithorax complex of Drosophila melanogaster, the chromatin boundary elements (BE) demarcate cis-regulatory domains that regulate Hox genes along the anteroposterior body axis.

The relevance of such specific genomic arrangements of regulatory elements remains unclear. Deletions of individual BE-PRE combination result in distinct homeotic phenotypes. In this study, we show that deletion of two such BE-PRE combinations in cis leads to new genetic interactions, which manifests as dorsal closure defect phenotype in adult abdominal epithelia. We further demonstrate that dorsal closure phenotype results from enhanced and ectopic expression of Hox gene Abd-B in the larval epithelial cells. This suggests a specific role of multiple BE-PRE combinations in the larval epithelial cells for regulation of Abd-B. Using chromosome conformation capture experiments, we show that genetic interactions correlate with direct physical interactions among the BE-PRE combinations.

Although some changes in life extensity in males were identified (the effect of hormesis after the exposure to 5, 10 and 40 cGy) as well as in females (the effect of hormesis after the exposure to 5 and 40 cGy), they were not caused by the organism ""physiological"" changes.

The identified changes in gene expression are not dose-dependent, there is not any proportionality between dose and its impact on expression.

Gel-free mass spectrometry analysis of Drosophila melanogaster heads,26201256,10.1002/pmic.201500092,"Membrane proteins play key roles in several fundamental biological processes such as cell signalling, energy metabolism and transport. Despite the significance, these still remain an under-represented group in proteomics datasets. Herein, a bottom-up approach to analyse an enriched membrane fraction from Drosophila melanogaster heads using multidimensional liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem-mass spectrometry (MS/MS) that relies on complete solubilisation and digestion of proteins, is reported. An enriched membrane fraction was prepared using equilibrium density centrifugation on a discontinuous sucrose gradient, followed by solubilisation using the filter-aided sample preparation (FASP), tryptic and sequential chymotryptic digestion of proteins. Peptides were separated by reversed-phase (RP) LC at high pH in the first dimension and acidic RP-LC in the second dimension coupled directly to an Orbitrap Velos Pro mass spectrometer. A total number of 4812 proteins from 114 865 redundant and 38 179 distinct peptides corresponding to 4559 genes were identified in the enriched membrane fraction from fly heads.

Quantitative genetics of learning ability and resistance to stress in Drosophila melanogaster,25691979,10.1002/ece3.1379,"Even though laboratory evolution experiments have demonstrated genetic variation for learning ability, we know little about the underlying genetic architecture and genetic relationships with other ecologically relevant traits. With a full diallel cross among twelve inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster originating from a natural population (0.75 < F < 0.93), we investigated the genetic architecture of olfactory learning ability and compared it to that for another behavioral trait (unconditional preference for odors), as well as three traits quantifying the ability to deal with environmental challenges: egg-to-adult survival and developmental rate on a low-quality food, and resistance to a bacterial pathogen. Substantial additive genetic variation was detected for each trait, highlighting their potential to evolve. Genetic effects contributed more than nongenetic parental effects to variation in traits measured at the adult stage: learning, odorant perception, and resistance to infection. In contrast, the two traits quantifying larval tolerance to low-quality food were more strongly affected by parental effects. We found no evidence for genetic correlations between traits, suggesting that these traits could evolve at least to some degree independently of one another.

In an attempt to bridge this gap, here we describe the effects of age, sex, genotype, and their interactions on high-sensitivity metabolomic profiles in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Among the 6800 features analyzed, we found that over one-quarter of all metabolites were significantly associated with age, sex, genotype, or their interactions, and multivariate analysis shows that individual metabolomic profiles are highly predictive of these traits. Using a metabolomic equivalent of gene set enrichment analysis, we identified numerous metabolic pathways that were enriched among metabolites associated with age, sex, and genotype, including pathways involving sugar and glycerophospholipid metabolism, neurotransmitters, amino acids, and the carnitine shuttle.

A comparison of the experimental and theoretical data for various pairwise combinations of the above-mentioned factors was made. It was shown that the intensity of data obtained by the ChiP-chip method significantly differs outside and inside identified clusters. A comparison of experimental data in various pairwise combinations of the factors showed that, despite the problems associated with a great noise in the ChiP-chip signal, a strong tendency of particular groups of factors to bind in the same DNA regions was revealed, which is consistent with the data about their functional coupling.

After 24h after egg deposition (h AED), a simple tube-like organ is formed, consisting of essentially only two cell types, the contractile cardioblasts and non-myogenic pericardial cells. In contrast to the detailed knowledge of heart formation during embryogenesis, only a few studies deal with later changes in heart morphology and/or function. This is mainly due to the difficulties to carry out whole mount stainings in later stages without complicated dissections or treatments of the cuticle and puparium. In this paper we describe the identification of a hand genomic region, which is fully sufficient to drive GFP expression in heart cells of embryos, larvae, and adults. This serves as an initial step to understand the position of hand in the early regulatory network in heart development. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our newly created GFP reporter line is extremely useful to study postembryonic heart differentiation.

Structural insights into the neuroprotective-acting carbonyl reductase Sniffer of Drosophila melanogaster,15364585,10.1016/j.jmb.2004.08.020,"In vivo studies with the fruit-fly Drosophila melanogaster have shown that the Sniffer protein prevents age-dependent and oxidative stress-induced neurodegenerative processes. Sniffer is a NADPH-dependent carbonyl reductase belonging to the enzyme family of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs). The crystal structure of the homodimeric Sniffer protein from Drosophila melanogaster in complex with NADP+ has been determined by multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion and refined to a resolution of 1.75 A. The observed fold represents a typical dinucleotide-binding domain as detected for other SDRs. With respect to the cofactor-binding site and the region referred to as substrate-binding loop, the Sniffer protein shows a striking similarity to the porcine carbonyl reductase (PTCR). This loop, in both Sniffer and PTCR, is substantially shortened compared to other SDRs. In most enzymes of the SDR family this loop adopts a well-defined conformation only after substrate binding and remains disordered in the absence of any bound ligands or even if only the dinucleotide cofactor is bound. In the structure of the Sniffer protein, however, the conformation of this loop is well defined, although no substrate is present.

Atypical granules in the eyes of the white mutant of Drosophila melanogaster are lysosome-related organelles,8391698,10.1111/j.1600-0749.1993.tb00585.x,"In the pigment cells of the white mutant of Drosophila melanogaster, as described earlier, two types of abnormal granules are found by conventional electron microscopy. However, both types of abnormal granules, in addition to those in pigment cell invaginations, are also present in the cytoplasm of the photoreceptor cells. Three enzymes (acid phosphatase, peroxidase, and tyrosinase) are localized within the eyes of wild type and white mutant Drosophila melanogaster by electron microscopy. Peroxidase activity is present in lamellar bodies close to the rhabdomeral microvilli of both fly types. However the organelles containing peroxidase activity are 6-fold more frequent in the wild type than in the mutant. Acid phosphatase is present in lamellar bodies between and at the bases of the rhabdomeral microvilli of the wild type, as well as in ommochrome granules of the photoreceptor cells. In the white mutant, however, acid phosphatase was located in electron lucent vacuoles in the cytoplasm of the receptor cells. These acid phosphatase-positive vacuoles also contained both types of abnormal granules. The latter result indicates that abnormal granules in the receptor cells originate from lysosomal degradation and that targeting of lysosomal enzymes is altered in the white mutant. Due to the tyrosinase activity in the hemolymph of flies, the extracellular spaces are electron dense after DOPA incubation. Since some abnormal granules within the photoreceptor cells are not surrounded by an extracellular space, they can be assumed to originate within the photoreceptor cells.",1993,"U Schraermeyer, M Dohms, U Schraermeyer, M Dohms"

In mature egg-shells wax forms a hydrophobic layer surrounding the oocyte and lying between, and in very close contact with the vitelline membrane (interiorly) and the crystalline intermediate chorionic layer (exteriorly). In cross-fractured views it is less than 50 A thick whereas in longitudinal fracturing it reveals smooth fracture faces of a multilayered material in the form of hydrophobic areas or plaques (0.5-1 microns in diameter) which are partially overlapping and highly compressed between the vitelline membrane and the innermost chorionic layer. The evidence for this layer being a wax are the facts that a) it is not preserved in conventional fat-extracting electron microscopy methods, b) it directs laterally the fracture planes during freeze-fracturing and reveals smooth fracture faces. Analysis of the structural features of wax in mature egg-shell in various species of Drosophilidae have shown that the wax layer exhibits indistinguishable (among the species) hydrophobic plaques, which have the same size and thickness with Drosophila melanogaster. These data provide structural evidence explaining the physiological resistance of the insect eggs studied, against water loss or water uptake, whenever they are laid on substrates with extreme environmental conditions.

Purification and properties of the enzymes from Drosophila melanogaster that catalyze the synthesis of sepiapterin from dihydroneopterin triphosphate,114165,10.1007/BF00498976,"Sepiapterin synthase, the enzyme system responsible for the synthesis of sepiapterin from dihydroneopterin triphosphate, has been partially purified from extracts of the heads of young adult fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). The sepiapterin synthase system consists of two components, termed ""enzyme A"" (MW 82,000) and ""enzyme B"" (MW 36,000). Some of the properties of the enzyme system are as follows: NADPH and a divalent cation, supplied most effectively as MgCl2, are required for activity; optimal activity occurs are pH 7.4 and 30 C; the Km for dihydroneopterin triphosphate is 10 microM; and a number of unconjugated pterins, including biopterin and sepiapterin, are inhibitory. Dihydroneopterin cannot be used as substrate in place of dihydroneopterin triphosphate. Evidence is presented in support of a proposed reaction mechanism for the enzymatic conversion of dihydroneopterin triphosphate to sepiapterin in which enzyme A catalyzes the production of a labile intermediate by nonhydrolytic elimination of the phosphates of dihydroneopterin triphosphate, and enzyme B catalyzes the conversion of this intermediate, in the presence of NADPH, to sepiapterin. An analysis of the activity of sepiapterin synthase during development in Drosophila revealed the presence of a small amount of activity in eggs and young larvae and a much larger amount in late pupae and young adults. Sepiapterin synthase activity during development corresponds with the appearance of sepiapterin in the flies. Of a variety of eye color mutants of Drosophila melanogaster tested for sepiapterin synthase activity, only purple (pr) flies contained activity that was significantly lower than that found in the wild-type flies (22% of the wild-type activity). Further studies indicated that the amount of enzyme A activity is low in purple flies, whereas the amount of enzyme B activity is equal to that present in wild-type flies.",1979,"G G Krivi, G M Brown, G G Krivi, G M Brown"
Conservation of the Notch antagonist Hairless in arthropods: functional analysis of the crustacean Daphnia pulex Hairless gene,28861687,10.1007/s00427-017-0593-4,"The Notch signaling pathway is highly conserved in all animal metazoa: upon Notch receptor activation, transcription of Notch target genes is turned on by an activator complex that centers on the transcription factor CSL. In the absence of signal, CSL assembles transcriptional repression complexes that display remarkable evolutionary diversity. The major antagonist of Notch signaling in insects named Hairless was originally identified in Drosophila melanogaster. It binds to the Drosophila CSL homologue Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] and recruits the two general co-repressors, Groucho and C-terminal binding protein. Whereas the majority of Notch signaling components is conserved between insects and vertebrates, Hairless is found only in insects. Here, we present the analysis of the Hairless gene from Daphnia pulex and, hence, for the first time from a crustacean. Daphnia and Drosophila Hairless protein sequences are highly diverged. Known functional domains, however, the Su(H), Groucho and the C-terminal binding protein interactions domains, are well conserved. Moreover, direct binding of the Daphnia Hairless protein and the respective Drosophila interaction partners was detected, demonstrating the conservation at the molecular level. In addition, interaction between Daphnia Hairless and Drosophila Su(H) was demonstrated in vivo, as co-overexpression of the respective genes during Drosophila development resulted in the expected downregulation of Notch activity in the fly. Structural models show that the Hairless-Su(H) repressor complexes from Daphnia and Drosophila are almost indistinguishable from one another.

Microsomes of Drosophila were active in the hydratation of styrene oxide catalyzed by epoxide hydratase. The post-microsomal supernatant of Drosophila catalyzed the conjugation of GSH with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. However, GSH S-transferase activity with styrene oxide as the electrophilic substrate was not measurable. The respective specific activities of epoxide hydratase (per mg microsomal protein) and GSH S-transferase (per mg cytosolic protein) were factors of 5- and 10-fold lower than the corresponding activities in rat liver. However, when expressed per gram body weight, activities of both epoxide hydratase and GSH S-transferase were 3 times higher for Drosophila enzymes. The apparent Km values for the two Drosophila enzymes were higher, whereas the apparent Km values were lower, than the values found for the rat-liver enzymes. Among 3 different Drosophila strains (a wild-type, a white eye-color carrying mutant strain and a DDT-resistant strain), preliminary experiments showed no differences as far as these two enzymic activities were concerned.

Barium-sensitive K(+) conductances are found on the basolateral membrane of a variety of insect Malpighian (renal) tubules, including Drosophila melanogaster. We found that barium decreases the lumen-positive transepithelial potential difference in isolated perfused Drosophila tubules and decreases fluid secretion and transepithelial K(+) flux. In those insect species in which it has been studied, transcripts from multiple genes encoding inwardly rectifying K(+) channels are expressed in the renal (Malpighian) tubule. In Drosophila melanogaster, this includes transcripts of the Irk1, Irk2, and Irk3 genes. The role of each of these gene products in renal tubule function is unknown. We found that simultaneous knockdown of Irk1 and Irk2 in the principal cell of the fly tubule decreases transepithelial K(+) flux, with no additive effect of Irk3 knockdown, and decreases barium sensitivity of transepithelial K(+) flux by ∼50%. Knockdown of any of the three inwardly rectifying K(+) channels individually has no effect, nor does knocking down Irk3 simultaneously with Irk1 or Irk2. Irk1/Irk2 principal cell double-knockdown tubules remain sensitive to the kaliuretic effect of cAMP. Inhibition of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase with ouabain and Irk1/Irk2 double knockdown have additive effects on K(+) flux, and 75% of transepithelial K(+) transport is due to Irk1/Irk2 or ouabain-sensitive pathways.

On the possibility of death of new genes - evidence from the deletion of de novo microRNAs,29792159,10.1186/s12864-018-4755-1,"Background:
      
    

    
      New genes are constantly formed, sometimes from non-genic sequences, creating what is referred to as de novo genes. Since the total number of genes remains relatively steady, gene deaths likely balance out new births. In metazoan genomes, microRNAs (miRs) genes, small and non-coding, account for the bulk of functional de novo genes and are particularly suited to the investigation of gene death.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In this study, we discover a Drosophila-specific de novo miRNA (mir-977) that may be facing impending death. Strikingly, after this testis-specific gene is deleted from D. melanogaster, most components of male fitness increase, rather than decrease as had been expected. These components include male viability, fertility and males' ability to repress female re-mating. Given that mir-977 has a negative fitness effect in D. melanogaster, this de novo gene with an adaptive history for over 60 Myrs may be facing elimination. In some other species where mir-977 is not found, gene death may have already happened.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:

Parallel and costly changes to cellular immunity underlie the evolution of parasitoid resistance in three Drosophila species,29049362,10.1371/journal.ppat.1006683,"A priority for biomedical research is to understand the causes of variation in susceptibility to infection. To investigate genetic variation in a model system, we used flies collected from single populations of three different species of Drosophila and artificially selected them for resistance to the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi, and found that survival rates increased 3 to 30 fold within 6 generations. Resistance in all three species involves a large increase in the number of the circulating hemocytes that kill parasitoids. However, the different species achieve this in different ways, with D. melanogaster moving sessile hemocytes into circulation while the other species simply produce more cells. Therefore, the convergent evolution of the immune phenotype has different developmental bases. These changes are costly, as resistant populations of all three species had greatly reduced larval survival. In all three species resistance is only costly when food is in short supply, and resistance was rapidly lost from D. melanogaster populations when food is restricted. Furthermore, evolving resistance to L. boulardi resulted in cross-resistance against other parasitoids. Therefore, whether a population evolves resistance will depend on ecological conditions including food availability and the presence of different parasite species.",2017,"John E McGonigle, Alexandre B Leitão, Sarah Ommeslag, Sophie Smith, Jonathan P Day, Francis M Jiggins, John E McGonigle, Alexandre B Leitão, Sarah Ommeslag, Sophie Smith, Jonathan P Day, Francis M Jiggins"
RNA editing differently affects protein-coding genes in D. melanogaster and H. sapiens,26169954,10.1038/srep11550,"When an RNA editing event occurs within a coding sequence it can lead to a different encoded amino acid. The biological significance of these events remains an open question: they can modulate protein functionality, increase the complexity of transcriptomes or arise from a loose specificity of the involved enzymes. We analysed the editing events in coding regions that produce or not a change in the encoded amino acid (nonsynonymous and synonymous events, respectively) in D. melanogaster and in H. sapiens and compared them with the appropriate random models. Interestingly, our results show that the phenomenon has rather different characteristics in the two organisms. For example, we confirm the observation that editing events occur more frequently in non-coding than in coding regions, and report that this effect is much more evident in H. sapiens. Additionally, in this latter organism, editing events tend to affect less conserved residues. The less frequently occurring editing events in Drosophila tend to avoid drastic amino acid changes.

Recent selection on synonymous codon usage in Drosophila,10473775,10.1007/pl00006557,"Evidence from a variety of sources indicates that selection has influenced synonymous codon usage in Drosophila. It has generally been difficult, however, to distinguish selection that acted in the distant past from ongoing selection. However, under a neutral model, polymorphisms usually reflect more recent mutations than fixed differences between species and may, therefore, be useful for inferring recent selection. If the ancestral state is preferred, selection should shift the frequency distribution of derived states/site toward lower values; if the ancestral is unpreferred, selection should increase the number of derived states/site. Polymorphisms were classified as ancestrally preferred or unpreferred for several genes of D. simulans and D. melanogaster. A computer simulation of coalescence was employed to derive the expected frequency distributions of derived states/site under various modifications of the Wright-Fisher neutral model, and distributions of test statistics (t and Mann-Whitney U) were derived by appropriate sampling. One-tailed tests were applied to transformed frequency data to assess whether the two frequency distributions deviated from neutral expectations in the direction predicted by selection on codon usage. Several genes from D. simulans appear to be subject to recent selection on synonymous codons, including one gene with low codon bias, esterase-6. Selection may also be acting in D. melanogaster.",1999,"R M Kliman, R M Kliman"

Transposition of mobile genetic elements in interspecific hybrids of Drosophila,6126320,10.1007/BF00330360,"In situ hybridization of labeled DNA of four mobile dispersed genetic elements (mdg), isolated from D. melanogaster and C. virilis genomes, with polytene chromosomes of the larvae of several Drosophila species has been carried out. The data show that the mdg elements exhibit a high degree of species specificity. The same conclusions are derived from filter hybridization using 32P-labeled D. melanogaster and D. virilis DNA and cloned mdg sequences immobilized on nitrocellulose filters. We attempted to induce transpositions (""jumping"") of mdg elements specific for D. virilis chromosomes to the chromosomes of related species (e.g. D. littoralis Meigen) originally lacking the representatives of this family of repeats. For this purpose we produced hybrid stocks with ""synthetic"" karyotoypes characterized by different combinations of D. virilis homologous chromosomes and ""hybrid"" chromosomes. In one of such stocks we did find by in situ hybridization the insertion of a D. virilis mdg element into the fifth chromosome of D. littoralis Meigen. The transposition (""jumping"") took place in the only region where somatic pairing between the fifth chromosomes of D. virilis and D. littoralis occurs more or less regularly in the hybrids. Since crossing-over in hybrid chromosomes of males is excluded in such ""synthetic"" stocks, gene conversion may be responsible for this transposition. The possible bearing of the phenomenon observed on the problem of hybrid dysgenesis is discussed.",1982,"M B Evgen'ev, G N Yenikolopov, N I Peunova, Y V Ilyin, M B Evgen'ev, G N Yenikolopov, N I Peunova, Y V Ilyin"
Circadian and rhythmic-related behavioral co-morbidities of the diabetic state in Drosophila melanogaster,32240709,10.1016/j.ygcen.2020.113477,"Circadian phenomena rule many activities of life on earth. Disruptions in circadian rhythmicity and rhythms have been recognized as a contributing factor for diseased states, for instance metabolic disruptions like diabetes. Diabetes develops as a consequence of faulty insulin pathway signaling, either by lack of insulin production (diabetes type I), or by loss of responsiveness in target tissues (diabetes type 2). In this work we use the model organism Drosophila melanogaster with three different mutant hypomorphic conditions at different levels of the insulin pathway. The insulin pathway is a very evolutionarily conserved pathway. We study these different diabetic conditions as a source of circadian rhythm abnormalities and circadian-related co-morbidities. We do so by studying circadian rhythmicity, activity, sleep and sleep structure, and feeding behavior. Results show that flies with impaired insulin signaling show circadian rhythm and rhythmic-related co-morbidities, especially female flies, as a consequence of the diabetic state. The most extreme disruptions occur in flies with impaired insulin receptor signaling, which stands at the beginning of the insulin pathway, in principle affecting most if not all aspects of this pathway. Our work shows that defective insulin signaling is a source of circadian rhythm and rhythmic related co-morbidities.",2020,"Jessica Paloma Álvarez-Rendón, Juan Rafael Riesgo-Escovar, Jessica Paloma Álvarez-Rendón, Juan Rafael Riesgo-Escovar"
Drosophila melanogaster: A Valuable Genetic Model Organism to Elucidate the Biology of Retinitis Pigmentosa,30324448,10.1007/978-1-4939-8669-9_16,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a complex inherited disease. It is associated with mutations in a wide variety of genes with many different functions. These mutations impact the integrity of rod photoreceptors and ultimately result in the progressive degeneration of rods and cone photoreceptors in the retina, leading to complete blindness. A hallmark of this disease is the variable degree to which symptoms are manifest in patients. This is indicative of the influence of the environment, and/or of the distinct genetic makeup of the individual.The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has effectively proven to be a great model system to better understand interconnected genetic networks. Unraveling genetic interactions and thereby different cellular processes is relatively easy because more than a century of research on flies has enabled the creation of sophisticated genetic tools to perturb gene function. A remarkable conservation of disease genes across evolution and the similarity of the general organization of the fly and vertebrate photoreceptor cell had prompted research on fly retinal degeneration. To date six fly models for RP, including RP4, RP11, RP12, RP14, RP25, and RP26, have been established, and have provided useful information on RP disease biology. In this chapter, an outline of approaches and experimental specifications are described to enable utilizing or developing new fly models of RP.",2019,"Malte Lehmann, Elisabeth Knust, Sarita Hebbar, Malte Lehmann, Elisabeth Knust, Sarita Hebbar"
Exposure of Drosophila melanogaster to Mancozeb Induces Oxidative Damage and Modulates Nrf2 and HSP70/83,30116484,10.1155/2018/5456928,"Mancozeb (MZ), a manganese- and zinc-containing ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamate, is a broad-spectrum fungicide. Harmful effects of this fungicide have been reported in nontarget organisms via a not fully understood mechanism. Drosophila melanogaster has provided remarkable contributions for toxicological studies. This work was aimed at evaluating the biochemical targets and implication of oxidative stress in MZ-mediated toxicity in drosophilas. Exposure of flies for fifteen days to MZ at 5 and 10 mg/mL through the diet impaired locomotor performance and induced fly mortality. In parallel, it caused lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and Mn overload. MZ inhibited superoxide dismutase and inducted catalase and glutathione S-transferase activities. Nitric oxide and reduced glutathione levels were significantly decreased by MZ. Heat shock proteins (HSP70 and HSP83) and Nrf2 mRNA levels were significantly augmented in MZ-exposed flies. Our study reinforced the use of Drosophila melanogaster as a reliable model for the study of biochemical targets of pesticides, and based on our data, MZ induced oxidative damage and Mn accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner.

Azadirachtin acting as a hazardous compound to induce multiple detrimental effects in Drosophila melanogaster,30048948,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.07.057,"Azadirachtin, a tetranortriterpenoid botanical insecticide, has varied sub-lethal effects against many insect pests, including antifeedant, repellent, and growth regulatory. Despite extensive studies of the mechanisms that underline these physiological effects, little attention has been given to multiple toxic effects of azadirachtin under a coherent concentration, and there is no definitive overarching consensus on its toxicity. Here, we investigated multiple sub-lethal effects induced by 4 mg L-1 of azadirachtin, which did not elicit antifeedant behavior in Drosophila melanogaster, on metrics of longevity, development, compound eyes and reproduction. Exposure to <20 mg L-1 azadirachtin did not induce mortality, and 4 mg L-1 of azadirachtin could shorten lifespan, expression of detoxification genes and activities of related detoxification enzymes were higher. The lower activity of chitinase and higher content of chitin in fruit fly exposed to 4 mg L-1 azadirachtin could be important in developmental inhibition effects, and ovarian abnormalities and lower fecundity could have resulted from azadirachtin-mediated influences on juvenile hormone and ecdysone that disrupted the endocrine system. Caspase-3, head involution defective and reaper-dependent apoptosis genes may have been responsible for compound eye abnormalities in flies exposed to azadirachtin.

Epigenetic factors Polycomb (Pc) and Suppressor of zeste (Su(z)2) negatively regulate longevity in Drosophila melanogaster,29177687,10.1007/s10522-017-9737-1,"The process of aging is a hallmark of the natural life span of all organisms and individuals within a population show variability in the measures of age related performance. Longevity and the rate of aging are influenced by several factors such as genetics, nutrition, stress, and environment. Many studies have focused on the genes that impact aging and there is increasing evidence that epigenetic factors regulate these genes to control life span. Polycomb (PcG) and trithorax (trxG) protein complexes maintain the expression profiles of developmentally important genes and regulate many cellular processes. Here, we report that mutations of PcG and trxG members affect the process of aging in Drosophila melanogaster, with perturbations mostly associated with retardation in aging. We find that mutations in polycomb repressive complex (PRC1) components Pc and Su(z)2 increase fly survival. Using an inducible UAS-GAL4 system, we show that this effect is tissue-specific; knockdown in fat body, but not in muscle or brain tissues, enhances life span. We hypothesize that these two proteins influence life span via pathways independent of their PRC1 functions, with distinct effects on response to oxidative stress. Our observations highlight the role of global epigenetic regulators in determining life span.",2018,"Vasanthi Dasari, Surabhi Srivastava, Shagufta Khan, Rakesh K Mishra, Vasanthi Dasari, Surabhi Srivastava, Shagufta Khan, Rakesh K Mishra"
A test for Y-linked additive and epistatic effects on surviving bacterial infections in Drosophila melanogaster,28510293,10.1111/jeb.13118,"Y- and W-chromosomes offer a theoretically powerful way for sexual dimorphism to evolve. Consistent with this possibility, Drosophila melanogaster Y-chromosomes can influence gene regulation throughout the genome; particularly immune-related genes. In order for Y-linked regulatory variation (YRV) to contribute to adaptive evolution it must be comprised of additive genetic variance, such that variable Ys induce consistent phenotypic effects within the local gene pool. We assessed the potential for Y-chromosomes to adaptively shape gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial defence by introgressing Ys across multiple genetic haplotypes from the same population. We found no Y-linked additive effects on immune phenotypes, suggesting a restricted role for the Y to facilitate dimorphic evolution. We did find, however, a large magnitude Y by background interaction that induced rank order reversals of Y-effects across the backgrounds (i.e. sign epistasis). Thus, Y-chromosome effects appeared consistent within backgrounds, but highly variable among backgrounds. This large sign epistatic effect could constrain monomorphic selection in both sexes, considering that autosomal alleles under selection must spend half of their time in a male background where relative fitness values are altered. If the pattern described here is consistent for other traits or within other XY (or ZW) systems, then YRV may represent a universal constraint to autosomal trait evolution.",2017,"I C Kutch, K M Fedorka, I C Kutch, K M Fedorka"

Mutations of conserved arginine mutants within the alpha-crystallin domain (ACD) domain (R105G, R109G, and R110G) were introduced, and their effects on oligomerization and chaperone function were assessed. Arginine to glycine mutations do not induce significant changes in tryptophan fluorescence, and the mutated proteins form oligomers that are of equal or smaller size than the wild-type protein. They all form oligomer with one single peak as determined by size exclusion chromatography. While all mutants demonstrate the same efficiency as the DmHsp22WT in a DTT-induced insulin aggregation assay, all are more efficient chaperones to prevent aggregation of malate dehydrogenase. Arginine mutants of DmHsp22 are efficient chaperones to retard aggregation of CS and Luc. In summary, this study shows that mutations of arginine to glycine in DmHsp22 ACD induce a number of structural changes, some of which differ from those described in mammalian sHsps. Interestingly, only the R110G-DmHsp22 mutant, and not the expected R109G equivalent to human R140-HspB1, R116-HspB4, and R120-HspB5, showed different structural properties compared with the DmHsp22WT.",2017,"Afrooz Dabbaghizadeh, Stéphanie Finet, Genevieve Morrow, Mohamed Taha Moutaoufik, Robert M Tanguay, Afrooz Dabbaghizadeh, Stéphanie Finet, Genevieve Morrow, Mohamed Taha Moutaoufik, Robert M Tanguay"
The Ih Channel Gene Promotes Synaptic Transmission and Coordinated Movement in Drosophila melanogaster,28286469,10.3389/fnmol.2017.00041,"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated ""HCN"" channels, which underlie the hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih), have been proposed to play diverse roles in neurons. The presynaptic HCN channel is thought to both promote and inhibit neurotransmitter release from synapses, depending upon its interactions with other presynaptic ion channels. In larvae of Drosophila melanogaster, inhibition of the presynaptic HCN channel by the drug ZD7288 reduces the enhancement of neurotransmitter release at motor terminals by serotonin but this drug has no effect on basal neurotransmitter release, implying that the channel does not contribute to firing under basal conditions. Here, we show that genetic disruption of the sole HCN gene (Ih) reduces the amplitude of the evoked response at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of third instar larvae by decreasing the number of released vesicles. The anatomy of the (NMJ) is not notably affected by disruption of the Ih gene. We propose that the presynaptic HCN channel is active under basal conditions and promotes neurotransmission at larval motor terminals. Finally, we demonstrate that Ih partial loss-of-function mutant adult flies have impaired locomotion, and, thus, we hypothesize that the presynaptic HCN channel at the (NMJ) may contribute to coordinated movement.",2017,"Andrew P Hegle, C Andrew Frank, Anthony Berndt, Markus Klose, Douglas W Allan, Eric A Accili, Andrew P Hegle, C Andrew Frank, Anthony Berndt, Markus Klose, Douglas W Allan, Eric A Accili"

Its fungicidal activity depends primarily on its binding to the sterol group that is present in fungal membranes. In view of the toxicity of this drug, the purpose of this study was to evaluate its mutagenic, carcinogenic, and recombinogenic activity, based on the wing somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) and the epithelial tumor detection test (wts) applied to Drosophila melanogaster. Larvae were chronically treated with different concentrations of AmB (0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 mg/mL). The results revealed that AmB is a promutagen exhibiting increase in the number of spots on individuals from high bioactivation (HB) cross with a high level of cytochrome P450. The results also indicate that the main genotoxic event induced by AmB is recombinogenicity. Homologous recombination can act as a determinant at different stages of carcinogenesis.

The Gyc76C Receptor Guanylyl Cyclase and the Foraging cGMP-Dependent Kinase Regulate Extracellular Matrix Organization and BMP Signaling in the Developing Wing of Drosophila melanogaster,26440503,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005576,"The developing crossveins of the wing of Drosophila melanogaster are specified by long-range BMP signaling and are especially sensitive to loss of extracellular modulators of BMP signaling such as the Chordin homolog Short gastrulation (Sog). However, the role of the extracellular matrix in BMP signaling and Sog activity in the crossveins has been poorly explored. Using a genetic mosaic screen for mutations that disrupt BMP signaling and posterior crossvein development, we identify Gyc76C, a member of the receptor guanylyl cyclase family that includes mammalian natriuretic peptide receptors. We show that Gyc76C and the soluble cGMP-dependent kinase Foraging, likely linked by cGMP, are necessary for normal refinement and maintenance of long-range BMP signaling in the posterior crossvein. This does not occur through cell-autonomous crosstalk between cGMP and BMP signal transduction, but likely through altered extracellular activity of Sog. We identify a novel pathway leading from Gyc76C to the organization of the wing extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteinases, and show that both the extracellular matrix and BMP signaling effects are largely mediated by changes in the activity of matrix metalloproteinases. We discuss parallels and differences between this pathway and other examples of cGMP activity in both Drosophila melanogaster and mammalian cells and tissues.",2015,"Justin Schleede, Seth S Blair, Justin Schleede, Seth S Blair"

Stage-specific effects of candidate heterochronic genes on variation in developmental time along an altitudinal cline of Drosophila melanogaster,20585460,10.1371/journal.pone.0011229,"Background:
      
    

    
      Previously, we have shown there is clinal variation for egg-to-adult developmental time along geographic gradients in Drosophila melanogaster. Further, we also have identified mutations in genes involved in metabolic and neurogenic pathways that affect development time (heterochronic genes). However, we do not know whether these loci affect variation in developmental time in natural populations.
    

    
  


        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      Here, we constructed second chromosome substitution lines from natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster from an altitudinal cline, and measured egg-adult development time for each line. We found not only a large amount of genetic variation for developmental time, but also positive associations of the development time with thermal amplitude and altitude. We performed genetic complementation tests using substitution lines with the longest and shortest developmental times and heterochronic mutations. We identified segregating variation for neurogenic and metabolic genes that largely affected the duration of the larval stages but had no impact on the timing of metamorphosis.

Analysis of epithelial K(+) transport in Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster: evidence for spatial and temporal heterogeneity,11507112,,"Transport of K(+) by the lower, main and distal segments of the Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster was analyzed using self-referencing K(+)-selective microelectrodes. Transport properties of the Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster change along their length. Self-referencing ion-selective (SeRIS) microelectrode measurements (relative to the bath concentration of 20 mmoll(-1)) showed a 1% reduction (P<0.05) of [K(+)] in the unstirred layer adjacent to the main segment of the Malpighian tubules, confirming secretion of K(+) from the bath to the tubule lumen. Conversely, SeRIS measurements showed a 0.7% increase (P<0.05) in [K(+)] in the unstirred layer adjacent to the lower segment of Malpighian tubules, confirming reabsorption of K(+) from the luminal fluid to the bath. Measurements using SeRIS also showed that the distal segment neither secreted nor reabsorbed K(+). There was pronounced spatial heterogeneity in K(+) transport by the lower segment and the main segment; not all morphologically similar cells participated equally in K(+) transport, nor did all main segment cells respond equally to stimulation of K(+) transport by cyclic AMP. Pronounced temporal heterogeneity in K(+) reabsorption by the lower Malpighian tubules was also observed. We suggest that this reflects periodic reduction in K(+) reabsorption due to retention of fluid within the lower segment when the ureter contracts.",2001,"M R Rheault, M J O'Donnell, M R Rheault, M J O'Donnell"

Although mxc can be classified among the Polycomb group (Pc-G) of genes, negative trans-regulators of the ANT-C and BX-C gene complexes, germline requirement for mxc appears independent of a need for other Pc-C gene products, and mxc gonad phenotypes are different from those induced by mutations in BX-C genes.

On the role of transient depolarization-activated K + current in microvillar photoreceptors,30049678,10.1085/jgp.201711940,"Photoreceptors in the compound eyes of most insect species express two functional types of depolarization-activated potassium currents: a transient A-type current (IA) and a sustained delayed rectifier current (IDR). The role of Shaker-dependent IA in Drosophila melanogaster photoreceptors was previously investigated by comparing intracellular recordings from Shaker and wild-type photoreceptors. Shaker channels were proposed to be involved in low-frequency signal amplification in dim light and reduction of the metabolic cost of information transfer. Here, I study the function of IA in photoreceptors of the cockroach Panchlora nivea using the patch-clamp method. Responses to Gaussian white-noise stimuli reveal that blockade of IA with 4-aminopyridine has no discernible effect on voltage responses or information processing. However, because open-channel blockers are often ineffective at low membrane potentials, no conclusion on the role of IA could be made on the basis of negative results of pharmacological tests. Using a relatively large set of control data, a physiological variability analysis was performed to discern the role of IA. Amplitudes of the IA window current and half-activation potentials correlate strongly with membrane corner frequencies, especially in dim light, indicating that IA facilitates transmission of higher frequencies. Consistent with voltage-dependent inactivation of IA, these correlations decrease with depolarization in brighter backgrounds. In contrast, correlations involving IDR are comparatively weak. Upon reexamining photoreceptor conductance in wild-type and Shaker strains of D. melanogaster, I find a biphasic voltage dependence near the resting potential in a minority of photoreceptors from both strains, indicating that Shaker channels are not crucial for early amplification of voltage signals in D. melanogaster photoreceptors. Leak current in Shaker photoreceptors at the level of the soma is not elevated. These results suggest a novel role for IA in facilitating transmission of high-frequency signals in microvillar photoreceptors.",2018,"Roman V Frolov, Roman V Frolov"

        Results:
      
    

    
      We identified four candidate genes that contributed to differences in TAG storage between two strains of D. melanogaster, including Laminin A (LanA), which is a member of the alpha subfamily of laminin chains. We confirmed the effects of this gene using a viable LanA mutant and showed that female flies homozygous for the mutation had significantly lower TAG storage, body weight, and total protein content than control flies. Drosophila LanA is closely related to human LAMA5 gene, which maps to the well-replicated obesity-linkage region on chromosome 20q13.2-q13.3. We tested for association between three common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human LAMA5 gene and variation in body composition and lipid profile traits in a cohort of unrelated women of European American (EA) and African American (AA) descent. In both ethnic groups, we found that SNP rs659822 was associated with weight (EA: P = 0.008; AA: P = 0.05) and lean mass (EA: P= 0.003; AA: P = 0.03).

As with Drosophila and Apis, Tribolium possesses ion channels gated by acetylcholine, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), glutamate and histamine as well as orthologs of the Drosophila pH-sensitive chloride channel subunit (pHCl), CG8916 and CG12344. Similar to Drosophila and Apis, Tribolium cys-loop LGIC diversity is broadened by alternative splicing although the beetle orthologs of RDL and GluCl possess more variants of exon 3. Also, RNA A-to-I editing was observed in two Tribolium nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits, Tcasalpha6 and Tcasbeta1. Editing in Tcasalpha6 is evolutionarily conserved with D. melanogaster, A. mellifera and Heliothis virescens, whereas Tcasbeta1 is edited at a site so far only observed in the beetle.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our findings reveal that in diverse insect species the cys-loop LGIC superfamily has remained compact with only minor changes in gene numbers. However, alternative splicing, RNA editing and the presence of divergent subunits broadens the cys-loop LGIC proteome and generates species-specific receptor isoforms. These findings on Tribolium castaneum enhance our understanding of cys-loop LGIC functional genomics and provide a useful basis for the development of improved insecticides that target an important agricultural pest.",2007,"Andrew K Jones, David B Sattelle, Andrew K Jones, David B Sattelle"
3D analysis of human islet amyloid polypeptide crystalline structures in Drosophila melanogaster,31600260,10.1371/journal.pone.0223456,"Expression of the Alzheimer's disease associated polypeptide Aβ42 and the human polypeptide hormon islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) and the prohormone precursor (hproIAPP) in neurons of Drosophila melanogaster leads to the formation of protein aggregates in the fat body tissue surrounding the brain. We determined the structure of these membrane-encircled protein aggregates using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and observed the dissolution of protein aggregates after starvation. Electron tomography (ET) as an extension of transmission electron microscopy revealed that these aggregates were comprised of granular subunits having a diameter of 20 nm aligned into highly ordered structures in all three dimensions. The three dimensional (3D) lattice of hIAPP granules were constructed of two unit cells, a body centered tetragonal (BCT) and a triclinic unit cell. A 5-fold twinned structure was observed consisting of the cyclic twinning of the BCT and triclinic unit cells. The interaction between the two nearest hIAPP granules in both unit cells is not only governed by the van der Waals forces and the dipole-dipole interaction but potentially also by filament-like structures that can connect the nearest neighbors. Hence, our 3D structural analysis provides novel insight into the aggregation process of hIAPP in the fat body tissue of Drosophila melanogaster.",2019,"Ling Xie, Xiaohong Gu, Kenta Okamoto, Gunilla T Westermark, Klaus Leifer, Ling Xie, Xiaohong Gu, Kenta Okamoto, Gunilla T Westermark, Klaus Leifer"
Evolution Under Dietary Restriction Decouples Survival From Fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster Females,29718269,10.1093/gerona/gly070,"One of the key tenets of life-history theory is that reproduction and survival are linked and that they trade-off with each other. When dietary resources are limited, reduced reproduction with a concomitant increase in survival is commonly observed. It is often hypothesized that this dietary restriction effect results from strategically reduced investment in reproduction in favor of somatic maintenance to survive starvation periods until resources become plentiful again. We used experimental evolution to test this ""waiting-for-the-good-times"" hypothesis, which predicts that selection under sustained dietary restriction will favor increased investment in reproduction at the cost of survival because ""good-times"" never come. We assayed fecundity and survival of female Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies that had evolved for 50 generations on three different diets varying in protein content-low (classic dietary restriction diet), standard, and high-in a full-factorial design. High-diet females evolved overall increased fecundity but showed reduced survival on low and standard diets. Low-diet females evolved reduced survival on low diet without corresponding increase in reproduction. In general, there was little correspondence between the evolution of survival and fecundity across all dietary regimes. Our results contradict the hypothesis that resource reallocation between fecundity and somatic maintenance underpins life span extension under dietary restriction.",2019,"Felix Zajitschek, Grigorios Georgolopoulos, Anna Vourlou, Maja Ericsson, Susanne R K Zajitschek, Urban Friberg, Alexei A Maklakov, Felix Zajitschek, Grigorios Georgolopoulos, Anna Vourlou, Maja Ericsson, Susanne R K Zajitschek, Urban Friberg, Alexei A Maklakov"
Sex and Genetic Background Influence Superoxide Dismutase (cSOD)-Related Phenotypic Variation in Drosophila melanogaster,28624774,10.1534/g3.117.043836,"Mutations often have drastically different effects in different genetic backgrounds; understanding a gene's biological function then requires an understanding of its interaction with genetic diversity. The antioxidant enzyme cytosolic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (cSOD) catalyzes the dismutation of the superoxide radical, a molecule that can induce oxidative stress if its concentration exceeds cellular control. Accordingly, Drosophila melanogaster lacking functional cSOD exhibit a suite of phenotypes including decreased longevity, hypersensitivity to oxidative stress, impaired locomotion, and reduced NADP(H) enzyme activity in males. To date, cSOD-null phenotypes have primarily been characterized using males carrying one allele, cSodn108red, in a single genetic background. We used ANOVA, and the effect size partial eta squared, to partition the amount of variation attributable to cSOD activity, sex, and genetic background across a series of life history, locomotor, and biochemical phenotypes associated with the cSOD-null condition. Overall, the results demonstrate that the cSOD-null syndrome is largely consistent across sex and genetic background, but also significantly influenced by both. The sex-specific effects are particularly striking and our results support the idea that phenotypes cannot be considered to be fully defined if they are examined in limited genetic contexts.",2017,"Courtney E Lessel, Tony L Parkes, Joel Dickinson, Thomas J S Merritt, Courtney E Lessel, Tony L Parkes, Joel Dickinson, Thomas J S Merritt"
Rosemary Extract-Mediated Lifespan Extension and Attenuated Oxidative Damage in Drosophila melanogaster Fed on High-Fat Diet,28241105,10.1111/1750-3841.13656,"Rosemary extract has a potent antioxidant activity and is widely used in the food industry. In this study, the lifespan prolonging and antioxidant activity of rosemary extract was evaluated by high-fat-induced oxidative damage in Drosophila melanogaster. The results revealed that the lifespan and climbing ability of fruit flies was enhanced significantly by feeding rosemary extract. Furthermore, feeding with rosemary extract significantly increased the enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and significantly decreased the level of malonaldehyde. The gene expression of SOD, CAT, and nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 was enhanced and that for methuselah was significantly reduced. The comet assay showed that high-fat diet-induced DNA lesion was significantly reduced in larvae treated with the rosemary extract.

Genetic Variation in Taste Sensitivity to Sugars in Drosophila melanogaster,28164220,10.1093/chemse/bjw165,"Taste sensitivity plays a major role in controlling feeding behavior, and alterations in feeding habit induced by changes in taste sensitivity can drive speciation. We investigated variability in taste preferences in wild-derived inbred lines from the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel. Preferences for different sugars, which are essential nutrients for fruit flies, were assessed using two-choice preference tests that paired glucose with fructose, sucrose, or trehalose. The two-choice tests revealed that individual lines have differential and widely variable sugar preferences, and that sugar taste sensitivity is polygenic in the inbred population tested. We focused on 2 strains that exhibited opposing preferences for glucose and fructose, and performed proboscis extension reflex tests and electrophysiological recordings on taste sensilla upon exposure to fructose and glucose. The results indicated that taste sensitivity to fructose is dimorphic between the 2 lines. Genetic analysis showed that high sensitivity to fructose is autosomal dominant over low sensitivity, and that multiple loci on chromosomes 2 and 3 influence sensitivity. Further genetic complementation tests for fructose sensitivity on putative gustatory receptor (Gr) genes for sugars suggested that the Gr64a-Gr64f locus, not the fructose receptor gene Gr43a, might contribute to the dimorphic sensitivity to fructose between the 2 lines.",2017,"Shun Uchizono, Teiichi Tanimura, Shun Uchizono, Teiichi Tanimura"
A genome-wide scan for genes under balancing selection in Drosophila melanogaster,28086750,10.1186/s12862-016-0857-z,"Background:
      
    

    
      In the history of population genetics balancing selection has been considered as an important evolutionary force, yet until today little is known about its abundance and its effect on patterns of genetic diversity. Several well-known examples of balancing selection have been reported from humans, mice, plants, and parasites. However, only very few systematic studies have been carried out to detect genes under balancing selection. We performed a genome scan in Drosophila melanogaster to find signatures of balancing selection in a derived (European) and an ancestral (African) population. We screened a total of 34 genomes searching for regions of high genetic diversity and an excess of SNPs with intermediate frequency.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In total, we found 183 candidate genes: 141 in the European population and 45 in the African one, with only three genes shared between both populations. Most differences between both populations were observed on the X chromosome, though this might be partly due to false positives. Functionally, we find an overrepresentation of genes involved in neuronal development and circadian rhythm. Furthermore, some of the top genes we identified are involved in innate immunity.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:

The corticotropin-releasing factor-like diuretic hormone 44 (DH44) and kinin neuropeptides modulate desiccation and starvation tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster,26896569,10.1016/j.peptides.2016.02.004,"Malpighian tubules are critical organs for epithelial fluid transport and stress tolerance in insects, and are under neuroendocrine control by multiple neuropeptides secreted by identified neurons. Here, we demonstrate roles for CRF-like diuretic hormone 44 (DH44) and Drosophila melanogaster kinin (Drome-kinin, DK) in desiccation and starvation tolerance. Gene expression and labelled DH44 ligand binding data, as well as highly selective knockdowns and/or neuronal ablations of DH44 in neurons of the pars intercerebralis and DH44 receptor (DH44-R2) in Malpighian tubule principal cells, indicate that suppression of DH44 signalling improves desiccation tolerance of the intact fly. Drome-kinin receptor, encoded by the leucokinin receptor gene, LKR, is expressed in DH44 neurons as well as in stellate cells of the Malpighian tubules. LKR knockdown in DH44-expressing neurons reduces Malpighian tubule-specific LKR, suggesting interactions between DH44 and LK signalling pathways. Finally, although a role for DK in desiccation tolerance was not defined, we demonstrate a novel role for Malpighian tubule cell-specific LKR in starvation tolerance. Starvation increases gene expression of epithelial LKR. Also, Malpighian tubule stellate cell-specific knockdown of LKR significantly reduced starvation tolerance, demonstrating a role for neuropeptide signalling during starvation stress.",2016,"Elizabeth Cannell, Anthony J Dornan, Kenneth A Halberg, Selim Terhzaz, Julian A T Dow, Shireen-A Davies, Elizabeth Cannell, Anthony J Dornan, Kenneth A Halberg, Selim Terhzaz, Julian A T Dow, Shireen-A Davies"

The gene encoding for NDPK from Drosophila melanogaster was amplified from the genomic DNA. The recombinant NDPK (rNDPK) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by Ni-NTA agarose affinity chromatography, HiTrap SP HP cation exchange chromatography and HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography. The gel filtration chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation showed that rNDPK was a trimer in solution. The binding affinity of NDPs with rNDPK, measured by isothermal titration calorimetry, indicated that the purines nucleotides show higher binding affinity compared with pyrimidines. The rNDPK had a definite nuclease activity in vitro, which could cleave supercoiled plasmid DNA, but had no effect on dsDNA and ssDNA. Furthermore, the structure for NDPK was determined by using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. In the final model, the asymmetric unit is made of three molecules, each of which consists of a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheets and seven α-helices.

Transcriptional response to dietary restriction in Drosophila melanogaster,24819200,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2014.05.002,"Dietary restriction (DR) extends lifespan in a wide variety of organisms. Although several genes and pathways associated with this longevity response have been identified, the specific mechanism through which DR extends lifespan is not fully understood. We have recently developed a novel methodology to screen for transcriptional changes in response to acutely imposed DR upon adult Drosophila melanogaster and identified groups of genes that switch their transcriptional patterns from a normal diet pattern to a restricted diet pattern, or 'switching genes'. In this current report we extend our transcriptional data analysis with gene set enrichment analysis to generate a pathway-centered perspective. The pattern of temporal behavior in response to the diet switch is strikingly similar within and across pathways associated with mRNA processing and protein translation. Furthermore, most genes within these pathways display an initial spike in activity within 6-8h from the diet switch, followed by a coordinated, partial down-regulation after 24h. We propose this represents a stereotypical response to DR, which ultimately leads to a mild but widespread inhibition of transcriptional and translational activity. Inhibition of the protein synthesis pathway has been observed in DR in other studies and has been shown to extend lifespan in several model organisms.",2014,"Feifei Ding, M Pilar Gil, Michael Franklin, Jonathan Ferreira, Marc Tatar, Stephen L Helfand, Nicola Neretti, Feifei Ding, M Pilar Gil, Michael Franklin, Jonathan Ferreira, Marc Tatar, Stephen L Helfand, Nicola Neretti"
The role of reduced oxygen in the developmental physiology of growth and metamorphosis initiation in Drosophila melanogaster,24259256,10.1242/jeb.093120,"Rearing oxygen level is known to affect final body size in a variety of insects, but the physiological mechanisms by which oxygen affects size are incompletely understood. In Manduca sexta and Drosophila melanogaster, the larval size at which metamorphosis is initiated largely determines adult size, and metamorphosis is initiated when larvae attain a critical mass. We hypothesized that oxygen effects on final size might be mediated by oxygen effects on the critical weight and the ecdysone titers, which regulate growth rate and the timing of developmental transitions. Our results showed that oxygen affected critical weight, the basal ecdysone titers and the timing of the ecdysone peak, providing clear evidence that oxygen affected growth rate and developmental rate. Hypoxic third instar larvae (10% oxygen) exhibited a reduced critical weight, slower growth rate, delayed pupariation, elevated baseline ecdysone levels and a delayed ecdysone peak that occurred at a lower larval mass. Hyperoxic larvae exhibited increased basal ecdysone levels, but no change in critical weight compared with normoxic larvae and no significant change in timing of pupariation. Previous studies have shown that nutrition is crucial for regulating growth rate and the timing of developmental transitions. Here we show that oxygen level is one of multiple cues that together regulate adult size and the timing and dynamics of growth, developmental rate and ecdysone signaling.",2013,"Viviane Callier, Alexander W Shingleton, Colin S Brent, Shampa M Ghosh, Jinkyu Kim, Jon F Harrison, Viviane Callier, Alexander W Shingleton, Colin S Brent, Shampa M Ghosh, Jinkyu Kim, Jon F Harrison"

A series of novel organophosphorous-homodimers were designed and synthesized based on the dual-site structure characteristics of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The compounds were evaluated in vitro for their inhibitory activity to AChE extracted from Drosophila melanogaster and Musca domestic. Compound 4H showed an excellent inhibitor activity to both Drosophila melanogaster and Musca domestic with the corresponding IC(50) values of 23 and 168 nM, respectively. Meanwhile, its activities against Drosophila melanogaster and Musca domestic AChE were more than 10,00,000 and 100,000-fold higher compared with the parent compound (MH), and was up to 245 and 107-fold higher than those of the positive control omethoate. The molecular docking study revealed that 4H possessed an optimal spacer length and can perfectly fit into the central pocket, active gorge, and peripheral site of DmAChE, and consequently exhibited highly improved inhibitor potency to DmAChE. The bioassay tests showed that 4 series compounds showed prominent insecticidal activities against both Lipaphser erysimi and Tetranychus cinnbarinus at a concentration of 200mg/L.

Drosophila melanogaster and Eucypris virens giant spermatozoa as visualized by cell inclusion in microgels,17397067,10.1002/jez.a.355,"A new technique, based on live Sperm Inclusion in Microgels (SIM), allows quick and easy analysis of giant spermatozoa under bright field or fluorescence microscopy. The technique has been assayed on Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera) and Eucypris virens (Ostracoda) spermatozoa and based on the inclusion of freshly obtained male gametes in low melting agarose microgels at 37 degrees C to prevent cell damage. Gametes spread onto pretreated slides are dehydrated and directly observed under phase contrast microscopy or stained with specific fluorochromes for DNA or proteins. Results show that the morphology of whole sperm is highly preserved allowing identification of sperm characteristics difficult to visualize after using standard fixation procedures. In Drosophila melanogaster, SIM allows the simultaneous visualization of the complete flagellum plus a clear delineation of the DNA. It also allows observation of morphological changes in the perforatorium as sperm elongation takes place. In E. virens, SIM slides visualized under phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy show three main morphological regions on the entire spermatozoa. Spermatozoa of this species are auto-fluorescent under wavelength excitation from 387 to 562 nm.

Activity of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) affects sucrose responsiveness and habituation in Drosophila melanogaster,15169860,10.1101/lm.71604,"The cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) has many cellular functions in vertebrates and insects that affect complex behaviors such as locomotion and foraging. The foraging (for) gene encodes a PKG in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we demonstrate a function for the for gene in sensory responsiveness and nonassociative learning. Larvae of the natural variant sitter (for(s)) show less locomotor activity during feeding and have a lower PKG activity than rover (for(R)) larvae. We used rover and sitter adult flies to test whether PKG activity affects (1) responsiveness to sucrose stimuli applied to the front tarsi, and (2) habituation of proboscis extension after repeated sucrose stimulation. To determine whether the differences observed resulted from variation in the for gene, we also tested for(s2), a sitter mutant produced on a rover genetic background. We found that rovers (for(R)) were more responsive to sucrose than sitters (for(s) and for(s2)) at 1-, 2-, and 3-wk old. This was true for both sexes. Differences in sucrose responsiveness between rovers and sitters were greater after 2 h of food deprivation than after 24 h. Of flies with similar sucrose responsiveness, for(R) rovers showed less habituation and generalization of habituation than for(s) and for(s2) sitters.

Ecdysteroids regulate yolk protein uptake by Drosophila melanogaster oocytes,12769946,10.1016/s0022-1910(98)00020-1,"Juvenile hormones (JHs) are thought to drive the regulation of yolk protein uptake by ovaries in Drosophila melanogaster. However, the level of JH production in a mutant stock (ap(56f)) is depressed yet the flies are normally vitellogenic. The production of ecdysteroids by these ap(56f) ovaries in vitro is elevated above that of wild-type ovaries. The incubation of wild-type ovaries in the presence of 0.1mM JHB(3) increased ecdysteroid biosynthesis only during the first 18h following eclosion. Female Drosophila melanogaster undergo a pre-vitellogenic reproductive diapause when exposed to low temperature (11 degrees C) and a short-day photoperiod (L12:D12). The rate of ecdysteroid synthesis by the ovaries, but not JH production, increased within 12h of a temperature upshift to 25 degrees C from a basal level of 20+/-1pg/10 pair of ovaries/5h to a sustained level of 150+/-20pg/10 pair/5h. Vitellogenic oocytes were noted in all females within 12h of this temperature upshift. Diapause was also terminated by the injection of 1&mgr;g of 20-hydroxyecdysone into the abdomens of diapausing females as determined by an increase in ovary size, and the appearance of vitellogenic oocytes as compared to controls. These results are consistent with a revised model for the regulation of yolk protein uptake by ovaries in which ecdysteroids, and not JHs, play the prominent role.",1998,"L I. Gilbert, R B.

EVOLUTION OF STARVATION RESISTANCE IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER: ASPECTS OF METABOLISM AND COUNTER-IMPACT SELECTION,28565325,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1998.tb02247.x,"An artificial selection experiment for increased female starvation resistance employed five selected lines and five control lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Females responded to selection within the first five generations, but a substantial male response was not observed until starvation resistance was assessed at generation 15. By measuring respiration rate in selected and control lines, it was possible to test the hypothesis that reduced metabolic rate is a general mechanism for stress resistance. There was no association between starvation resistance and respiration rate and thus no support for the hypothesis. Studies using vertebrates have shown that starvation causes a decrease in intermediary metabolism enzyme activity, but this relationship is not well documented in invertebrates. In the present study, intermediary metabolism enzyme activities decreased in response to starvation in control-line females and males, and in selected-line males. However, the selected females showed no overall decrease in enzyme activities in response to starvation. One interpretation is that selected females evolved to resist the phenotypic impact of stress.

The changes in power requirements and muscle efficiency during elevated force production in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,9131808,,"The limits of flight performance have been estimated in tethered Drosophila melanogaster by modulating power requirements in a 'virtual reality' flight arena. At peak capacity, the flight muscles can sustain a mechanical power output of nearly 80 W kg-1 muscle mass at 24 degrees C, which is sufficient to generate forces of approximately 150% of the animal's weight. The increase in flight force above that required to support body weight is accompanied by a rise in wing velocity, brought about by an increase in stroke amplitude and a decrease in stroke frequency. Inertial costs, although greater than either profile or induced power, would be minimal with even modest amounts of elastic storage, and total mechanical power energy should be equivalent to aerodynamic power alone. Because of the large profile drag expected at low Reynolds numbers, the profile power was approximately twice the induced power at all levels of force generation. Thus, it is the cost of overcoming drag, and not the production of lift, that is the primary requirement for flight in Drosophila melanogaster. By comparing the estimated mechanical power output with respirometrically measured total power input, we determined that muscle efficiency rises with increasing force production to a maximum of 10%. This change in efficiency may reflect either increased crossbridge activation or a favorable strain regime during the production of peak forces.",1997,"F O Lehmann, M H Dickinson, F O Lehmann, M H Dickinson"
A transposon as a cytogenetic marker in Drosophila melanogaster,6090867,10.1007/BF00334085,"We have analyzed the behavior of a transposing element (TE) in Drosophila melanogaster. The TE carries the structural genes white (wa or waR = white apricot reversed) and roughest (rst+), which corresponds to the bands 3C2-6 and a genetic distance of approximately 0.7 map units. Due to the large size, TE can often be visualized in the polytene chromosomes as extra bands at the site of the transposon. We have identified over 100 different transpositions, most of which are situated in the large autosomes; genetic and cytological information is presented for 41 of these positions. Excision of TE may occur once in 1,000 chromosomes, while insertion in a new position is more rare, about once in 10,000 animals or less. The structure of TE itself is variable: regions within it may be lost, genes located adjacent to the site of insertion may transpose with the TE (""hitch-hiking"" genes) or the TE may be duplicated. Possible mechanisms for transposition of the TE and its relation to ""dispersed gene families"" are discussed. Paro et al. (1983) have studied the end segments of the TE and isolated so-called FB elements (FB-NOF), which are responsible for its ability to transpose.

The requirement of 35-kDa CBP for mRNA translation in Drosophila was diminished under ionic conditions in which the importance of mRNA cap structure recognition was reduced.

Apple phlorizin attenuates oxidative stress in Drosophila melanogaster,31353567,10.1111/jfbc.12744,"Apple phlorizin has a lot of applications owing to its antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties. This study explored the antioxidant effects and life span-prolonging activity of apple phlorizin in Drosophila melanogaster. Treatment with apple phlorizin was found to significantly extend the life span and ameliorate the age-related decline of locomotor function. This life span-extending activity was associated with the increased activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, mRNA expression of glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit, cap-n-collar (cnc, homologue of mammalian Nrf2 gene), Keap1, and deacetylase sir2, as well as the downregulation of methuselah. Computational analysis suggested phlorizin could work as a Nrf2 activator and exert its biological activities by interfering with the Keap1 and Nrf2 binding. Therefore, it was concluded that the antioxidant and anti-aging effects of phlorizin might, at least in part, be mediated through the cooperation with the endogenous stress defense system. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Phlorizin, from apple peel, has been used as a nutrient for over 100 years. To date, despite extensive research on phlorizin, a report on its effect on the antioxidant system in fruit flies is yet lacking.

We gather RNA-seq data from 71 genetically distinct F1 Drosophila melanogaster embryos and calculate the correlations between TF and potential target genes' expression levels, which we call ""regulatory strength."" To separate direct and indirect TF targets, we hypothesize that direct TF targets will have a preponderance of binding sites in their upstream regions. Using 14 TFs active during embryogenesis, we find that 12 TFs showed a significant correlation between their binding strength and regulatory strength on downstream targets, and 10 TFs showed a significant correlation between the number of binding sites and the regulatory effect on target genes. The general roles, e.g. bicoid's role as an activator, and the particular interactions we observed between our TFs, e.g. twist's role as a repressor of sloppy paired and odd paired, generally coincide with the literature.",2018,"Noha M Osman, Tevfik Hamdi Kitapci, Srna Vlaho, Zeba Wunderlich, Sergey V Nuzhdin, Noha M Osman, Tevfik Hamdi Kitapci, Srna Vlaho, Zeba Wunderlich, Sergey V Nuzhdin"
Genetic trade-offs between male reproductive traits in Drosophila melanogaster,30333262,10.1098/rsbl.2018.0474,"In Drosophila melanogaster, males engage in both extensive pre- and post-copulatory competition for the opportunity to mate with females and subsequently sire offspring. The selection pressure for increased male reproductive success has resulted in the evolution of a wide diversity of sexual traits. However, despite strong selection, individuals often exhibit considerable phenotypic variation in the expression of these traits, and it is unclear if any of this variation is owing to underlying genetic trade-offs. Here, using hemiclonal flies, we examine how male reproductive success covaries with their ability to induce long-term stimulation of oogenesis and oviposition in their mates, and how this relationship may change over time. We found that males from hemiclone lines with phenotypes that were more successful in a short-term reproductive 'scramble' environment were less effective at stimulating long-term fecundity in females. Furthermore, we observed that males from hemiclone lines which showed the most improvement over a longer reproductive interaction period also tended to stimulate higher long-term fecundity in females. Together, these results indicate the presence of genetic trade-offs between different male reproductive traits and offer insights into the maintenance of their variation.",2018,"David C S Filice, Tristan A F Long, David C S Filice, Tristan A F Long"
Exploration of teratogenic and genotoxic effects of fruit ripening retardant Alar (Daminozide) on model organism Drosophila melanogaster,30181710,10.2478/intox-2018-0004,"Alar (Daminozide) is a plant growth regulator which is widely used as a fruit preservative for apple and mango to prevent pre-harvest fruit drop, promote color development and to delay excessive ripening. The aim of the present work was to demonstrate the effect of Alar on several life history traits, adult morphology, Hsp70 protein expression and in vivo DNA damage in the brain of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. We assessed the life history and morphological traits including fecundity, developmental time, pupation height, egg-to-adult viability and mean wing length, body length, arista length and sternopleural bristle number of the emerging flies. The results showed a significant delay in the developmental milestones, increase in body length, wing length, arista length, a decrease in fecundity, pupal height and variation in sternopleural bristle number in the treated flies in comparison to the controls.

Oligomerization and chaperone-like activity of Drosophila melanogaster small heat shock protein DmHsp27 and three arginine mutants in the alpha-crystallin domain,27933579,10.1007/s12192-016-0748-7,"The small Hsp DmHsp27 from Drosophila melanogaster is one of the few small heat shock proteins (sHsps) found within the nucleus. We report that its dimerization is independent of disulfide bond formation and seems to rely on salt bridges. Unlike metazoan sHsps, DmHsp27 forms two populations of oligomers not in equilibrium. Mutations at highly conserved arginine residues in mammalian sHsps have been reported to be associated with protein conformational defects and intracellular aggregation. Independent mutation of three highly conserved arginines (R122, R131, and R135) to glycine in DmHsp27 results in only one population of higher molecular weight form. In vitro, the chaperone-like activity of wild-type DmHsp27 was comparable with that of its two isolated populations and to the single population of the R122G, R131G, and R135G using luciferase as substrate. However, using insulin, the chaperone-like activity of wild-type DmHsp27 was lower than that of R122G and R131G mutants.

Modulating effect of losartan potassium on the mutagenicity and recombinogenicity of doxorubicin in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,27394655,10.1016/j.fct.2016.07.003,"Losartan potassium is an antihypertensive drug in the angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARA) class. Some studies claim that, in addition to regulating blood pressure, this class of drug has anticancer properties. The objective of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic and antigenotoxic potential of losartan potassium using the SMART (Somatic Mutation and Recombination Test) assay on the somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster, as well as the possible modulating effects of this drug, when associated with doxorubicin (DXR). Third instar larvae, descendents of standard and high bioactivation (ST and HB) crosses, were chronically treated with different concentrations of losartan potassium (0.25; 0.5; 1; 2; and 4 mM) alone or in association (co-treatment) with doxorubicin (DXR 0.125 mg/mL). The results showed an absence of a mutagenic effect of losartan potassium. In the co-treatment of losartan with DXR, the results showed that losartan is capable of reducing the number of mutant spots induced by DXR without altering the recombinogenic effect of the chemotherapeutic agent. Antiproliferative action appears to be the main mechanism involved in reducing the frequency of mutant spots and consequent modulation of alterations induced by DXR, although this parameter has not been directly assessed in this study.",2016,"R G Silva-Oliveira, P C Orsolin, J C Nepomuceno, R G Silva-Oliveira, P C Orsolin, J C Nepomuceno"

Mutational elimination of gene function has been widely used in the fly Drosophila melanogaster. RNA interference is used extensively as well. In the fly, exceptionally precise temporal and spatial control over elimination of gene function can be achieved in combination with sophisticated transgenic approaches and clonal analyses. However, the methods that act at the gene and transcript level cannot eliminate protein products which are already present at the time when mutant cells are generated or RNA interference is started. Targeted inducible protein degradation is therefore of considerable interest for controlled rapid elimination of gene function. To this end, a degradation system was developed in yeast exploiting TIR1, a plant F box protein, which can recruit proteins with an auxin-inducible degron to an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, but only in the presence of the phytohormone auxin. Here we demonstrate that the auxin-inducible degradation system functions efficiently also in Drosophila melanogaster.

Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the adult Drosophila melanogaster proteome,24259522,10.1002/pmic.201300121,"Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most widely used model organisms in life sciences. Mapping its proteome is of great significance for understanding the biological characteristics and tissue functions of this species. However, the comprehensive coverage of its proteome remains a challenge. Here, we describe a high-coverage analysis of whole fly through a 1D gel electrophoresis and LC-MS/MS approach. By combining the datasets of two types of SDS-PAGE and two kinds of tagmata, the high-coverage analysis resulted in the identification of 5262 genes, which correspond to 38.23% of the entire coding genes. Moreover, we found that the fly head and body have different molecular weight distributions of their proteomes when the proteins were resolved with SDS-PAGE and image analysis of the stained gel. This phenomenon was further confirmed by both label-free and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation-based quantitative approaches.

Thus, dihydropyridines, a class of calcium channel blockers, and resveratrol, a polyphenol that presents antioxidant properties, may represent therapeutic alternatives for the prevention of PD.

"Identification and analysis of YELLOW protein family genes in the silkworm, Bombyx mori",16884544,10.1186/1471-2164-7-195,"Background:
      
    

    
      The major royal jelly proteins/yellow (MRJP/YELLOW) family possesses several physiological and chemical functions in the development of Apis mellifera and Drosophila melanogaster. Each protein of the family has a conserved domain named MRJP. However, there is no report of MRJP/YELLOW family proteins in the Lepidoptera.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Using the YELLOW protein sequence in Drosophila melanogaster to BLAST silkworm EST database, we found a gene family composed of seven members with a conserved MRJP domain each and named it YELLOW protein family of Bombyx mori. We completed the cDNA sequences with RACE method. The protein of each member possesses a MRJP domain and a putative cleavable signal peptide consisting of a hydrophobic sequence. In view of genetic evolution, the whole Bm YELLOW protein family composes a monophyletic group, which is distinctly separate from Drosophila melanogaster and Apis mellifera. We then showed the tissue expression profiles of Bm YELLOW protein family genes by RT-PCR.

      A Bombyx mori YELLOW protein family is found to be composed of at least seven members.

Natural repressors of P-induced hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster: a model for repressor evolution,8801184,10.1017/s0016672300033577,"Type I repressors control P element transposition and comprise full length elements and elements with small 3' deletions in the final exon. Using a sensitive assay for measuring the strength of repression of P element transposition in somatic and germline tissues, we have isolated and characterized a naturally occurring type I repressor element from a Q population of Drosophila melanogaster. We demonstrate that the almost complete repression of transposition in this population is a mixture of KP elements with intermediate levels of repression, and the strong contribution of a single 2.6 kb P element deletion derivative, which we call SR (Strong Repressor). A deletion in the final intron of SR allows for the constitutive production of a putative 75 kDa repressor protein in germline tissues in addition to the production of the 66 kDa repressor in the soma, which would result in a biparental mode of inheritance of repression. Based on the four observed classes of natural Q populations, we propose a model in which populations containing SR-like elements, capable of producing strong type I repressor constitutively, have a selective advantage over populations which rely either on maternally transmitted P cytotype or on KP-induced weak levels of repression. Such populations may subsequently spread and constitute an evolutionary stable strategy for the repression of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster.",1996,"P Corish, D M Black, D W Featherston, J Merriam, G A Dover, P Corish, D M Black, D W Featherston, J Merriam, G A Dover"

Since fixed material was used, our conclusions are based upon the statistical evaluation of a large number of accurately staged embryos, covering the stages between the formation of the cephalic furrow up to shortened germ band. Our observations point to a rather stereotypic pattern of proliferation, consisting of several parasynchronous cycles of division. The data suggest that all SI neuroblasts divide at least eight times, all SII neuroblasts six or seven times and all SIII neuroblasts at least five times. This conclusion is based on the mapping of mitotic neuroblasts and is supported by the progressive reduction of the neuroblast volume and by the results of cell countings performed on embryos of increasing age. No conclusive evidence was obtained concerning the fate of the neuroblasts after their last mitosis, i.e. it cannot be decided whether the neuroblasts degenerate or become incorporated as inconspicuous cells in the larval ventral cord. The duration of the cycles of division of the neuroblasts was found to be 40-50 min each, while in the case of ganglion mother cells about 100 min are required to complete one cell cycle.",1987,"Volker Hartenstein, Eberhard Rudloff, Jose A Campos-Ortega, Volker Hartenstein, Eberhard Rudloff, Jose A Campos-Ortega"

In general, responses to laboratory selection for these traits in D. melanogaster are rapid and indicate abundant genetic variation in populations. However, slower responses to selection for desiccation resistance occur in other species including D. simulans. Clines suggest adaptive divergence although specific selection pressures have not been documented empirically. Drosophila species differ markedly in desiccation and starvation resistance and there is also marked variation within species for desiccation resistance that may be linked to local climatic conditions. Laboratory selection experiments on starvation resistance in D. melanogaster suggest that changes in lipid content are largely responsible for resistance variation but this factor may be less important in explaining variation among species. For desiccation, lines with increased resistance show reduced rates of water loss but no changes in the minimum water content that flies can tolerate. Changes in life history traits are sometimes associated with altered levels of stress resistance. Increased starvation resistance is associated with longer development time and reduced early age reproduction in different studies. However, other associations are inconsistent between studies as in the case of stress resistance changing following selection for longevity. Multiple mechanisms may underlie genetic variation in stress resistance and future studies should address the evolutionary importance of the different mechanisms at the population and species levels.",1999,"A A Hoffmann, L G Harshman, A A Hoffmann, L G Harshman"

Thorax inoculation results in increased bacterial proliferation and causes high mortality within the first few days of infection. In contrast, abdomen inoculation results in minimal mortality and lower bacterial loads than thorax inoculation. Inoculation into either site causes systemic infection. Differences in mortality and bacterial load are due to injury of the thorax and can be recapitulated by abdominal inoculation coupled with aseptic wounding of the thorax.

We experimentally manipulated the number of female matings by varying the order of daily 2-h exposures of females to either sperm-less males (XO) or intact males (XY). Females that mated more often had substantially reduced lifetime fecundity, and importantly, the fitness cost from remating rapidly accelerated.",2006,"B Kuijper, A D Stewart, W R Rice, B Kuijper, A D Stewart, W R Rice"

Phenotypic association of spontaneous ovulation and sexual receptivity in virgin females of Drosophila melanogaster mutants,11777172,10.1023/a:1012794421980,"In Drosophila melanogaster females, mating stimulates ovulation/oviposition and switches off receptivity. To investigate the relationship between ovulation and receptivity, we searched for genetic variants in which ovulation occurs in virgins and characterized their behavioral phenotype. Among a collection of 333 P-element insertion lines, we identified eight lines that showed elevated ovulation in virgins. These females show ovipositor extrusion toward courting males, which is normally observed in mated females. To express the amount of rejection behavior, we defined the extrusion index (EI) as a percentage of time that each female extruded the ovipositor within the total time of being courted. There was a positive correlation between ovulation level and EI, suggesting that the two traits are physiologically associated. Genetic analysis of the variants revealed two regions on the third chromosome responsible for the phenotype.",2001,"A Ejima, S Nakayama, T Aigaki, A Ejima, S Nakayama, T Aigaki"

Stress resistance and longevity in selected lines of Drosophila melanogaster,10638525,10.1016/s0197-4580(99)00091-3,"Five independent populations (lines) of Drosophila melanogaster were selected for female starvation resistance.

Moreover, flies from selected lines were resistant to other stresses: desiccation, acetone fumes, ethanol fumes, and paraquat (a source of oxygen radicals). Data from a variety of previous studies indicate an association between stress resistance and longevity. In this context, the present study addressed the question of whether flies from the stress-resistant lines were relatively long-lived. Replicate population cages from each selected and control line were used to assess longevity. Neither females nor males from the selected lines were relatively long-lived.

The types and distributions of these variants are consistent with the hypothesis that they have arisen by a random accumulation of point mutations (substitutions, deletions, and insertions) in pure (GATA)n sequences. Duplications or deletions of the GATA subunit, and of GATA variants, have also probably occurred, as a result of either unequal crossing-over or slipped-strand mispairing.

Regulation of behavioral and pheromonal aspects of sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster by the Sex-lethal gene,2513254,,"We have shown that the Sex-lethal (Sxl) gene, which controls morphological aspects of sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster, also regulates sexual behavior. Chromosomal males that are hemizygous for a deletion of the entire Sxl locus perform normal courtship and synthesize the two courtship-inhibiting pheromones that normal males make. However, ectopic expression of female-specific Sex-lethal gene products drastically alters chromosomal males' ability to perform and elicit courtship and increases the probability that they will synthesize a courtship-stimulating pheromone or fail to synthesize one of the inhibitory pheromones. These observations suggest that male sexual behavior is a consequence of the Sxl gene's being functionally inactive in haplo-X flies.",1989,"L Tompkins, S P McRobert, L Tompkins, S P McRobert"

Males from these stocks showed the same incidence of territorial encounters. However, Melbourne males were more successful at obtaining territories in competition with Townsville or Corindi males. This difference could be accounted for largely by variation in body weight, although territorial success was also determined by other factors because Townsville and Corindi males that held territories were not heavier than Melbourne males. In reciprocal crosses between the populations there was directional dominance for increased territorial success. F1 males were of intermediate weight and F1 males that held territories tended to be lighter than territorial Melbourne males.

We have studied the effects of different patterns of mating (free mating, enforced random mating and enforced assortative mating) in a population of Drosophila melanogaster subjected to disruptive selection on body weight. Disruptive selection increased the weight dispersion in all mating patterns but brought about divergence within the population only when it occurred in association with enforced assortative mating (without complete sexual isolation between the subpopulations). When mating was free, the dispersion, measured by change in the coefficient of variation, was only somewhat larger than with enforced random mating: thus the principal consequence of disruptive selection was the rise of polymorphism in the population.",1986,"D Higuet, D Higuet"

Octaribonucleotides, the major component (ca. 30%), formed the cap structure in the reaction with vaccinia guanylyltransferase and [alpha-32P]GTP, indicating that they were the intact primer RNA with tri- (or di-) phosphate termini, and the shorter ribooligomers were degradation intermediates. The intact primers started with purine (A/G ratio, 4:1), and the starting few ribonucleotide residues were rich in A.",1984,"T Kitani, K Yoda, T Okazaki, T Kitani, K Yoda, T Okazaki"
Nonselective amplification of ribosomal DNA repeat units in compensating genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster,6431964,10.1007/BF00484516,"Compensation is a mechanism by which the X-chromosome nucleolus organizer region of Drosophila melanogaster can increase its ribosomal DNA content up to twofold. It occurs in somatic cells under specific genetic conditions and is mediated by a defined genetic site, the compensatory response locus. The In- and various type I ribosomal DNA repeat units were separated by restriction endonuclease digestion. Comparison of the percentages of these repeat unit types between compensating and noncompensating genotypes showed the same distribution. Therefore no selective amplification of these repeat unit types occurs during ribosomal DNA compensation. These results demonstrate that two processes of rDNA amplification in somatic cells, compensation and independent rDNA polytenization, are exclusive events.",1984,"K E Kalumuck, J D Procunier, K E Kalumuck, J D Procunier"
Genetic architecture of olfactory discriminative avoidance conditioning in Drosophila melanogaster,6409500,,"Recent claims to have demonstrated associative learning ability in Drosophila melanogaster raise questions about the adaptive significance of behavioral modifiability of this species. In a strain survey and a 9 X 9 half diallel cross study of olfactory discriminative avoidance conditioning, a low narrow heritability and strong directional dominance or heterosis controlling nonrandom phenotypic variation were found. Furthermore, the predicted inbreeding depression and asymmetrical response to bidirectional genetic selection were both observed. The genetic architecture revealed in these experiments is consistent with a close association between this conditioning phenotype and evolutionary fitness. Predictions from this interpretation to the nature of new mutations have been confirmed, and a possible role for conditioning in courtship behavior has been identified.",1983,"J K Hewitt, D W Fulker, C A Hewitt, J K Hewitt, D W Fulker, C A Hewitt"
The entire compound autosomes of Drosophila melanogaster,6799353,,"Three new unusual compound chromosomes have been synthesized in Drosophila melanogaster.

The attachments of the autosomal arms were accomplished by obtaining chromosome breaks at or very close to the ends of the left arms of the autosomes such that no essential chromosome material has been removed; the compounds derived from them are therefore referred to as entire compounds. These large chromosomes are recovered in progeny with frequencies lower than expectation partly because of zygote mortality associated with these chromosomes, and partly because of a failure of spermiogenesis.",1981,"E Novitski, D Grace, C Strommen, E Novitski, D Grace, C Strommen"

Quantitative analysis of the secretory protein 1, showed that, when present in extra dose, region 25 B results in a significant elevation in its relative amount.

Correlations between chromosome segments and fitness in Drosophila melanogaster. I. The X chromosome and egg production,405278,,"Unmarked segments within the X chromosomes of four different Drosophila melanogaster isogenic lines were assessed with respect to egg production. By making a series of crosses among original and derived recombinant lines, it was possible to estimate parameters representing additive, dominance and interaction effects of the segments. It was shown that whereas most of the segments were additive for egg production when homozygous, they all displayed dominance in the heterozygous condition. Two of the strains were characterized by intersegmental interaction. A possible position effect was detected for these same two strains, with flies in the coupling phase laying more eggs than those in the repulsion configuration.

"Comparative modeling of the phosphatase and kinase domains of protein tyrosine phosphatase and insulin receptor kinase from Drosophila melanogaster (DPTP61fm), and a computational study of their mutual interactions",11989718,10.1139/o02-001,"The components and functions of the insulin receptor kinase signaling pathway have been conserved in a broad range of Metazoa ranging from mammals to insects and nematodes. There is a high degree of sequence homology and functional similarity between the human insulin receptor kinase (IRK) and the drosophila (Drosophila melanogaster) form (DIRK) of this enzyme. Similarly, a high degree of homology exists between human protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) (which directly regulates IRK) and its drosophila counterpart DPTP61F (DPTP). However, genetic and biochemical studies have yet to demonstrate that DPTP61F acts in the DIRK pathway. Comparative structural modeling techniques using the known structures of human IRK and PTP1B as templates have yielded structures for the drosophila enzymes. The derived structures confirm that there is a high level of structural conservation at the tertiary level. Association of the DIRK and DPTP enzymes with each other was then investigated with a view to ascertaining whether DIRK might be a substrate of the DPTP. Evaluation of the interaction surfaces, including hydrophobic patch, shape, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic compatibility, strongly suggested that the drosophila insulin receptor is a substrate of the DPTP. The interaction surfaces of the human and drosophila enzymes are structurally similar, although changes in critical residues modify possible electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. This suggests that in the mixed systems, DPTP-IRK or PTP1B-DIRK, the kinase domain will be a comparatively poor substrate for phosphatase activity when compared with the native systems.",2002,"Sanchita Hati, Sudeep Bhattacharyya, James V Price, Alan S Tracey, Sanchita Hati, Sudeep Bhattacharyya, James V Price, Alan S Tracey"

However, coumarin feeding could be inhibited through activation of the aversive gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), but not the olfactory receptor neurons. Furthermore, three gustatory receptors, GR33a, GR66a, and GR93a, functioned together in coumarin detection by the proboscis. However, GR33a, but not GR66a and GR93a, was required to avoid coumarin during oviposition, with a choice of the same substrates provided as in binary food choice assay.

SuUR overexpression from heat shock-driven transgene results in the formation of partial chromosomal aberrations whose breakpoints map exclusively to the regions of intercalary and pericentric heterochromatin. It is important to note that all these effects are seen only if SuUR overexpression is induced during early stages of chromosome polytenization. Therefore, we developed the idea that ectopic pairing results from the joining of free DNA ends, which are formed as a consequence of underreplication.",2006,"Elena S Belyaeva, Sergey A Demakov, Galina V Pokholkova, Artyom A Alekseyenko, Tatiana D Kolesnikova, Igor F Zhimulev, Elena S Belyaeva, Sergey A Demakov, Galina V Pokholkova, Artyom A Alekseyenko, Tatiana D Kolesnikova, Igor F Zhimulev"
Two distinct domains in Drosophila melanogaster telomeres,16143601,10.1534/genetics.105.048827,"Telomeres are generally considered heterochromatic. On the basis of DNA composition, the telomeric region of Drosophila melanogaster contains two distinct subdomains: a subtelomeric region of repetitive DNA, termed TAS, and a terminal array of retrotransposons, which perform the elongation function instead of telomerase. We have identified several P-element insertions into this retrotransposon array and compared expression levels of transgenes with similar integrations into TAS and euchromatic regions. In contrast to insertions in TAS, which are silenced, reporter genes in the terminal HeT-A, TAHRE, or TART retroelements did not exhibit repressed expression in comparison with the same transgene construct in euchromatin. These data, in combination with cytological studies, provide evidence that the subtelomeric TAS region exhibits features resembling heterochromatin, while the terminal retrotransposon array exhibits euchromatic characteristics.",2005,"Harald Biessmann, Sudha Prasad, Valery F Semeshin, Eugenia N Andreyeva, Quang Nguyen, Marika F Walter, James M Mason, Harald Biessmann, Sudha Prasad, Valery F Semeshin, Eugenia N Andreyeva, Quang Nguyen, Marika F Walter, James M Mason"

Persistence of eclosion rhythm in Drosophila melanogaster after 600 generations in an aperiodic environment,10501695,10.1007/s001140050651,"The ubiquity of circadian rhythms suggests that they have an intrinsic adaptive value (Ouyang et al. 1998; Ronneberg and Foster 1997). Some experiments have shown that organisms have enhanced longevity, development time or growth rates when maintained in environments whose periodicity closely matches their endogenous period (Aschoff et al. 1971; Highkin and Hanson 1954; Hillman 1956; Pittendrigh and Minis 1972; Went 1960). So far there has been no experimental evidence to show that circadian rhythms per se (i.e. periodicity itself, as opposed to phasing properties of a rhythm) confer a fitness advantage. We show that the circadian eclosion rhythm persists in a population of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster maintained in constant conditions of light, temperature, and humidity for over 600 generations. The results suggest that even in the absence of any environmental cycle there exists some intrinsic fitness value of circadian rhythms.",1999,"V Sheeba, V K Sharma, M K Chandrashekaran, A Joshi, V Sheeba, V K Sharma, M K Chandrashekaran, A Joshi"
Are unpaired chromosomes spermicidal?: A maximum-likelihood analysis of segregation and meiotic drive in Drosophila melanogaster males deficient for the ribosomal-dna,9872964,,"Meiosis in Drosophila melanogaster males is achiasmate and requires special systems to ensure normal segregation. Several situations that yield frequent nondisjunction also produce high levels of chromatin-dependent sperm lethality, suggesting the possibility of a simple and direct connection between defective disjunction and defective sperm development. One hypothesis that has been offered is that pairing not only ensures disjunction, but also changes the physical state of chromosomes so that they can be packaged in sperm. Here, I present an analysis of extensive data on disjunction and sperm survival in rDNA-deficient males collected by B. McKee and D. Lindsley. This analysis demonstrates that, although nondisjunction and sperm lethality are indeed correlated, the basis of this is not the presence of unpaired chromosomes in the sperm. Chromosomes that have failed to disjoin are not themselves spermicidal.",1999,"L G Robbins, L G Robbins"

This fact explicitly indicated that tumour formation has a deleterious effect on the survival rate and thus the life span of its carriers.

Linkage and segregation distortion in Drosophila melanogaster,2515987,10.1139/g89-520,Segregation distortion is caused by a group of genetic elements in and near the centric heterochromatin of chromosome 2 of Drosophila melanogaster. These elements promote their preferential recovery in heterozygous males by rendering sperm bearing the homologous chromosome dysfunctional. Previous work has shown that numerous Y-autosome translocations are associated with the suppression of the segregation distorter phenotype. The present study examined the effects of translocations between the major autosomes upon the expression of segregation distortion. Autosomal translocations involving either the segregation distorter chromosome or its sensitive homologue had no significant effect upon the expression of segregation distortion. These results argue that linkage arrangement per se may not have a major effect on segregation distortion.

Cloning of a Drosophila melanogaster adenine phosphoribosyltransferase structural gene and deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme,3125085,10.1016/0378-1119(87)90268-x,"The Aprt locus of Drosophila melanogaster encodes the structural gene for adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT).

Aprt lies at cytogenetic position 62B9 and is closely flanked by other genes of unknown function. Nucleotide sequencing shows that four APRT cDNAs have a common 5' terminus with an apparent cap consensus sequence but two different 3' sites of polyadenylation.

Genetic-molecular basis for a simple Drosophila melanogaster somatic system that detects environmental mutagens,3092217,10.1073/pnas.83.18.6667,"We have developed a simple, objectively scorable test for the mutagenicity of chemical compounds which can be fed Drosophila melanogaster. The test depends upon the somatic reversion of the X chromosome, recessive eye color mutation, white-ivory (wi) to wild type (w+). Reversions are scored as clones of w+ facets in the wi eyes of eclosing adults. To increase the sensitivity, a tandem quadruplication containing four wi mutations was synthesized. Thus, in homozygous females eight wi mutations are potentially revertible. Six mutagenic compounds, all alkylating agents, all gave positive results at several concentrations tested. Molecular analysis demonstrates that the induced reversions, germinal and somatic, are associated with the loss of 2.9-kilobase DNA duplicated in the wi mutation.",1986,"M M Green, T Todo, H Ryo, K Fujikawa, M M Green, T Todo, H Ryo, K Fujikawa"

Regulation of amylase activity in drosophila melanogaster: effects of dietary carbohydrate,6187335,10.1007/BF00498936,"The level of amylase activity in larvae and adults of Drosophila melanogaster is dependent on the dietary carbohydrate source; flies or larvae from a food medium containing starch show higher levels of activity than individuals from a food containing simple sugars. This is shown to be due to repression of activity by sugars rather than enhancement of activity by starch. Moreover, the changes in enzyme activity reflect a change in enzyme quantity rather than a change in catalytic efficiency. The seeming stimulation of amylase activity by sucrose in some experiments is due, simply, to comparisons with ""starvation"" diets which cause a large nonspecific reduction in enzyme activity. Though all strains tested showed repression of enzyme activity by simple sugars, the degree of repression varies between strains. Also, in those strains which carry a duplication of the amylase structural gene, the two isozymal forms of amylase can be differentially repressed by dietary sugars.",1982,"D A Hickey, B Benkel, D A Hickey, B Benkel"

After metamorphosis, the explants were examined to determine the effect of their respective hosts. There were no differences in the extent of variegation between eyes transplanted into hosts carrying different amounts of extra-heterochromatin.

Based on LD50 values by topical application, the Puerto Rico strain was 73-fold resistant to permethrin compared with a susceptible Orlando strain. In the presence of piperonyl butoxide, the resistance of Puerto Rico strain of Ae. aegypti was reduced to 15-fold, suggesting that cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification is involved in the resistance of the Puerto Rico strain to permethrin. To determine the cytochrome P450s that might play a role in the resistance to permethrin, the transcriptional levels of 164 cytochrome P450 genes in the Puerto Rico strain were compared with that in the Orlando strain. Of the 164 cytochrome P450s, 33 were significantly (P < 0.05) up-regulated, including cytochrome P450s in families four, six, and nine. Multiple studies have investigated the functionality of family six and nine cytochrome P450s, therefore, we focused on the up-regulated family 4 cytochrome P450s. To determine whether up-regulation of the four cytochrome P450s had any functional role in permethrin resistance, transgenic Drosophila melanogaster Meigen lines overexpressing the four family 4 P450 genes were generated, and their ability to survive exposure to permethrin was evaluated.

The cytochrome b region in the mitochondrial DNA of the ant Tetraponera rufoniger: sequence divergence in Hymenoptera may be associated with nucleotide content,8006995,10.1007/BF00176090,"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequencing of single-stranded DNA yielded sequence information from the cytochrome b (cyt b) region in mitochondrial DNA from the ant Tetraponera rufoniger. Compared with the cyt b genes from Apis mellifera, Drosophila melanogaster, and D. yakuba, the overall A+T content (A+T%) of that of T. rufoniger is lower (69.9% vs 80.7%, 74.2%, and 73.9%, respectively) than those of the other three. The codon usage in the cyt b gene of T. rufoniger is biased although not as much as in A. mellifera, D. melanogaster, and D. yakuba; T. rufoniger has eight unused codons whereas D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, and A. mellifera have 21, 20, and 23, respectively. The inferred cyt b polypeptide chain (PPC) of T. rufoniger has diverged at least as much from a common ancestor with D. yakuba as has that of A. mellifera (approximately 3.5 vs approximately 2.9). Despite the lower A+T%, the relative frequencies of amino acids in the cyt b PPC of T. rufoniger are significantly (P < 0.05) associated with the content of adenine and thymine (A+T%) and size of codon families. The mitochondrially located cytochrome oxidase subunit II genes (CO-II) of endopterygote insects have significantly higher average A+T% (approximately 75%) than those of exopterygous (approximately 69%) and paleopterous (approximately 69%) insects. The increase in A+T% of endopterygote insects occurred in Upper Carboniferous and coincided with a significant acceleration of PPC divergence. However, acceleration of PPC divergence is not significantly correlated with the increase of the A+T% (P > 0.1). The high A+T%, the biased codon usage, and the increased PPC divergence of Hymenoptera can in that respect most easily be explained by directional mutation pressure which began in the Upper Carboniferous and still occurs in most members of the order. Given the roughly identical A+T% of the cyt b and CO-II genes from the other insects whose DNA sequences are known (A. mellifera, D. melanogaster, and D. yakuba), it seems most likely that the A+T% of T. rufoniger declined secondarily within the last 100 Myr as a result of a reduced directional mutation pressure.",1994,"L S Jermiin, R H Crozier, L S Jermiin, R H Crozier"

We show new evidence that EcR-A/USP-2 and E75A contribute to the down-regulation of MHR3 after the peak of ecdysteroid. Also, there is suggestive evidence that both MHR4 and betaFTZ-F1 may regulate the expression of dopa decarboxylase as the ecdysteroid titer declines. We summarize the regulation by JH of the Broad transcription factor that normally appears in the epidermis in the final larval instar and specifies pupal cuticle formation at the metamorphic molt. Premature expression of different Broad isoforms also is shown to cause precocious degeneration of the prothoracic glands as well as to prevent ecdysteroid release during its presence.",2003,"Lynn M Riddiford, Kiyoshi Hiruma, Xiaofeng Zhou, Charles A Nelson, Lynn M Riddiford, Kiyoshi Hiruma, Xiaofeng Zhou, Charles A Nelson"
Nucleotide variation along the Drosophila melanogaster fourth chromosome,11778050,10.1126/science.1064521,"The Drosophila melanogaster fourth chromosome, believed to be nonrecombining and invariable, is a classic example of the effect of natural selection in eliminating genetic variation in linked loci. However, in a chromosome-wide assay of nucleotide variation in natural populations, we have observed a high level of polymorphism in a approximately 200-kilobase region and marked levels of polymorphism in several other fragments interspersed with regions of little variation, suggesting different evolutionary histories in different chromosomal domains. Statistical tests of neutral evolution showed that a few haplotypes predominate in the 200-kilobase polymorphic region. Finally, contrary to the expectation of no recombination, we identified six recombination events within the chromosome. Thus, positive Darwinian selection and recombination have affected the evolution of this chromosome.",2002,"Wen Wang, Kevin Thornton, Andrew Berry, Manyuan Long, Wen Wang, Kevin Thornton, Andrew Berry, Manyuan Long"
[Stability in development and variability in morphological signs in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster: seasonal dynamics in 1999],11234427,,Seasonal dynamics of developmental stability and variability of morphological traits was examined in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster in order to compare these two parameters as indicators of temperature stress. Morphometric (thorax length and wing length) and meristic (number of sternopelural and orbital bristles) were studied. Variability was measured as the coefficient of variation. Stability of development was estimated as fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of bilateral traits. Thorax length and wing length did not exhibit consistent seasonal trends whereas wing loading significantly decreased. Significant seasonal changes in FA were not detected in any trait examined. Two traits showed reduced variation in autumn. The use of FA as an indicator of ecological stresses in insects is discussed on the basis of these results and the literature evidence.,2001,"M I Antipin, T A Rakitskaia, A G Imasheva, M I Antipin, T A Rakitskaia, A G Imasheva"
Chromatin opening of DNA satellites by targeted sequence-specific drugs,11106740,10.1016/s1097-2765(00)00099-x,"There are few tools available for dissecting and elucidating the functions of DNA satellites and other nongenic DNA. To address this, we have explored the experimental potential of DNA sequence-specific drugs containing pyrrole and imidazole amino acids (polyamides). Compounds were synthesized that target different Drosophila melanogaster satellites. Dimeric oligopyrroles were shown to target the AT-rich satellites I, III, and SARs (scaffold associated regions). One polyamide (P31) specifically binds the GAGAA satellite V. Specificity of targeting was established by footprinting, epifluorescence of nuclei, and polytene chromosomes stained with fluorescent derivatives. These polyamides were shown to mediate satellite-specific chromatin opening of the chromatin fiber. Remarkably, certain polyamides induced defined gain or loss-of-function phenotypes when fed to Drosophila melanogaster.",2000,"S Janssen, T Durussel, U K Laemmli, S Janssen, T Durussel, U K Laemmli"
A BAC-based physical map of the major autosomes of Drosophila melanogaster,10731150,10.1126/science.287.5461.2271,"We constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based physical map of chromosomes 2 and 3 of Drosophila melanogaster, which constitute 81% of the genome. Sequence tagged site (STS) content, restriction fingerprinting, and polytene chromosome in situ hybridization approaches were integrated to produce a map spanning the euchromatin. Three of five remaining gaps are in repeat-rich regions near the centromeres. A tiling path of clones spanning this map and STS maps of chromosomes X and 4 was sequenced to low coverage; the maps and tiling path sequence were used to support and verify the whole-genome sequence assembly, and tiling path BACs were used as templates in sequence finishing.",2000,"R A Hoskins, C R Nelson, B P Berman, T R Laverty, R A George, L Ciesiolka, M Naeemuddin, A D Arenson, J Durbin, R G David, P E Tabor, M R Bailey, D R DeShazo, J Catanese, A Mammoser, K Osoegawa, P J de Jong, S E Celniker, R A Gibbs, G M Rubin, S E Scherer, R A Hoskins, C R Nelson, B P Berman, T R Laverty, R A George, L Ciesiolka, M Naeemuddin, A D Arenson, J Durbin, R G David, P E Tabor, M R Bailey, D R DeShazo, J Catanese, A Mammoser, K Osoegawa, P J de Jong, S E Celniker, R A Gibbs, G M Rubin, S E Scherer"
Male seminal fluid proteins are essential for sperm storage in Drosophila melanogaster,10511561,,"The seminal fluid that is transferred along with sperm during mating acts in many ways to maximize a male's reproductive success. Here, we use transgenic Drosophila melanogaster males deficient in the seminal fluid proteins derived from the accessory gland (Acps) to investigate the role of these proteins in the fate of sperm transferred to females during mating. Competitive PCR assays were used to show that while Acps contribute to the efficiency of sperm transfer, they are not essential for the transfer of sperm to the female. In contrast, we found that Acps are essential for storage of sperm by females. Direct counts of stored sperm showed that 10% of normal levels are stored by females whose mates transfer little or no Acps along with sperm.",1999,"U Tram, M F Wolfner, U Tram, M F Wolfner"
A screen for lethal mutations in the chromosomal region 59AB suggests that bellwether encodes the alpha subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase in Drosophila melanogaster,9790593,10.1007/s004380050826,"We report the isolation and complementation mapping of lethal mutations within the 59AB region on the second chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster. The newly induced lethal mutations in this region define four different complementation groups. Using existing and newly induced deficiencies, these loci can be assigned to three different chromosomal intervals. Moreover, complementation analysis with chromosomes carrying various P element insertions, in combination with a molecular characterization of the corresponding insertion sites, suggests that the previously described male sterile mutation bellwether is an allele of an essential gene that encodes the alpha subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase.",1998,"H Jacobs, R Stratmann, C Lehner, H Jacobs, R Stratmann, C Lehner"
"[Correlation between the number of sites, transcript levels and transposition frequency of retrotransposon copia in Drosophila melanogaster]",9589871,,"Numbers of copia transcripts in testes of files from five Drosophila melanogaster lines were compared by means of Northern blot hybridization. Four of these lines were closely related differing only by transposition rates and the number of copia sites in the genome. The fifth line, which was not related to the others, was characterized by lack of transpositions and the lowest copia copy number. Positive correlation between total copia transcript level and its copy number and transposition rate was observed. Therefore, transcription rate of copia retrotransposon in tests is largely controlled by the level of its transcription, which, in turn, is regulated by the number of retrotransposon copies in the genome. These data contradict the hypothesis on self-regulation of retrotransposon copy number in the genome.",1998,"D A Filatov, E G Pasiukova, D A Filatov, E G Pasiukova"
Development and survival of Drosophila melanogaster fed a diet containing pyrimidine analogs,9418006,10.1016/s0305-0491(97)00054-0,"A single generation of Drosophila melanogaster was raised on different media. One of the media was unsupplemented (the control) and the others were supplemented with pyrimidine analog at 10.3 mmol/kg culture medium. The relative numbers of larvae, pupae, and F1 adults reproduced from parent flies on each medium served as an indication of the relative toxicity of the supplements. The relative decreasing order of toxicity of the pyrimidines was as follows: 5-bromouracil < thymine < uracil = orotic acid = control = cytosine, control < UMP. The toxic effects of 5-bromouracil and thymine seem to be associated with the addition of a bromine or methyl group to carbon 5 of the pyrimidine ring. The UMP supplementation increased the number of adult F1 flies above the control group indicating that UMP was not only non toxic but also that it was beneficial.",1997,"Y K Ho, A J Clifford, Y K Ho, A J Clifford"

[The unstable system sn(49) in Drosophila melanogaster: results of blot-hybridization and polymerase chain reaction],8755035,,"A set of 40 strains of alleles of different phenotype and mutation frequency, derived from unstable system sn49 of Drosophila melanogaster, was obtained. A mutation in the singed gene or the formation of a visible de novo mutation in the studied X chromosome served as the criterion for strain isolation. Total DNA was isolated from the obtained strains and used for blot-hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Rearrangements were found within the first intron of the singed gene. In the first intron of an allelic derivative of this unstable system, an inserted sequence of at least 4 kb in length was found. Using PCR primers from this intron, fragment length polymorphism in different derivatives was revealed.",1996,"N N Iurchenko, K O'Hare, I K Zakharov, N N Iurchenko, K O'Hare, I K Zakharov"
Genetic basis of some morphological differences between temperate and equatorial populations of Drosophila melanogaster,7628583,10.1007/BF01941273,"The genetic basis of three morphological traits (ovariole number, sternopleural bristle number and wing length) of Drosophila melanogaster has been investigated in natural populations that show great differences in these traits, i.e. Bordeaux (France) and Loua (Congo). F1 and F2 crosses, and chromosome substitutions between these two populations, were analysed. Maternal and/or X chromosome effects were found for sternopleural bristle number and wing length. For all traits, significant effects from each of the three chromosomes were found, but in general only one or two chromosomes had a major effect. Moreover, in all cases significant interactions between chromosomes were observed, suggesting the existence of epistatic effects.

The effect of an intronic polymorphism on alcohol dehydrogenase expression in Drosophila melanogaster,7828821,,"Several lines of evidence indicate that natural selection controls the frequencies of an allozyme polymorphism at the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) locus in Drosophila melanogaster. However, because of associations among sequence polymorphisms in the Adh region, it is not clear whether selection acts directly (or solely) on the allozymic site. This problem has been approached by using in vitro mutagenesis to distinguish among the effects on Adh expression of individual polymorphisms. This study shows that a polymorphism within the first Adh intron (delta 1) has a significant effect on the level of ADH protein. Like the allozyme, delta 1 shows a geographic cline in frequency, indicating that it may also be a target of natural selection. These results suggest that multisite selection models may be required to understand the evolutionary dynamics of individual loci.",1994,"C C Laurie, L F Stam, C C Laurie, L F Stam"

High rate of movement of one (mdg3) out of four transposable elements in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster,7994610,,"We have analysed by in situ hybridization the insertion site polymorphism of the copia, mdg1, mdg3, and P transposable elements in diploid genomes of wild males from a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster. The values of observed average degree of individual heterozygosity for all elements except mdg3 deviate statistically from the values expected by site frequencies, revealing a tendency toward homozygosity as if drift or a structuration in the population was operating. The high degree of heterozygosity for mdg3 which in addition does not deviate from the expected value, suggests that recent high rate of movements has strongly countered the population host effect on this element. Hence, heterozygosity for TEs may well reflect the history of the population, and reveals temporary high rate of site movement existing in natural populations.",1994,"C Biémont, F Lemeunier, C Gautier, M Garcia Guerreiro, S Aulard, E G Pasyukova, C Biémont, F Lemeunier, C Gautier, M Garcia Guerreiro, S Aulard, E G Pasyukova"
