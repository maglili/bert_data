The microbiota of Drosophila suzukii influences the larval development of Drosophila melanogaster,31763075,10.7717/peerj.8097,"Microorganisms play a central role in the biology of vinegar flies such as Drosophila suzukii and Drosophila melanogaster: serving as a food source to both adults and larvae, and influencing a range of traits including nutrition, behavior, and development. The niches utilized by the fly species partially overlap, as do the microbiota that sustain them, and interactions among these players may drive the development of crop diseases. To learn more about how the microbiota of one species may affect the other, we isolated and identified microbes from field-caught D. suzukii, and then characterized their effects on D. melanogaster larval development time in the laboratory. We found that the D. suzukii microbiota consistently included both yeasts and bacteria. It was dominated by yeasts of the genus Hanseniaspora, and bacteria from the families Acetobacteraceae and Enterobacteriaceae. Raising D. melanogaster under gnotobiotic conditions with each microbial isolate individually, we found that some bacteria promoted larval development relative to axenic conditions, but most did not have a significant effect. In contrast, nearly all the yeasts tested significantly accelerated larval development. The one exception was Starmerella bacillaris, which had the opposite effect: significantly slowing larval developmental rate. We investigated the basis for this effect by examining whether S. bacillaris cells could sustain larval growth, and measuring the survival of S. bacillaris and other yeasts in the larval gut. Our results suggest S. bacillaris is not digested by D. melanogaster and therefore cannot serve as a source of nutrition. These findings have interesting implications for possible interactions between the two Drosophilia species and their microbiota in nature. Overall, we found that microbes isolated from D. suzukii promote D. melanogaster larval development, which is consistent with the model that infestation of fruit by D. suzukii can open up habitat for D. melanogaster. We propose that the microbiome is an important dimension of the ecological interactions between Drosophila species.",2019,"Gabrielle M Solomon, Hiruni Dodangoda, Tylea McCarthy-Walker, Rita Ntim-Gyakari, Peter D Newell"
Evolution of a central neural circuit underlies Drosophila mate preferences,29995860,10.1038/s41586-018-0322-9,"Courtship rituals serve to reinforce reproductive barriers between closely related species. Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans exhibit reproductive isolation, owing in part to the fact that D. melanogaster females produce 7,11-heptacosadiene, a pheromone that promotes courtship in D. melanogaster males but suppresses courtship in D. simulans males. Here we compare pheromone-processing pathways in D. melanogaster and D. simulans males to define how these sister species endow 7,11-heptacosadiene with the opposite behavioural valence to underlie species discrimination. We show that males of both species detect 7,11-heptacosadiene using homologous peripheral sensory neurons, but this signal is differentially propagated to P1 neurons, which control courtship behaviour. A change in the balance of excitation and inhibition onto courtship-promoting neurons transforms an excitatory pheromonal cue in D. melanogaster into an inhibitory cue in D. simulans. Our results reveal how species-specific pheromone responses can emerge from conservation of peripheral detection mechanisms and diversification of central circuitry, and demonstrate how flexible nodes in neural circuits can contribute to behavioural evolution.",2018,"Laura F Seeholzer, Max Seppo, David L Stern, Vanessa Ruta"
Immunity in Drosophila melanogaster--from microbial recognition to whole-organism physiology,25421701,10.1038/nri3763,"Since the discovery of antimicrobial peptide responses 40 years ago, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has proven to be a powerful model for the study of innate immunity. Early work focused on innate immune mechanisms of microbial recognition and subsequent nuclear factor-κB signal transduction. More recently, D. melanogaster has been used to understand how the immune response is regulated and coordinated at the level of the whole organism. For example, researchers have used this model in studies investigating interactions between the microbiota and the immune system at barrier epithelial surfaces that ensure proper nutritional and immune homeostasis both locally and systemically. In addition, studies in D. melanogaster have been pivotal in uncovering how the immune response is regulated by both endocrine and metabolic signalling systems, and how the immune response modifies these systems as part of a homeostatic circuit. In this Review, we briefly summarize microbial recognition and antiviral immunity in D. melanogaster, and we highlight recent studies that have explored the effects of organism-wide regulation of the immune response and, conversely, the effects of the immune response on organism physiology.",2014,"Nicolas Buchon, Neal Silverman, Sara Cherry"
Carnivory in the larvae of Drosophila melanogaster and other Drosophila species,30341324,10.1038/s41598-018-33906-w,"Drosophila melanogaster is widely used as a model organism for biological investigations, and food is a major aspect of its ecology and evolutionary biology. Previous studies have shown that this insect can use fruits, yeasts and insect carcasses as its food sources. In this study, we demonstrate that this species is an omnivore, that its larvae can exploit not only fruits and yeast but also foods of animal origin (FAOs), and that larvae consume adult carcasses regularly. FAO-fed larvae develop into adulthood within a normal developmental time frame without the help of microbes. Yeast foods are better for Drosophila development than are foods of plant origin (FPOs) or FAO because in yeast foods, more eggs complete their life cycle, and the body size of emerged flies is much greater. Flies can use a mixture of yeast-FAO, which significantly boosts female fertility. Larvae digest FAOs externally. Larval D. virilis, D. hydei, and D. simulans are also omnivorous and demonstrate the same feeding habits as larval D. melanogaster. These findings prompt us to reconsider previous conclusions about the original adaptations of D. melanogaster and other Drosophila species and have direct implications for diet-related studies using Drosophila as a model organism.",2018,Daxiang Yang
Can Drosophila melanogaster tell who's who?,30356241,10.1371/journal.pone.0205043,"Drosophila melanogaster are known to live in a social but cryptic world of touch and odours, but the extent to which they can perceive and integrate static visual information is a hotly debated topic. Some researchers fixate on the limited resolution of D. melanogaster's optics, others on their seemingly identical appearance; yet there is evidence of individual recognition and surprising visual learning in flies. Here, we apply machine learning and show that individual D. melanogaster are visually distinct. We also use the striking similarity of Drosophila's visual system to current convolutional neural networks to theoretically investigate D. melanogaster's capacity for visual understanding. We find that, despite their limited optical resolution, D. melanogaster's neuronal architecture has the capability to extract and encode a rich feature set that allows flies to re-identify individual conspecifics with surprising accuracy. These experiments provide a proof of principle that Drosophila inhabit a much more complex visual world than previously appreciated.",2018,"Jonathan Schneider, Nihal Murali, Graham W Taylor, Joel D Levine"
Wolbachia infections in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans: polymorphism and levels of cytoplasmic incompatibility,15088646,10.1023/b:gene.0000017629.31383.8f,"Wolbachia are endosymbiotic bacteria, widespread in terrestrial Arthropods. They are mainly transmitted vertically, from mothers to offspring and induce various alterations of their hosts' sexuality and reproduction, the most commonly reported phenomenon being Cytoplasmic Incompatibility (CI), observed in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. Basically, CI results in a more or less intense embryonic mortality, occurring in crosses between males infected by Wolbachia and uninfected females. In D. simulans, Wolbachia and CI were observed in 1986. Since then, this host species has become a model system for investigating the polymorphism of Wolbachia infections and CI. In this review we describe the different Wolbachia infections currently known to occur in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. The two species are highly contrasting with regard to symbiotic diversity: while five Wolbachia variants have been described in D. simulans natural populations, D. melanogaster seems to harbor one Wolbachia variant only. Another marked difference between these two Drosophila species is their permissiveness with regard to CI, which seems to be fully expressed in D. simulans but partially or totally repressed in D. melanogaster, demonstrating the involvement of host factors in the control of CI levels. The potential of the two host species regarding the understanding of CI and its evolution is also discussed.",2004,"Hervé Merçot, Sylvain Charlat"
Drosophila melanogaster establishes a species-specific mutualistic interaction with stable gut-colonizing bacteria,29975680,10.1371/journal.pbio.2005710,"Animals live together with diverse bacteria that can impact their biology. In Drosophila melanogaster, gut-associated bacterial communities are relatively simple in composition but also have a strong impact on host development and physiology. It is generally assumed that gut bacteria in D. melanogaster are transient and their constant ingestion with food is required to maintain their presence in the gut. Here, we identify bacterial species from wild-caught D. melanogaster that stably associate with the host independently of continuous inoculation. Moreover, we show that specific Acetobacter wild isolates can proliferate in the gut. We further demonstrate that the interaction between D. melanogaster and the wild isolated Acetobacter thailandicus is mutually beneficial and that the stability of the gut association is key to this mutualism. The stable population in the gut of D. melanogaster allows continuous bacterial spreading into the environment, which is advantageous to the bacterium itself. The bacterial dissemination is in turn advantageous to the host because the next generation of flies develops in the presence of this particularly beneficial bacterium. A. thailandicus leads to a faster host development and higher fertility of emerging adults when compared to other bacteria isolated from wild-caught flies. Furthermore, A. thailandicus is sufficient and advantageous when D. melanogaster develops in axenic or freshly collected figs, respectively. This isolate of A. thailandicus colonizes several genotypes of D. melanogaster but not the closely related D. simulans, indicating that the stable association is host specific. This work establishes a new conceptual model to understand D. melanogaster-gut microbiota interactions in an ecological context; stable interactions can be mutualistic through microbial farming, a common strategy in insects. Moreover, these results develop the use of D. melanogaster as a model to study gut microbiota proliferation and colonization.",2018,"Inês S Pais, Rita S Valente, Marta Sporniak, Luis Teixeira"
Pequi enriched diets protect Drosophila melanogaster against paraquat-induced locomotor deficits and oxidative stress,31317820,10.1080/15287394.2019.1642277,"The species Caryocar coriaceum Wittm (C. coriaceum), is popularly employed in northeast of Brazil for culinary purposes and in folk medicine. The oil from its fruit, deignated Pequi, is commonly used to treat inflammatory problems, and its leaves to treat viral infections. However, comprehensive knowledge regarding the pharmacological properties attributed to these plant parts is still scarce. Thus, this study aimed to explore the in vivo antioxidant potential of aqueous extract of the leaves (AEL) and Pequi pulp oil (PPO) on the pro-oxidative effects induced by paraquat (PQ) using Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster) as a model. These flies were fed with either standard or AEL and PPO supplemented diets prior to (pre-treatment for 7 days) or concomitantly (co-treatment for 5 days) with PQ. D. melanogaster administered PQ exhibited locomotor deficits and a higher rate of mortality. PQ induced significant changes in the antioxidant/oxidant status of D. melanogaster, including significant (1) increase in levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation; (2) elevation in the activity of antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and marked up-regulation in mRNA expression of stress-related genes for CAT, superoxide dismutase (SOD), thioredoxin reductase and Keap-1. Aside for mortality rates, AEL and PPO treatments reduced PQ-induced oxidative stress and motor impairments. No apparent evidence of toxicity was observed in D. melanogaster fed with AEL and PPO alone.

Wolbachia transfer from Drosophila melanogaster into D. simulans: Host effect and cytoplasmic incompatibility relationships,9725842,,"Wolbachia are maternally transmitted endocellular bacteria causing a reproductive incompatibility called cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in several arthropod species, including Drosophila. CI results in embryonic mortality in incompatible crosses. The only bacterial strain known to infect Drosophila melanogaster (wDm) was transferred from a D. melanogaster isofemale line into uninfected D. simulans isofemale lines by embryo microinjections. Males from the resulting transinfected lines induce >98% embryonic mortality when crossed with uninfected D. simulans females. In contrast, males from the donor D. melanogaster line induce only 18-32% CI on average when crossed with uninfected D. melanogaster females. Transinfected D. simulans lines do not differ from the D. melanogaster donor line in the Wolbachia load found in the embryo or in the total bacterial load of young males. However, >80% of cysts are infected by Wolbachia in the testes of young transinfected males, whereas only 8% of cysts are infected in young males from the D. melanogaster donor isofemale line. This difference might be caused by physiological differences between hosts, but it might also involve tissue-specific control of Wolbachia density by D. melanogaster. The wDm-transinfected D. simulans lines are unidirectionally incompatible with strains infected by the non-CI expressor Wolbachia strains wKi, wMau, or wAu, and they are bidirectionally incompatible with strains infected by the CI-expressor Wolbachia strains wHa or wNo. However, wDm-infected males do not induce CI toward females infected by the CI-expressor strain wRi, which is found in D. simulans continental populations, while wRi-infected males induce partial CI toward wDm-infected females. This peculiar asymmetrical pattern could reflect an ongoing divergence between the CI mechanisms of wRi and wDm. It would also confirm other results indicating that the factor responsible for CI induction in males is distinct from the factor responsible for CI rescue in females.",1998,"D Poinsot, K Bourtzis, G Markakis, C Savakis, H Merçot"
Wolbachia-mediated protection of Drosophila melanogaster against systemic infection with its natural viral pathogen Drosophila C virus does not involve changes in levels of highly abundant miRNAs,29676724,10.1099/jgv.0.001064,"The presence of Wolbachia confers virus protection to insects. The molecular mechanism underlying Wolbachia-mediated protection in this tripartite host-endosymbiont-virus interaction is not yet fully understood. In the bipartite association between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila C virus (DCV), changes in the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) influence the outcome of viral pathogenesis. Here we examined whether changes in miRNA expression are similarly involved in the Drosophila-Wolbachia-DCV association. The levels of highly abundant miRNAs in D. melanogaster, Wolbachia-mono-infected D. melanogaster, and DCV- and Wolbachia-bi-infected D. melanogaster were quantified using RT-qPCR and compared. The results show that the abundance of the 17 tested D. melanogaster miRNAs is not affected by Wolbachia endosymbiosis or by bi-infection of Wolbachia and DCV. These results suggest that the in vivo protection conferred by Wolbachia to its native host against D. melanogaster's natural pathogen DCV is not likely to be dependent on or associated with changes in the levels of highly expressed miRNAs.",2018,"Verna Monsanto-Hearne, Karyn N Johnson"
Invasive Drosophila suzukii facilitates Drosophila melanogaster infestation and sour rot outbreaks in the vineyards,28405407,10.1098/rsos.170117,"How do invasive pests affect interactions between members of pre-existing agrosystems? The invasive pest Drosophila suzukii is suspected to be involved in the aetiology of sour rot, a grapevine disease that otherwise develops following Drosophila melanogaster infestation of wounded berries. We combined field observations with laboratory assays to disentangle the relative roles of both Drosophila in disease development. We observed the emergence of numerous D. suzukii, but no D. melanogaster flies, from bunches that started showing mild sour rot symptoms days after field collection. However, bunches that already showed severe rot symptoms in the field mostly contained D. melanogaster. In the laboratory, oviposition by D. suzukii triggered sour rot development. An independent assay showed the disease increased grape attractiveness to ovipositing D. melanogaster females. Our results suggest that in invaded vineyards, D. suzukii facilitates D. melanogaster infestation and, consequently, favours sour rot outbreaks. Rather than competing with close species, the invader subsequently permits their reproduction in otherwise non-accessible resources and may cause more frequent, or more extensive, disease outbreaks.",2017,"A Rombaut, R Guilhot, A Xuéreb, L Benoit, M P Chapuis, P Gibert, S Fellous"
Wild African Drosophila melanogaster Are Seasonal Specialists on Marula Fruit,30528579,10.1016/j.cub.2018.10.033,"Although the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster is arguably the most studied organism on the planet, fundamental aspects of this species' natural ecology have remained enigmatic [1]. We have here investigated a wild population of D. melanogaster from a mopane forest in Zimbabwe. We find that these flies are closely associated with marula fruit (Sclerocarya birrea) and propose that this seasonally abundant and predominantly Southern African fruit is a key ancestral host of D. melanogaster. Moreover, when fruiting, marula is nearly exclusively used by D. melanogaster, suggesting that these forest-dwelling D. melanogaster are seasonal specialists, in a similar manner to, e.g., Drosophila erecta on screw pine cones [2]. We further demonstrate that the main chemicals released by marula activate odorant receptors that mediate species-specific host choice (Or22a) [3, 4] and oviposition site selection (Or19a) [5]. The Or22a-expressing neurons-ab3A-respond strongly to the marula ester ethyl isovalerate, a volatile rarely encountered in high amounts in other fruit. We also show that Or22a differs among African populations sampled from a wide range of habitats, in line with a function associated with host fruit usage. Flies from Southern Africa, most of which carry a distinct allele at the Or22a/Or22b locus, have ab3A neurons that are more sensitive to ethyl isovalerate than, e.g., European flies. Finally, we discuss the possibility that marula, which is also a culturally and nutritionally important resource to humans, may have helped the transition to commensalism in D. melanogaster.",2018,"Suzan Mansourian, Anders Enjin, Erling V Jirle, Vedika Ramesh, Guillermo Rehermann, Paul G Becher, John E Pool, Marcus C Stensmyr"

A female D. melanogaster copulates more readily when given a conspecific type of courtship song. Female D. melanogaster accepted winged D. sechellia more than wingless ones in a no choice test. Copulation frequencies varied between strains and were significantly correlated with male mating propensity of D. sechellia. Females from three of five strains of D. sechellia accepted winged D. melanogaster less than wingless ones in no choice tests, suggesting that D. melanogaster songs reduce mating in D. sechellia females. Multiple choice tests showed that males prefer conspecifics. In female choice tests, D. melanogaster females copulated with winged heterospecific D. sechellia males more than with wingless conspecific D. melanogaster males in the confined condition, suggesting that song differences between D. melanogaster and D. sechellia affect D. melanogaster females less than the absence of courtship song.

Bacterial Methionine Metabolism Genes Influence Drosophila melanogaster Starvation Resistance,29934334,10.1128/AEM.00662-18,"Animal-associated microorganisms (microbiota) dramatically influence the nutritional and physiological traits of their hosts. To expand our understanding of such influences, we predicted bacterial genes that influence a quantitative animal trait by a comparative genomic approach, and we extended these predictions via mutant analysis. We focused on Drosophila melanogaster starvation resistance (SR). We first confirmed that D. melanogaster SR responds to the microbiota by demonstrating that bacterium-free flies have greater SR than flies bearing a standard 5-species microbial community, and we extended this analysis by revealing the species-specific influences of 38 genome-sequenced bacterial species on D. melanogaster SR. A subsequent metagenome-wide association analysis predicted bacterial genes with potential influence on D. melanogaster SR, among which were significant enrichments in bacterial genes for the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids and B vitamins. Dietary supplementation experiments established that the addition of methionine, but not B vitamins, to the diets significantly lowered D. melanogaster SR in a way that was additive, but not interactive, with the microbiota. A direct role for bacterial methionine metabolism genes in D. melanogaster SR was subsequently confirmed by analysis of flies that were reared individually with distinct methionine cycle Escherichia coli mutants. The correlated responses of D. melanogaster SR to bacterial methionine metabolism mutants and dietary modification are consistent with the established finding that bacteria can influence fly phenotypes through dietary modification, although we do not provide explicit evidence of this conclusion. Taken together, this work reveals that D. melanogaster SR is a microbiota-responsive trait, and specific bacterial genes underlie these influences.IMPORTANCE Extending descriptive studies of animal-associated microorganisms (microbiota) to define causal mechanistic bases for their influence on animal traits is an emerging imperative. In this study, we reveal that D. melanogaster starvation resistance (SR), a model quantitative trait in animal genetics, responds to the presence and identity of the microbiota. Using a predictive analysis, we reveal that the amino acid methionine has a key influence on D. melanogaster SR and show that bacterial methionine metabolism mutants alter normal patterns of SR in flies bearing the bacteria. Our data further suggest that these effects are additive, and we propose the untested hypothesis that, similar to bacterial effects on fruit fly triacylglyceride deposition, the bacterial influence may be through dietary modification. Together, these findings expand our understanding of the bacterial genetic basis for influence on a nutritionally relevant trait of a model animal host.",2018,"Alec M Judd, Melinda K Matthews, Rachel Hughes, Madeline Veloz, Corinne E Sexton, John M Chaston"

In view of this, seleno-compounds have been investigated as MeHg antidotes. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of the co-exposure to MeHg and the seleno-compound diphenyl diselenide (PhSe)2 on Drosophila melanogaster. We measured the survival rate, developmental survival, locomotor ability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and Hg levels in D. melanogaster exposed to MeHg and/or (PhSe)2 in the food. Exposure to MeHg caused a reduction in the survival rate, developmental survival, and locomotion in D. melanogaster. In addition, MeHg increased the ROS production and mercury levels in flies. The co-exposure to MeHg and (PhSe)2 did not prevent the toxic effects of MeHg in D. melanogaster. On the contrary, the co-exposure enhanced the toxic effects on the locomotor ability and developmental survival. This effect may be explained by the fact that the co-exposure increased the Hg levels in body when compared to flies exposed only to MeHg, suggesting that MeHg and (PhSe)2 interaction may increase Hg body burden in D. melanogaster which could contribute for the increased toxicity observed in the co-exposure.",2018,"Mayara B Leão, Paulo C C da Rosa, Caroline Wagner, Thiago H Lugokenski, Cristiane L Dalla Corte"

Duplication of Drosophila melanogaster mitochondrial EF-Tu: pre-adaptation to T-arm truncation and exclusion of bulky aminoacyl residues,28130490,10.1042/BCJ20160929,"Translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) delivers aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) to ribosomes in protein synthesis. EF-Tu generally recognizes aminoacyl moieties and acceptor- and T-stems of aa-tRNAs. However, nematode mitochondrial (mt) tRNAs frequently lack all or part of the T-arm that is recognized by canonical EF-Tu. We previously reported that two distinct EF-Tu species, EF-Tu1 and EF-Tu2, respectively, recognize mt tRNAs lacking T-arms and D-arms in the mitochondria of the chromadorean nematode Caenorhabditis elegansC. elegans EF-Tu2 specifically recognizes the seryl moiety of serylated D-armless tRNAs. Mitochondria of the enoplean nematode Trichinella possess three structural types of tRNAs: T-armless tRNAs, D-armless tRNAs, and cloverleaf tRNAs with a short T-arm. Trichinella mt EF-Tu1 binds to all three types and EF-Tu2 binds only to D-armless Ser-tRNAs, showing an evolutionary intermediate state from canonical EF-Tu to chromadorean nematode (e.g. C. elegans) EF-Tu species. We report here that two EF-Tu species also participate in Drosophila melanogaster mitochondria. Both D. melanogaster EF-Tu1 and EF-Tu2 bound to cloverleaf and D-armless tRNAs. D. melanogaster EF-Tu1 has the ability to recognize T-armless tRNAs that do not evidently exist in D. melanogaster mitochondria, but do exist in related arthropod species. In addition, D. melanogaster EF-Tu2 preferentially bound to aa-tRNAs carrying small amino acids, but not to aa-tRNAs carrying bulky amino acids.

Comparative Analysis of Satellite DNA in the Drosophila melanogaster Species Complex,28007840,10.1534/g3.116.035352,"Satellite DNAs are highly repetitive sequences that account for the majority of constitutive heterochromatin in many eukaryotic genomes. It is widely recognized that sequences and locations of satellite DNAs are highly divergent even in closely related species, contributing to the hypothesis that satellite DNA differences may underlie speciation. However, due to its repetitive nature, the mapping of satellite DNAs has been mostly left out of recent genomics analyses, hampering the use of molecular genetics techniques to better understand their role in speciation and evolution. Satellite DNAs are most extensively and comprehensively mapped in Drosophila melanogaster, a species that is also an excellent model system with which to study speciation. Yet the lack of comprehensive knowledge regarding satellite DNA identity and location in its sibling species (D. simulans, D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia) has prevented the full utilization of D. melanogaster in studying speciation. To overcome this problem, we initiated the mapping of satellite DNAs on the genomes of the D. melanogaster species complex (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia) using multi-color fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) probes. Our study confirms a striking divergence of satellite DNAs in the D. melanogaster species complex, even among the closely related species of the D. simulans clade (D. simulans, D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia), and suggests the presence of unidentified satellite sequences in these species.",2017,"Madhav Jagannathan, Natalie Warsinger-Pepe, George J Watase, Yukiko M Yamashita"
Drosophila melanogaster in nutrition research-the importance of standardizing experimental diets,30766617,10.1186/s12263-019-0627-9,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been increasingly recognized as an important model organism in nutrition research. In order to conduct nutritional studies in fruit flies, special attention should be given to the composition of the experimental diets. Besides complex diets, which are often based on maize, yeast, sucrose, and agar, Drosophila can be also fed chemically defined diets. These so-called holidic diets are standardized in terms of their macro- and micronutrient composition although the quantitative nutrient requirements of flies have yet not been fully established and warrant further investigations. For instance, only few studies address the fatty acid, vitamin, mineral, and trace element requirements of fruit flies. D. melanogaster may be also of interest in the field of nutritional medicine. Diet-induced diabetes and obesity models have been established, and in this context, often, the so-called high-fat and high-sugar diets are fed. However, the composition of these diets is not sufficiently defined and varies between studies. A consensus within the scientific community needs to be reached to standardize the exact composition of experimental complex and holidic diets for D. melanogaster in nutrition research. Since D. melanogaster is an established valuable model system for numerous human diseases, standardized diets are also a prerequisite to conduct diet-disease interaction studies. We suggest that a comprehensive approach, which combines deep phenotyping with disease-related Drosophila models under defined dietary conditions, might lead to the foundation of a so-called fly clinic.",2019,"Kai Lüersen, Thomas Röder, Gerald Rimbach"
"Isolation of a natural DNA virus of Drosophila melanogaster, and characterisation of host resistance and immune responses",29864164,10.1371/journal.ppat.1007050,"Drosophila melanogaster has played a key role in our understanding of invertebrate immunity. However, both functional and evolutionary studies of host-virus interaction in Drosophila have been limited by a dearth of native virus isolates. In particular, despite a long history of virus research, DNA viruses of D. melanogaster have only recently been described, and none have been available for experimental study. Here we report the isolation and comprehensive characterisation of Kallithea virus, a large double-stranded DNA virus, and the first DNA virus to have been reported from wild populations of D. melanogaster. We find that Kallithea virus infection is costly for adult flies, reaching high titres in both sexes and disproportionately reducing survival in males, and movement and late fecundity in females. Using the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, we quantify host genetic variance for virus-induced mortality and viral titre and identify candidate host genes that may underlie this variation, including Cdc42-interacting protein 4. Using full transcriptome sequencing of infected males and females, we examine the transcriptional response of flies to Kallithea virus infection and describe differential regulation of virus-responsive genes. This work establishes Kallithea virus as a new tractable model to study the natural interaction between D. melanogaster and DNA viruses, and we hope it will serve as a basis for future studies of immune responses to DNA viruses in insects.",2018,"William H Palmer, Nathan C Medd, Philippa M Beard, Darren J Obbard"
The neurogenetics of group behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,28057826,10.1242/jeb.141457,"Organisms rarely act in isolation. Their decisions and movements are often heavily influenced by direct and indirect interactions with conspecifics. For example, we each represent a single node within a social network of family and friends, and an even larger network of strangers. This group membership can affect our opinions and actions. Similarly, when in a crowd, we often coordinate our movements with others like fish in a school, or birds in a flock. Contributions of the group to individual behaviors are observed across a wide variety of taxa but their biological mechanisms remain largely unknown. With the advent of powerful computational tools as well as the unparalleled genetic accessibility and surprisingly rich social life of Drosophila melanogaster, researchers now have a unique opportunity to investigate molecular and neuronal determinants of group behavior. Conserved mechanisms and/or selective pressures in D. melanogaster can likely inform a much wider phylogenetic scale. Here, we highlight two examples to illustrate how quantitative and genetic tools can be combined to uncover mechanisms of two group behaviors in D. melanogaster: social network formation and collective behavior. Lastly, we discuss future challenges towards a full understanding how coordinated brain activity across many individuals gives rise to the behavioral patterns of animal societies.",2017,"Pavan Ramdya, Jonathan Schneider, Joel D Levine"
Quantifying Abdominal Pigmentation in Drosophila melanogaster,28605370,10.3791/55732,"Pigmentation is a morphologically simple but highly variable trait that often has adaptive significance. It has served extensively as a model for understanding the development and evolution of morphological phenotypes. Abdominal pigmentation in Drosophila melanogaster has been particularly useful, allowing researchers to identify the loci that underlie inter- and intraspecific variations in morphology. Hitherto, however, D. melanogaster abdominal pigmentation has been largely assayed qualitatively, through scoring, rather than quantitatively, which limits the forms of statistical analysis that can be applied to pigmentation data. This work describes a new methodology that allows for the quantification of various aspects of the abdominal pigmentation pattern of adult D. melanogaster. The protocol includes specimen mounting, image capture, data extraction, and analysis. All the software used for image capture and analysis feature macros written for open-source image analysis. The advantage of this approach is the ability to precisely measure pigmentation traits using a methodology that is highly reproducible across different imaging systems. While the technique has been used to measure variation in the tergal pigmentation patterns of adult D. melanogaster, the methodology is flexible and broadly applicable to pigmentation patterns in myriad different organisms.",2017,"Omid Saleh Ziabari, Alexander W Shingleton"

The genetic basis of female pheromone differences between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans,29777168,10.1038/s41437-018-0080-3,"Chemical signals are one means by which many insect species communicate. Differences in the combination of surface chemicals called cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) can influence mating behavior and affect reproductive isolation between species. Genes influencing three CHC compounds have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster. However, the genetic basis of other CHC compounds, whether these genes affect species differences in CHCs, and the genes' resulting effect on interspecies mating, remains unknown. We used fine-scale deficiency mapping of the third chromosome to identify 43 genomic regions that influence production of CHCs in both D. melanogaster and Drosophila simulans females. We identified an additional 23 small genomic regions that affect interspecies divergence in CHCs between females of these two species, one of which spans two genes known to influence the production of multiple CHCs within D. melanogaster. By testing these genes individually, we determined that desat1 also affects interspecific divergence in one CHC compound, while desat2 has no effect on interspecific divergence. Thus, some but not all genes affecting intraspecific amounts of CHCs also affect interspecific divergence, but not all genes or all CHCs. Lastly, we find no evidence of a relationship between the CHC profile and female attractiveness or receptivity towards D. melanogaster males.",2019,"Jessica A Pardy, Howard D Rundle, Mark A Bernards, Amanda J Moehring"
Drosophila melanogaster as a High-Throughput Model for Host-Microbiota Interactions,28503170,10.3389/fmicb.2017.00751,"Microbiota research often assumes that differences in abundance and identity of microorganisms have unique influences on host physiology. To test this concept mechanistically, germ-free mice are colonized with microbial communities to assess causation. Due to the cost, infrastructure challenges, and time-consuming nature of germ-free mouse models, an alternative approach is needed to investigate host-microbial interactions. Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) can be used as a high throughput in vivo screening model of host-microbiome interactions as they are affordable, convenient, and replicable. D. melanogaster were essential in discovering components of the innate immune response to pathogens. However, axenic D. melanogaster can easily be generated for microbiome studies without the need for ethical considerations. The simplified microbiota structure enables researchers to evaluate permutations of how each microbial species within the microbiota contribute to host phenotypes of interest. This enables the possibility of thorough strain-level analysis of host and microbial properties relevant to physiological outcomes. Moreover, a wide range of mutant D. melanogaster strains can be affordably obtained from public stock centers. Given this, D. melanogaster can be used to identify candidate mechanisms of host-microbe symbioses relevant to pathogen exclusion, innate immunity modulation, diet, xenobiotics, and probiotic/prebiotic properties in a high throughput manner. This perspective comments on the most promising areas of microbiota research that could immediately benefit from using the D. melanogaster model.",2017,"Mark Trinder, Brendan A Daisley, Josh S Dube, Gregor Reid"
Cellular Responses in Drosophila melanogaster Following Teratogen Exposure,29896697,10.1007/978-1-4939-7883-0_13,"Studies focusing on the teratogenicity of a series of new chemicals that are produced in a daily basis represent an important focus in toxicological/pharmaceutical research, particularly due to the risks arising from occupational exposure of the subjects. However, the complex mating procedures, scheduling of treatments, requirements for trained personnel, and elevated costs of traditional teratological assays with mammals hamper this type of assessments. Accordingly, the use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model for teratological studies has received considerable attention. Here some general protocols about Drosophila exposure-at different stages of their life cycle-to any chemical with putative teratological activity are presented. Importantly, some details about D. melanogaster embryonic, larval, pupal, or adult endpoints, that can be used to assess teratogenicity using flies as a model organism, are presented.",2018,"Matheus C Bianchini, José L R Portela, Robson L Puntel, Daiana S Ávila"

We investigated whether this parasitoid could also circumvent the immune reaction of D. simulans, a sibling species of D. melanogaster. The rates of infestation, successful parasitism, total encapsulation and mortality were measured after complete development of both D. melanogaster and D. simulans larvae parasitized by A. citri. Results showed that the parasitoids were almost never encapsulated in D. melanogaster larvae, while 45% were encapsulated in D. simulans. A. citri induced a targeted disruption of the hematopoietic organs and a decrease of the hemocytes load in host larvae of both species. Despite such disruptive immune effects most D. simulans larvae succeeded in encapsulating A. citri eggs, probably thanks to their ability to immediately mount a capsule after infestation.

Introgression of Drosophila simulans nuclear pore protein 160 in Drosophila melanogaster alone does not cause inviability but does cause female sterility,20647504,10.1534/genetics.110.119867,"We have been analyzing genes for reproductive isolation by replacing Drosophila melanogaster genes with homologs from Drosophila simulans by interspecific backcrossing. Among the introgressions established, we found that a segment of the left arm of chromosome 2, Int(2L)S, carried recessive genes for hybrid sterility and inviability. That nuclear pore protein 160 (Nup160) in the introgression region is involved in hybrid inviability, as suggested by others, was confirmed by the present analysis. Male hybrids carrying an X chromosome of D. melanogaster were not rescued by the Lethal hybrid rescue (Lhr) mutation when the D. simulans Nup160 allele was made homozygous or hemizygous. Furthermore, we uniquely found that Nup160 is also responsible for hybrid sterility. Females were sterile when D. simulans Nup160 was made homozygous or hemizygous in the D. melanogaster genetic background. Genetic analyses indicated that the D. simulans Nup160 introgression into D. melanogaster was sufficient to cause female sterility but that other autosomal genes of D. simulans were also necessary to cause lethality. The involvement of Nup160 in hybrid inviability and female sterility was confirmed by transgene experiment.",2010,"Kyoichi Sawamura, Kazunori Maehara, Shotaro Mashino, Tatsuo Kagesawa, Miyuki Kajiwara, Kenji Matsuno, Aya Takahashi, Toshiyuki Takano-Shimizu"

Geographical analysis of diapause inducibility in European Drosophila melanogaster populations,28131702,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.01.015,"Seasonal overwintering in insects represents an adaptation to stressful environments and in European Drosophila melanogaster females, low temperatures and short photoperiods can induce an ovarian diapause. Diapause may represent a recent (<15Ky) adaptation to the colonisation of temperate Europe by D. melanogaster from tropical sub-Saharan Africa, because African D. melanogaster and the sibling species D. simulans, have been reported to fail to undergo diapause. Over the past few centuries, D. melanogaster have also invaded North America and Australia, and eastern populations on both continents show a predictable latitudinal cline in diapause induction. In Europe however, a new diapause-enhancing timeless allele, ls-tim, is observed at high levels in southern Italy (∼80%), where it appears to have arisen and has spread throughout the continent with a frequency of ∼20% in Scandinavia. Given the phenotype of ls-tim and its geographical distribution, we might predict that it would work against any latitudinal cline in diapause induction within Europe. Indeed we reveal that any latitudinal cline for diapause in Europe is very weak, as predicted by ls-tim frequencies. In contrast, we determine ls-tim frequencies in North America and observe that they would be expected to strengthen the latitudinal pattern of diapause. Our results reveal how a newly arisen mutation, can, via the stochastic nature of where it initially arose, blur an otherwise adaptive geographical pattern.",2017,"Mirko Pegoraro, Valeria Zonato, Elizabeth R Tyler, Giorgio Fedele, Charalambos P Kyriacou, Eran Tauber"
Lipidomic profiles of Drosophila melanogaster and cactophilic fly species: models of human metabolic diseases,29043354,10.1039/c7ib00155j,"The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with serious diseases and represents an important threat for global public health. The common fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) has served as a model organism to study physiological processes of the MetS, because central metabolic pathways are conserved among species, and because the flies are easy to cultivate in a laboratory. In nature, D. melanogaster is a fruit generalist, feeding on diets rich in simple carbohydrates. Other Drosophilids, however, have specialized on distinct resources. Drosophila mojavensis, for example, is endemic to the Sonoran Desert, where it feeds on necrotic cacti which are low in carbohydrates. Its close relative Drosophila arizonae is cactophilic as well, but is also found breeding in fruits containing simple sugars. Previous studies have shown that high-sugar diets negatively affect the larval development of D. mojavensis and increase their triglyceride content, compared to D. melanogaster. More general metabolic profiles, in response to these different diets, however, have yet to be produced for any of the species. In addition, because D. arizonae appears somewhat intermediate between D. melanogaster and D. mojavensis in its development times and survival under the above mentioned diets, its general metabolic profiles are also of interest. Thus, in the present study we ask to what extent the general metabolism of these three different Drosophila species is affected by diets of distinct protein-sugar ratios. To obtain an un-biased view on possibly novel phenomena, we combined untargeted metabolomics with Random Forest data mining.",2017,"Daniel Cázarez-García, Mariana Ramírez Loustalot-Laclette, Therese Ann Markow, Robert Winkler"
Reducing Drosophila suzukii emergence through inter-species competition,29266721,10.1002/ps.4836,"Background:
      
    

    
      Drosophila suzukii has dispersed widely from its native Asian range since 2008. Its arrival in the UK is resulting in economic losses in soft- and stone-fruit crops caused by larvae feeding on the flesh of ripening fruit. Although a large amount of research has been directed at controlling this pest, it is presently unknown how this invasive species interacts with native Drosophila species.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In the work reported here, D. suzukii or Drosophila melanogaster adults were introduced to substrates pre-inoculated with the eggs of the same or the other species in a laboratory choice assay. Drosophila melanogaster adult emergence was not affected by pre-inoculation with D. suzukii. The rate of emergence of D. suzukii was significantly lower from medium pre-inoculated by D. melanogaster than from blank medium. In a subsequent experiment, significantly more D. suzukii eggs were laid in blank medium than in D. melanogaster pre-inoculated medium.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:

"Divergence of the yellow gene between Drosophila melanogaster and D. subobscura: recombination rate, codon bias and synonymous substitutions",9286677,,"The yellow (y) gene maps near the telomere of the X chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster but not in D. subobscura. Thus the strong reduction in the recombination rate associated with telomeric regions is not expected in D. subobscura. To study the divergence of a gene whose recombination rate differs between two species, the y gene of D. subobscura was sequenced. Sequence comparison between D. melanogaster and D. subobscura revealed several elements conserved in noncoding regions that may correspond to putative cis-acting regulatory sequences. Divergence in the y gene coding region between D. subobscura and D. melanogaster was compared with that found in other genes sequenced in both species. Both, yellow and scute exhibit an unusually high number of synonymous substitutions per site (ps). Also for these genes, the extent of codon bias differs between both species, being much higher in D. subobscura than in D. melanogaster. This pattern of divergence is consistent with the hitchhiking and background selection models that predict an increase in the fixation rate of slightly deleterious mutations and a decrease in the rate of fixation of slightly advantageous mutations in regions with low recombination rates such as in the y-sc gene region of D. melanogaster.",1997,"A Munté, M Aguadé, C Segarra"
"Comparative Analysis of Drosophila melanogaster Gut Microbiota with Respect to Host Strain, Sex, and Age",28054304,10.1007/s00248-016-0925-3,"Microbiota has a significant impact on the health of the host individual. The complexity of the interactions between mammalian hosts and their microbiota highlights the value of using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism, because of its relatively simple microbial community and ease of physiological and genetic manipulation. However, highly variable and sometimes inconsistent results regarding the microbiota of D. melanogaster have been reported for host samples collected from different geographical locations; discrepancies that may be because of the inherent physiological conditions of the D. melanogaster host. Here, we conducted a comparative analysis of the gut microbiota of two D. melanogaster laboratory strains, w 1118 and Canton S, with respect to the sex and age of the host, by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. In addition to the widespread and abundant commensal bacterial genera Lactobacillus and Acetobacter, we identified Enterococcus and Leuconostoc as major host-strain-specific bacterial genera. The relative proportions of these bacterial genera, and those of the species within each, were found to differ markedly with respect to strain, sex, and age of the host, even though host individuals were reared under the same nutritional conditions. By using various bioinformatic tools, we uncovered several characteristic features of microbiota corresponding to specific categories of the flies: host-sex-bias association of specific bacteria, age-dependent alteration of microbiota across host species and sex, and uniqueness of the microbiota of female w 1118 flies. Our results, thus, help to further our understanding of host-microbe interactions in the D. melanogaster model.",2017,"Gangsik Han, Hyo Jung Lee, Sang Eun Jeong, Che Ok Jeon, Seogang Hyun"
The Drosophila melanogaster methuselah gene: a novel gene with ancient functions,23696853,10.1371/journal.pone.0063747,"The Drosophila melanogaster G protein-coupled receptor gene, methuselah (mth), has been described as a novel gene that is less than 10 million years old. Nevertheless, it shows a highly specific expression pattern in embryos, larvae, and adults, and has been implicated in larval development, stress resistance, and in the setting of adult lifespan, among others. Although mth belongs to a gene subfamily with 16 members in D. melanogaster, there is no evidence for functional redundancy in this subfamily. Therefore, it is surprising that a novel gene influences so many traits. Here, we explore the alternative hypothesis that mth is an old gene. Under this hypothesis, in species distantly related to D. melanogaster, there should be a gene with features similar to those of mth. By performing detailed phylogenetic, synteny, protein structure, and gene expression analyses we show that the D. virilis GJ12490 gene is the orthologous of mth in species distantly related to D. melanogaster. We also show that, in D. americana (a species of the virilis group of Drosophila), a common amino acid polymorphism at the GJ12490 orthologous gene is significantly associated with developmental time, size, and lifespan differences. Our results imply that GJ12490 orthologous genes are candidates for developmental time and lifespan differences in Drosophila in general.",2013,"Ana Rita Araújo, Micael Reis, Helder Rocha, Bruno Aguiar, Ramiro Morales-Hojas, Sandra Macedo-Ribeiro, Nuno A Fonseca, David Reboiro-Jato, Miguel Reboiro-Jato, Florentino Fdez-Riverola, Cristina P Vieira, Jorge Vieira"

We pay attention to how an understanding of D. melanogaster female reproductive behaviors contributes to a wider understanding of evolutionary processes such as pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection as well as sexual conflict. Within each section, we attempt to connect the theories that pertain to the evolution of female reproductive behaviors with the molecular and neurobiological data that support these theories.

Coevolution of Drosophila melanogaster mtDNA and Wolbachia genotypes,23349865,10.1371/journal.pone.0054373,"Maternally inherited microorganisms can influence the mtDNA pattern of variation in hosts. This influence is driven by selection among symbionts and can cause the frequency of mitochondrial variants in the population to eventually increase or decrease.

Phylogenetic analysis of D. melanogaster mtDNA revealed two clades diverged in Africa, each associated with one of the two Wolbachia genotype groups. No evidence of horizontal transmission of Wolbachia between maternal lineages has been found. All the mtDNA variants that occur in infected isofemale lines are found in uninfected isofemale lines and vice versa, which is indicative of a recent loss of infection from some maternal fly lineages and confirms a significant role of Wolbachia in the D. melanogaster mtDNA pattern of variation.

Development of a PCR-RFLP assay to identify Drosophila melanogaster among field-collected larvae,30397448,10.1002/ece3.4453,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a model organism to study several aspects of metazoan biology. Most of the work has been conducted in adult fruit flies, including laboratory and field-derived specimens, but Drosophila melanogaster larvae recently became a valuable model to better understand animal physiology, development, or host-microbe interactions. While adult flies can be easily assigned to a given Drosophila species based on morphological characteristics, such visual identification is more intricate at the larval stage. This could explain the limited number of studies focusing on larvae, especially field-derived samples. Here, we developed a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay that discriminates D. melanogaster from other ecologically relevant Drosophila species at the larval stage. The method, which targets the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene, was validated using laboratory-derived larvae from seven D. melanogaster populations originating from different geographic areas as well as six Drosophila species. We further validated this PCR-RFLP assay in a natural context, by identifying wild larvae collected in two locations in France.

Variation in response to CO2 in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans,6408161,10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a109756,"A type of slow-recovery from high temperature CO2 exposure is a wild-type characteristic of Drosophila simulans. Species hybrids of wild-type D. melanogaster and D. simulans have intermediate recovery times. The response to nitrogen exposure at both high and low temperatures is the same for the two species suggesting that the observed CO2 response is more than just anoxia. Since there is no female bias in hybrids, and since injections of D. simulans extract into D. melanogaster produced no increase in CO2 sensitivity in the recipients, we conclude that the prolonged recovery time results from genomic differences between D. simulans and D. melanogaster, and is not due to a sigma-like infectious agent.",1983,"W B McCrady, M A Clark"
"Courtship song recognition in the Drosophila melanogaster complex: heterospecific songs make females receptive in D. melanogaster, but not in D. sechellia",11005295,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00561.x,"The courtship song emitted by male wing vibration has been regarded as one of the most important signals in sexual isolation in the species of the Drosophila melanogaster complex. Inter- and intraspecific crosses were observed using males whose wings were removed (mute) or females whose aristae were removed (deaf). Females of D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. mauritiana mated with heterospecific males in the song-present condition (cross between normal females and winged males) more often than in the no-song condition (cross between normal females and wingless males or between aristaless females and winged males) or they showed no preference between the two conditions. It is possible that in these females heterospecific courtship songs play a role as if they were conspecific. In contrast, the females of D. sechellia mated with D. melanogaster or D. simulans males in the no-song condition more often than in the song-present condition, suggesting that they reject males with heterospecific song. Female mate recognition depending on the courtship song in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. mauritiana is considered to be relatively broader and that in D. sechellia narrower.",2000,"M Tomaru, M Doi, H Higuchi, Y Oguma"
Reduced fertility of Drosophila melanogaster hybrid male rescue (Hmr) mutant females is partially complemented by Hmr orthologs from sibling species,19153254,10.1534/genetics.108.100057,"The gene Hybrid male rescue (Hmr) causes lethality in interspecific hybrids between Drosophila melanogaster and its sibling species. Hmr has functionally diverged for this interspecific phenotype because lethality is caused specifically by D. melanogaster Hmr but not by D. simulans or D. mauritiana Hmr. Hmr was identified by the D. melanogaster partial loss-of-function allele Hmr1, which suppresses hybrid lethality but has no apparent phenotype within pure-species D. melanogaster. Here we have investigated the possible function of Hmr in D. melanogaster females using stronger mutant alleles. Females homozygous for Hmr mutants have reduced viability posteclosion and significantly reduced fertility. We find that reduced fertility of Hmr mutants is caused by a reduction in the number of eggs laid as well as reduced zygotic viability. Cytological analysis reveals that ovarioles from Hmr mutant females express markers that distinguish various stages of wild-type oogenesis, but that developing egg chambers fail to migrate posteriorly. D. simulans and D. mauritiana Hmr+ partially complement the reduced fertility of a D. melanogaster Hmr mutation. This partial complementation contrasts with the complete functional divergence previously observed for the interspecific hybrid lethality phenotype. We also investigate here the molecular basis of hybrid rescue associated with a second D. melanogaster hybrid rescue allele, In(1)AB. We show that In(1)AB is mutant for Hmr function, likely due to a missense mutation in an evolutionarily conserved amino acid. Two independently discovered hybrid rescue mutations are therefore allelic.",2009,"S Aruna, Heather A Flores, Daniel A Barbash"
Drosophila melanogaster model for Mycobacterium abscessus infection,23831804,10.1016/j.micinf.2013.06.011,"Mycobacterium abscessus is a human pathogen that is responsible for a broad spectrum of tissue infections and disseminated infections in immunodeficient patients.

Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a genetically tractable model host for M. abscessus. In this context, we infected D. melanogaster with M. abscessus. This M. abscessus infection results in dissemination in the fly body, followed by death, which is accompanied by severe indirect flight muscle and brain damage. Our data show that M. abscessus can grow and replicate in D. melanogaster w(1118) and that it elicited a humoral immune response, especially of the Toll antimicrobial peptide pathway.

Gut yeasts do not improve desiccation survival in Drosophila melanogaster,31170408,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2019.103893,"A healthy gut microbiota generally improves the performance of its insect host. Although the effects can be specific to the species composition of the microbial community, the role of gut microbiota in determining water balance has not been well explored. We used axenic and gnotobiotic (reared with a known microbiota) Drosophila melanogaster to test three hypotheses about the effects of gut yeasts on the water balance of adult flies: 1) that gut yeasts would improve desiccation survival in adult flies; 2) that larval yeasts would improve adult desiccation survival; 3) that the effects would be species-specific, such that yeasts closely associated with D. melanogaster in nature are more likely to be beneficial than those rarely found in association with D. melanogaster. We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae (often used in Drosophila cultures, but rarely associated with D. melanogaster in nature), Lachancea kluyveri (associated with some species of Drosophila, but not D. melanogaster), and Pichia kluyveri (associated with D. melanogaster in nature). Adult inoculation with yeasts had no effect on survival of desiccating conditions. Inoculation with P. kluyveri as larvae did not change desiccation survival in adults; however, rearing with L. kluyveri or S. cerevisiae reduced adult desiccation survival. We conclude that adult inoculation with gut yeasts has no impact on desiccation survival, but that rearing with yeasts can have either no or detrimental effect. The effects appear to be species-specific: P. kluyveri did not have a negative impact on desiccation tolerance, suggesting some level of co-adaptation with D. melanogaster.

Myotropic peptides in Drosophila melanogaster and the genes that encode them,12420787,,"Myotropic peptides are structurally dissimilar; thus, they comprise different families. The cellular expressions of myotropins suggest they act as hormones, transmitters, and modulators of numerous biological processes. Drosophila melanogaster allatostatin (AST), FMRFamide-containing, dromyosuppressin (DMS), and drosulfakinin (DSK) peptides represent four different myotropin families. A different gene encodes each of these four myotropin families. D. melanogaster AST, FMRFamide-containing, DMS, and DSK peptides are present in neural and gut tissue, but are not all expressed in the same cells. These four families of myotropins affect spontaneous contractions of gut, heart, and/or reproductive tissue, but their effects are dissimilar in magnitude and time course. Based on their structures, genes, distributions, and activities, the synthesis and release of these D. melanogaster myotropins are likely governed by different sensory inputs and regulatory mechanisms. The differences in structures, precursors, cellular expressions, and activities are consistent with the conclusion that they do not play redundant roles in their effects on the frequency of muscle contractions. Orthologs of these D. melanogaster myotropins exist in other animal species; thus, research on the mechanisms involved in their production and processing, functions, and signaling may be widely applicable. Here, we review research on D. melanogaster AST, FMRFamide-containing, myosuppressin, and sulfakinin peptides.",2002,"Ruthann Nichols, William G Bendena, Stephen S Tobe"

The nucleotide sequences of the D. pseudoobscura and D. melanogaster UO protein-coding regions are 82.2% identical whereas the deduced amino acid sequences are 87.6% identical with 42 amino acid changes, 33 of which occur in the first exon.

Using D. simulans synthetic lines with compound chromosomes from a population of the Seychelles Islands (high frequency of interspecific mating) and a multimarker strain (low frequency), we show that D. simulans males play an important role in discriminating D. melanogaster females. The genetics of male discrimination fits well with the inheritance mode of a single locus, dominant for sexual isolation, located in chromosome II near the net mutation (2L-0.0). The heterospecific mating success of the male was not related to his sexual vigor.

Here, we use whole-genome data from five populations (Africa, North America, Europe, Central Asia, and the South Pacific) to carry out demographic inferences, with particular attention to the inclusion of migration and admixture.

Allelic asymmetry of the Lethal hybrid rescue (Lhr) gene expression in the hybrid between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans: confirmation by using genetic variations of D. melanogaster,24379167,10.1007/s10709-013-9752-3,"In the cross between Drosophila melanogaster females and D. simulans males, hybrid males die at the late larval stage, and the sibling females also die at later stages at high temperatures. Removing the D. simulans allele of the Lethal hybrid rescue gene (Lhr (sim) ) improves the hybrid incompatibility phenotypes. However, the loss-of-function mutation of Lhr (sim) (Lhr (sim0) ) does not rescue the hybrid males in crosses with several D. melanogaster strains. We first describe the genetic factor possessed by the D. melanogaster strains. It has been suggested that removing the D. melanogaster allele of Lhr (Lhr (mel) ), that is Lhr (mel0) , does not have the hybrid male rescue effect, contrasting to Lhr (sim0) . Because the expression level of the Lhr gene is known to be Lhr (sim) > Lhr (mel) in the hybrid, Lhr (mel0) may not lead to enough of a reduction in total Lhr expression. Then, there is a possibility that the D. melanogaster factor changes the expression level to Lhr (sim) < Lhr (mel) . But in fact, the expression level was Lhr (sim) > Lhr (mel) in the hybrid irrespectively of the presence of the factor. At last, we showed that Lhr (mel0) slightly improves the viability of hybrid females, which was not realized previously.

Drosophila melanogaster Parkin ubiquitinates peanut and septin1 as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase,17456438,10.1016/j.ibmb.2007.01.007,"Autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP), a common familial form of Parkinson's disease, is caused by mutations of human Parkin. To deepen the understanding of Parkin biology in an in vivo model of Drosophila, we attempted to characterize the function of Drosophila melanogaster Parkin and found that D. melanogaster Parkin exhibited UbcH8-dependent E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. Using E2 binding and in vitro ubiquitination assays, UbcH8 preferentially was found to bind to Parkin mutants harboring functional RING1 domains, but failed to bind to mutants harboring point mutants with complete loss of function. This inability of UbcH8 binding to such mutants was accompanied by abrogation of an E3 ligase activity, indicating that D. melanogaster Parkin as an E3 ligase interacts with UbcH8 through its RING1 domain. An in vivo ubiquitination assay revealed that D. melanogaster Parkin existed in ubiquitinated form in vivo. Moreover, peanut and septin1, D. melanogaster septin proteins, were also ubiquitinated by D. melanogaster Parkin. Co-immunoprecipitation with membrane protein Syntaxin indicated direct binding of septin proteins to syntaxin, implicating their relevance in the exocytosis of dopamine in cells. Western blot analysis and DNA fragmentation indicated that the rate and efficiency of p53-dependent apoptosis were significantly higher in the presence of dopamine than without the septin proteins. Therefore, our findings in the present study demonstrate that Parkin possibly influences septin protein effects on p53-mediated apoptosis, helping to extend the utility of Drosophila as a model system for the study of neurodegeneration.",2007,"Young-Joo Bae, Soon-Ja Kang, Kwang Sook Park"
Mycobacterium marinum infection in Drosophila melanogaster for antimycobacterial activity assessment,23118147,10.1093/jac/dks425,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      The major advantages of Drosophila melanogaster are a well-characterized immune system and high degree of susceptibility to tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium marinum. The D. melanogaster-M. marinum infection model is gaining momentum as a screening tool because it is genetically amenable, low priced, rapid, technically convenient and ethically acceptable. In this context, the aim of this study was to develop a new, effective D. melanogaster-M. marinum in vivo efficacy model for antimycobacterial drug discovery.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      D. melanogaster were challenged with intra-abdominal injections of M. marinum and infected flies were fed with a fly medium containing isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, amikacin, dinitrobenzamide or ampicillin dissolved in DMSO at different concentrations (0, 100 and 500 mg/L). Bacterial dissemination in flies was monitored by fluorescence microscopy/cfu counts and a fly survival curve was plotted.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The D. melanogaster-M. marinum model allowed assessment of the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment not only with conventional drugs, but also with newly discovered antimycobacterial agents. Rifampicin, dinitrobenzamide, amikacin and isoniazid effectively extended the life span of infected flies and ethambutol showed slightly improved survival. However, M. marinum infection was not cured by ampicillin or pyrazinamide.

U85 small CB-specific RNA, U2 small nuclear RNA, the survival of motor neurons protein, and fibrillarin occur together in a nuclear body that is closely associated with the nucleolus. Based on its similarity to CBs in other organisms, we refer to this structure as the D. melanogaster CB. Surprisingly, the D. melanogaster U7 small nuclear RNP resides in a separate nuclear body, which we call the histone locus body (HLB). The HLB is invariably colocalized with the histone gene locus. Thus, canonical CB components are distributed into at least two nuclear bodies in D. melanogaster.

piRNA silencing contributes to interspecies hybrid sterility and reproductive isolation in Drosophila melanogaster,30788506,10.1093/nar/gkz130,"The piRNA pathway is an adaptive mechanism that maintains genome stability by repression of selfish genomic elements. In the male germline of Drosophila melanogaster repression of Stellate genes by piRNAs generated from Supressor of Stellate (Su(Ste)) locus is required for male fertility, but both Su(Ste) piRNAs and their targets are absent in other Drosophila species. We found that D. melanogaster genome contains multiple X-linked non-coding genomic repeats that have sequence similarity to the protein-coding host gene vasa. In the male germline, these vasa-related AT-chX repeats produce abundant piRNAs that are antisense to vasa; however, vasa mRNA escapes silencing due to imperfect complementarity to AT-chX piRNAs. Unexpectedly, we discovered AT-chX piRNAs target vasa of Drosophila mauritiana in the testes of interspecies hybrids. In the majority of hybrid flies, the testes were strongly reduced in size and germline content. A minority of hybrids maintained wild-type array of premeiotic germ cells in the testes, but in them harmful Stellate genes were derepressed due to the absence of Su(Ste) piRNAs, and meiotic failures were observed.

The initial two-to-four hsp70 duplication occurred 10--15 MYA, according to fixed in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes, before the origin and divergence of the melanogaster and five other species subgroups of the melanogaster group. Analysis of more than 30 kb of flanking sequence surrounding the hsp70 gene clusters suggested that this duplication was likely a retrotransposition. For the melanogaster subgroup, Southern hybridization and an hsp70 restriction map confirmed the conserved number (4) and arrangement of hsp70 genes in the seven species other than D. melanogaster. Drosophila melanogaster is unique; tandem duplication and gene conversion at the derived cluster yielded a fifth hsp70 gene. The four D. orena hsp70 genes are highly similar and concertedly evolving. In contrast, the D. mauritiana hsp70 genes are divergent, and many alleles are nonfunctional.

In contrast to the PTP, the mCrC of Drosophila is not permeable to sucrose and appears to be selective for Ca(2+) and H(+). We show (i) that like the PTP, the mCrC is affected by the sense of rotation of F-ATPase, by Bz-423, and by Mg(2+)/ADP; (ii) that expression of human cyclophilin D in mitochondria of Drosophila S2R(+) cells sensitizes the mCrC to Ca(2+) but does not increase its apparent size; and (iii) that purified dimers of D. melanogaster F-ATPase reconstituted into lipid bilayers form 53-pS channels activated by Ca(2+) and thiol oxidants and inhibited by Mg(2+)/γ-imino ATP.

Since Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans share common parasitoid species, their ecology and evolution can hardly be understood without considering parasitoids. After a short review of data available on Drosophila-parasitoid interactions involving D. melanogaster and D. simulans as hosts, we report field and laboratory experiments investigating the ecological role of Leptopilina parasitoids in Drosophila communities of southern France. Seasonal survey of species abundance shows that strong interspecific interactions occur at both tropic levels. D. simulans progressively replaces D. melanogaster in southern areas suggesting competitive displacement. Parasitoids are responsible for very high Drosophila mortality (up to 90% in some fruits). Field data emphasize the importance of selective pressure that parasitoids exert on Drosophila communities. The two Leptopilina parasites (L. heterotoma and L boulardi) have different local abundances, which vary in time, and they also compete for hosts. We show that parasitoids can mediate the coexistence of D. melanogaster and D. simulans in the laboratory, and thus may contribute to their puzzling coexistence in the field. Conversely, hosts exert selective pressures on parasitoids, and development on either D. melanogaster or D. simulans strongly affects fitness of adult wasps in a temperature-dependent fashion. Local variation in host species abundance and diversity could thus account for the genetic differentiation we observed in one parasitoid species. Despite laboratory studies cannot fully explain complex field situations, it is clear that the ecology and evolution of Drosophila populations and communities, especially D. melanogaster and D. simulans, are strongly constrained by parasitoids, which should receive more attention.",2004,"F Fleury, N Ris, R Allemand, P Fouillet, Y Carton, M Boulétreau"
External control of the Drosophila melanogaster egg to imago development period by specific combinations of 3D low-frequency electric and magnetic fields,25259623,10.3109/15368378.2014.959175,"We report that the duration of the egg-to-imago development period of the Drosophila melanogaster, and the imago longevity, are both controllable by combinations of external 3-dimensional (3D) low-frequency electric and magnetic fields (LFEMFs). Both these periods may be reduced or increased by applying an appropriate configuration of external 3D LFEMFs. We report that the longevity of D. melanogaster imagoes correlates with the duration of the egg-to-imago development period of the respective eggs. We infer that metabolic processes in both eggs and imago are either accelerated (resulting in reduced time periods) or slowed down (resulting in increased time periods). We propose that external 3D LFEMFs induce electric currents in live systems as well as mechanical vibrations on sub-cell, whole-cell and cell-group levels. These external fields induce media polarization due to ionic motion and orientation of electric dipoles that could moderate the observed effects. We found that the longevity of D. melanogaster imagoes is affected by action of 3D LFEMFs on the respective eggs in the embryonic development period (EDP). We interpret this effect as resulting from changes in the regulation mechanism of metabolic processes in D. melanogaster eggs, inherited by the resulting imagoes. We also tested separate effects of either 3D electric or 3D magnetic fields, which were significantly weaker.",2016,"Vladimir I Makarov, Igor Khmelinskii"
"Sexual selection, sexual isolation and pheromones in Drosophila melanogaster strains after long-term maintaining on different diets",28419833,10.1016/j.beproc.2017.04.006,"Evolution of reproductive isolation may be a consequence of a variety of signals used in courtship and mate preferences. Pheromones play an important role in both sexual selection and sexual isolation. The abundance of pheromones in Drosophila melanogaster may depend on different environmental factors, including diet. The aim of this study was to ascertain to which degree principal pheromones affect sexual selection in D. melanogaster. We used D. melanogaster strains reared for 14 years on four substrates: standard cornmeal substrate and those containing tomato, banana and carrot. We have previously determined that long-term maintaining of these dietary strains resulted in differences in their cuticular hydrocarbons profile (CHs). In this work, we have tested the level of sexual selection and sexual isolation between aforementioned strains. We found that the high levels of cis-vaccenyl acetate, 7-pentacosene and 7,11-nonacosadiene in the strain reared on a substrate containing carrot affected the individual attractiveness and influenced sexual isolation between flies of this strain and flies reared on a substrate containing banana. Based on these results, long-term different diets, may contribute, to sexual behaviour of D. melanogaster via the effects of principal pheromones.",2017,"Jelena Trajković, Dragana Miličić, Tatjana Savić, Sofija Pavković-Lučić"
Can Drosophila melanogaster represent a model system for the detection of reproductive adverse drug reactions?,19482095,10.1016/j.drudis.2009.05.010,"Once a molecule is identified as a potential drug, the detection of adverse drug reactions is one of the key components of its development and the FDA approval process. We propose using Drosophila melanogaster to screen for reproductive adverse drug reactions in the early stages of drug development. Compared with other non-mammalian models, D. melanogaster has many similarities to the mammalian reproductive system, including putative sex hormones and conserved proteins involved in genitourinary development. Furthermore, the D. melanogaster model would present significant advantages in time efficiency and cost-effectiveness compared with mammalian models.

Promoter analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster gene encoding transcription elongation factor TFIIS,11311940,10.1016/s0167-4781(01)00203-2,"The promoter region of the Drosophila melanogaster TFIIS gene was characterized by transient expression assay. Serial deletion analysis of the promoter region showed that the promoter region between -112 and +113 is required for the efficient expression of the D. melanogaster TFIIS gene. The results also suggest that the DNA fragments between -112 and -54 and between +94 and +113 contain the vital elements for the expression. The importance of these fragments was further substantiated by the findings that the sequences in these fragments of the D. melanogaster TFIIS gene are conserved in the 5'-flanking regions of the Drosophila virilis TFIIS gene. The comparison of the nucleotide sequences in the 5'-flanking region of the D. melanogaster and D. virilis TFIIS genes revealed that the three regions, -85--59, +76-+126, and the vicinity of the transcription initiation site of the D. melanogaster TFIIS gene, are conserved. It is very interesting that the long downstream DNA between +76 and +126 is highly conserved with 90% identities between the two species. The downstream promoter region between +94 and +113 of the D. melanogaster TFIIS gene was further analyzed by transient expression and band mobility shift assays. The results obtained suggest that the region between +94 and +113 is probably recognized by nuclear factors and that the sequence (+98)AGTAAACAACAT(+109) seems to make a great contribution to promoter activity of the D. melanogaster TFIIS gene.",2001,"Y Oh, S Lee, J Yoon, K Han, K Baek"

Reproductive behavior of Drosophila melanogaster and D. nigrospiracula in the field and in the laboratory,3135147,10.1037/0735-7036.102.2.169,"The reproductive behaviors of two species of fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster and D. nigrospiracula, were compared in field and laboratory populations. A number of differences were observed in the behavior of the two species in their natural habitats. D. melanogaster, which was observed on citrus, mates at its feeding site, whereas D. nigrospiracula, which is cactiphilic, mates on a non-resource-based male territory adjacent to its feeding site. In both species large male size is important for reproductive success. However, in D. melanogaster smaller males tended to be excluded from the breeding site and were therefore not among the pool of potential mates to which females were exposed. Sex ratios were biased toward females in both species, but the high frequency of female remating in D. nigrospiracula may have provided more mating opportunities for the males of this species. Field observations differed from laboratory observations, and I discuss the importance of these differences for understanding the evolution of Drosophila mating systems.",1988,T A Markow
Mdr65 decreases toxicity of multiple insecticides in Drosophila melanogaster,28803989,10.1016/j.ibmb.2017.08.002,"ABC transporters are ubiquitous membrane-bound proteins, present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The major function of eukaryotic ABC transporters is to mediate the efflux of a variety of substrates (including xenobiotics) out of cells. ABC transporters have been widely investigated in humans, particularly for their involvement in multidrug resistance (MDR). Considerably less is known about their roles in transport and/or excretion in insects. ABC transporters are only known to function as exporters in insects. Drosophila melanogaster has 56 ABC transporter genes, including eight which are phylogenetically most similar to the human Mdr genes (ABCB1 clade). We investigated the role of ABC transporters in the ABCB1 clade in modulating the susceptibility to insecticides. We took advantage of the GAL4/UAS system in D. melanogaster to knockdown the expression levels of Mdr65, Mdr50, Mdr49 and ABCB6 using transgenic UAS-RNAi lines and conditional driver lines. The most notable effects were increased sensitivities to nine different insecticides by silencing of Mdr65. Furthermore, a null mutation of Mdr65 decreased the malathion, malaoxon and fipronil LC50 values by a factor of 1.9, 2.1 and 3.9, respectively. Altogether, this data demonstrates the critical role of ABC transporters, particularly Mdr65, in altering the toxicity of specific, structurally diverse, insecticides in D. melanogaster.",2017,"Haina Sun, Nicolas Buchon, Jeffrey G Scott"
Paleo-demography of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup: application of the maximum likelihood method,10650839,10.1266/ggs.74.117,"The species divergence times and demographic histories of Drosophila melanogaster and its three sibling species, D. mauritiana, D. simulans, and D. yakuba, were investigated using a maximum likelihood (ML) method. Thirty-nine orthologous loci for these four species were retrieved from DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database. Both autosomal and X-linked loci were used in this study. A significant degree of rate heterogeneity across loci was observed for each pair of species. Most loci have the GC content greater than 50% at the third codon position. The codon usage bias in Drosophila loci is considered to result in the high GC content and the heterogenous rates across loci. The chi-square, G, and Fisher's exact tests indicated that data sets with 11, 23, and 9 pairs of DNA sequences for the comparison of D. melanogaster with D. mauritiana, D. simulans, and D. yakuba, respectively, retain homogeneous rates across loci. We applied the ML method to these data sets to estimate the DNA sequence divergences before and after speciation of each species pair along with their standard deviations. Using 1.6 x 10(-8) as the rate of nucleotide substitutions per silent site per year, our results indicate that the D. melanogaster lineage split from D. yakuba approximately 5.1 +/- 0.8 million years ago (mya), D. mauritiana 2.7 +/- 0.4 mya, and D. simulans 2.3 +/- 0.3 mya. It implies that D. melanogaster became distinct from D. mauritiana and D. simulans at approximately the same time and from D. yakuba no earlier than 10 mya. The effective ancestral population size of D. melanogaster appears to be stable over evolutionary time. Assuming 10 generations per year for Drosophila, the effective population size in the ancestral lineage immediately prior to the time of species divergence is approximately 3 x 10(6), which is close to that estimated for the extant D. melanogaster population.

Subsequent PCR and Southern analysis revealed that gypsy elements had penetrated into the D. hydei cells, suggesting interspecific transmission of the retrovirus. A D. hydei cell line containing gypsy sequences was established and grown in a mixed culture together with the G418-resistant D. hydei cell line DH33, and gypsy was shown to be transmitted from cell to cell. The proportion of cells carrying gypsy increased with time. The rate of gypsy invasion of the lines DH14 and DH33 was 10(-3) and 10(-2) per cell per generation, respectively.

Context-dependent effects of temperature on starvation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster: Mechanisms and ecological implications,30099070,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2018.08.004,"Temperature can modulate the responses of ectotherms to environmental stressors, such as food shortage. Temperature-mediated plasticity in starvation resistance can arise by changes in the amount of energy stored, the speed of energy expenditure, or the threshold energy reserves required for survival. However, few studies have investigated how temperature affects these physiological mechanisms underlying starvation resistance. In this study, we first examined the mechanistic basis of the temperature dependence of starvation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster. We then tested whether the effects of temperature on starvation resistance would depend on diet and developmental stage in this species. We found that exposure to high temperature during starvation significantly reduced the capacity of D. melanogaster to resist starvation. This warming-induced decrease in starvation resistance was mainly caused by faster depletion of body lipids and not by lower threshold lipid content for survival. D. melanogaster exposed to higher temperatures during feeding accumulated more body lipids and thus became more starvation resistant. Such positive effect of high feeding temperature on starvation resistance was pronounced when D. melanogaster consumed carbohydrate-rich diets. D. melanogaster raised as larvae at low temperature (18 °C) had a weaker starvation resistance at adult emergence compared to those raised at higher temperatures (23 and 28 °C). These results demonstrate that the effects of temperature on starvation responses are highly context-dependent in D. melanogaster.",2018,"Taehwan Jang, Kwang Pum Lee"

We investigated the evolution of oviposition preferences in Drosophila melanogaster Meigen and Drosophila simulans Sturtevant by artificially selecting for the preference for 2 natural resources, grape and quince. The main finding of our study is the differential responses of D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Although preferences evolved in the experimental populations of D. melanogaster, responses were not consistent with the selection regimes applied. In contrast, responses in D. simulans were consistent with expectations, demonstrating that this species has selectable genetic variation for the trait. Furthermore, crosses between D. simulans divergent lines showed that the genetic factors involved in grape preference appear to be largely recessive.

Consistent with phenotypic studies, we find less clinal variation in D. simulans than D. melanogaster, particularly for the autosomes. Moreover, we find that clinally varying loci in D. simulans are less stable over multiple years than comparable clines in D. melanogaster. D. simulans shows a significantly weaker pattern of isolation by distance than D. melanogaster and we find evidence for a stronger contribution of migration to D. simulans population genetic structure. While population bottlenecks and migration can plausibly explain the differences in stability of clinal variation between the two species, we also observe a significant enrichment of shared clinal genes, suggesting that the selective forces associated with climate are acting on the same genes and phenotypes in D. simulans and D. melanogaster.",2016,"Heather E Machado, Alan O Bergland, Katherine R O'Brien, Emily L Behrman, Paul S Schmidt, Dmitri A Petrov"
The Genome of Drosophila innubila Reveals Lineage-Specific Patterns of Selection in Immune Genes,30865231,10.1093/molbev/msz059,"Pathogenic microbes can exert extraordinary evolutionary pressure on their hosts. They can spread rapidly and sicken or even kill their host to promote their own proliferation. Because of this strong selective pressure, immune genes are some of the fastest evolving genes across metazoans, as highlighted in mammals and insects. Drosophila melanogaster serves as a powerful model for studying host/pathogen evolution. While Drosophila melanogaster are frequently exposed to various pathogens, little is known about D. melanogaster's ecology, or if they are representative of other Drosophila species in terms of pathogen pressure. Here, we characterize the genome of Drosophila innubila, a mushroom-feeding species highly diverged from D. melanogaster and investigate the evolution of the immune system. We find substantial differences in the rates of evolution of immune pathways between D. innubila and D. melanogaster. Contrasting what was previously found for D. melanogaster, we find little evidence of rapid evolution of the antiviral RNAi genes and high rates of evolution in the Toll pathway. This suggests that, while immune genes tend to be rapidly evolving in most species, the specific genes that are fastest evolving may depend either on the pathogens faced by the host and/or divergence in the basic architecture of the host's immune system.",2019,"Tom Hill, Boryana S Koseva, Robert L Unckless"

Despite most Drosophila mitochondrial carrier genes having human homologs and sharing with them 50% or higher sequence identity, D. melanogaster genes display peculiar differences from their human counterparts: (1) in the fruit fly, many genes encode more transcript isoforms or are duplicated, resulting in the presence of numerous subfamilies in the genome; (2) the expression of the energy-producing genes in D. melanogaster is coordinated from a motif known as Nuclear Respiratory Gene (NRG), a palindromic 8-bp sequence; (3) fruit-fly duplicated genes encoding mitochondrial carriers show a testis-biased expression pattern, probably in order to keep a duplicate copy in the genome.

A cellular Drosophila melanogaster protein with similarity to baculovirus F envelope fusion proteins,15956544,10.1128/JVI.79.13.7979-7989.2005,"Baculovirus F (fusion) proteins are found in the envelopes of budded virions. Recently a Drosophila melanogaster gene (CG4715) that encodes a protein with sequence similarity to baculovirus F proteins was discovered. To examine similarities and differences with baculovirus F proteins, we cloned the D. melanogaster cellular F (Dm-cF) protein gene and analyzed Dm-cF expression and localization. The predicted Dm-cF protein sequence lacks a furin cleavage site, and transiently expressed Dm-cF showed no protein cleavage and no detectable membrane fusion activity. In cell localization studies, transiently expressed Dm-cF was localized to intracellular organelles in D. melanogaster S2 cells, unlike baculovirus F proteins, which localize to cellular plasma membranes. Using reverse transcriptase PCR and Western blot analysis to examine Dm-cF expression in animals, we detected Dm-cF expression in both larval and adult D. melanogaster cells. However, Dm-cF expression was detected only in third instar larvae and adults, suggesting that Dm-cF expression may be developmentally regulated. We also identified genes related to Dm-cF in the genomes of two other Drosophila species, Drosophila yakuba and Drosophila pseudoobscura, and the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. These observations suggest that f genes may be present in the genomes of many insects. Conservation within and between 22 baculovirus and 4 insect F proteins was examined in detail. These studies demonstrate that Dm-cF is expressed in D. melanogaster and suggest that if baculovirus f genes are derived from a host cellular f gene, the function appears to have changed substantially upon adaptation to the baculovirus infection cycle.",2005,"Oliver Lung, Gary W Blissard"
Paternal Grandmother Age Affects the Strength of Wolbachia-Induced Cytoplasmic Incompatibility in Drosophila melanogaster,31690673,10.1128/mBio.01879-19,"Wolbachia are obligate intracellular bacteria that are globally distributed in half of all arthropod species. As the most abundant maternally inherited microbe in animals, Wolbachia manipulate host reproduction via reproductive parasitism strategies, including cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). CI manifests as embryonic death when Wolbachia-modified sperm fertilize uninfected eggs but not maternally infected eggs. Thus, CI can provide a relative fitness advantage to Wolbachia-infected females and drive the infection through a population. In the genetic model Drosophila melanogaster, the Wolbachia strain wMel induces variable CI, making mechanistic studies in D. melanogaster cumbersome. Here, we demonstrate that sons of older paternal D. melanogaster grandmothers induce stronger CI than sons of younger paternal grandmothers, and we term this relationship the ""paternal grandmother age effect"" (PGAE). Moreover, the embryos and adult sons of older D. melanogaster grandmothers have higher Wolbachia densities, correlating with their ability to induce stronger CI. In addition, we report that Wolbachia density positively correlates with female age and decreases after mating, suggesting that females transmit Wolbachia loads that are proportional to their own titers. These findings reveal a transgenerational impact of age on wMel-induced CI, elucidate Wolbachia density dynamics in D. melanogaster, and provide a methodological advance to studies aimed at understanding wMel-induced CI in the D. melanogaster model.IMPORTANCE Unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) results in a postfertilization incompatibility between Wolbachia-infected males and uninfected females. CI contributes to reproductive isolation between closely related species and is used in worldwide vector control programs to drastically lower arboviral vector population sizes or to replace populations that transmit arboviruses with those resistant to transmission. Despite decades of research on the factors that influence CI, penetrance is often variable under controlled laboratory conditions in various arthropods, suggesting that additional variables influence CI strength. Here, we demonstrate that paternal D. melanogaster grandmother age influences the strength of CI induced by their sons. Older D. melanogaster females have higher Wolbachia densities and produce offspring with higher Wolbachia densities that associate with stronger CI. This work reveals a multigenerational impact of age on CI and expands our understanding of host-Wolbachia interactions and the biology of CI induced by the Wolbachia strain infecting the most widely used arthropod model, D. melanogaster.",2019,"Emily M Layton, Jungmin On, Jessamyn I Perlmutter, Seth R Bordenstein, J Dylan Shropshire"

We compared the structure and function of the generalist D. melanogaster with that of specialist D. sechellia, which oviposits exclusively on morinda fruit . Our analyses show that whereas the fruit's headspace was dominated by acids, antennae responded most strongly to hexanoates. D. sechellia exhibited an extraordinarily strong response to methyl hexanoate (MeHex). Behaviorally, D. sechellia was much more attracted to these morinda fruit volatiles than was D. melanogaster. The high sensitivity to MeHex was paralleled by a 2.5x-3 x overrepresentation of MeHex neurons on the antenna and a concordant 2.9 x increase in volume of the corresponding glomerulus as compared to D. melanogaster. In addition, the MeHex neuron exhibited an extreme sensitivity down to femtograms of its ligand.

Utilizing this approach, we reassembled published D. melanogaster population genomic data sets and added unpublished genomes from several sub-Saharan populations. Most notably, we present aligned data from phase 3 of the Drosophila Population Genomics Project (DPGP3), which provides 197 genomes from a single ancestral range population of D. melanogaster (from Zambia).

Drosophila melanogaster as a model for elucidating the pathogenicity of Francisella tularensis,18248629,10.1111/j.1462-5822.2008.01129.x,"Drosophila melanogaster is a widely used model organism for research on innate immunity and serves as an experimental model for infectious diseases. The aetiological agent of the zoonotic disease tularaemia, Francisella tularensis, can be transmitted by ticks and mosquitoes and Drosophila might be a useful, genetically amenable model host to elucidate the interactions between the bacterium and its arthropod vectors. We found that the live vaccine strain of F. tularensis was phagocytosed by Drosophila and multiplied in fly haemocytes in vitro and in vivo. Bacteria injected into flies resided both inside haemocytes and extracellularly in the open circulatory system. A continuous activation of the humoral immune response, i.e. production of antimicrobial peptides under control of the imd/Relish signalling pathway, was observed and it may have contributed to the relative resistance to F. tularensis as flies defective in the imd/Relish pathway died rapidly. Importantly, bacterial strains deficient for genes of the F. tularensis intracellular growth locus or the macrophage growth locus were attenuated in D. melanogaster.

A set of 26 P1 phages from D. melanogaster were successfully hybridized using fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) to the salivary gland chromosomes of both repleta group species. The results show that the Adh region is distributed in D. repleta and D. buzatii over six distant sites of chromosome 3, homologous to chromosomal arm 2L of D. melanogaster (Muller's element B). This observation implies a density of 2.57 fixed breakpoints per Mb in the Adh region and suggests a considerable reorganization of this chromosomal element via the fixation of paracentric inversions. Nevertheless, breakpoint density in the Adh region is three times lower than that estimated for D. repleta chromosome 2, homologous to D. melanogaster 3R (Muller's element E). Differences in the rate of evolution among chromosomal elements are seemingly persistent in the Drosophila genus over long phylogenetic distances.",2000,"J González, E Betrán, M Ashburner, A Ruiz"
Male-killing Spiroplasma naturally infecting Drosophila melanogaster,15926897,10.1111/j.1365-2583.2005.00558.x,"Elucidation of the mechanism of action of selfish genetic elements is difficult outside species with well-defined genetics. Male-killing, the phenomenon whereby inherited bacteria kill male hosts during embryogenesis, is thus uncharacterized in mechanistic terms despite being common and important in insects. We characterized the prevalence, identity and source of the male-killing infection recently discovered in Drosophila melanogaster in Brazil. Male-killing was found to be present in 2.3% of flies from Recife, Brazil, and was uniquely associated with the presence of Spiroplasma infection. The identity of sequences across part of the 16S and across the 16S-23S ITS region indicated that the male-killing infection of D. melanogaster was very closely related to S. poulsonii, the source of the male-killing infection in willistoni group flies also found in South America. The sequences of two further protein-coding genes indicated the D. melanogaster infection to be most closely related to that found in D. nebulosa, from the willistoni group. Our data suggest that the establishment of D. melanogaster in South America was associated with the movement of male-killing bacteria between species.",2005,"H Montenegro, V N Solferini, L B Klaczko, G D D Hurst"
"Molecular evolution between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans: reduced codon bias, faster rates of amino acid substitution, and larger proteins in D. melanogaster",8913769,,"Both natural selection and mutational biases contribute to variation in codon usage bias within Drosophila species. This study addresses the cause of codon bias differences between the sibling species, Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. Under a model of mutation-selection-drift, variation in mutational processes between species predicts greater base composition differences in neutrally evolving regions than in highly biased genes. Variation in selection intensity, however, predicts larger base composition differences in highly biased loci. Greater differences in the G+C content of 34 coding regions than 46 intron sequences between D. melanogaster and D. simulans suggest that D. melanogaster has undergone a reduction in selection intensity for codon bias. Computer simulations suggest at least a fivefold reduction in Nes at silent sites in this lineage. Other classes of molecular change show lineage effects between these species. Rates of amino acid substitution are higher in the D. melanogaster lineage than in D. simulans in 14 genes for which outgroup sequences are available. Surprisingly, protein sizes are larger in D. melanogaster than in D. simulans in the 34 genes compared between the two species. A substantial fraction of silent, replacement, and insertion/deletion mutations in coding regions may be weakly selected in Drosophila.",1996,H Akashi
Apparent absence of transposable elements related to the P elements of D. melanogaster in other species of Drosophila,6087152,10.1038/310330a0,"P elements are transposable elements found in P strain, but usually not in M strain, Drosophila melanogaster, and are responsible for the hybrid dysgenesis that occurs when male D. melanogaster of the P strain mate with females of the M strain (ref. 1 and references therein). Several P elements, which vary in length and genetic effects, have now been cloned. To investigate the evolutionary origin of P elements, we have used a cloned copy of a D. melanogaster P element to look for related sequences in the genomes of six other Drosophila species. We report here that, unlike many other transposable elements found in D. melanogaster, which seem also to be present in other Drosophila species, we have found no sequences closely enough related to P elements to be detected by DNA hybridization in any other Drosophila species. This result supports the hypothesis that P elements have recently invaded D. melanogaster by horizontal transmission.",1984,"J F Brookfield, E Montgomery, C H Langley"
Wanderings of hobo: a transposon in Drosophila melanogaster and its close relatives,15088653,10.1023/b:gene.0000017636.08925.55,"The transposon hobo is present in the genomes of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans (and D. mauritiana and probably D. sechellia, based on Southern blots) as full-size elements and internally deleted copies. The full-size melanogaster, simulans and mauritiana hobo elements are 99.9% identical at the DNA sequence level, and internally deleted copies in these species essentially differ only in having deletions. In addition to these, hobo-related sequences are present and detectable with a hobo probe in all these species. Those in D. melanogaster are 86-94% identical to the canonical hobo, but with many indels. We have sequenced one that appears to be inserted in heterochromatin (GenBank Acc. No. AF520587). It is 87.6% identical to the canonical hobo, but quite fragmented by indels, with remnants of other transposons inserted in and near it, and clearly is defunct. Numerous similar elements are found in the sequenced D. melanogaster genome. It has recently been shown that some are fixed in the euchromatic genome, but it is probable that still more reside in heterochromatic regions not included in the D. melanogaster genome database. They are probably all relics of an earlier introduction of hobo into the ancestral species. There appear to have been a minimum of two introductions of hobo into the melanogaster subgroup, and more likely three, two ancient and one quite recent. The recent introduction of hobo was probably followed by transfers between the extant species (whether 'horizontally' or by infrequent interspecific hybridization).",2004,"Ian A Boussy, Masanobu Itoh"
Physiological and behavioral responses in Drosophila melanogaster to odorants present at different plant maturation stages,27195459,10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.05.027,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster feeds and oviposits on fermented fruit, hence its physiological and behavioral responses are expected to be tuned to odorants abundant during later stages of fruit maturation. We used a population of about two-hundred isogenic lines of D. melanogaster to assay physiological responses (electroantennograms (EAG)) and behavioral correlates (preferences and choice ratio) to odorants found at different stages of fruit maturation. We quantified electrophysiological and behavioral responses of D. melanogaster for the leaf compound β-cyclocitral, as well as responses to odorants mainly associated with later fruit maturation stages. Electrophysiological and behavioral responses were modulated by the odorant dose. For the leaf compound we observed a steep dose-response curve in both EAG and behavioral data and shallower curves for odorants associated with later stages of maturation. Our data show the connection between sensory and behavioral responses and are consistent with the specialization of D. melanogaster on fermented fruit and avoidance of high doses of compounds associated with earlier stages of maturation. Odor preferences were modulated in a non-additive way when flies were presented with two alternative odorants, and combinations of odorants elicited higher responses than single compounds.",2016,"Elisabetta Versace, Anna Eriksson, Federico Rocchi, Irene Castellan, Paola Sgadò, Albrecht Haase"
"Auditory sensitivity, spatial dynamics, and amplitude of courtship song in Drosophila melanogaster",30180716,10.1121/1.5049791,"Acoustic communication is an important component of courtship in Drosophila melanogaster. It takes the form of courtship song produced by males through the unilateral extension and vibration of a wing. Following the paradigm of sender-receiver matching, song content is assumed to match tuning in the auditory system, however, D. melanogaster audition is nonlinear and tuning dependent upon signal amplitude. At low stimulus amplitudes or in the absence of sound the antenna is tuned into song frequency, but as amplitude increases the antenna's resonance is shifted up by hundreds of Hertz. Accurate measurements of song amplitude have been elusive because of the strong dependency of amplitude upon the spatial geometry between sender and receiver. Here, D. melanogaster auditory directional sensitivity and the geometric position between the courting flies are quantified. It is shown that singing occurs primarily from positions resulting in direct stimulation of the female antenna. Using this information, it is established that the majority of song is louder than theoretically predicted and at these sound levels the female antenna should not amplify or be tuned into song. The study implies that Drosophila hearing, and, in particular, its active mechanisms, could function in a broader context than previously surmised.",2018,"Erica L Morley, Thorin Jonsson, Daniel Robert"
Efficacy of Hydroxy-L-proline (HYP) analogs in the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria in Drosophila Melanogaster,29980178,10.1186/s12882-018-0980-8,"Background:
      
    

    
      Substrate reduction therapy with analogs reduces the accumulation of substrates by inhibiting the metabolic pathways involved in their biosynthesis, providing new treatment options for patients with primary hyperoxalurias (PHs) that often progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This research aims to evaluate the inhibition efficacy of Hydroxy-L-proline (HYP) analogs against calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystal formation in the Drosophila Melanogaster (D. Melanogaster) by comparing them with Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6).
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Three stocks of Drosophila Melanogaster (W118, CG3926 RNAi, and Act5C-GAL4/CyO) were utilized. Two stocks (CG3926 RNAi and Act5C-GAL4 /CyO) were crossed to generate the Act5C > dAGXT RNAi recombinant line (F1 generation) of D. Melanogaster which was used to compare the efficacy of Hydroxy-L-proline (HYP) analogs inhibiting CaOx crystal formation with Vitamin B6 as the traditional therapy for primary hyperoxaluria.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Nephrolithiasis model was successfully constructed by downregulating the function of the dAGXT gene in D. Melanogaster (P-Value = 0.0045). Furthermore, the efficacy of Hydroxy-L-proline (HYP) analogs against CaOx crystal formation was demonstrated in vivo using D. Melanogaster model; the results showed that these L-Proline analogs were better in inhibiting stone formation at very low concentrations than Vitamin B6 (IC50 = 0.6 and 1.8% for standard and dietary salt growth medium respectively) compared to N-acetyl-L-Hydroxyproline (IC50 = 0.1% for both standard and dietary salt growth medium) and Baclofen (IC50 = 0.06 and 0.1% for standard and dietary salt growth medium respectively). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) also showed that Hydroxy-L-proline (HYP) analogs were better alternatives for CaOx inhibition at very low concentration especially when both genetics and environmental factors are intertwined (p < 0.0008) for the dietary salt growth medium and (P < 0.063) for standard growth medium.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Addition of Hydroxy-L-Proline analogs to growth medium resulted in the reduction of CaOx crystals formation. These analogs show promise as potential inhibitors for oxalate reduction in Primary Hyperoxaluria.",2018,"Huan Yang, Musa Male, Yang Li, Ning Wang, Chenming Zhao, Shan Jin, Juncheng Hu, Zhiqiang Chen, Zhangqun Ye, Hua Xu"

The wealth of genetic tools at our disposal over the past four decades has enabled discovery of the genetic and molecular bases of circadian rhythmicity. More recently, detailed investigation leading to the anatomical, neurochemical and electrophysiological characterization of the various neuronal subgroups that comprise the circadian machinery has revealed pathways through which these neurons come together to act as a neuronal circuit.

Levels and fluxes in enzymatic antioxidants following gamma irradiation are inadequate to confer radiation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,30032382,10.1007/s11033-018-4270-0,"Ionizing radiation (IR) causes biological effects either by directly damaging the molecules or by generating free radicals. Antioxidant mechanisms are believed to be involved in neutralising free radicals. Levels of antioxidants therefore assume significance in determining the extent of radiation damage. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster) exhibits remarkable IR tolerance compared to mammals. Present study addresses the questions (1) Whether levels of antioxidants are high in radio-tolerant fruit fly D. melanogaster compared to mammals? (2) Does the antioxidant activity enhance adequately enough post-irradiation? We analysed enzymatic antioxidant profiles and their fluxes prior to and 60 min post-irradiation (50 Gy). Enzymatic antioxidants were analysed in all the developmental stages of D. melanogaster as the fruit fly shows dramatic changes in radiation resistance during development. Activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in Drosophila (pre-irradiation) was comparable to that of mammals. Catalase activity was lower than mammals while glutathione peroxidise (DmGPx) activity was significantly higher. Following irradiation SOD showed changes ranging from 1.40 to 1.62 folds only in larval stages. Catalase activity showed positive change of 1.25 folds only in adults. Activity of DmGPx was largely unaffected. Early pupae showed increased (3.67 fold) glutathione S-transferase activity post-irradiation. Non-enzymatic antioxidants such as total antioxidant capacity showed significant whereas reduced glutathione showed insignificant flux. In conclusion, the levels of enzymatic antioxidants in Drosophila compared to IR sensitive mammals and post-irradiation fluxes in antioxidant enzyme levels appear inadequate to explicate the dramatic radiation resistance observed in Drosophila. The observations are in agreement with the recent findings refuting the role of enzymatic antioxidants in radiation resistance.",2018,"Jagdish Gopal Paithankar, Shamprasad Varija Raghu, Rajashekhar K Patil"

No detectable effect of Wolbachia w Mel on the prevalence and abundance of the RNA virome of Drosophila melanogaster,30051873,10.1098/rspb.2018.1165,"Wolbachia is an endosymbiotic bacterium that can block viral infections in arthropods, generating interest in its potential to control the spread of mosquito-borne disease. Drosophila melanogaster is model organism for Wolbachia infection, and the wMel strain of Wolbachia can improve host survival following viral infection. However, it is unclear whether wMel induces anti-viral blocking against the broader native virome of D. melanogaster, or whether the major effect of Wolbachia is a reduction in viral abundance rather than viral clearance. We examined the effect of Wolbachia on viral abundance by comparing the total transcriptome of wMel-positive and wMel-negative D. melanogaster populations sampled from six locations in Australia. In addition, we examined the impact of wMel on individual flies by obtaining transcriptome data from 20 wMel-positive and 20 wMel-negative D. melanogaster from the location (Melbourne) with highest density of wMel. These data revealed high viral abundance in both Wolbachia-positive and -negative populations and individuals. Notably, none of the viral species identified, representing RNA viruses from at least nine families/floating genera, showed evidence of protection by wMel. Although the viral loads of picorna-like viruses are reduced by wMel under experimental conditions, we observed no such effect here. These data show that D. melanogaster can harbour abundant RNA viruses regardless of its Wolbachia status and imply that the interaction between Wolbachia and viruses in nature is more complex than simple blocking.",2018,"Mang Shi, Vanessa L White, Timothy Schlub, John-Sebastian Eden, Ary A Hoffmann, Edward C Holmes"
Penelope retroelements from Drosophila virilis are active after transformation of Drosophila melanogaster,12451171,10.1073/pnas.252641799,"The Penelope family of retroelements was first described in species of the Drosophila virilis group. Intact elements encode a reverse transcriptase and an endonuclease of the UvrC type, which may play a role in Penelope integration. Penelope is a key element in the induction of D. virilis hybrid dysgenesis, which involves the mobilization of several unrelated families of transposable elements. We here report the successful introduction of Penelope into the germ line of Drosophila melanogaster by P element-mediated transformation with three different constructs. Penelope is actively transcribed in the D. melanogaster genome only in lines transformed with a construct containing a full-length Penelope clone. The transcript is identical to that detected in D. virilis dysgenic hybrids. Most newly transposed Penelope elements have a very complex organization. Significant proliferation of Penelope copy number occurred in some lines during the 24-month period after transformation. The absence of copy number increase with two other constructs suggests that the 5' andor 3' UTRs of Penelope are required for successful transposition in D. melanogaster. No insect retroelement has previously been reported to be actively transcribed and to increase in copy number after interspecific transformation.",2002,"Konstantin I Pyatkov, Natalia G Shostak, Elena S Zelentsova, George T Lyozin, Michael I Melekhin, David J Finnegan, Margaret G Kidwell, Michael B Evgen'ev"
Drosophila melanogaster cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes is a lysosomal protein essential for fly development,25173815,10.1016/j.bbamcr.2014.08.012,"Mammalian cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes is a lysosomal glycoprotein implicated in cellular growth and differentiation. The genome of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster encodes a putative orthologue (dCREG), suggesting evolutionarily conserved physiological functions of this protein. In D. melanogaster S2 cells, dCREG was found to localize in lysosomes. Further studies revealed that intracellular dCREG is subject of proteolytic maturation. Processing and turnover could be substantially reduced by RNAi-mediated silencing of cathepsin L. In contrast to mammalian cells, lysosomal delivery of dCREG does not depend on its carbohydrate moiety. Furthermore, depletion of the putative D. melanogaster lysosomal sorting receptor lysosomal enzyme receptor protein did not compromise cellular retention of dCREG. We also investigated the developmental consequences of dCREG ablation in whole D. melanogaster flies. Ubiquitous depletion of dCREG proved lethal at the late pupal stage once a knock-down efficiency of >95% was achieved. These results demonstrate that dCREG is essential for proper completion of fly development.",2014,"Elisabeth Kowalewski-Nimmerfall, Philipp Schähs, Daniel Maresch, Dubravko Rendic, Helmut Krämer, Lukas Mach"
Factors affecting synonymous codon usage of housekeeping genes in Drosophila melanogaster,29575916,10.1556/018.68.2018.1.5,"Housekeeping genes (HK genes) are required for cell survival and the maintenance of basic cellular functions. The investigation of factors affecting codon usage patterns in HK genes of insects can help in understanding the molecular evolution of insects and aid the development of insect pest management strategies. In this study, we employed bioinformatics approaches to analyze the codon usage bias (CUB) of HK genes in the insect model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. A comparison of CUB between 1107 HK genes and 1084 high tissue specificity genes suggested that HK genes have higher CUB in D. melanogaster. In addition, we found that CUB inversely correlates with the non-synonymous substitution rate of HK genes. Therefore, we attempted to identify the factors that potentially influence the codon usage pattern of HK genes. Our results suggest that mutation pressure and natural selection highly correlate with CUB in the HK genes of D. melanogaster and that two topological properties of HK proteins (proportion of protein interacting length and protein connectivity) also correlate with CUB in the HK genes of D. melanogaster. This study provides insight into CUB in the HK genes of D. melanogaster, and the results can support future investigations of potential applications in agricultural and biomedical field.",2018,"Yi Wen Lu, Tai Sheng Chiu"
The role of species-specific sensory cues in male responses to mating rivals in Drosophila melanogaster fruitflies,29187965,10.1002/ece3.3455,"Complex sets of cues can be important in recognizing and responding to conspecific mating competitors and avoiding potentially costly heterospecific competitive interactions. Within Drosophila melanogaster, males can detect sensory inputs from conspecifics to assess the level of competition. They respond to rivals by significantly extending mating duration and gain significant fitness benefits from doing so. Here, we tested the idea that the multiple sensory cues used by D. melanogaster males to detect conspecifics also function to minimize ""off-target"" responses to heterospecific males that they might encounter (Drosophila simulans, Drosophila yakuba, Drosophila pseudoobscura, or Drosophila virilis). Focal D. melanogaster males exposed to D. simulans or D. pseudoobscura subsequently increased mating duration, but to a lesser extent than following exposure to conspecific rivals. The magnitude of rivals' responses expressed by D. melanogaster males did not align with genetic distance between species, and none of the sensory manipulations caused D. melanogaster to respond to males of all other species tested. However, when we removed or provided ""false"" sensory cues, D. melanogaster males became more likely to show increased mating duration responses to heterospecific males. We suggest that benefits of avoiding inaccurate assessment of the competitive environment may shape the evolution of recognition cues.",2017,"Amanda Bretman, James Rouse, James D Westmancoat, Tracey Chapman"

The constitutive heterochromatin of D. melanogaster contains several genetically active domains; this raises the possibility that TE-homologous sequences inserted into functional heterochromatin compartments may be expressed. In this review, I present available data on the genetic and molecular organization of D. melanogaster constitutive heterochromatin and its relationship with transposable elements. The implications of these findings on the possible impact of heterochromatic TEs on the function and evolution of the host genome are also discussed.",1997,P Dimitri

In this paper, through a loss-of-function screen using P-element inserted lines and also by means of expression analyses of larval olfaction candidate genes, we extended the uncovering of the genetic underpinnings of D. melanogaster larval olfactory behavior by demonstrating that larval olfactory behavior is, in addition to Or genes, orchestrated by numerous genes with diverse functions.

Drosophila melanogaster laid over 95% of its eggs in sieved medium (vs. unsieved medium); D. simulans laid all of its eggs in sieved medium. Surgical removal of antennal segments, and of fore-, mid-, or hindtarsi did not affect this result, indicating that sense organs involved in discriminating between sieved and unsieved medium are not confined to only one of the tested structures. In a ""multiple choice"" experiment, females were allowed to lay eggs in sieved medium of three types: unconditioned (fresh) medium, medium conditioned by D. melanogaster larvae (i.e., medium containing larval residues of D. melanogaster), and medium conditioned by D. simulans larvae. This choice experiment was performed with D. melanogaster and with D. simulans, using three densities of females (10, 20, and 40 per experimental unit). Both species laid more eggs in unconditioned medium than in either of the conditioned media, and density had no effect. D. melanogaster laid more eggs near the edges of food patches than in the center, whereas D. simulans showed no preference for edge or center. Under crowded conditions, both species survived at a higher rate in conditioned media (egg-to-adult survival) than in unconditioned medium, leading to the anomalous conclusion that females of these species seem not to maximize the survival of their offspring.

However, a large number of studies have used non natural pathogens as very few natural pathogens have been isolated and identified. Our aim was to isolate and characterize natural pathogen/s of D. melanogaster.

This strain induced substantial mortality (36-62%) in adults of several laboratory populations of D. melanogaster. PK-1 grew rapidly within the body of the flies post infection and both males and females had roughly same number of colony forming units. Mortality was affected by mode of infection and dosage of the pathogen. However mating status of the host had no effect on mortality post infection. Given that there are very few known natural bacterial pathogens of D. melanogaster and that PK-1 can establish a sustained infection across various outbred and inbred populations of D. melanogaster this new isolate is a potential resource for future studies on immunity.",2016,"Karan Singh, Mohammad Zulkifli, N G Prasad"
"The Discovery, Distribution, and Evolution of Viruses Associated with Drosophila melanogaster",26172158,10.1371/journal.pbio.1002210,"Drosophila melanogaster is a valuable invertebrate model for viral infection and antiviral immunity, and is a focus for studies of insect-virus coevolution. Here we use a metagenomic approach to identify more than 20 previously undetected RNA viruses and a DNA virus associated with wild D. melanogaster. These viruses not only include distant relatives of known insect pathogens but also novel groups of insect-infecting viruses. By sequencing virus-derived small RNAs, we show that the viruses represent active infections of Drosophila. We find that the RNA viruses differ in the number and properties of their small RNAs, and we detect both siRNAs and a novel miRNA from the DNA virus. Analysis of small RNAs also allows us to identify putative viral sequences that lack detectable sequence similarity to known viruses. By surveying >2,000 individually collected wild adult Drosophila we show that more than 30% of D. melanogaster carry a detectable virus, and more than 6% carry multiple viruses. However, despite a high prevalence of the Wolbachia endosymbiont--which is known to be protective against virus infections in Drosophila--we were unable to detect any relationship between the presence of Wolbachia and the presence of any virus. Using publicly available RNA-seq datasets, we show that the community of viruses in Drosophila laboratories is very different from that seen in the wild, but that some of the newly discovered viruses are nevertheless widespread in laboratory lines and are ubiquitous in cell culture. By sequencing viruses from individual wild-collected flies we show that some viruses are shared between D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Our results provide an essential evolutionary and ecological context for host-virus interaction in Drosophila, and the newly reported viral sequences will help develop D. melanogaster further as a model for molecular and evolutionary virus research.",2015,"Claire L Webster, Fergal M Waldron, Shaun Robertson, Daisy Crowson, Giada Ferrari, Juan F Quintana, Jean-Michel Brouqui, Elizabeth H Bayne, Ben Longdon, Amy H Buck, Brian P Lazzaro, Jewelna Akorli, Penelope R Haddrill, Darren J Obbard"
Selection against transposable elements in D. simulans and D. melanogaster,8772422,10.1017/s0016672300033838,"The insertion site numbers of the transposable elements (TEs) copia, mdg1, 412 and gypsy were determined in various natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans by in situ hybridization. We showed that, while all elements except gypsy had many insertion sites scattered over the chromosomes in D. melanogaster, only the 412 element in D. simulans presented a high number of insertions, and this number was lower than in D. melanogaster. This low 412 site number per genome in D. simulans was associated with a lower proportion of insertions on the X chromosome in comparison with D. melanogaster, as determined in diploid genomes (0.090 for D. simulans against 0.137 for D. melanogaster) and in haploid genomes (0.102 against 0.146), each value being, moreover, lower than the value of 0.20 expected on the hypothesis of no selection against insertional mutations. These results suggest that selection is a major mechanism explaining 412 copy number regulation in Drosophila, and is stronger in D. simulans than in D. melanogaster.",1996,"C Vieira, C Biémont"
Using Drosophila melanogaster to validate metabolism-based insecticide resistance from insect pests,23023059,10.1016/j.ibmb.2012.09.003,"Identifying molecular mechanisms of insecticide resistance is important for preserving insecticide efficacy, developing new insecticides and implementing insect control. The metabolic detoxification of insecticides is a widespread resistance mechanism. Enzymes with the potential to detoxify insecticides are commonly encoded by members of the large cytochrome P450, glutathione S-transferase and carboxylesterase gene families, all rapidly evolving in insects. Here, we demonstrate that the model insect Drosophila melanogaster is useful for functionally validating the role of metabolic enzymes in conferring metabolism-based insecticide resistance. Alleles of three well-characterized genes from different pest insects were expressed in transgenic D. melanogaster : a carboxylesterase gene (αE7) from the Australian sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina, a glutathione S-transferase gene (GstE2) from the mosquito Anopheles gambiae and a cytochrome P450 gene (Cyp6cm1) from the whitefly Bemisia tabaci. For all genes, expression in D. melanogaster resulted in insecticide resistance phenotypes mirroring those observed in resistant populations of the pest species.

The efficiency of sexual isolation was measured by the frequency of courtship initiation and interspecific mating. We first surveyed the variation in sexual isolation between D. melanogaster strains and D. simulans strains of different geographic origin. Then, to investigate variation in sexual isolation within strains, we made F1 diallel sets of reciprocal crosses within strains of D. melanogaster and D. simulans. The F1 diallel progeny of one sex were paired with the opposite sex of the other species. The first experiment showed significant differences in the frequency of interspecific mating between geographic strains. There were more matings between D. simulans females and D. melanogaster males than between D. melanogaster females and D. simulans males. The second experiment uncovered that the male genotypes in the D. melanogaster diallel significantly differed in interspecific mating frequency, but not in courtship initiation frequency. The female genotypes in the D. simulans diallel were not significantly different in courtship initiation and interspecific mating frequency. Genetic analysis reveals that in D. melanogaster males sexual isolation was not affected by either maternal cytoplasmic effects, sex-linked effects, or epistatic interaction. The main genetic components were directional dominance and overdominance. The F1 males achieved more matings with D. simulans females than the inbred males. The genetic architecture of sexual isolation in D. melanogaster males argues for a history of weak or no selection for lower interspecific mating propensity. The behavioral causes of variation in sexual isolation between the two species are discussed.",1992,"Philip Welbergen, Folchert R van Dijken, Wim Scharloo, Wolfgang Köhler"
Knockdown of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase-like 2 in Drosophila melanogaster,31385627,10.1002/arch.21608,"Drosophila melanogaster produces fatty acid amides, and thus, provides a model to unravel the pathways for their biosynthesis. We previously demonstrated that arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase-like 2 (AANATL2) from D. melanogaster will catalyze the formation of long-chain N-acylserotonins and N-acyldopamines in vitro. Generating silencing RNA via the UAS/GAL4 bipartite approach for targeted gene expression effectively decreased the endogenous levels of the AANATL2 transcripts in D. melanogaster, as shown by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Consistent with these data, western blot analysis of the offspring of the AANATL2 knockdown flies using an anti-AANATL2 antibody revealed a significant reduction in the expression of the AANATL2 protein. Reduced expression of AANATL2 decreased the cellular levels of N-palmitoyldopamine (PALDA), providing strong evidence that AANATL2 is responsible for the biosynthesis of PALDA in vivo. This is the first time that the expression of an AANAT has been reduced in D. melanogaster to link one of these enzymes to the in vivo production of an N-acylarylalkylamide.",2019,"Ryan L Anderson, Dylan J Wallis, Alexander Aguirre, Dean Holliday, David J Merkler"

A portrait of copy-number polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster,18056801,10.1073/pnas.0709888104,"Thomas Hunt Morgan and colleagues identified variation in gene copy number in Drosophila in the 1920s and 1930s and linked such variation to phenotypic differences [Bridges CB (1936) Science 83:210]. Yet the extent of variation in the number of chromosomes, chromosomal regions, or gene copies, and the importance of this variation within species, remain poorly understood. Here, we focus on copy-number variation in Drosophila melanogaster. We characterize copy-number polymorphism (CNP) across genomic regions, and we contrast patterns to infer the evolutionary processes acting on this variation. Copy-number variation in D. melanogaster is nonrandomly distributed, presumably because of a mutational bias produced by tandem repeats or other mechanisms. Comparisons of coding and noncoding CNPs, however, reveal a strong effect of purifying selection in the removal of structural variation from functionally constrained regions. Most patterns of CNP in D. melanogaster suggest that negative selection and mutational biases are the primary agents responsible for shaping structural variation.",2007,"Erik B Dopman, Daniel L Hartl"
"[Functional analysis of Grp and Iris, the gag and env domesticated errantivirus genes, in the Drosophila melanogaster genome]",27414781,10.7868/S0026898416020154,"Drosophila melanogaster is the only invertebrate that contains endogenous retroviruses, which are called errantiviruses. Two domesticated genes, Grp and Iris, which originate from errantivirus gag and env, respectively, have been found in the D. melanogaster genome. The functions performed by the genes in Drosophila are still unclear. To identify the functions of domesticated gag and env in the D. melanogaster genome, expression of Iris and Grp was studied in strains differing by the presence or absence of the functional gypsy errantivirus. In addition, the expression levels were measured after injection of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which activate different immune response pathways, and exposure to various abiotic stress factors. The presence of functional D. melanogaster retrovirus gypsy was found to increase the Grp expression level in somatic tissues of the carcass, while exerting no effect on the Iris expression level. Activation of the immune response in D. melanogaster by bacteria Bacillus cereus increased the Grp expression level and did not affect Iris expression. As for the effects of abiotic stress factors (oxidative stress, starvation, and heat and cold stress), the Grp expression level increased in response to starvation in D. melanogaster females, and the Iris expression level was downregulated in heat shock and oxidative stress. Based on the findings, Grp was assumed to play a direct role in the immune response in D. melanogaster; Iris is not involved in immune responses, but and apparently performs a cell function that is inhibited in stress.",2016,"P A Makhnovskii, I V Kuzmin, L N Nefedova, A I Kima"
Development of a Visualization Method for Imidacloprid in Drosophila melanogaster via Imaging Mass Spectrometry,29962377,10.2116/analsci.18SCP04,"Imidacloprid is widely used for exterminating harmful insects; however, information regarding its distribution in insects is limited. Herein, we developed a visualization method for imidacloprid in Drosophila melanogaster, by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS). IMS requires sample cryosections; however, certain challenges prevail in retaining fly morphology in sections owing to their small size and heterogeneous components. Therefore, the section preparation method was optimized first, followed by imidacloprid distribution visualized using MALDI-IMS. Using 10% gelatin as an embedding material and 70% ethanol for pretreatment, the gaps between embedding material and D. melanogaster body surface were reduced. The tight adhesion between embedding media and D. melanogaster retains fly morphology in sections. Furthermore, the imidacloprid standard was analyzed separately via MALDI and electrospray ionization (ESI), and imidacloprid was converted to guanidine-imidacloprid via laser irradiation. Consequently, the imidacloprid distribution in D. melanogaster was successfully visualized using guanidine-imidacloprid as the target peak.",2018,"Seitaro Ohtsu, Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Hisashi Nishiwaki, Eiichiro Fukusaki, Shuichi Shimma"

In this study we show that several motifs that we have previously identified in the neuralized protein of D. melanogaster are conserved in D. virilis. These include a putative nuclear localization signal, a homeodomain similarity region, and a zinc finger motif. In contrast, a helix-turn-helix motif with structural similarity to those identified as DNA-binding regions of bacterial repressors is deleted.

Identification of glucocorticoid receptor in Drosophila melanogaster,32539689,10.1186/s12866-020-01848-x,"Background:
      
    

    
      Vertebrate glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is an evolutionary-conserved cortisol-regulated nuclear receptor that controls key metabolic and developmental pathways. Upon binding to cortisol, GR acts as an immunosuppressive transcription factor. Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism to study innate immunity, can also be immunosuppressed by glucocorticoids. However, while the genome of fruit fly harbors 18 nuclear receptor genes, the functional homolog of vertebrate GR has not been identified.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In this study, we demonstrated that while D. melanogaster is susceptible to Saccharomyces cerevisiae oral infection, the oral exposure to cortisol analogs, cortisone acetate or estrogen, increases fly sensitivity to yeast challenge. To understand the mechanism of this steroid-induced immunosuppression, we identified the closest genetic GR homolog as D. melanogaster Estrogen Related Receptor (ERR) gene. We discovered that Drosophila ERR is necessary for cortisone acetate- and estrogen-mediated increase in sensitivity to fungal infection: while ERR mutant flies are as sensitive to the fungal challenge as the wildtype flies, the yeast-sensitivity of ERR mutants is not increased by these steroids. Interestingly, the fungal cortisone analog, ergosterol, did not increase the susceptibility of Drosophila to yeast infection. The immunosuppressive effect of steroids on the sensitivity of flies to fungi is evolutionary conserved in insects, as we show that estrogen significantly increases the yeast-sensitivity of Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, whose genome contains a close ortholog of the fly ERR gene.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study identifies a D. melanogaster gene that structurally resembles vertebrate GR and is functionally necessary for the steroid-mediated immunosuppression to fungal infections.",2020,"Gloria Bartolo, Leandra O Gonzalez, Saleem Alameh, C Alexander Valencia, Mikhail Martchenko Shilman"
Negligible Senescence during Reproductive Dormancy in Drosophila melanogaster,18707322,10.1086/321320,"Some endemic Drosophila overwinter in a state of adult reproductive diapause where egg maturation is arrested in previtellogenic stages. When maintained at cool temperatures, adult Drosophila melanogaster enter reproductive dormancy, that is, diapause or diapause-like quiescence. The ability to survive for extended periods is a typical feature of diapause syndromes. In adults this somatic persistence may involve reduced or slowed senescence. Here we assess whether reproductively dormant D. melanogaster age at slow rates. Adults were exposed to dormancy-inducing conditions for 3, 6, or 9 wk. After this period, demographic parameters were measured under normal conditions and compared to the demography of newly eclosed cohorts. The age-specific mortality rates of postdormancy adults were essentially identical to the mortality rates of newly eclosed, young flies. Postdormancy reproduction, in contrast, declined with the duration of the treatment; somatic survival during dormancy may tradeoff with later reproduction. Adults in reproductive dormancy were highly resistant to heat and to oxidative stress. Suppressed synthesis of juvenile hormone is known to regulate reproductive diapause of many insects. Treatment of dormant D. melanogaster with a juvenile hormone analog restored vitellogenesis, suppressed stress resistance, and increased demographic senescence. We conclude that D. melanogaster age at slow rates as part of their reproductive dormancy syndrome; the data do not agree with an alternative hypothesis based on heat-dependent ""rate of living."" We suggest that low temperature reduces neuroendocrine function, which in turn slows senescence as a function of altered stress response, nutrient reallocation, and metabolism.",2001,"M Tatar, S A Chien, N K Priest"

We used the Marey map approach that is based on comparing the genetic and physical maps to infer recombination rates along the major chromosomes of the D.melanogaster genome.

Detection of P element transcripts in embryos of Drosophila melanogaster and D. willistoni,19893894,10.1590/s0001-37652009000400007,"The P element is one of the most thoroughly studied transposable elements (TE). Its mobilization causes the hybrid dysgenesis that was first described in Drosophila melanogaster. While studies of the P element have mainly been done in D. melanogaster, it is believed that Drosophila willistoni was the original host species of this TE and that P was transposed to the D. melanogaster genome by horizontal transfer. Our study sought to compare the transcriptional behavior of the P element in embryos of D. melanogaster, which is a recent host, with embryos of two strains of D. willistoni, a species that has contained the P element for a longer time. In both species, potential transcripts of transposase, the enzyme responsible for the TE mobilization, were detected, as were transcripts of the 66-kDa repressor, truncated and antisense sequences, which can have the ability to prevent TEs mobilization. The truncated transcripts reveal the truncated P elements present in the genome strains and whose number seems to be related to the invasion time of the genome by the TE. No qualitative differences in antisense transcripts were observed among the strains, even in the D. willistoni strain with the highest frequency of heterochromatic P elements.",2009,"Monica L Blauth, Rafaela V Bruno, Eliana Abdelhay, Elgion L S Loreto, Vera L S Valente"
Drosophila melanogaster males respond differently at the behavioural and genome-wide levels to Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans females,19765174,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01834.x,"Drosophila melanogaster are found in sympatry with Drosophila simulans, and matings between the species produce nonfertile hybrid offspring at low frequency. Evolutionary theory predicts that females choose mates, so males should alter their behaviour in response to female cues. We show that D. melanogaster males quickly decrease courtship towards D. simulans females. Courtship levels are reduced within 5 min of exposure to a heterospecific female, and overall courtship is significantly lower than courtship towards conspecific females. To understand changes at the molecular level during mate choice, we performed microarray analysis on D. melanogaster males that courted heterospecific D. simulans females and found nine genes have altered expression compared with controls. In contrast, males that court conspecific females alter expression of at least 35 loci. The changes elicited by conspecific courtship likely modulate nervous system function to reinforce positive conspecific signals and dampen the response to heterospecific signals.",2009,"L L Ellis, G E Carney"
Local thermal adaptation detected during multiple life stages across populations of Drosophila melanogaster,31454449,10.1111/jeb.13530,"Thermal adaptation is typically detected by examining the tolerance of a few populations to extreme temperatures within a single life stage. However, the extent to which adaptation occurs among many different populations might depend on the tolerance of multiple life stages and the average temperature range that the population experiences. Here, we examined local adaptation to native temperature conditions in eleven populations of the well-known cosmopolitan fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. These populations were sampled from across the global range of D. melanogaster. We measured traits related to fitness during each life stage to determine whether certain stages are more sensitive to changes in temperature than others. D. melanogaster appeared to show local adaptation to native temperatures during the egg, larval and adult life stages, but not the pupal stage. This suggests that across the entire distribution of D. melanogaster, certain life stages might be locally adapted to native temperatures, whereas other stages might use phenotypic plasticity or tolerance to a wide range of temperatures experienced in the native environment of this species.",2019,"Christopher J Austin, Amanda J Moehring"
Rescue of hybrid sterility in crosses between D. melanogaster and D. simulans,8600389,10.1038/380157a0,"The genetic analysis of reproductive isolation between species of Drosophila has now reached the resolution necessary to start answering one of the fundamental questions of evolution: what is the genetic basis of species differences?

No doubt he was disappointed to find that the D. melanogaster/D. simulans hybridization resulted only in unisexual sterile hybrids, a disappointment appreciated all the more by modern evolutionary biologists.

"""Cost"" of virginity in wild Drosophila melanogaster females",22393526,10.1002/ece3.54,"Laboratory studies have revealed a significant ""cost of mating"" to Drosophila melanogaster females in the form of reduced longevity. The effect is attributable to nonsperm components of the ejaculate. Female D. melanogaster are known to mate up to six times in nature, and given that they do not typically remate daily, it raises the question as to the extent to which the longevity of wild mated females is reduced. Here I addressed this question by comparing the longevity of wild virgin females, collected as they emerged from rotting fruit, to the longevity of randomly collected mature females at the same site. Because the randomly collected females all were inseminated and were fully pigmented at the time of collection, they already were older than the virgins when the experiment began. Contrary to expectations from laboratory studies, the older, mated females lived significantly longer than the virgins.

Parallel Evolution of Copy-Number Variation across Continents in Drosophila melanogaster,26809315,10.1093/molbev/msw014,"Genetic differentiation across populations that is maintained in the presence of gene flow is a hallmark of spatially varying selection.

As of yet there has been no genome-wide examination of differentiated copy-number variants (CNVs) in these geographic regions, despite their potential importance for phenotypic variation in Drosophila and other taxa. Here, we present an analysis of geographic variation in CNVs in D. melanogaster. We also present the first genomic analysis of geographic variation for copy-number variation in the sister species, D. simulans, in order to investigate patterns of parallel evolution in these close relatives. In D. melanogaster we find hundreds of CNVs, many of which show parallel patterns of geographic variation on both continents, lending support to the idea that they are influenced by spatially varying selection. These findings support the idea that polymorphic CNVs contribute to local adaptation in D. melanogaster In contrast, we find very few CNVs in D. simulans that are geographically differentiated in parallel on both continents, consistent with earlier work suggesting that clinal patterns are weaker in this species.",2016,"Daniel R Schrider, Matthew W Hahn, David J Begun"

The complete sequences of both the 73A and 78C regions were compared to the D. melanogaster genome to determine if the coding region for amylase is present in both regions and to determine the evolutionary mechanism responsible for the observed distribution of the amylase gene or genes. The D. pseudoobscura 73A and 78C linkage groups are conserved with the D. melanogaster 41E and 53CD regions, respectively. The amylase gene, however, has not maintained its conserved linkage between the two species. These data indicate that amylase has moved via a transposition event in the D. melanogaster or D. pseudoobscura lineage.

Molecular variation at the In(2L)t proximal breakpoint site in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans,10747062,,"A previous study of nucleotide polymorphism in a Costa Rican population of Drosophila melanogaster found evidence for a nonneutral deficiency in the number of haplotypes near the proximal breakpoint of In(2L)t, a common inversion polymorphism in this species. Another striking feature of the data was a window of unusually high nucleotide diversity spanning the breakpoint site. To distinguish between selective and neutral demographic explanations for the observed patterns in the data, we sample alleles from three additional populations of D. melanogaster and one population of D. simulans. We find that the strength of associations among sites found at the breakpoint varies between populations of D. melanogaster. In D. simulans, analysis of the homologous region reveals unusually elevated levels of nucleotide polymorphism spanning the breakpoint site. As with American populations of D. melanogaster, our D. simulans sample shows a marked reduction in the number of haplotypes but not in nucleotide diversity. Haplotype tests reveal a significant deficiency in the number of haplotypes relative to the neutral expectation in the D. simulans sample and some populations of D. melanogaster. At the breakpoint site, the level of divergence between haplotype classes is comparable to interspecific divergence. The observation of interspecific polymorphisms that differentiate major haplotype classes in both species suggests that haplotype classes at this locus are considerably old. When considered in the context of other studies on patterns of variation within and between populations of D. melanogaster and D. simulans, our data appear more consistent with the operation of selection than with simple demographic explanations.",2000,"P Andolfatto, M Kreitman"

The Malpighian tubules (MTs) of D. melanogaster are similar to the tubular part of nephron of the human kidney. Besides, it recapitulates the renal toxicity hallmark with mammals when exposed to known nephrotoxicants. In this study, first instar larvae of D. melanogaster (Oregon R) were exposed to different concentrations of two well-known nephrotoxicants, cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg). Akin to higher organisms, Cd and Hg exposure to D. melanogaster produce similar phenotypes. MTs of exposed D. melanogaster larvae exhibited increased oxidative stress, activated cellular antioxidant defense mechanism, GSH depletion, increased cleaved caspase-3 expression, increased DEVDase activity and increased cell death. The functional status of MTs was assessed by fluid secretion rate (FSR), efflux activity of transporter protein, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), ATP level and expression of junctional protein (Dlg). All the phenotypes observed in MTs of D. melanogaster larvae recapitulate the phenotypes observed in higher organisms. Increased uric acid level, the hallmark of renal dysfunction, was also observed in exposed larvae. Taken together, the study suggests that MTs of D. melanogaster may be used as a functional model to evaluate xenobiotic mediated nephrotoxicity.",2020,"Sanjay Saini, Lavi Rani, Neha Shukla, Monisha Banerjee, Debapratim Kar Chowdhuri, Naveen Kumar Gautam"
Patterns of nucleotide diversity at the regions encompassing the Drosophila insulin-like peptide (dilp) genes: demography vs. positive selection in Drosophila melanogaster,23308258,10.1371/journal.pone.0053593,"In Drosophila, the insulin-signaling pathway controls some life history traits, such as fertility and lifespan, and it is considered to be the main metabolic pathway involved in establishing adult body size. Several observations concerning variation in body size in the Drosophila genus are suggestive of its adaptive character. Genes encoding proteins in this pathway are, therefore, good candidates to have experienced adaptive changes and to reveal the footprint of positive selection. The Drosophila insulin-like peptides (DILPs) are the ligands that trigger the insulin-signaling cascade. In Drosophila melanogaster, there are several peptides that are structurally similar to the single mammalian insulin peptide. The footprint of recent adaptive changes on nucleotide variation can be unveiled through the analysis of polymorphism and divergence. With this aim, we have surveyed nucleotide sequence variation at the dilp1-7 genes in a natural population of D. melanogaster. The comparison of polymorphism in D. melanogaster and divergence from D. simulans at different functional classes of the dilp genes provided no evidence of adaptive protein evolution after the split of the D. melanogaster and D. simulans lineages. However, our survey of polymorphism at the dilp gene regions of D. melanogaster has provided some evidence for the action of positive selection at or near these genes. The regions encompassing the dilp1-4 genes and the dilp6 gene stand out as likely affected by recent adaptive events.",2013,"Sara Guirao-Rico, Montserrat Aguadé"
Unusual features of the Drosophila melanogaster telomere transposable element HeT-A are conserved in Drosophila yakuba telomere elements,9520442,10.1073/pnas.95.7.3770,"HeT-A was the first transposable element shown to have a bona fide role in chromosome structure, maintenance of telomeres in Drosophila melanogaster. HeT-A has hallmarks of non-long-terminal-repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposable elements but also has several unique features. We have now isolated HeT-A elements from Drosophila yakuba, showing that the retrotransposon mechanism of telomere maintenance predates the separation of D. melanogaster and D. yakuba (5-15 million years ago). HeT-A elements from the two species show significant sequence divergence, yet unusual features seen in HeT-Amel are conserved in HeT-Ayak. In both species, HeT-A elements are found in head-to-tail tandem arrays in telomeric heterochromatin. In both species, nearly half of the HeT-A sequence is noncoding and shows a distinctive imperfect repeat pattern of A-rich segments. Neither element encodes reverse transcriptase. The HeT-Amel promoter appears to be intermediate between the promoters of non-LTR and of LTR retrotransposons. The HeT-Ayak promoter shows similar features. HeT-Amel has a frameshift within the coding region. HeT-Ayak does not require a frameshift but shows conservation of the polypeptide sequence of the frameshifted product of D. melanogaster.",1998,"O N Danilevskaya, C Tan, J Wong, M Alibhai, M L Pardue"

D. erecta and D. sechellia are specialist species, with host plant Pandanus candelabrum (Pandanaceae) and Morinda citrifolia (Rubiaceae), respectively. The temperature optima were around 57-60℃ for the three species. The pH optima were 7.2 for D. melanogaster, 8.2 for D. erecta and 8.5 for D. sechellia. The kcat and Km were also estimated for each species with different substrates. The specialist species D. erecta and D. sechellia display a higher affinity for starch than D. melanogaster. α-Amylase activity is higher on starch than on glycogen in all species. α-Amylases of D. erecta and D. sechellia have a higher activity on maltooligosaccharides (G6 and G7) than on starch, contrary to D. melanogaster.

However, functional homologues have not been found in insects, despite their common early evolutionary history. Here, we describe the identification and functional characterization of two sbRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster, termed Dm1 and Dm2. The genes coding for these two RNAs were identified by a computational search in the genome of D. melanogaster for conserved sequence motifs present in nematode sbRNAs. The predicted secondary structures of Dm1 and Dm2 partially resemble nematode sbRNAs and show stability in molecular dynamics simulations. Both RNAs are phylogenetically closer related to nematode sbRNAs than to vertebrate Y RNAs. Dm1, but not Dm2 sbRNA is abundantly expressed in D. melanogaster S2 cells and adult flies. Only Dm1, but not Dm2 sbRNA can functionally replace Y RNAs in a human cell-free DNA replication initiation system.

While European and American D. melanogaster populations showed very low differentiation, Asian D. melanogaster populations were highly structured.

We describe specific improvements to the lepidopteran transposon piggyBac and the P element that enabled us to tag and disrupt genes in D. melanogaster more efficiently. We generated over 29,000 inserts resulting in 53% gene saturation and a more diverse collection of phenotypically stronger insertional alleles. We found that piggyBac has distinct global and local gene-tagging behavior from that of P elements.

A comparative study of male meiosis in Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis,2124574,10.1007/BF00226447,"Male meiosis in D. melanogaster cytologically follows the usual pattern, whereas in D. melanogaster and in D. virilis oocytes the chromosomes clump into a karyosphere at early meiotic prophase and remain so up to metaphase I. Male meiosis in D. virilis spermatocytes has an intermediate character: a part of the chromatin clumps together in a karyosphere at early prophase, whereas the other part of the chromatin remains diffuse all through prophase. At the end of prophase, the diffuse chromatin becomes integrated into the karyosphere before metaphase I. During the meiotic divisions the chromosomes have the same clumped aspect as those in Drosophila oocytes and thus differ strikingly from the dividing chromosomes in D. melanogaster spermatocytes. In D. virilis spermatocytes the nucleolus exhibits changes during the meiotic prophase that may be related to synthetical activities.

Visuomotor strategies for object approach and aversion in Drosophila melanogaster,30559298,10.1242/jeb.193730,"Animals classify stimuli to generate appropriate motor actions. In flight, Drosophila melanogaster classify equidistant large and small objects with categorically different behaviors: a tall object evokes approach whereas a small object elicits avoidance. We studied visuomotor behavior in rigidly and magnetically tethered D. melanogaster to reveal strategies that generate aversion to a small object. We discovered that small-object aversion in tethered flight is enabled by aversive saccades and smooth movement, which vary with the stimulus type. Aversive saccades in response to a short bar had different dynamics from approach saccades in response to a tall bar and the distribution of pre-saccade error angles was more stochastic for a short bar. Taken together, we show that aversive responses in D. melanogaster are driven in part by processes that elicit signed saccades with distinct dynamics and trigger mechanisms.

A prokaryotic dnaA sequence in Drosophila melanogaster: Wolbachia infection and cytoplasmic incompatibility among laboratory strains,7894745,10.1111/j.1365-2583.1994.tb00160.x,"Using oligonucleotide primers derived from the aligned polypeptide sequences of several prokaryotic dnaA genes, we amplified from Drosophila melanogaster DNA a 557 bp fragment containing a single open reading frame. The predicted peptide sequence shows a significant similarity to previously characterized protein sequences that are encoded by the dnaA genes of several prokaryotes. The dnaA sequences are also detectable by PCR in DNA from Drosophila simulans and Nasonia vitripennis flies which are infected by a symbiotic bacterium assigned to the type species Wolbachia pipientis. A tetracycline treatment that eradicates bacterial parasites from insects, abolishes the dnaA sequences from Drosophila and Nasonia DNA. In addition, dnaA-positive Drosophila melanogaster contain numerous rod-shaped bacteria in embryos, which are abolished in subsequent generations after treatment with tetracycline. Combined with phylogenetic analysis of DnaA and 16S rRNA sequences, these results show that the dnaA cognate comes from Wolbachia. A survey of Drosophila stocks using PCR amplification of dnaA and 16S rRNA sequences showed that Wolbachia is widely spread among D. melanogaster laboratory strains but absent from several established strains of the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata. Evidence is also presented that presence of the bacterium can cause partial cytoplasmic incompatibility between infected and non-infected D. melanogaster strains.",1994,"K Bourtzis, A Nirgianaki, P Onyango, C Savakis"
Alcohol tolerance: An ecological parameter in the relative success of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,28307067,10.1007/BF00345738,"Laboratory experiments have shown D. melanogaster adults to be more tolerant to alcohol in the environment than D. simulans, with the females being more tolerant than the males of their species. Larval development on alcohol supplemented media also demonstrated an increased tolerance by D. melanogaster although the effect was not as clear cut as for the adult survival. Oviposition choice experiments demonstrated a marked rejection of alcohol impregnated laying sites by D. simulans when compared to standard medium sites. D. melanogaster showed a slight preference for alcohol supplemented sites.Collections in the maturation cellar of a vineyard produced, with the exception of a single D. simulans fly, entirely D. melanogaster adults while larvae and pupae from the cellar were also all D. melanogaster. Away from the alcohol resource, outside the cellar, both species were collected with D. simulans being the more common. However, the outside distribution of the two species was affected by alcohol fumes during vintage, as was the distribution of the sexes of D. melanogaster, with the more tolerant species or sex being closer to the source.

Identification and interaction of multiple genes resulting in DDT resistance in the 91-R strain of Drosophila melanogaster by RNAi approaches,30704719,10.1016/j.pestbp.2018.03.003,"4,4'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) has been re-recommended by the World Health Organization for malaria mosquito control. Previous DDT use has resulted in resistance, and with continued use resistance will likely increase in terms of level and extent. Drosophila melanogaster is a model dipteran with a well annotated genome allowing both forward and reverse genetic manipulation, numerous studies done on insecticide resistance mechanisms, and is related to malaria mosquitoes allowing for extrapolation. The 91-R strain of D. melanogaster is highly resistant to DDT (>1500-fold) and recently, reduced penetration, increased detoxification, and direct excretion have been identified as resistance mechanisms. Their interactions, however, remain unclear. Use of Gal4/UAS-RNAi transgenic lines of D. melanogaster allowed for the targeted knockdown of genes putatively involved in DDT resistance and has identified the role of several cuticular proteins (Cyp4g1 and Lcp1), cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (Cyp6g1 and Cyp12d1), and ATP binding cassette transporters (Mdr50, Mdr65, and Mrp1) involved in decreased sensitivity to DDT.

Synonymous codon usage in Drosophila melanogaster: natural selection and translational accuracy,8005445,,"I present evidence that natural selection biases synonymous codon usage to enhance the accuracy of protein synthesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Since the fitness cost of a translational misincorporation will depend on how the amino acid substitution affects protein function, selection for translational accuracy predicts an association between codon usage in DNA and functional constraint at the protein level. The frequency of preferred codons is significantly higher at codons conserved for amino acids than at nonconserved codons in 38 genes compared between D. melanogaster and Drosophila virilis or Drosophila pseudoobscura (Z = 5.93, P < 10(-6)). Preferred codon usage is also significantly higher in putative zinc-finger and homeodomain regions than in the rest of 28 D. melanogaster transcription factor encoding genes (Z = 8.38, P < 10(-6)).

Drosophila melanogaster is susceptible to Vibrio cholerae infection,16404157,,"Infection of Drosophila melanogaster adults with 6 Vibrio species revealed that V. cholerae was lethal (100% mortality) within 20 h as a result of systemic infection. Avirulent infection by V. vulnificus restricted the subsequent virulent infection by V. cholerae. The immediate transcription of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), most notably Attacin A, was delayed in V. cholerae infection compared to V. vulnificus infection. Ectopic expression of Attacin A and Metchnikowin enhanced the survival of D. melanogaster upon V. cholerae infection. These results suggest that AMPs are important in the response to infections by Vibrio species and that the signaling pathways governing their expression may be targeted by V. cholerae virulence factors to elude the innate immunity of Drosophila.",2005,"Shin-Young Park, Yun-Jeong Heo, Kun-Soo Kim, You-Hee Cho"

In the wild, Drosophila flies aggregate on decaying fruit where they mate and oviposit and a strategy to find mates would be to locate fruit which has already been colonized by other flies. We therefore developed a bioassay to investigate attraction of males to food and fly odours. We showed that upwind flights are initiated by food odours. At shorter distances, males are attracted by volatiles produced by conspecifics. However, only odours produced by copulating flies attract males. This suggests either a synergistic effect of both male and female odours or changes in pheromone release during mating, that indicate the presence of sexually receptive females.

Effects of the synthetic estrogen 17-α-ethinylestradiol on Drosophila melanogaster: Dose and gender dependence,30036827,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.07.020,"17-a-ethinylestradiol (EE2) belongs to the increasing list of Endocrine Disruptors Chemicals (EDCs), able to interfere with the endocrine system in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Regardless of its great dispersion in the environment, to date there is still little knowledge about its action mechanisms and harmful effects in invertebrates. To better evaluate its potential role in invertebrates, we used the model system Drosophila melanogaster, an insect in which the hormonal response has been widely described. The effects of EE2 in D.melanogaster adults have been evaluated by using life traits as well as molecular endpoints. It was found that EE2 significantly decreases survival and fertility in both sexes, with a higher effect in female flies, as well as affects the expression of the Ecdysone Receptor (EcR), Estrogen Related Receptor (ERR), Yolk protein2 (Yp2) and yolkless (yl) genes. In conclusion, our results suggest that EE2 treatment may have potential toxic and endocrine effects on Drosophila melanogaster adults of both sexes. In particular, our data provide an indication that, after EE2 treatment, two of the genes involved in the vitellogenesis process (yl and Yp2) are transcribed in adult males where are mostly silent, and suggest future studies forward their use as potential molecular markers to EDCs exposure in Drosophila male.",2018,"Tiziana Francesca Bovier, Sergio Rossi, Damiano Gustavo Mita, Filomena Anna Digilio"

Molecular and Functional Evolution at the Odorant Receptor Or22 Locus in Drosophila melanogaster,30768139,10.1093/molbev/msz018,"Insect odorant receptor (Or) genes determine the responses of sensory neurons that mediate critical behaviors. The Drosophila melanogaster Or22 locus represents an interesting example of molecular evolution, with high levels of sequence divergence and copy number variation between D. melanogaster and other Drosophila species, and a corresponding high level of variability in the responses of the neuron it controls, ab3A. However, the link between Or22 molecular and functional diversity has not been established. Here, we show that several naturally occurring Or22 variants generate major shifts in neuronal response properties. We determine the molecular changes that underpin these response shifts, one of which represents a chimeric gene variant previously suggested to be under natural selection. In addition, we show that several alternative molecular genetic mechanisms have evolved for ensuring that where there is more than one gene copy at this locus, only one functional receptor is generated. Our data thus provide a causal link between the striking levels of phenotypic neuronal response variation found in natural populations of D. melanogaster and genetic variation at the Or22 locus. Since neuronal responses govern animal behavior, we predict that Or22 may be a key player in underlying one or more olfactory-driven behaviors of significant adaptive importance.",2019,"Katherine H Shaw, Travis K Johnson, Alisha Anderson, Marien de Bruyne, Coral G Warr"
Interactions between Drosophila and its natural yeast symbionts-Is Saccharomyces cerevisiae a good model for studying the fly-yeast relationship?,26336636,10.7717/peerj.1116,"Yeasts play an important role in the biology of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. In addition to being a valuable source of nutrition, yeasts affect D. melanogaster behavior and interact with the host immune system. Most experiments investigating the role of yeasts in D. melanogaster biology use the baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, S. cerevisiae is rarely found with natural populations of D. melanogaster or other Drosophila species. Moreover, the strain of S. cerevisiae used most often in D. melanogaster experiments is a commercially and industrially important strain that, to the best of our knowledge, was not isolated from flies. Since disrupting natural host-microbe interactions can have profound effects on host biology, the results from D. melanogaster-S. cerevisiae laboratory experiments may not be fully representative of host-microbe interactions in nature. In this study, we explore the D. melanogaster-yeast relationship using five different strains of yeast that were isolated from wild Drosophila populations. Ingested live yeasts have variable persistence in the D. melanogaster gastrointestinal tract. For example, Hanseniaspora occidentalis persists relative to S. cerevisiae, while Brettanomyces naardenensis is removed. Despite these differences in persistence relative to S. cerevisiae, we find that all yeasts decrease in total abundance over time. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are an important component of the D. melanogaster anti-microbial response and can inhibit S. cerevisiae growth in the intestine. To determine if sensitivity to ROS explains the differences in yeast persistence, we measured yeast growth in the presence and absence of hydrogen peroxide. We find that B. naardenesis is completely inhibited by hydrogen peroxide, while H. occidentalis is not, which is consistent with yeast sensitivity to ROS affecting persistence within the D. melanogaster gastrointestinal tract. We also compared the feeding preference of D. melanogaster when given the choice between a naturally associated yeast and S. cerevisiae. We do not find a correlation between preferred yeasts and those that persist in the intestine. Notably, in no instances is S. cerevisiae preferred over the naturally associated strains. Overall, our results show that D. melanogaster-yeast interactions are more complex than might be revealed in experiments that use only S. cerevisiae. We propose that future research utilize other yeasts, and especially those that are naturally associated with Drosophila, to more fully understand the role of yeasts in Drosophila biology. Since the genetic basis of host-microbe interactions is shared across taxa and since many of these genes are initially discovered in D. melanogaster, a more realistic fly-yeast model system will benefit our understanding of host-microbe interactions throughout the animal kingdom.",2015,"Don Hoang, Artyom Kopp, James Angus Chandler"
Mutation and evolution of microsatellites in Drosophila melanogaster,9720288,,"Levels of nucleotide polymorphism in the Drosophila melanogaster genome are correlated with rates of recombination. This relationship may be due to hitchhiking of advantageous mutations (selective sweeps) or to continual removal of deleterious mutations from the genome (background selection). One test of the relative contributions of selective sweeps and background selection to the observed levels of variation in the genome of D. melanogaster is to compare levels of nucleotide variability (with a mutation rate on the order of 10(-9) per nucleotide per generation) with more rapidly evolving DNA loci such as microsatellites. This test depends critically on details of the mutational process of microsatellites. In this paper, we summarize our studies of microsatellite characteristics and mutation rates in D. melanogaster. We find that D. melanogaster microsatellites are short and have a mutation rate (6.5 x 10(-6) per locus per generation) several orders of magnitude lower than mammals studied to date. We further show that genetic variation at 18 dinucleotide repeat microsatellites in a population of D. melanogaster from Maryland is correlated with regional rates of recombination. These and other microsatellite data suggest that both background selection and selective sweeps may contribute to the correlation between DNA sequence variation and recombination in Drosophila.",1998,"M D Schug, C M Hutter, M A Noor, C F Aquadro"

We found that diapause in D. melanogaster is inherited as a simple autosomal recessive trait with the C response (less flies in diapause) completely dominant to the W one. Maternal and cytoplasmic factors did not affect differences in diapause in these lines.

Only one esterase of Drosophila melanogaster is likely to degrade juvenile hormone in vivo,17517331,10.1016/j.ibmb.2007.02.010,"Previously we identified juvenile hormone esterase (JHE) from Drosophila melanogaster by the criteria that it showed both appropriate developmental expression and kinetics for juvenile hormone (JH). We also noted three further esterases of D. melanogaster with some JHE-like characteristics, such as a GQSAG active site motif, a particular amphipathic helix, or close phylogenetic relationship with other JHEs. In this study, these JHE-like enzymes were expressed in vitro and their kinetic parameters compared with those of the previously identified JHE. Despite considerable phylogenetic distance between some of the esterases, they could all hydrolyse racemic JHIII. However, only the previously identified JHE had kinetic parameters (K(M) and k(cat)) towards various forms of JH (racemic or individual isomers of JHIII, JHII, JHI, and methyl farnesoate) consistent with a physiological role in JH regulation. Furthermore, only this JHE showed a preference for artificial substrates with acyl chain lengths similar to that of JH. This suggests that there is probably only one physiologically functional JHE in D. melanogaster but multiple esterases with JH esterase activity.

In some populations, resistance has evolved to multiple pesticides. In Drosophila melanogaster, resistance to multiple classes of insecticide is due to the overexpression of a single cytochrome P450 gene, Cyp6g1. Overexpression of Cyp6g1 appears to have evolved in parallel in Drosophila simulans, a sibling species of D. melanogaster, where it is also associated with insecticide resistance. However, it is not known whether the ability of the CYP6G1 enzyme to provide resistance to multiple insecticides evolved recently in D. melanogaster or if this function is present in all Drosophila species. Here we show that duplication of the Cyp6g1 gene occurred at least four times during the evolution of different Drosophila species, and the ability of CYP6G1 to confer resistance to multiple insecticides exists in D. melanogaster and D. simulans but not in Drosophila willistoni or Drosophila virilis. In D. virilis, which has multiple copies of Cyp6g1, one copy confers resistance to DDT and another to nitenpyram, suggesting that the divergence of protein sequence between copies subsequent to the duplication affected the activity of the enzyme. All orthologs tested conferred resistance to one or more insecticides, suggesting that CYP6G1 had the capacity to provide resistance to anthropogenic chemicals before they existed. Finally, we show that expression of Cyp6g1 in the Malpighian tubules, which contributes to DDT resistance in D. melanogaster, is specific to the D. melanogaster-D. simulans lineage. Our results suggest that a combination of gene duplication, regulatory changes and protein coding changes has taken place at the Cyp6g1 locus during evolution and this locus may play a role in providing resistance to different environmental toxins in different Drosophila species.",2014,"Thomas W R Harrop, Tamar Sztal, Christopher Lumb, Robert T Good, Phillip J Daborn, Philip Batterham, Henry Chung"
Polymorphism and divergence at the prune locus in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans,8078405,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040145,"The prune locus of Drosophila melanogaster lies at the tip of the X chromosome, in a region of reduced recombination in which nearby loci show reduced variation relative to evolutionary divergence from D. simulans. DNA sequencing of prune alleles from D. melanogaster and D. simulans reveals extremely low variation in D. melanogaster but greater variation in D. simulans. Divergence between the two species is not reduced. This pattern may be explained by either positive selection leading to hitchhiking of neutral variation or background selection against deleterious mutations. The pattern of silent versus replacement polymorphism and divergence at prune is consistent with either a model of weakly deleterious selection against amino acid substitutions or balancing selection.",1994,"G M Simmons, W Kwok, P Matulonis, T Venkatesh"
External control of the Drosophila melanogaster lifespan by combination of 3D oscillating low-frequency electric and magnetic fields,23977947,10.3109/15368378.2013.817335,We demonstrate that the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster population is controllable by a combination of external three-dimensional oscillating low-frequency electric and magnetic fields (3D OLFEMFs). The lifespan was decreased or increased in dependence of the parameters of the external 3D OLFEMFs. We propose that metabolic processes in D. melanogaster's body are either accelerated (in the case of reduced lifespan) or slowed down (in the case of increased lifespan) in function of 3D OLFEMFs that induce vibrational motions on sub-cellular and larger scales.,2014,"Vladimir I Makarov, Igor Khmelinskii"
"High level of divergence of male-reproductive-tract proteins, between Drosophila melanogaster and its sibling species, D. simulans",3130539,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040484,"We compared male-reproductive-tract polypeptides of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Approximately 64% of male-reproductive-tract polypeptides were identical between two randomly chosen isofemale lines from these two species, compared with 83% identity for third-instar imaginal wing-disc polypeptides. Qualitatively similar differences were found between reproductive tracts and imaginal discs when D. sechellia was compared with D. melanogaster and with D. simulans. When genic polymorphism was taken into account, approximately 10% of male-reproductive-tract polypeptides were apparently fixed for different alleles between D. melanogaster and D. simulans; this proportion is the same as that found for soluble enzymes by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Strikingly, approximately 20% of male-reproductive-tract polypeptides of either D. melanogaster or D. simulans had no detectable homologue in the other species. We propose that proteins of the Drosophila male reproductive tract may have diverged more extensively between species than have other types of proteins and that much of this divergence may involve large changes in levels of polypeptide expression.",1988,"M B Coulthart, R S Singh"
Low concentrations of monosodium glutamate (MSG) are safe in male Drosophila melanogaster,30223880,10.1186/s13104-018-3775-x,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Monosodium glutamate (MSG) has been marred by a lot of controversy on its safety. In a majority of experimental studies, administration of the compound has been parenteral, and yet little is known about MSG safety consumed as a food supplement. In this study, we assessed the effects of low concentrations of MSG on the activity of hydrogen scavenging, catalase activity and climbing as well as lifespan in male Drosophila melanogaster over a 30 days period since this has been sparsely studied.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      No significant differences were associated with MSG at 5%, 1%, 0.2%, 0.04% on hydrogen peroxide scavenging, negative geotaxis and lifespan in W1118 male D. melanogaster. Significant differences were found in 5% MSG on catalase activity, showing that high MSG concentrations would affect tissue health in male D. melanogaster.

Structural homology between Drosophila melanogaster and Escherichia coli acidic ribosomal proteins,6437387,10.1007/BF00485858,"Antibodies raised against Drosophila melanogaster ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) were used to examine possible structural relationships between eukaryotic and prokaryotic r-proteins. The antisera were raised against either groups of r-proteins or individually purified r-proteins. Two antisera showed a cross-reaction with total Escherichia coli r-proteins in Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion assays: an antiserum against the D. melanogaster small subunit protein S14 (anti-S14) and an antiserum against a group of D. melanogaster r-proteins (anti-TP80). The specificity of the antisera and the identity of the homologous E. coli r-proteins were characterized by using immunooverlay and immunoblot assays. These assays indicated that anti-S14 was highly specific for protein S14 and anti-TP80 was a multispecific serum that recognized several of the D. melanogaster ribosomal proteins. The E. coli protein homologous to D. melanogaster protein S14 was identified as E. coli protein S6. By adsorption of the anti-TP80 serum, we determined that D. melanogaster protein 7/8 is homologous to the acidic E. coli protein L7/L12. D. melanogaster acidic protein 13 was also shown to be immunologically related to D. melanogaster protein 7/8.",1984,"W Y Chooi, L M Sabatini, M Macklin"
"Monophyly of Wolbachia pipientis genomes within Drosophila melanogaster: geographic structuring, titre variation and host effects across five populations",24118111,10.1111/mec.12530,"Wolbachia pipientis is one of the most widely studied endosymbionts today, yet we know little about its short-term adaptation and evolution. Here, using a set of 91 inbred Drosophila melanogaster lines from five populations, we explore patterns of diversity and recent evolution in the Wolbachia strain wMel. Within the D. melanogaster lines, we identify six major mitochondrial clades and four wMel clades. Concordant with past studies, the Wolbachia haplotypes contain an overall low level of nucleotide diversity, yet they still display geographic structuring. Using Bayesian analysis informed with demographic estimates of colonization times, we estimate that all extant D. melanogaster mitochondrial haplotypes coalesce to a Wolbachia-infected ancestor approximately 2200 years ago. Finally, we measure wMel titre within the infected flies and find that titre varies across populations, an effect attributable to host genetic factors. This demonstration of local phenotypic divergence suggests that intraspecific host genetic variation plays a key role in shaping this model symbiotic system.",2013,"Angela M Early, Andrew G Clark"
Non-Nutritive Polyol Sweeteners Differ in Insecticidal Activity When Ingested by Adult Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae),27271968,10.1093/jisesa/iew031,"Previous work showed the non-nutritive polyol sweetener Erythritol was toxic when ingested by Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen, 1930). This study assessed whether insect toxicity is a general property of polyols. Among tested compounds, toxicity was highest for erythritol. Adult fruit flies (D. melanogaster) fed erythritol had reduced longevity relative to controls. Other polyols did not reduce longevity; the only exception was a weaker but significant reduction of female (but not male) longevity when flies were fed D-mannitol. We conclude at least some non-nutritive polyols are not toxic to adult D. melanogaster when ingested for 17 days. The longer time course (relative to erythritol) and female specificity of D-mannitol mortality suggests different mechanisms for D-mannitol and erythritol toxicity to D. melanogaster.",2016,"Sean O'Donnell, Kaitlin Baudier, Daniel R Marenda"
Isolation and characterization of Drosophila melanogaster U2 small nuclear RNA genes,6195341,10.1016/s0022-2836(83)80165-x,We describe here the organization of DNA sequences complementary to Drosophila melanogaster U2 small nuclear (sn) RNA. From a genomic library we isolated two recombinants containing two genes each. Genomic reconstruction experiments and Southern analysis revealed that D. melanogaster possesses only four to five U2 snRNA genes or very closely related sequences. The nucleotide sequence of one of the clones analysed shows 77% homology with rat U2 snRNA. A stretch of 12 nucleotides that has been implicated in heterogeneous nuclear RNA splicing is conserved between rat and Drosophila. The genomic organization of these genes is very similar in different melanogaster strains but diverges highly in different Drosophila species.,1983,"A Alonso, J L Jorcano, E Beck, E Spiess"
Drosophila melanogaster Response to Feeding with Neomycin-Based Medium Expressed in Fluctuating Asymmetry,32570778,10.3390/insects11060378,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a model species used for a wide range of studies. Contamination of Drosophila cultures with bacterial infection is common and is readily eradicated by antibiotics. Neomycin antibiotics can cause stress to D. melanogaster's larvae and imagoes, which may affect the interpretation of the results of research using culture from neomycin-based medium. In the present study, fluctuating asymmetry (FA), one of the important bioindicators of stress, was measured. Larvae and imagoes of a wild-type D. melanogaster strain were exposed to various concentrations of neomycin. The size of anal papillae and selected wing veins were measured using scanning electron and light microscopy, respectively. Next, the FA was checked. The values obtained for larval anal papillae appeared to be concentration-dependant; the FA indices increased with the concentration of neomycin. The wing FA presented a large but variable correlation, depending on the measured vein. However, the mean length of veins was the highest for the control group, with neomycin-exposed groups showing lower values. The research showed that neomycin may cause sublethal stress in D. melanogaster, which manifests in increased FA indices. This suggests that neomycin can cause physiological and developmental stress in insects, which should be taken into account when interpreting the results of studies using these model organisms.",2020,"Kemal Büyükgüzel, Ender Büyükgüzel, Ewa Chudzińska, Anetta Lewandowska-Wosik, Renata Gaj, Zbigniew Adamski"
Nutritional quality of Drosophila melanogaster as factitious prey for rearing the predatory bug Orius majusculus,31990127,10.1111/1744-7917.12758,"The predatory bug, Orius majusculus (Reuter), is an important predator of thrips commercially produced for augmentative releases using the eggs of the Mediterranean flour moth Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller). In this study, we assessed the potential for using frozen adults of fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen), either as nymphal rearing diet or as diet throughout the entire life-cycle. We compared life-history traits and reproduction of predators when fed D. melanogaster with high lipid body content (lipid-rich) and with high protein body content (protein-rich), using a diet of 100% E. kuehniella eggs as control. We also analyzed the biochemical composition of both prey and predator in order to assess the nutritional quality of each diet, which partially explained the adequacy of the different diets for O. majusculus. There were significant differences between predators fed the two types of D. melanogaster, with the protein-rich flies as diet providing the best results in terms of mortality and fecundity. Furthermore, we show that while feeding O. majusculus throughout their development with D. melanogaster increases mortality and reduces reproduction, protein-rich D. melanogaster can be used as nymphal diet with minimal reduction in reproductivity and minimal increase in mortality.",2020,"Marta Montoro, Henrik H De Fine Licht, Lene Sigsgaard"
The genetic basis for mating-induced sex differences in starvation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,26358400,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2015.09.002,"Multiple genetic and environmental factors interact to influence starvation resistance, which is an important determinant of fitness in many organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster. Recent studies have revealed that mating can alter starvation resistance in female D. melanogaster, but little is known about the behavioral and physiological mechanisms underlying such mating-mediated changes in starvation resistance. In the present study, we first investigated whether the effect of mating on starvation resistance is sex-specific in D. melanogaster. As indicated by a significant sex×mating status interaction, mating increased starvation resistance in females but not in males. In female D. melanogaster, post-mating increase in starvation resistance was mainly attributed to increases in food intake and in the level of lipid storage relative to lean body weight. We then performed quantitative genetic analysis to estimate the proportion of the total phenotypic variance attributable to genetic differences (i.e., heritability) for starvation resistance in mated male and female D. melanogaster. The narrow-sense heritability (h(2)) of starvation resistance was 0.235 and 0.155 for males and females, respectively. Mated females were more resistant to starvation than males in all genotypes, but the degree of such sexual dimorphism varied substantially among genotypes, as indicated by a significant sex×genotype interaction for starvation resistance. Cross-sex genetic correlation was greater than 0 but less than l for starvation resistance, implying that the genetic architecture of this trait was partially shared between the two sexes. For both sexes, starvation resistance was positively correlated with longevity and lipid storage at genetic level. The present study suggests that sex differences in starvation resistance depend on mating status and have a genetic basis in D. melanogaster.",2015,"Taehwan Jang, Kwang Pum Lee"

Real-time PCR and western blot analysis showed that SNP enhanced the gene expression of Diptericin, Drosomycin, Defensin, PGRP-LC and the protein level of Toll, p-JNK and Relish， that suggested the promoting effect of SNP on the immune damage repair of D. melanogaster exposed to Cd (VI). The increased level of Indy, Parkin and AMPK indicated the regulated effect of SNP on the longevity-related pathways through ageing-related moleculars of D. melanogaster exposed to Cd (VI).

Circadian rhythm mutations in Drosophila melanogaster affect short-term fluctuations in the male's courtship song,6779281,10.1073/pnas.77.11.6729,"Courtship song in Drosophila is produced by the male's wing vibration and consists of pulses of tone produced at intervals of approximately 34 msec in D. melanogaster and 48 msec in D. simulans. We have observed that the intervals between these pulses are not constant but fluctuate rhythmically with periods of approximately 1 min in D. melanogaster and 0.5 min in D. simulans. In D. melanogaster, three allelic per mutations have been isolated which affect the periodicity of the circadian oscillators affecting both eclosion and locomotor activity [Konopka, R. & Benzer S. (1971) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 68, 2112-2116]. Each of the per alleles--pers, which shortens the circadian period, perI, which lengthens it, and perO, which abolishes it--strikingly affects the 60-sec song rhythm in a parallel fashion. Therefore, both circadian rhythms and a very short, noncircadian oscillation appear to be influenced by the same gene.",1980,"C P Kyriacou, J C Hall"

The infection status of 266 lines from 12 populations along the eastern coast of Australia was determined by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining of embryos. All populations contained both infected and uninfected flies. Infection frequencies varied between populations but there was no discernible geographical pattern.

Characterization of a novel Drosophila melanogaster acylphosphatase,12560098,10.1016/s0014-5793(02)03901-7,Analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster EST database led to the characterization of a novel acylphosphatase (AcPDro2).

The two proteins show a 60% homology with both vertebrate isoenzymes. All the residues involved in the catalytic mechanism are conserved. AcPDro2 is a stable enzyme with a correct globular folded structure. Its activity on benzoylphosphate shows higher K(cat) but lower K(m) with respect to AcPDro.

C virus was injected into the different hosts and serially passaged in them. The extracts from each passage were biologically assayed on virus free D. melanogaster. Four different situations were found. 1) A high level of multiplication leading, in 45 strains of Drosophilidae, to the early death of the hosts. This phenomenon was particularly related to the subgroup melanogaster and in the dipteron Ceratitis capitata. The titre of the virus in this latter insect was high as in D. melanogaster, but its cellular tropism was wider. 2) An active viral multiplication but without symptoms, in two strains of D. immigrans and in the lepidopteron Galleria mellonella. In these two insects, the viral titre was clearly inferior to that observed in D. melanogaster. 3) Maintenance of the virus, without multiplication in the dipteron Calliphora erythrocephala and the lepidopteron Arctia caja. In these insects, the decrease in virus titre was directly related to the dilution factor at each passage. 4) Rapid disappearance of the virus, in the mosquitoes Culex pipiens and Aedes aegypti. The host range of C virus is compared to that of Sigma virus of Drosophila and of two other picornaviruses of insects.",1976,F X Jousset
The evolution of small gene clusters: evidence for an independent origin of the maltase gene cluster in Drosophila virilis and Drosophila melanogaster,9335139,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025715,"We analyzed a 5,770-bp genomic region of Drosophila virilis that contains a cluster of two maltase genes showing sequence similarity with genes in a cluster of three maltase genes previously identified in Drosophila melanogaster.

In addition to being different in gene number, the cluster of genes in D. virilis differs dramatically in intron-exon structure from the maltase genes in D. melanogaster, the transcriptional orientation of the genes in the cluster also differs between the species. Our findings support a model in which the maltase gene cluster in D. virilis and D. melanogaster evolved independently. Furthermore, while in D. melanogaster the maltase gene cluster lies only 10 kb distant from the larval cuticle gene cluster, the maltase and larval cuticle gene clusters in D. virilis are located very far apart and on a different chromosome than that expected from the known chromosome arm homologies between D. virilis and D. melanogaster.

The fruit fly D. melanogaster serves as a feasible model to understand the mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases. Our study shows a dose-dependent PQ-induced neuropathology in the brain tissue of D. melanogaster as evidenced by hematoxylin and eosin staining, silver nitrate staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Electron microscopic study of D. melanogaster brain tissue exhibited vacuolar degeneration and significant neuronal damage across the nervous tissue structure in comparison with control. Our findings also indicate a dose-dependent locomotor impairment and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) specific activity in PQ-treated D. melanogaster. These PQ-induced neuroanatomical changes and decreased SOD specific activity showed a significant association with oxidative DNA damage as observed by alkaline comet assay. Additionally, we show, for the first time, a dose-dependent PQ-induced cytotoxicity in the D-Mel2 cells suggesting loss of neuronal cell viability via cytotoxic damage.

Phenotype and transmission efficiency of artificial and natural male-killing Spiroplasma infections in Drosophila melanogaster,22085686,10.1016/j.jip.2011.10.003,"Many insect species carry inherited Spiroplasma bacteria which act as important partners and antagonists. The nature of symbioses between Spiroplasma and insects has been most extensively studied in the interaction between male-killing Spiroplasma infection and Drosophila melanogaster. For historical reasons, these studies have largely focussed on the Spiroplasma strain known as NSRO, derived from Drosophila nebulosa and transinfected into D. melanogaster. More recently, D. melanogaster naturally infected with Spiroplasma were discovered. Whilst the well studied strain NSRO is closely related to that found natively in D. melanogaster, it is unclear whether strains from D. nebulosa reflect a natural interaction when placed in D. melanogaster. In this paper, we determine if NSRO has similar or different properties from strains of Spiroplasma naturally infecting D. melanogaster in terms of transmission efficiency and the strength and timing of male-killing. Native infections were observed to have higher transmission efficiency than introduced NSRO infections during the early phases of host reproduction, but not during late reproduction. The timing and intensity of male-killing did not differ between infection classes. As a precautionary measure, it is proposed that future work seeking to reveal the nature of coevolved Spiroplasma-Drosophila interactions use the native strain.",2012,"Kate J Hutchence, Rémi Padé, Heather L Swift, Daimark Bennett, Gregory D D Hurst"
The evolutionary genetics of the hobo transposable element in the Drosophila melanogaster complex,7813919,10.1007/BF01435241,"Hobo elements are a family of transposable elements found in Drosophila melanogaster and its three sibling species: D. simulans, D. mauritiana and D. sechellia.

At the evolutionary level some hobo-hybridizing sequences have also been found in the other members of the melanogaster subgroup and in many members of the related montium subgroup. Surveys of older collected strains of D. melanogaster suggest that complete hobo elements were absent prior to 50 years ago and that they have recently been introduced into this species by horizontal transfer. In this paper we review our findings and those of others, in order to precisely describe the geographical distribution and the evolutionary history of hobo in the D. melanogaster complex.

We found that both types of S. carpocapsae upregulate MyD88 (Toll), but not PGRP-LE (Imd); whereas axenic S. carpocapsae strongly upregulate Wengen (Jnk), Domeless (Jak/Stat), Dawdle (TGFβ, Activin), and Decapentaplegic (TGFβ, BMP). We further found that inactivation of Wengen and Decapentaplegic confers a survival advantage to larvae infected with axenic S. carpocapsae, whereas mutating PGRP-LE promotes the survival of larvae infected with symbiotic nematodes.",2018,"Shruti Yadav, Sonali Gupta, Ioannis Eleftherianos"
Neuron-specific overexpression of core clock genes improves stress-resistance and extends lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster,30415070,10.1016/j.exger.2018.11.005,"Gene expression is much altered in aging. We observed age-dependent decline of core clock genes' expression in the whole body of the fruit fly. We hypothesized that inducible overexpression of clock genes (cry, per, tim, cyc and Clk) in the nervous system can improve healthspan of D. melanogaster. We studied the lifespan of transgenic Drosophila and showed life extension for cry, per, cyc and tim genes. It was also the significant positive changes in the stress-resistance of flies overexpressing core clock genes in conditions of hyperthermia, hyperoxia, starvation and persistent lighting. The overexpression of per and cry restore circadian rhythms of locomotor activity. The results presented support the hypotheses that the compensation of circadian oscillator genes expression can improve the healthspan in Drosophila melanogaster.",2019,"Ilya Solovev, Eugenia Dobrovolskaya, Mikhail Shaposhnikov, Maksim Sheptyakov, Alexey Moskalev"
Isolation of protease-free alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) from Drosophila simulans and several homozygous and heterozygous Drosophila melanogaster variants,9562904,10.1023/a:1018796002063,"The enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) from several naturally occurring ADH variants of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans was isolated. Affinity chromatography with the ligand Cibacron Blue and elution with NAD+ showed similar behavior for D. melanogaster ADH-FF, ADH-71k, and D. simulans ADH. Introduction of a second Cibacron Blue affinity chromatography step, with gradient elution with NAD+, resulted in pure and stable enzymes. D. melanogaster ADH-SS cannot be eluted from the affinity chromatography column at a high concentration of NAD+ and required a pH gradient for its purification, preceded by a wash step with a high concentration of NAD+. Hybrid Drosophila melanogaster alcohol dehydrogenase FS has been isolated from heterozygous flies, using affinity chromatography with first elution at a high concentration NAD+, directly followed by affinity chromatography elution with a pH gradient. Incubation of equal amounts of pure homodimers of Drosophila melanogaster ADH-FF and ADH-SS, in the presence of 3 M urea at pH 8.6, for 30 min at room temperature, followed by reassociation yielded active Drosophila melanogaster ADH-FS heterodimers. No proteolytic degradation was found after incubation of purified enzyme preparations in the absence or presence of SDS, except for some degradation of ADH-SS after very long incubation times. The thermostabilities of D. melanogaster ADH-71k and ADH-SS were almost identical and were higher than those of D. melanogaster ADH-FF and D. simulans ADH. The thermostability of D. melanogaster ADH-FS was lower than those of D. melanogaster ADH-FF and ADH-SS. D. melanogaster ADH-FF and ADH-71k have identical inhibition constants with the ligand Cibacron Blue at pH 8.6, which are two times higher at pH 9.5. The Ki values for D. simulans ADH are three times lower at both pH values. D. melanogaster ADH-SS and ADH-FS have similar Ki values, which are lower than those for D. melanogaster ADH-FF at pH 8.6. But at pH 9.5 the Ki value for ADH-FS is the same as at pH 8.6, while that of ADH-SS is seven times higher. Kinetic parameters of Drosophila melanogaster ADH-FF, ADH-SS, and ADH-71k and Drosophila simulans ADH, at pH 8.6 and 9.5, showed little or no variation in K(m)eth values. The K(m)NAD values measured at pH 9.5 for Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenases are all lower than those measured at pH 8.6.

The Combined Effect of Methyl- and Ethyl-Paraben on Lifespan and Preadult Development Period of Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae),28076277,10.1093/jisesa/iev146,"Parabens are widely used as preservative substances in foods, pharmaceuticals, industrial products, and cosmetics. But several studies have cautioned that parabens have estrogenic or endocrine-disrupting properties. Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal model in vivo to detect the toxic effects of chemistry. The study was designed to assess the potential additive toxic effects of methylparaben (MP) and ethylparaben (EP) mixture (MP + EP) on lifespan and preadult development period in D. melanogaster The data revealed that the MP + EP can reduce the longevity of flies compared with the control group, consistent with a significant reduction in malondialdehyde levels and an increase in superoxide dismutase activities. Furthermore, MP + EP may have a greater toxic effect on longevity of flies than separate using with the same concentration. Additionally, parabens had a nonmonotonic dose-response effect on D. melanogaster preadult development period, showing that MP + EP delayed preadult development period compared with control group while individual MP or EP significantly shortened (P < 0.01) at low concentration (300 mg/l). In conclusion, MP + EP had the potential additive toxicity on lifespan and preadult development period for D. melanogaster.",2016,"Qi Chen, Chenguang Pan, Yajuan Li, Min Zhang, Wei Gu"
Genetic basis of natural variation in D. melanogaster antibacterial immunity,15031506,10.1126/science.1092447,"Many genes involved in Drosophila melanogaster innate immune processes have been identified, but whether naturally occurring polymorphism in these genes leads to variation in immune competence among wild flies has not been tested. We report here substantial variability among wild-derived D. melanogaster in the ability to suppress infection by a Gram-negative entomopathogen, Serratia marcescens. Variability in immune competence was significantly associated with nucleotide polymorphism in 16 innate immunity genes, corresponding primarily to pathogen recognition and intracellular signaling loci, and substantial epistasis was detected between intracellular signaling and antimicrobial peptide genes. Variation in these genes, therefore, seems to drive variability in immunocompetence among wild Drosophila.",2004,"Brian P Lazzaro, Bonnielin K Sceurman, Andrew G Clark"
Mitochondrial-nuclear epistasis affects fitness within species but does not contribute to fixed incompatibilities between species of Drosophila,20624176,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01077.x,"Efficient mitochondrial function requires physical interactions between the proteins encoded by the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Coevolution between these genomes may result in the accumulation of incompatibilities between divergent lineages. We test whether mitochondrial-nuclear incompatibilities have accumulated within the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup by combining divergent mitochondrial and nuclear lineages and quantifying the effects on relative fitness. Precise placement of nine mtDNAs from D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. mauritiana into two D. melanogaster nuclear genetic backgrounds reveals significant mitochondrial-nuclear epistasis affecting fitness in females. Combining the mitochondrial genomes with three different D. melanogaster X chromosomes reveals significant epistasis for male fitness between X-linked and mitochondrial variation. However, we find no evidence that the more than 500 fixed differences between the mitochondrial genomes of D. melanogaster and the D. simulans species complex are incompatible with the D. melanogaster nuclear genome. Rather, the interactions of largest effect occur between mitochondrial and nuclear polymorphisms that segregate within species of the D. melanogaster species subgroup. We propose that a low mitochondrial substitution rate, resulting from a low mutation rate and/or efficient purifying selection, precludes the accumulation of mitochondrial-nuclear incompatibilities among these Drosophila species.",2010,"Kristi L Montooth, Colin D Meiklejohn, Dawn N Abt, David M Rand"
Molecular Mechanisms for High Hydrostatic Pressure-Induced Wing Mutagenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,26446369,10.1038/srep14965,"Although High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) as an important physical and chemical tool has been increasingly applied to research of organism, the response mechanisms of organism to HHP have not been elucidated clearly thus far. To identify mutagenic mechanisms of HHP on organisms, here, we treated Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster) eggs with HHP. Approximately 75% of the surviving flies showed significant morphological abnormalities from the egg to the adult stages compared with control flies (p < 0.05). Some eggs displayed abnormal chorionic appendages, some larvae were large and red, and some adult flies showed wing abnormalities. Abnormal wing phenotypes of D. melanogaster induced by HHP were used to investigate the mutagenic mechanisms of HHP on organism. Thus 285 differentially expressed genes associated with wing mutations were identified using Affymetrix Drosophila Genome Array 2.0 and verified with RT-PCR. We also compared wing development-related central genes in the mutant flies with control flies using DNA sequencing to show two point mutations in the vestigial (vg) gene. This study revealed the mutagenic mechanisms of HHP-induced mutagenesis in D. melanogaster and provided a new model for the study of evolution on organisms.",2015,"Hua Wang, Kai Wang, Guanjun Xiao, Junfeng Ma, Bingying Wang, Sile Shen, Xueqi Fu, Guangtian Zou, Bo Zou"

The highest amount of D. melanogaster ADH was obtained from a multicopy plasmid with the D. melanogaster Adh gene expressed constitutively under the control of yeast ADCp promoter. The D. melanogaster enzyme was produced in cell extracts, as assessed by Coomassie blue staining and Western blotting after polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and it was fully active and able to complement the yeast ADH deficiency. Results show that D. melanogaster ADH subunits synthesized in yeast are able to assemble into functional dimeric forms.

A Dalpha6 knockout strain of Drosophila melanogaster confers a high level of resistance to spinosad,17244547,10.1016/j.ibmb.2006.11.009,"A null mutation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit Dalpha6, in Drosophila melanogaster, confers 1181-fold resistance to a new and increasingly important biopesticide, spinosad. This study's molecular characterisation of a spinosad resistance mechanism identifies Dalpha6 as a major spinosad target in D. melanogaster. Although D. melanogaster is not a major field pest, target site resistances found in this species are often conserved in pest species. This, combined with the high degree of evolutionary conservation of nAChR subunits, suggests that mutations in Dalpha6 orthologues may underpin the spinosad resistance identified in several economically important field pests.",2007,"Trent Perry, John A McKenzie, Philip Batterham"
Aging of the innate immune response in Drosophila melanogaster,15771614,10.1111/j.1474-9728.2005.00147.x,"Increased activation of the innate immune system is a common feature of aging animals, including mammals and Drosophila melanogaster. With age, D. melanogaster progressively express higher levels of many antimicrobial peptides. It is unknown, however, whether this pattern reflects age-dependent changes in the function of the immune system itself or arises simply because aged adults have greater cumulative exposure to pathogens. Here we demonstrate that aged D. melanogaster transcribe more antimicrobial diptericin when experimentally exposed to septic bacterial infections. This strong net response in older females is the result of persistent diptericin transcription upon septic exposure, whereas young females rapidly terminate this induction. In contrast to their response to septic exposure, when exposed to killed bacteria aged females have less capacity to induce diptericin. Because this functional capacity of innate immunity declines with age, we conclude that female Drosophila undergo immune senescence. Furthermore, we show that fecundity is reduced by induction of innate immunity via the immune deficiency pathway. Consequently, maximum reproduction will occur when the immune response is tightly controlled in young females, even if this increases infection risk at later ages.",2005,"Melissa Zerofsky, Ephat Harel, Neal Silverman, Marc Tatar"
The effect of developmental temperature on the genetic architecture underlying size and thermal clines in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans from the east coast of Australia,21091469,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01196.x,"Body size and thermal tolerance clines in Drosophila melanogaster occur along the east coast of Australia. However the extent to which temperature affects the genetic architecture underlying the observed clinal divergence remains unknown. Clinal variation in these traits is associated with cosmopolitan chromosome inversions that cline in D. melanogaster. Whether this association influences the genetic architecture for these traits in D. melanogaster is unclear. Drosophila simulans shows linear clines in body size, but nonlinear clines in cold resistance. Clinally varying inversions are absent in D. simulans. Line-cross and clinal analyses were performed between tropical and temperate populations of D. melanogaster and D. simulans from the east coast of Australia to investigate whether clinal patterns and genetic effects contributing to clinal divergence in wing centroid size, thorax length, wing-to-thorax ratio, cold and heat resistance differed under different developmental temperatures (18 °C, 25 °C, and 29 °C). Developmental temperature influenced the genetic architecture in both species. Similarities between D. melanogaster and D. simulans suggest clinally varying inversion polymorphisms have little influence on the genetic architecture underlying clinal divergence in size in D. melanogaster. Differing genetic architectures across different temperatures highlight the need to consider different environments in future evolutionary and molecular studies of phenotypic divergence.",2011,"Belinda van Heerwaarden, Carla M Sgrò"

They also provide novel candidate features for annotation. The percentage of ecores mapping outside annotations in the A. gambiae genome is about fourfold higher than in D. melanogaster. The A. gambiae genome assembly also contains a high proportion of duplicated ecores, possibly resulting from artefactual sequence duplications in the genome assembly. The occurrence of 4063 ecores in the D. melanogaster genome outside annotations suggests that some genes are not yet or only partially annotated.

Incompatibility between X chromosome factor and pericentric heterochromatic region causes lethality in hybrids between Drosophila melanogaster and its sibling species,22446316,10.1534/genetics.112.139683,"The Dobzhansky-Muller model posits that postzygotic reproductive isolation results from the evolution of incompatible epistatic interactions between species: alleles that function in the genetic background of one species can cause sterility or lethality in the genetic background of another species. Progress in identifying and characterizing factors involved in postzygotic isolation in Drosophila has remained slow, mainly because Drosophila melanogaster, with all of its genetic tools, forms dead or sterile hybrids when crossed to its sister species, D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. mauritiana. To circumvent this problem, we used chromosome deletions and duplications from D. melanogaster to map two hybrid incompatibility loci in F(1) hybrids with its sister species. We mapped a recessive factor to the pericentromeric heterochromatin of the X chromosome in D. simulans and D. mauritiana, which we call heterochromatin hybrid lethal (hhl), which causes lethality in F(1) hybrid females with D. melanogaster. As F(1) hybrid males hemizygous for a D. mauritiana (or D. simulans) X chromosome are viable, the lethality of deficiency hybrid females implies that a dominant incompatible partner locus exists on the D. melanogaster X. Using small segments of the D. melanogaster X chromosome duplicated onto the Y chromosome, we mapped a dominant factor that causes hybrid lethality to a small 24-gene region of the D. melanogaster X. We provide evidence suggesting that it interacts with hhl(mau). The location of hhl is consistent with the emerging theme that hybrid incompatibilities in Drosophila involve heterochromatic regions and factors that interact with the heterochromatin.",2012,"M Victoria Cattani, Daven C Presgraves"

P-elements in D. simulans appear to have been acquired recently from D. melanogaster probably via a single horizontal transfer event. Expression data indicate that the P-element is processed in the germ line of D. simulans, and genomic data show an enrichment of P-element insertions in putative origins of replication, similar to that seen in D. melanogaster.

Evolution of mir-92a underlies natural morphological variation in Drosophila melanogaster,23453955,10.1016/j.cub.2013.02.018,"Identifying the genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic change is essential to understanding how gene regulatory networks and ultimately the genotype-to-phenotype map evolve. It is recognized that microRNAs (miRNAs) have the potential to facilitate evolutionary change [1-3]; however, there are no known examples of natural morphological variation caused by evolutionary changes in miRNA expression. Therefore, the contribution of miRNAs to evolutionary change remains unknown [1, 4]. Drosophila melanogaster subgroup species display a portion of trichome-free cuticle on the femur of the second leg called the ""naked valley."" It was previously shown that Ultrabithorax (Ubx) is involved in naked valley variation between D. melanogaster and D. simulans [5, 6]. However, naked valley size also varies among populations of D. melanogaster, ranging from 1,000 up to 30,000 μm(2). We investigated the genetic basis of intraspecific differences in the naked valley in D. melanogaster and found that neither Ubx nor shavenbaby (svb) [7, 8] contributes to this morphological difference. Instead, we show that changes in mir-92a expression underlie the evolution of naked valley size in D. melanogaster through repression of shavenoid (sha) [9].

Light-dependent pupation site preferences in Drosophila. II. Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,6803758,10.1007/BF01065790,"Drosophila melanogaster prefers to pupate in the dark, while its sibling species, D. simulans, prefers the light when the species are tested in isolation and when cultured and tested together. Reciprocal interspecific hybridizations were carried out and the F1 individuals were tested. Progeny from the cross of D. melanogaster females with D. simulans males chose pupations sites exactly intermediate between those of the two parental species, while the reciprocal-cross offspring preferred light pupation sites. The pupation site preferences (PSPs) of the hybrids are compatible with a sex-linked locus or loci influencing light-dependent PSP in this pair of species. Examination of light preferences of larvae prior to the late third instar demonstrates that these preferences are highly specific, being restricted to the time just before pupation. During the first two larval instars D. melanogaster is quite photopositive while D. simulans is comparatively photoneutral. These differences in light-dependent behaviour could aid in reducing competition between the two species.",1981,"M Manning, T A Markow"

This explains previous observations that D. melanogaster males display the strongest courtship toward mosaics with female abdomens. We also show that males of the sibling species Drosophila simulans preferentially court D. melanogaster mosaics with male abdomens.

HeT-A elements in Drosophila virilis: retrotransposon telomeres are conserved across the Drosophila genus,14614149,10.1073/pnas.1936193100,"Drosophila melanogaster telomeres are composed of two retrotransposons, HeT-A and TART. Drosophila virilis has recently been shown to have telomere-specific TART elements with many of the characteristics of their D. melanogaster homologues. We now report identification of the second telomere-specific retrotransposon, HeT-A, from D. virilis. These results show that HeT-A and TART have been maintaining telomeres in Drosophila for more than the 60 million years that separate D. melanogaster and D. virilis. All Drosophila species and stocks studied have both of these telomeric elements, suggesting that the elements collaborate, an assumption supported by evidence from D. melanogaster that their Gag proteins interact. Although the HeT-A sequence evolves at a high rate, the element retains the unusual structural features that characterize all HeT-A homologues. These features may be involved in the role of HeT-A at the telomere. The Gag protein from HeT-Avir is as much like TART Gag from other species as it is like HeT-A Gag, suggesting that these Gags are evolving under similar constraints, probably to maintain appropriate interactions with host telomeres and possibly to allow collaborative interactions like those seen in D. melanogaster.

Comparison of the amino acid sequences revealed that D.virilis DREF is 71% identical to its D. melanogaster homolog.

Expression of CR1 in the developing eye imaginal discs resulted in a severe rough eye phenotype in adult flies. Expression of CR3 also caused a rough eye phenotype, while that of CR2 had no apparent effect on eye morphology.

Drosophila melanogaster mitochondrial DNA: completion of the nucleotide sequence and evolutionary comparisons,8825764,10.1111/j.1365-2583.1995.tb00032.x,"The nucleotide sequence of the regions flanking the A+T region of Drosophila melanogaster mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been determined. Included are the genes encoding the transfer RNAs for valine, isoleucine, glutamine and methionine, the small ribosomal RNA and the 5'-coding sequences of the large ribosomal RNA and NADH dehydrogenase subunit II. This completes the nucleotide sequence of the D. melanogaster mitochondrial genome. The circular mtDNA of D. melanogaster varies in size among different populations largely due to length differences in the control region (Fauron & Wolstenholme, 1976; Fauron & Wolstenholme, 1980a, b); the mtDNA region we have sequenced, combined with those sequenced by others, yields a composite genome that is 19,517 bp in length as compared to 16,019 bp for the mtDNA of D. yakuba. D. melanogaster mtDNA exhibits an extreme bias in base composition; it comprises 82.2% deoxyadenylate and thymidylate residues as compared to 78.6% in D. yakuba mtDNA. All genes encoded in the mtDNA of both species are in identical locations and orientations.

The Pupal Ectoparasitoid Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae Regulates Cellular and Humoral Immunity of Host Drosophila melanogaster,31680999,10.3389/fphys.2019.01282,"The immunological interaction between Drosophila melanogaster and its larval parasitoids has been thoroughly investigated, however, little is known about the interaction between the host and its pupal parasitoids. Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae, a pupal ectoparasitoid of D. melanogaster, injects venom into its host while laying eggs on the puparium, which regulates host immunity and interrupts host development. To resist the invasion of parasitic wasps, various immune defense strategies have been developed in their hosts as a consequence of co-evolution. In this study, we mainly focused on the host immunomodulation by P. vindemmiae and thoroughly investigated cellular and humoral immune response, including cell adherence, cell viability, hemolymph melanization and the Toll, Imd, and JAK/STAT immune pathways. Our results indicated that venom had a significant inhibitory effect on lamellocyte adherence and induced plasmatocyte cell death. Venom injection and in vitro incubation strongly inhibited hemolymph melanization. More in-depth investigation revealed that the Toll and Imd immune pathways were immediately activated upon parasitization, followed by the JAK/STAT pathway, which was activated within the first 24 h post-parasitism. These regulatory effects were further validated by qPCR. Our present study manifested that P. vindemmiae regulated the cellular and humoral immune system of host D. melanogaster in many aspects. These findings lay the groundwork for studying the immunological interaction between D. melanogaster and its pupal parasitoid.",2019,"Lei Yang, Bin Wan, Bei-Bei Wang, Ming-Ming Liu, Qi Fang, Qi-Sheng Song, Gong-Yin Ye"
A Comprehensive Study of Genic Variation in Natural Populations of Drosophila melanogaster. III. Variations in Genetic Structure and Their Causes between Drosophila melanogaster and Its Sibling Species Drosophila simulans,17246411,,"The natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans were compared for their genetic structure. A total of 114 gene-protein loci were studied in four mainland (from Europe and Africa) and an island (Seychelle) populations of D. simulans and the results were compared with those obtained on the same set of homologous loci in fifteen worldwide populations of D. melanogaster. The main results are as follows: (1) D. melanogaster shows a significantly higher proportion of loci polymorphic than D. simulans (52% vs. 39%, P<0.05), (2) both species have similar mean heterozygosity and mean number of alleles per locus, (3) the two species share some highly polymorphic loci but they do not share loci that show high geographic differentiation, and (4) D. simulans shows significantly less geographic differentiation than D. melanogaster. The differences in genetic differentiation between the two species are limited to loci located on the X and second chromosomes only; loci on the third chromosome show similar level of geographic differentiation in both species. These two species have previously been shown to differ in their pattern of variation for chromosomal polymorphisms, quantitative and physiological characters, two-dimensional electrophoretic (2DE) proteins, middle repetitive DNA and mitochondrial DNA. Variation in niche-widths and/or genetic ""strategies"" of adaptation appear to be the main causes of differences in the genetic structure of these two species.",1987,"M Choudhary, R S Singh"
Determination of some biochemical and structural features of alcohol dehydrogenases from Drosophila simulans and Drosophila virilis. Comparison of their properties with the Drosophila melanogaster Adhs enzyme,6796069,10.1042/bj1950061,"The biochemical properties of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase of two different Drosophila species, Drosophila simulans and Drosophila virilis, were studied and compared with those of Drosophila melanogaster Adhs enzyme. All of them consist of two identical subunits of molecular weight 27800 and share significant similarities in function. The substrate specificities of these enzymes were characterized and Km(app.) and Vmax.(app.) values were calculated. All these alcohol dehydrogenases show greater affinity for secondary rather than for primary alcohols. The amino acid compositions of the three enzymes were determined, and there is a close similarity between the D. simulans and the D. melanogaster enzymes, but there are significant differences from the alcohol dehydrogenase of D. virilis. The N-terminal amino acid is blocked and the C-terminal amino acid is the same for all three alcohol dehydrogenases. The enzymes from the three species were carboxymethylated and digested with trypsin.

Nucleotide variation in the triosephosphate isomerase (Tpi) locus of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,9615457,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025979,"DNA sequence variation in a 1.1-kb region including the coding portion of the Tpi locus was examined in 25 homozygous third-chromosome lines of Drosophila melanogaster, nine lines of Drosophila simulans, and one line of Drosophila yakuba. Our data show that the widespread allozyme polymorphism observed in cosmopolitan D. melanogaster is due to a glutamic acid substitution occurring in a phylogenetically conserved lysine that has been identified as part of the ""hinged-lid"" active site of the enzyme. This observation suggests that the replacement polymorphism may have important functional consequences. One replacement polymorphism was also observed in D. simulans, although its functional relevance is more difficult to assess, since it affects a site that is not strongly conserved. This amino acid change in D. simulans is associated with a single lineage possessing seven unique silent substitutions, which may be indicative of balancing selection or population subdivision. The absence of fixed amino acid differences between D. melanogaster and D. simulans and only a single difference with D. yakuba suggests that triose phosphate isomerase is under strong functional constraint. Silent variation is slightly higher for D. melanogaster than for D. simulans. Finally, we outline the general lack of evidence for old balanced polymorphisms at allozyme loci in D. melanogaster.",1998,"E Hasson, I N Wang, L W Zeng, M Kreitman, W F Eanes"
Increased production of piRNAs from euchromatic clusters and genes in Anopheles gambiae compared with Drosophila melanogaster,26617674,10.1186/s13072-015-0041-5,"Background:
      
    

    
      Specific genomic loci, termed Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) clusters, manufacture piRNAs that serve as guides for the inactivation of complementary transposable elements (TEs). The piRNA pathway has been accurately detailed in Drosophila melanogaster, while it remains poorly examined in other insects. This pathway is increasingly recognized as critical for germline development and reproduction. Understanding of the piRNA functions in mosquitoes could offer an opportunity for disease vector control by the reduction of their reproductive potential.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      To analyze the similarities and differences in this pathway between Drosophila and mosquito, we performed an in-depth analysis of the genomic loci producing piRNAs and their targets in the African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. We identified 187 piRNA clusters in the An. gambiae genome and 155 piRNA clusters in the D. melanogaster genome. We demonstrate that many more piRNA clusters in the mosquito compared with the fruit fly are uni-directionally transcribed and are located outside pericentromeric heterochromatin. About 11 % of the An. gambiae piRNA population map to gene transcripts. This is a noticeable increase compared with the ~6 % of the piRNA population mapped to genes in D. melanogaster. A subset of the piRNA-enriched genes in An. gambiae has functions related to reproduction and development. At least 24 and 65 % of the mapped piRNAs correspond to genomic TE sequences in An. gambiae and D. melanogaster, respectively. DNA transposons and non-LTR retrotransposons are more abundant in An. gambiae, while LTR retrotransposons are more abundant in D. melanogaster. Yet, piRNAs predominantly target LTR retrotransposons in both species, which may point to a distinct feature of these elements compared to the other classes of TEs concerning their silencing by the piRNA pathway.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Here, we demonstrate that piRNA-producing loci have more ubiquitous distribution in the An. gambiae genome than in the genome of D. melanogaster. Also, protein-coding genes have an increased role in production of piRNAs in the germline of this mosquito. Genes involved in germline and embryonic development of An. gambiae generate a substantial portion of piRNAs, suggesting a role of the piRNA pathway in the epigenetic regulation of the reproductive processes in the African malaria vector.",2015,"Phillip George, Silke Jensen, Romain Pogorelcnik, Jiyoung Lee, Yi Xing, Emilie Brasset, Chantal Vaury, Igor V Sharakhov"
Why there is a one-way crossability between D. melanogaster and D. simulans? An ontogenic explanation,15088667,10.1023/b:gene.0000017650.45464.f4,"In the Drosophila melanogaster complex, females D. melanogaster mate relatively easily with males Drosophila simulans but the reciprocal cross is rare. The species sexual isolation is mainly based on chemical and acoustic signal exchanges between partners. The male side of this communication is investigated in this paper in order to understand the asymmetry. In D. melanogaster the acoustic signature is highly significant, and is synergistically reinforced by the chemical signal. In D. simulans the importance of the two signaling channels seems to be reversed. This could explain why D. simulans males produce less precise interpulse interval (IPI) mean value in the courtship song, which can readily overlap those of D. melanogaster. As the males of the two species use the same chemical key, D. simulans males could be recognized by D. melanogaster females as a conspecific.",2004,"Bruno Moulin, Thierry Aubin, Jean-Marc Jallon"

"A genomic comparison of faster-sex, faster-X, and faster-male evolution between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura",16612543,10.1007/s00239-005-0165-5,"A genomic comparison of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura provides a unique opportunity to investigate factors involved in sequence divergence. The chromosomal arrangements of these species include an autosomal segment in D. melanogaster which is homologous to part of the X chromosome in D. pseudoobscura. Using orthologues to calculate rates of nonsynonymous (d(N)) substitutions, we found genes on the X chromosome to be significantly more diverged than those on the autosomes, but it is not true for segment 3L-XR which is autosomal in D. melanogaster (3L) and X-linked in D. pseudoobscura (XR). We also found that the median d(N) values for genes having reproductive functions in either the male, the female, or both sexes are higher than those for sequences without reproductive function and even higher for sequences involved in male-specific function. These estimates of divergence for male sex-related sequences are most likely underestimates, as the very rapidly evolving reproductive genes would tend to lose homology sooner and thus not be included in the comparison of orthologues. We also noticed a high proportion of male reproductive genes among the othologous genes with the highest rates of d(N). Reproductive genes with and without an orthologue in D. pseudoobscura were compared among D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. yakuba and it was found that there were in fact higher rates of divergence in the group without a D. pseudoobscura orthologue. These results, from widely separated taxa, bolster the thesis that sexual system genes experience accelerated rates of change in comparison to nonsexual genes in evolution and speciation.",2006,"Heidi Musters, Melanie A Huntley, Rama S Singh"
The l(2)gl homologue of Drosophila pseudoobscura suppresses tumorigenicity in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster,8389031,,"Mutations in the tumour-suppressor gene lethal(2)giant larvae (l(2)gl) of Drosophila cause malignant transformation of the optic centres of the larval brain and the imaginal discs.

Comparison of this sequence with D. melanogaster reveals a significant sequence conservation within the l(2)gl protein-coding domain and a strong sequence divergence in the 5' promoter region and in the introns. The deduced amino acid sequence of the D. pseudoobscura l(2)gl protein shows 17.7% divergence from D. melanogaster. However, despite these evolutionary differences, the D. pseudoobscura l(2)gl gene can fully suppress tumorigenicity and restore a normal development in l(2)gl-deficient D. melanogaster flies, although the rescued animals display poor viability and fertility. Furthermore, in D. melanogaster transgenic flies, the D. pseudoobscura l(2)gl protein is produced at a similar level as the D. melanogaster l(2)gl protein and displays an identical spatial pattern of expression. This shows that the highly divergent cis-regulatory elements of the D. pseudoobscura transgene can be fully recognized in D. melanogaster and lead to the synthesis of a transgenic protein that has enough specificity conserved for replacing the tumour-suppressor function normally fulfilled by the D. melanogaster l(2)gl protein.",1993,"I Török, K Hartenstein, A Kalmes, R Schmitt, D Strand, B M Mechler"
Heat shock protein 70 from a thermotolerant Diptera species provides higher thermoresistance to Drosophila larvae than correspondent endogenous gene,28796386,10.1111/imb.12339,"Heat shock proteins (Hsp70s) from two Diptera species that drastically differ in their heat shock response and longevity were investigated.

Drosophila cg6568 was expressed at various levels during all developmental stages, and the expression levels were modulated by M. marinum in a time-dependent manner. 20-hydroxyecdysone induced Drosophila cg6568 transcription both in vitro and in vivo. Using flies expressing cg6568 RNAi, we found that cg6568 was essential both for D. melanogaster survival and the exertion of antimicrobial effects during M. marinum infection.

RNomics in Drosophila melanogaster: identification of 66 candidates for novel non-messenger RNAs,12736298,10.1093/nar/gkg361,"By generating a specialised cDNA library from four different developmental stages of Drosophila melanogaster, we have identified 66 candidates for small non-messenger RNAs (snmRNAs) and have confirmed their expression by northern blot analysis. Thirteen of them were expressed at certain stages of D.melanogaster development, only. Thirty-five species belong to the class of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), divided into 15 members from the C/D subclass and 20 members from the H/ACA subclass, which mostly guide 2'-O-methylation and pseudouridylation, respectively, of rRNA and snRNAs. These also include two outstanding C/D snoRNAs, U3 and U14, both functioning as pre-rRNA chaperones. Surprisingly, the sequence of the Drosophila U14 snoRNA reflects a major change of function of this snoRNA in Diptera relative to yeast and vertebrates. Among the 22 snmRNAs lacking known sequence and structure motifs, five were located in intergenic regions, two in introns, five in untranslated regions of mRNAs, eight were derived from open reading frames, and two were transcribed opposite to an intron. Interestingly, detection of two RNA species from this group implies that certain snmRNA species are processed from alternatively spliced pre-mRNAs. Surprisingly, a few snmRNA sequences could not be found on the published D.melanogaster genome, which might suggest that more snmRNA genes (as well as mRNAs) are hidden in unsequenced regions of the genome.",2003,"Guozhong Yuan, Christian Klämbt, Jean-Pierre Bachellerie, Jürgen Brosius, Alexander Hüttenhofer"

The recent spread of a vertically transmitted virus through populations of Drosophila melanogaster,17725574,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03460.x,"The sigma virus is a vertically transmitted pathogen that commonly infects natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. This virus is the only known host-specific pathogen of D. melanogaster, and so offers a unique opportunity to study the genetics of Drosophila-viral interactions in a natural system. To elucidate the population genetic processes that operate in sigma virus populations, we collected D. melanogaster from 10 populations across three continents. We found that the sigma virus had a prevalence of 0-15% in these populations. Compared to other RNA viruses, we found that levels of viral genetic diversity are very low across Europe and North America. Based on laboratory measurements of the viral substitution rate, we estimate that most European and North American viral isolates shared a common ancestor approximately 200 years ago. We suggest two explanations for this: the first is that D. melanogaster has recently acquired the sigma virus; the second is that a single viral type has recently swept through D. melanogaster populations. Furthermore, in contrast to Drosophila populations, we find that the sigma viral populations are highly structured. This is surprising for a vertically transmitted pathogen that has a similar migration rate to its host. We suggest that the low structure in the viral populations can be explained by the smaller effective population size of the virus.",2007,"Jennifer A Carpenter, Darren J Obbard, Xulio Maside, Francis M Jiggins"

      Previous studies, focusing on the effects of abused drugs, have used mice or rats as the main animal models; the present study tries to introduce a simple animal model. For this propose, we investigated the effects of oral morphine consumption by parents on the development of larvae, pupae and imago in Drosophila Melanogaster (D. Melanogaster).
    

    
  


        Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      In this experimental study, twenty male and 20 female D. Melanogaster pupae were housed in test tubes with banana (5 pupae /tube).). Male and female groups each were divided into three experimental group and one control group, which were maintained at 25℃. Morphine (0.2, 0.02, 0.002 mg/ml) was added into the test tubes of the experimental groups. The control group maintained at morphine-free test tube.

AU-rich elements regulate Drosophila gene expression,19273595,10.1128/MCB.01506-08,"In mammals, AU-rich elements (AREs) are critical regulators of mRNA turnover.

We have generated a Drosophila ARE database (D-ARED) and established that about 16% of D. melanogaster genes contain the mammalian ARE signature, an AUUUA pentamer in an A/U-rich context. Using candidate ARE genes, we show that Drosophila AREs stimulate reporter mRNA decay in cultured cells and in the physiological context of the immune response in D. melanogaster. In addition, we found that the conserved ARE-binding protein Tis11 regulates temporal gene expression through ARE-mediated decay (AMD) in D. melanogaster. Our work reveals that AREs are conserved and functional cis regulators of mRNA decay in Drosophila and highlights this organism as a novel model system to unravel in vivo the contribution of AMD to various processes.",2009,"Fatima Cairrao, Anason S Halees, Khalid S A Khabar, Dominique Morello, Nathalie Vanzo"
Trade-off of ovarian lipids and total body lipids for fecundity and starvation resistance in tropical populations of Drosophila melanogaster,25223796,10.1111/jeb.12480,"In Drosophila melanogaster, clines of starvation resistance along a latitudinal gradient (south to north) have been reported in India, which matched with their cline for total body lipids (TL ). Nevertheless, producing too many reserves is likely to be costly and a trade-off might exist with life-history traits. Previous studies on starvation resistance and life-history traits of D. melanogaster have mainly focused on quantification of total body lipids, instead of separating ovarian lipids from total body lipids. In the present study, we have quantified absolute ovarian lipids (OL ) versus absolute body lipids excluding ovarian lipids (BL ) and examined associations with fecundity as well as starvation resistance in two latitudinal populations (8.34 vs. 32.43°N) of D. melanogaster. Firstly, we observed a trade-off between BL and OL that matched the trade-off of starvation resistance, longevity versus fecundity and development time in latitudinal populations of D. melanogaster. Southern populations had higher starvation resistance, more BL and lesser OL, whereas northern populations had enhanced fecundity, OL and lesser BL . Secondly, within population, starvation resistance also correlated with BL , and fecundity with OL . However, there was no correlation between starvation resistance and OL . Moreover, there was utilization of BL and nonutilization of OL under starvation stress. Therefore, resources invested for fecundity in the form of OL were independent of evolved starvation resistance in D. melanogaster. Our results suggest that a common pool of energy storage compounds (lipids) are allocated differentially between fecundity and starvation resistance and are consistent with Y-model of resource allocation.",2014,"B Kalra, R Parkash"

By using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we amplified about 1.3 kb fragment spanning intron 5-10, located in the position of Tyr kinase (TyK) domain of Dfak gene from Drosophila melanogaster species group, and observed size difference among the amplified DNA fragments from different species. Further sequencing analysis revealed that D. melanogaster and D. simulans deleted an about 60 bp of DNA fragment relative to other 7 Drosophila species, such as D. elegans, D. ficusphila, D. biarmipes, D. takahashii, D. jambulina, D. prostipennis and D. pseudoobscura, and the deleted fragment located precisely in the position of one intron. The data suggested that intron loss might have occurred in the Dfak gene evolutionary process of D. melanogaster and D. simulans of Drosophila melanogaster species group. In addition, the constructed phylogenetic tree based on the Dfak TyK domains clearly revealed the evolutionary relationships between subgroups of Drosophila melanogaster species group, and the intron loss identified from D. melanogaster and D. simulans provides a unique diagnostic tool for taxonomic classification of the melanogaster subgroup from other group of genus Drosophila.",2005,"S Jin, G A Hu, Y H Qian, L Zhang, J Zhang, G Qiu, Q T Zeng, J F Gui"

Neonicotinoid-induced pathogen susceptibility is mitigated by Lactobacillus plantarum immune stimulation in a Drosophila melanogaster model,28578396,10.1038/s41598-017-02806-w,"Pesticides are used extensively in food production to maximize crop yields. However, neonicotinoid insecticides exert unintentional toxicity to honey bees (Apis mellifera) that may partially be associated with massive population declines referred to as colony collapse disorder.

Our results suggested that the immune deficiency (Imd) pathway is necessary for D. melanogaster survival in response to IMI toxicity. IMI exposure induced alterations in the host-microbiota as noted by increased indigenous Acetobacter and Lactobacillus spp. Furthermore, sub-lethal exposure to IMI resulted in decreased D. melanogaster survival when simultaneously exposed to bacterial infection and heat stress (37 °C). This coincided with exacerbated increases in TotA and Dpt (Imd downstream pro-survival and antimicrobial genes, respectively) expression compared to controls. Supplementation of IMI-exposed D. melanogaster with Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 14917 mitigated survival deficits following Serratia marcescens (bacterial pathogen) septic infection. These findings support the insidious toxicity of neonicotinoid pesticides and potential for probiotic lactobacilli to reduce IMI-induced susceptibility to infection.",2017,"Brendan A Daisley, Mark Trinder, Tim W McDowell, Hylke Welle, Josh S Dube, Sohrab N Ali, Hon S Leong, Mark W Sumarah, Gregor Reid"
A comprehensive study of the harmful effects of ZnO nanoparticles using Drosophila melanogaster as an in vivo model,25917694,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.04.053,"This study planned to determine the range of biological effects associated with ZnO-NP exposure using Drosophila melanogaster as an in vivo model. In addition, ZnCl2 was used to determine the potential role of Zn ions alone. Toxicity, internalization through the intestinal barrier, gene expression changes, ROS production, and genotoxicity were the end-points evaluated. No toxicity or oxidative stress induction was observed in D. melanogaster larvae, whether using ZnO-NPs or ZnCl2. Internalization of ZnO-NPs through the intestinal barrier was observed. No significant changes in the frequency of mutant clones (wing-spot test) or percentage of DNA in tail (comet assay) were observed although significant changes in Hsp70 and p53 gene expression were detected. Our study shows that ZnO-NPs do not induce toxicity or genotoxicity in D. melanogaster, although uptake occurs and altered gene expression is observed.",2015,"Mohamed Alaraby, Balasubramanyam Annangi, Alba Hernández, Amadeu Creus, Ricard Marcos"
Evolutionary pathways of the tirant LTR retrotransposon in the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup of species,17390093,10.1007/s00239-006-0108-9,"Tirant, a LTR retrotransposon with copies scattered over the chromosome arms of Drosophila melanogaster, is in the process of being lost from the chromosome arms of most natural populations of the sister species D. simulans. In an attempt to clarify the dynamics and evolution of tirant, we have studied the regulatory and reverse transcriptase regions in copies of the nine closely related species of the D. melanogaster subgroup. We show that tirant is mainly vertically transmitted in these species, with the exception of a horizontal transfer event from an ancestor of D. melanogaster to D. teissieri. We propose that, in four of the species (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. mauritiana), the observed patterns of evolution of the regulatory region vary with genome constraints and with the history and biogeography of the species.",2007,"Marie Fablet, Sémi Souames, Christian Biémont, Cristina Vieira"
Contrasting patterns of X-linked and autosomal nucleotide variation in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,11230529,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003804,"Surveys of molecular variation in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans have suggested that diversity outside of Africa is a subset of that within Africa. It has been argued that reduced levels of diversity in non-African populations reflect a population bottleneck, adaptation to temperate climates, or both. Here, I summarize the available single-nucleotide polymorphism data for both species. A simple ""out of Africa"" bottleneck scenario is consistent with geographic patterns for loci on the X chromosome but not with loci on the autosomes. Interestingly, there is a trend toward lower nucleotide diversity on the X chromosome relative to autosomes in non-African populations of D. melanogaster, but the opposite trend is seen in African populations. In African populations, autosomal inversion polymorphisms in D. melanogaster may contribute to reduced autosome diversity relative to the X chromosome. To elucidate the role that selection might play in shaping patterns of variability, I present a summary of within- and between-species patterns of synonymous and replacement variation in both species. Overall, D. melanogaster autosomes harbor an excess of amino acid replacement polymorphisms relative to D. simulans. Interestingly, range expansion from Africa appears to have had little effect on synonymous-to-replacement polymorphism ratios.",2001,P Andolfatto
Drosophila simulans: A Species with Improved Resolution in Evolve and Resequence Studies,28546383,10.1534/g3.117.043349,"The combination of experimental evolution with high-throughput sequencing of pooled individuals-i.e., evolve and resequence (E&R)-is a powerful approach to study adaptation from standing genetic variation under controlled, replicated conditions. Nevertheless, E&R studies in Drosophila melanogaster have frequently resulted in inordinate numbers of candidate SNPs, particularly for complex traits. Here, we contrast the genomic signature of adaptation following ∼60 generations in a novel hot environment for D. melanogaster and D. simulans For D. simulans, the regions carrying putatively selected loci were far more distinct, and thus harbored fewer false positives, than those in D. melanogaster We propose that species without segregating inversions and higher recombination rates, such as D. simulans, are better suited for E&R studies that aim to characterize the genetic variants underlying the adaptive response.",2017,"Neda Barghi, Raymond Tobler, Viola Nolte, Christian Schlötterer"
Drosophila melanogaster mitochondrial DNA: gene organization and evolutionary considerations,3130291,,"The sequence of a 8351-nucleotide mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragment has been obtained extending the knowledge of the Drosophila melanogaster mitochondrial genome to 90% of its coding region. The sequence encodes seven polypeptides, 12 tRNAs and the 3' end of the 16S rRNA and CO III genes. The gene organization is strictly conserved with respect to the Drosophila yakuba mitochondrial genome, and different from that found in mammals and Xenopus. The high A + T content of D. melanogaster mitochondrial DNA is reflected in a reiterative codon usage, with more than 90% of the codons ending in T or A, G + C rich codons being practically absent. The average level of homology between the D. melanogaster and D. yakuba sequences is very high (roughly 94%), although insertion and deletions have been detected in protein, tRNA and large ribosomal genes. The analysis of nucleotide changes reveals a similar frequency for transitions and transversions, and reflects a strong bias against G + C on both strands. The predominant type of transition is strand specific.",1988,R Garesse
Anti-ageing effects of red ginseng on female Drosophila melanogaster,32022406,10.1111/jcmm.15029,"Red ginseng (RG) was recently reported to extend the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster. However, the mechanism underlying this effect has not yet been elucidated. The present study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the RG-mediated prolongation of the lifespan of female D melanogaster. In this study, protein changes in 36-day-old female D melanogaster were identified using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ), and levels of differentially expressed proteins were verified by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. Our studies have shown that RG concentrations of 12.5, 15 and 17.5 mg/mL significantly prolonged the lifespan. Eleven proteins were up-regulated and 46 were down-regulated between the RG and control groups; and Pebp1 expression was significantly down-regulated. In addition, AKT and p-AKT were down-regulated, and ERK, p-ERK and Raf1 were up-regulated by RG. Therefore, RG significantly prolonged the lifespan of female D melanogaster by reducing the expression of Pebp1, up-regulating ERK and inhibiting the AKT pathway. RG may be a potential drug for anti-ageing treatment.",2020,"Wei Hou, Jin Pei, YingPing Wang, Jiao Zhang, HouSheng Zheng, Ranji Cui"
Survey of malathion resistance and avermectin susceptibility in field populations of Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae) and D. simulans,9887681,10.1093/jee/91.6.1245,"Populations of Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) and Drosophila simulans (Sturtevant) from various geographic locations in North America and elsewhere were sampled to assess the distribution of malathion resistance and avermectin tolerance. Comparisons are made to previous reports of a differential response to malathion selection in these species. Results indicate that for malathion, resistance is widespread in D. simulans but varies considerably in D. melanogaster. For avermectins, although the pattern of tolerance is similar in both species, there exists a significant amount of variation in these levels between geographic regions. We consider how these different geographic patterns of resistance distribution may shed insight on the relative roles of population structure and exposure history in affecting the spread of resistance. In addition, we consider further the use of D. melanogaster and D. simulans as a model for examining the effects of insecticide exposure on sympatric populations.",1998,"M Windelspecht, R C Richmond, B J Cochrane"

P elements and the determinants of hybrid dysgenesis have different dynamics of propagation in Drosophila melanogaster populations,26530414,10.1007/s10709-015-9872-z,"Intraspecific hybrid dysgenesis (HD) appears after some strains of D. melanogaster are crossed. The predominant idea is that the movement of transposable P elements causes HD. It is believed that P elements appeared in the D. melanogaster genome in the middle of the last century by horizontal transfer, simultaneously with the appearance of HD determinants. A subsequent simultaneous expansion of HD determinants and P elements occurred. We analyzed the current distribution of HD determinants in natural populations of D. melanogaster and found no evidence of their further spread. However, full-sized P elements were identified in the genomes of all analyzed natural D. melanogaster strains independent of their cytotypes. Thus, the expansion of P elements does not correlate with the expansion of HD determinants. We found that the ovaries of dysgenic females did not contain germ cells despite the equal number of primordial germ cells in early stages in dysgenic and non-dysgenic embryos. We propose that HD does not result from DNA damage caused by P element transposition, but it would be the disruption in the regulation of dysgenic ovarian formation that causes the dysgenic phenotypes.",2015,"Olesia M Ignatenko, Lyudmila P Zakharenko, Natalia V Dorogova, Svetlana A Fedorova"
The period gene of Drosophila carries species-specific behavioral instructions,3208755,,"We have analyzed and compared the circadian locomotor activity rhythms of Drosophila melanogaster and D.pseudoobscura. The rhythms of D.pseudoobscura are stronger and the periods shorter than those of D.melanogaster. We have also transformed D.melanogaster flies with a hybrid gene containing the coding region of the D.pseudoobscura period (per) gene. Behavioral assays of flies containing this hybrid gene show that the per protein encoded by the D.pseudoobscura per gene is able to rescue the rhythmic deficiencies of arrhythmic, pero1 D.melanogaster. More important, the rhythms of some of these strains are stronger and the periods shorter than those of D.melanogaster (and those of transformants which carry the equivalent D.melanogaster per gene construct) and hence resemble those of D.pseudoobscura. The results suggest that the primary amino acid sequence of the per gene encodes species-specific behavioral instructions that are detectable when only the per gene is transferred to a different species.",1988,"G Petersen, J C Hall, M Rosbash"
Transcriptional Control of Quality Differences in the Lipid-Based Cuticle Barrier in Drosophila suzukii and Drosophila melanogaster,32849846,10.3389/fgene.2020.00887,"Cuticle barrier efficiency in insects depends largely on cuticular lipids. To learn about the evolution of cuticle barrier function, we compared the basic properties of the cuticle inward and outward barrier function in adults of the fruit flies Drosophila suzukii and Drosophila melanogaster that live on fruits sharing a similar habitat. At low air humidity, D. suzukii flies desiccate faster than D. melanogaster flies. We observed a general trend indicating that in this respect males are less robust than females in both species. Xenobiotics penetration occurs at lower temperatures in D. suzukii than in D. melanogaster. Likewise, D. suzukii flies are more susceptible to contact insecticides than D. melanogaster flies. Thus, both the inward and outward barriers of D. suzukii are less efficient. Consistently, D. suzukii flies have less cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) that participate as key components of the cuticle barrier. Especially, the relative amounts of branched and desaturated CHCs, known to enhance desiccation resistance, show reduced levels in D. suzukii. Moreover, the expression of snustorr (snu) that encodes an ABC transporter involved in barrier construction and CHC externalization, is strongly suppressed in D. suzukii. Hence, species-specific genetic programs regulate the quality of the lipid-based cuticle barrier in these two Drosophilae. Together, we conclude that the weaker inward and outward barriers of D. suzukii may be partly explained by differences in CHC composition and by a reduced Snu-dependent transport rate of CHCs to the surface. In turn, this suggests that snu is an ecologically adjustable and therefore relevant gene in cuticle barrier efficiency.",2020,"Yiwen Wang, Jean-Pierre Farine, Yang Yang, Jing Yang, Weina Tang, Nicole Gehring, Jean-François Ferveur, Bernard Moussian"
Functional conservation of a glucose-repressible amylase gene promoter from Drosophila virilis in Drosophila melanogaster,8483161,10.1007/BF00160478,"Previous studies have demonstrated that the expression of the alpha-amylase gene is repressed by dietary glucose in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we show that the alpha-amylase gene of a distantly related species, D. virilis, is also subject to glucose repression. Moreover, the cloned amylase gene of D. virilis is shown to be glucose repressible when it is transiently expressed in D. melanogaster larvae. This cross-species, functional conservation is mediated by a 330-bp promoter region of the D. virilis amylase gene. These results indicate that the promoter elements required for glucose repression are conserved between distantly related Drosophila species. A sequence comparison between the amylase genes of D. virilis and D. melanogaster shows that the promoter sequences diverge to a much greater degree than the coding sequences. The amylase promoters of the two species do, however, share small clusters of sequence similarity, suggesting that these conserved cis-acting elements are sufficient to control the glucose-regulated expression of the amylase gene in the genus Drosophila.",1993,"C Magoulas, A Loverre-Chyurlia, S Abukashawa, L Bally-Cuif, D A Hickey"

Analysis of Drosophila 4E-BP(null) mutant survival upon infection with C. albicans showed that 4E-BP plays an important role in host defense, suggesting a role for translational control in the D. melanogaster response to C. albicans infection.",2007,"A Levitin, A Marcil, G Tettweiler, M J Laforest, U Oberholzer, A M Alarco, D Y Thomas, P Lasko, M Whiteway"
Molecular genetic analysis of V-ATPase function in Drosophila melanogaster,9050231,,"V-ATPases are phylogenetically widespread, highly conserved, multisubunit proton pumps. Originally characterised in endomembranes, they have been found to energise transport across plasma membranes in a range of animal cells and particularly in certain epithelia. While yeast is the model of choice for the rapid generation and identification of V-ATPase mutants, it does not allow their analysis in a plasma membrane context. For such purposes, Drosophila melanogaster is a uniquely suitable model. Accordingly, we have cloned and characterised genes encoding several V-ATPase subunits in D. melanogaster and, using P-element technology, we have succeeded in generating multiple new alleles. Reporter gene constructs reveal ubiquitous expression, but at particularly high levels in those epithelial thought to be energised by V-ATPases, and several of the alleles have lethal recessive phenotypes characterised by epithelial dysfunction. These results, while providing the first gene knockouts of V-ATPases in animals, also illustrate the general utility of D. melanogaster as a model for the genetic analysis of ion transport and its control in epithelia.",1997,"J A Dow, S A Davies, Y Guo, S Graham, M E Finbow, K Kaiser"

The molecular mechanism of rhythm in Drosophila has been studied in detail. However, rhythm and clock genes have mostly been analyzed in Drosophila melanogaster. To confirm whether the tim gene exists and works as a clock component in other Drosophila species, we cloned a tim homolog from Drosophila ananassae that shared 85.9% similarity with Drosophila melanogaster tim at the amino acid level. In addition, the PER interaction domains and NLS were highly conserved. Introduction of the D. ananassae tim homolog rescued the rhythm of the locomotor activity of about 44% of a population of D. melanogaster tim(01) flies. At the molecular level, hs-tim introduced not only TIM but PER oscillation in transgenic flies.

Comparison of chromosomal DNA composing timeless in Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis suggests a new conserved structure for the TIMELESS protein,9365248,10.1093/nar/25.23.4710,"Two proteins, TIM and PER, physically interact to control circadian cycles of tim and per transcription in Drosophila melanogaster. In the present study the structure of TIM protein expressed by D. virilis was determined by isolation and sequence analysis of genomic DNA (gDNA) corresponding to the D. virilis tim locus (v tim ). Comparison of v tim and m tim gDNA revealed high conservation of the TIM protein. This contrasts with poor sequence conservation previously observed for the TIM partner protein PER in these species. Inspection of the v tim sequence suggests an alternative structure for most TIM proteins. Sequences forming an intron in a previously characterized D. melanogaster tim cDNA appear to be most often translated to produce a longer TIM protein in both species. The N-terminal sequence of vTIM and sequence analysis of genomic DNA from several strains of D. melanogaster suggest that only one of two possible translation initiation sites found in tim mRNA is sufficient to generate circadian rhythms in D. melanogaster. TIM translation may be affected by multiple AUG codons that appear to have been conserved in sequences composing the 5'-untranslated tim mRNA leader.",1997,"M P Myers, A Rothenfluh, M Chang, M W Young"
Neuronal susceptibility to GRIM in Drosophila melanogaster measures the rate of genetic changes that scale to lifespan,19428445,10.1016/j.mad.2009.01.002,"Gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster changes significantly throughout life and some of these changes can be delayed by lowering ambient temperature and also by dietary restriction. These two interventions are known to slow the rate of aging as well as the accumulation of damage. It is unknown, however, whether gene expression changes that occur during development and early adult life make an animal more vulnerable to death. Here we develop a method capable of measuring the rate of programmed genetic changes during young adult life in D. melanogaster and show that these changes can be delayed or accelerated in a manner that is predictive of longevity. We show that temperature shifts and dietary restriction, which slow the rate of aging in D. melanogaster, extend the window of neuronal susceptibility to GRIM over-expression in a way that scales to lifespan. We propose that this susceptibility can be used to test compounds and genetic manipulations that alter the onset of senescence by changing the programmed timing of gene expression that correlates and may be causal to aging.",2009,"Matthew A Bedoukian, Sarah M Rodriguez, Matthew B Cohen, Stuart V Duncan Smith, Jennifer Park"
Transposable element dynamics in two sibling species: Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,15088652,10.1023/b:gene.0000017635.34955.b5,"Transposable elements (TEs) in the two sibling species, Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans, differ considerably in amount and dynamics, with D. simulans having a smaller amount of TEs than D. melanogaster. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain these differences, based on the evolutionary history of the two species, and claim differences either in the effective size of the population or in genome characteristics. Recent data suggest, however, that the higher amount of TEs in D. melanogaster could be associated with the worldwide invasion of D. melanogaster a long time ago while D. simulans is still under the process of such geographical spread. Stresses due to new environmental conditions and crosses between migrating populations could explain the mobilization of TEs while the flies colonize.

We and colleagues have isolated five different strains belonging to four distinct Providencia species as natural infections of Drosophila melanogaster captured in the wild. We found that these isolates vary considerably in pathology to infected D. melanogaster, differing in the level of mortality they cause, their ability to replicate within the host and the level that the fly's immune response is elicited. One interesting bacterium was Providencia sneebia, which causes nearly complete mortality and reaches large numbers in the fly but does not elicit a comparably strong immune response. Through coinfection experiments, we determined that P. sneebia avoids recognition by the immune system. We tested for biofilm formation and replication within D. melanogaster cells as possible mechanisms for P. sneebia escape from host immunity, but did not find evidence for either.

Therefore, cuticular hydrocarbons were compared among the eight species in the D. melanogaster subgroup. For the two cosmopolitan species and several geographic strains that were studied, all males are quite similar with very abundant monoenes. The major compound in most cases is 7-tricosene. Only three exceptions were found: D. sechellia, and the Afrotropical strains of D. melanogaster and D. simulans. A significant sexual dimorphism exists in three species: D. melanogaster, D. erecta, and D. sechellia. Greater variation was observed in females than in males. D. erecta is singular in the production of long-chain molecules (31-33 carbons). Only three species (D. melanogaster, D. erecta, and D. sechellia) produce diene in significant amounts. Such products, especially 7,11-heptacosadiene, are known to act as aphrodisiacs for D. melanogaster males. In the five other species, females show only quantitative differences from males, generally with 7-tricosene as the most abundant compound. This compound is an aphrodisiac for D. simulans males. Some species such as D. yakuba, D. teissieri, D. orena, D. mauritiana, and the Seychelles strain of D. simulans are almost identical in the chemical composition of cuticular hydrocarbons.

However, some recent results appear to be flawed due to the use of not optimal control rearing conditions.

Hemocytes were isolated from the third instar larvae of both species and treated for 3h with zinc chloride solutions, containing 0.35 mM or 1.7 mM of Zn(2+), and untreated as control. Phagocytotic activity of hemocytes was examined by flow cytometry after adding latex fluorescent beads to the medium, while apoptosis was evaluated by application of annexinV-FITC and pan-caspase-FITC inhibitor. Mitochondrial viability was determined by measuring resazurin absorbancy in the cell medium. The obtained results showed that Zn(2+) increases phagocytosis and affects PCD of both species hemocytes but each in a different way. Zinc decreases fraction of annexin-positive hemocytes in M. domestica but increases it in D. melanogaster. The pan-caspase analysis revealed low and high activity of caspases in hemocytes of M. domestica and D. melanogaster, respectively. Zn(2+) also decreased the viability of hemocyte mitochondria but only in D. melanogaster.

Genetic architecture of natural variation in cuticular hydrocarbon composition in Drosophila melanogaster,26568309,10.7554/eLife.09861,"Insect cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) prevent desiccation and serve as chemical signals that mediate social interactions. Drosophila melanogaster CHCs have been studied extensively, but the genetic basis for individual variation in CHC composition is largely unknown. We quantified variation in CHC profiles in the D. melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and identified novel CHCs. We used principal component (PC) analysis to extract PCs that explain the majority of CHC variation and identified polymorphisms in or near 305 and 173 genes in females and males, respectively, associated with variation in these PCs. In addition, 17 DGRP lines contain the functional Desat2 allele characteristic of African and Caribbean D. melanogaster females (more 5,9-C27:2 and less 7,11-C27:2, female sex pheromone isomers). Disruption of expression of 24 candidate genes affected CHC composition in at least one sex.

"Divergence of the regulation of alpha-amylase activity in Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila funebris, and Drosophila saltans",10429831,10.1023/a:1018714000671,"The regulation of amylase activity in three Drosophila species, D. melanogaster, D. funebris and D. saltans, was analyzed by measuring the specific activity levels in four dietary environments, cornmeal, glucose, 5% starch, and 10% starch, at three developmental stages, i.e., the third-instar larval, pupal, and 2-day-old adult stages. The developmental profiles of amylase activity for the three Drosophila species showed that the level of activity was high at the larval and adult stages but substantially low at the pupal stage, suggesting that Drosophila does not utilize starch at the pupal stage. Divergence in the regulation of amylase was observed among the three Drosophila species on the following points. (1) The order of amylase specific activity was D. melanogaster > D. funebris > D. saltans. (2) The response pattern to the dietary environment varied among the species and changed during development. (3) The timing of the switch in the response pattern to the dietary environment during development was before pupation in D. funebris and D. saltans but after pupation in D. melanogaster. The significance of the divergence in the regulation of amylase activity for adaptation to a starch environment in Drosophila is discussed.",1999,"Y Eguchi, Y Matsuo"
Transposable element 'roo' attaches to nuclear matrix of the Drosophila melanogaster,24735214,10.1673/031.013.11101,"The genome of eukaryotes is organized into structural units of chromatin loops. This higher order organization is supported by a nuclear skeleton called the nuclear matrix. The genomic DNA associated with the nuclear matrix is called the matrix associated region (MAR). Only a few genome-wide screens have been attempted, although many studies have characterized locusspecific MAR DNA sequences. In this study, a MAR DNA library was prepared from the Drosophila melanogaster Meigen (Diptera: Drosophilidae) genome. One of the sequences identified as a MAR was from a long terminal repeat region of 'roo' retrotransposon (roo MAR). Sequence analysis of roo MAR showed its distribution across the D. melanogaster genome. roo MAR also showed high sequence similarity with a previously identified MAR in Drosophila, namely the 'gypsy' retrotransposon. Analysis of the genes flanking roo MAR insertions in the Drosophila genome showed that genes were co-ordinately expressed. The results from the present study in D. melanogaster suggest this sequence plays an important role in genome organization and function. The findings point to an evolutionary role of retrotransposons in shaping the genomic architecture of eukaryotes.",2013,"Anitha Mamillapalli, Rashmi U Pathak, Hita S Garapati, Rakesh K Mishra"
SnoRNA U21 is also intron-encoded in Drosophila melanogaster but in a different host-gene as compared to warm-blooded vertebrates,8603691,10.1016/0014-5793(95)01511-6,"U21 is an intron-encoded snoRNA in vertebrates which contains a 13-nt tract of complementarity to an invariant sequence in eukaryotic 28S rRNA.

In D. melanogaster, U21 is encoded within the ARF-1 (ADP ribosylation factor 1) gene, whereas in chicken and mammals it is found in the ribosomal protein L5 gene. In D. melanogaster, like in vertebrates, U21 is devoid of a 5' trimethylguanosine cap, thus, likely resulting from processing of intronic RNA. The only portion of U21 sequence preserved between D. melanogaster and vertebrates, in addition to the hallmark box C and box D motifs, corresponds precisely to the 13-nt complementary to rRNA, pointing to an important role of the pairing of U21 to pre-rRNA.",1996,"M H Renalier, M Nicoloso, L H Qu, J P Bachellerie"
Comparative mapping of cosmids and gene clones from a 1.6 Mb chromosomal region of Drosophila melanogaster in three species of the distantly related subgenus Drosophila,10199954,10.1007/s004120050349,"The successful hybridization of cosmid clones from Drosophila melanogaster (Sophophora subgenus) to the salivary gland chromosomes of other species as distantly related as those in the Drosophila subgenus attests their great potential for unravelling genome evolution. We have carried out, using 28 cosmids and 13 gene clones, a study of the organization of the D. melanogaster 95A-96A chromosomal region in three Drosophila subgenus species: D. repleta, D. buzzattii and D. virilis. These clones were first used to built an accurate map of this 1.6 Mb region of D. melanogaster chromosome 3R (Muller's element E). Then, they were hybridized and mapped to the homologous chromosome 2 of the other three distantly related species. The studied region is disseminated over 13 different sites of chromosome 2 in the Drosophila subgenus species, which implies a minimum of 12 inversion breakpoints fixed between the two subgenera. Extrapolation to the entire chromosome gives 90 fixed inversions. The D. melanogaster Pp1-96A-Acr96Aa segment conserved in D. repleta and D. buzzatii is longer than previously thought and is also conserved in D. virilis. In addition, three other D. melanogaster segments conserved in the three Drosophila subgenus species were found.

This is a special grade of TiO2 which is frequently omitted in nanotoxicology studies dealing with TiO2, yet it is the most relevant grade regarding oral exposure of humans. D. melanogaster larvae were exposed to 0.002 mg mL(-1), 0.02 mg mL(-1), 0.2 mg mL(-1), and 2 mg mL(-1) of TiO2 in feeding medium, and the survival, fecundity, pupation time, and expression of genes involved in oxidative stress response were monitored. TiO2 did not affect survival but significantly increased time to pupation (p < 0.001). Fecundity of D. melanogaster was unaffected by the treatment. Expression of the gene for catalase was markedly downregulated by the treatment, while the effect on the downregulation of superoxide dismutase 2 was less pronounced. After four days of dietary exposure TiO2 was present in a significant amount in larvae, but was not transferred to adults during metamorphosis. Two individuals with aberrant phenotype similar to previously described gold nanoparticles induced mutant phenotypes were detected in the group exposed to TiO2.

The effect of this combination was investigated using cDNA microarray analysis of gene expression profiles in D. melanogaster. Treatment of D. melanogaster with pyrethrum alone resulted in a large number of differentially expressed genes, principally associated with stress responses. Seven genes were identified as being commonly expressed in D. melanogaster treated with at least two of the following treatments: P. nigrum, pyrethrum or P. nigrum plus pyrethrum.

The visual difference in darkness between the eggs of wMelPop Wolbachia-infected and uninfected mosquito hosts after egg deposition led to further investigation into melanization levels of the insects. Both D. melanogaster and A. aegypti infected with wMelPop showed increased levels of melanization, especially in females. This result was also seen in D. melanogaster and Drosophila simulans infected with the closely related wMel strain. D. simulans infected with other strains of Wolbachia did not display this difference.

Different expression strategy: multiple intronic gene clusters of box H/ACA snoRNA in Drosophila melanogaster,15288778,10.1016/j.jmb.2004.06.041,"The high degree of rRNA pseudouridylation in Drosophila melanogaster provides a good model for studying the genomic organization, structural and functional diversity of box H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). Accounting for both conserved sequence motifs and secondary structures, we have developed a computer-assisted method for box H/ACA snoRNA searching. Ten snoRNA clusters containing 42 box H/ACA snoRNAs were identified from D.melanogaster. Strikingly, they are located in the introns of eight protein-coding genes. In contrast to the mode of one snoRNA per intron so far observed in all animals, our results demonstrate for the first time a novel polycistronic organization that implies a different expression strategy for a box H/ACA snoRNA gene when compared to box C/D snoRNAs in D.melanogaster. Mutiple isoforms of the box H/ACA snoRNAs, from which most clusters are made up, were observed in D.melanogaster. The degree of sequence similarity between the isoforms varies from 99% to 70%, implying duplication events in different periods and a trend of enlarging the intronic snoRNA clusters. The variation in the functional elements of the isoforms could lead to partial alternation of snoRNA's function in loss or gain of rRNA complementary sequences and probably contributes to the great diversity of rRNA pseudouridylation in D.melanogaster.",2004,"Zhan-Peng Huang, Hui Zhou, Dan Liang, Liang-Hu Qu"
Behavioral role of the sexcombs in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,411471,10.1007/BF01077448,"The sexcombs were amputated from males of three strains of Drosophila melanogaster and one strain of D. simulans in order to assess the importance of these structures in the sexual behavior of these species. In D. melanogaster the sexcombs are important in attempts to copulate with the female. Their removal delays copulation but does not suppress it entirely. Other aspects of courtship are not influenced by removal of the sexcombs. Strain differences in quanitative aspects of courtship were found, and also in the insemination rates of females by males without sexcombs. The present evidence suggests that the sexcombs are primarily structures adapted to grasping the female securely during the act of intromission.",1977,R M Cook
Components acting in localization of bicoid mRNA are conserved among Drosophila species,8070663,,"Substantial insights into basic strategies for embryonic body patterning have been obtained from genetic analyses of Drosophila melanogaster. This knowledge has been used in evolutionary comparisons to ask if genes and functions are conserved. To begin to ask how highly conserved are the mechanisms of mRNA localization, a process crucial to Drosophila body patterning, we have focused on the localization of bcd mRNA to the anterior pole of the embryo. Here we consider two components involved in that process: the exuperantia (exu) gene, required for an early step in localization; and the cis-acting signal that directs bcd mRNA localization. First, we use the cloned D. melanogaster exu gene to identify the exu genes from Drosophila virilis and Drosophila pseudoobscura and to isolate them for comparisons at the structural and functional levels. Surprisingly, D. pseudoobscura has two closely related exu genes, while D. melanogaster and D. virilis have only one each. When expressed in D. melanogaster ovaries, the D. virilis exu gene and one of the D. pseudoobscura exu genes can substitute for the endogenous exu gene in supporting localization of bcd mRNA, demonstrating that function is conserved. Second, we reevaluate the ability of the D. pseudoobscura bcd mRNA localization signal to function in D. melanogaster. In contrast to a previous report, we find that function is retained. Thus, among these Drosophila species there is substantial conservation of components acting in mRNA localization, and presumably the mechanisms underlying this process.",1994,"S K Luk, M Kilpatrick, K Kerr, P M Macdonald"
The effect of thermal stress on the mating behavior of three Drosophila species,11731970,10.1086/323327,"Selection may act on the weakest link in fitness to change how a species adapts to an environmental stress. For many species, this limitation may be reproduction. After adult Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila simulans, and Drosophila mojavensis males were exposed to varying levels of thermal stress well below those that endanger life, courtship and mating frequency declined. The regression coefficients of both courtship and mating success did not differ significantly between D. melanogaster and D. simulans males. In contrast, significant differences were present between the two cosmopolitan species and D. mojavensis. Courtship frequency decreased at a much slower rate in D. mojavensis than in D. melanogaster and D. simulans, and while heat-stressed D. mojavensis males continued to court, many did not mate. In the cosmopolitan species, courting males almost always mated successfully. Courtship behaviors, including wing waving, were observed in D. mojavensis at temperatures that prohibited flight, while flight, courtship, and mating were knocked out simultaneously in D. melanogaster. One possible explanation for decreased flight ability and courtship success may be the reduced heat shock response in the flight muscle tissue because Hsp70 expression was lowest in the thoracic tissue of both D. melanogaster and D. mojavensis.",2001,"Z J Patton, R A Krebs"

The extended longevity and improved locomotion in the AE 2.5 group were probably because of increases in the level of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase) and expression of stress resistance genes (Hsp68, l(2)efl, and Jafrac1).

One vineyard had been treated repeatedly with chlorpyrifos to control this secondary pest species; the other had never been treated with an organophosphorus compound. The LC50 to chlorpyrifos of a genetically heterogeneous line of D. melanogaster from the exposed population (Be'er Tuvia) was 99 ng/cm2, and the LC50 of a corresponding line from the unexposed population (Sde Eliahu) was 52 ng/cm2; the wild-caught lines were much more resistant than a laboratory strain, Canton-S, whose LC50 was 0.25 ng/cm2. Genetic variance for resistance existed in both natural populations but realized heritability did not differ significantly between the populations. In crosses between a highly resistant strain and several sensitive laboratory strains of D. melanogaster, resistance was dominant.

The bacterial symbiont Wolbachia induces resistance to RNA viral infections in Drosophila melanogaster,19222304,10.1371/journal.pbio.1000002,"Wolbachia are vertically transmitted, obligatory intracellular bacteria that infect a great number of species of arthropods and nematodes. In insects, they are mainly known for disrupting the reproductive biology of their hosts in order to increase their transmission through the female germline. In Drosophila melanogaster, however, a strong and consistent effect of Wolbachia infection has not been found. Here we report that a bacterial infection renders D. melanogaster more resistant to Drosophila C virus, reducing the load of viruses in infected flies. We identify these resistance-inducing bacteria as Wolbachia. Furthermore, we show that Wolbachia also increases resistance of Drosophila to two other RNA virus infections (Nora virus and Flock House virus) but not to a DNA virus infection (Insect Iridescent Virus 6). These results identify a new major factor regulating D. melanogaster resistance to infection by RNA viruses and contribute to the idea that the response of a host to a particular pathogen also depends on its interactions with other microorganisms. This is also, to our knowledge, the first report of a strong beneficial effect of Wolbachia infection in D. melanogaster.

The mean number of MDG1 and copia euchromatic hybridization sites (3 sites for each element) is drastically decreased in D. simulans in comparison with D. melanogaster (24 and 18 sites respectively). The mean number of MDG3 sites of hybridization is 5 in D. simulans against 12 in D. melanogaster. As for MDG4 both species have on the average about 2-3 euchromatic sites. The majority of MDG1 and copia and about a half of MDG3 euchromatic copies are localized in restricted number of sites (hot spots) on D. simulans polytene chromosomes. In D. melanogaster these elements are scattered along the chromosomes though there are some hot spots too. It appears that euchromatic copies of MDG1 and copia are considerably less mobile in D. simulans in contrast to D. melanogaster. Some common hot spots of retrotransposon localization in D. simulans and D. melanogaster were earlier described as intercalary heterochromatin regions in D. melanogaster. The level of interstrain variability of MDG4 hybridization sites is comparable in both species.

The Mosaic Ancestry of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel and the D. melanogaster Reference Genome Reveals a Network of Epistatic Fitness Interactions,26354524,10.1093/molbev/msv194,"North American populations of Drosophila melanogaster derive from both European and African source populations, but despite their importance for genetic research, patterns of ancestry along their genomes are largely undocumented. Here, I infer geographic ancestry along genomes of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and the D. melanogaster reference genome, which may have implications for reference alignment, association mapping, and population genomic studies in Drosophila. Overall, the proportion of African ancestry was estimated to be 20% for the DGRP and 9% for the reference genome. Combining my estimate of admixture timing with historical records, I provide the first estimate of natural generation time for this species (approximately 15 generations per year). Ancestry levels were found to vary strikingly across the genome, with less African introgression on the X chromosome, in regions of high recombination, and at genes involved in specific processes (e.g., circadian rhythm). An important role for natural selection during the admixture process was further supported by evidence that many unlinked pairs of loci showed a deficiency of Africa-Europe allele combinations between them. Numerous epistatic fitness interactions may therefore exist between African and European genotypes, leading to ongoing selection against incompatible variants. By focusing on hubs in this network of fitness interactions, I identified a set of interacting loci that include genes with roles in sensation and neuropeptide/hormone reception. These findings suggest that admixed D. melanogaster samples could become an important study system for the genetics of early-stage isolation between populations.",2015,John E Pool

Therefore five reference amino acid sites, which are informative residues for charge differences among amylase isozymes, were considered for the evolution of the isozymes in Drosophila melanogaster. The amylase isozymes in D. melanogaster can be classified into three groups, I (AMY1, AMY2, and AMY3-A), II (AMY3-B and AMY4), and III (AMY5, AMY6-A, and AMY6-B), based on the differences in the reference sites. The most primitive amylase in D. melanogaster was found to belong to Group I, most likely the AMY2 isozyme. Groups II and III could have been derived from Group I. These results were confirmed by the analysis of 38 amino acid sites with charge differences in Drosophila.",1999,"Y Matsuo, N Inomata, T Yamazaki"
Characterization of the initiation factor eIF2B and its regulation in Drosophila melanogaster,11060303,10.1074/jbc.M008041200,"Eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2B catalyzes a key regulatory step in the initiation of mRNA translation. eIF2B is well characterized in mammals and in yeast, although little is known about it in other eukaryotes. eIF2B is a hetropentamer which mediates the exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2. In mammals and yeast, its activity is regulated by phosphorylation of eIF2alpha. Here we have cloned Drosophila melanogaster cDNAs encoding polypeptides showing substantial similarity to eIF2B subunits from yeast and mammals. They also exhibit the other conserved features of these proteins. D. melanogaster eIF2Balpha confers regulation of eIF2B function in yeast, while eIF2Bepsilon shows guanine nucleotide exchange activity. In common with mammalian eIF2Bepsilon, D. melanogaster eIF2Bepsilon is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3 and casein kinase II. Phosphorylation of partially purified D. melanogaster eIF2B by glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibits its activity. Extracts of D. melanogaster S2 Schneider cells display eIF2B activity, which is inhibited by phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, showing the insect factor is regulated similarly to eIF2B from other species. In S2 cells, serum starvation increases eIF2alpha phosphorylation, which correlates with inhibition of eIF2B, and both effects are reversed by serum treatment. This shows that eIF2alpha phosphorylation and eIF2B activity are under dynamic regulation by serum. eIF2alpha phosphorylation is also increased by endoplasmic reticulum stress in S2 cells. These are the first data concerning the structure, function or control of eIF2B from D. melanogaster.",2001,"D D Williams, G D Pavitt, C G Proud"
The evolution of courtship behaviors through the origination of a new gene in Drosophila,18508971,10.1073/pnas.0800693105,"New genes can originate by the combination of sequences from unrelated genes or their duplicates to form a chimeric structure. These chimeric genes often evolve rapidly, suggesting that they undergo adaptive evolution and may therefore be involved in novel phenotypes. Their functions, however, are rarely known. Here, we describe the phenotypic effects of a chimeric gene, sphinx, that has recently evolved in Drosophila melanogaster. We show that a knockout of this gene leads to increased male-male courtship in D. melanogaster, although it leaves other aspects of mating behavior unchanged. Comparative studies of courtship behavior in other closely related Drosophila species suggest that this mutant phenotype of male-male courtship is the ancestral condition because these related species show much higher levels of male-male courtship than D. melanogaster. D. melanogaster therefore seems to have evolved in its courtship behaviors by the recruitment of a new chimeric gene.",2008,"Hongzheng Dai, Ying Chen, Sidi Chen, Qiyan Mao, David Kennedy, Patrick Landback, Adam Eyre-Walker, Wei Du, Manyuan Long"
[The DD2R gene expression level in the corpus allatum affects the fitness of female Drosophila melanogaster],22946336,,"The effect of tissue-specific suppression of the dopamine D2-like receptor gene (DD2R) in the corpus allatum (CA), the gland that synthesizes juvenile hormone (JH) on the Drosophila melanogaster resistance to heat stress has been studied. A decreased expression of the DD2R gene in the CA has been found to substantially decrease the heat stress resistance of adult transgenic female, but not male, D. melanogaster compared to the control group, this phenomenon being weakly pronounced in juvenile flies. The effect of DD2R activation on the D. melanogaster reproductive function has been estimated. It has been shown that treatment of D. melanogaster with a synthetic specific agonist of DD2R decreases the fertility, the effect being considerably stronger in adult flies than in juvenile ones. It is concluded that the change in the number of DD2Rs in CA or their activation decreases the fitness of Drosophila.",2012,"I Iu Raushenbakh, N V Faddeeva, O V Laukhina, N E Gruntenko"
Sulfite sensitivity and sulfite oxidase activity in Drosophila melanogaster,8122996,,"The relationship between sulfite oxidase (SO) and sulfite sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster is addressed. Significant improvements to the SO assay have provided an investigative tool which can be applied to further studies of this molybdoenzyme. Using the second-instar larval stage of D, melanogaster, we have shown a direct relationship between measured levels of sulfite oxidase activity and the organism's ability to withstand a sulfite challenge. Implementation of a sulfite-testing procedure confirmed the documented instability of sulfite in solution and may explain some of the conflicting results reported in the SO literature. Results of the tungstate-addition experiments confirm that Drosophila SO is a molybdoenzyme and its activity was shown to be governed by three of the four loci known to affect more than one molybdoenzyme. The ability of D. melanogaster to withstand the application of exogenous sulfites is shown to be dependent on sulfite oxidase activity.",1993,"A C Braaten, M M Bentley"
Drosophila olfactory memory: single genes to complex neural circuits,17453015,10.1038/nrn2098,"A central goal of neuroscience is to understand how neural circuits encode memory and guide behaviour. Studying simple, genetically tractable organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, can illuminate principles of neural circuit organization and function. Early genetic dissection of D. melanogaster olfactory memory focused on individual genes and molecules. These molecular tags subsequently revealed key neural circuits for memory. Recent advances in genetic technology have allowed us to manipulate and observe activity in these circuits, and even individual neurons, in live animals. The studies have transformed D. melanogaster from a useful organism for gene discovery to an ideal model to understand neural circuit function in memory.",2007,"Alex C Keene, Scott Waddell"

We created transgenic strains of Drosophila melanogaster in which the rrf-1 or ego-1 RdRp genes from C. elegans were placed under the control of the yeast GAL4 upstream activation sequence. Activation of the gene was performed by crossing these lines to flies carrying the GAL4 transgene under the control of various Drosophila enhancers. RT-PCR confirmed the successful expression of each RdRp gene.

A novel system of fertility rescue in Drosophila hybrids reveals a link between hybrid lethality and female sterility,12586709,,"Hybrid daughters of crosses between Drosophila melanogaster females and males from the D. simulans species clade are fully viable at low temperature but have agametic ovaries and are thus sterile. We report here that mutations in the D. melanogaster gene Hybrid male rescue (Hmr), along with unidentified polymorphic factors, rescue this agametic phenotype in both D. melanogaster/D. simulans and D. melanogaster/D. mauritiana F(1) female hybrids. These hybrids produced small numbers of progeny in backcrosses, their low fecundity being caused by incomplete rescue of oogenesis as well as by zygotic lethality. F(1) hybrid males from these crosses remained fully sterile. Hmr(+) is the first Drosophila gene shown to cause hybrid female sterility. These results also suggest that, while there is some common genetic basis to hybrid lethality and female sterility in D. melanogaster, hybrid females are more sensitive to fertility defects than to lethality.",2003,"Daniel A Barbash, Michael Ashburner"
A P element of Scaptomyza pallida is active in Drosophila melanogaster,1648729,10.1073/pnas.88.14.6102,"Several results suggest that P elements have recently invaded natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster after a horizontal transfer from another species. The donor species is thought to come from the willistoni group, which contains P elements very homologous to those of D. melanogaster. However, more divergent P elements are present in many other Drosophilidae species. We have analyzed such elements from Scaptomyza pallida, a species phylogenetically distant to D. melanogaster. We report here the isolation of two coding P elements from S. pallida (PS2 and PS18) that are 4% divergent from one another. At least one of these elements (PS18) is active since it is able to transpose in D. melanogaster and to mobilize a D. melanogaster defective P element, even though its nucleotide sequence is 24% divergent from the canonical P element of D. melanogaster. To our knowledge, a P element that is active and strongly divergent from the D. melanogaster P element has not been reported previously. Sequence comparison between the complete P elements of D. melanogaster and S. pallida reveals that the structural characteristics are maintained: PS2 and PS18 contain terminal inverted repeats and internal repeats very similar to those of the D. melanogaster P element. In addition, the noncoding regions cis necessary for the transposition are more conserved than the coding sequences. Two domains found in the D. melanogaster P transposase (helix-turn-helix and leucine zipper) are well conserved in the putative proteins encoded by PS2 and PS18. This study provides insights into which parts of P elements are functionally important and correlates with functional studies of the P element in D. melanogaster.",1991,"M Simonelig, D Anxolabéhère"
[The puzzle of Wolbachia spreading out through natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster],23755525,,"The endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia are widely spread in natural populations of arthropods all over the world. This phenomenon, according to the current views, may be due either to so called reproductive parasitism (modification of sexual reproduction) or to mutualistic interrelationships with the host organism, since the bacteria are transmitted transovarially. Wolbachia are extremely widespread in natural populations and laboratory lineages of Drosophila melanogaster though they do not cause any known modifications of this insect sexual reproduction that could influence the bacteria frequency in the populations. It is found out that Wolbachia effects on drosophila reproductive processes can only consist in low-level of cytoplasmic incompatibility within laboratory lineages; in natural drosophila populations even such an effect has not been detected. The attempts to explain the wide spread of Wolbachia among representatives of D. melanogaster through fitness increasing of infected individuals were not successful either. Data obtained thereupon are contradictive and the results are not versatile. Meanwhile, there are some incomplete data on the bacteria affecting drosophila sexual behavior, expression of certain genes, ferrum metabolism. It is shown that the bacteria enhance individual resistance to RNA-viruses that, under natural conditions, infect fruit flies rather frequently, but the mechanisms of the phenomenon remain uncertain as well as the commonness of the phenomenon itself. Thus, at the one hand, it can be stated that infection by Wolbachia leads to a rather complex effect on D. melanogaster while, at the other hand, the reasons behind the wide spread of Wolbachia in natural populations of D. melanogaster still remain unclear.",2013,"S V Serga, I A Kozeretskaia"
Age-specific mortality and reproduction respond to adult dietary restriction in Drosophila melanogaster,12770153,10.1016/s0022-1910(01)00138-x,"Adult dietary yeast modulates mortality rate and reproduction of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratatis capitata. In the medfly, a sugar-only diet leads to low mortality rates and reduced reproduction; addition of dietary yeast increases both mortality and egg laying. In Drosophila melanogaster low availability of dietary yeast is known to increase life span and reduce the rate of reproduction. Despite these similarities, because of differences in experimental design it remains unclear whether a common physiological mechanism modulates the effect of diet on survival. Here, we investigate how mortality rate and reproduction in D. melanogaster respond to the treatment regime used to study the medfly: no-yeast versus full diet. We find that adult medfly and D. melanogaster have opposite responses to the absence of yeast: D. melanogaster have high mortality when on no-yeast diet; when switched to full diet, D. melanogaster reduce mortality rates to the level presented by females continuously maintained on yeast. This reduction in mortality is accompanied by increased fecundity. These patterns are observed in all tested wildtype stocks, but flies made sterile by mutation in the gene oo18 RNA-binding protein (orb) lack this response. D. melanogaster, unlike medflies, appear to require adult dietary yeast to maintain maximal survival, and the capacity to assimilate yeast for somatic processes is one wildtype function of the gene orb.",2001,"T P.

The courtship song of hybrid males is identical to that of D. simulans, suggesting that X chromosome determination, known from the cross between D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis, is also possible here. Wingbeat frequency of hybrids is intermediate between that of the two parents, demonstrating that courtship song and wingbeat frequency are inherited independently of each other. In mating test, hybrid males cout and are accepted by D. simulans females more than hybrid females (presumably because their song is more ""acceptable"" to the former).

The development of larvae was arrested at the pre-wandering stage under fluctuating thermal regime (FTR), which simultaneously resulted in diminishing the accumulation of indirect chill injuries. Our physiological, metabolomic, and transcriptomic analyses revealed that compared to larvae stored at constant low temperatures, the larvae stored under FTR conditions were able to decrease the rates of depletion of energy substrates, exploited brief warm episodes of FTR for homeostatic control of metabolite levels, and more efficiently exerted protection against oxidative damage.",2016,"Vladimír Koštál, Jaroslava Korbelová, Tomáš Štětina, Rodolphe Poupardin, Hervé Colinet, Helena Zahradníčková, Iva Opekarová, Martin Moos, Petr Šimek"
Direct and correlated responses to laboratory selection for body melanisation in Drosophila melanogaster: support for the melanisation-desiccation resistance hypothesis,23239892,10.1242/jeb.076166,"For Drosophila melanogaster, cuticular melanisation is a quantitative trait, varying from no melanin to completely dark. Variation in melanisation has been linked with stress resistance, especially desiccation, in D. melanogaster and other species. As melanism has a genetic component, we selected melanic and non-melanic phenotypes of D. melanogaster in order to confirm the association of desiccation resistance and rate of water loss with cuticular melanisation previously reported for this species. A bidirectional selection experiment for dark (D1-D4) and light (L1-L4) body colour in D. melanogaster was conducted for 60 generations. We observed a 1.6-fold increase in abdominal melanisation in selected dark strains and a 14-fold decrease in selected light strains compared with control populations. Desiccation resistance increased significantly in the dark-selected morphs as compared with controls. The observed increase in desiccation resistance appeared as a consequence of a decrease in cuticular permeability. Our results show that traits related to water balance were significantly correlated with abdominal melanisation and were simultaneously selected bidirectionally along with melanisation.",2013,"Seema Ramniwas, Babita Kajla, Kapil Dev, Ravi Parkash"
RNAi validation of resistance genes and their interactions in the highly DDT-resistant 91-R strain of Drosophila melanogaster,26047118,10.1016/j.pestbp.2015.01.001,"4,4'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) has been re-recommended by the World Health Organization for malaria mosquito control. Previous DDT use has resulted in resistance, and with continued use resistance will increase in terms of level and extent. Drosophila melanogaster is a model dipteran that has many available genetic tools, numerous studies done on insecticide resistance mechanisms, and is related to malaria mosquitoes allowing for extrapolation. The 91-R strain of D. melanogaster is highly resistant to DDT (>1500-fold), however, there is no mechanistic scheme that accounts for this level of resistance. Recently, reduced penetration, increased detoxification, and direct excretion have been identified as resistance mechanisms in the 91-R strain. Their interactions, however, remain unclear. Use of UAS-RNAi transgenic lines of D. melanogaster allowed for the targeted knockdown of genes putatively involved in DDT resistance and has validated the role of several cuticular proteins (Cyp4g1 and Lcp1), cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (Cyp6g1 and Cyp12d1), and ATP binding cassette transporters (Mdr50, Mdr65, and Mrp1) involved in DDT resistance. Further, increased sensitivity to DDT in the 91-R strain after intra-abdominal dsRNA injection for Mdr50, Mdr65, and Mrp1 was determined by a DDT contact bioassay, directly implicating these genes in DDT efflux and resistance.",2015,"Kyle J Gellatly, Kyong Sup Yoon, Jeffery J Doherty, Weilin Sun, Barry R Pittendrigh, J Marshall Clark"

Interestingly, genetic distances based on the proportion of shared alleles as well as FST values suggested that the American D. melanogaster populations are more closely related to the African populations than European ones are.

Indirect evidence of alteration in the expression of the rDNA genes in interspecific hybrids between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,8569692,10.1007/BF02191828,"Crosses between Drosophila melanogaster females and D. simulans males produce viable hybrid females, while males are lethal. These males are rescued if they carry the D. simulans Lhr gene. This paper reports that females of the wild-type D. melanogaster population Staket do not produce viable hybrid males when crossed with D. simulans Lhr males, a phenomenon which we designate as the Staket phenotype. The agent responsible for this phenomenon was found to be the Staket X chromosome (Xmel, Stk). Analysis of the Staket phenotype showed that it is suppressed by extra copies of D. melanogaster rDNA genes and that the Xmel, Stk chromosome manifests a weak bobbed phenotype in D. melanogaster Xmel, Stk/0 males. The numbers of functional rDNA genes in Xmel, Stk and Xmel, y w (control) chromosomes were found not to differ significantly. Thus a reduction in rDNA gene number cannot account for the weak bobbed Xmel, Stk phenotype let alone the Staket phenotype. The rRNA precursor molecules transcribed from the Xmel, Stk rDNA genes seem to be correctly processed in both intraspecific (melanogaster) and interspecific (melanogaster-simulans) conditions. It is therefore suggested that the Xmel, Stk rDNA genes are inefficiently transcribed in the melanogaster-simulans hybrids.",1996,"B Granadino, L O Penalva, L Sánchez"

Evolution of the LINE-like I element in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup,7500938,10.1007/BF00290363,"LINE-like retrotransposons, the so-called I elements, control the system of I-R (inducer-reactive) hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. I elements are present in many Drosophila species. It has been suggested that active, complete I elements, located at different sites on the chromosomes, invaded natural populations of D. melanogaster recently (1920-1970). But old strains lacking active I elements have only defective I elements located in the chromocenter. We have cloned I elements from D. melanogaster and the melanogaster subgroup. In D. melanogaster, the nucleotide sequences of chromocentral I elements differed from those on chromosome arms by as much as 7%. All the I elements of D. mauritiana and D. sechellia are more closely related to the chromosomal I elements of D. melanogaster than to the chromocentral I elements in any species. No sequence difference was observed in the surveyed region between two chromosomal I elements isolated from D. melanogaster and one from D. simulans. These findings strongly support the idea that the defective chromocentral I elements of D. melanogaster originated before the species diverged and the chromosomal I elements were eliminated.

Variation in mobility and exercise adaptations between Drosophila species,32335730,10.1007/s00359-020-01421-x,"Locomotion and mobility have been studied extensively in Drosophila melanogaster but less is known about the locomotor capacity of other Drosophila species, while the response to chronic exercise in other species has yet to be examined.

Here, we examine baseline mobility of D. sechellia, D. simulans, and D. virilis, and their response to chronic exercise training. We found significant interspecific differences in mobility and in the response to exercise. Although there is a significant sex difference in exercise adaptations in D. melanogaster, intraspecific analysis reveals few sex differences in other Drosophila species. As octopamine has been shown to be important for exercise adaptations in D. melanogaster, we also asked if any observed differences could be attributed to baseline octopamine levels. We find that octopamine and tyramine levels have the same rank order as baseline climbing speed and endurance in males, but do not predict the response to chronic exercise in males or females. Future research should focus on determining the mechanisms responsible for the inter- and intraspecific differences in mobility and the response to exercise.",2020,"Tyler Cobb, Alyson Sujkowski, Courtney Morton, Divya Ramesh, Robert Wessells"

The evolution of an alpha-esterase pseudogene inactivated in the Drosophila melanogaster lineage,10742048,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026336,"Previous analyses of the alpha-esterase cluster of Drosophila melanogaster revealed 10 active genes and the DmalphaE4a-Psi pseudogene. Here, we reconstruct the evolution of the pseudogene from the sequences of 12 alleles from widely scattered D. melanogaster populations and single alleles from Drosophila simulans and Drosophila yakuba. All of the DmalphaE4a-Psi alleles contain numerous inactivating mutations, suggesting that pseudogene alleles are fixed in natural populations. Several lines of evidence also suggest that DmalphaE4a is now evolving without selective constraint in the D. melanogaster lineage. There are three polymorphic indels which result in frameshifts; a key nucleotide of the intron splice acceptor is polymorphic; the neutral mutation parameter is the same for replacement and silent sites; one of the nonsilent polymorphisms results in a stop codon; only 1 of the 13 replacement polymorphisms is biochemically conservative; residues that are conserved among active esterases have different states in DmalphaE4a-Psi; and there are about half as many transitional polymorphisms as transversional ones. In contrast, the D. simulans and D. yakuba orthologs DsalphaE4a and DyalphaE4a do not have the inactivating mutations of DmalphaE4a-Psi and appear to be evolving under the purifying selection typical of protein- encoding genes. For instance, there have been more substitutions in the introns than in the exons, and more in silent sites than in replacement sites. Furthermore, most of the amino acid substitutions that have occurred between DyalphaE4a and DsalphaE4a are located in sites that typically vary among active alpha-esterases rather than those that are usually conserved. We argue that the original alphaE4a gene had a function which it has lost since the divergence of the D. melanogaster and D. simulans lineages.",2000,"G C Robin, R J Russell, D J Cutler, J G Oakeshott"

Historical effective size and the level of genetic diversity in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura,3107543,10.1007/BF00498950,"We report the results of a sequential gel electrophoretic study of protein variation in Drosophila melanogaster and its comparison with D. pseudoobscura. The number of alleles and mean heterozygosity were lower in D. melanogaster than in D. pseudoobscura. On the other hand, geographical populations of Drosophila melanogaster have been shown to be much more differentiated than those of D. pseudoobscura. The results suggest that in D. melanogaster low-frequency alleles have been lost during the colonization process and that major alleles have become differentiated among populations. Population bottlenecks, due to various causes, appear to have played a significant role in the shaping of genetic variation in natural populations of many species. It is proposed that a comparison of genetic variation at homologous gene loci between related species can bring out effects of historical bottlenecks and provide an alternative approach for analyzing causes of genetic variation in natural populations.",1987,"M Choudhary, R S Singh"
A preliminary characterization of the cytosolic glutathione transferase proteome from Drosophila melanogaster,22082028,10.1042/BJ20111747,"The cytosolic GST (glutathione transferase) superfamily has been annotated in the Drosophila melanogaster genome database. Of 36 genes, four undergo alternative splicing to yield a total of 41 GST proteins. In the present study, we have obtained the 41 transcripts encoding proteins by RT (reverse transcription)-PCR using RNA template from Drosophila S2 cells, an embryonic cell line. This observation suggests that all of the annotated DmGSTs (D. melanogaster GSTs) in the proteome are expressed in the late embryonic stages of D. melanogaster. To avoid confusion in naming these numerous DmGSTs, we have designated them following the universal GST nomenclature as well as previous designations that fit within this classification. Furthermore, in the cell line, we identified an apparent processed pseudogene, gste8, in addition to two isoforms from the Delta class that have been published previously. Only approximately one-third of the expressed DmGSTs could be purified by conventional GSH affinity chromatography. The diverse kinetic properties as well as physiological substrate specificity of the DmGSTs are such that each individual enzyme displayed a unique character even compared with members from the same class.",2012,"Chonticha Saisawang, Jantana Wongsantichon, Albert J Ketterman"
'Does my Diet Affect my Perfume?' Identification and Quantification of Cuticular Compounds in Five Drosophila melanogaster Strains Maintained over 300 Generations on Different Diets,26880435,10.1002/cbdv.201500064,"Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) in Drosophila melanogaster represent the basis of chemical communication being involved in many important biological functions. The aim of this study was to characterize chemical composition and variation of cuticular profiles in five D. melanogaster strains. These strains were reared for approximately 300 generations on five diets: standard cornmeal medium and substrates prepared with apple, banana, tomato, and carrot. Differences in quantity and/or quality in CHCs were assumed as a result of activation of different metabolic pathways involved in food digestion and adaptations to the particular diet type. In total, independently of sex and strain, 66 chemical compounds were identified. In females of all strains, 60 compounds were identified, while, in males, 47 compounds were extracted. Certain new chemical compounds for D. melanogaster were found. MANOVA confirmed that CHC amounts significantly depend on sex and substrates, as well as on their interactions. Discriminant analysis revealed that flies belonging to 'apple' and 'carrot' strains exhibited the most noticeable differences in CHC repertoires. A non-hydrocarbon pheromone, cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) also contributed to the variation in the pheromone bouquet among the strains.

Thirteen probes hybridized strongly to D. virilis chromosomes, four hybridized weakly and infrequently, and seven did not hybridize. Probes representing two multigene families (beta-tubulin and yolk-protein) hybridized as would be expected if all sites had been conserved in the two species on the same chromosomal elements.

Gene silencing triggered by non-LTR retrotransposons in the female germline of Drosophila melanogaster,12807773,,"Several studies have recently shown that the activity of some eukaryotic transposable elements is sensitive to the presence of homologous transgenes, suggesting the involvement of homology-dependent gene-silencing mechanisms in their regulation. Here we provide data indicating that two non-LTR retrotransposons of Drosophila melanogaster are themselves natural triggers of homology-dependent gene silencing. We show that, in the female germline of D. melanogaster, fragments from the R1 or from the I retrotransposons can mediate silencing of chimeric transcription units into which they are inserted. This silencing is probably mediated by sequence identity with endogenous copies of the retrotransposons because it does not occur with a fragment from the divergent R1 elements of Bombyx mori, and, when a fragment of I is used, it occurs only in females containing functional copies of the I element. This silencing is not accompanied by cosuppression of the endogenous gene homologous to the chimeric transcription unit, which contrasts to some other silencing mechanisms in Drosophila. These observations suggest that in the female germline of D. melanogaster the R1 and I retrotransposons may self-regulate their own activity and their copy number by triggering homology-dependent gene silencing.",2003,"Stéphanie Robin, Séverine Chambeyron, Alain Bucheton, Isabelle Busseau"

Females receptive to remating oviposited more eggs in both species; however, the species differed in the association between remating behavior and the number and distribution of oocyte stages. We found no differences in the number of either developing eggs of different stages or mature eggs between female D. pseudoobscura that were either receptive or nonreceptive to remating. In contrast, D. melanogaster females that are receptive to remating had significantly more mature eggs in the ovaries than nonreceptive females. Nonremating females had a significantly greater number of immature, vitellogenic oocytes. These results suggest that factors associated with oogenesis are related to female remating behavior in D. melanogaster but not in D. pseudoobscura. We discuss these results in conjunction with other evidence on the role male ejaculatory components play in mediating female remating behavior.",2000,"RR Snook, YK So"

RNAi knock-down led to a dramatic decrease in female dienes and increase in monoenes paralleled with an increase in copulation latency and a decrease in courtship index and copulation attempts by the males. The desatF gene was also expressed in females from D. sechellia, rich in dienes, but not D. simulans, which produce only monoenes. When hydrocarbons were feminized in D. melanogaster males by targeted expression of the transformer gene, the expression of desatF occurred.

Antibacterial efficacy of phages against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in mice and Drosophila melanogaster,19364866,10.1128/AAC.01646-08,"Phage therapy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections has received renewed attention owing to the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance in this bacterium. Here, we isolated and characterized two new potentially lytic bacteriophages (MPK1 and MPK6), which produced large and clear plaques on P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. Based on their morphology, MPK1 belongs to the Myoviridae, while MPK6 belongs to the Podoviridae. The group B polysaccharide of lipopolysaccharide was required for infection, suggesting that their host spectra are associated with the serotypes of P. aeruginosa strains. Intramuscular and intraperitoneal administration of MPK1 and, to a lesser extent, MPK6 significantly protected mice from mortality caused by PAO1-induced peritonitis-sepsis (P < 0.01). Mice treated with either phage also had lower bacterial burdens in their livers, lungs, and spleens. The antibacterial efficacy of MPK1 and MPK6 was also evaluated based on Drosophila melanogaster systemic infection caused by P. aeruginosa, for which phages were administered by feeding. Both phages significantly delayed the PAO1-induced killing of D. melanogaster (P < 0.001), although MPK1 persisted longer than MPK6 in uninfected D. melanogaster tissue samples.

Polymorphism and Divergence of Novel Gene Expression Patterns in Drosophila melanogaster,32737121,10.1534/genetics.120.303515,"Transcriptomes may evolve by multiple mechanisms, including the evolution of novel genes, the evolution of transcript abundance, and the evolution of cell, tissue, or organ expression patterns.

In contrast to most investigations of expression evolution, we seek to provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms of novel expression patterns on a short population genetic timescale. To do so, we generated population samples of D . melanogaster transcriptomes from five tissues: accessory gland, testis, larval salivary gland, female head, and first-instar larva. We combined these data with comparable data from two outgroups to characterize gains and losses of expression, both polymorphic and fixed, in D. melanogaster We observed a large number of gain- or loss-of-expression phenotypes, most of which were polymorphic within D. melanogaster Several polymorphic, novel expression phenotypes were strongly influenced by segregating cis-acting variants. In support of previous literature on the evolution of novelties functioning in male reproduction, we observed many more novel expression phenotypes in the testis and accessory gland than in other tissues. Additionally, genes showing novel expression phenotypes tend to exhibit greater tissue-specific expression. Finally, in addition to qualitatively novel expression phenotypes, we identified genes exhibiting major quantitative expression divergence in the D. melanogaster lineage.",2020,"Julie M Cridland, Alex C Majane, Hayley K Sheehy, David J Begun"
Contrasting patterns of geographic variation in the cosmopolitan sibling species Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,3107542,10.1007/BF00498949,"An electrophoretic study was carried out to compare the geographic pattern of genetic variation in Drosophila simulans with that of its sibling species, Drosophila melanogaster. An identical set of 32 gene-protein loci was studied in four geographically distant populations of D. simulans and two populations of D. melanogaster, all originating from Europe and Africa. The comparison yielded the following results: tropical populations of D. simulans were, in terms of the number of unique alleles, average heterozygosity per locus, and percentage of loci polymorphic, more variable than conspecific-temperate populations; some loci in both species showed interpopulation differences in allele frequencies that suggest latitudinal clines; and temperate-tropical genetic differentiation between populations was much less in D. simulans than in D. melanogaster. Similar differences between these two species have previously been shown for chromosomal, quantitative, physiological, and middle-repetitive DNA variation. Estimates of Nm (number of migrants per generation) from the spatial distribution of rare alleles suggest that both species have similar levels of interpopulation gene flow. These observations lead us to propose two competing hypotheses: the low level of geographic differentiation in D. simulans is due to its evolutionarily recent worldwide colonization and, alternatively, D. simulans has a narrower niche than D. melanogaster. Geographic variation data on different genetic elements (e.g., mitochondrial DNA, two-dimensional proteins, etc.) are required before these hypotheses can be adequately tested.",1987,"R S Singh, M Choudhary, J R David"
Horizontal transfer of hobo transposable elements within the Drosophila melanogaster species complex: evidence from DNA sequencing,1331701,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040774,"The hobo family of transposable elements, one of three transposable-element families that cause hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, appears to be present in all members of the D. melanogaster species complex: D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia. Some hobo-hybridizing sequences are also found in the other members of the melanogaster subgroup and in many members of the related montium subgroup. Surveys of older isofemale lines of D. melanogaster suggest that complete hobo elements were absent prior to 50 years ago and that hobo has recently been introduced into the species by horizontal transfer. To test the horizontal transfer hypothesis, the 2.6-kb XhoI fragments of hobo elements from D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. mauritiana were cloned and sequenced. The DNA sequences reveal an extremely low level of divergence and support the conclusion that the active hobo element has been horizontally transferred into or among these species in the recent past.",1992,G M Simmons

Requirement for commissureless2 function during dipteran insect nerve cord development,24026811,10.1002/dvdy.24059,"Background:
      
    

    
      In Drosophila melanogaster, commissureless (comm) function is required for proper nerve cord development. Although comm orthologs have not been identified outside of Drosophila species, some insects possess orthologs of Drosophila comm2, which may also regulate embryonic nerve cord development. Here, this hypothesis is explored through characterization of comm2 genes in two disease vector mosquitoes.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Culex quinquefasciatus (West Nile and lymphatic filiariasis vector) has three comm2 genes that are expressed in the developing nerve cord. Aedes aegypti (dengue and yellow fever vector) has a single comm2 gene that is expressed in commissural neurons projecting axons toward the midline. Loss of comm2 function in both A. aegypti and D. melanogaster was found to result in loss of commissure defects that phenocopy the frazzled (fra) loss of function phenotypes observed in both species. Loss of fra function in either insect was found to result in decreased comm2 transcript levels during nerve cord development.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:

In order to investigate its evolutionary history, we analyzed the patterns of DNA polymorphism among the S-element copies present in a sample genome (Drosophila Genome Project). The observed levels of nucleotide diversity are significantly lower than theoretical expectations based on the neutral model. This is consistent with evidence for ongoing gene conversion among copies and for purifying selection on the elements' sequences, particularly on the terminal inverted repeats. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that the members of the S-element family can be grouped into at least two genetically differentiated clusters. The level of divergence between these clusters suggests that the S elements invaded the genome of the ancestor of D. melanogaster before the speciation of the D. melanogaster complex.

Male and female adult iafgp-expressing D. melanogaster exhibited higher survival rates compared with controls when placed at non-freezing temperatures. Increased hatching rates were evident in embryos expressing IAFGP when exposed to the cold. The TUNEL assay showed that flight muscles from iafgp-expressing female adult flies exhibited less apoptotic damage upon exposure to non-freezing temperatures in comparison to control flies.

"Drosophila melanogaster as an experimental host for study of multiplication and biology of the mycoplasma inducing the ""lethargy of coleoptera""",120120,,"The mulitplication of the mycoplasma responsible for the ""lethargy of coleoptera"" on a laboratory host, Drosophila melanogaster, was obtained on the first passage. Independant series of successive passages on D. melanogaster were performed without any apparent modifications of the properties of the microorganism. Pathogenicity for its natural host Melolontha melolontha was retained. The different forms of mycoplasma observed lead us to propose a probable cycle of development, composed of a succession of globular and rod-shaped bodies, these later being often sinuous. The infected Drosophila flies presented a reduced life span and fertility. Infection of the cephalic nervous system seems to be responsible for death. Horizontal transmission of the microorganism was not observed.",1979,"C Louis, N Plus"
Tirant: a new retrotransposon-like element in Drosophila melanogaster,8661998,,"In this paper we report a new retrotransposon-like element of Drosophila melanogaster called Tirant. This sequence is moderately repeated in the genome of this species and it has been found to be widely dispersed throughout its distribution area. From Southern blot and in situ analyses, this sequence appears to be mobile in D. melanogaster, since its chromosome location and the hybridization patterns vary among the different strains analyzed. In this way, partial sequencing of Tirant ends suggests that it is a retrotransposon, since it is flanked by two LTRs. The presence of sequences homologous to Tirant has been also investigated in 28 species of the genus Drosophila by means of Southern analyses. These sequences were only detected in species from melanogaster and obscura groups. These data suggest that ancestral sequences of Tirant appeared after the Sophophora radiation and before the divergence of those groups.",1996,"M D Moltó, N Paricio, M A López-Preciado, V F Semeshin, M J Martínez-Sebastián"
Surface structure of the compound eye of various Drosophila species and eye mutants of Drosophila melanogaster,24424475,10.1007/BF00278740,"The surface structure of the compound eyes of 6 Drosophila species and 12 eye mutants of D. melanogaster were compared by scanning electron microscopy. D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. hydei, D. funebris and D. virilis displayed hexagonal facets and differed only slightly in the distribution of bristles. D. lebanonensis displayed tetragonal facets.No obvious differences in surface structure of the eyes of colour mutants of D. melanogaster were found. Mutants with structural modifications of the eyes revealed irregular patterns of bristles, variations in bristle number and variations in facet shape, size and organization.

Evolution of gene position: chromosomal arrangement and sequence comparison of the Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis sina and Rh4 genes,1946441,10.1073/pnas.88.22.10203,"The seven in absentia (sina) gene of Drosophila encodes a nuclear protein required for normal eye development. In Drosophila melanogaster, the sina gene is located within an intron of the Rh4 opsin gene. We examine here the nucleotide sequences and chromosomal arrangements of these genes in Drosophila virilis. An interspecies comparison between D. melanogaster and D. virilis reveals that the protein-coding sequences of the sina and Rh4 genes are highly conserved, but the relative chromosomal position and structural arrangement of these genes differ between the two species. In particular, the sina and Rh4 genes are widely separated in D. virilis, and there is no intron in the Rh4 gene. Our results suggest that the Rh4 gene was translocated to another chromosomal location by a retrotransposition event.",1991,"T P Neufeld, R W Carthew, G M Rubin"
A comparative study of the enzymological features of alpha-amylase in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup,8080656,10.1266/jjg.69.251,"A comparative study was done on the enzymological features of alpha-amylase among six sibling species belonging to the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup. The pH optima were 7.6 for D. melanogaster, D. mauritiana and D. simulans and 7.4 for D. erecta, D. teissieri and D. yakuba. The temperature optima were commonly 37 C in all species studied. However, there are two types of temperature dependence; a strict one as observed in D. melanogaster, D. mauritiana and D. simulans, and a flat one as observed in D. erecta, D. teissieri and D. yakuba. These separations are consistent with the general phylogeny within this species subgroup. The substrate dependence was almost the same in all the species studied. The Vmax and Km were also estimated for each species. We found clear differences in the enzymological features between the species. Thus these differences might reflect an adaptation of the amylase enzyme system to speciation in this species subgroup.",1994,"H Shibata, T Yamazaki"

Comparative and functional studies of Drosophila species invasion by the gypsy endogenous retrovirus,11805056,,"Gypsy is an endogenous retrovirus of Drosophila melanogaster. Phylogenetic studies suggest that occasional horizontal transfer events of gypsy occur between Drosophila species. gypsy possesses infective properties associated with the products of the envelope gene that might be at the origin of these interspecies transfers. We report here the existence of DNA sequences putatively encoding full-length Env proteins in the genomes of Drosophila species other than D. melanogaster, suggesting that potentially infective gypsy copies able to spread between sexually isolated species can occur. The ability of gypsy to invade the genome of a new species is conditioned by its capacity to be expressed in the naive genome. The genetic basis for the regulation of gypsy activity in D. melanogaster is now well known, and it has been assigned to an X-linked gene called flamenco. We established an experimental simulation of the invasion of the D. melanogaster genome by gypsy elements derived from other Drosophila species, which demonstrates that these non- D. melanogaster gypsy elements escape the repression exerted by the D. melanogaster flamenco gene.",2002,"Lucine Mejlumian, Alain Pélisson, Alain Bucheton, Christophe Terzian"
Genetic variability and robustness of host odor preference in Drosophila melanogaster,18804372,10.1016/j.cub.2008.08.062,"Chemosensory stimuli play a crucial role for host selection in insects, including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila has been instrumental in unraveling the neurological basis of olfactory processing in insects. Basic knowledge regarding chemical ecology and thorough studies of olfactory preferences are still lacking to a great extent in D. melanogaster, however. We have characterized repeatable variation in olfactory preference between five classical D. melanogaster wild-type strains toward a large array of natural host odors and synthetic compounds. By recording the rate of attraction over up to 24 hr, we could compare stimuli varying in attractiveness and characterize phenotypic parameters on the basis of individual stimuli and the whole stimulus array. Behavioral differences between strains were predominantly due to variation in a single phenotypic parameter: their overall responsiveness toward optimal and suboptimal olfactory stimuli. These differences were not explained by variation in olfactory sensitivity, locomotory activity, or general vigor monitored by survival. Comparisons with three recently established wild-type strains indicated that a high behavioral threshold against accepting suboptimal olfactory stimuli is the characteristic phenotype of wild D. melanogaster.",2008,"Agnieszka Ruebenbauer, Fredrik Schlyter, Bill S Hansson, Christer Löfstedt, Mattias C Larsson"
A Comprehensive Study of Genic Variation in Natural Populations of Drosophila melanogaster. I. Estimates of Gene Flow from Rare Alleles,17246368,,"In order to assess the evolutionary significance of molecular variation in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster, we have started a comprehensive genetic variation study program employing a relatively large number of gene-protein loci and an array of populations obtained from various geographic locations throughout the world. In this first report we provide estimates of gene flow based on the spatial distributions of rare alleles at 117 gene loci in 15 worldwide populations of D. melanogaster . Estimates of Nm (number of migrants exchanged per generation among populations) range from 1.09 in East-Asian populations (Taiwan, Vietnam and Australia) to 2.66 in West-Coast populations of North America. These estimates, among geographic populations separated by hundreds or even thousands of miles, suggest that gene flow among neighboring populations of D. melanogaster is quite extensive. This means that, for selectively neutral genes, we should expect little differentiation among neighboring populations. A survey of eight West-Coast populations of D. melanogaster (geographically comparable to Drosophila pseudoobscura) showed that in spite of extensive gene flow, populations of D. melanogaster show much more geographic differentiation than comparable populations of D. pseudoobscura. From this we conclude that migration in combination with natural selection rather than migration alone is responsible for the geographic uniformity of molecular polymorphisms in D. pseudoobscura.",1987,"R S Singh, L R Rhomberg"
Mutation frequencies of Drosophila melanogaster reared in glass and plastic vials,6419398,10.1016/0378-4274(83)90262-x,"The mutation frequency of the sex-linked recessive lethal assay resulting from the examination of 9032 tests of Drosophila melanogaster reared in plastic vials (0.198%) was approximately twice that of Drosophila melanogaster reared in glass vials (0.085%) after examination of 9365 tests. This difference was found to be significant (P less than 0.05). This significant increase in the mutation frequency may be due to styrene which is one of the components of the plastic vials. Also, the frequency of failure was greater when using plastic vials (1.19%) compared to glass vials (0.71%). In the following study we examined D. melanogaster SLRL mutation frequencies and failure rates when using glass and plastic vials. Our results showed a doubling in the SLRL mutation rate.",1983,"R A Wirtz, N R Powers"

Hybrid males from special reciprocal crosses did not differ. While D. melanogaster and D. simulans males differed markedly for the majority of transitions studied, hybrid males showed no consistent pattern with the parent species, being indistinguishable from D. simulans males, indistinguishable from D. melanogaster, or intermediate between them, depending on the trait observed. This suggests independent genetic control of these transitions during male courtship.",1980,"D Wood, J M Ringo, L L Johnson"

Complex developmental regulation of the Drosophila affinidisjuncta alcohol dehydrogenase gene in Drosophila melanogaster,3119402,10.1016/0012-1606(88)90059-0,"During development, the alcohol dehydrogenase genes of Drosophila melanogaster and D. affinidisjuncta are expressed in similar, yet distinct, tissue- and stage-specific patterns. Transcripts from both of these genes arise from two promoters (distal and proximal) that also display tissue and stage specificity. We used P-element-mediated transformation to introduce the D. affinidisjuncta Adh gene into the germ line of D. melanogaster. We show that the D. affinidisjuncta Adh gene is expressed at comparable overall levels in both species and that the tissue- and stage-specific expression for this gene (including promoter utilization) is similar in the donor and the host species. However, in some details, the expression of the D. affinidisjuncta gene in D. melanogaster resembles the host pattern, and one novel tissue-specific expression phenotype is displayed by transformants. In general, our results suggest that there has been strong conservation of cis- and trans-acting regulatory factors since the divergence of the two species but that this conservation has not been perfect.",1988,"M D Brennan, W J Dickinson"
Is esterase-P encoded by a cryptic pseudogene in Drosophila melanogaster?,8978040,,"We have amplified and sequenced the gene encoding Esterase-P (Est-P) in 10 strains of Drosophila melanogaster. Three premature termination codons occur in the coding region of the gene in two strains. This observation, together with other indirect evidence, leads us to propose that Est-P may be a pseudogene in D. melanogaster. Est-P would be a ""cryptic"" pseudogene, in the sense that it retains intact the coding sequence (without stop codons and other alterations usually observed in pseudogenes) in most D. melanogaster strains. We conjecture that the beta-esterase cluster may consist in other Drosophila species of functional and nonfunctional genes. We also conjecture that the rarity of detected pseudogenes in Drosophila may be due to the difficulty of discovering them, because most of them are cryptic.",1996,"E S Balakirev, F J Ayala"
Flounder antifreeze protein synthesis under heat shock control in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster,3037350,10.1128/mcb.7.6.2188,"The gene coding for the most abundant antifreeze protein (AFP) in the winter flounder was placed downstream of the Drosophila melanogaster hsp70 promoter and introduced into the D. melanogaster germ line by P-element-mediated transformation. In each of six transgenic strains tested, heat shock treatment induced the expression of two major AFP gene transcripts and one minor one. All three transcripts were spliced despite the lack of an obvious D. melanogaster internal intron-splicing sequence. The variation in transcript length was caused by selection of different polyadenylation sites. Western blots showed the presence of immunoreactive AFP in hemolymph from heat-shocked transformants. The immunoreactive material had a molecular weight of 6,200, which is consistent with the loss of the signal sequence from the primary translation product and the retention of the pro sequence. Thus, all the signals for flounder pre-mRNA and preprotein processing were recognized in D. melanogaster.",1987,"D E Rancourt, V K Walker, P L Davies"

The Neor transfectants stably carried both plasmids as tandem oligomers integrated in the chromosome and virus-like particles (VLP) were produced specifically in the transfectants that received the copia plasmid. The particles were quite similar in various aspects such as size, morphology, density, RNA content and molecular weight of the major protein component, to retrovirus-like particles (RVLP) that spontaneously appear in cultured cells of D. melanogaster: the reverse transcriptase activity however seemed to be low compared to that of the D. melanogaster RVLP.

Molecular evolution in the Drosophila yakuba period locus,1702156,10.1007/BF02106054,"Two nuclear genes from Drosophila yakuba were cloned, the orthologue of the Drosophila melanogaster period (per) clock gene and the orthologue of an unnamed D. melanogaster gene adjacent to per, which encodes a 0.9-kb RNA transcript. The DNA and presumed protein sequences of both genes are presented and compared with their orthologues in D. melanogaster. Consistent with the per orthologues described in other Drosophila species, some parts of the per gene have accumulated nonsynonymous substitutions at a much higher rate than others. This contrasts markedly with the evenly distributed amino acid replacements observed in the protein encoded by the adjacent gene. The level of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions between D. yakuba and D. melanogaster per were compared in small subsections across the gene. The results suggest that the divergence observed in the less well-conserved regions of the per protein is principally due to reduced selective constraint, although the limitations of the method used prevent positive selection acting upon a small proportion of sites being ruled out. The level of silent substitution observed in both of these nuclear genes is very similar to the level of silent substitution previously reported between D. melanogaster and D. yakuba mitochondrial genes, confirming several indirect studies, which have suggested that, in contrast to the case in mammals, silent sites are evolving at similar rates in mitochondrial and nuclear genes of Drosophila.",1990,"J R Thackeray, C P Kyriacou"

Natural hyperthermia and expression of the heat shock protein Hsp70 affect developmental abnormalities in Drosophila melanogaster,28308320,10.1007/s004420050935,"We demonstrate that natural heat stress on wild larval Drosophila melanogaster results in severe developmental defects in >10% of eclosing adults, and that increased copy number of the gene encoding the major inducible heat shock protein of D. melanogaster, Hsp70, is sufficient to reduce the incidence of such abnormalities. Specifically, non-adult D. melanogaster inhabiting necrotic fruit experienced severe, often lethal heat stress in natural settings. Adult flies eclosing from wild larvae that had survived natural heat stress exhibited severe developmental anomalies of wing and abdominal morphology, which should dramatically affect fitness. The frequency of developmental abnormalities varied along two independent natural thermal gradients, exceeding 10% in adults eclosing from larvae developing in warm, sunlit fruit. When exposed to natural heat stress, D. melanogaster larvae with the wild-type number of hsp70 genes (n=10) developed abnormal wings significantly more frequently than a transgenic sister strain with 22 copies of the hsp70 gene.",1999,"S P Roberts, M E Feder"

Comparison of bicoid-dependent regulation of hunchback between Musca domestica and Drosophila melanogaster,9376318,10.1016/s0925-4773(97)00100-7,"Co-evolution between developmental regulatory elements is an important mechanism of evolution. This work compares the hunchback-bicoid interaction in the housefly Musca domestica with Drosophila melanogaster. The Musca HUNCHBACK protein is 66% conserved and partially rescues a hunchback mutant, yet the BICOID-dependent promoter (P2) of Musca hunchback is unexpectedly diverged from D. melanogaster. Introduced into D. melanogaster, this promoter drives a normal P2 pattern during the syncytial blastoderm stage but is expressed ectopically at the anterior pole of the embryo at later stages. We also report differences in the early expression of hunchback in Musca. We suggest that conservation of the morphogenetic function of bicoid in different sized embryos of higher diptera requires co-evolution of bicoid and its target binding sites.",1997,"F Bonneton, P J Shaw, C Fazakerley, M Shi, G A Dover"

In this paper, data on the MR-active chromosomes in natural populations of D. melanogaster from Russia and neighboring countries from 1977 to 1992 are presented. The frequencies of MR chromosomes in Eurasian populations were shown to be similar to those in North America.

These data will provide a rich resource for future bioinformatics analyses of transcriptional regulation in Drosophila such as constructing motif models, training cis-regulatory module detectors, benchmarking alignment tools and continued text mining of the extensive literature on transcriptional regulation in this important model organism.

The distribution and frequency of microsatellite loci in Drosophila melanogaster,9465417,10.1046/j.1365-294x.1998.00304.x,"We report the results of a comprehensive search of Drosophila melanogaster DNA sequences in GenBank for di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeats of more than four repeat units, and a DNA library screen for dinucleotide repeats. Dinucleotide repeats are more abundant (66%) than tri- (30%) or tetranucleotide (4%) repeats. We estimate that 1917 dinucleotide repeats with 10 or more repeat units are present in the euchromatic D. melanogaster genome and, on average, they occur once every 60 kb. Relative to many other animals, dinucleotide repeats in D. melanogaster are short. Tri- and tetranucleotide repeats have even fewer repeat units on average than dinucleotide repeats. Our WorldWide Web site (http://www.bio.cornell.edu/genetics/aquadro/+ ++aquadro.html) posts the complete list of 1298 microsatellites (> or = five repeat units) identified from the GenBank search.

Impaired Geotaxis as a Novel Phenotype of Nora Virus Infection of Drosophila melanogaster,32802552,10.1155/2020/1804510,"Nora virus (NV) is a picorna-like virus that contains a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. The virus infects Drosophila melanogaster with no known characterized phenotype. In this study, geotaxis assays and longevity analyses were used to determine if Nora virus infection affects D. melanogaster's locomotor ability. In addition, Drosophila C virus (DCV), a well-characterized D. melanogaster virus, was used as a positive control, as it has previously shown a locomotor defect in infected flies. Stocks infected with NV (NV+) and DCV (DCV+) and virus-free (NV-/DCV-) stocks were established. Over a 3-year period, approximately 2,500 virgin female flies were tested for geotaxis and longevity using Kaplan-Meier analyses, as well as the Cox Proportional Hazards regression for survivorship. There was a significant decrease in the geotaxis when the D. melanogaster flies were infected with Nora virus compared to uninfected controls, but no difference was found between DCV+ and NV+ trials. There were not significant differences in longevity between the three groups. This is the first time that a phenotype has been recorded in association with Nora virus infection. Overall, the data demonstrate that geotaxis dysfunction may be a phenotypic hallmark of Nora virus infection.",2020,"Abigail Rogers, Lesley Towery, Amanda McCown, Kimberly A Carlson"
Determination of the effects of genistein on the longevity of Drosophila melanogaster meigen (Diptera; Drosophilidae),21127834,10.1007/s00128-010-0159-x,"In this study, the effects of genistein on the longevity of Drosophila melanogaster were investigated. The effects of different concentrations of genistein (1, 3, 5 and 10 μM/100 mL medium) were separately administered one by one to female and male populations of D. melanogaster for application groups. In the control group, the maximum life span was determined to be 57 days for ♀♀, 46 for ♂♂. The maximum life span for the lowest (1.0 μL) and highest (10.0 μL) application groups among the adult populations of D. melanogaster subjected to genistein were observed to be 54, 50, 40 and 36 days for ♀♀ and 51, 48, 40 and 33 days for ♂♂.

Evidence for horizontal transmission of the mobile element jockey between distant Drosophila species,1701254,10.1073/pnas.87.23.9216,We addressed the possibility of the horizontal transfer of long interspersed element (LINE)-like mobile elements by studying the distribution of the Drosophila melanogaster LINE-like element jockey in different Drosophila species. Outside the D. melanogaster group jockey was detected only in the distantly related species Drosophila funebris. Cloning and sequencing of this element from D. funebris revealed the existence of the two open reading frames highly similar to those of jockey from D. melanogaster. Elements from both species are transcriptionally active and contain in their promoter regions a conserved sequence important for its activity. The high degree of similarity between the D. melanogaster and the D. funebris jockey and the absence of jockey from other sibling species of the D. funebris group provide evidence for the horizontal transmission of jockey into D. funebris.,1990,"L J Mizrokhi, A M Mazo"

Thus far, there are no articles on characterization of Drosophila melanogaster α-CAs. Data from invertebrate CA studies may provide opportunities for anti-parasitic drug development because α-CAs are found in many parasite or parasite vector invertebrates. We have expressed and purified D. melanogaster CAH1 and CAH2 as proteins of molecular weights 30kDa and 28kDa. CAH1 is cytoplasmic whereas CAH2 is a membrane-attached protein. Both are highly active enzymes for the CO2 hydration reaction, being efficiently inhibited by acetazolamide. CAH2 in the eye of D. melanogaster may provide a new animal model for CA-related eye diseases. A series of dithiocarbamates were also screened as inhibitors of these enzymes, with some representatives showing inhibition in the low nanomolar range.",2013,"Leo Syrjänen, Martti E E Tolvanen, Mika Hilvo, Daniela Vullo, Fabrizio Carta, Claudiu T Supuran, Seppo Parkkila"
Structure and regulation of the fushi tarazu gene from Drosophila hydei,28306077,10.1007/BF00357762,"The Drosophila melanogaster segmentation gene fushi tarazu (ftz) encodes a homeodomain-type transcription factor involved in the control of larval pattern formation. Loss of function mutations cause an embryonic lethal, pair-rule phenotype. The segmentation defects, but not the lethality, can be partially rescued by the ftz orthologue from Drosophila hydei. In this work, the primary structure, expression and regulation of the D. hydei ftz gene was characterized. Sequence comparisons classify ftz as a rather fast evolving gene. However, since the homeodomain of the D. hydei FTZ protein is highly similar to that of D. melanogaster, proper regulation of D. melanogaster ftz downstream genes would be expected. In D. melanogaster embryos, a D. hydei ftz transgene is expressed normally, independent of endogenous ftz gene activity, suggesting that D. hydei ftz regulatory sequences are correctly recognized by D. melanogaster transcription factors. Accordingly, lacZ fusion constructs driven by the D. hydei ftz upstream element are expressed normally in D. melanogaster embryos. Altogether, the similarities between the two ftz orthologues by far outweigh the differences. The limited success of the trans-species rescue might be, therefore, a consequence of the accumulation of too many subtle changes in gene function, exceeding the limits of developmental plasticity during fly embryogenesis.",1995,"Wolfgang Jost, Yan Yu, Leslie Pick, Anette Preiss, Dieter Maier"
Cloning and functional characterization of the intersex homologous gene in the pest lepidopteron Maruca vitrata,19598123,10.1387/ijdb.082840dc,"The intersex (ix) gene works in concert with doublesex (dsx) at the bottom of the sex-determination hierarchy to control somatic sexual differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster females. Here we report the isolation and characterization of the Drosophila intersex (ix) homologue in the pest lepidopteron Maruca vitrata (Mvix). The Mvix gene exhibits major complexity with respect to the Drosophila homolog. It is expressed in males and females and its pre-mRNA is subject to differential splicing events which affect both the protein coding and the non-coding regions. Moreover, Northern blot experiments revealed the presence of a female-specific transcript in pupae RNA, which appears to be the first described sex specific transcript of ix homologs characterized to date. The expression of Mvix cDNA in D.melanogaster transgenic flies indicates that the MvIX product, which shares a relatively high degree of homology with the D.melanogaster IX protein, is able to partially rescues the Drosophila mutant phenotype.",2009,"Daniela Cavaliere, Francesca Di Cara, Lino C Polito, Filomena Anna Digilio"
Characterisation of Drosophila thrombospondin defines an early origin of pentameric thrombospondins,12691755,10.1016/s0022-2836(03)00248-1,"Thrombospondins (TSPs) are multidomain oligomers that have complex roles in cell interactions and tissue organisation. The five vertebrate TSPs comprise two subgroups, A and B, that are assembled as trimers or pentamers, respectively. An invertebrate TSP was recently discovered in Drosophila melanogaster, but there is no knowledge of the oligomerisation status or properties of this molecule. We developed by bioinformatics a new dataset containing the single TSP of Drosophila melanogaster and four other newly identified invertebrate TSPs to examine the phylogenetic relationships of TSPs. These analyses clearly indicate pentamerisation as an early attribute of TSPs. We demonstrate experimentally that D.melanogaster TSP is assembled as a pentamer, has heparin-binding activity and is a component of extracellular matrix (ECM). During embryogenesis, the TSP transcript is concentrated at muscle attachment sites and is expressed by a subset of myoblasts and in imaginal discs. These novel results establish TSPs as highly conserved ECM components in both invertebrates and vertebrates and open fresh perspectives on the conservation of structure and biological function within this family.",2003,"Josephine C Adams, Raymond Monk, Amanda L Taylor, Suat Ozbek, Nora Fascetti, Stefan Baumgartner, Juergen Engel"
Absence of protein polymorphism in the Ras genes of Drosophila melanogaster,10552039,10.1007/pl00006579,"Sequence analysis of 27 alleles of each of the three Ras-related genes in Drosophila melanogaster indicates that they all have low levels of polymorphism but may experience slightly different evolutionary pressures. No amino acid replacement substitutions were indicated in any of the sequences, or in the sibling species D. simulans and D. mauritiana. The Dras1 gene, which is the major ras homologue in Drosophila, has less within-species variation in D. melanogaster relative to the amount of divergence from the sibling species than does Dras2, although the contrast was not significant by the HKA test. Dras2 appears to be maintaining two classes of haplotype in D. melanogaster, one of which is closer to the alleles observed in the sibling species, suggesting that this is not likely to be a pseudogene despite the absence of a mutant phenotype. Although differences in level of expression may affect the function of the genes, it is concluded that genetic variation in the Ras signal transduction pathways cannot be attributed to catalytic variation in the Ras proteins.",1999,"R Gasperini, G Gibson"

Chromosomal analysis of gregarious oviposition by Drosophila melanogaster,8024536,10.1007/BF01067823,The contribution of different chromosomes to variation in the gregarious oviposition behavior of Drosophila melanogaster females was elucidate by a chromosome substitution analysis. Lines of D. melanogaster previously selected for more than 190 generations for high or low levels of gregarious oviposition were crossed to a tester strain having genetically marked inversion-containing chromosomes. Genes influencing gregarious oviposition behavior are distributed over chromosome II and III. Interactions among the chromosomes were negligible as measured in this experiment. The differences in the gregarious oviposition performance of these two selected lines is due mainly to the accumulation of factors for high gregarious oviposition on chromosomes II and factors for low gregarious oviposition on chromosome III.,1994,"D G Ruiz-Dubreuil, N Köhler"
Influence of mating experience on mating latency and copulation duration in Drosophila melanogaster females,19705753,,"Two important components of mating behavior, mating latency and duration of copulation, were examined during first and second mating in D. melanogaster females. Our results confirm the published findings of lower receptivity of previously mated D. melanogaster females, since fertilized females present significantly longer mating latencies. Duration of copulation also depends on female mating experience, as naive females copulated significantly longer than those previously mated. An important role of female D. melanogaster in the control of both examined components of mating behavior is displayed in the course of second mating, as part of behavioral and physiological changes induced by the first mating.",2009,"S Pavković-Lucić, V Kekić"

Larval reaction to alcohol as an indicator of resource utilization differences between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans,28309429,10.1007/BF00345417,"Newly hatched larvae of Drosophila melanogaster derived from southern Australian populations (37-38° S) have a strong preference for agar containing alcohol, while larvae of sympatric populations of Drosophila simulans show no initial preference. The alcohol preference of a more northern D. melanogaster population (10° S) is lower due to a high level of variability among isofemale strains. This agree with the general principle of decreasing biological diversity with increasing latitude, and is shown here for a simple behavioural trait with a chemical basis. The results are of application to the ecological biology of resource utilization in the wild.",1977,P A Parsons

Mechanisms regulating the copy numbers of six LTR retrotransposons in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster,12068968,10.1007/s00412-001-0174-0,"There has been debate over the mechanisms that control the copy number of transposable elements in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Target sites in D. melanogaster populations are occupied at low frequencies, suggesting that there is some form of selection acting against transposable elements. Three main theories have been proposed to explain how selection acts against transposable elements: insertions of a copy of a transposable element are selected against; chromosomal rearrangements caused by ectopic exchange between element copies are selected against; or the process of transposition itself is selected against. The three theories give different predictions for the pattern of transposable element insertions in the chromosomes of D. melanogaster. We analysed the abundance of six LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons on the X and fourth chromosomes of multiple strains of D. melanogaster, which we compare with the predictions of each theory. The data suggest that no one theory can account for the insertion patterns of all six retrotransposons. Comparing our results with earlier work using these transposable element families, we find a significant correlation between studies in the particular model of copy number regulation supported by the proportion of elements on the X for the different transposable element families. This suggests that different retrotransposon families are regulated by different mechanisms.",2002,"Martin Carr, Judith R Soloway, Thelma E Robinson, John F Y Brookfield"

Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of the D. melanogaster and D. virilis rough proteins reveals that domains of high conservation, including the homeodomain, are interspersed with highly diverged regions. Stretches of significant sequence conservation are also observed in the 5' promoter region and in the introns. The D. virilis rough gene rescues the rough mutant phenotype and is properly regulated when introduced into the D. melanogaster genome. Thus the rough protein as well as the cis-regulatory elements that ensure proper temporal and spatial regulation are functionally conserved between these Drosophila species.",1990,"U Heberlein, G M Rubin"
Meta-analysis of Diets Used in Drosophila Microbiome Research and Introduction of the Drosophila Dietary Composition Calculator (DDCC),32371452,10.1534/g3.120.401235,"Nutrition is a major factor influencing many aspects of Drosophila melanogaster physiology. However, a wide range of diets, many of which are termed ""standard"" in the literature, are utilized for D. melanogaster research, leading to inconsistencies in reporting of nutrition-dependent phenotypes across the field.

Here, we performed a meta-analysis of diets used in fly microbiome research and provide a web-based tool for researchers to determine the nutritional content of diets of interest.

The introduction of this P element into D. hawaiiensis provides an opportunity to study the behavior of the transposable element in a novel context. Germ-line transposition and numerical increase of the P elements are readily detected in D. hawaiiensis.

Cuticular Hydrocarbon Content that Affects Male Mate Preference of Drosophila melanogaster from West Africa,22536539,10.1155/2012/278903,"Intraspecific variation in mating signals and preferences can be a potential source of incipient speciation. Variable crossability between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans among different strains suggested the abundance of such variations. A particular focus on one combination of D. melanogaster strains, TW1(G23) and Mel6(G59), that showed different crossabilities to D. simulans, revealed that the mating between females from the former and males from the latter occurs at low frequency. The cuticular hydrocarbon transfer experiment indicated that cuticular hydrocarbons of TW1 females have an inhibitory effect on courtship by Mel6 males. A candidate component, a C25 diene, was inferred from the gas chromatography analyses. The intensity of male refusal of TW1 females was variable among different strains of D. melanogaster, which suggested the presence of variation in sensitivity to different chemicals on the cuticle.

During this period we sampled flies every 6h and measured their ability to survive heat and cold shock. There was a significant positive correlation between field temperature and heat shock survival and a significant negative correlation between field temperature and cold shock survival indicating that D. melanogaster are constantly adapting to their surrounding environment. The results also suggest that heat and cold resistance are obtained at a cost as these two traits were negatively correlated.",2008,"Johannes Overgaard, Jesper G Sørensen"

Bacteria from these sequence libraries were grouped into 74 distinct taxa, spanning the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes, which were unevenly spread across host populations. Summed across populations, the distribution of abundance of genera was closely fit by a power law. We observed differences among host population locations both in bacterial community richness and in composition.

The effect of cryopreservation on the lethal mutation rate in Drosophila melanogaster,9290323,10.1017/s0016672397002760,"Although cryopreservation is routinely used for the storage of a range of biological organisms, few studies have been conducted to determine whether cryopreservation increases the frequency of mutation. A procedure for the cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster embryos has recently been developed. Cryopreservation of D. melanogaster is of special interest to geneticists and evolutionary biologists because it would make it possible to assay control and experimental populations simultaneously during long-term studies. Before cryopreserved embryos can be used for such studies, it is first necessary to show that cryopreservation is not mutagenic. We tested for mutagenic effects or cryopreservation in D. melanogaster embryos with an X-linked, recessive lethal assay. The mutation rates of cryopreserved and control flies were not significantly different. We can be 95% certain that cryopreservation does not increase mutation by a factor greater than 2.39. This is the first quantitative estimate of the mutagenic effect of cryopreservation on the germ line of a metazoan.

These proteins are uncharacterized in response to Nora virus. We hypothesize that Nora virus is circulating in the hemolymph of Nora virus-infected D. melanogaster, allowing for migration beyond the primary site of replication in the gut. Analysis by qRT-PCR demonstrated biphasic viral load and corresponding vago and vir-1 transcription levels, suggesting transcription of vago and vir-1 occurs in response to viral infection. However, Vir-1 is also present in virus-free D. melanogaster suggesting basal expression or alternative functions. Presence of Nora virus RNA and the Viral Protein 4b (VP4b), in hemolymph of infected D. melanogaster supports the hypothesized circulation of Nora virus in the hemolymph. The study suggests that impaired locomotor function may be due to transport of Nora virus from the gut to the brain via the hemolymph.",2020,"Amanda Macke, Wilfredo Lopez, Darby J Carlson, Kimberly A Carlson"
The unexpected recovery of hybrids in a Drosophila species cross: a genetic analysis,8919886,10.1017/s0016672300033437,"The species cross between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans was first described by Sturtevant in the 1920s. According to his description, the hybridization of D. simulans females and D. melanogaster males produces only (or almost only) male progeny. Female hybrids are embryonic lethal. Here it is shown that these traditional results no longer hold. Instead, D. simulans is polymorphic for factor(s) that qualitatively affect the outcome of species crosses to D. melanogaster. Remarkably, many, if not most, strains of D. simulans produce abundant female hybrids when crossed to D. melanogaster males. Genetic analysis of the difference between D. simulans strains that produce many versus few hybrid females shows that recovery of hybrid females depends on autosomal, maternally acting gene(s).",1996,H A Orr
Drosophila virilis has long and highly polymorphic microsatellites,11070052,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026263,"Comparative genomics is a powerful approach to inference of the dynamics of genome evolution. Most information about the evolution of microsatellites in the genus Drosophila has been obtained from Drosophila melanogaster. For comparison, we collected microsatellite data for the distantly related species Drosophila virilis. Screening about 0.5 Mb of nonredundant genomic sequence from GenBank, we identified 239 dinucleotide microsatellites. On average, D. virilis dinucleotides were significantly longer than D. melanogaster microsatellites (7.69 repeats vs. 6.75 repeats). Similarly, direct cloning of microsatellites resulted in a higher mean repeat number in D. virilis than in D. melanogaster (12.7 repeats vs. 12.2 repeats).

Lack of polymorphism on the Drosophila fourth chromosome resulting from selection,1686006,,"Evolutionary processes can be inferred from comparisons of intraspecific polymorphism and interspecific divergence. We sequenced a 1.1-kb fragment of the cubitus interruptus Dominant (ciD) locus located on the nonrecombining fourth chromosome for ten natural lines of Drosophila melanogaster and nine of Drosophila simulans. We found no polymorphism within D. melanogaster and a single polymorphism within D. simulans; divergence between the species was about 5%. Comparison with the alcohol dehydrogenase gene and its two flanking regions in D. melanogaster, for which comparable data are available, revealed a statistically significant departure from neutrality in all three tests. This lack of polymorphism in the ciD locus may reflect recent positive selective sweeps on the fourth chromosome with extreme hitchhiking generated by the lack of recombination. By simulation, we estimate there to be a 50% chance that the selective sweeps occurred within the past 30,000 years in D. melanogaster and 75,000 in D. simulans.",1991,"A J Berry, J W Ajioka, M Kreitman"

The evolutionary arms race between transposable elements and piRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster,31992188,10.1186/s12862-020-1580-3,"Background:
      
    

    
      The piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that specifically repress transposable elements (TEs) in the germline of Drosophila. Despite our expanding understanding of TE:piRNA interaction, whether there is an evolutionary arms race between TEs and piRNAs was unclear.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here, we studied the population genomics of TEs and piRNAs in the worldwide strains of D. melanogaster. By conducting a correlation analysis between TE contents and the abundance of piRNAs from ovaries of representative strains of D. melanogaster, we find positive correlations between TEs and piRNAs in six TE families. Our simulations further highlight that TE activities and the strength of purifying selection against TEs are important factors shaping the interactions between TEs and piRNAs. Our studies also suggest that the de novo generation of piRNAs is an important mechanism to repress the newly invaded TEs.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our results revealed the existence of an evolutionary arms race between the copy numbers of TEs and the abundance of antisense piRNAs at the population level. Although the interactions between TEs and piRNAs are complex and many factors should be considered to impact their interaction dynamics, our results suggest the emergence, repression specificity and strength of piRNAs on TEs should be considered in studying the landscapes of TE insertions in Drosophila. These results deepen our understanding of the interactions between piRNAs and TEs, and also provide novel insights into the nature of genomic conflicts of other forms.",2020,"Shiqi Luo, Hong Zhang, Yuange Duan, Xinmin Yao, Andrew G Clark, Jian Lu"

Localization of sequences coding for histone messenger RNA in the chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster,411642,10.1007/BF00292726,"In situ hybridization of sea urchin (Psammechinus miliaris, Lytechinus pictus and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) histone messenger RNA has been used to map complementary sequences on polytene chromosomes from Drosophila melanogaster. The sea urchin RNA hybridizes to the polytene regions from 39D3 through 39E1-2, including both of these bands (39D2 may also be included). This region is identical to the one which hybridizes most heavily with non-polyadenylated cytoplasmic RNA from D. melanogaster tissues. Sea urchin mRNAs coding for several individual histones each hybridize across the entire region from 39D3 (or D2) through 39E1-2, as would be expected if the individual mRNA sequences are interspersed. In view of the apparently even distribution of sequences complementary to histone mRNA within the 39D3-39E1-2 region, the significance of the several polytene bands in this region remains an open question. Biochemical characterization of the hybrids between sea urchin histone mRNA and D. melanogaster DNA suggest that sea urchin mRNAs for several of the histone classes have some portions which retain enough sequence homology with the D. melanogaster sequences to form hybrids, although the hybrids have base pair mismatches.

We find a relatively low degree of sequence variation in D. melanogaster (theta = 0.0017), which is, however, consistent with its chromosomal location in a region of low recombination. Tests of neutrality do not reject a neutral-evolution model for the whole region. However, pairwise tests with different subregions indicate that there is a relative excess of polymorphic sites in the leader and the intron. Codon usage pattern analysis shows a particularly biased codon usage in the highly conserved regions, which is in line with the hypothesis that selection on translational accuracy is the driving force behind such a bias.

EXPERIMENTAL EVOLUTION OF HSP70 EXPRESSION AND THERMOTOLERANCE IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,28565421,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1999.tb03783.x,"To examine whether recent evolutionary history affects the expression of Hsp70, the major heat-induced-heat shock protein in Drosophila melanogaster, we measured Hsp70 expression, thermotolerance, and hsp70 gene number in replicate populations undergoing laboratory evolution at different temperatures. Despite Hsp70's ancient and highly conserved nature, experimental evolution effectively and replicably modified its expression and phenotype (thermotolerance). Among five D. melanogaster populations founded from a common ancestral population and raised at three different temperatures (one at 18°C, two each at 25°C and 28°C) for twenty years, Hsp70 expression varies in a consistent pattern: the replicate 28°C lines expressed 30-50% less Hsp70 than the other lines at a range of inducing temperatures. This modification was refractory to acclimation, and correlated with thermotolerance: the 28°C lines had significantly lower inducible tolerance of 38.5°C and 39°C. We verified the presence of five hsp70 genes in the genome of each line, excluding copy number variation as a candidate molecular basis of the evolved difference in expression. These findings support the ability of Hsp70 levels in D. melanogaster populations to change over microevolutionary time scales and implicate constancy of environmental temperature as a potentially important selective agent.",1999,"Brian R Bettencourt, Martin E Feder, Sandro Cavicchi"

Strong homologies extend over the entire 6 kb of the ftz upstream region with the best match in the 'upstream element'. We identified several highly conserved boxes embedded in unrelated sequences that correspond extremely well to two germ layer specific enhancers in the upstream element. Transformation experiments revealed that D. hydei ftz gene products can restore D. melanogaster ftz function and, furthermore, that trans-acting factors from D. melanogaster recognize and control D. hydei ftz regulatory elements.

By Northern analysis the cDNAs identify a 1400nt transcript present at every stage of development. By the features described, the clones we have isolated identify the Drosophila rp gene homologous to the L1 rp gene of Xenopus and could code for the L1 ribosomal protein described in D. melanogaster.",1988,"F Rafti, G Gargiulo, A Manzi, C Malva, G Grossi, S Andone, F Graziani"
Inversion polymorphism in Indian natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster,2116984,10.1139/g90-048,"Six natural populations (three urban and three rural) of Drosophila melanogaster from India were analysed for chromosome inversions, revealing the presence of 19 different paracentric autosomal inversions. One new inversion has also been detected in a laboratory stock established from flies collected from Kerala. In total 20 different paracentric inversions in Indian D. melanogaster have been detected during the present study, and of these, 4 are common cosmopolitans; 2 are rare cosmopolitans; 7 are recurrent endemics; and 7 are unique endemics. The quantitative data clearly show that the urban populations are different from the rural ones with respect to inversion polymorphism.",1990,"B N Singh, A Das"
The nature of genetic variation in sex and reproduction-related genes among sibling species of the Drosophila melanogaster complex,15088662,10.1023/b:gene.0000017645.84748.dd,"Much is known about the biology of Drosophila melanogaster. As a model organism, a comprehensive understanding of its development, physiology and reproduction has been acquired. As a result, a broad variety of transferable genetic tools and information has allowed sibling species of the D. melanogaster complex to emerge as an important speciation model system. By comparing D. melanogaster with its close relative, Drosophila simulans, as well as its other sibling species, we are beginning to understand the nature of genetic changes during the early stages of speciation. In general, we find that genes and traits involved in sex and reproduction are more variable. A large assortment of genes and traits that are involved in various aspects of mating and fertility reveal diagnostic differences between these sibling species. Sex and reproduction-related (SRR) genes are, on average, more diverged than genes with no apparent reproductive function. Furthermore, SRR genes appear more permissive at opting in novel function. These results follow a general trend observed in other taxa and demonstrate the preferential involvement of SRR genes in reproductive isolation and species formation.",2004,"Rob J Kulathinal, Rama S Singh"
Regulation of amylase activity in Drosophila melanogaster: variation in the number of enzyme molecules produced by different amylase genotypes,6170292,10.1007/BF00484009,"Purified amylases from high- and low-activity variants of Drosophila melanogaster showed identical specific activities. Immunoelectrophoresis of crude larval homogenates showed severalfold differences between strains in the amounts of cross-reacting material. Control of amylase activity is ""trans""-acting in heterozygotes between high- and low-activity variants. These results suggest the existence of polymorphic regulatory genes affecting the production levels of amylase protein in D. melanogaster.",1981,D A Hickey

[Temporal dynamics and variation of multilocus ISSR-PCR DNA markers in the Uman' population of Drosophila melanogaster over two decades (1984-2004)],18664140,,The temporal dynamics of genomic variation in the Uman' (Ukraine) population of Drosophila melanogaster over the period 1984-2004 was studied using multilocus ISSR markers. Considerable polymorphism of the genomic DNA fragments corresponding to ISSR markers was found in the D. melanogaster population studied: the values of average heterozygosity varied from 0.085 to 0.127 depending on the year. Significant differences in the frequencies of dominant alleles between the samples of different years were recorded for 12 of the 30 DNA fractions detected. These changes are nondirectional and random. The pattern of detected variation suggests the determining influence of gene drift and migration process on the variation of noncoding DNA sequences in the Uman' population of D. melanogaster.,2008,"O V Vaulin, I K Zakharov"
Closely related species of Drosophila can contain different libraries of middle repetitive DNA sequences,6413170,10.1007/BF00327329,"Very few of the middle repetitive DNA sequences found in Drosophila melanogaster are present in all of the species of the D. melanogaster subgroup. One member of the subgroup, D. erecta, lacks most of the families of repetitive elements from D. melanogaster (including copia and 412) but possesses many other families not present in the D. melanogaster genome. Other species in the subgroup possess some families in these two species and lack others. From this we conclude that most individual middle repetitive families are highly unstable components of the Drosophila genome over short periods of evolutionary time.",1983,A P Dowsett
Sequences homologous to P elements occur in Drosophila paulistorum,6093120,10.1073/pnas.81.21.6794,"P elements, a class of mobile genetic elements that cause hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, have thus far been shown to occur only in this species. Using whole genome blot analysis, we present evidence which indicates that sequences homologous to D. melanogaster P elements also occur in Drosophila paulistorum, a distant relative. D. paulistorum is considered a species complex, consisting of six known incipient species or semispecies. All six semispecies possess P element homologous sequences. We further show that there is conservation of restriction enzyme recognition sites between the D. melanogaster and D. paulistorum P element sequences. The presence of P elements in these two species may clarify the roles of recent invasion and rapid loss in the temporal distribution of P elements in Drosophila.",1984,"S B Daniels, L D Strausbaugh, L Ehrman, R Armstrong"

This polypeptide shows extensive similarities to the known eukaryotic translocase polypeptides, the similarity being greatest (up to 80% identity) to the mammalian ADP/ATP translocases. In situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes of D. melanogaster with the sequence characterized in this study showed localization at a single site on the X chromosome at 9E.

Pattern of chromosomal localization of the Hoppel transposable element family in the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup,9872668,10.1023/a:1009277322626,"We have isolated a Hoppel-like transposon from heterochromatin of the second chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster and used a conserved DNA sequence between the different elements of this family to determine their distribution in both mitotic and polytene chromosomes. The hybridization pattern of polytene chromosomes extends throughout the entire chromocentre, as well as a substantial portion of the fourth chromosome. Analysis of different wild-type strains of D. melanogaster shows variation in euchromatic insertion sites, although most insertions are found near the chromocentre. The positions and the number of heterochromatic clusters of Hoppel on mitotic chromosomes are conserved among the several strains analysed. Accurate mapping of this element was achieved by in situ hybridization on D. melanogaster mitotic chromosomes that had previously been banded with Hoechst 33258. To evaluate the evolutionary stability of this pattern, different species were analysed by in situ hybridization and Southern blotting. We conclude that Hoppel has a conserved distribution in mitotic heterochromatin within the D. melanogaster subgroup, established around 5 million years ago. The overall conservation of heterochormatic organization supports the notion that heterochormatin does perform important structural and functional roles.",1998,"P A Coelho, J Queiroz-Machado, D Hartl, C E Sunkel"

In this work, we report a phylogenetic study based mainly on the analysis of the 5' region of the env gene from several species of the obscura group, and also from sequences already reported of D. melanogaster, Drosophila virilis, and Drosophila hydei. Our results indicate that the gypsy elements from species of the obscura group constitute a monophyletic group which has strongly diverged from the prototypic D. melanogaster gypsy element. Phylogenetic relationships between gypsy sequences from the obscura group are consistent with those of their hosts, indicating vertical transmission. However, D. hydei and D. virilis gypsy sequences are closely related to those of the affinis subgroup, which could be indicative of horizontal transmission.",2000,"R P Vázquez-Manrique, M Hernández, M J Martínez-Sebastián, R de Frutos"

Evolutionary conservation of the chromosomal configuration and regulation of amylase genes among eight species of the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup,2461506,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040509,"Nuclear DNA was extracted from each of the eight species comprising the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup. Southern hybridization of this DNA by using a molecular probe specific for the alpha-amylase coding region showed that the duplicated structure of the amylase locus, first found in D. melanogaster, is conserved among all species of the melanogaster subgroup. Evidence is also presented for the concerted evolution of the duplicated genes within each species. In addition, it is shown that the glucose repression of amylase gene expression, which has been extensively studied in D. melanogaster, is not confined to this species but occurs in all eight members of the species subgroup. Thus, both the duplicated gene structure and the glucose repression of Drosophila amylase gene activity are stable over extended periods of evolutionary time.",1988,"V Payant, S Abukashawa, M Sasseville, B F Benkel, D A Hickey, J David"

Heterogeneity of copia sites of location was found in no other substocks analyzed. The heterogeneity was shown to be caused by copia insertions in new sites. The frequency of insertions is about 12% per haploid genome per generation. The retrotransposon excisions and somatic transpositions were not observed. The location of retrotransposons mdg1, mdg2, mdg3, mdg4, 297 and H.M.S. Beagle appeared to be stable in all the stocks analyzed.

We have shown that this venom causes immune suppression in Drosophila melanogaster pupa but the mechanism involved remained unclear. Here, we show using transgenic D. melanogaster with fluorescent hemocytes that the in vivo number of plasmatocytes and lamellocytes decreases after envenomation while it has a limited effect on crystal cells. After in vitro incubation with venom, the cytoskeleton of plasmatocytes underwent rearrangement with actin aggregation around the internal vacuoles, which increased with incubation time and venom concentration. The venom also decreased the lamellocytes adhesion capacity and induced nucleus fragmentation. Electron microscopy observation revealed that the shape of the nucleus and mitochondria became irregular after in vivo incubation with venom and confirmed the increased vacuolization with the formation of autophagosomes-like structures. Almost all venom-treated hemocytes became positive for TUNEL assays, indicating massive induced apoptosis. In support, the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK attenuated the venom-induced morphological changes suggesting an involvement of caspases. Our data indicate that P. vindemiae venom inhibits D. melanogaster host immunity by inducing strong apoptosis in hemocytes.

Background selection and patterns of genetic diversity in Drosophila melanogaster,8940902,10.1017/s0016672300034029,"Theoretical models of the effects of selection against deleterious mutations on variation at linked neutral sites (background selection) are used to predict the relations between chromosomal location and genetic variability at the DNA level, in Drosophila melanogaster. The sensitivity of the predictions to variation in the mutation, selection and recombination parameters on which they are based is examined. It is shown that many features of the observed relations between chromosomal location and level of genetic diversity in D. melanogaster can be explained by background selection, especially if the weak selective forces acting on transposable elements are taken into account. In particular, the gradient in diversity in the distal portion of the X chromosome, and the lack of diversity on chromosome 4 and at the bases of the major chromosomes, can be fully accounted for. There are, however, discrepancies between predicted and observed values for some loci in D. melanogaster, which may reflect the effects of forces other than background selection.",1996,B Charlesworth
copia expression is variable among natural populations of Drosophila,1700962,,"A survey of copia (retroviral-like element) expression in flies representing 37 populations worldwide of Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila simulans and Drosophila mauritiana demonstrates that, although copia elements are present in all three species, copia-encoded transcripts are detectable only in D. melanogaster. Levels of copia transcripts vary nearly 100-fold among flies representing geographically diverse populations of D. melanogaster and this variation is not correlated with variability in copia copy number. Analysis of transcript levels in interpopulation hybrids demonstrates that much of this variability may be attributable to the action of trans-acting controls. The geographic and phylogenetic pattern of copia expression suggests that moderate to high levels of copia expression may be a relatively recent evolutionary acquisition. The potential evolutionary significance of these findings is discussed.",1990,"A K Csink, J F McDonald"
Restriction-map variation in the Notch region of Drosophila melanogaster,2833676,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040475,"A worldwide sample of 37 X chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster was analyzed with four restriction endonucleases for a 60-kb region of the Notch locus.

The four insertions and one deletion observed in the 37 chromosomes sampled were located 3' to the Notch transcript; one insertion was represented twice in the sample. The amount of linkage disequilibrium in the Notch region appears to be lower than that of the alcohol dehydrogenase locus in D. melanogaster. The few instances of linkage disequilibrium observed could be due to geographic differentiation of African populations. The genetic variation estimates in the Notch region were comparable with those of the alcohol dehydrogenase region in D. melanogaster, suggesting that molecular genetic variation on the X chromosome is not dramatically reduced by selection against slightly deleterious alleles.",1988,"S W Schaeffer, C F Aquadro, C H Langley"

Instead, resistance gene(s) are restricted to chromosome two, and may be further restricted to the centromeric region of this chromosome. This finding suggests that natural adaptations-like many responses to artificial selection and human disturbance-sometimes have a simple genetic basis.",1997,"H Allen Orr, Shannon Irving"
[The frequency distribution and establishment of fruit fly strain of segregation distorter in Drosophila melanogaster in China],11147347,,"Segregation Distorter (SD) is a meiotic drive system of natural occurrence. Heterozygous SD/SD+ males transmit the SD chromosome in vast excess over the normal homolog. SD chromosomes have been recovered at low frequency (1%-5%) from almost every population that has been screened for them in many places of the world. To examine whether there is SD system in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster in China, we surveyed a few populations of D. melanogaster in Beijing and Qingdao respectively. The results suggested that SD is also found in every population examined at frequency of 1%-5%. On the basis of learning distribution of SD in China, we established a fruit fly stoch of SD from wild population of D. melanogaster in Beianhe district of Beijing. Furthermore, instead of using traditional genetic hybridization, we used molecular approach, PCR, to examine the distribution of SD chromosomes, which has been proved a very effective, quick and convenient method.",2000,"L Hao, Z L Gu, Z H Dai"
Aberrant pre-mRNA maturation is caused by LINE insertions into introns of the white gene of Drosophila melanogaster,7479058,10.1093/nar/23.20.4015,"Insertional mutagenesis screens have provided thousands of mutant alleles for analysing genes of varied functions in Drosophila melanogaster. We here document mechanisms of insertional mutagenesis by a LINE element, the I factor, by determining the molecular structure of RNAs produced from two alleles of the white gene of D.melanogaster, wIR1 and wIR6. These alleles result from insertion of the I factor into introns of the gene. We show that sequences present within the element direct aberrant splicing and termination events. When the I factor is inserted within the white first intron it may lead to the use of a cryptic 3' splice site which does not contain the dinucleotide AG. This splicing gives rise to a chimeric messenger RNA whose synthesis is controlled differently in tissues where the mutated gene is expressed. When the I factor is inserted within the white last intron it induces synthesis of truncated mRNAs. These results provide, for the first time, mechanisms for I factor insertional mutagenesis. They are discussed in the more general context of RNA processing in Drosophila and the evolution of eukaryotic gene introns.",1995,"O Lajoinie, M E Drake, B Dastugue, C Vaury"

Genetic variation at the alcohol dehydrogenase locus in Drosophila melanogaster in relation to environmental variation: Ethanol levels in breeding sites and allozyme frequencies,28310081,10.1007/BF00540600,Ethanol levels in Drosophila breeding sites in seepages of unfortified wine inside wineries have been found to be similar to those in many decaying fruits and vegetables. Fortified wine seepages inside wineries have ethanol levels on average three times as high as other breeding sites. However there was no evidence that this variation in ethanol levels was associated with differences in Adh F frequencies in D. melanogaster at sites either within wineries or outside wineries. D. simulans was at lower frequencies at sites inside wineries compared to sites outside although this difference may not be related to ethanol levels. It is concluded that adaptation to natural levels of environmental ethanol by D. melanogaster does not necessarily modify Adh frequencies.,1981,"J B Gibson, T W May, A V Wilks"

We found that the susceptibility to oxidative stressors was significantly increased in spotted wing drosophila compared with those of D. melanogaster. In addition, we found that spotted wing drosophila had significantly reduced glutathione-S transferase (GST) activity and gene numbers. Furthermore, fructose concentrations found in spotted wing drosophila were significantly lower than those of D. melanogaster.

Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for bluetongue virus replication and tropism,22674991,10.1128/JVI.00131-12,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) is the etiological agent of bluetongue (BT), a hemorrhagic disease of ruminants that can cause high levels of morbidity and mortality. BTV is an arbovirus transmitted between its ruminant hosts by Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). Recently, Europe has experienced some of the largest BT outbreaks ever recorded, including areas with no known history of the disease, leading to unprecedented economic and animal welfare issues. The current lack of genomic resources and genetic tools for Culicoides restricts any detailed study of the mechanisms involved in the virus-insect interactions. In contrast, the genome of the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) has been successfully sequenced, and it is used extensively as a model of molecular pathways due to the existence of powerful genetic technology. In this study, D. melanogaster is investigated as a model for the replication and tropism of BTV. Using reverse genetics, a modified BTV-1 that expresses the fluorescent mCherry protein fused to the viral nonstructural protein NS3 (BTV-1/NS3mCherry) was generated. We demonstrate that BTV-1/NS3mCherry is not only replication competent as it retains many characteristics of the wild-type virus but also replicates efficiently in D. melanogaster after removal of the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis by antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, confocal microscopy shows that the tissue tropism of BTV-1/NS3mCherry in D. melanogaster resembles that described previously for BTV in Culicoides. Overall, the data presented in this study demonstrate the feasibility of using D. melanogaster as a genetic model to investigate BTV-insect interactions that cannot be otherwise addressed in vector species.",2012,"Andrew E Shaw, Eva Veronesi, Guillemette Maurin, Najate Ftaich, Francois Guiguen, Frazer Rixon, Maxime Ratinier, Peter Mertens, Simon Carpenter, Massimo Palmarini, Christophe Terzian, Frederick Arnaud"

Drosophila melanogaster males carry a pair of MOLs in the 5th abdominal segment, whereas D. subobscura males carry a pair in both the 5th and 4th segments. We hypothesized that the fru gene of D. subobscura but not that of D. melanogaster contains a cis element that directs the formation of the additional pair of MOLs. Successively extended 5' DNA fragments to the P1 promoter of D. subobscura or the corresponding fragments that are chimeric (i.e., containing both melanogaster and subobscura elements) were introduced into D. melanogaster and tested for their ability to induce the MOL to locate the hypothetical cis element. We found that a 1.5-2-kb genomic fragment located 4-6-kb upstream of the P1 promoter in D. subobscura but not that of D. melanogaster permits MOL formation in females, provided this fragment is grafted to the distal ∼4-kb segment from D. melanogaster, demonstrating that this genomic fragment of D. subobscura contains a cis element for the MOL induction.",2015,"Sakino Takayanagi, Gakuta Toba, Tamas Lukacsovich, Manabu Ote, Kosei Sato, Daisuke Yamamoto"
Functional conservation of the Drosophila hybrid incompatibility gene Lhr,21366928,10.1186/1471-2148-11-57,"Background:
      
    

    
      Hybrid incompatibilities such as sterility and lethality are commonly modeled as being caused by interactions between two genes, each of which has diverged separately in one of the hybridizing lineages. The gene Lethal hybrid rescue (Lhr) encodes a rapidly evolving heterochromatin protein that causes lethality of hybrid males in crosses between Drosophila melanogaster females and D. simulans males. Previous genetic analyses showed that hybrid lethality is caused by D. simulans Lhr but not by D. melanogaster Lhr, confirming a critical prediction of asymmetry in the evolution of a hybrid incompatibility gene.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here we have examined the functional properties of Lhr orthologs from multiple Drosophila species, including interactions with other heterochromatin proteins, localization to heterochromatin, and ability to complement hybrid rescue in D. melanogaster/D. simulans hybrids. We find that these properties are conserved among most Lhr orthologs, including Lhr from D. melanogaster, D. simulans and the outgroup species D. yakuba.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We conclude that evolution of the hybrid lethality properties of Lhr between D. melanogaster and D. simulans did not involve extensive loss or gain of functions associated with protein interactions or localization to heterochromatin.",2011,"Nicholas J Brideau, Daniel A Barbash"
A test of double interspecific introgression of nucleoporin genes in Drosophila,25172915,10.1534/g3.114.014027,"In interspecific hybrids between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, the D. simulans nucleoporin-encoding Nup96(sim) and Nup160(sim) can cause recessive lethality if the hybrid does not also inherit the D. simulans X chromosome. In addition, Nup160(sim) leads to recessive female sterility in the D. melanogaster genetic background. Here, we conducted carefully controlled crosses to better understandthe relationship between Nup96(sim) and Nup160(sim). Nup96(sim) did not lead to female sterility in the D. melanogaster genetic background, and double introgression of Nup96(sim) and Nup160(sim) did not generally lead to lethality when one was heterozygous and the other homozygous (hemizygous). It appears that introgression of additional autosomal D. simulans genes is necessary to cause lethality and that the effect of the introgression is dominant to D. melanogaster alleles. Interestingly, the genetic background affected dominance of Nup96(sim), and double introgression carrying homozygous Nup96(sim) and hemizygous Nup160(sim) resulted in lethality. Thus, Nup96(sim) and Nup160(sim) seem to be two components of the same incompatibility.",2014,"Kyoichi Sawamura, Kazunori Maehara, Yoko Keira, Hiroyuki O Ishikawa, Takeshi Sasamura, Tomoko Yamakawa, Kenji Matsuno"

The present study was undertaken to validate our previously modified version of the Comet assay for genotoxicity assessment in Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon R(+)) with four well-known mutagenic and carcinogenic alkylating agents, i.e. ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and cyclophosphamide (CP). Third instar larvae (74 +/- 2 h) of D.melanogaster were fed different concentrations of EMS, MMS, ENU and CP (0.05, 0.5 and 1.0 mM) mixed standard Drosophila food for 24 h. At 98 +/- 2 h, the anterior midgut from control and treated larvae were dissected out, single-cell suspensions were prepared and Comet assay was performed. Our results show a dose-dependent increase in DNA damage with all the four alkylating agents, in comparison to control. The lower concentration (0.05 mM) of the test chemicals, except MMS, did not induce any DNA damage in the gut cells of the exposed larvae. When comparison of Comet parameters was made among the chemicals, MMS was found to be the most potent genotoxicant and ENU the least. The present study validated our previous observation and shows that D.melanogaster is a sensitive and suitable model for the in vivo assessment of genotoxicity using our modified alkaline Comet assay.",2005,"Hifzur R Siddique, D Kar Chowdhuri, D K Saxena, Alok Dhawan"

Evolution of a desaturase involved in female pheromonal cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis and courtship behavior in Drosophila,18207084,10.1016/j.ibmb.2007.11.005,"Drosophila species exhibit polymorphism in female pheromonal cuticular hydrocarbons, with 7-monoenes produced in Drosophila simulans and 7,11-dienes in most populations of Drosophila melanogaster (5,9-dienes in several African populations). A female-biased desaturase, desatF, expressed only in D. melanogaster is involved in the synthesis of 7,11-dienes. We investigated the role of desatF in 5,9-diene flies. We constructed a 5,9-diene strain knock-down for desatF and showed that desatF is involved in 5,9-diene formation. We also studied D. melanogaster/D. simulans hybrids. These hybrid females produced dienes and received normal courtship from D. melanogaster males, but copulation success was reduced. With D. simulans males, courtship was decreased and no copulation occurred. Hybrids with a chromosomal deletion of the D. melanogaster desatF gene had no dienes and received normal courtship from D. simulans males; depending on the D. simulans parental strain, 7-19% of them succeeded in mating. D. simulans desatF promoter region shows 21-23% gaps and 86-89% identity with D. melanogaster promoter region, the coding region 93-94% identity, depending on the strain.

Expression of thermal tolerance genes in two Drosophila species with different acclimation capacities,31466754,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.005,"Heat tolerance increases at higher acclimation temperatures in D. melanogaster, but not in D. subobscura. The two species represent separate lineages of the subgenus Sophophora of Drosophila with contrasting tropical African and temperate Palearctic evolutionary histories. D. melanogaster has five copies of the inducible hsp70 gene distributed in two clusters, named A (with two copies) and B (three copies), while D. subobscura has only two copies arranged similarly to cluster A of D. melanogaster. The hsp70s of the two species also differ in their cis-regulatory regions, with D. melanogaster exhibiting features of a faster and more productive promoter. We predicted that the interspecific variation in acclimation capacity of heat tolerance is explained by evolved variation in expression of the major group of heat shock proteins. To test this prediction, we compared basal levels of gene expression at different developmental temperatures within each of the two species. Furthermore, we explored the heat hardening dynamics by measuring the induction of gene expression during a ramping assay. The prediction of a stronger heat shock protein response in D. melanogaster as compared to D. subobscura was confirmed for both long-term acclimation and short-term hardening. For D. melanogaster the upregulation with temperature ramping ranged from less than two fold (hsp26) to 2500 fold (hsp70A) increase. In all cases induction in D. melanogaster exceeded that of D. subobscura homologs. These differences correlate with structural differences in the regulatory regions of hsp70, and might explain differences in acclimation capacity among species. Finally, in D. melanogaster we found an indication of an inverse relationship between basal and induced levels of hsp70A and hsp83 expression, suggesting a divergent role for thermal adaptation of these genes at benign and stressful temperatures, respectively.",2019,"Jesper Givskov Sørensen, Marta Puig Giribets, Rosa Tarrío, Francisco Rodríguez-Trelles, Mads Fristrup Schou, Volker Loeschcke"

Comparative genomics of accessory gland protein genes in Drosophila melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura,15601888,10.1093/molbev/msi067,"Male accessory gland protein genes (Acps) evolve rapidly in the melanogaster species subgroup of Drosophila. However, conservation of Acps in more diverged lineages is poorly understood. We used comparisons of the D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura genome sequences, along with empirical investigation of D. pseudoobscura transcription, to assay the D. pseudoobscura genome for orthologs of 13 D. melanogaster Acps (Acp26Aa, Acp26Ab, Acp29AB, Acp32CD, Acp33A, Acp36DE, Acp53Ea, Acp62F, Acp63F, Acp70A, Acp76A, Acp95EF, and Acp98AB).

Acp62F and Acp70A are also present, although they are located in nonsyntenic regions. For six of the remaining seven Acps, computational and molecular biological evidence suggests they are D. melanogaster orphans. The weighted average of interspecific amino acid identity for alignable residues across the six orthologous Acps is 35.6%. Population genetic data for D. pseudoobscura Acp26Aa show that this gene has been evolving under directional selection, as it has been in D. melanogaster/D. simulans. All four D. melanogaster Acps we analyze from chromosome arm 3L are absent from the homologous D. pseudoobscura XR chromosome arm, which was autosomal before an X chromosome-autosome fusion event in the D. pseudoobscura lineage.

piRNA and Transposon Dynamics in Drosophila: A Female Story,32396626,10.1093/gbe/evaa094,"The germlines of metazoans contain transposable elements (TEs) causing genetic instability and affecting fitness. To protect the germline from TE activity, gonads of metazoans produce TE-derived PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that silence TE expression. In Drosophila, our understanding of piRNA biogenesis is mainly based on studies of the Drosophila melanogaster female germline. However, it is not known whether piRNA functions are also important in the male germline or whether and how piRNAs are affected by the global genomic context. To address these questions, we compared genome sequences, transcriptomes, and small RNA libraries extracted from entire testes and ovaries of two sister species: D. melanogaster and Drosophila simulans. We found that most TE-derived piRNAs were produced in ovaries and that piRNA pathway genes were strongly overexpressed in ovaries compared with testes, indicating that the silencing of TEs by the piRNA pathway mainly took place in the female germline. To study the relationship between host piRNAs and TE landscape, we analyzed TE genomic features and how they correlate with piRNA production in the two species. In D. melanogaster, we found that TE-derived piRNAs target recently active TEs. In contrast, although Drosophila simulans TEs do not display any features of recent activity, the host still intensively produced silencing piRNAs targeting old TE relics. Together, our results show that the piRNA silencing response mainly takes place in Drosophila ovaries and indicate that the host piRNA response is implemented following a burst of TE activity and could persist long after the extinction of active TE families.",2020,"Bastien Saint-Leandre, Pierre Capy, Aurelie Hua-Van, Jonathan Filée"
The Doc transposable element in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans: genomic distribution and transcription,7813908,10.1007/BF01435244,"The mobile element Doc is similar in structure and coding potential to the LINE families found in various organisms. In this paper, we analyze the insertional and structural polymorphism of this element and show that it appears to have a long evolutionary history in the genome of D. melanogaster. Like the family of I elements, the Doc family seems to display three types of elements: full length elements, defective members that have recently transposed and long since immobilized members common to each D. melanogaster strain. These three classes of Doc elements seem to be present in D. simulans, a closely related species to D. melanogaster. Furthermore, we show that Doc is transcribed as a polyadenylated RNA of about 5 kb in length, presumed to be a full length RNA. This transcript is present in different tissues and at different stages of Drosophila development. These results are compared with previous records on the chromosomal distribution of LINEs or other transposable element families. Doc transcription is analyzed in an attempt to understand the link between Doc transcription and transposition.",1994,"C Vaury, M C Chaboissier, M E Drake, O Lajoinie, B Dastugue, A Pélisson"
Gypsy homologous sequences in Drosophila subobscura (gypsyDS),8381880,10.1007/BF00166248,"Characterization of sequences homologous to the Drosophila melanogaster gypsy transposable element was carried out in Drosophila subobscura (gypsyDS). They were found to be widely distributed among natural populations of this species. From Southern blot and in situ analyses, these sequences appear to be mobile in this species. GypsyDS sequences are located in both euchromatic and heterochromatic regions. A complete gypsyDS sequence was isolated from a D. subobscura genomic library, and a 1.3-kb fragment which aligns with the ORF2 of the D. melanogaster gypsy element was sequenced. Comparisons of this sequence in three species (D. subobscura, D. melanogaster, and D. virilis) indicate that there is greater similarity between the D. subobscura-D. virilis sequences than between D. subobscura and D. melanogaster. Molecular divergence of gypsy sequences between D. virilis and D. subobscura is estimated at 16 MY, whereas the most likely divergence time of these two species is more than 60 MY. These data strongly suggest that gypsy sequences have been horizontally transferred between these species.",1993,"T M Alberola, R de Frutos"
Species-specific activation of EGF receptor signaling underlies evolutionary diversity in the dorsal appendage number of the genus Drosophila eggshells,12963110,10.1016/s0925-4773(03)00164-3,"In Drosophila melanogaster, the patterning of dorsal appendages on the eggshell is strictly controlled by EGFR signaling. However, the number of dorsal appendages is remarkably diverse among Drosophila species. For example, D. melanogaster and D. virilis have two and four dorsal appendages, respectively. Here we show that during oogenesis the expression patterns of rhomboid (rho) and argos (aos), positive and negative regulators of EGFR signaling, respectively, were substantially different between D. melanogaster and D. virilis. Importantly, the number and position of both the rho expression and MAPK activation were consistent with those of the dorsal appendages in each species. Despite the differences in the spatial expression, these results suggest that the function of EGFR signaling in dorsal appendage formation is largely conserved between these two species. Thus, our results link the species-specific activation of EGFR signaling and the evolution of eggshell morphology in Drosophila.",2003,"Yukio Nakamura, Kenji Matsuno"
Effect of thermal environment on life histories of free living Drosophila melanogaster and D. subobscura,28307838,10.1007/BF00334650,"The variability of morphological and lifehistory traits in Drosophila melanogaster and D. subobscura, two sympatric Drosophila species of different climatic origin, were investigated with regard to seasonal and daily temperature and humidity fluctuations to assess thermal sensitivity and the responses of freeliving organisms to oscillating temperatures. Temperature and humidity were measured continuously at the site where Drosophila were observed throughout the day, and thus represent a realistic picture of the temperature environment of these animals. A phenotypic model (gaussian curve) of temperature performance was fitted to daily fecundities and provided estimates of the position of temperature optimum and of the maximum and the breadth of performance for both species. D. melanogaster had a higher optimum temperature than D. subobscura. A trade-off between the maximum and the breadth of performance was detected both within and between the species.",1996,Ranka Junge-Berberović
Behavior genetics of olfactory responses in Drosophila. I. Olfactometry and strain differences in Drosophila melanogaster,825093,10.1007/BF01065698,"A simple olfactometer was constructed for measuring the responses of adult Drosophila to odoriferous substances, and an index (attractability index, AI) is proposed to evaluate the response. Five strains of Drosophila melanogaster of different geographic origins were tested for their responses to five chemical attractants: ethyl alcohol, acetic acid, lactic acid, ethyl acetate, and n-butyraldehyde. Statistical analysis has shown that the differences of AI among strains are highly significant for all the odorants except acetic acid and that male flies are, in general, less sensitive than females. The number of flies which were inactive in the olfactometer also varied with strain, sex, and odorant, suggesting the involvement of some other behaviors, and this raises some difficulties in interpreting the heterogeneities of AI. Nevertheless, these results suggest that a considerable amount of genetic variation for olfactory response exists in natural population of D. melanogaster.",1976,Y Fuyama
Evidence for a functional interaction between the Bari1 transposable element and the cytochrome P450 cyp12a4 gene in Drosophila melanogaster,16076534,10.1016/j.gene.2005.06.005,"Previous studies of the genomic distribution of the transposon Bari1 in Drosophila melanogaster have revealed an element which is fixed at division 91F in over 90 lab and natural populations. Here we report about the structural and transcriptional features of the insertion site which was studied in sublines isolated from an exceptional Drosophila line polymorphic for the presence/absence of Bari1 at 91F. The insert is located at the 3' end of the cyp12a4 gene that belongs to the cytochrome P450 family. In flies with the insert the transcript of this gene encompasses 18 nucleotides of the transposon, it is shorter and is about tenfold more abundant compared to flies devoid of it. Although the hypothetical selective agent remains unknown, these data are suggestive of a selective advantage brought about by the Bari1 insert and are reminiscent of recent evidence for functional mutagenesis of cyp6g1, another P450 gene, brought about by Accord and Doc transposable elements in D. melanogaster and Drosophila simulans.",2005,"Renè Massimiliano Marsano, Ruggiero Caizzi, Roberta Moschetti, Nikolaj Junakovic"
"Evolution of hydra, a recently evolved testis-expressed gene with nine alternative first exons in Drosophila melanogaster",17616977,10.1371/journal.pgen.0030107,"We describe here the Drosophila gene hydra that appears to have originated de novo in the melanogaster subgroup and subsequently evolved in both structure and expression level in Drosophila melanogaster and its sibling species. D. melanogaster hydra encodes a predicted protein of approximately 300 amino acids with no apparent similarity to any previously known proteins. The syntenic region flanking hydra on both sides is found in both D. ananassae and D. pseudoobscura, but hydra is found only in melanogaster subgroup species, suggesting that it originated less than approximately 13 million y ago. Exon 1 of hydra has undergone recurrent duplications, leading to the formation of nine tandem alternative exon 1s in D. melanogaster. Seven of these alternative exons are flanked on their 3' side by the transposon DINE-1 (Drosophila interspersed element-1). We demonstrate that at least four of the nine duplicated exon 1s can function as alternative transcription start sites. The entire hydra locus has also duplicated in D. simulans and D. sechellia. D. melanogaster hydra is expressed most intensely in the proximal testis, suggesting a role in late-stage spermatogenesis. The coding region of hydra has a relatively high Ka/Ks ratio between species, but the ratio is less than 1 in all comparisons, suggesting that hydra is subject to functional constraint. Analysis of sequence polymorphism and divergence of hydra shows that it has evolved under positive selection in the lineage leading to D. melanogaster. The dramatic structural changes surrounding the first exons do not affect the tissue specificity of gene expression: hydra is expressed predominantly in the testes in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. yakuba. However, we have found that expression level changed dramatically (approximately >20-fold) between D. melanogaster and D. simulans. While hydra initially evolved in the absence of nearby transposable element insertions, we suggest that the subsequent accumulation of repetitive sequences in the hydra region may have contributed to structural and expression-level evolution by inducing rearrangements and causing local heterochromatinization. Our analysis further shows that recurrent evolution of both gene structure and expression level may be characteristics of newly evolved genes. We also suggest that late-stage spermatogenesis is the functional target for newly evolved and rapidly evolving male-specific genes.",2007,"Shou-Tao Chen, Hsin-Chien Cheng, Daniel A Barbash, Hsiao-Pei Yang"

Divergence of water balance mechanisms in two melanic Drosophila species from the western Himalayas,21220040,10.1016/j.cbpa.2010.12.018,"Drosophila busckii is more abundant under colder and drier montane habitats in the western Himalayas as compared to Drosophila melanogaster but the mechanistic basis of such climatic adaptations is largely unknown. We tested the hypothesis whether genetic variation or phenotypic plasticity of cuticular traits confer adaptive protection against desiccation stress in two melanic Drosophila species living under drier montane localities. For D. melanogaster, changes in melanisation are known to be associated with reduced water loss but there are no data on D. busckii. We investigated changes in body melanisation, cuticular lipids, desiccation resistance, water loss, extractable hemolymph volume (%), and dehydration tolerance in six sympatric populations of D. busckii and D. melanogaster over an altitudinal range of 640-2236 m. D. busckii is a melanic species but changes in cuticular water loss are negatively correlated with cuticular lipid mass and not with body melanisation. In D. melanogaster, there are no plastic effects (14-28 °C) for cuticular lipid mass but variation in body melanisation is associated with desiccation-related traits. Effects of organic solvents (hexane or chloroform: methanol), developmental plasticity and seasonal variation in cuticular lipids affect body water loss in D. busckii but no such changes occur in D. melanogaster. Thus, sympatric populations of D. busckii and D. melanogaster have evolved different water balance mechanisms under shared environmental conditions in the western Himalayas. Multiple measures of desiccation resistance in these species show clinal variation with altitude, consistent with adaptation to increased desiccation stress.",2011,"Ravi Parkash, Dau Dayal Aggarwal, Bhawna Kalra, Poonam Ranga"

Contrasting patterns of transposable element insertions in Drosophila heat-shock promoters,20041194,10.1371/journal.pone.0008486,"The proximal promoter regions of heat-shock genes harbor a remarkable number of P transposable element (TE) insertions relative to both positive and negative control proximal promoter regions in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. We have screened the sequenced genomes of 12 species of Drosophila to test whether this pattern is unique to these populations. In the 12 species' genomes, transposable element insertions are no more abundant in promoter regions of single-copy heat-shock genes than in promoters with similar or dissimilar architecture. Also, insertions appear randomly distributed across the promoter region, whereas insertions clustered near the transcription start site in promoters of single-copy heat-shock genes in D. melanogaster natural populations. Hsp70 promoters exhibit more TE insertions per promoter than all other genesets in the 12 species, similarly to in natural populations of D. melanogaster. Insertions in the Hsp70 promoter region, however, cluster away from the transcription start site in the 12 species, but near it in natural populations of D. melanogaster. These results suggest that D. melanogaster heat-shock promoters are unique in terms of their interaction with transposable elements, and confirm that Hsp70 promoters are distinctive in TE insertions across Drosophila.",2009,"Robert A Haney, Martin E Feder"

Both species are native to tropical Africa and have colonised the rest of the world.

RpL10A regulates oogenesis progression in the banana prawn Fenneropenaeus merguiensis and Drosophila melanogaster,21726559,10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.06.012,"To develop banana prawn (Fenneropenaeus merguiensis) aquaculture, the mechanism of ovarian maturation is under investigation. In a previous study, we reported the RpL10A protein as an ovarian maturation stimulator. To further investigate the function of RpL10A, we turned to the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) to take advantage of the genetic tools available. Here, we elucidate the expression and function of RpL10A in the D. melanogaster ovary. RpL10A is expressed in the cytoplasm of both nurse and follicle cells throughout oogenesis. While shrimp have one RpL10A gene, D. melanogaster has two genes, RpL10Aa and RpL10Ab. RpL10Ab displays more similarity with shrimp RpL10A and was further investigated. RpL10Ab homozygous mutants are lethal and germline clone analysis showed that RpL10Ab is an essential gene in oogenesis. Moreover, RpL10Ab(-) germline clones resulted in premature death of the follicle cells. This phenotype is reminiscent of some insulin pathway mutants, suggesting that RpL10Ab may be involved in the insulin signaling pathway. In addition, RpL10Ab(-) follicle cells showed abnormal nuclei and membranes. Shrimp RpL10A rescued RpL10Ab homozygous mutants, revealing their functional conservation. Surprisingly, we found cell death in multiple tissues when RpL10A was over-expressed, suggesting that proper RpL10A levels are important. This research reveals novel findings about the role of RpL10A during oogenesis and may, in the future, lead to new approaches to stimulate ovarian development in shrimp.",2011,"Monwadee Wonglapsuwan, Wilaiwan Chotigeat, Allison Timmons, Kimberly McCall"

The comparison of agporin with its putative Drosophila counterpart revealed that both the nucleotide sequence and the structural organization of the two genes are strikingly conserved even though the ancestral lines of A. gambiae and D. melanogaster are thought to have diverged about 250 million years ago.

R1 and R2 retrotransposition and deletion in the rDNA loci on the X and Y chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster,14573479,,"The non-LTR retrotransposons R1 and R2 insert into the 28S rRNA genes of arthropods. Comparisons among Drosophila lineages have shown that these elements are vertically inherited, while studies within species have indicated a rapid turnover of individual copies (elimination of old copies and the insertion of new copies). To better understand the turnover of R1 and R2, 200 retrotranspositions and nearly 100 eliminations have been scored in the Harwich mutation-accumulation lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Because the rDNA arrays in D. melanogaster are present on the X and Y chromosomes and no exchanges were detected in these lines, it was possible to show that R1 retrotranspositions occur predominantly in the male germ line, while R2 retrotranspositions were more evenly divided between the germ lines of both sexes. The rate of elimination of elements from the Y rDNA array was twice that of the X rDNA array with both chromosomal loci containing regions where the rate of elimination was on average eight times higher. Most R1 and R2 eliminations appear to occur by large intrachromosomal events (i.e., loop-out events) that involve multiple rDNA units. These findings are interpreted in light of the known abundance of R1 and R2 elements in the X and Y rDNA loci of D. melanogaster.",2003,"César E Pérez-González, William D Burke, Thomas H Eickbush"

Successful transformation in D. simulans indicates that the P element continues to function as a transposable element in the D. simulans genome. Moreover, the ry+ gene of D. melanogaster functions in the genome of D. simulans to produce normal eye color, despite the estimated 1 to 5 million yr of reproductive isolation since the evolutionary divergence of these species.

Small regulatory noncoding RNAs in Drosophila melanogaster: biogenesis and biological functions,32219422,10.1093/bfgp/elaa005,"RNA interference (RNAi) is an important phenomenon that has diverse genetic regulatory functions at the pre- and posttranscriptional levels. The major trigger for the RNAi pathway is double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). dsRNA is processed to generate various types of major small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that include microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster). Functionally, these small ncRNAs play critical roles in virtually all biological systems and developmental pathways. Identification and processing of dsRNAs and activation of RNAi machinery are the three major academic interests that surround RNAi research. Mechanistically, some of the important biological functions of RNAi are achieved through: (i) supporting genomic stability via degradation of foreign viral genomes; (ii) suppressing the movement of transposable elements and, most importantly, (iii) post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by miRNAs that contribute to regulation of epigenetic modifications such as heterochromatin formation and genome imprinting. Here, we review various routes of small ncRNA biogenesis, as well as different RNAi-mediated pathways in D. melanogaster with a particular focus on signaling pathways.

Regulatory aspects of esterase 6 activity variation in sibling Drosophila species,8360077,10.1038/hdy.1993.105,"Esterase 6 in Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila simulans and Drosophila mauritiana is produced in several life stages and diverse tissues, but the major pulse of expression is in the sperm ejaculatory duct of adult males. Comparison of EST6 activity levels among several lines of D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. mauritiana reveals two major quantitative differences among the species. First, newly eclosed females of both D. simulans and D. mauritiana show significantly higher EST6 activity than those of D. melanogaster. Secondly, 5-day-old adult D. simulans have significantly higher activities than D. mauritiana in both sexes and significantly higher activity than D. melanogaster in males. The genetic bases of the differences between D. melanogaster and the other species are investigated through germ line transfer of the D. simulans and D. mauritiana Est-6 genes plus 1.2 kb of 5' and 0.2 kb of their 3' flanking sequences into D. melanogaster. The newly eclosed female activities of the transformants resemble those of the two donor species, suggesting that the interspecific differences in this aspect of expression are due to cis-inherited factors contained within the transferred DNA. In contrast, the 5-day adult activity of the D. simulans transgene resembles the recipient species, D. melanogaster, suggesting that the difference between D. simulans and D. melanogaster in this aspect of expression is due to trans-acting factors. We also find that third instar larval activities of the D. simulans transgene and 5-day male activities of the D. mauritiana transgene are lower than those of either parental species, suggesting that not all the promoter elements relevant to these aspects of expression are included in the transferred DNA.",1993,"J Karotam, J G Oakeshott"

On the other hand, when an injection of non-pathogenic bacteria, Escherichia coli, is performed 1 day before challenge with the entomopathogenic bacteria, then the survival of Drosophila flies was prolonged by at least 20h. After injection of entomopathogenic bacteria, Drosophila mutant Dif(1), affected on the Toll pathway, showed a similar phenotype than wild-type flies whereas Drosophila mutant Dredd(D55), affected on the imd pathway, was not protected by a prior injection of E. coli. This suggested that members of the imd pathway might be targets of these entomopathogenic bacteria albeit synthesis of antimicrobial peptides through this signaling pathway was induced by X. nematophila as well as P. luminescens. Finally, P. luminescens phoP mutant, an avirulent mutant in the Lepidopteran insect, Spodoptera littoralis, was found poorly virulent for D. melanogaster. phoP mutant partially protected D. melanogaster flies if injected 1 day before the injection of P. luminescens wild-type TT01 to the same extent than the E. coli-induced protection.

The Drosophila melanogaster Metabolic Response against Parasitic Nematode Infection Is Mediated by TGF-β Signaling,32610560,10.3390/microorganisms8070971,"The nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, its mutualistic bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens, and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster establish a unique system to study the basis of infection in relation to host metabolism. Our previous results indicate that the Transforming Growth Factor β (TGF-β) signaling pathway participates in the D. melanogaster metabolic response against nematode parasitism. However, our understanding of whether the presence of Photorhabdus bacteria in Heterorhabditis nematodes affects the metabolic state of D. melanogaster during infection is limited. Here, we investigated the involvement of TGF-β signaling branches, Activin and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP), in the D. melanogaster metabolic response against axenic (lacking bacteria) or symbiotic (containing bacteria) H. bacteriophora infection. We show that BMP signaling mediates lipid metabolism against axenic or symbiotic H. bacteriophora and alters the size of fat body lipid droplets against symbiotic nematode infection. Also, following symbiotic H. bacteriophora infection, Activin signaling modulates sugar metabolism. Our results indicate that Activin and BMP signaling interact with the D. melanogaster metabolic response to H. bacteriophora infection regardless of the presence or absence of Photorhabdus. These findings provide evidence for the role of TGF-β signaling in host metabolism, which could lead to the development of novel treatments for parasitic diseases.",2020,"Yaprak Ozakman, Trishya Pagadala, Dhaivat Raval, Ioannis Eleftherianos"

Furthermore, comparison of these sequences with those of the homologous region of D. simulans and D. mauritiana allows us to infer the pattern of evolutionary change of the D. melanogaster sequences. The integrity of the Adh-f electrophoretic alleles as a single lineage is supported by both unweighted pair-group method (UPGMA) and parsimony analyses. However, considerable divergence among the Adh-s lines seems to have preceded the origin of the Adh-f allele. Comparisons of the sequences of D. melanogaster genes with those of D. simulans and D. mauritiana genes suggest that the split between the latter two species occurred more recently than the divergence of some of the present-day Adh-s genes in D. melanogaster. The phylogenetic analyses of the D. melanogaster sequences show that the fast-slow distinction is not perfect, and suggest that intragenic recombination or gene conversion occurred in the evolution of this locus. We extended conventional phylogenetic analyses by using a statistical technique for detecting and characterizing recombination events. We show that the pattern of differentiation of DNA sequences in D. melanogaster is roughly compatible with the neutral theory of molecular evolution.",1985,"J C Stephens, M Nei"
Reconstructing the diversification of alpha-esterases: comparing the gene clusters of Drosophila buzzatii and D. melanogaster,10948271,10.1007/s002390010075,"A cluster composed of 10 active alpha-esterase genes and a pseudogene is distributed over 60 kb in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. This paper describes the corresponding cluster in Drosophila buzzatii, whose lineage diverged from that of D. melanogaster when the subgenera Drosophila and Sophophora diverged about 50 Mya. With three exceptions we find that the composition of the cluster is conserved in the two lineages. The location of alpha E1 in D. melanogaster differs from that of its nearest relative in D. buzzatii, and alpha E4 has duplicated independently in the two lineages. The nature of these differences indicates that a mechanism exists whereby copies of genes can be placed in opposite orientation and nonadjacent positions within a gene cluster, although this does not seem to be a feature of earlier events in the cluster's evolution. The rates of amino acid change are not significantly different between orthologs, but the rates differ sevenfold among paralogs, indicating that very different selective forces are acting on the genes of the cluster. Mapping of sequence differences onto a model of the tertiary structure of the enzymes indicates that motifs contributing to substrate binding and catalysis have changed radically in the alphaE4s and suggest that this subgroup of alpha-esterases may be evolving into a substantially different functional niche.",2000,"G C de Q Robin, C Claudianos, R J Russell, J G Oakeshott"
Wolbachia variants induce differential protection to viruses in Drosophila melanogaster: a phenotypic and phylogenomic analysis,24348259,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003896,"Wolbachia are intracellular bacterial symbionts that are able to protect various insect hosts from viral infections. This tripartite interaction was initially described in Drosophila melanogaster carrying wMel, its natural Wolbachia strain. wMel has been shown to be genetically polymorphic and there has been a recent change in variant frequencies in natural populations. We have compared the antiviral protection conferred by different wMel variants, their titres and influence on host longevity, in a genetically identical D. melanogaster host. The phenotypes cluster the variants into two groups--wMelCS-like and wMel-like. wMelCS-like variants give stronger protection against Drosophila C virus and Flock House virus, reach higher titres and often shorten the host lifespan. We have sequenced and assembled the genomes of these Wolbachia, and shown that the two phenotypic groups are two monophyletic groups. We have also analysed a virulent and over-replicating variant, wMelPop, which protects D. melanogaster even better than the closely related wMelCS. We have found that a ~21 kb region of the genome, encoding eight genes, is amplified seven times in wMelPop and may be the cause of its phenotypes. Our results indicate that the more protective wMelCS-like variants, which sometimes have a cost, were replaced by the less protective but more benign wMel-like variants. This has resulted in a recent reduction in virus resistance in D. melanogaster in natural populations worldwide. Our work helps to understand the natural variation in wMel and its evolutionary dynamics, and inform the use of Wolbachia in arthropod-borne disease control.",2013,"Ewa Chrostek, Marta S P Marialva, Sara S Esteves, Lucy A Weinert, Julien Martinez, Francis M Jiggins, Luis Teixeira"
Molecular evolution of the ocnus and janus genes in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup,11319264,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003862,"Genes involved in male fertility are potential targets for sexual selection, and their evolution may play a role in reproductive isolation and speciation. Here we describe a new Drosophila melanogaster gene, ocnus (ocn), that encodes a protein abundant in testes nuclear extracts. RT-PCR indicates that ocn transcription is limited to males and is specific to testes. ocn shares homology with another testis-specific gene, janusB (janB), and is located just distal to janB on chromosome 3. The two genes also share homology with the adjacent janusA (janA) gene, suggesting that multiple duplication events have occurred within this region of the genome. We cloned and sequenced these three genes from species of the D. melanogaster species subgroup. Phylogenetic analysis based on protein-encoding sequences predicts a duplication pattern of janA --> janA janB --> janA janB ocn, with the latter event occurring after the divergence of the D. melanogaster and Drosophila obscura species groups. We found significant heterogeneity in the rates of evolution among the three genes within the D. melanogaster species subgroup as measured by the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions, suggesting that diversification of gene function followed each duplication event and that each gene evolved under different selective constraints. All three genes showed faster rates of evolution than genes encoding proteins with metabolic function. These results are consistent with previous studies that have detected an increased rate of evolution in genes with reproductive function.",2001,"J Parsch, C D Meiklejohn, E Hauschteck-Jungen, P Hunziker, D L Hartl"
Robust manipulation of the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster by a fungal pathogen in the laboratory,30047862,10.7554/eLife.34414,"Many microbes induce striking behavioral changes in their animal hosts, but how they achieve this is poorly understood, especially at the molecular level. Mechanistic understanding has been largely constrained by the lack of an experimental system amenable to molecular manipulation. We recently discovered a strain of the behavior-manipulating fungal pathogen Entomophthora muscae infecting wild Drosophila, and established methods to infect D. melanogaster in the lab. Lab-infected flies manifest the moribund behaviors characteristic of E. muscae infection: hours before death, they climb upward, extend their proboscides, affixing in place, then raise their wings, clearing a path for infectious spores to launch from their abdomens. We found that E. muscae invades the nervous system, suggesting a direct means by which the fungus could induce behavioral changes. Given the vast molecular toolkit available for D. melanogaster, we believe this new system will enable rapid progress in understanding how E. muscae manipulates host behavior.",2018,"Carolyn Elya, Tin Ching Lok, Quinn E Spencer, Hayley McCausland, Ciera C Martinez, Michael Eisen"
Conservation of brown gene trans-inactivation in Drosophila,7635284,,"The mechanism underlying trans-inactivation associated with dominant position effect variegation (PEV) of the Drosophila melanogaster brown gene has been addressed by a comparison with its D. virilis homologue. This comparison revealed: 86% identity between conceptual translation products of the brown gene from these two species, functional homology, as the D. virilis gene rescues a D. melanogaster null brown mutation, and conservation of the sequences required for trans-inactivation, as the D. virilis gene in D. melanogaster is subject to dominant PEV. An extended region of sequence similarity upstream of the open reading frame is observed. As the D. virilis homologue is functionally interchangeable with the D. melanogaster gene, these genes must share regulatory sequences as well as protein coding homology. These results support a model in which trans-inactivation is mediated by a heterochromatin-sensitive transcription factor.",1995,"L E Martin-Morris, S Henikoff"
Levels of naturally occurring DNA polymorphism correlate with recombination rates in D. melanogaster,1560824,10.1038/356519a0,"Two genomic regions with unusually low recombination rates in Drosophila melanogaster have normal levels of divergence but greatly reduced nucleotide diversity, apparently resulting from the fixation of advantageous mutations and the associated hitch-hiking effect. Here we show that for 20 gene regions from across the genome, the amount of nucleotide diversity in natural populations of D. melanogaster is positively correlated with the regional rate of recombination. This cannot be explained by variation in mutation rates and/or functional constraint, because we observe no correlation between recombination rates and DNA sequence divergence between D. melanogaster and its sibling species, D. simulans. We suggest that the correlation may result from genetic hitch-hiking associated with the fixation of advantageous mutants. Hitch-hiking thus seems to occur over a large fraction of the Drosophila genome and may constitute a major constraint on levels of genetic variation in nature.",1992,"D J Begun, C F Aquadro"

The Drosophila melanogaster Eip74EF-PA transcription factor directly binds the sciarid BhC4-1 promoter,28971561,10.1002/dvg.23075,"The DNA puff BhC4-1 gene of Bradysia hygida (Diptera, Sciaridae) is amplified and expressed in the salivary glands at the end of the last larval instar. Even though there are no BhC4-1 orthologs in Drosophila melanogaster, the mechanisms that regulate BhC4-1 gene expression in B. hygida are for the most part conserved in D. melanogaster. The BhC4-1 promoter contains a 129bp (-186/-58) cis-regulatory module (CRM) that drives developmentally regulated expression in transgenic salivary glands at the onset of metamorphosis. Both in the sciarid and in transgenic D. melanogaster, BhC4-1 gene expression is induced by the increase in ecdysone titers that triggers metamorphosis. Genetic interaction experiments revealed that in the absence of the Eip74EF-PA early gene isoform BhC4-1-lacZ levels of expression in the salivary gland are severely reduced. Here we show that the overexpression of the Eip74EF-PA transcription factor is sufficient to anticipate BhC4-1-lacZ expression in transgenic D. melanogaster. Through yeast one-hybrid assays we confirm that the Eip74EF-PA transcription factor directly binds to the 129 bp sciarid CRM. Together, these results contribute to the characterization of an insect CRM and indicate that the ecdysone gene regulatory network that promotes metamorphosis is conserved between D. melanogaster and the sciarid B. hygida.",2017,"Henrique Oliveira Frank, Danilo Garcia Sanchez, Lucas de Freitas Oliveira, Jörg Kobarg, Nadia Monesi"
Cyanide binding and heme cavity conformational transitions in Drosophila melanogaster hexacoordinate hemoglobin,16906763,10.1021/bi060462a,"The reason for the presence of hemoglobin-like molecules in insects, such as Drosophila melanogaster, that live in fully aerobic environments has yet to be determined. Heme endogenous hexacoordination (where HisE7 and HisF8 axial ligands to the heme Fe atom are both provided by the protein) is a recently discovered mechanism proposed to modulate O(2) affinity in hemoglobins from different species. Previous results have shown that D. melanogaster hemoglobin 1 (product of the glob1 gene) displays heme endogenous hexacoordination in both the ferrous and ferric states. Here we present kinetic data characterizing the exogenous cyanide ligand binding process, and the three-dimensional structure (at 1.4 A resolution) of the ensuing cyano-met D. melanogaster hemoglobin. Comparison with the crystal structure of the endogenously hexacoordinated D. melanogaster hemoglobin shows that the transition to the cyano-met form is supported by conformational readjustment in the CD-D-E region of the protein, which removes HisE7 from the heme. The structural and functional features of D. melanogaster hemoglobin are examined in light of previous results achieved for human and mouse neuroglobins and for human cytoglobin, which display heme endogenous hexacoordination. The study shows that, despite the rather constant value for cyanide association rate constants for the ferric hemoproteins, different distal site conformational readjustments and/or heme sliding mechanisms are displayed by the known hexacoordinate hemoglobins as a result of exogenous ligand binding.",2006,"Daniele de Sanctis, Paolo Ascenzi, Alessio Bocedi, Sylvia Dewilde, Thorsten Burmester, Thomas Hankeln, Luc Moens, Martino Bolognesi"

We observed typical to Anncaliia spp. features of ultrastructure and cell pathology including spore morphology, characteristic extensions of the plasma membrane, and presence of ""ridges"" and appendages of tubular material at proliferative stages. Anncaliia algerae development in D. melanogaster was particularly similar to one of A. algerae and A.(Brachiola) vesicularum in humans with acute myositis.

Widespread polymorphism in the positions of stop codons in Drosophila melanogaster,22051795,10.1093/gbe/evr113,"The mechanisms underlying evolutionary changes in protein length are poorly understood. Protein domains are lost and gained between species and must have arisen first as within-species polymorphisms. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster population genomic data combined with between species divergence information to understand the evolutionary forces that generate and maintain polymorphisms causing changes in protein length in D. melanogaster. Specifically, we looked for protein length variations resulting from premature termination codons (PTCs) and stop codon losses (SCLs). We discovered that 438 genes contained polymorphisms resulting in truncation of the translated region (PTCs) and 119 genes contained polymorphisms predicted to lengthen the translated region (SCLs). Stop codon polymorphisms (SCPs) (especially PTCs) appear to be more deleterious than other polymorphisms, including protein amino acid changes. Genes harboring SCPs are in general less selectively constrained, more narrowly expressed, and enriched for dispensable biological functions. However, we also observed exceptional cases such as genes that have multiple independent SCPs, alleles that are shared between D. melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, and high-frequency alleles that cause extreme changes in gene length. SCPs likely have an important role in the evolution of these genes.",2012,"Yuh Chwen G Lee, Josephine A Reinhardt"
The involvement of catalase in alcohol metabolism in Drosophila melanogaster larvae,1910297,10.1016/0003-9861(91)90396-z,"The involvement of catalase (H2O2:H2O2 oxidoreductase, EC 1.11.1.6) in the metabolism of alcohols was investigated by comparing Drosophila melanogaster larvae in which catalase was inhibited by dietary 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3AT) to larvae fed a diet without 3AT. 3AT inhibited up to 80% of the catalase activity with concordant small increases in the in vitro activities of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, fumarase, and malic enzyme, but with a 16% reduction in the in vivo incorporation of label from [14C]glucose into lipid. When the catalase activity was inhibited to different degrees in ADH-null larvae, there was a simple linear correlation between the catalase activity and flux from [14C]ethanol into lipid. By feeding alcohols simultaneously with 3AT, ethanol and methanol were shown to react efficiently with catalase in wild-type larvae at moderately low dietary concentrations. Drosophila catalase did not react with other longer chain alcohols. Catalase apparently represents a minor pathway for ethanol degradation in D. melanogaster larvae, but it may be an important route for methanol elimination from D. melanogaster larvae.",1991,"A van der Zel, R Dadoo, B W Geer, P W Heinstra"
Voltages and resistances of the anterior Malpighian tubule of Drosophila melanogaster,31043456,10.1242/jeb.201574,"The small size of Malpighian tubules in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has discouraged measurements of the transepithelial electrical resistance. The present study introduces two methods for measuring the transepithelial resistance in isolated D . melanogaster Malpighian tubules using conventional microelectrodes and PClamp hardware and software. The first method uses three microelectrodes to measure the specific transepithelial resistance normalized to tubule length or luminal surface area for comparison with resistances of other epithelia. The second method uses only two microelectrodes to measure the relative resistance for comparing before and after effects in a single Malpighian tubule. Knowledge of the specific transepithelial resistance allows the first electrical model of electrolyte secretion by the main segment of the anterior Malpighian tubule of D . melanogaster The electrical model is remarkably similar to that of the distal Malpighian tubule of Aedes aegypti when tubules of Drosophila and Aedes are studied in vitro under the same experimental conditions.

Downregulation of the dopamine D2-like receptor in corpus allatum affects juvenile hormone synthesis in Drosophila melanogaster females,22206888,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.12.006,"In Drosophila, juvenile hormone (JH) is synthesized de novo in the specialized endocrine gland, corpusallatum (CA). Dopamine (DA) controls JH levels by either stimulating or inhibiting its synthesis and degradation depending on the developmental stage. The present study focuses on the role of D2-like receptors in the regulation of JH synthesis by dopamine. We show that D2-like receptors (DD2R) are expressed in CA cells of Drosophila melanogaster females. In addition, the level of JH production was analyzed in D. melanogaster females with decreased DD2R expression in CA (vs. corresponding control flies) by assessing multiple indices of JH synthesis (JH-hydrolyzing activity and stress reactivity of the system of JH metabolism, activity and stress reactivity of the alkaline phosphatase, activity and stress reactivity of the tyrosine decarboxylase). The differential value obtained for each index suggests increased JH production in female flies that downregulate DD2R. Based on these findings, we postulate that the DA inhibiting effect on the JH synthesis in D. melanogaster is mediated at least in part via D2-like receptors.",2012,"N Е Gruntenko, O V Laukhina, E V Bogomolova, E K Karpova, P N Menshanov, I V Romanova, I Yu Rauschenbach"
Evaluation of toxicity and genotoxic effects of spinosad and deltamethrin in Drosophila melanogaster and Bactrocera oleae,21626654,10.1002/ps.2208,"Background:
      
    

    
      The insecticides spinosad and deltamethrin are being increasingly used in pest management programmes. In order to assess further their toxic effects to target and non-target insect species, an evaluation was made of their insecticidal profile on Bactrocera oleae (Rossi) and Drosophila melanogaster (Meig.). Moreover, possible genotoxic effects of the two pesticides were investigated using the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in D. melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Both insecticides were highly effective against B. oleae, exhibiting similar LC(50) values. Moreover, they were found to be more effective against Bactrocera than against Drosophila adults.

Nucleotide variation at the no-on-transient A gene in Drosophila littoralis,11813105,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800006,"The no-on-transient A (nonA) gene encodes a putative RNA-binding protein, and mutations in this gene are known to affect vision, male courtship song and viability in Drosophila melanogaster.

All portions of nonA appeared to be conserved between D. littoralis and D. virilis, while the 5' region of the gene of these two species showed high divergence from that of a more distantly-related species, D. melanogaster. The same was true for the glycine repeat regions. No significant deviation from neutrality was observed in the analysis of intraspecific nucleotide variation in 5' or 3' region of the nonA gene in D. littoralis population. Also, comparison of D. littoralis sequences with homologous sequence of D. virilis suggests that the gene is evolving neutrally in D. virilis group.

The molecular chaperone Hsp70 from the thermotolerant Diptera species differs from the Drosophila paralog in its thermostability and higher refolding capacity at extreme temperatures,31664698,10.1007/s12192-019-01038-3,"Previously, we demonstrated that species of the Stratiomyidae family exhibit higher tolerance to thermal stress in comparison with that of many representatives of Diptera, including Drosophila species. We hypothesized that species of this group inherited the specific structures of their chaperones from an ancestor of the Stratiomyidae family, and this enabled the descendants to colonize various extreme habitats. To explore this possibility, we cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli copies of the Hsp70 genes from Stratiomys singularior, a typical eurythermal species, and Drosophila melanogaster, for comparison. To investigate the thermal sensitivity of the chaperone function of the inducible 70-kDa heat shock proteins from these species, we used an in vitro refolding luciferase assay. We demonstrated that under conditions of elevated temperature, S. singularior Hsp70 exhibited higher reactivation activity in comparison with D. melanogaster Hsp70 and even human Hsp70. Similarly, S. singularior Hsp70 was significantly more thermostable and showed in vitro refolding activity after preheatment at higher temperatures than D. melanogaster paralog. Thermally induced unfolding experiments using differential scanning calorimetry indicated that Hsp70 from both Diptera species is formed by two domains with different thermal stabilities and that the ATP-binding domain of S. singularior is stable at temperatures 4 degrees higher than that of the D. melanogaster paralog. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first report that provides direct experimental data indicating that the evolutionary history of a species may result in adaptive changes in the structures of chaperones to enable them to elicit protective functions at extreme environments.",2019,"David G Garbuz, Dmitry Sverchinsky, Artem Davletshin, Boris A Margulis, Vladimir Mitkevich, Aleksei M Kulikov, Michael B Evgen'ev"
Low temperature reveals genetic variability against male-killing Spiroplasma in Drosophila melanogaster natural populations,24121800,10.1007/s00248-013-0295-z,"Spiroplasma endosymbionts are maternally inherited microorganisms which infect many arthropod species. In some Drosophila species, it acts as a reproductive manipulator, spreading in populations by killing the sons of infected mothers. Distinct Drosophila melanogaster populations from Brazil exhibit variable male-killing Spiroplasma prevalences. In this study, we investigated the presence of variability for the male-killing phenotype among Drosophila and/or Spiroplasma strains and verified if it correlates with the endosymbiont prevalence in natural populations. For that, we analyzed the male-killing expression when Spiroplasma strains from different populations were transferred to a standard D. melanogaster line (Canton-S) and when a common Spiroplasma strain was transferred to different wild-caught D. melanogaster lines, both at optimal and challenging temperatures for the bacteria. No variation was observed in the male-killing phenotype induced by different Spiroplasma strains. No phenotypic variability among fly lines was detected at optimal temperature (23 °C), as well. Conversely, significant variation in the male-killing expression was revealed among D. melanogaster lines at 18.5 °C, probably caused by imperfect transmission of the endosymbiont. Distinct lines differed in their average sex ratios as well as in the pattern of male-killing expression as the infected females aged. Greater variation occurred among lines from one locality, although there was no clear correlation between the male-killing intensity and the endosymbiont prevalence in each population. Imperfect transmission or male killing may also occur in the field, thus helping to explain the low or intermediate prevalences reported in nature. We discuss the implications of our results for the dynamics of male-killing Spiroplasma in natural populations.",2014,"Iuri Matteuzzo Ventura, Thais Costa, Louis Bernard Klaczko"
Population genomics of transposable elements in Drosophila melanogaster,21172826,10.1093/molbev/msq337,"Transposable elements (TEs) are the primary contributors to the genome bulk in many organisms and are major players in genome evolution. A clear and thorough understanding of the population dynamics of TEs is therefore essential for full comprehension of the eukaryotic genome evolution and function. Although TEs in Drosophila melanogaster have received much attention, population dynamics of most TE families in this species remains entirely unexplored. It is not clear whether the same population processes can account for the population behaviors of all TEs in Drosophila or whether, as has been suggested previously, different orders behave according to very different rules. In this work, we analyzed population frequencies for a large number of individual TEs (755 TEs) in five North American and one sub-Saharan African D. melanogaster populations (75 strains in total). These TEs have been annotated in the reference D. melanogaster euchromatic genome and have been sampled from all three major orders (non-LTR, LTR, and TIR) and from all families with more than 20 TE copies (55 families in total). We find strong evidence that TEs in Drosophila across all orders and families are subject to purifying selection at the level of ectopic recombination. We showed that strength of this selection varies predictably with recombination rate, length of individual TEs, and copy number and length of other TEs in the same family. Importantly, these rules do not appear to vary across orders. Finally, we built a statistical model that considered only individual TE-level (such as the TE length) and family-level properties (such as the copy number) and were able to explain more than 40% of the variation in TE frequencies in D. melanogaster.",2011,"Dmitri A Petrov, Anna-Sophie Fiston-Lavier, Mikhail Lipatov, Kapa Lenkov, Josefa González"

By performing a quantitative proteomic analysis, we identified 79 differentially expressed proteins in comparing Dacer mutant to wild type. Three oxidoreductases, including two cytochrome P450 (CG3050, CG9438) and an oxoglutarate/iron-dependent dioxygenase (CG17807), were most significantly upregulated in Dacer mutant.

Here we describe ADH activity and Adh expression level upon selection for increased alcohol tolerance in different life-stages of D. melanogaster lines with two distinct Adh genotypes: Adh(FF) and Adh(SS). We demonstrate a positive within genotype response for increased alcohol tolerance. Life-stage dependent selection was observed in larvae only. A slight constitutive increase in adult ADH activity for all selection regimes and genotypes was observed, that was not paralleled by Adh expression. Larval Adh expression showed a constitutive increase, that was not reflected in ADH activity. Upon exposure to environmental ethanol, sex, selection regime life stage and genotype appear to have differential effects. Increased ADH activity accompanies increased ethanol tolerance in D. melanogaster but this increase is not paralleled by expression of the Adh gene.",2005,"Y Malherbe, A Kamping, W van Delden, L van de Zande"
Isolation and characterization of the Drosophila melanogaster eIF-2 alpha gene encoding the alpha subunit of translation initiation factor eIF-2,8144032,10.1016/0378-1119(94)90550-9,"Genomic and cDNA clones encoding the Drosophila melanogaster alpha-subunit of translational initiation factor 2 (eIF-2 alpha) were isolated.

The regulatory phosphorylation site at Ser50 is embedded in a segment of 19 conserved aa residues. Analysis of the genomic DNA and cDNA clones indicated that eIF-2 alpha is a single-copy gene and its coding region is interrupted by a 260-bp intron.

Genetic rescue of inviable hybrids between Drosophila melanogaster and its sibling species,3108667,10.1038/327331a0,"Post-mating mechanisms are central to the establishment of reproductive isolation between different, but closely related, species. Post-mating isolation mechanisms include hybrid breakdown, hybrid sterility and hybrid lethality and may, in some cases, be reinforced by pre-mating mechanisms such as ethological differentiation. In the Drosophila melanogaster species sub-group post-mating reproductive isolation is ensured by both the inviability and the sterility of hybrids. For example when D. melanogaster females are crossed to D. simulans males the hybrid progeny are normally all female; the hybrid males die as third instar larvae. The viable hybrid females are totally sterile. Little is known of the genetic basis for either hybrid sterility or hybrid inviability, although Coyne and others have begun a genetic analysis of the sterility of hybrids within this species sub-group. We have discovered a single gene difference that rescues the otherwise inviable male hybrids from the cross between D. melanogaster females and males of its three closest relatives. The study of this locus may shed light on the genetic control of both speciation and development.",1987,"P Hutter, M Ashburner"
Wolbachia influences the maternal transmission of the gypsy endogenous retrovirus in Drosophila melanogaster,25182324,10.1128/mBio.01529-14,"The endosymbiotic bacteria of the genus Wolbachia are present in most insects and are maternally transmitted through the germline. Moreover, these intracellular bacteria exert antiviral activity against insect RNA viruses, as in Drosophila melanogaster, which could explain the prevalence of Wolbachia bacteria in natural populations. Wolbachia is maternally transmitted in D. melanogaster through a mechanism that involves distribution at the posterior pole of mature oocytes and then incorporation into the pole cells of the embryos. In parallel, maternal transmission of several endogenous retroviruses is well documented in D. melanogaster. Notably, gypsy retrovirus is expressed in permissive follicle cells and transferred to the oocyte and then to the offspring by integrating into their genomes. Here, we show that the presence of Wolbachia wMel reduces the rate of gypsy insertion into the ovo gene. However, the presence of Wolbachia does not modify the expression levels of gypsy RNA and envelope glycoprotein from either permissive or restrictive ovaries. Moreover, Wolbachia affects the pattern of distribution of the retroviral particles and the gypsy envelope protein in permissive follicle cells. Altogether, our results enlarge the knowledge of the antiviral activity of Wolbachia to include reducing the maternal transmission of endogenous retroviruses in D. melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Importance:
      
    

    
      Animals have established complex relationships with bacteria and viruses that spread horizontally among individuals or are vertically transmitted, i.e., from parents to offspring. It is well established that members of the genus Wolbachia, maternally inherited symbiotic bacteria present mainly in arthropods, reduce the replication of several RNA viruses transmitted horizontally. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that Wolbachia diminishes the maternal transmission of gypsy, an endogenous retrovirus in Drosophila melanogaster. We hypothesize that gypsy cannot efficiently integrate into the germ cells of offspring during embryonic development in the presence of Wolbachia because both are competitors for localization to the posterior pole of the egg. More generally, it would be of interest to analyze the influence of Wolbachia on vertically transmitted exogenous viruses, such as some arboviruses.",2014,"Franck Touret, François Guiguen, Christophe Terzian"
Recurrent Collection of Drosophila melanogaster from Wild African Environments and Genomic Insights into Species History,31730190,10.1093/molbev/msz271,"A long-standing enigma concerns the geographic and ecological origins of the intensively studied vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This globally distributed human commensal is thought to originate from sub-Saharan Africa, yet until recently, it had never been reported from undisturbed wilderness environments that could reflect its precommensal niche. Here, we document the collection of 288 D. melanogaster individuals from multiple African wilderness areas in Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Namibia. The presence of D. melanogaster in these remote woodland environments is consistent with an ancestral range in southern-central Africa, as opposed to equatorial regions. After sequencing the genomes of 17 wilderness-collected flies collected from Kafue National Park in Zambia, we found reduced genetic diversity relative to town populations, elevated chromosomal inversion frequencies, and strong differences at specific genes including known insecticide targets. Combining these genomes with existing data, we probed the history of this species' geographic expansion. Demographic estimates indicated that expansion from southern-central Africa began ∼10,000 years ago, with a Saharan crossing soon after, but expansion from the Middle East into Europe did not begin until roughly 1,400 years ago. This improved model of demographic history will provide an important resource for future evolutionary and genomic studies of this key model organism.

Endosymbiont-based immunity in Drosophila melanogaster against parasitic nematode infection,29466376,10.1371/journal.pone.0192183,"Associations between endosymbiotic bacteria and their hosts represent a complex ecosystem within organisms ranging from humans to protozoa. Drosophila species are known to naturally harbor Wolbachia and Spiroplasma endosymbionts, which play a protective role against certain microbial infections. Here, we investigated whether the presence or absence of endosymbionts affects the immune response of Drosophila melanogaster larvae to infection by Steinernema carpocapsae nematodes carrying or lacking their mutualistic Gram-negative bacteria Xenorhabdus nematophila (symbiotic or axenic nematodes, respectively). We find that the presence of Wolbachia alone or together with Spiroplasma promotes the survival of larvae in response to infection with S. carpocapsae symbiotic nematodes, but not against axenic nematodes. We also find that Wolbachia numbers are reduced in Spiroplasma-free larvae infected with axenic compared to symbiotic nematodes, and they are also reduced in Spiroplasma-containing compared to Spiroplasma-free larvae infected with axenic nematodes. We further show that S. carpocapsae axenic nematode infection induces the Toll pathway in the absence of Wolbachia, and that symbiotic nematode infection leads to increased phenoloxidase activity in D. melanogaster larvae devoid of endosymbionts. Finally, infection with either type of nematode alters the metabolic status and the fat body lipid droplet size in D. melanogaster larvae containing only Wolbachia or both endosymbionts. Our results suggest an interaction between Wolbachia endosymbionts with the immune response of D. melanogaster against infection with the entomopathogenic nematodes S. carpocapsae. Results from this study indicate a complex interplay between insect hosts, endosymbiotic microbes and pathogenic organisms.",2018,"Shruti Yadav, Joanna Frazer, Ashima Banga, Katherine Pruitt, Sneh Harsh, John Jaenike, Ioannis Eleftherianos"
Recurrent deletion and gene presence/absence polymorphism: telomere dynamics dominate evolution at the tip of 3L in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans,18505885,10.1534/genetics.107.078345,"Although Drosophila melanogaster has been the subject of intensive analysis of polymorphism and divergence, little is known about the distribution of variation at the most distal regions of chromosomes arms. Here we report a survey of genetic variation on the tip of 3L in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Levels of single nucleotide polymorphism in the most distal euchromatic sequence are approximately one order of magnitude less than that typically observed in genomic regions of normal crossing over, consistent with what might be expected under models of linked selection in regions of low crossing over. However, despite this reduced level of nucleotide variation, we found abundant deletion polymorphism. These deletions create at least three gene presence/absence polymorphisms within D. melanogaster: the putative G-protein coupled receptor mthl-8 (which is the most distal known or predicted gene on 3L) and the unannotated mRNAs AY060886 and BT006009. Strikingly, D. simulans is also segregating deletions that cause mthl8 presence/absence polymorphism. Breakpoint sequencing and tests of correlations with segregating SNPs in D. melanogaster suggest that each deletion is unique. Cloned breakpoint sequences revealed the presence of Het-A elements just distal to unique, canonical euchromatic sequences. This pattern suggests a model in which repeated telomeric deficiencies cause deletions of euchromatic sequence followed by subsequent ""healing"" by retrotranposition of Het-A elements. These data reveal the dominance of telomeric dynamics on the evolution of closely linked sequences in Drosophila.",2008,"Andrew D Kern, David J Begun"
"DmGEN, a novel RAD2 family endo-exonuclease from Drosophila melanogaster",15576351,10.1093/nar/gkh962,"A novel endo-exonuclease, DmGEN (Drosophila Melanogaster XPG-like endonuclease), was identified in D.melanogaster. DmGEN is composed of five exons and four introns, and the open reading frame encodes a predicted product of 726 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 82.5 kDa and a pI of 5.36. The gene locus on Drosophila polytene chromosomes was detected at 64C9 on the left arm of chromosome 3 as a single site. The encoded protein showed a relatively high degree of sequence homology with the RAD2 nucleases, especially XPG. Although the XPG-N- and XPG-I-domains are highly conserved in sequence, locations of the domains are similar to those of FEN-1 and EXO-1, and the molecular weight of the protein is close to that of EXO-1. In vitro, DmGEN showed endonuclease and 3'-5' exonuclease activities with both single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), but the endonuclease action with dsDNA was quite specific: 5'-3' exonuclease activity was found to occur with nicked DNA, while dsDNA was endonucleolytically cut at 3-4 bp from the 5' end. Homologs are widely found in mammals and higher plants.

Analysis of nucleotide substitutions of mitochondrial DNAs in Drosophila melanogaster and its sibling species,2832697,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040464,"To study the rate and pattern of nucleotide substitution in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), we cloned and sequenced a 975-bp segment of mtDNA from Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. mauritiana containing the genes for three transfer RNAs and parts of two protein-coding genes, ND2 and COI. Statistical analysis of synonymous substitutions revealed a predominance of transitions over transversions among the three species, a finding differing from previous results obtained from a comparison of D. melanogaster and D. yakuba. The number of transitions observed was nearly the same for each species comparison, including D. yakuba, despite the differences in divergence times. However, transversions seemed to increase steadily with increasing divergence time. By contrast, nonsynonymous substitutions in the ND2 gene showed a predominance of transversions over transitions. Most transversions were between A and T and seemed to be due to some kind of mutational bias to which the A + T-rich mtDNA of Drosophila species may be subject. The overall rate of nucleotide substitution in Drosophila mtDNA appears to be slightly faster (approximately 1.4 times) than that of the Adh gene. This contrasts with the result obtained for mammals, in which the mtDNA evolves approximately 10 times faster than single-copy nuclear DNA. We have also shown that the start codon of the COI gene is GTGA in D. simulans and GTAA in D. mauritiana. These codons are different from that of D. melanogaster (ATAA).",1987,"Y Satta, H Ishiwa, S I Chigusa"

Increased apoptosis in cells of eye and wing discs was found to be associated with flubendiamide (fluoride containing insecticide) exposure (at the range 0.25-10μg/mL) in D. melanogaster larvae. The chemical fed larvae on attaining adulthood revealed alterations in morphology and symmetry of their compound eyes and wings through scanning electron microscopy. Nearly 40% and 30% of flies (P generation) demonstrated alterations in eyes and wings respectively. Transmission electron microscopic study (at the range 1-20μg/mL) also established variation in the rhabdomere and pigment cell orientation as well as in the shape of the ommatidium. Subsequent SEM study with F1 and F2 generation flies also revealed structural variation in eye and wing. Decrease in percentage of altered eye and wing phenotype was noted in subsequent generations (P> F1>F2). Thus, the diamide insecticide, flubendiamide, expected to be environmentally safe at sub-lethal concentrations was found to increase apoptosis in larvae and thereby cause morphological alteration in the adult D. melanogaster.

Evolution of dosage compensation in Diptera: the gene maleless implements dosage compensation in Drosophila (Brachycera suborder) but its homolog in Sciara (Nematocera suborder) appears to play no role in dosage compensation,11102379,,"In Drosophila melanogaster and in Sciara ocellaris dosage compensation occurs by hypertranscription of the single male X chromosome. This article reports the cloning and characterization in S. ocellaris of the gene homologous to maleless (mle) of D. melanogaster, which implements dosage compensation. The Sciara mle gene produces a single transcript, encoding a helicase, which is present in both male and female larvae and adults and in testes and ovaries. Both Sciara and Drosophila MLE proteins are highly conserved. The affinity-purified antibody to D. melanogaster MLE recognizes the S. ocellaris MLE protein. In contrast to Drosophila polytene chromosomes, where MLE is preferentially associated with the male X chromosome, in Sciara MLE is found associated with all chromosomes. Anti-MLE staining of Drosophila postblastoderm male embryos revealed a single nuclear dot, whereas Sciara male and female embryos present multiple intranuclear staining spots. This expression pattern in Sciara is also observed before blastoderm stage, when dosage compensation is not yet set up. The affinity-purified antibodies against D. melanogaster MSL1, MSL3, and MOF proteins involved in dosage compensation also revealed no differences in the staining pattern between the X chromosome and the autosomes in both Sciara males and females.

"Evolution of herbivory in Drosophilidae linked to loss of behaviors, antennal responses, odorant receptors, and ancestral diet",25624509,10.1073/pnas.1424656112,"Herbivory is a key innovation in insects, yet has only evolved in one-third of living orders. The evolution of herbivory likely involves major behavioral changes mediated by remodeling of canonical chemosensory modules. Herbivorous flies in the genus Scaptomyza (Drosophilidae) are compelling species in which to study the genomic architecture linked to the transition to herbivory because they recently evolved from microbe-feeding ancestors and are closely related to Drosophila melanogaster. We found that Scaptomyza flava, a leaf-mining specialist on plants in the family (Brassicaceae), was not attracted to yeast volatiles in a four-field olfactometer assay, whereas D. melanogaster was strongly attracted to these volatiles. Yeast-associated volatiles, especially short-chain aliphatic esters, elicited strong antennal responses in D. melanogaster, but weak antennal responses in electroantennographic recordings from S. flava. We sequenced the genome of S. flava and characterized this species' odorant receptor repertoire. Orthologs of odorant receptors, which detect yeast volatiles in D. melanogaster and mediate critical host-choice behavior, were deleted or pseudogenized in the genome of S. flava. These genes were lost step-wise during the evolution of Scaptomyza. Additionally, Scaptomyza has experienced gene duplication and likely positive selection in paralogs of Or67b in D. melanogaster. Olfactory sensory neurons expressing Or67b are sensitive to green-leaf volatiles.

Transposable and nontransposable elements similar to the I factor involved in inducer-reactive (IR) hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster coexist in various Drosophila species,2829216,10.1073/pnas.85.4.1141,"The I factor is a transposable element controlling inducer-reactive (IR) hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, which occurs when males from the class of inducer strains are crossed with females from the class of reactive strains. Inducer strains contain several copies of the complete 5.4-kilobase (kb) I factor at various sites on the chromosomal arms; reactive strains contain no complete I factor. Incomplete and defective I elements occur at constant locations in pericentromeric heterochromatin of both types of strains. The 5.4-kb I factors transpose, whereas incomplete I elements do not transpose. The constant location of defective I elements in all strains indicates that they were in the genome before the spread of D. melanogaster throughout the world. Sequences homologous to I occur in other Drosophila species, and their distribution correlates with the phylogenetic relationships between species. We have studied the organization of I homologues in Drosophila simulans and Drosophila teissieri. These species seem to contain both transposable I elements, even though their structure may differ from that of the 5.4-kb I factors of the inducer strains of D. melanogaster, and nontransposable I elements, which are always at the same place in the genome when different stocks of the same species are compared.

Birth of a new gene on the Y chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster,26385968,10.1073/pnas.1516543112,"Contrary to the pattern seen in mammalian sex chromosomes, where most Y-linked genes have X-linked homologs, the Drosophila X and Y chromosomes appear to be unrelated. Most of the Y-linked genes have autosomal paralogs, so autosome-to-Y transposition must be the main source of Drosophila Y-linked genes. Here we show how these genes were acquired. We found a previously unidentified gene (flagrante delicto Y, FDY) that originated from a recent duplication of the autosomal gene vig2 to the Y chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster. Four contiguous genes were duplicated along with vig2, but they became pseudogenes through the accumulation of deletions and transposable element insertions, whereas FDY remained functional, acquired testis-specific expression, and now accounts for ∼20% of the vig2-like mRNA in testis. FDY is absent in the closest relatives of D. melanogaster, and DNA sequence divergence indicates that the duplication to the Y chromosome occurred ∼2 million years ago. Thus, FDY provides a snapshot of the early stages of the establishment of a Y-linked gene and demonstrates how the Drosophila Y has been accumulating autosomal genes.",2015,"Antonio Bernardo Carvalho, Beatriz Vicoso, Claudia A M Russo, Bonnielin Swenor, Andrew G Clark"

PCR testing of subsequent generations revealed that females retaining Spiroplasma infection continued to produce a large excess of female progeny, while females that had lost Spiroplasma produced offspring with normal sex ratios. Consistent with earlier work, we find that male-killing and transmission efficiency appear to increase with female age, and we note that males born in sex ratio broods display much lower survivorship than their female siblings.

A nonpeptide provides insight into mechanisms that regulate Drosophila melanogaster heart contractions,14706539,10.1016/j.peptides.2003.10.011,"Here we report the effect of a nonpeptide, benzethonium chloride (bztc), on Drosophila melanogaster larval, pupal, and adult heart rates in vivo.

When applied directly to the D. melanogaster heart, in the absence of hemolymph, bztc reduced the frequency of spontaneous contractions in larval, pupal, and adult hearts. These findings are consistent with the conclusion that bztc acts through or is regulated by different mechanisms in these three developmental stages. An alternative explanation is that larval hemolymph and adult hemolymph contain a material that interferes with the effect of the nonpeptide on heart contractions. Bztc mimicked the effect of the peptide dromyosuppressin (DMS) on the heart at an equivalent concentration; in contrast, 103-fold more nonpeptide is required to mimic the effect of DMS on fly gut.

Further studies of the structure and expression of the single calmodulin gene of D. melanogaster have established that the gene contains a tiny additional 5' exon encoding only 50 residues of the 5' leader.

Here we investigate starvation resistance and fat content in 10 populations from South America, in which clines in body size, egg size, and development time have previously been found. We find no evidence for a cline in starvation resistance or fat content in South America. We therefore suggest that the cline in starvation resistance in India may have evolved in response to specific climatic variation found only in India.",2000,"S J Robinson, B Zwaan, L Partridge"

The chromatids, however, seem to move to the poles in two separate groups in each half spindle, mingling together during telophase, before the formation of the daughter nuclei.

A role for nematocytes in the cellular immune response of the drosophilid Zaprionus indianus,24476764,10.1017/S0031182013001431,"The melanotic encapsulation response mounted by Drosophila melanogaster against macroparasites, which is based on haemocyte binding to foreign objects, is poorly characterized relative to its humoral immune response against microbes, and appears to be variable across insect lineages. The genus Zaprionus is a diverse clade of flies embedded within the genus Drosophila. Here we characterize the immune response of Zaprionus indianus against endoparasitoid wasp eggs, which elicit the melanotic encapsulation response in D. melanogaster. We find that Z. indianus is highly resistant to diverse wasp species. Although Z. indianus mounts the canonical melanotic encapsulation response against some wasps, it can also potentially fight off wasp infection using two other mechanisms: encapsulation without melanization and a non-cellular form of wasp killing. Zaprionus indianus produces a large number of haemocytes including nematocytes, which are large fusiform haemocytes absent in D. melanogaster, but which we found in several other species in the subgenus Drosophila. Several lines of evidence suggest these nematocytes are involved in anti-wasp immunity in Z. indianus and in particular in the encapsulation of wasp eggs. Altogether, our data show that the canonical anti-wasp immune response and haemocyte make-up of the model organism D. melanogaster vary across the genus Drosophila.",2014,"Balint Z Kacsoh, Julianna Bozler, Todd A Schlenke"
[Structural organization and distribution of symbiotic bacteria Wolbachia in early embryos and ovaries of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans],15214166,,"Electron microscopic and morphometric analyses of Wolbachia distribution in early embryos of Drosophila flies have demonstrated that the number of bacteria in the embryo remains constant from fertilization to blastoderm, and that afterwards the symbionts could be observed only in the polar cells. Each bacterium has a three-layer envelope, makes contacts with microtubules and moves through the cytoplasm following the actively dividing nuclei. It has been found for the first time that Wolbachia could produce secretory vacuoles in the cytoplasm of early embryos. The relative volume of Wolbachia was five times as much in the embryos of Drosophila simulans as in those of D. melanogaster (Canton S), while the survival rate of D. simulans was half as much as that of D. melanogaster. It was shown that Wolbachia could form spore-like structures in D. simulans embryos. Ultrastructural investigations of Drosophila ovaries suggest that the bacteria may be present in all ovariol cells, including the oocyte, within whose cytoplasm they are delivered to the host. The highest number of symbionts was observed in germarium cells. In ovariol cells, the bacteria gradually decrease in number as oogenesis progresses. It has been determined for the first time that the symbionts are located closely to membranes of rough endoplasmatic reticulum in follicular and nurse cells of D. melanogaster. The data obtained suggest that Wolbachia may be involved in the regulation of oocyte maturation.",2004,"N V Dudkina, D A Voronin, E V Kiseleva"
Evidence for recent horizontal transfer of gypsy-homologous LTR-retrotransposon gtwin into Drosophila erecta followed by its amplification with multiple aberrations,17459613,10.1016/j.gene.2007.02.019,"Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon gtwin was initially discovered in silico, and then it was isolated as gypsy-homologous sequence from Drosophila melanogaster strain, G32. The presence of ORF3 suggests, that gtwin, like gypsy, may be an endogenous retrovirus, which can leave the cell and infect another one. Therefore, in this study we decided to investigate the distribution of gtwin in different species of the melanogaster subgroup in order to find out whether gtwin can be transferred horizontally as well as vertically. Gtwin was found in all 9 species of this subgroup, hence it seems to have inhabited the host genomes for a long time. In addition, we have shown that in the Drosophila erecta genome two gtwin families are present. The first one has 93% of identity to D. melanogaster element and is likely to be a descendant of gtwin that existed in Drosophila before the divergence of the melanogaster subgroup species. The other one has >99% of identity to D. melanogaster gtwin. The most reasonable explanation is that this element has been recently horizontally transferred between D. melanogaster and D. erecta. The number and variety of gtwin copies from the ""infectious"" family suggest that after the horizontal transfer into D. erecta genome, gtwin underwent amplification and aberrations, leading to the rise of its diverse variants.",2007,"Alina P Kotnova, Ivan A Glukhov, Nina N Karpova, Veniamin B Salenko, Natalia V Lyubomirskaya, Yuriy V Ilyin"

Drosophila melanogaster as a function-based high-throughput screening model for antinephrolithiasis agents in kidney stone patients,30082495,10.1242/dmm.035873,"Kidney stone disease involves the aggregation of stone-forming salts consequent to solute supersaturation in urine. The development of novel therapeutic agents for this predominantly metabolic and biochemical disorder have been hampered by the lack of a practical pre-clinical model amenable to drug screening. Here, Drosophila melanogaster, an emerging model for kidney stone disease research, was adapted as a high-throughput functional drug screening platform independent of the multifactorial nature of mammalian nephrolithiasis. Through functional screening, the therapeutic potential of a novel compound commonly known as arbutin that specifically binds to oxalate, a key component of kidney calculi, was identified. Through isothermal titration calorimetry, high-performance liquid chromatography and atomic force microscopy, arbutin was determined to interact with calcium and oxalate in both free and bound states, disrupting crystal lattice structure, growth and crystallization. When used to treat patient urine samples, arbutin significantly abrogated calculus formation in vivo and outperformed potassium citrate in low pH urine conditions, owing to its oxalate-centric mode of action. The discovery of this novel antilithogenic compound via D. melanogaster, independent of a mammalian model, brings greater recognition to this platform, for which metabolic features are primary outcomes, underscoring the power of D. melanogaster as a high-throughput drug screening platform in similar disorders.

Analysis of immune-related genes during Nora virus infection of Drosophila melanogaster using next generation sequencing,29707694,10.3934/microbiol.2018.1.123,"Drosophila melanogaster depends upon the innate immune system to regulate and combat viral infection. This is a complex, yet widely conserved process that involves a number of immune pathways and gene interactions. In addition, expression of genes involved in immunity are differentially regulated as the organism ages. This is particularly true for viruses that demonstrate chronic infection, as is seen with Nora virus. Nora virus is a persistent non-pathogenic virus that replicates in a horizontal manner in D. melanogaster. The genes involved in the regulation of the immune response to Nora virus infection are largely unknown. In addition, the temporal response of immune response genes as a result of infection has not been examined. In this study, D. melanogaster either infected with Nora virus or left uninfected were aged for 2, 10, 20 and 30 days. The RNA from these samples was analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS) and the resulting immune-related genes evaluated by utilizing both the PANTHER and DAVID databases, as well as comparison to lists of immune related genes and FlyBase. The data demonstrate that Nora virus infected D. melanogaster exhibit an increase in immune related gene expression over time. In addition, at day 30, the data demonstrate that a persistent immune response may occur leading to an upregulation of specific immune response genes. These results demonstrate the utility of NGS in determining the potential immune system genes involved in Nora virus replication, chronic infection and involvement of antiviral pathways.",2018,"Wilfredo Lopez, Alexis M Page, Darby J Carlson, Brad L Ericson, Matyas F Cserhati, Chittibabu Guda, Kimberly A Carlson"

Diurnal rhythms of protein synthesis controlled by the biological clock underlie the rhythmic physiology in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, we conducted a proteome-wide investigation of rhythmic protein accumulation in D. melanogaster. Materials and Methods. Total protein collected from fly samples harvested at 4 h intervals over the 24 h period were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, trypsin digestion and MS/MS analysis. Protein spots/clusters were identified with MASCOT search engine and Swiss-Prot database. Expression of proteins was documented as percentage of volume contribution using the Image Master 2D Platinum software. Results. A total of 124 protein spots/clusters were identified using MS/MS analysis. Significant variation in the expression of 88 proteins over the 24-h period was observed. A relatively higher number of proteins was upregulated during the night compared to the daytime. The complexity of temporal regulation of the D. melanogaster proteome was further reflected from functional annotations of the differently expressed proteins, with those that were upregulated at night being restricted to the heat shock proteins and proteins involved in metabolism, muscle activity, protein synthesis/folding/degradation and apoptosis, whilst those that were overexpressed in the daytime were apparently involved in metabolism, muscle activity, ion-channel/cellular transport, protein synthesis/folding/degradation, redox homeostasis, development and transcription.

Physiological homology between Drosophila melanogaster and vertebrate cardiovascular systems,21183476,10.1242/dmm.005231,"The physiology of the Drosophila melanogaster cardiovascular system remains poorly characterized compared with its vertebrate counterparts. Basic measures of physiological performance remain unknown. It also is unclear whether subtle physiological defects observed in the human cardiovascular system can be reproduced in D. melanogaster. Here we characterize the cardiovascular physiology of D. melanogaster in its pre-pupal stage by using high-speed dye angiography and optical coherence tomography. The heart has vigorous pulsatile contractions that drive intracardiac, aortic and extracellular-extravascular hemolymph flow. Several physiological measures, including weight-adjusted cardiac output, body-length-adjusted aortic velocities and intracardiac shear forces, are similar to those in the closed vertebrate cardiovascular systems, including that of humans. Extracellular-extravascular flow in the pre-pupal D. melanogaster circulation drives convection-limited fluid transport. To demonstrate homology in heart dysfunction, we showed that, at the pre-pupal stage, a troponin I mutant, held-up2 (hdp2), has impaired systolic and diastolic heart wall velocities. Impaired heart wall velocities occur in the context of a non-dilated phenotype with a mildly depressed fractional shortening. We additionally derive receiver operating characteristic curves showing that heart wall velocity is a potentially powerful discriminator of systolic heart dysfunction.

The one or two amino acid replacements in the C-terminal region between the ADH allozymes of D. melanogaster do not have such clear-cut effects. All four ADH variants show highly negative activation entropies. Sarcosine oxidation by the ADH-71k variant of D. melanogaster has an activation energy barrier similar to that of ethanol oxidation.

We have extended previous observations that hybrid daughters from this cross are poorly viable at high temperatures and have shown that this female lethality is suppressed by Hmr and the rescue mutations In(1)AB and D. simulans Lhr. Deficiencies defined here as Hmr(-) also suppressed lethality, demonstrating that reducing Hmr(+) activity can rescue otherwise inviable hybrids. An Hmr(+) duplication had the opposite effect of reducing the viability of female and sibling X-male hybrid progeny. Similar dose-dependent viability effects of Hmr were observed in the reciprocal cross of D. simulans females to D. melanogaster males. Finally, Lhr and Hmr(+) were shown to have mutually antagonistic effects on hybrid viability. These data suggest a model where the interaction of sibling species Lhr(+) and D. melanogaster Hmr(+) causes lethality in both sexes of species hybrids and in both directions of crossing. Our results further suggest that a twofold difference in Hmr(+) dosage accounts in part for the differential viability of male and female hybrid progeny, but also that additional, unidentified genes must be invoked to account for the invariant lethality of hybrid sons of D. melanogaster mothers.

Since only females produce Z4-11Al, and not males, we can reliably distinguish between single D. melanogaster males and females, according to their scent. Females release Z4-11Al at 2.4 ng/h and we readily sense 1 ng synthetic Z4-11Al in a glass of wine (0.03 nmol/L), while a tenfold concentration is perceived as a loud off-flavour. This corroborates the observation that a glass of wine is spoilt by a single D. melanogaster fly falling into it, which we here show is caused by Z4-11Al.

In both natural populations, temperature is the main determinant of dormancy, alone explaining 67% of the total variation among replicate isofemale lines, whereas photoperiod has no significant effect.

Inhibition of fat-body dissociation is associated with pharate adult lethality and thus is likely to be an essential developmental event. As a start toward understanding the role of fat-body remodeling in the life history of insects, we carried out a detailed study of fat-body disassociation in D. melanogaster using fluorescent microscopy, and tested whether this process is mediated by hemocytes as proposed for fat-body remodeling in Sarcophaga peregrina.

Strains of different geographic origin, with males producing either predominantly 7-T or predominantly 7-P, were hybridized with strains carrying genetic markers. We found that chromosome II changes the balance between 7-T and 7-P while chromosome III regulates the overall quantity of both 7-monoenes. We have also characterized and roughly mapped sept and smoq, two genetic factors on chromosome II that act additively on the production of both cuticular hydrocarbons. The genetic control of the variation in 7-T and 7-P varies between D. melanogaster strains and between D. melanogaster and its sibling species D. simulans. The possible evolutionary and physiological causes of this variation as well as its functional implication for courtship behaviour are discussed.",1996,"J F Ferveur, J M Jallon"
A COMBINED METHOD FOR MAPPING POLYTHENE CHROMOSOMES ON THE EXAMPLE OF THE FOURTH MICROCHROMOSOME OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,30191689,,"Genetic activity of interphase chromosomes is associated with their structural organization, but the mechanism of these relations is still unclear. Classic polythene chromosomes of dipteran insects are a convenient model for such investigations. Despite intensive study of polythene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster is carried out, an exact conformity of bands and interbands to the molecular map of the genome remains unknown in most cases. For addressing this issue, the genetic map and molecular characteristics of chromatin have been compared with the banding pattern of the fourth chromosome, which is the smallest chromosome in the D. melanogaster genome and is different in many ways from other chromosomes. This is a unique chromatin domain of D. melanogaster, which is characterized by specific proteins, including HP1, POF and EGG. Matching of cytological and physical maps of the fourth chromosome has been carried out by FISH. Genomic coordinates of bands and interbands have been determined. This result makes it possible to investigate the regulation of gene activity of the fourth chromosome in the context of molecular characteristics of cytological structures in which these genes are located.",2016,"D S Demidova, S A Demakov, G V Pokholkova, T Yu Zykova, I F Zhimulev"
"Non-ventral lateral neuron-based, non-PDF-mediated clocks control circadian egg-laying rhythm in Drosophila melanogaster",16461981,10.1177/0748730405282882,"The authors report the results of their study aimed at investigating the consequence of targeted ablation of ventral lateral neurons (LN(v)s--neurons regulating eclosion and locomotor activity rhythms) and genetic disruption of pigment-dispersing factor (PDF--an important output of circadian clocks) on the egg-laying rhythm of Drosophila melanogaster. The results clearly suggest that genetic ablation of LN(v)s and loss of function mutation of PDF abolish eclosion and locomotor activity rhythms, whereas the egg-laying rhythm continues unabated. Furthermore, the results also demonstrate that the period of egg-laying rhythm remains unchanged under different ambient temperatures and nutrition levels, suggesting that the egg-laying rhythm of D. melanogaster is temperature and nutrition compensated. Based on these results, the authors conclude that the egg-laying rhythm in D. melanogaster is regulated by non-LN(v)-based, non-PDF-mediated circadian clocks.",2006,"Gitanjali Howlader, Dhanashree A Paranjpe, Vijay Kumar Sharma"
Differences in teratogenic and toxic properties of alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitors pyrazole and 4-methylpyrazole in Drosophila melanogaster: I. ADH allozymes in variable genetic backgrounds,7604387,10.1002/tcm.1770150102,"Pyrazole and 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP) are effective inhibitors of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity in mammals both in vivo and in vitro. 4-MP has a tenfold higher inhibition specificity compared with pyrazole. Pyrazole proved a teratogenic compound in Drosophila melanogaster. Treatment of third instar larvae of D. melanogaster with pyrazole, in contrast with 4-MP, produced an increase in the number of dorsocentral and scutellar macrochaetae and wing-notches in the adult fly. A large difference in the penetrance of terata in males and females was observed. Similar effects were observed in flies lacking ADH molecules. The teratogenicity of pyrazole must be due to disturbance of processes other than ADH inhibition. Synergistic effects were observed between pyrazole and methoxyacetic acid (MAA), an in vitro inhibitor of sarcosine dehydrogenase activity. Each of these compounds, when fed to early third instar larvae, produced terata resembling the Notch mutant of D. melanogaster.",1995,K T Eisses
Hybrid lethal systems in the Drosophila melanogaster species complex,8224857,10.1007/BF02424474,"Lethal phases of the hybrids between Drosophila melanogaster and its sibling species, D. simulans are classified into three types: (1) embryonic lethality in hybrids carrying D. simulans cytoplasm and D. melanogaster X chromosome, (2) larval lethality in hybrids not carrying D. simulans X, and (3) temperature-sensitive pupal lethality in hybrids carrying D. simulans X. The same lethal phases are also observed when either of the two other sibling species, D. mauritiana or D. sechellia, is employed for hybridization with D. melanogaster. Here, we describe genetic analyses of each hybrid lethality, and demonstrate that these three types of lethality are independent phenomena. We then propose two models to interpret the mechanisms of each hybrid lethality. The first model is a modification of the conventional X/autosome imbalance hypothesis assuming a lethal gene and a suppressor gene are involved in the larval lethality, while the second model is for embryonic lethality assuming an interaction between a maternal-effect lethal gene and a suppressor gene.",1993,"K Sawamura, T K Watanabe, M T Yamamoto"
hobo transposable elements in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans,1657707,10.1017/s0016672300029578,"Genomic patterns of occurrence of the transposable element hobo are polymorphic in the sibling species Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. Most tested strains of both species have apparently complete (3.0 kb) and smaller hobo elements (H lines), but in both species some strains completely lack such canonical hobo elements (E lines). The occurrence of H and E lines in D. simulans as well as in D. melanogaster implies that an hypothesis of recent introduction in the latter species is inadequate to explain the phylogenetic occurrence of hobo. Particular internally deleted elements, the approximately 1.5 kb Th1 and Th2 elements, are abundant in many lines of D. melanogaster, and an analogous 1.1 kb internally deleted element, h del sim, is abundant in most lines of D. simulans. Besides the canonical hobo sequences, both species (and their sibling species D. sechellia and D. mauritiana) have many hobo-hybridizing sequences per genome that do not appear to be closely related to the canonical hobo sequence.",1991,"I A Boussy, S B Daniels"

Compensatory ingestion upon dietary restriction in Drosophila melanogaster,16278649,10.1038/nmeth798,"Dietary restriction extends the lifespan of numerous, evolutionarily diverse species. In D. melanogaster, a prominent model for research on the interaction between nutrition and longevity, dietary restriction is typically based on medium dilution, with possible compensatory ingestion commonly being neglected. Possible problems with this approach are revealed by using a method for direct monitoring of D. melanogaster feeding behavior. This demonstrates that dietary restriction elicits robust compensatory changes in food consumption. As a result, the effect of medium dilution is overestimated and, in certain cases, even fully compensated for. Our results strongly indicate that feeding behavior and nutritional composition act concertedly to determine fly lifespan. Feeding behavior thus emerges as a central element in D. melanogaster aging.",2005,"Gil B Carvalho, Pankaj Kapahi, Seymour Benzer"
"Identification and properties of 1,119 candidate lincRNA loci in the Drosophila melanogaster genome",22403033,10.1093/gbe/evs020,"The functional repertoire of long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) molecules has begun to be elucidated in mammals. Determining the biological relevance and potential gene regulatory mechanisms of these enigmatic molecules would be expedited in a more tractable model organism, such as Drosophila melanogaster. To this end, we defined a set of 1,119 putative lincRNA genes in D. melanogaster using modENCODE whole transcriptome (RNA-seq) data. A large majority (1.1 of 1.3 Mb; 85%) of these bases were not previously reported by modENCODE as being transcribed. Significant selective constraint on the sequences of these loci predicts that virtually all have sustained functionality across the Drosophila clade. We observe biases in lincRNA genomic locations and expression profiles that are consistent with some of these lincRNAs being involved in the regulation of neighboring protein-coding genes with developmental functions. We identify lincRNAs that may be important in the developing nervous system and in male-specific organs, such as the testes. LincRNA loci were also identified whose positions, relative to nearby protein-coding loci, are equivalent between D. melanogaster and mouse. This study predicts that the genomes of not only vertebrates, such as mammals, but also an invertebrate (fruit fly) harbor large numbers of lincRNA loci. Our findings now permit exploitation of Drosophila genetics for the investigation of lincRNA mechanisms, including lincRNAs with potential functional analogues in mammals.",2012,"Robert S Young, Ana C Marques, Charlotte Tibbit, Wilfried Haerty, Andrew R Bassett, Ji-Long Liu, Chris P Ponting"
[Retrotransposon gtwin: structural analysis and distribution in Drosophila melanogaster strains],15771247,,"A search for noncanonical variants of the gypsy retrotransposon (MDG4) in the genome of the Drosophila melanogaster strain G32 led to the cloning of four copies of the poorly studied 7411-bp gtwin element. Sequence analysis showed that gtwin belongs to a family of endogeneous retroviruses, which are widespread in the Drosophila genome and have recently been termed insect erantiviruses. The gtwin retrotransposon is evolutionarily closest to MDG4, as evident from a good alignment of their nucleotide sequences including ORF1 (the pol gene) and ORF3 (the env gene), as well as the amino acid sequences of their protein products. These regions showed more than 75% homology. The distribution of gtwin was studied in several strains of the genus Drosophila. While strain G32 contained more than 20 copies of the element, ten other D. melanogaster strains carried gtwin in two to six copies per genome. The gtwin element was not detected in D. hydei or D. virilis. Comparison of the cloned gtwin sequences with the gtwin sequence available from the D. melanogaster genome database showed that the two variants of the mobile element differ by the presence or absence of a stop codon in the central region of ORF3. Its absence from the gtwin copies cloned from the strain G32 may indicate an association between the functional state of ORF3 and amplification of the element.",2005,"A P Kotnova, N N Karpova, M A Feoktistova, N V Liubomirskaia, A I Kim, Iu V Il'in"

The phylogenetic trees showed that D. madeirensis and D. subobscura are the most closely related species in the triad, while D. guanche is the most distantly related one. As in other Drosophila species, Hsp82 is a single copy gene in D. subobscura, D. guanche, and D. madeirensis, while Hsp70 and Hsps, which encode small proteins, are genic families.

In vitro cleavage of Drosophila 2S rRNA by M1 RNA,12903284,10.1093/nass/44.1.93,"Drosophila melanogaster initiator methionine tRNA can adopt an alternative conformation in aqueous solution. In this alternative conformation, the aminoacyl- and the anticodon stems of tRNA are unfolded and then these unfolded regions are used to form extended D- and T-stems, resulting in the formation of two tandemly joined stems and loops. This conformational alternation was recognized then cleaved by the catalytic RNA of Escherichia coli ribonuclease P (M1 RNA). The cleavage occurs within the mature sequence of tRNA. This further processing within mature sequence is called hyperprocessing. During the screening experiments of other conformational changeable D. melanogaster tRNAs by M1 RNA, we incidentally found that M1 RNA also hyperprocessed D. melanogaster 2S rRNA.

A survey of intra- and interspecific variation for pupation height in Drosophila,115457,10.1007/BF01071301,"Pupation heights of various natural and laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. pseudoobscura were observed in the laboratory under conditions of continuous darkness or continuous light. Generally higher mean pupation heights were observed under conditions of darkness. D. melanogaster tended to pupate higher than the D. pseudoobscura populations, and D. pseudoobscura tended to pupate higher than D. simulans. The order of these species differences was similar whether pupation was measured in light or in darkness. Results of selection for pupation height in D. melanogaster suggest the presence of genetic variation for this character. The possibility that a relationship exists between adult and larval behaviors was explored by measuring the pupation heights of larvae from strains selected for geotactic behavior as adults, and also by measuring geotaxis of adults from strains selected for pupation height.",1979,T A Markow

Regulation occurs at the level of individual genes, chromosomal domains, and entire chromosomes. The chromatin state is dynamic, allowing for changes in gene expression in response to cellular signals and/or environmental cues. Changes in chromatin result from the action of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes, reversible epigenetic histone modifications, and the incorporation of histone variants.

Nonetheless, export of heat-shock mRNAs under heat stress was strictly dependent on THO function. Notably, 8% of upregulated genes encode proteins involved in DNA repair.

Pharmacological identification of cholinergic receptor subtypes on Drosophila melanogaster larval heart,26438517,10.1007/s00360-015-0934-4,"The Drosophila melanogaster heart is a popular model in which to study cardiac physiology and development. Progress has been made in understanding the role of endogenous compounds in regulating cardiac function in this model. It is well characterized that common neurotransmitters act on many peripheral and non-neuronal tissues as they flow through the hemolymph of insects. Many of these neuromodulators, including acetylcholine (ACh), have been shown to act directly on the D. melanogaster larval heart. ACh is a primary neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) of vertebrates and at the neuromuscular junctions on skeletal and cardiac tissue. In insects, ACh is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter of sensory neurons and is also prominent in the CNS. A full understanding regarding the regulation of the Drosophila cardiac physiology by the cholinergic system remains poorly understood. Here we use semi-intact D. melanogaster larvae to study the pharmacological profile of cholinergic receptor subtypes, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), in modulating heart rate (HR). Cholinergic receptor agonists, nicotine and muscarine both increase HR, while nAChR agonist clothianidin exhibits no significant effect when exposed to an open preparation at concentrations as low as 100 nM. In addition, both nAChR and mAChR antagonists increase HR as well but also display capabilities of blocking agonist actions.

The water-soluble pristine C60 fullerene at the concentration of 20 μg/ml and 40 μg/ml leads to the activation of the mus209 gene in D. melanogaster larvae salivary glands, which can indicate higher levels of DNA damage. However, the absence of effects at the cell and organismal level could be explained by the activation of repair systems or by active elimination of damaged cells.",2019,"Y Yasinskyi, Protsenko O, Maistrenko O, Rybalchenko V, Yu Prylutskyy, E Tauscher, U Ritter, I Kozeretska"
Effects of artichoke (Cynara scolymus) leaf and bloom head extracts on chemically induced DNA lesions in Drosophila melanogaster,24688296,10.1590/s1415-47572014000100015,"The genotoxicity of bloom head (BHE) and leaf (LE) extracts from artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.), and their ability to modulate the mutagenicity and recombinogenicity of two alkylating agents (ethyl methanesulfonate - EMS and mitomycin C - MMC) and the intercalating agent bleomycin (BLM), were examined using the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster. Neither the mutagenicity nor the recombinogenicity of BLM or MMC was modified by co- or post-treatment with BHE or LE. In contrast, co-treatment with BHE significantly enhanced the EMS-induced genotoxicity involving mutagenic and/or recombinant events. Co-treatment with LE did not alter the genotoxicity of EMS whereas post-treatment with the highest dose of LE significantly increased this genotoxicity. This enhancement included a synergistic increase restricted to somatic recombination.

The evolution of duplicate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes in Drosophila,1468631,,"In Drosophila melanogaster there are two genes which encode the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Gapdh-43E and Gapdh-13F. We have shown that Gapdh-43E codes for the GAPDH subunit with an apparently larger molecular weight while Gapdh-13F encodes the GAPDH subunit having an apparently smaller molecular weight. Immunoblots of sodium dodecyl sulfate gels were used to survey species from throughout the genus and results indicated that two classes of GAPDH subunits are present only in Drosophila species of the melanogaster and takahashi subgroups of the melanogaster group. Only the smaller subunit is found in species of the obscura group while all other species have only a large subunit. Drosophila hydei was analyzed at the DNA level as a representative species of the subgenus Drosophila. The genome of this species has a single Gapdh gene which is localized at a cytogenetic position likely to be homologous to Gapdh-43 E of D. melanogaster. Comparison of its sequence with the sequence of the D. melanogaster Gapdh genes indicates that the two genes of D. melanogaster are more similar to one another than either is to the gene from D. hydei. The Gapdh gene from D. hydei contains an intron following codon 29. Neither Gapdh gene of D. melanogaster has an intron within the coding region. Southern blots of genomic DNA were used to determine which species have duplicate Gapdh genomic sequences. Gene amplification was used to determine which species have a Gapdh gene that is interrupted by an intron. Species of the subgenus Drosophila have a single Gapdh gene with an intron. Species of the willistoni and saltans groups have a single Gapdh gene that does not contain an intron.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1992,"K M Wojtas, L von Kalm, J R Weaver, D T Sullivan"
Oviposition site preferences and performance in natural resources in the human commensals Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans,21540639,10.4161/fly.5.2.15568,"The choice of egg laying site and progeny's performance in a rearing site are important components of habitat selection. Despite the huge amount of genetic, morphological, behavioral and physiological data regarding Drosophila melanogaster Meigen and D. simulans Sturtevant, oviposition site preferences remain poorly known. We investigated resource preference (acceptance and choice) and performance (measured as larval viability, developmental time and wing size) in Vitis vinifera Linneo (grape) and Cydonia oblonga Miller (quince), two fruit plants that D. melanogaster and D. simulans use as breeding substrates in Western Argentina. Females of both species preferred V. vinifera over C. oblonga when offered to lay eggs on grape and/or quince, with D. melanogaster showing a more biased preference for V. vinifera than its sibling. Concerning performance, flies reared in C. oblonga developed faster than in V. vinifera, regardless of the species and D. simulans had a shorter developmental time than D. melanogaster. We also observed inter and intraspecific (between flies reared in different resources) differences in wing size and shape. Our study provides novel data concerning ecological aspects scarcely addressed in these species, and suggest that the use of different resource may be a relevant factor in their recent evolutionary history.",2011,"Eduardo M Soto, Ignacio M Soto, Marcelo D Cortese, Esteban Hasson"
"Comparative gene expression analysis of Dtg, a novel target gene of Dpp signaling pathway in the early Drosophila melanogaster embryo",24321690,10.1016/j.gene.2013.11.032,"In the early Drosophila melanogaster embryo, Dpp, a secreted molecule that belongs to the TGF-β superfamily of growth factors, activates a set of downstream genes to subdivide the dorsal region into amnioserosa and dorsal epidermis. Here, we examined the expression pattern and transcriptional regulation of Dtg, a new target gene of Dpp signaling pathway that is required for proper amnioserosa differentiation. We showed that the expression of Dtg was controlled by Dpp and characterized a 524-bp enhancer that mediated expression in the dorsal midline, as well as, in the differentiated amnioserosa in transgenic reporter embryos. This enhancer contained a highly conserved region of 48-bp in which bioinformatic predictions and in vitro assays identified three Mad binding motifs. Mutational analysis revealed that these three motifs were necessary for proper expression of a reporter gene in transgenic embryos, suggesting that short and highly conserved genomic sequences may be indicative of functional regulatory regions in D. melanogaster genes. Dtg orthologs were not detected in basal lineages of Dipterans, which unlike D. melanogaster develop two extra-embryonic membranes, amnion and serosa, nevertheless Dtg orthologs were identified in the transcriptome of Musca domestica, in which dorsal ectoderm patterning leads to the formation of a single extra-embryonic membrane. These results suggest that Dtg was recruited as a new component of the network that controls dorsal ectoderm patterning in the lineage leading to higher Cyclorrhaphan flies, such as D. melanogaster and M. domestica.",2014,"Christian Hodar, Alejandro Zuñiga, Rodrigo Pulgar, Dante Travisany, Carlos Chacon, Michael Pino, Alejandro Maass, Verónica Cambiazo"

Diverse parts of that sequence were subcloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. It has been demonstrated that the expression of the RT-like sequence, when translated, gives rise to peptides displaying enzyme activity characteristic of a true RT enzyme. In addition, rabbit antisera directed against such recombinant proteins allowed us to detect an immunoreactive protein of around 110 kDa, which was only present in D. melanogaster cell lines, but not in cells derived from Drosophila virilis or Drosophila hydei, whose genomes do not bear the 1731 element.

Patterns of transposable element variation and clinality in Drosophila,30484926,10.1111/mec.14961,"Natural populations often exist in spatially diverse environments and may experience variation in the strength and targets of natural selection across their ranges. Drosophila provides an excellent opportunity to study the effects of spatially varying selection in natural populations, as both Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans live across a wide range of environments in North America. Here, we characterize patterns of variation in transposable elements (TEs) from six populations of D. melanogaster and nine populations of D. simulans sampled from multiple latitudes across North America. We find a nearly twofold excess of TEs in D. melanogaster relative to D. simulans, with this difference largely driven by TEs segregating at the lowest and highest allele frequencies. We find no effect of latitude on either total TE abundance or average TE allele frequencies in either species. Moreover, we show that, as a class of mutations, the most common patterns of TE variation do not coincide with the sampled latitudinal gradient, nor are they consistent with local adaptation acting on environmental differences found in the most extreme latitudes. We also do not find a cline in ancestry for North American D. melanogaster-for either TEs or single nucleotide polymorphisms-suggesting a limited role for demography in shaping patterns of TE variation. Though we find little evidence for widespread clinality among TEs in Drosophila, this does not necessarily imply a limited role for TEs in adaptation. We discuss the need for improved models of adaptation to large-scale environmental heterogeneity, and how these might be applied to TEs.",2019,"Jeffrey R Adrion, David J Begun, Matthew W Hahn"
IPB7 transposase behavior in Drosophila melanogaster and Aedes aegypti,23835045,10.1016/j.ibmb.2013.06.009,"Transposons are used in insect science as genetic tools that enable the transformation of insects and the identification and isolation of genes though their ability to insert in or near to them. Four transposons, piggyBac, Mos1, Hermes and Minos are commonly used in insects beyond Drosophila melanogaster with piggyBac, due to its wide host range and frequency of transposition, being the most commonly chosen. The utility of these transposons as genetic tools is directly proportional to their activity since higher transposition rates would be expected to lead to higher transformation frequencies and higher frequencies of insertion throughout the genome. As a consequence there is an ongoing need for hyperactive transposases for use in insect genetics, however these have proven difficult to obtain. IPB7 is a hyperactive mutant of the piggyBac transposase that was identified by a genetic screen performed in yeast, a mammalian codon optimized version of which was then found to be highly active in rodent embryonic stem cells with no apparent deleterious effects. Here we report the activity of IPB7 in D. melanogaster and the mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Somatic transposition assays revealed an increase in IPB7's transposition rate from wild-type piggyBac transposase in D. melanogaster but not Ae. aegypti. However the use of IPB7 in D. melanogaster genetic transformations produced a high rate of sterility and a low transformation rate compared to wild-type transposase. This high rate of sterility was accompanied by significant gonadal atrophy that was also observed in the absence of the piggyBac vector transposon. We conclude that IPB7 has increased activity in the D. melanogaster germ-line but that a component of the sterility associated with its activity is independent of the presence of the piggyBac transposon.",2013,"Jennifer A Wright, Ryan C Smith, Xianghong Li, Nancy L Craig, Peter W Atkinson"
The organization and evolution of the Responder satellite in species of the Drosophila melanogaster group: dynamic evolution of a target of meiotic drive,25424548,10.1186/s12862-014-0233-9,"Background:
      
    

    
      Satellite DNA can make up a substantial fraction of eukaryotic genomes and has roles in genome structure and chromosome segregation. The rapid evolution of satellite DNA can contribute to genomic instability and genetic incompatibilities between species. Despite its ubiquity and its contribution to genome evolution, we currently know little about the dynamics of satellite DNA evolution. The Responder (Rsp) satellite DNA family is found in the pericentric heterochromatin of chromosome 2 of Drosophila melanogaster. Rsp is well-known for being the target of Segregation Distorter (SD)- an autosomal meiotic drive system in D. melanogaster. I present an evolutionary genetic analysis of the Rsp family of repeats in D. melanogaster and its closely-related species in the melanogaster group (D. simulans, D. sechellia, D. mauritiana, D. erecta, and D. yakuba) using a combination of available BAC sequences, whole genome shotgun Sanger reads, Illumina short read deep sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      I show that Rsp repeats have euchromatic locations throughout the D. melanogaster genome, that Rsp arrays show evidence for concerted evolution, and that Rsp repeats exist outside of D. melanogaster, in the melanogaster group. The repeats in these species are considerably diverged at the sequence level compared to D. melanogaster, and have a strikingly different genomic distribution, even between closely-related sister taxa.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The genomic organization of the Rsp repeat in the D. melanogaster genome is complex-it exists of large blocks of tandem repeats in the heterochromatin and small blocks of tandem repeats in the euchromatin. My discovery of heterochromatic Rsp-like sequences outside of D. melanogaster suggests that SD evolved after its target satellite and that the evolution of the Rsp satellite family is highly dynamic over a short evolutionary time scale (<240,000 years).",2014,Amanda M Larracuente

Dietary Ethanol Mediates Selection on Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Activity in Drosophila melanogaster,21676710,10.1093/icb/44.4.275,"Ethanol is an important environmental variable for fruit-breeding Drosophila species, serving as a resource at low levels and a toxin at high levels. The first step of ethanol metabolism, the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde, is catalyzed primarily by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). The second step, the oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetate, has been a source of controversy, with some authors arguing that it is carried out primarily by ADH itself, rather than a separate aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) as in mammals. We review recent evidence that ALDH plays an important role in ethanol metabolism in Drosophila. In support of this view, we report that D. melanogaster populations maintained on ethanol-supplemented media evolved higher activity of ALDH, as well as of ADH. We have also tentatively identified the structural gene responsible for the majority of ALDH activity in D. melanogaster. We hypothesize that variation in ALDH activity may make an important contribution to the observed wide variation in ethanol tolerance within and among Drosophila species.",2004,"James D Fry, Carolyn M Bahnck, Maryann Mikucki, Nitin Phadnis, Wendy C Slattery"
Experimental Evolution and Heart Function in Drosophila,28277957,10.1086/689288,"Drosophila melanogaster is a good model species for the study of heart function. However, most previous work on D. melanogaster heart function has focused on the effects of large-effect genetic variants. We compare heart function among 18 D. melanogaster populations that have been selected for altered development time, aging, or stress resistance. We find that populations with faster development and faster aging have increased heart dysfunction, measured as percentage heart failure after electrical pacing. Experimental evolution of different triglyceride levels, by contrast, has little effect on heart function. Evolved differences in heart function correlate with allele frequency changes at many loci of small effect.

[P transposable element in Drosophila melanogaster: horizontal transfer],1339594,,"The P transposable element family in Drosophila melanogaster is responsible for the syndrome of hybrid dysgenesis which includes chromosomal rearrangements, male recombination, high mutability and temperature sensitive agametic sterility (called gonadal dysgenesis sterility). P element activity is controlled by a complex regulation system, encoded by the elements themselves, which keeps their transposition rate low within the strain bearing P elements and limits copy number by genome. A second regulatory mechanism, which acts on the level of RNA processing, prevents P mobility to somatic cells. The oldest available strains, representing most major geographical regions of the world, exhibited no detectable hybridization to the P-element. In contrast, all recently collected natural populations that were tested carried P-element sequences. The available evidence is consistent with the hypothesis of a worldwide P-element invasion of D. melanogaster during the past 30 years. Timing and direction of the invasion are discussed. The lack of P-element in older strains of Drosophila melanogaster as well as in the species must closely related to Drosophila melanogaster, suggests that P entered the Drosophila melanogaster genome recently, probably by horizontal transfer from an other species. The analysis of P-element elsewhere in the genus Drosophila reveals that several more distantly related species carried transposable elements with sequences quite similar to P. The species with the best-matching P-element is D. willistoni. A P-element from this species was found to match all but one of the 2907 nucleotides of the Drosophila melanogaster P-element. The phylogenic distributions and the likely horizontal transfers of the two other Drosophila transposable elements are discussed.",1992,D Anxolabehere
Role of Serotonin Transporter in Eye Development of Drosophila melanogaster,32521639,10.3390/ijms21114086,"Serotonin transporter (SerT) in the brain is an important neurotransmitter transporter involved in mental health. However, its role in peripheral organs is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the function of SerT in the development of the compound eye in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that SerT knockdown led to excessive cell death and an increased number of cells in S-phase in the posterior eye imaginal disc. Furthermore, the knockdown of SerT in the eye disc suppressed the activation of Akt, and the introduction of PI3K effectively rescued this phenotype. These results suggested that SerT plays a role in the healthy eye development of D. melanogaster by controlling cell death through the regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.",2020,"Tuan L A Pham, Tran Duy Binh, Guanchen Liu, Thanh Q C Nguyen, Yen D H Nguyen, Ritsuko Sahashi, Tran Thanh Men, Kaeko Kamei"
Conservation of structure and expression of the trithorax gene between Drosophila virilis and Drosophila melanogaster,8555104,10.1016/0925-4773(95)00429-7,"The Drosophila melanogaster trithorax gene encodes several large RNAs which are expressed in complex patterns in the embryo.

It produces a similar to D. melanogaster set of transcripts, and it encodes a protein that shows sequence similarity in several domains which are also conserved in human homologue, ALL-1/HRX. Previous experiments have suggested that a distinct expression domain of trithorax in the posterior region of the embryo is required to maintain expression of the BX-C genes (Sedkov et al., 1994, Development 120, 1907-1917). At cellular blastoderm, trithorax RNA expression in D. virilis embryos is also confined to the posterior portion of the presumptive mesoderm.

Heat shock and ecdysterone activation of the Drosophila melanogaster hsp23 gene; a sequence element implied in developmental regulation,3091364,,"The regulation of the Drosophila melanogaster hsp23 gene by heat shock and ecdysterone has been analysed by measuring activities of hsp--Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase hybrid genes in transfected hormone-sensitive D. melanogaster cells. Mutation analysis identified multiple, distinct promoter elements. A sequence element, which also occurs in the promoters of several other developmentally regulated Drosophila genes, is present in regions of the hsp23 promoter that are essential for its ecdysterone, but not its heat-regulated activity; this element may represent a binding site for an ecdysterone--receptor complex. Mutant promoters that can be activated only by heat shock or by hormone have been constructed. Thus the two types of regulation of the hsp23 gene can function independently of each other.",1986,"R Mestril, P Schiller, J Amin, H Klapper, J Ananthan, R Voellmy"
Hazardous effects of octopamine receptor agonists on altering metabolism-related genes and behavior of Drosophila melanogaster,32283422,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.126629,"Recent reports demonstrate that octopamine receptor (OR) agonists such as formamidine pesticides cause reproductive and developmental toxicity through endocrine disrupting effects in both humans and animals. Herein, we studied the effects of different sublethal concentrations of OR agonists, Amitraz and Chlordimeform, on growth, development, and reproduction of D. melanogaster from a genotype perspective view. As a result, the sublethal concentrations for both OR agonists delayed the developmental time including pupation and eclosion. It significantly reduced the lifespan, eclosion rate, and production of eggs. The mRNA expression of genes relevant for development and metabolism was significantly changed after exposure to sublethal concentrations of both OR agonists. Octopamine receptor in mushroom bodies (Oamb), trehalase enzyme (Treh), hemocyte proliferation (RyR), and immune response (IM4) genes were upregulated whereas, trehalose sugar (Tret1-1), mixed function oxidase enzyme (Cyp9f2), lifespan (Atg7), male mating behavior (Ple), female fertility (Ddc), and lipid metabolism (Sxe2) genes were downregulated. These results support the conclusion that OR agonists activate the octopamine receptor in D. melanogaster leading to an increase of trehalase enzyme activity and degradation of trehalose sugar into free glucose which results in rapid energy exhaustion, hyperexcitation, and disturbing of the octopaminergic system in D. melanogaster.",2020,"Mohamed Ahmed Ibrahim Ahmed, Christoph Franz Adam Vogel"
I element distribution in mitotic heterochromatin of Drosophila melanogaster reactive strains: identification of a specific site which is correlated with the reactivity levels,16093668,10.1159/000084948,"The I factor is a Drosophila melanogaster LINE-like element that efficiently transposes in the genetic system of I-R hybrid dysgenesis.

In this work we have performed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping of I element sequences in mitotic heterochromatin of nine differentially reactive D. melanogaster strains. The results of our analysis showed that a single hybridization site mapping to region h28 of the distal heterochromatin of the X chromosome is present in three strains with low or intermediate levels of reactivity, while it is undetectable in six highly reactive strains. Together, these observations suggest a negative correlation between I sequences located at h28 and the level of reactivity. To this regard, it is intriguing that flamenco and COM, two loci that regulate the activity of D. melanogaster endogenous retroviruses also map to the distal heterochromatin of the X chromosome.

Here we report sex-specific behavioural responses to these infections in D. melanogaster. DCV infection caused increased sleep in female flies, but had no detectable effect in male flies. The presence of Wolbachia did not reduce this behavioural response to viral infection.

Here we performed a microarray study to elucidate the genes, chromosomal loci, molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components that contribute to the α-amanitin resistance phenotype in Drosophila melanogaster. We suggest that toxin entry blockage through the cuticle, phase I and II detoxification, sequestration in lipid particles, and proteolytic cleavage of α-amanitin contribute in concert to this quantitative trait.

The flies were subsequently homogenized and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), catalase and glutathioneߚSߚtransferase (GST) activities, as well as nitric oxide (NO) and total thiol contents were assayed. The phytochemical constituents of GK seed were also determined. It was observed that higher dietary inclusions of GK seed reduced the survival rate of D. melanogaster more significantly compared to control flies. Also, higher dietary inclusions of GK seed significantly reduced locomotor performance and AChE activity, while the ROS level was increased compared to the control. Activities of GST and catalase were significantly increased in flies fed diet supplemented with higher GK seed inclusions but their NO content was significantly reduced compared to control. Phytochemical analysis of GK seed revealed abundance of saponin > glycosides > alkaloids > phenols > flavonoids. These results have shown that dietary inclusion of GK seed at higher concentrations reduced survival rate of D. melanogaster and impaired cholinergic system, with elevated activities of some antioxidant enzymes under acute exposure. These observations could be associated with bioactivities of predominant phytochemicals in GK seed such as saponin and glycosides which have been reportedly toxic at high concentration.

So far, all identified cases of target site resistance to phenylpyrazoles are based on mutations in the Rdl (Resistance to dieldrin) LGCC subunit, the major target site for cyclodiene insecticides. We examined the role that mutations in Rdl have on phenylpyrazole resistance in Drosophila melanogaster, exploring naturally occurring variation, and generating predicted resistance mutations by mutagenesis. Natural variation at the Rdl locus in inbred strains of D. melanogaster included gene duplication, and a line containing two Rdl mutations found in a highly resistant line of Drosophila simulans. These mutations had a moderate impact on survival following exposure to two phenylpyrazoles, fipronil and pyriprole. Homology modelling suggested that the Rdl chloride channel pore contains key residues for binding fipronil and pyriprole. Mutagenesis of these sites and assessment of resistance in vivo in transgenic lines showed that amino acid identity at the Ala(301) site influenced resistance levels, with glycine showing greater survival than serine replacement. We confirm that point mutations at the Rdl 301 site provide moderate resistance to phenylpyrazoles in D. melanogaster. We also emphasize the beneficial aspects of testing predicted mutations in a whole organism to validate a candidate gene approach.",2014,"Emily J Remnant, Craig J Morton, Phillip J Daborn, Christopher Lumb, Ying Ting Yang, Hooi Ling Ng, Michael W Parker, Philip Batterham"
Rapid sequence turnover at an intergenic locus in Drosophila,14739245,10.1093/molbev/msh060,"Closely related species of Drosophila tend to have similar genome sizes. The strong imbalance in favor of small deletions relative to insertions implies that the unconstrained DNA in Drosophila is unlikely to be passively inherited from even closely related ancestors, and yet most DNA in Drosophila genomes is intergenic and potentially unconstrained. In an attempt to investigate the maintenance of this intergenic DNA, we studied the evolution of an intergenic locus on the fourth chromosome of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. This 1.2-kb locus is marked by two distinct, large insertion events: a nuclear transposition of a mitochondrial sequence and a transposition of a nonautonomous DNA transposon DNAREP1_DM. Because we could trace the evolutionary histories of these sequences, we were able to reconstruct the length evolution of this region in some detail. We sequenced this locus in all four species of the D. melanogaster species complex: D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. mauritiana. Although this locus is similar in size in these four species, less than 10% of the sequence from the most recent common ancestor remains in D. melanogaster and all of its sister species. This region appears to have increased in size through several distinct insertions in the ancestor of the D. melanogaster species complex and has been shrinking since the split of these lineages. In addition, we found no evidence suggesting that the size of this locus has been maintained over evolutionary time; these results are consistent with the model of a dynamic equilibrium between persistent DNA loss through small deletions and more sporadic DNA gain through less frequent but longer insertions. The apparent stability of genome size in Drosophila may belie very rapid sequence turnover at intergenic loci.",2004,"Nadia D Singh, Dmitri A Petrov"
A cloned Drosophila DNA fragment which codes for a 4 S RNA species,102349,10.1016/0005-2787(78)90140-5,"A collection of random Drosophila melanogaster DNA fragments cloned individually in Escherichia coli was screened for the presence of sequences complementary to the 4 S, 5 S and 5.8 S RNA species produced in the D. melanogaster Kc tissue culture line. Four D. melanogaster DNA fragments were found which possessed sequences complementary to the 4 S RNA species but not complementary to the 5 S or 5.8 S RNA. One such cloned fragment (6.81 kilobase in length) was characterized further. It hybridizes in situ to region 22A-C of the left arm of chromosome 2 and does not contain repetitive sequences detectable by renaturation (cot) analysis.

Thioester-containing Proteins in the Drosophila melanogaster Immune Response against the Pathogen Photorhabdus,32013030,10.3390/insects11020085,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster forms a magnificent model for interpreting conserved host innate immune signaling and functional processes in response to microbial assaults. In the broad research field of host-microbe interactions, model hosts are used in conjunction with a variety of pathogenic microorganisms to disentangle host immune system activities and microbial pathogenicity strategies. The pathogen Photorhabdus is considered an established model for analyzing bacterial virulence and symbiosis due to its unique life cycle that extends between two invertebrate hosts: an insect and a parasitic nematode. In recent years, particular focus has been given to the mechanistic participation of the D. melanogaster thioester-containing proteins (TEPs) in the overall immune capacity of the fly upon response against the pathogen Photorhabdus alone or in combination with its specific nematode vector Heterorhabditis bacteriophora. The original role of certain TEPs in the insect innate immune machinery was linked to the antibacterial and antiparasite reaction of the mosquito malaria vector Anopheles gambiae; however, revamped interest in the immune competence of these molecules has recently emerged from the D. melanogaster-Photorhabdus infection system. Here, we review the latest findings on this topic with the expectation that such information will refine our understanding of the evolutionary immune role of TEPs in host immune surveillance.",2020,"Ioannis Eleftherianos, Upasana Sachar"
Differential sexual survival of Drosophila melanogaster on copper sulfate,28154959,10.1007/s10709-017-9951-4,"Based on studies of the influence of X-chromosomes on the viability of Drosophila melanogaster exposed to cadmium, and on the role of X-linked genes on copper homeostasis, we examined the effect of copper sulfate (CuSO4) on offspring viability using three independent, inbred D. melanogaster crosses (ensuring identical autosomes for males and females within each cross). Each cross was performed with attached X-chromosome females and males with a single X-chromosome. As female D. melanogaster have less metallothionein RNA expression than males, we predicted fewer female offspring than male offspring in crosses exposed to CuSO4, even though females have two copies of X-chromosome genes, possibly resulting in overdominant heterozygosity. In two of three crosses, CuSO4 caused significantly higher numbers of male offspring compared to female offspring. We hypothesized that these gender-based viability differences to copper exposure are caused by X-chromosome ploidy and X-linked genetic variation affecting metallothionein expression. Observed differential offspring viability responses among crosses to copper exposure also showed that different genetic backgrounds (autosomal and/or X-chromosome) can result in significant differences in heavy metal and metallothionein regulation. These results suggest that the effect of copper on offspring viability depends on both genetic background and gender, as both factors can affect the regulation of metallothionein proteins as well as homeostasis of biologically necessary heavy metals.",2017,"Michael A Balinski, Ronny C Woodruff"
Assessing the genotoxic effects of two lipid peroxidation products (4-oxo-2-nonenal and 4-hydroxy-hexenal) in haemocytes and midgut cells of Drosophila melanogaster larvae,28343031,10.1016/j.fct.2017.03.036,"Lipid peroxidation products can induce tissue damage and are implicated in diverse pathological conditions, including aging, atherosclerosis, brain disorders, cancer, lung and various liver disorders. Since in vivo studies produce relevant information, we have selected Drosophila melanogaster as a suitable in vivo model to characterise the potential risks associated to two lipid peroxidation products namely 4-oxo-2-nonenal (4-ONE) and 4-hydroxy-hexenal (4-HHE). Toxicity, intracellular reactive oxygen species production, and genotoxicity were the end-points evaluated. Haemocytes and midgut cells were the evaluated targets. Results showed that both compounds penetrate the intestine of the larvae, affecting midgut cells, and reaching haemocytes. Significant genotoxic effects, as determined by the comet assay, were observed in both selected cell targets in a concentration/time dependent manner. This study highlights the importance of D. melanogaster as a model organism in the study of the different biological effects caused by lipid peroxidation products entering via ingestion. This is the first study reporting genotoxicity data in haemocytes and midgut cells of D. melanogaster larvae for the two selected compounds.",2017,"Eşref Demir, Ricard Marcos"
Characterization of Reproductive Dormancy in Male Drosophila melanogaster,27932997,10.3389/fphys.2016.00572,"Insects are known to respond to seasonal and adverse environmental changes by entering dormancy, also known as diapause. In some insect species, including Drosophila melanogaster, dormancy occurs in the adult organism and postpones reproduction. This adult dormancy has been studied in female flies where it is characterized by arrested development of ovaries, altered nutrient stores, lowered metabolism, increased stress and immune resistance and drastically extended lifespan. Male dormancy, however, has not been investigated in D. melanogaster, and its physiology is poorly known in most insects. Here we show that unmated 3-6 h old male flies placed at low temperature (11°C) and short photoperiod (10 Light:14 Dark) enter a state of dormancy with arrested spermatogenesis and development of testes and male accessory glands. Over 3 weeks of diapause we see a dynamic increase in stored carbohydrates and an initial increase and then a decrease in lipids. We also note an up-regulated expression of genes involved in metabolism, stress responses and innate immunity. Interestingly, we found that male flies that entered reproductive dormancy do not attempt to mate females kept under non-diapause conditions (25°C, 12L:12D), and conversely non-diapausing males do not mate females in dormancy. In summary, our study shows that male D. melanogaster can enter reproductive dormancy. However, our data suggest that dormant male flies deplete stored nutrients faster than females, studied earlier, and that males take longer to recover reproductive capacity after reintroduction to non-diapause conditions.",2016,"Olga I Kubrak, Lucie Kučerová, Ulrich Theopold, Sören Nylin, Dick R Nässel"
Global Transcriptional Profiling of Diapause and Climatic Adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster,26568616,10.1093/molbev/msv263,"Wild populations of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster experience highly heterogeneous environments over broad geographical ranges as well as over seasonal and annual timescales. Diapause is a primary adaptation to environmental heterogeneity, and in D. melanogaster the propensity to enter diapause varies predictably with latitude and season. Here we performed global transcriptomic profiling of naturally occurring variation in diapause expression elicited by short day photoperiod and moderately low temperature in two tissue types associated with neuroendocrine and endocrine signaling, heads, and ovaries. We show that diapause in D. melanogaster is an actively regulated phenotype at the transcriptional level, suggesting that diapause is not a simple physiological or reproductive quiescence. Differentially expressed genes and pathways are highly distinct in heads and ovaries, demonstrating that the diapause response is not uniform throughout the soma and suggesting that it may be comprised of functional modules associated with specific tissues. Genes downregulated in heads of diapausing flies are significantly enriched for clinally varying single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and seasonally oscillating SNPs, consistent with the hypothesis that diapause is a driving phenotype of climatic adaptation. We also show that chromosome location-based coregulation of gene expression is present in the transcriptional regulation of diapause. Taken together, these results demonstrate that diapause is a complex phenotype actively regulated in multiple tissues, and support the hypothesis that natural variation in diapause propensity underlies adaptation to spatially and temporally varying selective pressures.",2016,"Xiaqing Zhao, Alan O Bergland, Emily L Behrman, Brian D Gregory, Dmitri A Petrov, Paul S Schmidt"
Differences in genome size between closely related species: the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup,16151184,10.1093/molbev/msj012,"Genome size varies considerably among organisms due to differences in the amplification, deletion, and divergence of various kinds of repetitive sequences, including the transposable elements, which constitute a large fraction of the genome. However, while the changes in genome size observed at a wide taxonomic level have been thoroughly investigated, we still know little about the process involved in closely related species. We estimated genome sizes and the reverse transcriptase-related sequence (RTRS) content in the nine species of the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup. We showed that the species differ with regard to their genome size and that the RTRS content is correlated with genome size for all species except Drosophila orena. The genome of D. orena, which is 1.6-fold as big as that of D. melanogaster, has in fact not undergone any major increase in its RTRS content.",2006,"Matthieu Boulesteix, Michèle Weiss, Christian Biémont"

A special attention is paid to the ways of signal transduction and factors involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, and morphological transformation during development of the Malpighian tubules. Evolutionarily conservative genetic systems are considered that are involved in the control of development of both the renal epithelium of Drosophila and mammalian kidneys.

History and structure of sub-Saharan populations of Drosophila melanogaster,16951082,10.1534/genetics.106.058693,"Drosophila melanogaster is an important model organism in evolutionary genetics, yet little is known about the population structure and the demographic history of this species within sub-Saharan Africa, which is thought to contain its ancestral range. We surveyed nucleotide variation at four 1-kb fragments in 240 individual lines representing 21 sub-Saharan and 4 Palearctic population samples of D. melanogaster. In agreement with recent studies, we find a small but significant level of genetic differentiation within sub-Saharan Africa. A clear geographic pattern is observed, with eastern and western African populations composing two genetically distinct groups. This pattern may have resulted from a relatively recent establishment of D. melanogaster in western Africa. Eastern populations show greater evidence for long-term stability, consistent with the hypothesis that eastern Africa contains the ancestral range of the species. Three sub-Saharan populations show evidence for cosmopolitan introgression. Apart from those cases, the closest relationships between Palearctic and sub-Saharan populations involve a sample from the rift zone (Uganda), suggesting that the progenitors of Palearctic D. melanogaster might have come from this region. Finally, we find a large excess of singleton polymorphisms in the full data set, which is best explained by a combination of population growth and purifying selection.",2006,"John E Pool, Charles F Aquadro"
Variable fitness effects of Wolbachia infection in Drosophila melanogaster,15305172,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800514,"Maternally inherited Wolbachia bacteria are extremely widespread among insects and their presence is usually associated with parasitic modifications of host fitness. Wolbachia pipientis infects Drosophila melanogaster populations from all continents, but their persistence in this species occurs despite any strong parasitic effects. Here, we have investigated the symbiosis between Wolbachia and D. melanogaster and found that Wolbachia infection can have significant survival and fecundity effects. Relative to uninfected flies, infected females from three fly strains showed enhanced survival or fecundity associated with Wolbachia infection, one strain showed both and one strain responded positively to Wolbachia removal. We found no difference in egg hatch rates (cytoplasmic incompatibility) for crosses between infected males and uninfected females, although there were fecundity differences. Females from this cross consistently produced fewer eggs than infected females and these fecundity differences could promote the spread of infection just like cytoplasmic incompatibility. More surprising, we found that infected females often had the greatest fecundity when mated to uninfected males. This could also promote the spread of Wolbachia infection, though here the fitness benefits would also help to spread infection when Wolbachia are rare. We suggest that variable fitness effects, in both sexes, and which interact strongly with the genetic background of the host, could increase cytoplasmic drive rates in some genotypes and help explain the widespread persistence of Wolbachia bacteria in D. melanogaster populations. These interactions may further explain why many D. melanogaster populations are polymorphic for Wolbachia infection. We discuss our results in the context of host-symbiont co-evolution.",2004,"A J Fry, M R Palmer, D M Rand"
"Rhizoxin analogs, orfamide A and chitinase production contribute to the toxicity of Pseudomonas protegens strain Pf-5 to Drosophila melanogaster",27130686,10.1111/1462-2920.13369,"Pseudomonas protegens strain Pf-5 is a soil bacterium that was first described for its capacity to suppress plant diseases and has since been shown to be lethal to certain insects. Among these is the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a well-established model organism for studies evaluating the molecular and cellular basis of the immune response to bacterial challenge. Pf-5 produces the insect toxin FitD, but a ΔfitD mutant of Pf-5 retained full toxicity against D. melanogaster in a noninvasive feeding assay, indicating that FitD is not a major determinant of Pf-5's oral toxicity against this insect. Pf-5 also produces a broad spectrum of exoenzymes and natural products with antibiotic activity, whereas a mutant with a deletion in the global regulatory gene gacA produces none of these exoproducts and also lacks toxicity to D. melanogaster. In this study, we made use of a panel of Pf-5 mutants having single or multiple mutations in the biosynthetic gene clusters for seven natural products and two exoenzymes that are produced by the bacterium under the control of gacA. Our results demonstrate that the production of rhizoxin analogs, orfamide A, and chitinase are required for full oral toxicity of Pf-5 against D. melanogaster, with rhizoxins being the primary determinant.",2016,"Joyce E Loper, Marcella D Henkels, Lorena I Rangel, Marika H Olcott, Francesca L Walker, Kise L Bond, Teresa A Kidarsa, Cedar N Hesse, Baruch Sneh, Virginia O Stockwell, Barbara J Taylor"
DNA variability and divergence at the notch locus in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans: a case of accelerated synonymous site divergence,15166145,10.1534/genetics.167.1.171,"DNA diversity in two segments of the Notch locus was surveyed in four populations of Drosophila melanogaster and two of D. simulans. In both species we observed evidence of non-steady-state evolution. In D. simulans we observed a significant excess of intermediate frequency variants in a non-African population. In D. melanogaster we observed a disparity between levels of sequence polymorphism and divergence between one of the Notch regions sequenced and other neutral X chromosome loci. The striking feature of the data is the high level of synonymous site divergence at Notch, which is the highest reported to date. To more thoroughly investigate the pattern of synonymous site evolution between these species, we developed a method for calibrating preferred, unpreferred, and equal synonymous substitutions by the effective (potential) number of such changes. In D. simulans, we find that preferred changes per ""site"" are evolving significantly faster than unpreferred changes at Notch. In contrast we observe a significantly faster per site substitution rate of unpreferred changes in D. melanogaster at this locus. These results suggest that positive selection, and not simply relaxation of constraint on codon bias, has contributed to the higher levels of unpreferred divergence along the D. melanogaster lineage at Notch.",2004,"Vanessa Bauer DuMont, Justin C Fay, Peter P Calabrese, Charles F Aquadro"
How two Afrotropical endemics made two cosmopolitan human commensals: the Drosophila melanogaster-D. simulans palaeogeographic riddle,15088644,10.1023/b:gene.0000017627.27537.ef,"Despite countless biogeographic, ecological and molecular data, the origin, age and palaeogeographic trajectory of Drosophila melanogaster or D. simulans have remained highly debatable. Even the most widely accepted views, like the place and antiquity of the wild-to-domestic behavior shift in D. melanogaster, and which of the two species arose first appear questionable. Here, we present a critical review of the conflicting hypotheses, and make testable suggestions. Although both species are cosmopolitan human commensals, they have a contrasted biogeography, ecology and history. The disappearance of the wild behavior in some or all D. melanogaster populations may date back to the 18,000 years BP post-Aterian hyperarid phase. Alternatively, D. melanogaster populations where the wild behavior would still prevail may still exist in Central Africa. The 600-fold reduction in surface that affected the Seychelles Bank 10,000 years ago, undoubtedly affected D. simulans and D. sechellia population sizes dramatically. We stress the good match between the geographical ranges of D. simulans and Morinda citrifolia, and the mismatch between D. sechellia and this rubiaceous plant, yet assumed to be its restricted host-plant. We suggest that the ecological status of the four species of the melanogaster complex may represent four steps of the same process indicating a gradual shift from specialization and local confinement to opportunism and human commensalisms.",2004,"Daniel Lachaise, Jean-François Silvain"
A DNA segment controlling metal-regulated expression of the Drosophila melanogaster metallothionein gene Mtn,3110597,10.1128/mcb.7.5.1710,"Cloned fragments of DNA including the Drosophila melanogaster metallothionein gene Mtn and different amounts of 5' flanking sequences were introduced into flies by P-element-mediated germ line transformation. Comparison of RNA levels in different transformants revealed that metal-regulated and tissue-specific expression of Mtn requires no more than 373 base pairs upstream of the initiation site of transcription. Transformants having an additional, transcribed copy of Mtn could tolerate increased concentrations of cadmium, indicating that Mtn expression is directly related to this phenotype. In separate experiments, these D. melanogaster promoter sequences were fused to the coding sequences of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) gene. After transfection of this fusion into baby hamster kidney cells, increases in TK activity and accumulation of TK RNA were inducible by metals. A series of 5' and 3' deletions showed that D. melanogaster sequences from -130 to -6 were sufficient to confer metal-regulated expression to the TK gene.

Then it was demonstrated to have a function in RNA splicing and dosage compensation in Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, we discovered a new function of Zn72D in male fertility. We showed that knockdown of Zn72D in fly testes caused an extremely low egg hatch rate. Immunofluorescence staining of Zn72D knockdown testes exhibited scattered spermatid nuclei and no actin cones or individualization complexes (ICs) during spermiogenesis, whereas the early-stage germ cells and the spermatocytes were observed clearly. There were no mature sperms in the seminal vesicles of Zn72D knockdown fly testes, although a few sperms could be found close to the seminal vesicle. We further showed that many cytoskeleton-related genes were significantly downregulated in fly testes due to Zn72D knockdown.

Our results show that some wild-type flies are virtually sleepless in baseline conditions and that complete, forced sleep restriction is not necessarily a lethal treatment in wild-type D. melanogaster. We also show that circadian drive, and not homeostatic regulation, is the main contributor to sleep pressure in flies.

We find that while sexual dimorphism for locomotion has been reversed in D. simulans, there has been no evolution of social effects between these two species. What did evolve was the interaction between genotype-specific Ψ and the environment, as D. melanogaster varies unpredictably between environments and D. simulans does not.

Aneuploidy in Drosophila.

Qualitatively similar results were observed with D. melanogaster and mouse brain microtubules. The in vitro results from D. melanogaster correlate well with previously published results from in vivo assays monitoring induced sex chromosome aneuploidy in that effective aneuploidogens are observed to affect microtubule assembly. The inclusion of taxol does not appear to qualitatively affect the assembly assays with the chemicals tested. In contrast with results from assembly assays, the tested aneuploidogens, including colchicine, do not promote disassembly to taxol-purified microtubules. It is possible that taxol has shifted the equilibrium and stabilized the formed microtubules to the extent that they are no longer sensitive to aneuploidogen-induced disassembly.",1990,"A Sehgal, C Osgood, S Zimmering"

The Drosophila melanogaster Gut Microbiota Provisions Thiamine to Its Host,29511074,10.1128/mBio.00155-18,"The microbiota of Drosophila melanogaster has a substantial impact on host physiology and nutrition. Some effects may involve vitamin provisioning, but the relationships between microbe-derived vitamins, diet, and host health remain to be established systematically. We explored the contribution of microbiota in supplying sufficient dietary thiamine (vitamin B1) to support D. melanogaster at different stages of its life cycle. Using chemically defined diets with different levels of available thiamine, we found that the interaction of thiamine concentration and microbiota did not affect the longevity of adult D. melanogaster Likewise, this interplay did not have an impact on egg production. However, we determined that thiamine availability has a large impact on offspring development, as axenic offspring were unable to develop on a thiamine-free diet. Offspring survived on the diet only when the microbiota was present or added back, demonstrating that the microbiota was able to provide enough thiamine to support host development. Through gnotobiotic studies, we determined that Acetobacter pomorum, a common member of the microbiota, was able to rescue development of larvae raised on the no-thiamine diet. Further, it was the only microbiota member that produced measurable amounts of thiamine when grown on the thiamine-free fly medium. Its close relative Acetobacter pasteurianus also rescued larvae; however, a thiamine auxotrophic mutant strain was unable to support larval growth and development. The results demonstrate that the D. melanogaster microbiota functions to provision thiamine to its host in a low-thiamine environment.IMPORTANCE There has been a long-standing assumption that the microbiota of animals provides their hosts with essential B vitamins; however, there is not a wealth of empirical evidence supporting this idea, especially for vitamin B1 (thiamine). To determine whether this assumption is true, we used Drosophila melanogaster and chemically defined diets with different thiamine concentrations as a model. We found that the microbiota does provide thiamine to its host, enough to allow the development of flies on a thiamine-free diet. The power of the Drosophila-microbiota system allowed us to determine that one microbiota member in particular, Acetobacter pomorum, is responsible for the thiamine provisioning. Thereby, our study verifies this long-standing hypothesis. Finally, the methods used in this work are applicable for interrogating the underpinnings of other aspects of the tripartite interaction between diet, host, and microbiota.",2018,"David R Sannino, Adam J Dobson, Katie Edwards, Esther R Angert, Nicolas Buchon"
A comparison of Hsp70 expression and thermotolerance in adults and larvae of three Drosophila species,10590838,10.1379/1466-1268(1999)004<0243:acohea>2.3.co;2,"Heat shock proteins (Hsps) and other molecular chaperones perform diverse physiological roles. One is to facilitate, in part, organismal thermotolerance, of which the functional consequences depend on Hsp70 concentration and developmental stage in Drosophila melanogaster. To test whether an Hsp70-thermotolerance relationship is a general phenomenon within Drosophila, I assayed Hsp70 concentration at a range of temperatures in intact larvae and adults of three species, D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. mojavensis, and compared those results to the increase in survival to heat shock that occurs after an Hsp70 inducing pretreatment. Larvae of D. melanogaster and D. simulans responded similarly to heat; they expressed Hsp70 maximally at 36-37 degrees C, and their tolerance of 1 h heat shocks increased by 1.5-2 degrees C. By contrast, D. mojavensis, which tolerates higher temperatures than do D. melanogaster and D. simulans, expressed Hsp70 only at higher temperatures, although the 36 degrees C pretreatment still increased thermotolerance. Critically, the temperature that maximally induced Hsp70 was a poor inducer of thermotolerance in D. mojavensis and may have harmed larvae. Results for Drosophila adults, which tolerated heat poorly compared to larvae, likewise suggest that a close link between peak Hsp70 expression and maximal induction of thermotolerance is a feature of D. melanogaster, and not of the other species. Neither D. simulans nor D. mojavensis adults increased tolerance after exposure to the temperatures that maximally induced Hsp70.",1999,R A Krebs
Identical satellite DNA sequences in sibling species of Drosophila,3112413,10.1016/0022-2836(87)90365-2,"The evolution of simple satellite DNAs was examined by DNA-DNA hybridization of ten Drosophila melanogaster satellite sequences to DNAs of the sibling species, Drosophila simulans and Drosophila erecta. Seven of these repeat types are present in tandem arrays in D. simulans and each of the ten sequences is repeated in D. erecta. In thermal melts, six of the seven satellite sequences in D. simulans and seven of the ten sequences in D. erecta melted within 1 deg.C of the corresponding values in D. melanogaster. The remaining sequences melted within 3 deg.C of the homologous hybrids. Therefore, there is little or no alteration in those satellite sequences held in common, despite a period of about ten million years since the divergence of D. melanogaster and D. simulans from a common ancestor. Simple satellite sequences appear to be more highly conserved than coding regions of the genome, on a per nucleotide basis. Since multiple copies of three satellite sequences could not be detected in D. simulans yet are present in D. erecta, a species more distantly related to D. melanogaster than is D. simulans, these sequences show discontinuities in evolution. There were major quantitative variations between species, showing that satellite DNAs are prone to massive amplification or diminution events over timespans as short as those separating sibling species. In D. melanogaster, these sequences amount to 21% of the genome but only 5% in D. simulans and 0.4% in D. erecta. There was a general trend of lower abundance with evolutionary distance for most satellites, suggesting that the amounts of different satellite sequences do not vary independently during evolution.",1987,"A R Lohe, D L Brutlag"
Origin and evolution of a new retained intron on the vulcan gene in Drosophila melanogaster subgroup species,25723758,10.1139/gen-2014-0132,"Although numerous intron gains have been discovered, the mechanisms of intron creation have proven to be elusive. Previous study revealed that the vulcan gene of Drosophila melanogaster contained four exons in its coding region. In the current study, a newly created intron (Intron L) was identified on exon 2 of vulcan in D. melanogaster by comparing expression sequence tags. The RT-PCR experiment revealed that Intron L was associated with intron retention, in which two alternative transcripts of the gene differ by the inclusion or removal of an intron. It was found that Intron L was created by intronization of exonic sequence, and its donor and acceptor splice sites were created by synonymous mutation, leading to the origin of a new vulcan protein that is 22 amino acids shorter than the previously reported vulcan protein. Moreover, to track the origin of Intron L, 36 orthologous genes of species of Drosophila were cloned or annotated, and phylogenetic analysis was carried out. It indicated that the common ancestor of D. melangaster subgroup species created Intron L about 15 million years ago.",2014,"Leilei Zhan, Qiaohong Meng, Ran Chen, Yuan Yue, Yongfeng Jin"
[Selection and some properties of recombinant clones of lambda bacteriophage containing structural genes of Drosophila melanogaster],111033,,"The lambdagt clones containing fragments of D. melanogaster genome were prepared and characterized by hybridization of their DNA with complementary RNA synthesized on the lambdagt DNA, C fragment of lambdagt DNA and total D. melanogaster DNA, and also with mRNA and a stable cytoplasmic poly(A)-RNA both isolated from D. melanogaster cells grown in culture. The technique for a simple selection of hybrid clones is described. The hybridization with mRNA allows one to select the clones containing structural genes of D. melanogaster. It was found that in all cases when the clone contains the structural gene it also contains the reiterated base sequences of the D. melanogaster genome. Several clones containing D. melanogaster DNA fragments with a size of (2--4) X 10(6) daltons which hybridized with a relatively large portion of mRNA were selcted for further analysis.",1977,"Iu V Il'in, N A Churikov, A S Solonin, L G Polukarova, G P Georgiev"
Middle repetitive DNA: a fluid component of the Drosophila genome,118464,10.1073/pnas.76.12.6274,"Most of the middle repetitive DNA of Drosophila melanogaster appears to be organized into families of 10-100 repeated elements that are found at scattered locations in the chromosome arms and occupy new chromosomal positions as populations of D. melanogaster diverge. These ""nomadic"" DNA segments can be identified by an analysis of cDm plasmids, hybrids of ColE1 and segments of randomly sheared D. melanogaster DNA. Eighty cDm plasmids were withdrawn, at random, from a library of approximately 17,000 cDm clones. Fifty-seven of these seem to contain either DNA that is not repeated in the D. melanogaster genome or DNA that has a low repetition frequency. The remaining 23 cDm plasmids contain repetitive sequences. Seventeen of these 23 plasmids contain repetitive sequences that are demonstrably scattered to many chromosomal sites that can be mapped in two D. melanogaster strains, g-1 and g-X11. The repeated elements hybridizing with each of the different Dm segments are at quite different chromosomal locations in these two strains. However, the size of each family of repeated sequences remains fairly constant in both strains. It is proposed that the number of elements in each family has been fixed by selection.",1979,M W Young
Influence of Quercetin in the Temporal Regulation of Redox Homeostasis in Drosophila melanogaster,28931163,10.1093/jisesa/iex040,"Numerous biological processes are governed by the biological clock. Studies using Drosophila melanogaster (L.) are valuable that could be of importance for their effective applications on rodent studies. In this study, the beneficial role of quercetin (a flavonoid) on H2O2 induced stress in D. melanogaster was investigated. D. melanogaster flies were divided into four groups (group I - control, group II - H2O2 (acute exposure), group III - quercetin, and group IV - quercetin + H2O2 treated). Negative geotaxis assay, oxidative stress indicators (protein carbonyls, thiobarbituric reactive substances [TBARS]), and antioxidants (superoxide dismutase [SOD], catalase [CAT], glutathione-S-transferase [GST], glutathione peroxidase, and reduced glutathione [GSH]) were measured at 4 h intervals over 24 h and temporal expression of heat shock protein-70 (Hsp70), Upd1 (homolog of IL-6 in Drosophila), and nitric oxide synthase (Nos) was analyzed by Western blotting. Groups II and IV showed altered biochemical rhythms (compared with controls). Decreased mesor values of negative geotaxis, SOD, CAT, GST, and GSH were noticed in H2O2, increased mesor of oxidative stress indicators (TBARS and protein carbonyl content) and a reversibility of the rhythmic characteristics were conspicuous after quercetin treatment. The expression levels of Hsp70, Upd1, and Nos were noticeably maximum at 04:00. Significant elevation of expression by H2O2 was nearly normalized by quercetin treatment. The possible mechanism by which quercetin modulates oxidant-antioxidant imbalance under oxidative stress could be ascribed to the modulation of the rhythmic properties. Our results will be helpful to understand the molecular interlink between circadian rhythm and oxidative stress mechanism.",2017,"Perumal Subramanian, Kanimozhi Kaliyamoorthy, Jaime Jacqueline Jayapalan, Puteri Shafinaz Abdul-Rahman, Onn Haji Hashim"
[The role of white gene and its mechanism during the formation of curly wing in Drosophila melanogaster],29692083,10.13287/j.1001-9332.201802.032,"Curly wing is one of the most frequently used genetic markers in Drosophila melanogaster, but its molecular mechanism is remained unclear. Previous results have showed that physicochemical stimulation would affect the formation of the cruly wing. Our recent study found that H2O2 could not only affect the eclosion rate of D. melanogaster, but also induce the formation of curly wing. Here, we aimed to uncover the specific factors influencing the formation of curly wing in D. melanogaster via changing the concentration of H2O2 and the temperature as well as the time of H2O2 treatment. We measured the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), in order to examine the effects of H2O2 on antioxidative capacity of D. melanogaster. The results showed that the eclosion rate of D. melanogaster was inversely correlated with the concentration of H2O2. The change of temperature, H2O2 concentration and the period of H2O2 treatment affected the degree of the curl and the proportion of the curly wing. The white mutant flies responded most significantly to these three conditions, the mini-white (white gene reverse mutation) flies could rescue the curly phenotype, and responded similarly to the wild type OR. H2O2 had effects on the formation of the curly wing which contained the Cy mutation, leading to increased rate of the curly wing. D. melanogaster treated with H2O2 would reduce the antioxidative capacity. Results from real-time quantitative PCR showed that H2O2 treatment resulted in a change in gene expression. The formation of curly wing was a complicated process, and H2O2 might act as a signaling molecule or indirectly affect certain factors in the formation of curly wing in D. melano-gaster. This process might share the same signaling pathway with the Cy mutant, or might be regulated by different modulating patterns.",2018,"Cheng Li Wu, Xin da Lin, Yan Yun Jiang, Shuai Shuai Meng"
Molecular population genetics of the distal portion of the X chromosome in Drosophila: evidence for genetic hitchhiking of the yellow-achaete region,1664405,,"We have estimated DNA sequence variation and differentiation within and between Drosophila melanogaster and its sibling species, Drosophila simulans, using six-cutter restriction site variation at yellow-achaete (y-ac), phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Pgd), and period (per). These three gene regions are of varying distance from the telomere of the X chromosome and range from very low to moderate rates of recombination in D. melanogaster. According to Tajima's test of neutrality, the Pgd region has been influenced by balancing selection in D. melanogaster. This is consistent with previous data suggesting the allozyme polymorphism at this locus is visible to selection. The Hudson, Kreitman, Aguadé test of neutrality reveals a significant departure from neutrality for the y-ac region compared to the per or rosy regions in D. simulans. There is also a significant departure for the y-ac region compared to the Adh 5' flanking region in D. melanogaster. In both species the departure appears to be due to reduced variation at y-ac compared to that expected from divergence between D. simulans and D. melanogaster. We conclude that recent hitchhiking associated with the selective fixation of one or more advantageous mutants in the y-ac region is the best explanation for reduced variation at y-ac.",1991,"D J Begun, C F Aquadro"
Comparative studies of allozyme loci in Drosophila simulans and Drosophila melanogaster. I. Three dipeptidase loci,6784720,10.1007/BF00486138,"Genetic variation at three dipeptidase loci (Dip-A, Dip-B, and Dip-C) in Drosophila simulans was analyzed by starch gel electrophoresis. Dip-A was found to be polymorphic in four populations, while Dip-B and Dip-C were found to be polymorphic in one. The numbers of different alleles found at each respective locus were: Dip-A, two; Dip-B, two; and Dip-C, three. Dip-A was genetically mapped at 57.9 on the second chromosome, and Dip-B and Dip-C at 80.9 and 87.9 on the third chromosome, respectively. Neither Dip-B nor Dip-C has been mapped in D. melanogaster because both loci are apparently monomorphic. Their map positions in D. simulans with respect to flanking markers whose homologous genes have been cytogenetically localized in D. melanogaster suggested that they might be mapped cytogenetically by using available deficiencies in D. melanogaster. Accordingly, by the construction of interspecific hybrids which carried deficiencies of melanogaster and an allele of simulans with a mobility different from that of the fixed melanogaster allele, Dip-B and Dip-C were localized between 87 F12-14 and 88 C1-3 and between 87 B5-6 and 87 B8-10, respectively, in the salivary gland chromosomes of D. melanogaster.

Surprising differences in the variability of Y chromosomes in African and cosmopolitan populations of Drosophila melanogaster,23086221,10.1534/genetics.112.146167,"The nonrecombining Drosophila melanogaster Y chromosome is heterochromatic and has few genes. Despite these limitations, there remains ample opportunity for natural selection to act on the genes that are vital for male fertility and on Y factors that modulate gene expression elsewhere in the genome. Y chromosomes of many organisms have low levels of nucleotide variability, but a formal survey of D. melanogaster Y chromosome variation had yet to be performed. Here we surveyed Y-linked variation in six populations of D. melanogaster spread across the globe. We find surprisingly low levels of variability in African relative to Cosmopolitan (i.e., non-African) populations. While the low levels of Cosmopolitan Y chromosome polymorphism can be explained by the demographic histories of these populations, the staggeringly low polymorphism of African Y chromosomes cannot be explained by demographic history. An explanation that is entirely consistent with the data is that the Y chromosomes of Zimbabwe and Uganda populations have experienced recent selective sweeps. Interestingly, the Zimbabwe and Uganda Y chromosomes differ: in Zimbabwe, a European Y chromosome appears to have swept through the population.",2013,"Amanda M Larracuente, Andrew G Clark"
Approximate Bayesian analysis of Drosophila melanogaster polymorphism data reveals a recent colonization of Southeast Asia,21300986,10.1093/molbev/msr031,"Southeast Asian populations of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster differ from ancestral African and derived European populations by several morphological characteristics. It has been argued that this morphological differentiation could be the result of an early colonization of Southeast Asia that predated the migration of D. melanogaster to Europe after the last glacial period (around 10,000 years ago). To investigate the colonization process of Southeast Asia, we collected nucleotide polymorphism data for more than 200 X-linked fragments and 50 autosomal loci from a population of Malaysia. We analyzed this new single nucleotide polymorphism data set jointly with already existing data from an African and a European population by employing an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach. By contrasting different demographic models of these three populations, we do not find any evidence for an early divergence between the African and the Asian populations. Rather, we show that Asian and European populations of D. melanogaster share a non-African most recent common ancestor that existed about 2,500 years ago.",2011,"Stefan J Y Laurent, Annegret Werzner, Laurent Excoffier, Wolfgang Stephan"
Nonneutral admixture of immigrant genotypes in African Drosophila melanogaster populations from Zimbabwe,12777509,10.1093/molbev/msg148,"Drosophila melanogaster originated in Africa and colonized the rest of the world only recently (approximately 10,000 to 15,000 years ago). Using 151 microsatellite loci, we investigated patterns of gene flow between African D. melanogaster populations representing presumptive ancestral variation and recently colonized European populations. Although we detected almost no evidence for alleles of non-African ancestry in a rural D. melanogaster population from Zimbabwe, an urban population from Zimbabwe showed evidence for admixture. Interestingly, the degree of admixture differed among chromosomes. X chromosomes of both rural and urban populations showed almost no non-African ancestry, but the third chromosome in the urban population showed up to 70% of non-African alleles. When chromosomes were broken into contingent microsatellite blocks, even higher estimates of admixture and significant heterogeneity in admixture was observed among these blocks. The discrepancy between the X chromosome and the third chromosome is not consistent with a neutral admixture hypothesis. The higher number of European alleles on the third chromosome could be due to stronger selection against foreign alleles on the X chromosome or to more introgression of (beneficial) alleles on the third chromosome.",2003,"Maximilian Kauer, Daniel Dieringer, Christian Schlötterer"

After incubation with JH III bisepoxide, all cell fractions and cEH produced epoxy-diol, cis- and trans-tetrahydrofuran-diols, and tetraol as metabolites. An increase in the concentration of cEH resulted in an increase in the proportion of tetraol as a JH III bisepoxide metabolite but this trend was not observed in the D. melanogaster cell fractions.

Comparative analysis of transposable elements in the melanogaster subgroup sequenced genomes,21156200,10.1016/j.gene.2010.11.009,"Transposable elements (TEs) are indwelling components of genomes, and their dynamics have been a driving force in genome evolution. Although we now have more information concerning their amounts and characteristics in various organisms, we still have little data from overall comparisons of their sequences in very closely-related species. While the Drosophila melanogaster genome has been extensively studied, we have only limited knowledge regarding the precise TE sequences in the genomes of the related species Drosophila simulans, Drosophila sechellia and Drosophila yakuba. In this study we analyzed the number and structure of TE copies in the sequenced genomes of these four species. Our findings show that, unexpectedly, the number of TE insertions in D. simulans is greater than that in D. melanogaster, but that most of the copies in D. simulans are degraded and in small fragments, as in D. sechellia and D. yakuba. This suggests that all three species were invaded by numerous TEs a long time ago, but have since regulated their activity, as the present TE copies are degraded, with very few full-length elements. In contrast, in D. melanogaster, a recent activation of TEs has resulted in a large number of almost-identical TE copies. We have detected variants of some TEs in D. simulans and D. sechellia, that are almost identical to the reference TE sequences in D. melanogaster, suggesting that D. melanogaster has recently been invaded by active TE variants from the other species. Our results indicate that the three species D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. yakuba seem to be at a different stage of their TE life cycle when compared to D. melanogaster. Moreover, we show that D. melanogaster has been invaded by active TE variants for several TE families likely to come from D. simulans or the ancestor of D. simulans and D. sechellia.

Impaired climbing and flight behaviour in Drosophila melanogaster following carbon dioxide anaesthesia,26477397,10.1038/srep15298,"Laboratories that study Drosophila melanogaster or other insects commonly use carbon dioxide (CO2) anaesthesia for sorting or other work. Unfortunately, the use of CO2 has potential unwanted physiological effects, including altered respiratory and muscle physiology, which impact motor function behaviours. The effects of CO2 at different levels and exposure times were examined on the subsequent recovery of motor function as assessed by climbing and flight assays. With as little as a five minute exposure to 100% CO2, D. melanogaster exhibited climbing deficits up to 24 hours after exposure. Any exposure length over five minutes produced climbing deficits that lasted for days. Flight behaviour was also impaired following CO2 exposure. Overall, there was a positive correlation between CO2 exposure length and recovery time for both behaviours. Furthermore, exposure to as little as 65% CO2 affected the motor capability of D. melanogaster. These negative effects are due to both a CO2-specific mechanism and an anoxic effect. These results indicate a heretofore unconsidered impact of CO2 anaesthesia on subsequent behavioural tests revealing the importance of monitoring and accounting for CO2 exposure when performing physiological or behavioural studies in insects.",2015,"Nathan R Bartholomew, Jacob M Burdett, John M VandenBrooks, Michael C Quinlan, Gerald B Call"

The Hybrid Incompatibility Genes Lhr and Hmr Are Required for Sister Chromatid Detachment During Anaphase but Not for Centromere Function,29046402,10.1534/genetics.117.300390,"Crosses between Drosophila melanogaster females and Drosophila simulans males produce hybrid sons that die at the larval stage. This hybrid lethality is suppressed by loss-of-function mutations in the D. melanogaster Hybrid male rescue (Hmr) or in the D. simulans Lethal hybrid rescue (Lhr) genes. Previous studies have shown that Hmr and Lhr interact with heterochromatin proteins and suppress expression of transposable elements within D. melanogaster It also has been proposed that Hmr and Lhr function at the centromere. We examined mitotic divisions in larval brains from Hmr and Lhr single mutants and Hmr; Lhr double mutants in D. melanogaster In none of the mutants did we observe defects in metaphase chromosome alignment or hyperploid cells, which are hallmarks of centromere or kinetochore dysfunction. In addition, we found that Hmr-HA and Lhr-HA do not colocalize with centromeres either during interphase or mitotic division. However, all mutants displayed anaphase bridges and chromosome aberrations resulting from the breakage of these bridges, predominantly at the euchromatin-heterochromatin junction. The few dividing cells present in hybrid males showed fuzzy and irregularly condensed chromosomes with unresolved sister chromatids. Despite this defect in condensation, chromosomes in hybrids managed to align on the metaphase plate and undergo anaphase. We conclude that there is no evidence for a centromeric function of Hmr and Lhr within D. melanogaster nor for a centromere defect causing hybrid lethality. Instead, we find that Hmr and Lhr are required in D. melanogaster for detachment of sister chromatids during anaphase.",2017,"Jacob A Blum, Silvia Bonaccorsi, Marta Marzullo, Valeria Palumbo, Yukiko M Yamashita, Daniel A Barbash, Maurizio Gatti"
Analysis of Drosophila chromosome 4 using pulsed field gel electrophoresis,8149812,10.1007/BF00650898,"Previous estimates of the size of Drosophila melanogaster chromosome 4 have indicated that it is 1% to 4% of the genome or approximately 6 Mb. We have used pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to separate megabase-sized molecules of D. melanogaster chromosomal DNA. Southern blots of these gels were probed with DNA fragments from the cubitus interruptus and zfh-2 genes, which are located on chromosome 4. They each identify the same-sized distinct band that migrates at approximately 5.2 Mb in DNA preparations from the Kc cell line. We interpret this band to be intact chromosome 4. In DNA obtained from embryos of various D. melanogaster wild-type strains, this chromosome band showed strain-specific size variation that ranged from 4.5 to 5.2 Mb. The D. melanogaster chromosome 4 probes also identified a single, 2.4 Mb band in embryonic DNA from Drosophila simulans. We conclude that D. simulans chromosome 4 is substantially smaller than that of D. melanogaster, presumably owing to differences in the amount of heterochromatic DNA sequences. Our simple DNA preparation from embryos and PFGE conditions should permit preparative isolation of chromosome 4 DNA and will facilitate the molecular mapping of this chromosome.",1993,"J Locke, H E McDermid"
Molecular analysis of evolutionary changes in the expression of Drosophila esterases,1700427,10.1073/pnas.87.21.8217,"Drosophila melanogaster transformed with the esterase 5 (Est-5) gene from Drosophila pseudoobscura were used to assess the evolutionary basis for differences in the sex- and tissue-specific expression of the esterase 5 (EST 5) enzyme in D. pseudoobscura relative to its homologue in D. melanogaster, EST 6. EST 5 is expressed in the eyes and hemolymph of transformed D. melanogaster just as it is in D. pseudoobscura, but it is not detectable in the ejaculatory duct, where the homologous enzyme, EST 6, is most abundant. EST 5 also occurs at equal levels in both sexes of the transformants and D. pseudoobscura, whereas EST 6 is more abundant in male than in female D. melanogaster. Northern analysis of transformed and untransformed flies indicates that the expression patterns of EST 5 and EST 6 are controlled at the level of transcription and suggests that regulatory differences between Est-6 and Est-5 have evolved mainly through cis-acting regulatory changes in the two loci rather than through alterations in trans-acting factors. Equal expression of EST 5 in male and female transformants also indicates that the X-chromosome-linked Est-5 gene of D. pseudoobscura, when isolated as a 4.5-kilobase restriction fragment, is not dosage compensated after integration into an autosome of D. melanogaster.",1990,"J P Brady, R C Richmond"
Evidence for horizontal transmission of the P transposable element between Drosophila species,2155157,,"Several studies have suggested that P elements have rapidly spread through natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster within the last four decades. This observation, together with the observation that P elements are absent in the other species of the melanogaster subgroup, has lead to the suggestion that P elements may have entered the D. melanogaster genome by horizontal transmission from some more distantly related species. In an effort to identify the potential donor in the horizontal transfer event, we have undertaken an extensive survey of the genus Drosophila using Southern blot analysis. The results showed that P-homologous sequences are essentially confined to the subgenus Sophophora. The strongest P hybridization occurs in species from the closely related willistoni group. A wild-derived strain of D. willistoni was subsequently selected for a more comprehensive molecular examination. As part of the analysis, a complete P element was cloned and sequenced from this line. Its nucleotide sequence was found to be identical to the D. melanogaster canonical P, with the exception of a single base substitution at position 32. When the cloned element was injected into D. melanogaster embryos, it was able to both promote transposition of a coinjected marked transposon and induce singed-weak mutability, thus demonstrating its ability to function as an autonomous element. The results of this study suggest that D. willistoni may have served as the donor species in the horizontal transfer of P elements to D. melanogaster.",1990,"S B Daniels, K R Peterson, L D Strausbaugh, M G Kidwell, A Chovnick"
"Comparison of the Drosophila melanogaster, human and murine Sm B cDNAs: evolutionary conservation",7680326,10.1016/0378-1119(93)90404-q,"To analyze the evolutionary stability of the Sm B polypeptides, the cDNA nucleotide (nt) sequence was derived for the Drosophila melanogaster Sm B polypeptide and compared to the cDNAs encoding human and murine Sm B. The three cDNAs were transcribed and translated in reticulocyte lysates followed by analysis of the synthesized proteins by SDS-PAGE. D. melanogaster B migrated at approximately 25 kDa, in comparison to 28 kDa for the murine and human B proteins, although all three proteins were immunoprecipitated by human anti-Sm autoantibodies and by the Y12 anti-Sm murine monoclonal antibody (Y12 mAb). Immunoblots and immunoprecipitations of [35S]methionine-labeled D. melanogaster S2/M3 cells confirmed the smaller size of the D. melanogaster protein, and revealed that B' was absent in this cell line, as in murine cells. In comparison to the 231 amino acids (aa) of human and murine B, the deduced sequence for the D. melanogaster clone was 199 aa (predicted M(r) of 24,598) with two 5-aa deletions and a 19-aa truncation at the 3' end, compared to the other two clones. D. melanogaster protein B shared 65% aa sequence identity with the human and mouse clones, and 80% similarity when conservative aa substitutions were noted. The C-terminal portion of the D. melanogaster protein was the most evolutionarily variable in comparison to the deduced aa sequences for the other two proteins; however, autoantigenic epitopes bound by human anti-Sm antibodies and the Y12 mAb in this region of the protein were conserved across species lines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1993,"C Brunet, T Quan, J Craft"
Ribosome profiling reveals pervasive and regulated stop codon readthrough in Drosophila melanogaster,24302569,10.7554/eLife.01179,"Ribosomes can read through stop codons in a regulated manner, elongating rather than terminating the nascent peptide. Stop codon readthrough is essential to diverse viruses, and phylogenetically predicted to occur in a few hundred genes in Drosophila melanogaster, but the importance of regulated readthrough in eukaryotes remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a ribosome profiling assay (deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments) for Drosophila melanogaster, and provide the first genome-wide experimental analysis of readthrough. Readthrough is far more pervasive than expected: the vast majority of readthrough events evolved within D. melanogaster and were not predicted phylogenetically. The resulting C-terminal protein extensions show evidence of selection, contain functional subcellular localization signals, and their readthrough is regulated, arguing for their importance. We further demonstrate that readthrough occurs in yeast and humans. Readthrough thus provides general mechanisms both to regulate gene expression and function, and to add plasticity to the proteome during evolution.

Multiple capacitors for natural genetic variation in Drosophila melanogaster,23110557,10.1111/mec.12091,"Cryptic genetic variation (CGV) or a standing genetic variation that is not ordinarily expressed as a phenotype is released when the robustness of organisms is impaired under environmental or genetic perturbations. Evolutionary capacitors modulate the amount of genetic variation exposed to natural selection and hidden cryptically; they have a fundamental effect on the evolvability of traits on evolutionary timescales. In this study, I have demonstrated the effects of multiple genomic regions of Drosophila melanogaster on CGV in wing shape. I examined the effects of 61 genomic deficiencies on quantitative and qualitative natural genetic variation in the wing shape of D. melanogaster. I have identified 10 genomic deficiencies that do not encompass a known candidate evolutionary capacitor, Hsp90, exposing natural CGV differently depending on the location of the deficiencies in the genome. Furthermore, five genomic deficiencies uncovered qualitative CGV in wing morphology. These findings suggest that CGV in wing shape of wild-type D. melanogaster is regulated by multiple capacitors with divergent functions. Future analysis of genes encompassed by these genomic regions would help elucidate novel capacitor genes and better understand the general features of capacitors regarding natural genetic variation.",2013,Kazuo H Takahashi
Drosophila melanogaster as a model host for Staphylococcus aureus infection,15256576,10.1099/mic.0.27116-0,"Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen of humans, causing a range of superficial and potentially life-threatening diseases. Infection of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster with S. aureus results in systemic infection followed by death. Screening of defined S. aureus mutants for components important in pathogenesis identified perR and pheP, with fly death up to threefold slower after infection with the respective mutants compared to the wild-type. Infection of D. melanogaster with reporter gene fusion strains demonstrated the in vivo expression levels of the accessory gene regulator, agr, alpha-toxin, hla, and a manganese transporter, mntA. The use of the green fluorescent protein as a reporter under the control of the agr promoter (P3) showed S. aureus microcolony formation in vivo.

Ethanol preference in Drosophila melanogaster is driven by its caloric value,22551215,10.1111/j.1530-0277.2012.01817.x,"Background:
      
    

    
      Perhaps the most difficult thing to ascertain concerning the behavior of another animal is its motivation. The motivation underlying the preference of Drosophila melanogaster for ethanol (EtOH)-rich food has long been ascribed to its value as a food. A recently introduced idea is that, as in humans, the pharmacological effects of EtOH also motivate the fly to choose EtOH-rich food over nonalcoholic food.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Flies are given a choice between pipets that contain liquid food and liquid food supplemented with EtOH. In some experiments, carbohydrates are added to the non-EtOH-containing food to balance the calories for EtOH.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We confirm that D. melanogaster indeed prefer food that is supplemented with EtOH. However, if the alternative food choice is isocaloric, D. melanogaster usually do not show any preference for a 10% EtOH solution. Even after EtOH preference has been established, it can be completely reversed if the alternative food is calorically supplemented. This occurs even when the carbohydrate solution used to balance calories is not gustatorily attractive. Furthermore, if the alternative food contains more calories than the EtOH food, the flies will prefer the non-EtOH food. We go on to show that during the preference assay that EtOH in the fly does not exceed 4 mM, which in mammals is a nonintoxicating dose.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We conclude that preference for EtOH in this assay arises not from the pharmacological effects of EtOH but rather because of its nutritive value.",2012,"Jascha B Pohl, Brett A Baldwin, Boingoc L Dinh, Pinkey Rahman, Dustin Smerek, Francisco J Prado 3rd, Nyssa Sherazee, Nigel S Atkinson"
Nonrandom Wolbachia infection status of Drosophila melanogaster strains with different mtDNA haplotypes,18780877,10.1093/molbev/msn199,"Wolbachia are maternally inherited bacteria, which typically spread in the host population by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). In Drosophila melanogaster, Wolbachia is quite common but CI is variable, with most of the studies reporting low levels of CI. Surveying mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation and infection status in a worldwide D. melanogaster collection, we found that the Wolbachia infection was not randomly distributed among flies with different mtDNA haplotypes. This preferential infection of some mtDNA haplotypes could be caused by a recent spread of mtDNA haplotypes associated with the infection. The comparison of contemporary D. melanogaster samples with lines collected more than 50 years ago shows that indeed one haplotype with a high incidence of Wolbachia infection has increased in frequency. Consistent with this observation, we found that the acquisition of a Wolbachia infection in a population from Crete was accompanied with an almost complete mtDNA replacement, with the Wolbachia-associated haplotype becoming abundant. Although it is difficult to identify the evolutionary forces causing the global increase of wMel, the parallel sweep of Wolbachia and an mtDNA haplotype suggests a fitness advantage of the Wolbachia infection.",2008,"Maria D S Nunes, Viola Nolte, Christian Schlötterer"
P DNA element movement in somatic cells reduces lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster: evidence in support of the somatic mutation theory of aging,7565880,10.1016/0921-8734(95)00009-u,"Evidence is presented in support of the hypothesis that P DNA element movement in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster induces genetic damage that significantly reduces lifespan. The lifespan of D. melanogaster males was significantly reduced by the somatic movement of a single P element in the presence of P[ry+ delta 2-3](99B) transposase. In addition, the P[ry+ SalI](89D) repressor of P[ry+ delta 2-3](99B) somatic transposase was observed to reduce the effect of P element movement on lifespan. Finally, the frequency of somatic-cell chromosome breakage was significantly increased in neuroblasts of males with somatically active P elements. These results show that lifespan in D. melanogaster is decreased with increased somatic genetic damage from DNA-element movement. Although this conclusion does not confirm that transposable element movement is a cause of natural senescence, this conclusion is clear evidence in support of a close relationship between somatic genetic damage and aging.",1995,"R C Woodruff, A G Nikitin"
The adenosine2 gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a formylglycineamide ribotide amidotransferase,8270203,10.1139/g93-122,"Drosophila melanogaster genomic DNA spanning an adenosine2 gene rearrangement breakpoint (in cytological map region 26B1-2) was cloned and a composite ade2 base sequence was derived from this DNA and from a corresponding cDNA. Based on genetic evidence, the ade2 gene is thought to encode the purine biosynthetic enzyme formylglycineamide ribotide amidotransferase (FGARAT). The cDNA hybridizes to a 4.8-kb message that encodes a 1354 amino acid polypeptide with extensive similarity to Escherichia coli FGARAT. The D. melanogaster FGARAT amino acid sequence is considerably more like that of the E. coli enzyme than is the FGARAT of B. subtilis, which has two polypeptides with, collectively, 969 amino acids. It is suggested that the taxonomically anomalous similarity between the eukaryotic FGARAT and that from E. coli may indicate horizontal exchange of genetic material. On the basis of substantially greater conservation of sequences shared by all three species compared with those present only in E. coli and D. melanogaster, we suggest that no radical alteration of enzymatic function accompanied the transition between the single-gene and the two-gene state.",1993,"S Y Tiong, D Nash"
Transformation of cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells with a dominant selectable marker,3018529,10.1128/mcb.5.8.1833,"We have developed a method for the stable and efficient introduction of foreign DNA into Drosophila melanogaster tissue culture cells.

After calcium phosphate-DNA transfection, this vector rendered D. melanogaster cells resistant to the aminoglycoside G-418, a derivative of gentamicin. The vector DNA appeared to be integrated in long tandem arrays of 10 to 20 copies per cell and was stable for many generations in the absence of selection. To test the usefulness of this system for introducing nonselected DNA into D. melanogaster cells, a gene fusion between the P transposable element and the hsp70 promoter was inserted into the copia-neomycin resistance plasmid.

Individual variation of natural D.melanogaster-associated bacterial communities,29385453,10.1093/femsle/fny017,"Drosophila melanogaster has become an important model organism to study host-microbe interaction in the laboratory. However, the natural microbial communities that are associated with D. melanogaster have received less attention. Especially, information on inter-individual variation is still lacking, because most studies so far have used pooled material from several flies. Here, we collected bacterial 16S rRNA gene community profiles from a set of 32 individuals from a single population. We simulated pools from the individual data (i) to assess how well the microbiome of a host population is represented by pools, and (ii) to compare variation of Drosophila microbiomes within and between populations. Taxon richness was increased in simulated pools, suggesting that pools paint a more comprehensive picture of the taxa associated with a host population. Furthermore, microbiome composition varied less between pools than between individuals, indicating that differences even out in pools. Variation in microbiome composition was larger between populations than between simulated pools from a single population, adding to the notion that there are population-specific effects on the Drosophila microbiome. Surprisingly, samples from individuals clustered into two groups, suggesting that there are yet unknown factors that affect the composition of natural fly-associated microbial communities and need further research.",2018,"Yun Wang, Fabian Staubach"
Molecular identification of the active ninja retrotransposon and the inactive aurora element in Drosophila simulans and D. melanogaster,10333568,10.1266/ggs.73.385,"How transposable elements evolve is a key facet in understanding of spontaneous mutation and genomic rearrangements in various organisms. One of the best ways to approach this question is to study a newly evolved transposable element whose presence is restricted to a specific population or strain. The retrotransposons ninja and aurora may provide insights into the process of their evolution, because of their contrasting characteristics, even though they show high sequence identity. The ninja retrotransposon was found in a Drosophila simulans strain in high copy number and is potent in transposition. On the other hand, aurora elements are distributed widely among the species belonging to the Drosophila melanogaster species complex, but are immobile at least in D. melanogaster. In order to distinguish the two closely resembled retrotransposons by molecular means, we determined and compared DNA sequence of the elements, and identified characteristic internal deletions and nucleotide substitutions in 5'-long terminal repeats (LTR). Analyses of the structure of ninja homologs and LTR sequences amplified from both genomic and cloned DNA revealed that the actively transposable ninja elements were present only in D. simulans strains, but inactive aurora elements exist in both D. melanogaster and D. simulans.",1998,"Y Kanamori, H Hayashi, M T Yamamoto"

Concomitant changes in radiation resistance and trehalose levels during life stages of Drosophila melanogaster suggest radio-protective function of trehalose,29613812,10.1080/09553002.2018.1460499,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      During development, various life stages of Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster) show different levels of resistance to gamma irradiation, with the early pupal stage being the most radiation sensitive. This provides us an opportunity to explore the biochemical basis of such variations. The present study was carried out to understand the mechanisms underlying radiation resistance during life stages of D. melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Homogenates from all the life stages of D. melanogaster were prepared at stipulated age. These homogenates were used for the determination of (1) enzymatic antioxidants: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, D. melanogaster glutathione peroxidase (DmGPx), and glutathione S-transferase (GST); (2) reducing non-enzymatic antioxidants: total antioxidant capacity (TAC), reduced glutathione (GSH) and non-reducing non-enzymatic antioxidant trehalose; and (3) levels of protein carbonyl (PC) content. Age-dependent changes in radiation resistance and associated biochemical changes were also studied in young (2 d) and old (20 and 30 d) flies.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      TAC and GSH were found high in the early pupal stage, whereas catalase and DmGPx were found to increase in the early pupal stage. The non-feeding third instar (NFTI) larvae were found to have high levels of SOD and GST, besides NFTI larvae showed high levels of trehalose. A remarkable decrease was observed in radiation resistance and trehalose levels during the early pupal stage. The PC level was the highest during early pupal stage and was the lowest in NFTI larvae. Older flies showed high level of PC compared with young flies.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      In vitro increments in trehalose concentration correspond to reduced formation of PCs, suggesting a protective role of trehalose against free radicals. A strong correlation between levels of trehalose and PC formation suggests amelioration of proteome damage due to ionizing radiation (IR). Stages with high trehalose levels showed protected proteome and high radiation resistance, suggesting a significant role for this disaccharide in radiation resistance.",2018,"Jagdish Gopal Paithankar, Shamprasad Varija Raghu, Rajashekhar K Patil"
Adaptation and Conservation throughout the Drosophila melanogaster Life-Cycle,31028390,10.1093/gbe/evz086,"Previous studies of the evolution of genes expressed at different life-cycle stages of Drosophila melanogaster have not been able to disentangle adaptive from nonadaptive substitutions when using nonsynonymous sites. Here, we overcome this limitation by combining whole-genome polymorphism data from D. melanogaster and divergence data between D. melanogaster and Drosophila yakuba. For the set of genes expressed at different life-cycle stages of D. melanogaster, as reported in modENCODE, we estimate the ratio of substitutions relative to polymorphism between nonsynonymous and synonymous sites (α) and then α is discomposed into the ratio of adaptive (ωa) and nonadaptive (ωna) substitutions to synonymous substitutions. We find that the genes expressed in mid- and late-embryonic development are the most conserved, whereas those expressed in early development and postembryonic stages are the least conserved. Importantly, we found that low conservation in early development is due to high rates of nonadaptive substitutions (high ωna), whereas in postembryonic stages it is due, instead, to high rates of adaptive substitutions (high ωa). By using estimates of different genomic features (codon bias, average intron length, exon number, recombination rate, among others), we also find that genes expressed in mid- and late-embryonic development show the most complex architecture: they are larger, have more exons, more transcripts, and longer introns. In addition, these genes are broadly expressed among all stages. We suggest that all these genomic features are related to the conservation of mid- and late-embryonic development. Globally, our study supports the hourglass pattern of conservation and adaptation over the life-cycle.",2019,"Marta Coronado-Zamora, Irepan Salvador-Martínez, David Castellano, Antonio Barbadilla, Isaac Salazar-Ciudad"
A comparison of Frost expression among species and life stages of Drosophila,21955087,10.1111/j.1365-2583.2011.01108.x,"Frost (Fst) is a gene associated with cold exposure in Drosophila melanogaster. We used real-time PCR to assess whether cold exposure induces expression of Fst in 10 different life stages of D. melanogaster, and adults of seven other Drosophila species. We exposed groups of individuals to 0 °C (2 h), followed by 1 h recovery (22 °C). Frost was significantly upregulated in response to cold in eggs, third instar larvae, and 2- and 5-day-old male and female adults in D. melanogaster. Life stages in which cold did not upregulate Fst had high constitutive expression. Frost is located on the opposite strand of an intron of Diuretic hormone (DH), but cold exposure did not upregulate DH. Frost orthologues were identified in six other species within the Melanogaster group (Drosophila sechellia, Drosophila simulans, Drosophila yakuba, Drosophila erecta, Drosophila ananassae and Drosophila mauritiana). Frost orthologues were upregulated in response to cold exposure in both sexes in adults of all of these species. The predicted structure of a putative Frost consensus protein shows highly conserved tandem repeats of motifs involved in cell signalling (PEST and TRAF2), suggesting that Fst might encode an adaptor protein involved in acute stress or apoptosis signalling in vivo.",2012,"X Bing, J Zhang, Brent J Sinclair"
Evolution of the secondary structures and compensatory mutations of the ribosomal RNAs of Drosophila melanogaster,3136295,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040501,"This paper examines the effects of DNA sequence evolution on RNA secondary structures and compensatory mutations. Models of the secondary structures of Drosophila melanogaster 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and of the complex between 2S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs have been drawn on the basis of comparative and energetic criteria. The overall AU richness of the D. melanogaster rRNAs allows the resolution of some ambiguities in the structures of both large rRNAs. Comparison of the sequence of expansion segment V2 in D. melanogaster 18S rRNA with the same region in three other Drosophila species and the tsetse fly (Glossina morsitans morsitans) allows us to distinguish between two models for the secondary structure of this region. The secondary structures of the expansion segments of D. melanogaster 28S rRNA conform to a general pattern for all eukaryotes, despite having highly divergent sequences between D. melanogaster and vertebrates. The 70 novel compensatory mutations identified in the 28S rRNA show a strong (70%) bias toward A-U base pairs, suggesting that a process of biased mutation and/or biased fixation of A and T point mutations or AT-rich slippage-generated motifs has occurred during the evolution of D. melanogaster rDNA. This process has not occurred throughout the D. melanogaster genome. The processes by which compensatory pairs of mutations are generated and spread are discussed, and a model is suggested by which a second mutation is more likely to occur in a unit with a first mutation as such a unit begins to spread through the family and concomitantly through the population. Alternatively, mechanisms of proofreading in stem-loop structures at the DNA level, or between RNA and DNA, might be involved. The apparent tolerance of noncompensatory mutations in some stems which are otherwise strongly supported by comparative criteria within D. melanogaster 28S rRNA must be borne in mind when compensatory mutations are used as a criterion in secondary-structure modeling. Noncompensatory mutation may extend to the production of unstable structures where a stem is stabilized by RNA-protein or additional RNA-RNA interactions in the mature ribosome. Of motifs suggested to be involved in rRNA processing, one (CGAAAG) is strongly overrepresented in the 28S rRNA sequence. The data are discussed both in the context of the forces involved with the evolution of multigene families and in the context of molecular coevolution in the rDNA family in particular.",1988,"J M Hancock, D Tautz, G A Dover"
Loss of reproductive parasitism following transfer of male-killing Wolbachia to Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,22892635,10.1038/hdy.2012.43,"Wolbachia manipulate insect host biology through a variety of means that result in increased production of infected females, enhancing its own transmission.

In this study, we transferred wInn to D. melanogaster and D. simulans by embryonic microinjection, expecting conservation of the male-killing phenotype to the novel hosts, which are more suitable for genetic analysis. In contrast to our expectations, there was no effect on offspring sex ratio. Furthermore, no CI was observed in the transinfected flies. Overall, transinfected D. melanogaster lines displayed lower transmission rate and lower densities of Wolbachia than transinfected D. simulans lines, in which established infections were transmitted with near-perfect fidelity. In D. simulans, strain wInn had no effect on fecundity and egg-to-adult development. Surprisingly, one of the two transinfected lines tested showed increased longevity.

"Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans rescue strains produce fit offspring, despite divergent centromere-specific histone alleles",12815450,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800275,"The interaction between rapidly evolving centromere sequences and conserved kinetochore machinery appears to be mediated by centromere-binding proteins. A recent theory proposes that the independent evolution of centromere-binding proteins in isolated populations may be a universal cause of speciation among eukaryotes. In Drosophila the centromere-specific histone, Cid (centromere identifier), shows extensive sequence divergence between D. melanogaster and the D. simulans clade, indicating that centromere machinery incompatibilities may indeed be involved in reproductive isolation and speciation. However, it is presently unclear whether the adaptive evolution of Cid was a cause of the divergence between these species, or merely a product of postspeciation adaptation in the separate lineages. Furthermore, the extent to which divergent centromere identifier proteins provide a barrier to reproduction remains unknown. Interestingly, a small number of rescue lines from both D. melanogaster and D. simulans can restore hybrid fitness. Through comparisons of cid sequence between nonrescue and rescue strains, we show that cid is not involved in restoring hybrid viability or female fertility. Further, we demonstrate that divergent cid alleles are not sufficient to cause inviability or female sterility in hybrid crosses. Our data do not dispute the rapid divergence of cid or the coevolution of centromeric components in Drosophila; however, they do suggest that cid underwent adaptive evolution after D. melanogaster and D. simulans diverged and, consequently, is not a speciation gene.",2003,"A Sainz, J A Wilder, M Wolf, H Hollocher"

In contrast, only 18 P1 clones and lambda Dsuby hybridized on Muller's A element (XL chromosomal arm) of D. pseudoobscura; 4 additional P1 clones hybridized on Muller's D element (XR chromosomal arm) of this species and the remaining P1 clone gave one hybridization signal on each arm of the X chromosome. This latter clone may contain one breakpoint of a pericentric inversion that may account for the interchange of genetic material between Muller's A and D elements in D. pseudoobscura. In contrast to the rare interchange of genetic material between chromosomal elements, profound differences in the order and spacing of markers were detected between D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura and D. subobscura. In fact, the number of chromosomal segments delimited by identical markers and conserved between pairwise comparisons is small. Therefore, extensive reorganization within Muller's A element has been produced during the divergence of the three species. Rough estimates of the number of cytologically detectable inversions contributing to differentiation of Muller's A element were obtained. The most reliable of these estimates is that obtained from the D. pseudoobscura and D. melanogaster comparison since a greater number of markers have been mapped in both species. Tentatively, one inversion breakpoint about every 200 kb has been produced and fixed during the divergence of D. pseudoobscura and D. melanogaster.",1995,"C Segarra, E R Lozovskaya, G Ribó, M Aguadé, D L Hartl"
Establishing a system with Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae) to assess the non-target effects of gut-active insecticidal compounds,27796688,10.1007/s10646-016-1722-y,"Potentially adverse effects on ecosystem functioning by the planting of insect-resistant, genetically engineered plants or by the direct application of insecticidal compounds are carefully evaluated in pre-market risk assessments. To date, few studies have assessed the potential risks of genetically engineered crops or insecticidal compounds on the survival and fitness of dipteran species, despite their important contribution to ecosystem services such as decomposition in agricultural systems. Therefore, we propose that Drosophila melanogaster Meigen (Drosophilidae) be used as a surrogate species for the order Diptera and for the functional guild of soil arthropod decomposers in pre-market risk assessments. We developed two assays to assess the toxicity of gut-active insecticidal compounds to D. melanogaster. One assay uses groups of fly larvae, and the other uses individuals. Cryolite, a mineral pesticide, proved to be an adequate positive control. The effects of cryolite on D. melanogaster larvae were comparable between the two assays. Statistical power analyses were used to define the number of replications required to identify different effect sizes between control and treatment groups. Finally, avidin, E-64, GNA, and SBTI were used as test compounds to validate the individual-based assay; only avidin adversely affected D. melanogaster. These results indicate that both D. melanogaster assays will be useful for early tier risk assessment concerning the effects of orally active compounds on non-target dipterans.",2016,"Simone Haller, Michael Meissle, Jörg Romeis"

The objective of our study was to investigate the differences in the life span of male Oregon (w.t.) and vestigial Drosophila melanogaster, the possible role of free radical scavengers such as catalase, glutathione reductase and reduced-oxidized glutathione levels in the aging process by studying the pattern of age-related changes. The life span of male Oregon D. melanogaster is longer than that of the vestigial D. melanogaster. The beginning of the dying phase of Oregon was around 40 days, while the vestigial's around 20 days. The maximum life span was 85 days in Oregon population and 56 days in vestigial population. Age-related changes of catalase activities were similar in male Oregon and vestigial and showed a decreasing curve during aging. Glutathione reductase activity of Oregon increased slightly between 10 and 40 days, decreased sharply therafter. Glutathione reductase activity of vestigial followed a pot-shaped trend with 60% decrease during the first 40 days and followed by a sharp increase during the late part of life. The amounts of reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) increased slightly up to 40 days of age and followed a sharp decline thereafter in male Oregon D. melanogaster. In male vestigial D. melanogaster, the concentrations of GSH and GSSG remained quite stable for the nogaster, the concentrations of GSH and GSSG remained quite stable for the first 10 days, followed by a sharp decline around 20th day and increased thereafter.",1994,"K Fiskin, S Kandemir, D Hamamci, E Yesilada, A N Bozcuk"

Frost was expressed during recovery from cold, and was up-regulated during desiccation. Desiccation and starvation (but not cold) elicited increased expression of the senescence-related gene smp-30. Desat2 decreased during recovery from desiccation, but not in response to starvation or cold. Hsp70 expression increased after 1 h of recovery from cold exposure, but was unchanged in response to desiccation or starvation stress, and Hsp23 levels did not respond to any of the stressors. We conclude that D. melanogaster's responses to cold and desiccation are quite different and that care must be taken to separate exposure and recovery when studying responses to environmental stress.",2007,"B J Sinclair, A G Gibbs, S P Roberts"

Patterns of selection: stress resistance and energy storage in density-dependent populations of Drosophila melanogaster,12770141,10.1016/s0022-1910(01)00108-1,"Populations of Drosophila melanogaster subjected to extreme larval (CU) or adult (UC) densities for multiple generations were assayed for a variety of life history characters. When reared under either crowded or uncrowded larval conditions, populations which had been selected to tolerate the limitation of resources imposed by extreme larval (CU) crowding, exhibited greater starvation resistance and lipid content than did populations which do not routinely undergo larval density-dependent regulation. Previous studies have shown that the CU populations do not show a correlated increase in longevity; as has been generally observed for these characteristics in age-structured populations of D. melanogaster. This suggests that density-dependent natural selection may not always shape life histories of the same characteristic in the same direction that age-specific selection does.",2001,"D J. Borash, G T.

piggyBac-mediated transposition in Drosophila melanogaster: an evaluation of the use of constitutive promoters to control transposase gene expression,11881809,,"Transgenic non-Drosophilid insects have been made using insect transposable elements that have a broad host range such as the piggyBac element. However, the success rate is often low. Previous piggyBac helper plasmids have used either the piggyBac or the hsp70 promoter from Drosophila melanogaster to control expression of the transposase gene. Here we show that plasmids with the piggyBac transposase gene regulated by constitutive promoters can be effective 'helpers' for mediating transposition in D. melanogaster. We also present preliminary evidence on the use of an RNA helper that encodes the transposase. Our results suggest that for germ-line transformation of non-Drosophilid insects it may be advantageous to isolate a constitutive promoter from the species of interest to control transposase expression.",2001,"X Li, J C Heinrich, M J Scott"

Sexual mimicry regulates the attractiveness of mated Drosophila melanogaster females,3095835,10.1073/pnas.83.21.8429,"During mating, male Drosophila melanogaster transfer to the female's cuticle a compound (7-tricosene) that is almost absent from virgin females but is the major hydrocarbon component of the male's cuticle. During the first 3 hr after mating, the amount of 7-tricosene on a female decreases sharply but remains significantly above virgin levels. By 6 hr after mating, female synthesis of 7-tricosene has increased, and females release it when they are exposed to courting males. Transfer of 7-tricosene to immature virgin females by courting males significantly decreases their attractiveness, so 7-tricosene has demonstrable antiaphrodisiac properties. Thus, mated D. melanogaster females appear to mimic males by releasing, during courtship, an antiasphrodisiac pheromone that is almost absent from virgin females but is the most prominent hydrocarbon of the male cuticle.",1986,D Scott
Tissue localization of Drosophila melanogaster ras transcripts during development,3097510,10.1128/mcb.6.6.2241,"Three ras homologs have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we describe the tissue distribution of their transcripts as analyzed by in situ hybridization. The RNAs of the three genes show a similar distribution at every developmental stage examined. In embryos, the transcripts are uniformly distributed. In larvae, ras transcripts are restricted to dividing cells (e.g., imaginal disks, gonads, and brain). At the adult stage, several tissues contain ras transcripts. The strongest hybridization signals are localized to the adult ovaries and to the cortex of the brain and ganglia, which at this stage are comprised of differentiated, nondividing cells. The tissue distribution of ras transcripts in D. melanogaster suggests that the ras proteins have multiple roles during development which may be related to both the proliferative and differentiated states of the tissues.",1986,"D Segal, B Z Shilo"
Temperature and clinal variation in larval growth efficiency in Drosophila melanogaster,29280588,10.1046/j.1420-9101.2001.00259.x,"Geographic clines in ectotherm species including Drosophila melanogaster have been found throughout the world, with genetically larger body size and shorter development time occurring at high latitudes. Temperature is thought to play a major role in the evolution of this clinal variation. Laboratory thermal selection has effects similar to those seen in geographical clines. Evolution at low temperatures results in more rapid development to larger adult flies. This study investigated the effects of geographical origin and experimental temperature on larval growth efficiency in D. melanogaster. Larvae from populations that had evolved at high latitudes were found to use limited food more efficiently, so that the overall adult body size achieved was larger. Larvae reared at a lower experimental temperature (18 °C) used food more efficiently than those reared at a higher temperature (25 °C). The increases in growth efficiency found in populations from high latitudes could explain their increased body size and more rapid development.",2001,"S J W Robinson, L Partridge"
Oxidative Effects of Gemifloxacin on Some Biological Traits of Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae),30994172,10.1093/ee/nvz039,"In recent times, several studies have been undertaken on the artificial mass-rearing of insects in which clinical antibacterial antibiotics, including gemifloxacin, which is a DNA gyrase and topoisomerases inhibitor, are amended into the diet to control microbial contamination and preserve diet. The findings of these studies have suggested the possibility that these antibiotics influence the biological traits of insects in relation to their oxidative effects. This study investigated the effects of gemifloxacin on Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) survival rates, development times, and male-female adult longevity. And we also determined the effects of gemifloxacin on lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl levels, and glutathione S-transferase activity of fruit fly eggs. First instars were fed on artificial diets containing 150, 300, 600, and 900 mg/liter concentrations of gemifloxacin until adult emergence. Our results indicate that sublethal effects of gemifloxacin are likely to significantly impair adult fitness and life-history parameters in D. melanogaster, probably because of its oxidative effects.",2019,"Nilay Aslan, Ender Büyükgüzel, Kemal Büyükgüzel"
Ultrastructure of regions containing homologous loci in polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila subobscura,9601980,10.1007/s004120050287,"We have used a new approach involving in situ hybridisation and electron microscopy to establish ultrastructural homologies between polytene chromosome regions of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila subobscura.

Most of these loci were previously undescribed in D. subobscura and imprecisely located in D. melanogaster. We have demonstrated here, by an ultrastructural analysis of each chromosomal region, that homologous genetic loci tend to show a similar ultrastructure in the two species. With a few exceptions, the structural homology extends to the chromosomal regions surrounding the loci. In some cases, however, no structurally recognisable homology can be seen either in the locus or in its flanking regions.",1998,"J B Cuenca, M I Galindo, A O Saura, V Sorsa, R de Frutos"
Drosophila melanogaster NEP2 is a new soluble member of the neprilysin family of endopeptidases with implications for reproduction and renal function,15554877,10.1042/BJ20041753,"The mammalian neprilysin (NEP) family members are typically type II membrane endopeptidases responsible for the activation/inactivation of neuropeptides and peptide hormones. Differences in substrate specificity and subcellular localization of the seven mammalian NEPs contribute to their functional diversity. The sequencing of the Drosophila melanogaster genome has revealed a large expansion of this gene family, resulting in over 20 fly NEP-like genes, suggesting even greater diversity in structure and function than seen in mammals. We now report that one of these genes (Nep2) codes for a secreted endopeptidase with a highly restricted pattern of expression. D. melanogaster NEP2 is expressed in the specialized stellate cells of the renal tubules and in the cyst cells that surround the elongating spermatid bundles in adult testis, suggesting roles for the peptidase in renal function and in spermatogenesis. D. melanogaster NEP2 was found in vesicle-like structures in the syncytial cytoplasm of the spermatid bundles, suggesting that the protein was acquired by endocytosis of protein secreted from the cyst cells. Expression of NEP2 cDNA in D. melanogaster S2 cells confirmed that the peptidase is secreted and is only weakly inhibited by thiorphan, a potent inhibitor of human NEP. D. melanogaster NEP2 also differs from human NEP in the manner in which the peptidase cleaves the tachykinin, GPSGFYGVR-amide. Molecular modelling suggests that there are important structural differences between D. melanogaster NEP2 and human NEP in the S1' and S2' ligand-binding subsites, which might explain the observed differences in inhibitor and substrate specificities. A soluble isoform of a mouse NEP-like peptidase is strongly expressed in spermatids, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for a soluble endopeptidase in spermatogenesis.",2005,"Josie E Thomas, Caroline M Rylett, Ahmet Carhan, Nicholas D Bland, Richard J Bingham, Alan D Shirras, Anthony J Turner, R Elwyn Isaac"

Here we have used PCR and Southern blots to screen for sequences similar to copia element in South American populations of D. willistoni, as well as in strains previously shown to be carriers of the element. We have not found the canonical copia element in any of these populations. Unlike the P element, which invaded the D. melanogaster genome from D. willistoni and quickly spread worldwide, the canonical copia element appears to have transferred in the opposite direction and has not spread.

Correlated changes in life history traits in response to selection for faster pre-adult development in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,24523501,10.1242/jeb.093864,"Insects including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster are under intense pressure to develop rapidly because they inhabit ephemeral habitats. We have previously shown that when selection for faster development was artificially imposed on D. melanogaster in the laboratory, reduction of pre-adult development time and shortening of the clock period occurs, suggesting a role for circadian clocks in the regulation of life history traits. Circadian clocks in D. melanogaster have also been implicated in the control of metabolic pathways, ageing processes, oxidative stress and defense responses to exogenous stressors. In order to rigorously examine correlations between pre-adult development time and other life history traits, we assayed pre-adult survivorship, starvation and desiccation resistance, body size and body weight, fecundity and adult lifespan in faster developing populations of D. melanogaster. The results revealed that selection for faster pre-adult development significantly reduced several adult fitness traits in the faster developing flies without affecting pre-adult survivorship. Although overall fecundity of faster developing flies was reduced, their egg output per unit body weight was significantly higher than that of controls, indicating that reduction in adult lifespan might be due to disproportionate investment in reproduction. Thus our results suggest that selection for faster pre-adult development in D. melanogaster yields flies with higher reproductive fitness. Because these flies also have shorter clock periods, our results can be taken to suggest that pre-adult development time and circadian clock period are correlated with various adult life history traits in D. melanogaster, implying that circadian clocks may have adaptive significance.",2014,"Pankaj Yadav, Vijay Kumar Sharma"
Structure and sequence of the Drosophila melanogaster calmodulin gene,3119855,10.1016/0022-2836(87)90025-8,"A series of phage clones overlapping the single calmodulin gene locus of Drosophila melanogaster has been isolated and the exons of the gene positioned and sequenced within these clones. A calmodulin cDNA clone of the electric eel was used to identify these clones and to position the two major protein-coding exons of the gene. cDNA clones for D. melanogaster calmodulin were then isolated, characterized and used to identify the remaining exons. The gene consists of four exons separated by three introns of 3400 to 4300 bases in length. Exon 1 consists of the 5' untranslated region and the initiator ATG; exon 2 encodes amino acid residues 1 to 58.3; exon 3 encodes residues 58.3 to 139.3; and exon 4 encodes residues 139.3 to 148 and the 3' untranslated region. From the sequence of the 3' untranslated region and the lengths of the cDNA clones, two or three polyadenylation sites are indicated. Sequences potentially involved in the control of transcription of the gene and splicing of the mRNA product have been identified. Comparison of the intron-exon structures of the D. melanogaster calmodulin gene, the chick calmodulin gene, and other genes of the troponin C superfamily reinforces previous hypotheses that these genes arose from a common progenitor and permits identification of four introns that were probably present in the progenitor gene structure. The D. melanogaster calmodulin gene contains three of these introns, and the chick gene contains all four. These gene comparisons also indicate that the region of these genes encoding Ca2+-binding loop 3 is highly variable in structure. The chick and D. melanogaster calmodulin genes differ in this region, the chick gene containing a fifth intron here that is absent from the D. melanogaster gene.",1987,"V L Smith, K E Doyle, J F Maune, R P Munjaal, K Beckingham"
Dietary consumption of monosodium L-glutamate induces adaptive response and reduction in the life span of Drosophila melanogaster,28303588,10.1002/cbf.3259,"Adaptive response is the ability of an organism to better counterattack stress-induced damage in response to a number of different cytotoxic agents. Monosodium L-glutamate (MSG), the sodium salt of amino acid glutamate, is commonly used as a food additive. We investigated the effects of MSG on the life span and antioxidant response in Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster). Both genders (1 to 3 days old) of flies were fed with diet containing MSG (0.1, 0.5, and 2.5-g/kg diet) for 5 days to assess selected antioxidant and oxidative stress markers, while flies for longevity were fed for lifetime. Thereafter, the longevity assay, hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species levels were determined. Also, catalase, glutathione S-transferase and acetylcholinesterase activities, and total thiol content were evaluated in the flies. We found that MSG reduced the life span of the flies by up to 23% after continuous exposure. Also, MSG increased reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and H2 O2 generations and total thiol content as well as the activities of catalase and glutathione S-transferase in D. melanogaster (P < .05). In conclusion, consumption of MSG for 5 days by D. melanogaster induced adaptive response, but long-term exposure reduced life span of flies.

Epimedium is a famous medicinal plant in China, Southeast Asian and some other regions. Flavonoids are regarded as its supremely important active constituents used in phytomedicines and/or functional foods. It is of theoretical and applied significance to optimize the procedure for extraction of flavonoids with high bioactivity from Epimedium, to unveil extraction mechanism, to identify chemical composition of flavonoids, to analyze free radical-scavenging ability of flavonoids, and to investigate their effects on the model organism Drosophila melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Box-Behnken design was applied to optimization of extraction procedure. Laser diffraction particle size analysis was used to clarify extraction mechanism. Chemical composition of flavonoids was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. Antiradical capacities of flavonoids were determined by chemical-based assay. Then, effects of flavonoids on catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in D. melanogaster were investigated for the first time.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The optimal condition for ultrasonic extraction of antioxidant flavonoids from Epimedium pubescens was achieved and extraction mechanism was discussed. Epimedium flavonoids contained icariin, epimedin A, epimedin B and epimedin C. Epimedium flavonoids exhibited the ability to scavenge ABTS+ and DPPH⋅ radicals with EC50 values of 55.8 and 52.1 µg/ml, respectively. Moreover, Epimedium flavonoids were able to increase activities of CAT and GSH-Px in D. melanogaster. For females, oral administration of flavonoids improved CAT and GSH-Px activities by 13.58% and 5.18%, respectively. For males, oral administration of flavonoids increased CAT and GSH-Px activities by 13.90% and 5.65%, respectively.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Flavonoids ultrasonically extracted from E. pubescens considerably affected antioxidant defense system in D. melanogaster. Flavonoids of E. pubescens showed great potential for becoming a natural antioxidant because of their antiradical ability and effects on CAT and GSH-Px of the model organism.",2020,"Xiao-Hua Yang, Lu Li, Yao-Bi Xue, Xue-Xue Zhou, Jie-Hua Tang"
Expression of the major heat shock gene of Drosophila melanogaster in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,3010243,10.1093/nar/14.8.3587,"A copy of the gene which encodes the major heat shock protein (hsp70) of D. melanogaster was integrated in both orientations into the genome of S. cerevisiae at the leu2 locus. The level of transcript from the D. melanogaster gene was measured under both normal conditions and conditions which are known to give rise to the heat shock response in S. cerevisiae. In both orientations the D. melanogaster gene gave rise to an abundant transcript in uninduced cells. The level of this transcript was increased transiently on heat shock, peaking after about 30 min at the elevated temperature. The average induction observed was around 5-fold. Although the D. melanogaster gene is heat inducible in S. cerevisiae, the transcripts are initiated at several sites which lie between 10 and 40 base pairs downstream of the initiation site in D. melanogaster. Thus, the transcriptional apparatus of S. cerevisiae appears to recognize the promoter and regulatory elements of the D. melanogaster major heat shock gene, although the manner in which transcription is initiated differs between the two species.",1986,"J S de Banzie, L Sinclair, J T Lis"
Patterns of mutation and selection at synonymous sites in Drosophila,18000010,10.1093/molbev/msm196,"That natural selection affects molecular evolution at synonymous sites in protein-coding sequences is well established and is thought to predominantly reflect selection for translational efficiency/accuracy mediated through codon bias. However, a recently developed maximum likelihood framework, when applied to 18 coding sequences in 3 species of Drosophila, confirmed an earlier report that the Notch gene in Drosophila melanogaster was evolving under selection in favor of those codons defined as unpreferred in this species. This finding opened the possibility that synonymous sites may be subject to a variety of selective pressures beyond weak selection for increased frequencies of the codons currently defined as ""preferred"" in D. melanogaster. To further explore patterns of synonymous site evolution in Drosophila in a lineage-specific manner, we expanded the application of the maximum likelihood framework to 8,452 protein coding sequences with well-defined orthology in D. melanogaster, Drosophila sechellia, and Drosophila yakuba. Our analyses reveal intragenomic and interspecific variation in mutational patterns as well as in patterns and intensity of selection on synonymous sites. In D. melanogaster, our results provide little statistical evidence for recent selection on synonymous sites, and Notch remains an outlier. In contrast, in D. sechellia our findings provide evidence in support of selection predominantly in favor of preferred codons. However, there is a small subset of genes in this species that appear to be evolving under selection in favor of unpreferred codons, which indicates that selection on synonymous sites is not limited to the preferential fixation of mutations that enhance the speed or accuracy of translation in this species.",2007,"Nadia D Singh, Vanessa L Bauer DuMont, Melissa J Hubisz, Rasmus Nielsen, Charles F Aquadro"
"Identification of a Drosophila melanogaster ICE/CED-3-related protease, drICE",9184225,10.1093/emboj/16.10.2805,"Cysteine proteases of the ICE/CED-3 family (caspases) are required for the execution of programmed cell death (PCD) in a wide range of multicellular organisms. Caspases are implicated in the execution of apoptosis in Drosophila melanogaster by the observation that expression of baculovirus p35, a caspase inhibitor, blocks cell death in vivo in Drosophila. We report here the identification and characterization of drICE, a D. melanogaster caspase. We show that overexpression of drICE sensitizes Drosophila cells to apoptotic stimuli and that expression of an N-terminally truncated form of drICE rapidly induces apoptosis in Drosophila cells. Induction of apoptosis by rpr overexpression or by cycloheximide or etoposide treatment of Drosophila cells results in proteolytic processing of drICE. We further show that drICE is a cysteine protease that cleaves baculovirus p35 and Drosophila lamin DmO in vitro and that drICE is expressed at all the stages of Drosophila development at which PCD can be induced. Taken together, these results strongly argue that drICE is an apoptotic caspase that acts downstream of rpr. drICE is therefore the first unequivocal link between the molecular machinery of Drosophila cell death and the conserved machinery of Caenorhabditis elegans and vertebrates. Identification of drICE should facilitate the elucidation of upstream regulators and downstream targets of caspases by genetic screening.",1997,"A G Fraser, G I Evan"
Olfactory detection of a bacterial short-chain fatty acid acts as an orexigenic signal in Drosophila melanogaster larvae,29079812,10.1038/s41598-017-14589-1,"Microorganisms inhabiting fermenting fruit produce chemicals that elicit strong behavioral responses in flies. Depending on their ecological niche, individuals confer a positive or a negative valence to a chemical and, accordingly, they trigger either attractive or repulsive behaviors. We studied the case of bacterial short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) that trigger opposite behaviors in adult and larvae of Drosophila melanogaster. We determined that SCFA-attractive responses depend on two larval exclusive chemoreceptors, Or30a and Or94b. Of those SCFA, propionic acid improves larval survival in suboptimal rearing conditions and supports growth. Olfactory detection of propionic acid specifically is sufficient to trigger feeding behaviors, and this effect requires the correct activity of Or30a+ and Or94b+ olfactory sensory neurons. Additionally, we studied the case of the invasive pest Drosophila suzukii that lives on undamaged ripe fruit with less SCFA production. Contrary to D. melanogaster, D. suzukii larvae show reduced attraction towards propionic acid, which does not trigger feeding behavior in this invasive species. Our results demonstrate the relevance of propionic acid as an orexigenic signal in D. melanogaster larvae. Moreover, this study underlines that the changes on ecological niche are accompanied with alterations of olfactory preferences and vital olfactory driven behaviors.",2017,"Ana Depetris-Chauvin, Diego Galagovsky, Charlene Chevalier, Gerard Maniere, Yael Grosjean"
Egg-laying rhythm in Drosophila melanogaster,19147938,10.1007/s12041-008-0072-9,"Extensive research has been carried out to understand how circadian clocks regulate various physiological processes in organisms. The discovery of clock genes and the molecular clockwork has helped researchers to understand the possible role of these genes in regulating various metabolic processes. In Drosophila melanogaster, many studies have shown that the basic architecture of circadian clocks is multi-oscillatory. In nature, different neuronal subgroups in the brain of D. melanogaster have been demonstrated to control different circadian behavioural rhythms or different aspects of the same circadian rhythm. Among the circadian phenomena that have been studied so far in Drosophila, the egg-laying rhythm is unique, and relatively less explored. Unlike most other circadian rhythms, the egg-laying rhythm is rhythmic under constant light conditions, and the endogenous or free-running period of the rhythm is greater than those of most other rhythms. Although the clock genes and neurons required for the persistence of adult emergence and activity/rest rhythms have been studied extensively, those underlying the circadian egg-laying rhythm still remain largely unknown. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the circadian egg-laying rhythm in D. melanogaster, and the possible molecular and physiological mechanisms that control the rhythmic output of the egg-laying process.",2008,"Manjunatha T, Shantala Hari Dass, Vijay Kumar Sharma"
Male development time influences the strength of Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility expression in Drosophila melanogaster,17660578,10.1534/genetics.106.068486,"Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) is the most widespread reproductive modification induced in insects by the maternally inherited intracellular bacteria, Wolbachia. Expression of CI in Drosophila melanogaster is quite variable. Published papers typically show that CI expression is weak and often varies between different Drosophila lines and different labs reporting the results. The basis for this variability is not well understood but is often considered to be due to unspecified host genotype interactions with Wolbachia. Here, we show that male development time can greatly influence CI expression in D. melanogaster. In a given family, males that develop fastest express very strong CI. The ""younger brothers"" of these males (males that take longer to undergo larval development) quickly lose their ability to express the CI phenotype as a function of development time. This effect is independent of male age effects and is enhanced when flies are reared under crowded conditions. No correlation is seen between this effect and Wolbachia densities in testes, suggesting that a more subtle interaction between host and symbiont is responsible. The observed younger brother effect may explain much of the reported variability in CI expression in this species. When male development time is controlled, it is possible to obtain consistently high levels of CI expression, which will benefit future studies that wish to use D. melanogaster as a model host to unravel CI mechanisms.",2007,"Ryuichi Yamada, Kevin D Floate, Markus Riegler, Scott L O'Neill"
Molecular population genetics of inducible antibacterial peptide genes in Drosophila melanogaster,12716986,10.1093/molbev/msg109,"Insects respond to septic infection in part by producing a suite of antimicrobial peptides that may be subject to host-pathogen coevolutionary dynamics. In order to infer population genetic forces acting on Drosophila antibacterial peptide genes, we examine global properties of polymorphism and divergence in the Drosophila melanogaster defensin, drosocin, metchnikowin, attacin C, diptericin A, and cecropin A, B, and C genes. As a functional class, antibacterial peptides exhibit low levels of interspecific amino acid divergence. There are multiple amino acid polymorphisms segregating within D. melanogaster, however, a high proportion of which change the charge or polarity of the variable residue. These polymorphisms are particularly prevalent in processed signal and propeptide domains. We find that models of coevolutionary ""arms races"" and selectively maintained hypervariability do not adequately describe the population dynamics of mature antibacterial peptides in D. melanogaster, but that a highly significant excess of high-frequency derived polymorphisms coupled with substantial intralocus linkage disequilibrium suggests that positive selection may act on antibacterial peptide genes. Some attributes of the data may be consistent with a simple demographic model of population founding followed by expansion, but departures from the equilibrium null tend to be more pronounced in the peptide genes than at other loci around the genome.",2003,"Brian P Lazzaro, Andrew G Clark"
A field cage test of the effects of the endosymbiont Wolbachia on Drosophila melanogaster,11595053,10.1046/j.1365-2540.2001.00892.x,"Wolbachia endosymbionts are known to affect the fitness of their hosts, but most of this information is from laboratory studies. In Drosophila melanogaster, Wolbachia frequencies vary clinically in frequency in Australia and may confound climatic adaptation. Here we use field cages in a reciprocal exchange design to test for Wolbachia effects in D. melanogaster in winter at temperate and tropical sites. Infected flies of both populations had a lower fecundity in tropical north Queensland, whilst in temperate southern Victoria Wolbachia effects depended on the nuclear population background. Here infected flies from Victoria were more fecund. Wolbachia also influenced larval/pupal viability in the tropics but this was dependent on population background. In comparisons of the populations, there was no evidence for local adaptation for total fecundity, viability or survival over winter. However, in Victoria, a local population had a higher late-life fecundity than a tropical population from Queensland that had higher early-life fecundity. At a tropical site, local Queensland flies had a higher early fecundity than Victorian flies. In contrast to many laboratory studies, mortality rates in the field cages increased only slightly over time. Both the Wolbachia effects and population differences have not been previously detected in laboratory studies with D. melanogaster and highlight the utility of Drosophila field studies in fitness experiments.",2001,"K Olsen, K T Reynolds, A A Hoffmann"

In this review, we first present new insights gleaned from high-throughput data for population genomics studies of D. melanogaster. We then consider the latest population genomics models for TE evolution and present examples of functional evidence revealed by genome-wide studies of TE population dynamics in D. melanogaster.

In Drosophila melanogaster, the production of endo-siRNAs depends on the RNase III enzyme Dicer-2 (Dcr-2). Loss of dcr-2 function reduces the resistance of adult flies to various stresses and shortens their life span. The mutants also exhibit alterations in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. These findings suggest that the endo-siRNA pathway plays a protective role during exposure to stress and aging in D. melanogaster, possibly by regulating metabolic homeostasis.

Tissue-specific expression of Tirant was detected in the tissues of ovaries in a strain mutant for the flamenco locus. Tirant was found to be transpositionally active in isogenic D. melanogaster strains mutant for the flamenco locus. The sites of two new insertions have been localized by the method of subtractive hybridization.

Here, we describe the isolation of a desiccation-resistant mutant of Drosophila melanogaster. Mutagenesis of a desiccation sensitive line resulted in the isolation of a mutant with two-fold higher resistance. The mutant was partially dominant and mapped to the second chromosome. Mutant flies showed lower rates of water loss, and had a higher water content, but showed no change in body mass, glycogen content, hemolymph volume or water content tolerated at death from desiccation. These physiological differences are contrasted to changes in lines of D. melanogaster mass selected for altered stress resistance.

DNA rearrangement causes multiple changes in gene expression at the amylase locus in Drosophila melanogaster,2468332,10.1007/BF02395521,"A spontaneous null mutation at the alpha-amylase locus in Drosophila melanogaster was recovered from a laboratory population. The mutant strain was found to lack amylase enzyme production and to produce low, but detectable, levels of amylase mRNA. Moreover, the null strain is also lacking the glucose repression of amylase mRNA production which is seen in wild-type strains. The mutant phenotype correlates with a rearrangement in genomic DNA which, in turn, corresponds to a simple inversion in the arrangement observed most frequently in North American populations of D. melanogaster, including the common laboratory strain, Oregon-R. These results have implications for our understanding of both the evolution of the duplicated amylase gene structure and the regulation of amylase gene expression.",1988,"D A Hickey, B F Benkel, S Abukashawa, S Haus"

Nuclease S1 mapping of total RNA and a nuclear ;run-on' assay reveal that there is no defined point of termination throughout the whole spacer separating the two genes. Since the rRNA genes in D. melanogaster are organized in tandem arrays, this implies that readthrough transcription of one unit can occur up to, and possibly through, the promoter of the next unit.

The heat shock consensus sequence is not sufficient for hsp70 gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster,3920509,10.1128/mcb.5.1.197,"A hybrid gene in which the expression of an Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene was placed under the control of a Drosophila melanogaster 70,000-dalton heat shock protein (hsp70) gene promoter was constructed.

Mutants with 5' nontranscribed sequences of at least 90 and up to 1,140 base pairs were expressed strongly in both cell types. Mutants with shorter 5' extensions (of at least 63 base pairs) were transcribed and translated efficiently in COS-1 but not at all in D. melanogaster cells. Thus, in contrast to the situation in COS-1 cells, the previously defined heat shock consensus sequence which is located between nucleotides 62 and 48 of the hsp70 gene 5' nontranscribed DNA segment is not sufficient for the expression of the D. melanogaster gene in homologous cells.

Previous studies show that a combination of Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and TGFbeta/BMP2,4 Decapentaplegic (DPP) signaling determines appendage fate in D. melanogaster. Broad-Complex expression integrates EGFR and DPP signaling and predicts future appendage position.

Quantitative genome-wide enhancer activity maps for five Drosophila species show functional enhancer conservation and turnover during cis-regulatory evolution,24908250,10.1038/ng.3009,"Phenotypic differences between closely related species are thought to arise primarily from changes in gene expression due to mutations in cis-regulatory sequences (enhancers).

Here we use STARR-seq, a recently developed quantitative enhancer assay, to determine genome-wide enhancer activity profiles for five Drosophila species in the constant trans-regulatory environment of Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. We find that the functions of a large fraction of D. melanogaster enhancers are conserved for their orthologous sequences owing to selection and stabilizing turnover of transcription factor motifs. Moreover, hundreds of enhancers have been gained since the D. melanogaster-Drosophila yakuba split about 11 million years ago without apparent adaptive selection and can contribute to changes in gene expression in vivo.

Drosophila melanogaster as a model host for the study of microbial pathogenicity and the discovery of novel antimicrobial compounds,21470115,10.2174/138161211795703744,"The past few decades have seen alarming rates of antimicrobial drug resistance. This trend paralleled a lack of conventional methods of discovery of antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action. Although use of mammalian models remains indispensable for preclinical testing of new antimicrobial compounds, combating emerging multidrug-resistant microbial pathogens may require the use of robust, high-throughput experimental systems that can accelerate drug development. The recent discovery of striking similarities in innate immune signaling pathways between Drosophila melanogaster and mammals has led to a surge in the use of this minihost as an alternative model in studying a variety of infectious diseases. Several genetic screens for microbial pathogenicity in Drosophila identified virulence traits shown to be important for infection in mammals that may serve as targets for future drug development. In addition, conventional antimicrobial agents retain full activity in D. melanogaster infection models, which may pave the way for use of this minihost for high-throughput antimicrobial drug screening. Finally, the availability of genetic tools that allow for conditional inactivation of almost every gene in D. melanogaster is anticipated to result in the discovery of novel immunomodulatory mechanisms of action of newly identified antimicrobial compounds. Overall, the powerful genetics of and capacity for large-scale screening in D. melanogaster make this minihost a promising complementary model that may result in a new paradigm in antimicrobial drug discovery.

Population genomics of the Wolbachia endosymbiont in Drosophila melanogaster,23284297,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003129,"Wolbachia are maternally inherited symbiotic bacteria, commonly found in arthropods, which are able to manipulate the reproduction of their host in order to maximise their transmission. The evolutionary history of endosymbionts like Wolbachia can be revealed by integrating information on infection status in natural populations with patterns of sequence variation in Wolbachia and host mitochondrial genomes. Here we use whole-genome resequencing data from 290 lines of Drosophila melanogaster from North America, Europe, and Africa to predict Wolbachia infection status, estimate relative cytoplasmic genome copy number, and reconstruct Wolbachia and mitochondrial genome sequences. Overall, 63% of Drosophila strains were predicted to be infected with Wolbachia by our in silico analysis pipeline, which shows 99% concordance with infection status determined by diagnostic PCR. Complete Wolbachia and mitochondrial genomes show congruent phylogenies, consistent with strict vertical transmission through the maternal cytoplasm and imperfect transmission of Wolbachia. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis reveals that the most recent common ancestor of all Wolbachia and mitochondrial genomes in D. melanogaster dates to around 8,000 years ago. We find evidence for a recent global replacement of ancestral Wolbachia and mtDNA lineages, but our data suggest that the derived wMel lineage arose several thousand years ago, not in the 20th century as previously proposed. Our data also provide evidence that this global replacement event is incomplete and is likely to be one of several similar incomplete replacement events that have occurred since the out-of-Africa migration that allowed D. melanogaster to colonize worldwide habitats.

Protease gene duplication and proteolytic activity in Drosophila female reproductive tracts,19546158,10.1093/molbev/msp121,"Secreted proteases play integral roles in sexual reproduction in a broad range of taxa. In the genetic model Drosophila melanogaster, these molecules are thought to process peptides and activate enzymes inside female reproductive tracts, mediating critical postmating responses. A recent study of female reproductive tract proteins in the cactophilic fruit fly Drosophila arizonae, identified pervasive, lineage-specific gene duplication amongst secreted proteases. Here, we compare the evolutionary dynamics, biochemical nature, and physiological significance of secreted female reproductive serine endoproteases between D. arizonae and its congener D. melanogaster. We show that D. arizonae lower female reproductive tract (LFRT) proteins are significantly enriched for recently duplicated secreted proteases, particularly serine endoproteases, relative to D. melanogaster. Isolated lumen from D. arizonae LFRTs, furthermore, exhibits significant trypsin-like and elastase-like serine endoprotease activity, whereas no such activity is seen in D. melanogaster. Finally, trypsin- and elastase-like activity in D. arizonae female reproductive tracts is negatively regulated by mating. We propose that the intense proteolytic environment of the D. arizonae female reproductive tract relates to the extraordinary reproductive physiology of this species and that ongoing gene duplication amongst these proteases is an evolutionary consequence of sexual conflict.",2009,"Erin S Kelleher, James E Pennington"
Soma-dependent modulations contribute to divergence of rhomboid expression during evolution of Drosophila eggshell morphology,17360774,10.1242/dev.001578,"Patterning of the respiratory dorsal appendages (DAs) on the Drosophila melanogaster eggshell is tightly regulated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Variation in the DA number is observed among Drosophila species; D. melanogaster has two DAs and D. virilis has four. Diversification in the expression pattern of rhomboid (rho), which activates EGFR signaling in somatic follicle cells, could cause the evolutionary divergence of DA numbers. Here we identified a cis-regulatory element of D. virilis rho. A comparison with D. melanogaster rho enhancer and activity studies in homologous and heterologous species suggested that these rho enhancers did not functionally diverge significantly during the evolution of these species. Experiments using chimeric eggs composed of a D. virilis oocyte and D. melanogaster follicle cells showed the evolution of DA number was not attributable to germline Gurken (Grk) signaling, but to divergence in events downstream of Grk signaling affecting the rho enhancer activity in somatic follicle cells. We found that a transcription factor, Mirror, which activates rho, could be one of these downstream factors. Thus, evolution of the trans-regulatory environment that controls rho expression in somatic follicle cells could be a major contributor to the evolutionary changes in DA number.",2007,"Yukio Nakamura, Tatsuo Kagesawa, Minori Nishikawa, Yoshiki Hayashi, Satoru Kobayashi, Teruyuki Niimi, Kenji Matsuno"

The barrier preventing genetic analysis of hybrid inviability and sterility has been taken away by the discovery of a D. simulans strain which produces fertile female hybrids. D. simulans genes in the cytological locations of 21A1 to 22C1-23B1 and 30F3-31C5 to 36A2-7 have been introgressed into the D. melanogaster genetic background by consecutive backcrosses. Flies heterozygous for the introgression are fertile, while homozygotes are sterile both in females and males. The genes responsible for the sterility have been mapped in the introgression. The male sterility is caused by the synergistic effect of multiple genes, while the female sterility genes have been localized to a 170 kb region (32D2 to 32E4) containing 20 open reading frames. Thus, the female sterility might be attributed to a single gene with a large effect. We have also found that the Lethal hybrid rescue mutation which prevents the inviability of male hybrids from the cross of D. melanogaster females and D. simulans males cannot rescue those carrying the introgression, suggesting that D. simulans genes maybe non-functional in this hybrid genotype.

The nutritional compositions of the standard and field diets were analyzed, and discussed in relation to the phenotypic observations. Results showed marked differences in phenotype of flies from the two types of diets. Flies reared on the field diet are more starvation resistant and they are smaller, leaner, and have lower heat resistance compared to flies reared on the standard diet. Sex specific effects of diet type are observed for several of the investigated traits and the strong sexual dimorphism usually observed in desiccation resistance in D. melanogaster disappeared when rearing the flies on the field diet.

Genetic variation among Drosophila melanogaster isofemale lines influences encapsulation ability of the parasitoid Asobara tabida,23697011,10.12816/0006362,"One of the most important factors which affect the outcome of the host-parasite interactions is the genetic variation in particular those of the host. The aim of this study was to test the effect of variation within Drosophila melanogaster population on the encapsulation ability against the parasitoid Asobara tabida. To this end, nine isofemale lines of D. melanogaster which represent different levels of encapsulation ability were used. The encapsulation ability and its related parameters such as infestation, avoidance, and parasitism success and super-parasitism rates were assessed following oviposition. Larval weight, protein contents and phenoloxidase in extremes and intermediate lines, were investigated. The variation among D. melanogaster lines influenced encapsulation, avoidance, parasitism and superparasitism rates. Upon emergence, low success of the parasitoid associated with high mortality rates were observed in the representative lines. Although parasitized larvae may suffer from weight loss, they could survive based on mounting effective immune response. Parasitism of A. tabida in the Drosophila larvae induced high phenoloxidsae activity, particularily in the resistant ones refelecting their immune competency. In sum, the variation in encapsulation ability among isofemale lines demonstrates high underlying genetic variation. The data might help to design successful biological control programs and to facilitate interpretation of a similar interaction of other host-parasite model systems.",2013,Wesam S Meshrif
Trehalose as an indicator of desiccation stress in Drosophila melanogaster larvae: a potential marker of anhydrobiosis,22387478,10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.02.065,"In the current scenario of global climate change, desiccation is considered as one of the major environmental stressors for the biota exposed to altered levels of ambient temperature and humidity. Drosophila melanogaster, a cosmopolitan terrestrial insect has been chosen as a humidity-sensitive bioindicator model for the present study since its habitat undergoes frequent stochastic and/or seasonally aggravated dehydration regimes. We report here for the first time the occurrence of anhydrobiosis in D. melanogaster larvae by subjecting them to desiccation stress under laboratory conditions. Larvae desiccated for ten hours at <5% relative humidity could enter anhydrobiosis and could revive upon rehydration followed by resumption of active metabolism. As revealed by FTIR and HPLC analyzes, our findings strongly indicated the synthesis and accumulation of trehalose in the desiccating larvae. Biochemical measurements pointed out the desiccation-responsive trehalose metabolic pathway that was found to be coordinated in concert with the enzymes trehalose 6-phosphate synthase and trehalase. Further, an inhibitor-based experimental approach using deoxynojirimycin, a specific trehalase inhibitor, demonstrated the pivotal role of trehalose in larval anhydrobiosis of D. melanogaster. We therefore propose trehalose as a potential marker for the assessment of anhydrobiosis in Drosophila. The present findings thus add to the growing list of novel biochemical markers in specific bioindicator organisms for fulfilling the urgent need of environmental biomonitoring of climate change.",2012,"Leena J Thorat, Sushama M Gaikwad, Bimalendu B Nath"
"Friend, foe or food? Recognition and the role of antimicrobial peptides in gut immunity and Drosophila-microbe interactions",27160597,10.1098/rstb.2015.0295,"Drosophila melanogaster lives, breeds and feeds on fermenting fruit, an environment that supports a high density, and often a diversity, of microorganisms. This association with such dense microbe-rich environments has been proposed as a reason that D. melanogaster evolved a diverse and potent antimicrobial peptide (AMP) response to microorganisms, especially to combat potential pathogens that might occupy this niche. Yet, like most animals, D. melanogaster also lives in close association with the beneficial microbes that comprise its microbiota, or microbiome, and recent studies have shown that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) of the epithelial immune response play an important role in dictating these interactions and controlling the host response to gut microbiota. Moreover, D. melanogaster also eats microbes for food, consuming fermentative microbes of decaying plant material and their by-products as both larvae and adults. The processes of nutrient acquisition and host defence are remarkably similar and use shared functions for microbe detection and response, an observation that has led to the proposal that the digestive and immune systems have a common evolutionary origin. In this manner, D. melanogaster provides a powerful model to understand how, and whether, hosts differentiate between the microbes they encounter across this spectrum of associations.This article is part of the themed issue 'Evolutionary ecology of arthropod antimicrobial peptides'.",2016,Nichole A Broderick
The rosy region of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans. I. Contrasting levels of naturally occurring DNA restriction map variation and divergence,2900794,,"A 40-kb region around the rosy and snake loci was analyzed for restriction map variation among 60 lines of Drosophila melanogaster and 30 lines of Drosophila simulans collected together at a single locality in Raleigh, North Carolina. DNA sequence variation in D. simulans was estimated to be 6.3 times greater than in D. melanogaster (heterozygosities per nucleotide of 1.9% vs. 0.3%). This result stands in marked contrast to results of studies of phenotypic variation including proteins (allozymes), morphology and chromosome arrangements which are generally less variable and less geographically differentiated in D. simulans. Intraspecific polymorphism is not distributed uniformly over the 40-kb region. The level of heterozygosity per nucleotide varies more than 12-fold across the region in D. simulans, being highest over the hsc2 gene. Similar, though less extreme, variation in heterozygosity is also observed in D. melanogaster. Average interspecific divergence (corrected for intraspecific polymorphism) averaged 3.8%. The pattern of interspecific divergence over the 40-kb region shows some disparities with the spatial distribution of intraspecific variation, but is generally consistent with selective neutrality predictions: the most polymorphic regions within species are generally the most divergent between species. Sequence-length polymorphism is observed for D. melanogaster to be at levels comparable to other gene regions in this species. In contrast, no sequence length variation was observed among D. simulans chromosomes (limit of resolution approximately 100 bp). These data indicate that transposable elements play at best a minor role in the generation of naturally occurring genetic variation in D. simulans compared to D. melanogaster. We hypothesize that differences in species effective population size are the major determinant of the contrasting levels and patterns of DNA sequence and insertion/deletion variation that we report here and the patterns of allozyme and morphological variation and differentiation reported by other workers for these two species.",1988,"C F Aquadro, K M Lado, W A Noon"

In D. simulans, molecular polymorphism at the X-linked vermilion locus suggests that different groups of populations have been geographically isolated for some time. Invading populations are probably derived from different areas in Africa. European populations originate from an east African population that was probably not at a demographic equilibrium. The origin of the Antilles population is apparently different and is as yet unknown.

Identification and characterization of the Cecropin antibacterial protein gene locus in Drosophila virilis,9060393,10.1007/pl00006144,"Cecropin is a type of antibacterial peptide that is synthesized in response to infection and has been characterized in many insect species and one mammal. The Cecropin locus of Drosophila melanogaster also contains the gene Andropin, which has been identified only in this species and encodes a male-specific antibacterial peptide. As a first step in studying the molecular evolution of the cecropin and andropin genes among Drosophila species, we have isolated genomic clones that cover the Cecropin locus in Drosophila virilis. The cloned region totals approximately 25 kb, within which a 9-kb fragment contains four cecropin genes and one pseudogene. All four genes have a high level of sequence homology to D. melanogaster Cecropin, about 80% identity in the coding regions, and the intron positions are conserved. As in D. melanogaster and other insects, kappa B-related cis-regulatory elements are found upstream of these cecropin genes. An Andropin-related sequence was not identified in D. virilis; however, genome Southern hybridizations suggest that Andropin-related sequences are present in at least the melanogaster species subgroup. Analysis of 19 insect cecropin genes identifies a common ancestral Cecropin before the divergence of Diptera and Lepidoptera. In addition, D. melanogaster and D. virilis can be identified by monophyletic clades for Cecropin.

A method for extracting period~10 modulations from DNA sequence correlations applied to the Drosophila melanogaster genome,23007978,10.4238/2012.August.24.8,"Nucleosome DNA packaging and positioning within the Drosophila melanogaster genome imposes a weak modulation, with a period of about 10 bp in the genomic composition correlations. We present formalism for extracting such modulations from an irreducible set of six correlation functions calculated along the D. melanogaster genome. These modulations were seen to be stronger for the irreducible self-correlation C(zz)(k) (strong-weak binding). Using an FFT procedure, we show that the period~10 modulation extracted from such self-correlation is viewed to be an oscillation with period~10.9 overmodulated by an oscillation with period~153. This behavior of the modulation reflects the organization of the eukaryotic genomic DNA. But, since the period~10 modulation dies for k ~150, the constraints imposed by the nucleosome arrangement over the nucleosome sequence composition must be weak, provided that such constraints are the sources for the modulations.",2012,"J C O Guerra, P Licinio"

Genes involved in receptivity were located in chromosome III whereas those affecting sexual isolation were located in all the three chromosomes.

This is consistent with population genetics theory, whereby the effectiveness of selection on multiple targets is limited by stochastic effects caused by linkage. However, because the selectively preferred codons in D. melanogaster end in C or G, it has been argued that base-composition-biasing effects of recombination can account for the observed relationship between preferred codon usage and recombination rate (Marais et al., 2003). Here, we show that the correlation between base composition (of protein-coding and intron regions) and recombination rate holds only for lower values of the latter. This is consistent with a Hill-Robertson interference model and does not support a model whereby the entire effect of recombination on codon usage can be attributed to its potential role in generating compositional bias.",2003,"Richard M Kliman, Jody Hey"

The phenomenon was first observed in interspecific crosses between D. melanogaster females and males of its closest relatives which normally produce unisexual female hybrid progeny. Whereas hybrid sons from these crosses die as third instar larvae, the presence of the particular X balancers in the mother allows a low percentage of sons to survive. Similar sterile males are also observed among non-hybrid flies.

We found that, in both strains of D. melanogaster and in both sexes, a decrease in rearing temperature increases the size of the wings, legs and eyes through an effect on epidermal cell size, with no significant change in cell number.

The Nopp140 gene in Drosophila melanogaster displays length polymorphisms in its large repetitive second exon,31006039,10.1007/s00438-019-01568-6,"Nopp140, often called the nucleolar and Cajal body phosphoprotein (NOLC1), is an evolutionarily conserved chaperone for the transcription and processing of rRNA during ribosome subunit assembly. Metazoan Nopp140 contains an amino terminal LisH dimerization domain and a highly conserved carboxyl domain. A large central domain consists of alternating basic and acidic motifs of low sequence complexity. Orthologous versions of Nopp140 contain variable numbers of repeating basic-acidic units. While vertebrate Nopp140 genes use multiple exons to encode the central domain, the Nopp140 gene in Drosophila uses exclusively exon 2 to encode the central domain. Here, we define three overlapping repeat sequence patterns (P, P', and P″) within the central domain of D. melanogaster Nopp140. These repeat patterns are poorly conserved in other Drosophila species. We also describe a length polymorphism in exon 2 that pertains specifically to the P' pattern in D. melanogaster. The pattern displays either two or three 96 base pair repeats, respectively, referred to as Nopp140-Short and Nopp140-Long. Fly lines homozygous for one or the other allele, or heterozygous for both alleles, show no discernible phenotypes. PCR characterization of the long and short alleles shows a poorly defined, artifactual bias toward amplifying the long allele over the short allele.

The results of in vitro metabolism assays indicate the presence of a phenobarbital-inducible P-450 in adult D. melanogaster which is capable of metabolizing alkaloids. P-450 quantification data suggest that the enhanced level of metabolism is not the result of an overall increase in total P-450 content.

The distribution of vineyard populations of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans during vintage and non-vintage periods,28308614,10.1007/BF00345225,"Field studies inside and outside the cellars of the ""Chateau Tahbilk"" vineyard have substantiated the distribution data of original collections. D. melanogaster is found inside and outside the cellars while D. simulans is only collected outside. The presence of alcohol fumes in the outside environment during vintage alters the distribution of the species, relative to non-vintage periods, with D. melanogaster being closer to the source. Mark-release-recapture experiments suggest that movement by the species towards and away from an alcohol associated resource could explain this result. That is, the behavioural patterns of the species are differentially affected by the presence of alcohol in the environment.The distribution of the sexes of D. melanogaster may depend on their relative physiological tolerance to the presence of alcohol in the environment. The excess of females in the cellar and close to the fermentation area during vintage is due to the increased mortality of males in these areas. The reason for the distribution of the sexes of D. simulans during vintage, when an excess of females is found farthest from the fermentation area, remains speculative, but may involve behavioural mechanisms.",1974,J A McKenzie
Limitations in the use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model host for gram-positive bacterial infection,17257264,10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.02040.x,"Aims:
      
    

    
      To examine sensitivities of various Drosophila melanogaster strains towards human pathogenic and nonpathogenic gram-positive bacteria.
    

    
  


        Methods and results:
      
    

    
      The D. melanogaster Oregon R strain was infected by injecting the thorax with a needle containing Escherichia coli (negative control), Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus (both food-borne pathogens), Listeria innocua, Bacillus subtilis, Carnobacterium maltaromaticum, Lactobacillus plantarum or Pediococcus acidilactici (all nonpathogenic bacteria). Listeria monocytogenes and S. aureus killed the host rapidly compared with the negative control. Infection with L. innocua, B. subtilis or C. maltaromaticum also resulted in a high fly mortality, whereas Lact. plantarum and P. acidilactici resulted in a slightly increased mortality. Four additional D. melanogaster lines, three of which had been selected for heat, cold and desiccation resistance respectively, were subjected to infection by L. monocytogenes, S. aureus and E. coli. Mortality rates were comparable with that of the Oregon R strain.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Use of the injection method shows the limitation of D. melanogaster as a model host for gram-positive bacteria as opportunistic infection by nonpathogenic gram-positive bacteria results in partial or high mortality. In addition, lines of fruit flies resistant to various stress exposures did not show an increased resistance to infection by gram-positive pathogens under the conditions tested.

Evolutionary responses of Drosophila melanogaster under chronic malnutrition,31286000,10.3389/fevo.2018.00047,"Drosophila species have successfully spread and adapted to diverse climates across the globe. For D. melanogaster, rotting vegetative matter provides the primary substrate for mating and oviposition, and also acts as a nutritional resource for developing larvae and adult flies. The transitory nature of decaying vegetation exposes D. melanogaster to rapidly changing nutrient availability. As evidenced by their successful global spread, flies are capable of dealing with fluctuating nutritional reserves within their respective ecological niches. Therefore, D. melanogaster populations might contain standing genetic variation to support survival during periods of nutrient scarcity. The natural history and genetic tractability of D. melanogaster make the fly an ideal model for studies on the genetic basis of resistance to nutritional stress. We review artificial selection studies on nutritionally-deprived D. melanogaster and summarize the phenotypic outcomes of selected animals. Many of the reported evolved traits phenocopy mutants of the nutrient-sensing PI3K/Akt pathway. Given that the PI3K/Akt pathway is also responsive to acute nutritional stress, the PI3K/Akt pathway might underlie traits evolved under chronic nutritional deprivation. Future studies that directly test for the genetic mechanisms driving evolutionary responses to nutritional stress will take advantage of the ease in manipulating fly nutrient availability in the laboratory.",2018,"Muhammad Ahmad, Erin S Keebaugh, Muhammad Tariq, William W Ja"
Polymorphism and divergence at a Drosophila pseudogene locus,9286680,,"The larval cuticle protein (Lcp) cluster in Drosophila melanogaster contains four functional genes and a closely related pseudogene. A 630-bp fragment including the larval cuticle pseudogene locus (Lcp psi) was nucleotide sequenced in 10 strains of D. melanogaster and a 458-bp Lcp psi fragment from D. simulans was also sequenced. We used these data to test the hypotheses that the rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution are equal, that the absolute levels of variation are higher than in functional genes, and that intraspecific polymorphism is correlated with interspecific divergence. As predicted, synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates were equivalent, and overall nucleotide divergence between D. melanogaster and D. simulans (Jukes-Cantor distance = 0.149 +/- 0.150) was extremely high. However, within-species DNA sequence comparisons at Lcp psi revealed lower levels of polymorphism (theta = 0.001 +/- 0.001) than at many functional loci in D. melanogaster. Using the HUDSON, KREITMAN, and AGUADE (HKA) test, we show that the level of polymorphism in Lcp psi within D. melanogaster is lower than expected given the amount of divergence between D. melanogaster and D. simulans when the pseudogene data are compared to the Adh 5' flanking region. Because the Lcp psi lies in a region of relatively infrequent recombination, we suggest that the low level of within-species polymorphism is the result of background selection.",1997,"J K Pritchard, S W Schaeffer"

Most probes gave a unique hybridization signal; consequently, our results allow unambiguous inferences about chromosomal homologies.

A diverse set of RNA viruses belonging to several families (Rhabdoviridae, Dicistroviridae, Birnaviridae, Reoviridae, Errantiviridae) has been reported in D. melanogaster. By contrast, no DNA virus has been recovered up to now. The drosophila viruses represent powerful tools to study virus-cell interactions in vivo. Analysis of the literature however reveals that for many of them, important gaps exist in our understanding of their replication cycle, genome organization, morphology or pathogenesis. The data obtained in the past few years on antiviral defense mechanisms in drosophila, which point to evolutionary conserved pathways, highlight the potential of the D. melanogaster model to study antiviral innate immunity and to better understand the complex interaction between arthropod-borne viruses and their insect vectors.",2008,"Tünde Huszar, Jean-Luc Imler"
Genomic deletions of the Drosophila melanogaster Hsp70 genes,15579699,10.1534/genetics.104.030874,"Homologous recombination can produce directed mutations in the genomes of a number of model organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster. One of the most useful applications has been to delete target genes to generate null alleles. In Drosophila, specific gene deletions have not yet been produced by this method. To test whether such deletions could be produced by homologous recombination in D. melanogaster we set out to delete the Hsp70 genes. Six nearly identical copies of this gene, encoding the major heat-shock protein in Drosophila, are found at two separate but closely linked loci. This arrangement has thwarted standard genetic approaches to generate an Hsp70-null fly, making this an ideal test of gene targeting. In this study, ends-out targeting was used to generate specific deletions of all Hsp70 genes, including one deletion that spanned approximately 47 kb. The Hsp70-null flies are viable and fertile. The results show that genomic deletions of varied sizes can be readily generated by homologous recombination in Drosophila.",2004,"Wei J Gong, Kent G Golic"
"Amyrel, a paralogous gene of the amylase gene family in Drosophila melanogaster and the Sophophora subgenus",9618501,10.1073/pnas.95.12.6848,"We describe a gene from Drosophila melanogaster related to the alpha-amylase gene Amy. This gene, which exists as a single copy, was named Amyrel. It is strikingly divergent from Amy because the amino acid divergence is 40%. The coding sequence is interrupted by a short intron at position 655, which is unusual in amylase genes. Amyrel has also been cloned in Drosophila ananassae, Drosophila pseudoobscura, and Drosophila subobscura and is likely to be present throughout the Sophophora subgenus, but, to our knowledge, it has not been detected outside. Unexpectedly, there is a strong conservation of 5' and 3' flanking regions between Amyrel genes from different species, which is not the case for Amy and which suggests that selection acts on these regions. In contrast to the Amy genes, Amyrel is transcribed in larvae of D. melanogaster but not in adults. However, the protein has not been detected yet. Amyrel evolves about twice as fast as Amy in the several species studied. We suggest that this gene could result from a duplication of Amy followed by accelerated and selected divergence toward a new adaptation.",1998,"J L Da Lage, E Renard, F Chartois, F Lemeunier, M L Cariou"
DNA sequence comparison of micropia transposable elements from Drosophila hydei and Drosophila melanogaster,2162752,10.1007/BF01735326,"Members of the retrotransposon family micropia were discovered as constituents of wild-type Y chromosomal fertility genes from Drosophila hydei. Several members of the micropia family have subsequently been recovered from Drosophila melanogaster and four micropia elements, micropia-DhMiF2, -DhMiF8, -Dm11 and -Dm2, two each from D. hydei and D. melanogaster, have been totally sequenced (17 kb of micropia sequences and 6.8 kb from insertions). Comparative analysis of micropia sequences revealed a complex pattern of divergence within a single Drosophila genome. The divergence includes deletions, possibly by a slipped mispairing mechanism, insertions of a retroposon, and of another retrotransposon (copia) and ""positional nucleotide shuffling"" within the tandem repeats of the 3' non-protein-coding region of micropia elements. A 10 bp long sequence of each repeat unit of the 3' tandem repeats of micropia elements is highly conserved and is therefore a candidate of functional importance either in transposition events or in regulatory activity on flanking DNA sequences.",1990,"D H Lankenau, P Huijser, E Jansen, K Miedema, W Hennig"
B Chromosomes in the Drosophila Genus,30262780,10.3390/genes9100470,"Our current knowledge of B chromosome biology has been augmented by an increase in the number and diversity of species observed to carry B chromosomes as well as the use of next-generation sequencing for B chromosome genomic analysis. Within the genus Drosophila, B chromosomes have been observed in a handful of species, but recently they were discovered in a single laboratory stock of Drosophila melanogaster. In this paper, we review the B chromosomes that have been identified within the Drosophila genus and pay special attention to those recently found in D. melanogaster. These newly-discovered B chromosomes have centromeres, telomeres, and a number of simple satellite repeats. They also appear to be entirely heterochromatic since next-generation sequencing of isolated B chromosomes did not detect sequences associated with known genic regions. We also summarize what effects the B chromosomes have been found to have on the A chromosomes. Lastly, we highlight some of the outstanding questions regarding B chromosome biology and discuss how studying B chromosomes in Drosophila melanogaster, which is a versatile model system with a wealth of genetic and genomic tools, may advance our understanding of the B chromosome's unique biology.",2018,"Stacey L Hanlon, R Scott Hawley"
Neural and non-neural contributions to sexual dimorphism of mid-day sleep in Drosophila melanogaster: a pilot study,27840547,10.1111/phen.12134,"Many of the characteristics associated with mammalian sleep are also observed in Drosophila melanogaster Meigen, making the fruit fly a powerful model organism for studying the genetics of this important process. Included among the similarities is the presence of sexual dimorphic sleep patterns, which, in flies, are manifested as increased mid-day sleep ('siesta') in males compared with females. In the present study, targeted mis-expression of the genes transformer (tra) and tra2 is used to either feminize or masculinize specific neural and non-neural tissues in the fly. Feminization of male D. melanogaster using three different GAL4 drivers that are expressed in the mushroom bodies induces a female-like reduced siesta, whereas the masculinization of females using these drivers triggers the male-like increased siesta. A similar reversal of sex-specific sleep is also observed by mis-expressing tra in the fat body, which is a key tissue in energy metabolism and hormone secretion. In addition, the daily expression levels of takeout, an important circadian clock output gene, are sexually dimorphic. Taken together, these experiments suggest that sleep sexual dimorphism in D. melanogaster is driven by multiple neural and non-neural circuits, within and outside the brain.",2016,"Mobina Khericha, Jaison B Kolenchery, Eran Tauber"
The influence of Adh function on ethanol preference and tolerance in adult Drosophila melanogaster,20739429,10.1093/chemse/bjq084,"Preference determines behavioral choices such as choosing among food sources and mates. One preference-affecting chemical is ethanol, which guides insects to fermenting fruits or leaves. Here, we show that adult Drosophila melanogaster prefer food containing up to 5% ethanol over food without ethanol and avoid food with high levels (23%) of ethanol. Although female and male flies behaved differently at ethanol-containing food sources, there was no sexual dimorphism in the preference for food containing modest ethanol levels. We also investigated whether Drosophila preference, sensitivity and tolerance to ethanol was related to the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh), the primary ethanol-metabolizing enzyme in D. melanogaster. Impaired Adh function reduced ethanol preference in both D. melanogaster and a related species, D. sechellia. Adh-impaired flies also displayed reduced aversion to high ethanol concentrations, increased sensitivity to the effects of ethanol on postural control, and negative tolerance/sensitization (i.e., a reduction of the increased resistance to ethanol's effects that normally occurs upon repeated exposure). These data strongly indicate a linkage between ethanol-induced behavior and ethanol metabolism in adult fruit flies: Adh deficiency resulted in reduced preference to low ethanol concentrations and reduced aversion to high ones, despite recovery from ethanol being strongly impaired.",2010,"Maite Ogueta, Osman Cibik, Rouven Eltrop, Andrea Schneider, Henrike Scholz"
The role of Peroxin 7 during Drosophila embryonic development,32191843,10.1139/gen-2019-0207,"Peroxisomes are organelles in eukaryotic cells responsible for processing several types of lipids and management of reactive oxygen species. A conserved family of peroxisome biogenesis (Peroxin, Pex) genes encode proteins essential to peroxisome biogenesis or function. In yeast and mammals, PEROXIN7 (PEX7) acts as a cytosolic receptor protein that targets enzymes containing a peroxisome targeting signal 2 (PTS2) motif for peroxisome matrix import. The PTS2 motif is not present in the Drosophila melanogaster homologs of these enzymes. However, the fly genome contains a Pex7 gene (CG6486) that is very similar to yeast and human PEX7. We find that Pex7 is expressed in tissue-specific patterns analogous to differentiating neuroblasts in D. melanogaster embryos. This is correlated with a requirement for Pex7 in this cell lineage as targeted somatic Pex7 knockout in embryonic neuroblasts reduced survival. We also found that Pex7 over-expression in the same cell lineages caused lethality during the larval stage. Targeted somatic over-expression of a Pex7 transgene in neuroblasts of Pex7 homozygous null mutants resulted in a semi-lethal phenotype similar to targeted Pex7 knockout. These findings suggest that D. melanogaster has tissue-specific requirements for Pex7 during embryo development.",2020,"C Pridie, Andrew J Simmonds"
Neuropeptide Mapping of Dimmed Cells of Adult Drosophila Brain,29372551,10.1007/s13361-017-1870-1,"Neuropeptides are structurally highly diverse messenger molecules that act as regulators of many physiological processes such as development, metabolism, reproduction or behavior in general. Differentiation of neuropeptidergic cells often corresponds with the presence of the transcription factor DIMMED. In the central nervous system of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, DIMMED commonly occurs in neuroendocrine neurons that release peptides as neurohormones but also in interneurons with complex branching patterns. Fly strains with green fluorescence protein (GFP)-expressing dimmed cells make it possible to systematically analyze the processed neuropeptides in these cells. In this study, we mapped individual GFP-expressing neurons of adult D. melanogaster from the dimmed (c929)>GFP line. Using single cell mass spectrometry, we analyzed 10 types of dimmed neurons from the brain/gnathal ganglion. These cells included neuroendocrine cells with projection into the retrocerebral complex but also a number of large interneurons. Resulting mass spectra not only provided comprehensive data regarding mature products from 13 neuropeptide precursors but also evidence for the cellular co-localization of neuropeptides from different neuropeptide genes. The results can be implemented in a neuroanatomical map of the D. melanogaster brain. Graphical Abstract ᅟ.",2018,"Max Diesner, Reinhard Predel, Susanne Neupert"
Transvection-based gene regulation in Drosophila is a complex and plastic trait,25213691,10.1534/g3.114.012484,"Transvection, a chromosome pairing-dependent form of trans-based gene regulation, is potentially widespread in the Drosophila melanogaster genome and varies across cell types and within tissues in D. melanogaster, characteristics of a complex trait. Here, we demonstrate that the trans-interactions at the Malic enzyme (Men) locus are, in fact, transvection as classically defined and are plastic with respect to both genetic background and environment. Using chromosomal inversions, we show that trans-interactions at the Men locus are eliminated by changes in chromosomal architecture that presumably disrupt somatic pairing. We further show that the magnitude of transvection at the Men locus is modified by both genetic background and environment (temperature), demonstrating that transvection is a plastic phenotype. Our results suggest that transvection effects in D. melanogaster are shaped by a dynamic interplay between environment and genetic background. Interestingly, we find that cis-based regulation of the Men gene is more robust to genetic background and environment than trans-based. Finally, we begin to uncover the nonlocal factors that may contribute to variation in transvection overall, implicating Abd-B in the regulation of Men in cis and in trans in an allele-specific and tissue-specific manner, driven by differences in expression of the two genes across genetic backgrounds and environmental conditions.",2014,"Xinyang Bing, Teresa Z Rzezniczak, Jack R Bateman, Thomas J S Merritt"
Cyclic presence and absence of conspecifics alters circadian clock phase but does not entrain the locomotor activity rhythm of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,21797778,10.3109/07420528.2011.591018,"Circadian clocks use a wide range of environmental cues, including cycles of light, temperature, food, and social interactions, to fine-tune rhythms in behavior and physiology. Although social cues have been shown to influence circadian clocks of a variety of organisms including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, their mechanism of action is still unclear. Here, the authors report the results of their study aimed at investigating if daily cycles of presence and absence (PA) of conspecific male visitors are able to entrain the circadian locomotor activity rhythm of male hosts living under constant darkness (DD). The results suggest that PA cycles may not be able to entrain circadian locomotor activity rhythms of Drosophila. The outcome does not change when male hosts are presented with female visitors, suggesting that PA cycles of either sex may not be effective in bringing about stable entrainment of circadian clocks in D. melanogaster. However, in hosts whose clock phase has already been set by light/dark (LD) cycles, daily PA cycles of visitors can cause measurable change in the phase of subsequent free-running rhythms, provided that their circadian clocks are labile. Thus, the findings of this study suggest that D. melanogaster males may not be using cyclic social cues as their primary zeitgeber (time cue) for entrainment of circadian clocks, although social cues are capable of altering the phase of their circadian rhythms.",2011,"Shahnaz Rahman Lone, Madhumala K Sadanandappa, Vijay Kumar Sharma"
The small heat shock protein Hsp22 of Drosophila melanogaster is a mitochondrial protein displaying oligomeric organization,10896659,10.1074/jbc.M002960200,"Drosophila melanogaster has four main small heat shock proteins (Hsps), D. melanogaster Hsp22 (DmHsp22), Hsp23 (DmHsp23), Hsp26 (DmHsp26), and Hsp27 (DmHsp27). These proteins, although they have high sequence homology, show distinct developmental expression patterns. The function(s) of each small heat shock protein is unknown. DmHsp22 is shown to localize in mitochondria both in D. melanogaster S2 cells and after heterologous expression in mammalian cells. Fractionation of mitochondria indicates that DmHsp22 resides in the mitochondrial matrix, where it is found in oligomeric complexes, as shown by sedimentation and gel filtration analysis and by cross-linking experiments. Deletion analysis using a DmHsp22-EGFP construct reveals that residues 1-17 and an unknown number of residues between 17-28 are necessary for import. Site-directed mutagenesis within a putative mitochondrial motif (WRMAEE) at positions 8-13 shows that the first four residues are necessary for mitochondrial localization. Immunoprecipitation results indicate that there is no interaction between DmHsp22 and the other small heat shock proteins. The mitochondrial localization of this small Hsp22 of Drosophila and its high level of expression in aging suggests a role for this small heat shock protein in protection against oxidative stress.",2000,"G Morrow, Y Inaguma, K Kato, R M Tanguay"

Comparison between D. lebanonensis and D. melanogaster structures showed that there is almost no amino-acid change near the substrate or coenzyme binding sites and that the hydrophobic active site cavity is strictly conserved. Nevertheless, substitutions are not distributed at random in nonconstricted positions, or located in external loops, but they appear clustered mainly in secondary structure elements. From comparisons between D. melanogaster allozymes and with D. simulans, a very closely related species, a model based on changes in the electrostatic potential distribution is presented to explain their differential behavior.

The pogo transposable element family of Drosophila melanogaster,1313144,10.1007/BF00299145,"A 190 bp insertion is associated with the white-eosin mutation in Drosophila melanogaster. This insertion is a member of a family of transposable elements, pogo elements, which is of the same class as the P and hobo elements of D. melanogaster. Strains typically have many copies of a 190 bp element, 10-15 elements 1.1-1.5 kb in size and several copies of a 2.1 kb element. The smaller elements all appear to be derived from the largest by single internal deletions so that all elements share terminal sequences. They either always insert at the dinucleotide TA and have perfect 21 bp terminal inverse repeats, or have 22 bp inverse repeats and produce no duplication upon insertion. Analysis by DNA blotting of their distribution and occupancy of insertion sites in different strains suggests that they may be less mobile than P or hobo. The DNA sequence of the largest element has two long open reading frames on one strand which are joined by splicing as indicated by cDNA analysis. RNAs of this strand are made, whose sizes are similar to the major size classes of elements. A protein predicted by the DNA sequence has significant homology with a human centrosomal-associated protein, CENP-B.

Underreplicated regions in Drosophila melanogaster are enriched with fast-evolving genes and highly conserved noncoding sequences,25062918,10.1093/gbe/evu156,"Many late replicating regions are underreplicated in polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster. These regions contain silenced chromatin and overlap long syntenic blocks of conserved gene order in drosophilids. In this report we show that in D. melanogaster the underreplicated regions are enriched with fast-evolving genes lacking homologs in distant species such as mosquito or human, indicating that the phylogenetic conservation of genes correlates with replication timing and chromatin status. Drosophila genes without human homologs located in the underreplicated regions have higher nonsynonymous substitution rate and tend to encode shorter proteins when compared with those in the adjacent regions. At the same time, the underreplicated regions are enriched with ultraconserved elements and highly conserved noncoding sequences, especially in introns of very long genes indicating the presence of an extensive regulatory network that may be responsible for the conservation of gene order in these regions. The regions have a modest preference for long noncoding RNAs but are depleted for small nucleolar RNAs, microRNAs, and transfer RNAs.

There were significant correlations of the values of the balanced ratio (7T- 7P)/(7T + 7P) with geo-climatic parameters, such as latitude, longitude, mean temperature, temperature range and vapour pressure. Parallel variations were also reported for the homologous linear alkanes (23 and 25 Carbon atoms) but not for the longer branched alkanes (27 and 29 Carbon atoms).

The developmental genetics of hybrid inviability: a mitotic defect in Drosophila hybrids,9093855,,"We report studies of the developmental basis of hybrid inviability in the Drosophila melanogaster complex. The pathology of these hybrids closely resembles that of mitotic mutants in D. melanogaster. We use mosaic and cytological analyses to show that hybrid male inviability is associated with, and probably caused by, a defect in mitotic cell division. In the mosaic study, we find that male clones produced in otherwise female hybrids are not cell lethal but are very small, probably reflecting defects in mitotic proliferation. Cytological inspection of larval neuroblasts reveals a profound mitotic defect in hybrids: chromosomes show a near-complete failure to condense even after 2 hr of incubation in colchicine. Both the defect in clonal proliferation and in chromatin condensation are rescued by mutations known to rescue normally inviable hybrid males. We present a simple model in which hybrid inviability is partly or entirely caused by a mitotic defect; this defect is, in turn, caused by an interaction between the Hybrid male rescue (Hmr) locus of D. melanogaster and autosomal gene(s) from D. melanogaster's sister species.",1997,"H A Orr, L D Madden, J A Coyne, R Goodwin, R S Hawley"

In this paper, we report the results of our study on the physiological consequences of circadian dysfunction (malfunctioning of circadian clocks) in two wild-type populations of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). We assayed locomotor activity behavior and lifespan among adult flies kept under constant dark (DD) conditions of the laboratory, wherein they were categorized as rhythmic if their activity/rest schedules followed circadian (approximately 24 h) patterns, and as arrhythmic if their activity/rest schedules did not display any pattern. The rhythmic flies from both populations lived significantly longer than the arrhythmic ones.

Positive selection at the binding sites of the male-specific lethal complex involved in dosage compensation in Drosophila,18780755,10.1534/genetics.107.084244,"In many taxa, males and females differ with respect to their sex chromosomes, and dosage compensation mechanisms have evolved to equalize X-linked gene transcription. In Drosophila, the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex binds to hundreds of sites along the male X chromosome and mediates twofold hypertranscription of the single male X. Two recent studies found evidence for lineage-specific adaptive evolution in all five core protein-coding genes of the MSL complex in Drosophila melanogaster. In particular, dramatic positive selection was detected in domains shown to be responsible for their specific targeting to the X chromosome. Here I use population genetics to show that three previously characterized MSL-binding DNA segments on the X themselves underwent adaptive evolution in D. melanogaster, but not in its close relatives D. simulans and D. yakuba. MSL components have been shown to not correctly target the D. melanogaster X chromosome in hybrids between D. melanogaster and D. simulans. My finding supports the idea of selection-driven coevolution among DNA-protein interactions of the dosage compensation machinery and suggests that misregulated dosage compensation could contribute to male hybrid inviability in Drosophila.",2008,Doris Bachtrog
Transposon telomeres are widely distributed in the Drosophila genus: TART elements in the virilis group,12626755,10.1073/pnas.0230353100,"Telomeres of most animals, plants, and unicellular eukaryotes are made up of tandem arrays of repeated DNA sequences produced by the enzyme telomerase. Drosophila melanogaster has an unusual variation on this theme; telomeres consist of tandem arrays of sequences produced by successive transpositions of two non-LTR retrotransposons, HeT-A and TART. To explore the phylogenetic distribution of these variant telomeres, we have looked for TART homologues in a distantly related Drosophila species, virilis. We have found elements that, despite many differences in nucleotide sequence, retain significant amino acid similarity to TART from D. melanogaster. These D. virilis TART elements have features that characterize TART elements in D. melanogaster: (i) they are found in tandem arrays on chromosome ends, (ii) they are not found in euchromatin, and (iii) they produce both sense and antisense transcripts, with the antisense RNA being in excess. The D. virilis TART elements have one surprising feature: both of the ORFs contain long stretches of the trinucleotide repeat CAX, encoding polyglutamine (with a few interspersed histidines). These long polyglutamine stretches are conserved in the three D. virilis elements sequenced. They do not interrupt any domains of known function in the TART proteins and are not seen in TART proteins from other species.

Maximum likelihood estimation of ancestral codon usage bias parameters in Drosophila,17041152,10.1093/molbev/msl146,"We present a likelihood method for estimating codon usage bias parameters along the lineages of a phylogeny. The method is an extension of the classical codon-based models used for estimating dN/dS ratios along the lineages of a phylogeny. However, we add one extra parameter for each lineage: the selection coefficient for optimal codon usage (S), allowing joint maximum likelihood estimation of S and the dN/dS ratio. We apply the method to previously published data from Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila simulans, and Drosophila yakuba and show, in accordance with previous results, that the D. melanogaster lineage has experienced a reduction in the selection for optimal codon usage. However, the D. melanogaster lineage has also experienced a change in the biological mutation rates relative to D. simulans, in particular, a relative reduction in the mutation rate from A to G and an increase in the mutation rate from C to T. However, neither a reduction in the strength of selection nor a change in the mutational pattern can alone explain all of the data observed in the D. melanogaster lineage. For example, we also confirm previous results showing that the Notch locus has experienced positive selection for previously classified unpreferred mutations.",2007,"Rasmus Nielsen, Vanessa L Bauer DuMont, Melissa J Hubisz, Charles F Aquadro"
Variation in piRNA and transposable element content in strains of Drosophila melanogaster,25267446,10.1093/gbe/evu217,"Transposable elements (TEs) are one of the most important features of genome architecture, so their evolution and relationship with host defense mechanisms have been topics of intense study, especially in model systems such as Drosophila melanogaster.

To investigate the relationship between piRNA and TE content between strains of a species, we sequenced piRNAs from 16 inbred lines of D. melanogaster from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel. Instead of a global correlation of piRNA expression and TE content, we found evidence for a host response through de novo piRNA production from novel TE insertions. Although approximately 20% of novel TE insertions induced de novo piRNA production, the abundance of de novo piRNAs was low and did not markedly affect the global pool of ovarian piRNAs.

DNA Motifs Are Not General Predictors of Recombination in Two Drosophila Sister Species,30980655,10.1093/gbe/evz082,"Meiotic recombination is crucial for chromosomal segregation and facilitates the spread of beneficial and removal of deleterious mutations. Recombination rates frequently vary along chromosomes and Drosophila melanogaster exhibits a remarkable pattern. Recombination rates gradually decrease toward centromeres and telomeres, with a dramatic impact on levels of variation in natural populations. Two close sister species, Drosophila simulans and Drosophila mauritiana do not only have higher recombination rates but also exhibit a much more homogeneous recombination rate that only drops sharply very close to centromeres and telomeres. Because certain sequence motifs are associated with recombination rate variation in D. melanogaster, we tested whether the difference in recombination landscape between D. melanogaster and D. simulans can be explained by the genomic distribution of recombination rate-associated sequence motifs. We constructed the first high-resolution recombination map for D. simulans based on 189 haplotypes from a natural D. simulans population and searched for short sequence motifs linked with higher than average recombination in both sister species. We identified five consensus motifs significantly associated with higher than average chromosome-wide recombination rates in at least one species and present in both. Testing fine resolution associations between motif density and recombination, we found strong and positive associations genome-wide over a range of scales in D. melanogaster, while the results were equivocal in D. simulans. Despite the strong association in D. melanogaster, we did not find a decreasing density of these short-repeat motifs toward centromeres and telomeres. We conclude that the density of recombination-associated repeat motifs cannot explain the large-scale recombination landscape in D. melanogaster, nor the differences to D. simulans. The strong association seen for the sequence motifs in D. melanogaster likely reflects their impact influencing local differences in recombination rates along the genome.",2019,"James M Howie, Rupert Mazzucco, Thomas Taus, Viola Nolte, Christian Schlötterer"
Mating patterns of different Adh genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster. I. Differences in mating ability,3152054,10.1007/BF00055641,"The mating ability of the different Adh genotypes of D. melanogaster, from three natural populations, was estimated as the number of females inseminated by a single male in a 24-hour period. The data indicate that populations of D. melanogaster vary in mating properties, but a common tendency was found in all of them: the heterozygous individuals, especially the males, show a relative advantage with respect to homozygotes. On the other hand, our results suggest that the differences in mating patterns observed between populations may be correlated with the different degree of Adh polymorphism found in them.",1988,"J A Sánchez Prado, G Blanco Lizana"
Retention of Ejaculate by Drosophila melanogaster Females Requires the Male-Derived Mating Plug Protein PEBme,26058847,10.1534/genetics.115.176669,"Within the mated reproductive tracts of females of many taxa, seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) coagulate into a structure known as the mating plug (MP). MPs have diverse roles, including preventing female remating, altering female receptivity postmating, and being necessary for mated females to successfully store sperm. The Drosophila melanogaster MP, which is maintained in the mated female for several hours postmating, is comprised of a posterior MP (PMP) that forms quickly after mating begins and an anterior MP (AMP) that forms later. The PMP is composed of seminal proteins from the ejaculatory bulb (EB) of the male reproductive tract. To examine the role of the PMP protein PEBme in D. melanogaster reproduction, we identified an EB GAL4 driver and used it to target PEBme for RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown. PEBme knockdown in males compromised PMP coagulation in their mates and resulted in a significant reduction in female fertility, adversely affecting postmating uterine conformation, sperm storage, mating refractoriness, egg laying, and progeny generation. These defects resulted from the inability of females to retain the ejaculate in their reproductive tracts after mating. The uncoagulated MP impaired uncoupling by the knockdown male, and when he ultimately uncoupled, the ejaculate was often pulled out of the female. Thus, PEBme and MP coagulation are required for optimal fertility in D. melanogaster. Given the importance of the PMP for fertility, we identified additional MP proteins by mass spectrometry and found fertility functions for two of them. Our results highlight the importance of the MP and the proteins that comprise it in reproduction and suggest that in Drosophila the PMP is required to retain the ejaculate within the female reproductive tract, ensuring the storage of sperm by mated females.",2015,"Frank W Avila, Allie B Cohen, Fatima S Ameerudeen, David Duneau, Shruthi Suresh, Alexandra L Mattei, Mariana F Wolfner"
Genetics and the environment in interspecific competition: a study using the sibling species Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,28307735,10.1007/BF00333216,"The outcome of interspecific competition of two closely related species may depend upon genetic variation in the two species and the environment in which the experiment is carried out. Interspecific competition in the two sibling species, Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans, is usually investigated using longterm laboratory stocks that often have mutant markers that distinguish them. To examine competition in flies that genetically more closely resemble flies in nature, we utilized freshly caught wildtype isofemale lines of the two species collected at the same site in San Carlos, Mexico. Under ordinary laboratory conditions, D. melanogaster always won in competition. However, in hotter and drier conditions, D. simulans competed much more effectively. In these environmental conditions, there were genetic differences in competitive ability among lines with the outcome of competition primarily dependent upon the line of D. melanogaster used but in some cases also influenced by the line of D. simulans used. Differences in the measures of productivity and developmental time did not explain the differences in competitive ability among lines. This suggests that the outcome of competition was not due to differences in major fitness components among the isofemale lines but to some other attribute(s) that influenced competitive ability. When lines of flies were combined, the outcome of competition was generally consistent with competitive outcomes between pairs of lines. In several cases, the combination of lines performed better than the best of the constituent lines, suggesting that competitive ability was combined heterotically and that the total amount of genetic variation was important in the outcome of interspecific competition.",1996,"Philip W Hedrick, Elizabeth King"
High rates of phasing errors in highly polymorphic species with low levels of linkage disequilibrium,26929272,10.1111/1755-0998.12516,"Short read sequencing of diploid individuals does not permit the direct inference of the sequence on each of the two homologous chromosomes. Although various phasing software packages exist, they were primarily tailored for and tested on human data, which differ from other species in factors that influence phasing, such as SNP density, amounts of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and sample sizes. Despite becoming increasingly popular for other species, the reliability of phasing in non-human data has not been evaluated to a sufficient extent. We scrutinized the phasing accuracy for Drosophila melanogaster, a species with high polymorphism levels and reduced LD relative to humans. We phased two D. melanogaster populations and compared the results to the known haplotypes. The performance increased with size of the reference panel and was highest when the reference panel and phased individuals were from the same population. Full genomic SNP data and inclusion of sequence read information also improved phasing. Despite humans and Drosophila having similar switch error rates between polymorphic sites, the distances between switch errors were much shorter in Drosophila with only fragments <300-1500 bp being correctly phased with ≥95% confidence. This suggests that the higher SNP density cannot compensate for the higher recombination rate in D. melanogaster. Furthermore, we show that populations that have gone through demographic events such as bottlenecks can be phased with higher accuracy. Our results highlight that statistically phased data are particularly error prone in species with large population sizes or populations lacking suitable reference panels.",2016,"Marek Bukowicki, Susanne U Franssen, Christian Schlötterer"
"Behavioral analyses of mutants for two odorant-binding protein genes, Obp57d and Obp57e, in Drosophila melanogaster",18670137,10.1266/ggs.83.257,"The odorant-binding protein (OBP) functions in chemosensation in insects. Two OBP genes, Obp57d and Obp57e, are involved in the evolution of the unique host-plant preference in Drosophila sechellia. Comparative analysis of the Obp57d/e genomic sequences in the Drosophila melanogaster species group has revealed that the rapid evolution of Obp57d and Obp57e has resulted in functional divergence between the two genes. Here, using D. melanogaster knockout strains generated by gene targeting, we examined the roles of Obp57d and Obp57e in behavioral response to a series of fatty acids. In the taste-based oviposition-site preference assay, the knockout flies showed stronger preference for acids than wild-type flies, indicating that the normal functions of Obp57d and Obp57e are associated with the suppression of positive preference for C6-C9 acids. Heterozygotes for each knockout haplotype also exhibited a significantly different behavioral response compared with wild-type flies, suggesting that Obp57d and Obp57e have a gene dosage effect on behavior. In contrast, the wild-type and knockout flies exhibited similar responses in the feeding assay and the odor-based free-walking assay, suggesting that the two OBPs' contribution to feeding and olfactory behaviors is small. Taken together, our results demonstrated that each of Obp57d and Obp57e in D. melanogaster contributes to the determination of reproductive sites, suggesting that the two OBP genes play an important role in ecological adaptation of Drosophila.",2008,"Eriko Harada, Daisuke Haba, Toshiro Aigaki, Takashi Matsuo"
Introduction of the transposable element mariner into the germline of Drosophila melanogaster,1649067,,"A chimeric white gene (wpch) and other constructs containing the transposable element mariner from Drosophila mauritiana were introduced into the germline of Drosophila melanogaster using transformation mediated by the P element. In the absence of other mariner elements, the wpch allele is genetically stable in both germ cells and somatic cells, indicating that the peach element (i.e., the particular copy of mariner inserted in the wpch allele) is inactive. However, in the presence of the active element Mos1, the wpch allele reverts, owing to excision of the peach element, yielding eye-color mosaics and a high rate of germline reversion. In strains containing Mos1 virtually every fly is an eye-color mosaic, and the rate of wpch germline reversion ranges from 10 to 25%, depending on temperature. The overall rates of mariner excision and transposition are approximately sixfold greater than the rates in comparable strains of Drosophila simulans. The activity of the Mos1 element is markedly affected by position effects at the site of Mos1 insertion. In low level mosiac lines, dosage effects of Mos1 are apparent in the heavier level of eye-color mosaicism in Mos1 homozygotes than in heterozygotes. However, saturation occurs in high level mosaic lines, and then dosage effects are not observed. A pBluescribe M13+ plasmid containing Mos1 was injected into the pole plasm of D. melanogaster embryos, and the Mos1 element spontaneously integrated into the germline at high efficiency. These transformed strains of D. melanogaster presently contain numerous copies of mariner and may be useful in transposon tagging and other applications.",1991,"D Garza, M Medhora, A Koga, D L Hartl"
stress sensitive B encodes an adenine nucleotide translocase in Drosophila melanogaster,10511565,,"Adenine nucleotide translocases (ANT) are required for the exchange of ADP and ATP across the inner mitochondrial membrane.

Immediately adjacent to this gene is another encoding a second ANT protein, which has 78% identity to that encoded by sesB/l(1)9Ed. These two genes are transcribed from a common promoter, and their mRNAs are produced by differential splicing.

D. melanogaster was polymorphic for 65% of its protein loci and an individual was heterozygous for 10% of its loci. The respective figures for D pseudoobscura were 61% and 11%. These estimates of genic variation fall between previously published estimates obtained for these species by one-dimensional electrophoresis of soluble enzymes and those obtained by two-dimensional electrophoresis of solubilized abundant proteins. However, variation for both species could be strongly partitioned between loci, on the basis of tissue and stage expression of the proteins. The results are discussed with respect to their bearing on the possibility that abundant proteins constitute a distinct class of proteins less polymorphic than soluble enzymes.",1982,"R S Singh, M B Coulthart"

Here we provide a fundamental characterization of a putative lysozyme and serine carboxypeptidase from the host-induced transcriptome of Heterorhabditis bacteriophora. Both factors accelerated the mortality rate following Drosophila melanogaster infections with Photorhabdus luminescens, and both factors suppressed phenoloxidase activity in D. melanogaster hemolymph. Furthermore, the serine carboxypeptidase was lethal to a subpopulation of flies and suppressed the upregulation of antimicrobial peptides as well as phagocytosis. Together, our findings suggest that this serine carboxypeptidase possess both toxic and immunomodulatory properties while the lysozyme is likely to confer immunomodulatory, but not toxic effects.",2020,"Eric Kenney, Amulya Yaparla, John M Hawdon, Damien M O' Halloran, Leon Grayfer, Ioannis Eleftherianos"

In D. melanogaster there were no significant differences in AdhF frequency between the orchard and winery populations. The ethanol tolerance of wild caught D. melanogaster males paralleled the levels of ethanol in the breeding sites but Adh alleles and ethanol tolerance segregated largely independently of each other. Levels of ADH activity were positively associated with the ethanol tolerance of the different populations and with levels of ethanol in the breeding sites, but it is argued that the ethanol levels are not causative. Flies from inside the winery had higher ADH levels due mainly to greater amounts of ADH-F. The difference in activity persisted for at least one generation in the laboratory. After ten generations of laboratory culture the differences in ethanol tolerance were still present but there were no significant differences in ADH activity.",1988,"J B Gibson, A V Wilks"

We have determined that polypeptides are produced by the donor loci in the transformed flies and further show that although the molecular weight of the expressed polypeptides is similar to D. melanogaster electromorphs, the isoelectric points are not similar.

Additionally, co-transfection of D. melanogaster S2 cells with dual luciferase reporter constructs validated predictions that miR-310s bind to target binding sites in the 3' untranslated regions (3'-UTR) of both Cyp6g1 and Cyp6g2 in vitro. Findings in the current study provide empirical evidence for a link between reduced miRNA expression and an insecticidal resistance phenotype through reduced targeted post-transcriptional suppression of transcripts encoding proteins involved in xenobiotic detoxification.

Transient and permanent experience with fatty acids changes Drosophila melanogaster preference and fitness,24667657,10.1371/journal.pone.0092352,"Food and host-preference relies on genetic adaptation and sensory experience. In vertebrates, experience with food-related cues during early development can change adult preference. This is also true in holometabolous insects, which undergo a drastic nervous system remodelling during their complete metamorphosis, but remains uncertain in Drosophila melanogaster. We have conditioned D. melanogaster with oleic (C18:1) and stearic (C18:0) acids, two common dietary fatty acids, respectively preferred by larvae and adult. Wild-type individuals exposed either during a transient period of development-from embryo to adult-or more permanently-during one to ten generation cycles-were affected by such conditioning. In particular, the oviposition preference of females exposed to each fatty acid during larval development was affected without cross-effect indicating the specificity of each substance. Permanent exposure to each fatty acid also drastically changed oviposition preference as well as major fitness traits (development duration, sex-ratio, fecundity, adult lethality).

In this study, we compare patterns of codon usage and protein evolution in 22 genes (>11,000 codons) among Drosophila melanogaster and five relatives within the D. melanogaster subgroup. We assign changes to eight lineages using a maximum-likelihood approach to infer ancestral states. Uncertainty in ancestral reconstructions is taken into account, at least to some extent, by weighting reconstructions by their posterior probabilities. Four of the eight lineages show potentially genomewide departures from equilibrium synonymous codon usage; three are decreasing and one is increasing in major codon usage. Several of these departures are consistent with lineage-specific changes in selection intensity (selection coefficients scaled to effective population size) at silent sites. Intron base composition and rates and patterns of protein evolution are also heterogeneous among these lineages.

Homogeneity of common cosmopolitan inversion frequencies in Southeast Asian Drosophila melanogaster,16131716,10.1007/BF02715842,"East Asian Drosophila melanogaster are known for great variation in morphological and physiological characters among populations, variation that is believed to be maintained by genetic drift. To understand the genetic properties of Asian D. melanogaster populations, we initiated a population genetic study of chromosome inversion polymorphisms in hitherto unanalysed population samples from Southeast (SE) Asia. We generally found a high frequency of each of the four common cosmopolitan inversions in comparison to populations from Africa, Asia, and Australia. In contrast to the great phenotypic variation among Asian populations, however, we could not detect differences in inversion frequencies among populations. Furthermore, we observed neither correlations of inversion frequencies with population latitude and longitude, nor evidence for linkage disequilibrium between different inversion loci. We propose two explanations for the observed genetic homogeneity among these SE Asian D. melanogaster populations: (i) the observed pattern simply reflects the retention of ancestral polymorphisms originating from a panmictic population that was once present on a large single landmass (Sundaland), and/or is a consequence of high recent gene flow between populations; and (ii) it is caused by selective forces (e.g. balancing selection).",2005,"Sascha Glinka, Wolfgang Stephan, Aparup Das"
Evidence of susceptibility and resistance to cryptic X-linked meiotic drive in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster,16050104,,"There is mounting evidence consistent with a general role of positive selection acting on the Drosophila melanogaster X-chromosome. However, this positive selection need not necessarily arise from forces that are adaptive to the organism. Nonadaptive meiotic drive may exist on the X-chromosome and contribute to forces of selection. Females from a reference D. melanogaster line, containing the X-linked marker white, were crossed to males from 49 isofemale lines established from seven African and five non-African natural populations to detect naturally occurring meiotic drive. Several lines exhibited a departure from expected Mendelian transmission of X-chromosomes to the third generation (F2) offspring, particularly those from hybrid African male parents. F2 viability was not correlated with skewed chromosomal inheritance. However, a significant difference in viability between cosmopolitan and tropical African crosses was observed. Recombination analysis supports the presence of a male-acting meiotic drive element near the centromeric region of the X-chromosome and putative recessive autosomal drive suppression. There is also evidence of another female-acting drive element linked to white. The possible role meiotic drive may contribute in shaping levels of genetic variation in D. melanogaster, and additional ways to test this hypothesis are discussed.",2005,"Floyd A Reed, R Guy Reeves, Charles F Aquadro"

Adaptation of Circadian Neuronal Network to Photoperiod in High-Latitude European Drosophilids,28262491,10.1016/j.cub.2017.01.036,"The genus Drosophila contains over 2,000 species that, stemming from a common ancestor in the Old World Tropics, populate today very different environments [1, 2] (reviewed in [3]). We found significant differences in the activity pattern of Drosophila species belonging to the holarctic virilis group, i.e., D. ezoana and D. littoralis, collected in Northern Europe, compared to that of the cosmopolitan D. melanogaster, collected close to the equator. These behavioral differences might have been of adaptive significance for colonizing high-latitude habitats and hence adjust to long photoperiods. Most interestingly, the flies' locomotor activity correlates with the neurochemistry of their circadian clock network, which differs between low and high latitude for the expression pattern of the blue light photopigment cryptochrome (CRY) and the neuropeptide Pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) [4-6]. In D. melanogaster, CRY and PDF are known to modulate the timing of activity and to maintain robust rhythmicity under constant conditions [7-11]. We could partly simulate the rhythmic behavior of the high-latitude virilis group species by mimicking their CRY/PDF expression patterns in a laboratory strain of D. melanogaster. We therefore suggest that these alterations in the CRY/PDF clock neurochemistry might have allowed the virilis group species to colonize high-latitude environments.",2017,"Pamela Menegazzi, Elena Dalla Benetta, Marta Beauchamp, Matthias Schlichting, Ingolf Steffan-Dewenter, Charlotte Helfrich-Förster"
Canalization of segmentation and its evolution in Drosophila,17569783,10.1073/pnas.0701359104,"Segmentation in Drosophila embryogenesis occurs through a hierarchical cascade of regulatory gene expression driven by the establishment of a diffusion-mediated morphogen gradient. Here, we investigate the response of this pattern formation process to genetic variation and evolution in egg size. Specifically, we ask whether spatial localization of gap genes Kruppel (Kr) and giant (gt) and the pair-rule gene even-skipped (eve) during cellularization is robust to genetic variation in embryo length in three Drosophila melanogaster isolines and two closely related species. We identified two wild-derived strains of D. melanogaster whose eggs differ by approximately 25% in length when reared under identical conditions. These two lines, a D. melanogaster laboratory stock (w1118), and offspring from crosses between the lines all exhibit precise scaling in the placement of gap and pair-rule gene expression along the anterior-posterior axis in relation to embryo length. Genetic analysis indicates that this scaling is maternally controlled. Maternal regulation of scaling must be required for consistent localization of segmentation gene expression because embryo size, a genetically variable and adaptive trait, is maternally inherited. We also investigated spatial scaling between these D. melanogaster lines and single lines of Drosophila sechellia and Drosophila simulans, the latter two differing by approximately 25% in egg length. In contrast to the robust scaling we observed within species, localization of gene expression relative to embryo length differs significantly between the three species. Thus, the developmental mechanism that assures robust scaling within a species does not prevent rapid evolution between species.",2007,"Susan E Lott, Martin Kreitman, Arnar Palsson, Elena Alekseeva, Michael Z Ludwig"
"Inferring weak selection from patterns of polymorphism and divergence at ""silent"" sites in Drosophila DNA",7713409,,"Patterns of codon usage and ""silent"" DNA divergence suggest that natural selection discriminates among synonymous codons in Drosophila. ""Preferred"" codons are consistently found in higher frequencies within their synonymous families in Drosophila melanogaster genes. This suggests a simple model of silent DNA evolution where natural selection favors mutations from unpreferred to preferred codons (preferred changes). Changes in the opposite direction, from preferred to unpreferred synonymous codons (unpreferred changes), are selected against. Here, selection on synonymous DNA mutations is investigated by comparing the evolutionary dynamics of these two categories of silent DNA changes. Sequences from outgroups are used to determine the direction of synonymous DNA changes within and between D. melanogaster and Drosophila simulans for five genes. Population genetics theory shows that differences in the fitness effect of mutations can be inferred from the comparison of ratios of polymorphism to divergence. Unpreferred changes show a significantly higher ratio of polymorphism to divergence than preferred changes in the D. simulans lineage, confirming the action of selection at silent sites. An excess of unpreferred fixations in 28 genes suggests a relaxation of selection on synonymous mutations in D. melanogaster. Estimates of selection coefficients for synonymous mutations (3.6 < magnitude of Nes < 1.3) in D. simulans are consistent with the reduced efficacy of natural selection (magnitude of Nes < 1) in the three- to sixfold smaller effective population size of D. melanogaster. Synonymous DNA changes appear to be a prevalent class of weakly selected mutations in Drosophila.",1995,H Akashi
Luteolin-Supplemented diets ameliorates Bisphenol A-Induced toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster,32504732,10.1016/j.fct.2020.111478,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is an industrial chemical used in the production of various plastic materials. It is associated with reproductive, immunological and neurological disorders. Luteolin, a flavonoid found in fruits and vegetables, possesses anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and free radical scavenging properties. Here, we carried out studies to ascertain if Luteolin would ameliorate BPA-induced toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster. Firstly, flies were treated separately with Luteolin (0, 50, 100, 150 and 300 mg/kg diet) and BPA (0, 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 mM) for 28 days survival assessments. Consequently, Luteolin (150 and 300 mg/kg diet) and/or BPA (0.05 mM) were exposed to D. melanogaster for 7 days for the evaluation of nitric oxide level, eclosion rate, viability assay, histology of fat body, antioxidant (Glutathione-S-transferase, catalase and total thiol), oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide) and behavioural (negative geotaxis and acetylcholinesterase) markers. The results showed that BPA induced antioxidant-oxidative stress imbalance and behavioural deficit in flies. Luteolin increased survival rate and augmented antioxidant markers in flies. Importantly, Luteolin ameliorated BPA-induced degeneration in the fat body around the rostral, thorax and abdominal regions, oxidative stress, behavioural deficit, reduction in cell viability and eclosion rate of D. melanogaster (p < 0.05). Overall, this study offered further insights on the antioxidative and chemopreventive properties of Luteolin against BPA-induced toxicity.",2020,"Omolola A Adesanoye, Amos O Abolaji, Tolulope R Faloye, Hannah O Olaoye, Adeola O Adedara"
"Short-term exposure to predation affects body elemental composition, climbing speed and survival ability in Drosophila melanogaster",27602281,10.7717/peerj.2314,"Factors such as temperature, habitat, larval density, food availability and food quality substantially affect organismal development. In addition, risk of predation has a complex impact on the behavioural and morphological life history responses of prey. Responses to predation risk seem to be mediated by physiological stress, which is an adaptation for maintaining homeostasis and improving survivorship during life-threatening situations. We tested whether predator exposure during the larval phase of development has any influence on body elemental composition, energy reserves, body size, climbing speed and survival ability of adult Drosophila melanogaster. Fruit fly larvae were exposed to predation by jumping spiders (Phidippus apacheanus), and the percentage of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content, extracted lipids, escape response and survival were measured from predator-exposed and control adult flies. The results revealed predation as an important determinant of adult phenotype formation and survival ability. D. melanogaster reared together with spiders had a higher concentration of body N (but equal body C), a lower body mass and lipid reserves, a higher climbing speed and improved adult survival ability. The results suggest that the potential of predators to affect the development and the adult phenotype of D. melanogaster is high enough to use predators as a more natural stimulus in laboratory experiments when testing, for example, fruit fly memory and learning ability, or when comparing natural populations living under different predation pressures.",2016,"Indrikis Krams, Sarah Eichler Inwood, Giedrius Trakimas, Ronalds Krams, Gordon M Burghardt, David M Butler, Severi Luoto, Tatjana Krama"
Population genomic analysis uncovers African and European admixture in Drosophila melanogaster populations from the south-eastern United States and Caribbean Islands,25735402,10.1111/mec.13137,"Drosophila melanogaster is postulated to have colonized North America in the past several 100 years in two waves. Flies from Europe colonized the east coast United States while flies from Africa inhabited the Caribbean, which if true, make the south-east US and Caribbean Islands a secondary contact zone for African and European D. melanogaster. This scenario has been proposed based on phenotypes and limited genetic data. In our study, we have sequenced individual whole genomes of flies from populations in the south-east US and Caribbean Islands and examined these populations in conjunction with population sequences from the west coast US, Africa, and Europe. We find that west coast US populations are closely related to the European population, likely reflecting a rapid westward expansion upon first settlements into North America. We also find genomic evidence of African and European admixture in south-east US and Caribbean populations, with a clinal pattern of decreasing proportions of African ancestry with higher latitude. Our genomic analysis of D. melanogaster populations from the south-east US and Caribbean Islands provides more evidence for the Caribbean Islands as the source of previously reported novel African alleles found in other east coast US populations. We also find the border between the south-east US and the Caribbean island to be the admixture hot zone where distinctly African-like Caribbean flies become genomically more similar to European-like south-east US flies. Our findings have important implications for previous studies examining the generation of east coast US clines via selection.",2015,"Joyce Y Kao, Asif Zubair, Matthew P Salomon, Sergey V Nuzhdin, Daniel Campo"
The PRAT purine synthesis gene duplication in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis is associated with a retrotransposition event and diversification of expression patterns,12698299,10.1007/s00239-002-2431-0,"The Drosophila melanogaster Prat gene encodes amidophosphoribosyltransferase (PRAT; EC 2.4.2.14), which performs the first step in de novo purine nucleotide synthesis. Prat mutations have a recessive lethal phenotype that is found for other genes encoding enzymes in this pathway. The D. melanogaster genome project has revealed a second gene, CG10078 or Prat2, encoding a protein with 76% amino acid sequence identity with Prat. The two genes map to different arms of chromosome 3 and have different intron/exon organizations, as we confirmed by cDNA sequence analysis of Prat2. With the goal to determine the functional significance of this gene duplication, we isolated and sequenced two PRAT-encoding genes from Drosophila virilis. We find that the two D. virilis genes are orthologous to the two D. melanogaster genes in terms of intron/exon organization, amino acid coding sequence, and 5' noncoding sequence. The absence of introns in both DmelPrat and DvirPrat genes suggests that Prat originated from a retrotransposition of Prat2 and that the gene duplication has been preserved in the two species since their divergence approximately 40 million years ago. Analysis of mRNA expression in development shows that maternal expression, detected in adult ovaries and embryos prior to the onset of zygotic transcription, is present for Prat but not Prat2 in both species. Taken together, these findings support the notion that two PRAT-encoding genes have evolved distinct functions in both Drosophila species.",2003,"Nicolas Malmanche, Dennis Drapeau, Patrick Cafferty, Yingbiao Ji, Denise V Clark"
[THE ROLE OF sbr/Dm nxf1 GENE DURING SYNCYTIAL PERIODS OF DEVELOPMENT IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER],26349247,,"The syncytial development is a feature of early embryogenesis and spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. All elements of syncytium are interconnected by single cytoskeletal network that enables equal conditions and provides synchronic development. The cytoskeleton is essential for the formation and functioning of the mitotic spindle, cytoskeletal elements are the main structural component of cilia and flagella. Intra- and intercellular transport, morphogenesis processes depend from cytoskeleton on both within a single cell, and at the level of the whole organism. The sbr (small bristles) gene of D. melanogaster belongs to the NXF (nuclear export factor) evolutionarily conservative proteins family. Gene Dm nxf1 (sbr), as well as its orthologs in other organisms, controls the export of poly(A)-containing RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and the corresponding proteins are usually localized in the nucleus or in the nuclear envelope. For SBR protein we have shown the localization not only in the nucleus, but in the cytoplasm marking of characteristic cytoplasmic structures. A breach of the cytoskeleton in the sbr (Dm nxf1) mutant in D. melanogaster shown by us and cytoplasmic localization of the protein SBR allow us to link the specific functions of this protein with the dynamics of the cytoskeleton.",2015,"E V Golubkova, A A Atsapkina, L A Mamon"
Role of temperature in mediating morning and evening emergence chronotypes in fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster,25411239,10.1177/0748730414553797,"Following decades of research under controlled laboratory conditions, there has been growing interest in the recent past to study circadian rhythms in nature. Recent studies conducted under natural conditions have been fruitful in exploring several characteristics of circadian rhythms that remained cryptic and previously masked under standard laboratory conditions, reemphasizing that the complexity of circadian rhythms in nature increases multifold under the influence of multiple zeitgebers. However, our understanding of the contributions of different zeitgebers in shaping various rhythm characteristics still remains elusive. Previously, Vaze et al. reported that chronotype differences between the morning emerging (early) and evening emerging (late) populations of Drosophila melanogaster are considerably enhanced under natural conditions compared to standard laboratory conditions. In the present study, we assess the role of 2 primary zeitgebers in nature-light and temperature-individually and in unison in driving chronotype differences. We report that when provided independently, temperature cycles enhance divergence between the early and late chronotypes more strongly than light, but when together, light and temperature appear to act antagonistically and that appropriate phase difference between light and temperature cycles is essential to promote chronotype divergence. Thus, our study highlights the importance of light and temperature, as well as their interaction with circadian clocks in mediating early and late chronotypes in fruit flies D. melanogaster.",2014,"K L Nikhil, Gupta Goirik, Karatgi Ratna, Vijay Kumar Sharma"
A model of segmental duplication formation in Drosophila melanogaster,17726166,10.1101/gr.6208307,"Segmental duplications (SDs) are low-copy repeats of DNA segments that have long been recognized to be involved in genome organization and evolution. But, to date, the mechanism of their formation remains obscure. We propose a model for SD formation that we name ""duplication-dependent strand annealing"" (DDSA). This model is a variant of the synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) model--a double-strand break (DSB) homologous repair model. DSB repair in Drosophila melanogaster genome usually occurs primarily through homologous repair, more preferentially through the SDSA model. The DDSA model predicts that after a DSB, the search for an ectopic homologous region--here a repeat--initiates the repair. As expected by the model, the analysis of SDs detected by a computational analysis of the D. melanogaster genome indicates a high enrichment in transposable elements at SD ends. It shows moreover a preferential location of SDs in heterochromatic regions. The model has the advantage of also predicting specific traces left during synthesis. The observed traces support the DDSA model as one model of formation of SDs in D. melanogaster genome. The analysis of these DDSA signatures suggests moreover a sequestration of the dissociated strand in the repair complex.",2007,"Anna-Sophie Fiston-Lavier, Dominique Anxolabehere, Hadi Quesneville"
Sexual isolation in Drosophila melanogaster: a possible case of incipient speciation,7708677,10.1073/pnas.92.7.2519,"It is generally believed that Drosophila melanogaster has no closely related species with which it can produce the viable and fertile hybrids that are essential for the genetic analysis of speciation. Following the recent report of molecular differentiation between a Zimbabwe, Africa, population and two United States populations, we provide evidence that strong sexual isolation exists between the D. melanogaster population in Zimbabwe and populations of other continents. In the presence of males of their own kind, females from most isofemale lines of Zimbabwe would not mate with males from elsewhere; the reciprocal mating is also significantly reduced, but to a lesser degree. The genes for sexual behaviors are apparently polymorphic in Zimbabwe and postmating reproductive isolation between this and other populations has not yet evolved. Whole chromosome substitutions indicate significant genetic contributions to male mating success by both major autosomes, whereas the X chromosome effect is too weak to measure. In addition, the relative mating success between hybrid and pure line males supports the interpretation of strong female choice. These observations suggest that we are seeing the early stages of speciation in this group and that it is driven by sexual selection. The genetic and molecular tractability of D. melanogaster offers great promise for the detailed analysis of this apparent case of incipient speciation.",1995,"C I Wu, H Hollocher, D J Begun, C F Aquadro, Y Xu, M L Wu"

Three enzymes of intermediary metabolism (HK, alpha-GPDH and CO) showed positive thermal compensation, which is the type of response characteristic of the enzymes involved in energy metabolism in vertebrate ectotherms. 3. The data obtained for CS and G6PDH showed no evidence for increased activity of TCA cycle nor of the pentose phosphate pathway upon cold acclimation in D. melanogaster. 4.

In the past, a number of worldwide populations of Drosophila melanogaster have been extensively studied for several such markers, including allozymes, chromosomal inversions, and quantitative characters. Here we present results from a study of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in 92 isofemale lines from many of the same geographic populations of D. melanogaster. Eleven restriction enzymes were used, of which four revealed restriction-site polymorphism. A total of 24 different haplotypes were observed, of which 18 were unique to single populations. In many populations, the unique haplotypes have reached high frequency without being observed in neighboring populations. A Wagner parsimony tree reveals that mutationally close variants show geographical clumping, suggesting local differentiation of mtDNA in populations. The Old-World and the New-World populations are differentiated, with the predominant Old-World haplotype being virtually absent from the New World.

In the case of asynapsis of polytene chromosomes in heterozygotes the label is detected in a number of intercalary heterochromatin sites in one homologous only (""the asymmetrical label""). The same kind of radioactivity distribution in intercalary heterochromatin regions was observed after a hybridization of polytene chromosomes with cloned DNA fragments (Ananiev et al.,, 1978, 1979) coding for the abundant classes of messenger RNA (Ilyin et al., 1978) in cultured D. melanogaster cells. In some regions of intercalary heterochromatin which do not contain these fragments the ""asymmetrical"" type of labelled distribution is observed after hybridization with cell RNA.

Transcription start site evolution in Drosophila,23649539,10.1093/molbev/mst085,"Transcription start site (TSS) evolution remains largely undescribed in Drosophila, likely due to limited annotations in non-melanogaster species. In this study, we introduce a concise new method that selectively sequences from the 5'-end of mRNA and used it to identify TSS in four Drosophila species, including Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. pseudoobscura. For verification, we compared our results in D. melanogaster with known annotations, published 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends data, and with RNAseq from the same mRNA pool. Then, we paired 2,849 D. melanogaster TSS with its closest equivalent TSS in each species (likely to be its true ortholog) using the available multiple sequence alignments. Most of the D. melanogaster TSSs were successfully paired with an ortholog in each species (83%, 86%, and 55% for D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. pseudoobscura, respectively). On the basis of the number and distribution of reads mapped at each TSS, we also estimated promoter-specific expression (PSE) and TSS peak shape, respectively. Among paired TSS orthologs, the location and promoter activity were largely conserved. TSS location appears important as PSE, and TSS peak shape was more frequently divergent among TSS that had moved. Unpaired TSS were surprisingly common in D. pseudoobscura. An increased mutation rate upstream of TSS might explain this pattern.

First evidence of methylation in the genome of Drosophila willistoni,17205375,10.1007/s10709-006-9116-3,"DNA methylation has been studied abundantly in vertebrates and recent evidence confirms that this phenomenon could be disseminated among some invertebrates groups, including Drosophila species. In this paper, we used the Methylation-Sensitive Restriction Endonuclease (MSRE) technique and Southern blot with specific probes, to detect methylation in the Drosophila willistoni species. We found differential cleavage patterns between males and females that cannot be explained by Mendelian inheritance, pointing to a DNA methylation phenomenon different from the Drosophila melanogaster one. The sequencing of some of these bands showed that these fragments were formed by different DNA elements, among which rDNA. We also characterized the D. willitoni dDnmt2 sequence, through a Mega Blast search against the D. willistoni Trace Archive Database using the D. melanogaster dDnmt2 nucleotide sequence as query. The complete analysis of D. willistoni dDnmt2 sequence showed that its promoter region is larger, its dDnmt2 nucleotide sequence is 33% divergent from the D. melanogaster one, Inverted Terminal Repeats (ITRs) are absent and only the B isoform of the enzyme is produced. In contrast, ORF2 is more conserved. Comparing the D. willistoni and D. melanogaster dDnmt2 protein sequences, we found higher conservation in motifs from the large domain, responsible for the catalysis of methyl transfer, and great variability in the region that carries out the recognition of specific DNA sequences (TRD). Globally, our results reveal that methylation of the D. willistoni genome could be involved in a singular process of species-specific dosage compensation and that the DNA methylation in the Drosophila genus can have diverse functions. This could be related to the evolutionary history of each species and also to the acquisition time of the dDnmt2 gene.",2007,"Rosane Nunes Garcia, Marícia Fantinel D'Avila, Lizandra Jaqueline Robe, Elgion Lúcio da Silva Loreto, Yanina Panzera, Fabiana Oliveira de Heredia, Vera Lúcia da Silva Valente"

This assay detects a wide range of mutational events, including point mutations, deletions, certain types of chromosomal aberrations (nondisjunction), and mitotic recombination. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of phenolic and anthocyanin compounds were carried out using biochemical and high-performance liquid chromatography methodologies. In addition, the antioxidant capacity of P. boldus and C. alba leaf extracts was also analyzed. P. boldus and C. alba extracts did not induce significant mutagenic effects in the D. melanogaster model. However, simultaneous treatment of extracts concurrently with the mutagen ethyl methane sulphonate showed a decrease of mutant spots in somatic cells of D. melanogaster, indicating desmutagenic effects in this in vivo model.

Nucleolar dominance of the Y chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster,22649076,10.1534/genetics.112.141242,"The rDNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase I to make structural RNAs for ribosomes. Hundreds of rDNA genes are typically arranged in an array that spans megabase pairs of DNA. These arrays are the major sites of transcription in growing cells, accounting for as much as 50% of RNA synthesis. The repetitive rDNA arrays are thought to use heterochromatic gene silencing as a mechanism for metabolic regulation, since repeated sequences nucleate heterochromatin formation in eukaryotes. Drosophila melanogaster carries an rDNA array on the X chromosome and on the Y chromosome, and genetic analysis has suggested that both are transcribed. However, using a chromatin-marking assay, we find that the entire X chromosome rDNA array is normally silenced in D. melanogaster males, while the Y chromosome rDNA array is dominant and expressed. This resembles ""nucleolar dominance,"" a phenomenon that occurs in interspecific hybrids where an rDNA array from one parental species is silenced, and that from the other parent is preferentially transcribed. Interspecies nucleolar dominance is thought to result from incompatibilities between species-specific transcription factors and the rDNA promoters in the hybrid, but our results show that nucleolar dominance is a normal feature of rDNA regulation. Nucleolar dominance within D. melanogaster is only partially dependent on known components of heterochromatic gene silencing, implying that a distinctive chromatin regulatory system may act at rDNA genes. Finally, we isolate variant Y chromosomes that allow X chromosome array expression and suggest that the large-scale organization of rDNA arrays contribute to nucleolar dominance. This is the first example of allelic inactivation in D. melanogaster.",2012,"Frauke Greil, Kami Ahmad"
Drosophila melanogaster as a model host to dissect the immunopathogenesis of zygomycosis,18583479,10.1073/pnas.0709578105,"Zygomycosis is an emerging frequently fatal opportunistic mycosis whose immunopathogenesis is poorly understood. We developed a zygomycosis model by injecting Drosophila melanogaster flies with a standardized amount of fungal spores from clinical Zygomycetes isolates to study virulence and host defense mechanisms. We found that, as opposed to most other fungi, which are nonpathogenic in D. melanogaster (e.g., Aspergillus fumigatus), Zygomycetes rapidly infect and kill wild-type flies. Toll-deficient flies exhibited increased susceptibility to Zygomycetes, whereas constitutive overexpression of the antifungal peptide Drosomycin in transgenic flies partially restored resistance to zygomycosis. D. melanogaster Schneider 2 phagocytic cells displayed decreased phagocytosis and caused less hyphal damage to Zygomycetes compared with that to A. fumigatus. Furthermore, phagocytosis-defective eater mutant flies displayed increased susceptibility to Zygomycetes infection. Classic enhancers of Zygomycetes virulence in humans, such as corticosteroids, increased iron supply, and iron availability through treatment with deferoxamine dramatically increased Zygomycetes pathogenicity in our model. In contrast, iron starvation induced by treatment with the iron chelator deferasirox significantly protected flies infected with Zygomycetes. Whole-genome expression profiling in wild-type flies after infection with Zygomycetes vs. A. fumigatus identified genes selectively down-regulated by Zygomycetes, which act in pathogen recognition, immune defense, stress response, detoxification, steroid metabolism, or tissue repair or have unknown functions.

GAL4 causes developmental defects and apoptosis when expressed in the developing eye of Drosophila melanogaster,12917801,,"The UAS/GAL4 ectopic expression system is widely used in Drosophila melanogaster for the overexpression of transgenes. This system operates under the assumption that the yeast transcription factor, GAL4, is inactive in D. melanogaster. Thus, GAL4 can be expressed under the control of D. melanogaster -specific promoters with little effect upon the organism. We have shown that expression of GAL4 in the developing eye under the control of the glass multiple reporter (GMR) promoter element does have an effect on eye development. Although GMR-GAL4 heterozygotes appear normal when raised at 25 degrees C, the homozygotes have a highly disorganized ommatidial array. In addition, the levels of apoptosis in the third-instar larval eye imaginal disc (where GAL4 is expressed) are slightly higher in GMR-GAL4 heterozygotes, and much higher in GMR-GAL4 homozygotes when compared to wild type discs. The morphological eye defects caused by GMR-GAL4 are significantly enhanced when flies are raised at 29 degrees C (presumably due to the higher activity of GAL4 at this temperature); however, the levels of apoptosis appear to be similar at these two temperatures. Taken together, these data suggest that GAL4 can have adverse effects on D. melanogaster development, especially at high expression levels. In addition, GAL4 appears to induce apoptosis even in the absence of any visible morphological defects. Thus, despite the benefits of the UAS/GAL4 ectopic expression system, one must use caution in the design and interpretation of experiments.",2003,"Jamie M Kramer, Brian E Staveley"
Genetic Architecture of Abdominal Pigmentation in Drosophila melanogaster,25933381,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005163,"Pigmentation varies within and between species and is often adaptive.

We quantified the proportion of melanization on the two most posterior abdominal segments, tergites 5 and 6 (T5, T6). We found significant genetic variation in the proportion of melanization and high broad-sense heritabilities for each tergite. Genome-wide association studies identified over 150 DNA variants associated with the proportion of melanization on T5 (84), T6 (34), and the difference between T5 and T6 (35). Several of the top variants associated with variation in pigmentation are in tan, ebony, and bric-a-brac1, genes known to affect D. melanogaster abdominal pigmentation. Mutational analyses and targeted RNAi-knockdown showed that 17 out of 28 (61%) novel candidate genes implicated by the genome-wide association study affected abdominal pigmentation. Several of these genes are involved in developmental and regulatory pathways, chitin production, cuticle structure, and vesicle formation and transport. These findings show that genetic variation may affect multiple steps in pathways involved in tergite development and melanization. Variation in these novel candidates may serve as targets for adaptive evolution and sexual selection in D. melanogaster.",2015,"Lauren M Dembeck, Wen Huang, Michael M Magwire, Faye Lawrence, Richard F Lyman, Trudy F C Mackay"
Changes in lipid classes of Drosophila melanogaster in response to selection for three stress traits,31153895,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2019.103890,"Laboratory selection on environmental stress traits is an evolutionary approach that is informative in the context of understanding stress adaptation. Here we characterize changes in a lipidome of Drosophila melanogaster in lines selected for increased heat (elevated heat knockdown refractoriness), cold (decreased time to recover from chill-coma) and desiccation survival. Selection for desiccation resistance resulted in changes in multiple lipid classes used to characterize a lipidome. This included a decrease in triacylglycerols (TAGs) which is relevant to interpretation of storage lipid levels in previous D. melanogaster desiccation survival selection experiments. Chill-coma recovery rate selection was expected to show extensive changes in lipid classes, but only phosphatidic acids exhibited significant change. Selection for increased heat knockdown resistance resulted in a substantial change in the abundance of a class of lipids (diacylglycerols) which could play a role in mediating the heat shock response or result in an increase in neutral lipid mobilization.",2019,"Li Ko, Lawrence Harshman, Sandra Hangartner, Ary Hoffmann, Steve Kachman, Paul Black"
Phenotypic rescue by a bovine transgene in a Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-null mutant of Drosophila melanogaster,8289809,10.1128/mcb.14.2.1302,"Null mutants for Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) in Drosophila melanogaster are male sterile, have a greatly reduced adult life span, and are hypersensitive to paraquat. We have introduced a synthetic bovine CuZnSOD transgene under the transcriptional control of the D. melanogaster 5C actin promoter into a CuZnSOD-null mutant of D. melanogaster. This was carried out by P-element-mediated transformation of the Drosophila-bovine CuZnSOD transgene into a CuZnSOD+ recipient strain followed by genetic crossing of the transgene into a strain carrying the CuZnSOD-null mutation, cSODn108. The resulting transformants express bovine CuZnSOD exclusively to about 30% of normal Drosophila CuZnSOD levels. Expression of the Drosophila-bovine CuZnSOD transgene in the CuZnSOD-null mutant rescues male fertility and resistance to paraquat to apparently normal levels. However, adult life span is restored to only 30% of normal, and resistance to hyperoxia is 90% of that found in control flies. This striking differential restoration of pleiotropic phenotypes could be the result of a threshhold of CuZnSOD expression necessary for normal male fertility and resistance to the toxicity of paraquat or hyperoxia which is lower than the threshold required to sustain a normal adult life span. Alternatively, the differential rescue of fertility, resistance to active oxygen, and life span might indicate different cell-specific transcriptional requirements for these functions which are normally provided by the control elements of the native CuZnSOD gene but are only partly compensated for by the transcriptional control elements of the actin 5C promoter.",1994,"I Reveillaud, J Phillips, B Duyf, A Hilliker, A Kongpachith, J E Fleming"
Copper decreases associative learning and memory in Drosophila melanogaster,31926406,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135306,"Copper is an essential element to all living organisms. Repeated use of metal-enriched chemicals, fertilizers, and organic substances may cause contamination at a large scale. Altered levels of Cu2+ may result in harmful effects and can be associated with memory and cognitive dysfunction. Studying simple, genetically tractable organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster, can reveal important data on the neural basis of conditioning. D. melanogaster is an important alternative experimental model to assess the toxic response to metals. In the present study, the effects of copper on flies' development and in learning and memory retention in male and female adult flies were investigated. We paired an odorant to pain perception and observed the aversion behavior over time. Exposure of D. melanogaster eggs to Cu2+ increased mortality of larvae, pupae, and adults and decreased memory retention in adults. Moreover, male flies demonstrated to be more susceptible to Cu2+ toxicity than females. The results therefore, reinforce the importance of controlling the anthropogenic heavy-metals soil contamination given their hazardous effects to living organisms.",2020,"D C Zamberlan, P T Halmenschelager, L F O Silva, J B T da Rocha"
Selective sweep in the Flotillin-2 region of European Drosophila melanogaster,23437190,10.1371/journal.pone.0056629,"Localizing genes that are subject to recent positive selection is a major goal of evolutionary biology. In the model organism Drosophila melanogaster many attempts have been made in recent years to identify such genes by conducting so-called genome scans of selection. These analyses consisted in typing a large number of genetic markers along the genomes of a sample of individuals and then identifying those loci that harbor patterns of genetic variation, which are compatible with the ones generated by a selective sweep. In this study we conduct an in-depth analysis of a genomic region located on the X chromosome of D. melanogaster that was identified as a potential target of recent positive selection by a previous genome scan of selection. To this end we re-sequenced 20 kilobases around the Flotillin-2 gene (Flo-2) and conducted a detailed analysis of the allele frequencies and linkage disequilibria observed in this new dataset.

The AcBacmid-GFP-DmFuca plasmid was used to transfect Tn-5B1-4 cells of the Cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed a band of about 80kDa. Using a polyclonal antiserum raised against α-l-fucosidase protein from D. melanogaster Western blotting analysis confirmed that the fusion protein eGFP-DmFuca has been successfully expressed in a biologically active form in Tn-5B1-4 cells. The recombinant protein, containing the histidine-tag motif, was purified using an affinity chromatography column.

The biochemical properties of the mitochondrial thiamine pyrophosphate carrier from Drosophila melanogaster,20121944,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07550.x,"The mitochondrial carriers are a family of transport proteins that shuttle metabolites, nucleotides and cofactors across the inner mitochondrial membrane.

In the present study, we report the functional identification of two D. melanogaster genes distantly related to the human and yeast thiamine pyrophosphate carrier (TPC) genes as well as the corresponding expression pattern throughout development. Furthermore, the functional characterization of the D. melanogaster mitochondrial thiamine pyrophosphate carrier protein (DmTpc1p) is described. DmTpc1p was over-expressed in bacteria, the purified protein was reconstituted into liposomes, and its transport properties and kinetic parameters were characterized. Reconstituted DmTpc1p transports thiamine pyrophosphate and, to a lesser extent, pyrophosphate, ADP, ATP and other nucleotides. The expression of DmTpc1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiaeTPC1 null mutant abolishes the growth defect on fermentable carbon sources.

A scan of molecular variation leads to the narrow localization of a selective sweep affecting both Afrotropical and cosmopolitan populations of Drosophila melanogaster,16322515,10.1534/genetics.105.049973,"Drosophila melanogaster originated in tropical Africa but has achieved a cosmopolitan distribution in association with human habitation. Cosmopolitan populations of D. melanogaster are known to have reduced genetic variation, particularly on the X chromosome. However, the relative importance of population bottlenecks and selective sweeps in explaining this reduction is uncertain. We surveyed variation at 31 microsatellites across a 330-kb section of the X chromosome located between the white and kirre genes. Two linked clusters of loci were observed with reduced variation and a skew toward rare alleles in both an Ecuador and a Zimbabwe population sample. Examining Zimbabwe DNA sequence polymorphism within one of these regions allowed us to localize a selective sweep to a 361-bp window within the 5' regulatory region of the roughest gene, with one nucleotide substitution representing the best candidate for the target of selection. Estimates of sweep age suggested that this fixation event occurred prior to the expansion of D. melanogaster from sub-Saharan Africa. For both putative sweep regions in our data set, cosmopolitan populations showed wider footprints of selection compared to those in Zimbabwe. This pattern appears consistent with the demographic amplification of preexisting sweep signals due to one or more population bottlenecks.",2006,"John E Pool, Vanessa Bauer DuMont, Jacob L Mueller, Charles F Aquadro"

The chamber consists of the tip of a micropipette, which allows for monitoring the field potential generated by the spontaneously contracting heart. The method can produce accurate information about the heart rate and the amplitude of the cardiac action potential. The preparation can be used for pharmacological studies on the heart of D. melanogaster since it responds, with an increase in the heart rate, to unusually low concentrations of octopamine, 1 nM, a compound with cardioaccelerating properties for insect heart. The recording system can be easily modified for experiments on the heart of other insects.

Molecular nature of 11 spontaneous de novo mutations in Drosophila melanogaster,11238412,,"To investigate the molecular nature and rate of spontaneous mutation in Drosophila melanogaster, we screened 887,000 individuals for de novo recessive loss-of-function mutations at eight loci that affect eye color. In total, 28 mutants were found in 16 independent events (13 singletons and three clusters). The molecular nature of the 13 events was analyzed. Coding exons of the locus were affected by insertions or deletions >100 nucleotides long (6 events), short frameshift insertions or deletions (4 events), and replacement nucleotide substitutions (1 event). In the case of 2 mutant alleles, coding regions were not affected. Because approximately 70% of spontaneous de novo loss-of-function mutations in Homo sapiens are due to nucleotide substitutions within coding regions, insertions and deletions appear to play a much larger role in spontaneous mutation in D. melanogaster than in H. sapiens. If so, the per nucleotide mutation rate in D. melanogaster may be lower than in H. sapiens, even if their per locus mutation rates are similar.",2001,"H P Yang, A Y Tanikawa, A S Kondrashov"
Prod is a novel DNA-binding protein that binds to the 1.686 g/cm(3) 10 bp satellite repeat of Drosophila melanogaster,10982875,10.1093/nar/28.18.3551,"The proliferation disrupter (prod) gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a novel protein associated with centromeric chromosomal regions that is required for chromatin condensation and cell viability. We have examined the binding of the Prod protein to DNA in vitro. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that Prod is a DNA-binding protein that specifically recognizes the 10 bp AGAATAACAT satellite repeat of D.melanogaster. Footprinting experiments show that the protein interacts with a 5-8 bp target sequence in each 10 bp repeat and suggest that it can mediate condensation of this satellite into a superhelix. Gel retardation experiments indicate that Prod does not have a well defined DNA-binding domain and it binds the satellite in a co-operative manner, probably forming Prod multimers. Since Prod localizes to both heterochromatin and euchromatin in vivo, we discuss the possibility that the ability of pre-existing euchromatic proteins to bind DNA in a co-operative manner, might be a prerequisite of satellite compaction and satellite amplification, thereby providing a basic factor in heterochromatin evolution.",2000,"T Török, M Gorjánácz, P J Bryant, I Kiss"
Drosophila melanogaster acylphosphatase: a common ancestor for acylphosphatase isoenzymes of vertebrate species,9744795,10.1016/s0014-5793(98)00912-0,"An open reading frame encoding a putative acylphosphatase was found in Drosophila melanogaster.

The D. melanogaster protein and a deletion mutant, similar in length to vertebrate acylphosphatases, were produced by cloning the corresponding cDNA in Escherichia coli. The wild-type enzyme is a protein with a well-established three-dimensional fold and a markedly reduced conformational stability as compared to vertebrate isoenzymes. The specific activity of the enzyme is significantly lower than that found in vertebrate enzymes though the substrate binding capability is basically unaltered. The deletion of 22 residues does not cause a significant change in k(cat), while affecting the apparent binding parameters.

Multi-locus selection and the structure of variation at the white gene of Drosophila melanogaster,8889526,,"We surveyed sequence variation and divergence for the entire 5972-bp transcriptional unit of the white gene in 15 lines of Drosophila melanogaster and one line of D. simulans. We found a very high degree of haplotypic structuring for the polymorphisms in the 3' half of the gene, as opposed to the polymorphisms in the 5' half. To determine the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for this pattern we sequenced a 1612-bp segment of the white gene from an additional 33 lines of D. melanogaster from a European and a North American population. This 1612-bp segment encompasses an 834-bp region of the white gene in which the polymorphisms form high frequency haplotypes that cannot be explained by a neutral equilibrium model of molecular evolution. The small number of recombinants in the 834-bp region suggests epistatic selection as the cause of the haplotypic structuring, while an investigation of nucleotide diversity supports a directional selection hypothesis. A multi-locus selection model that combines features from both hypotheses and takes the recent history of D. melanogaster into account may be the best explanation for these data.",1996,"D A Kirby, W Stephan"
Excess polymorphism at the Adh locus in Drosophila melanogaster,3021568,,"The evolutionary history of a region of DNA encompassing the Adh locus is studied by comparing patterns of variation in Drosophila melanogaster and its sibling species, D. simulans. An unexpectedly high level of silent polymorphism in the Adh coding region relative to the 5' and 3' flanking regions in D. melanogaster is revealed by a populational survey of restriction polymorphism using a four-cutter filter hybridization technique as well as by direct sequence comparisons. In both of these studies, a region of the Adh gene encompassing the three coding exons exhibits a frequency of polymorphism equal to that of a 4-kb 5' flanking region. In contrast, an interspecific sequence comparison shows a two-fold higher level of divergence in the 5' flanking sequence compared to the structural locus. Analysis of the patterns of variation suggest an excess of polymorphism within the D. melanogaster Adh locus, rather than lack of polymorphism in the 5' flanking region. An approach is outlined for testing neutral theory predictions about patterns of variation within and between species. This approach indicates that the observed patterns of variation are incompatible with an infinite site neutral model.",1986,"M E Kreitman, M Aguadé"
Contribution of a natural polymorphism in protein kinase G modulates electroconvulsive seizure recovery in Drosophila melanogaster,29798846,10.1242/jeb.179747,"Drosophila melanogaster is a well-characterized model for neurological disorders and is widely used for investigating causes of altered neuronal excitability leading to seizure-like behavior. One method used to analyze behavioral output of neuronal perturbance is recording the time to locomotor recovery from an electroconvulsive shock. Based on this behavior, we sought to quantify seizure susceptibility in larval D. melanogaster with differences in the enzymatic activity levels of a major protein, cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). PKG, encoded by foraging, has two natural allelic variants and has previously been implicated in several important physiological characteristics including: foraging patterns, learning and memory, and environmental stress tolerance. The well-established NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway found in the fly, which potentially targets downstream K+ channel(s), ultimately impacts membrane excitability, leading to our hypothesis: altering PKG enzymatic activity modulates time to recovery from an electroconvulsive seizure. Our results show that by both genetically and pharmacologically increasing PKG enzymatic activity, we can decrease the locomotor recovery time from an electroconvulsive seizure in larval D. melanogaster.",2018,"Stephanie P Kelly, Monica G Risley, Leonor E Miranda, Ken Dawson-Scully"

Additionally, we investigated whether flies are potential vectors of human and plant pathogens. Eighteen species of fungi and twelve species of bacteria were isolated from wild flies. The most abundant microorganisms identified were the yeast Candida inconspicua and the bacterium Klebsiella sp.

We investigated high and low temperature acclimation induced by fluctuating thermal regimes at two different mean temperatures, at two different amplitudes of fluctuation and across the developmental and adult life stages of Drosophila melanogaster For developmental acclimation, we found mildly detrimental effects of high-amplitude fluctuations for critical thermal minima, while the critical thermal maxima showed a beneficial response to higher amplitude fluctuations. For adult acclimation involving shifts between fluctuating and constant regimes, cold tolerance was shown to be dictated by developmental temperature conditions irrespective of the adult treatments, while the acquired heat tolerance was readily lost when flies developed at fluctuating temperature were shifted to a constant regime as adults. Interestingly, we also found that the effect of fluctuations at any life stage was gradually lost with prolonged adult maintenance, suggesting a more prominent effect of fluctuations during developmental compared with adult acclimation in D.melanogaster.",2017,"Paul Vinu Salachan, Jesper Givskov Sørensen"

A distinct population of approximately 25 nt WNV-homologous small RNAs was detected in infected S2 cells but not C6/36 cells.

      Larvae of D. melanogaster were exposed to 10 GHz EMF continuously (3 h, 4 h and 5 h) and discontinuously (3 h exposure + 30 min interval + 3 h exposure). The percentages and times of transition from larvae to pupae and from pupae to adults were determined, and the mean offspring number was examined using the offspring of the females which had been exposed as larvae.

Rapid divergence of gene duplicates on the Drosophila melanogaster X chromosome,12032248,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004149,"The recent sequencing of several eukaryotic genomes has generated considerable interest in the study of gene duplication events. The classical model of duplicate gene evolution is that recurrent mutation ultimately results in one copy becoming a pseudogene, and only rarely will a beneficial new function evolve. Here, we study divergence between coding sequence duplications in Drosophila melanogaster as a function of the linkage relationship between paralogs. The mean K(a)/K(s) between all duplicates in the D. melanogaster genome is 0.2803, indicating that purifying selection is maintaining the structure of duplicate coding sequences. However, the mean K(a)/K(s) between duplicates that are both on the X chromosome is 0.4701, significantly higher than the genome average. Further, the distribution of K(a)/K(s) for these X-linked duplicates is significantly shifted toward higher values when compared with the distributions for paralogs in other linkage relationships. Two models of molecular evolution provide qualitative explanations of these observations-relaxation of selective pressure on the duplicate copies and, more likely, positive selection on recessive adaptations. We also show that there is an excess of X-linked duplicates with low K(s), suggesting a larger proportion of relatively young duplicates on the D. melanogaster X chromosome relative to autosomes.",2002,"Kevin Thornton, Manyuan Long"
Why it is difficult to model sperm displacement in Drosophila melanogaster: the relation between sperm transfer and copulation duration,10937230,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00056.x,"We have investigated the effects of experimental manipulation of copulation duration on sperm displacement in Drosophila melanogaster. Both spermless and normal males were used as second (displacing) males in the experiments. Displacement induced in the absence of sperm, that is, by males that pass accessory gland fluid alone, was a relatively inefficient process and produced much lower levels of displacement than normal males. Therefore, the presence of second-male sperm is necessary (but unlikely sufficient) for the high levels of displacement commonly observed in D. melanogaster. Furthermore, when second matings were interrupted at various times after the initiation of copulation, the distribution of displacement was strongly bimodal. We conclude that sperm transfer is relatively rapid, beginning shortly after the initiation of copulation, and is essentially complete before the midpoint of copulation. Therefore, sperm transfer bears no simple relation to copulation duration. Because it would be difficult to manipulate the numbers of sperm transferred by manipulating copulation duration, methods used to study sperm displacement in other insect species are unlikely to be appropriate for D. melanogaster. We also investigated why males mate for more than twice the duration that appears to be necessary to complete sperm transfer. Experimental interruption of first matings indicated that the extra copulation time serves to delay female remating, rather than to increase that rate at which of offspring are sired before remating.",2000,"A S Gilchrist, L Partridge"
Loss of notum macrochaetae as an interspecific hybrid anomaly between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans,9649532,,"With the aim of revealing genetic variation accumulated among closely related species during the course of evolution, this study focuses on loss of macrochaetae on the notum as one of the developmental anomalies seen in interspecific hybrids between Drosophila melanogaster and its closely related species. Interspecific hybrids between a line of D. melanogaster and D. simulans isofemale lines exhibited a wide range in the number of missing bristles. By contrast, D. mauritiana and D. sechellia lines showed almost no reduction in bristle number in hybrids with D. melanogaster. Genetic analysis showed that the D. simulans X chromosome confers a large effect on hybrid bristle loss, although X-autosome interaction may be involved. This suggests that at least one genetic factor contributing to hybrid anomalies arose recently on a D. simulans X chromosome. Moreover, the results indicate sex dependency: the male hybrids were more susceptible to bristle loss than the female hybrids were. Use of cell type markers suggests that the defect does not lie in cell fate decisions during bristle development, but in the maintenance of neural fate and/or differentiation of the descendants of sensory mother cells.",1998,T S Takano

Our earlier report contrasted intraspecific polymorphism and interspecific differences at silent and replacement sites in these species. This report expands the number of European and African lines and examines the pattern of polymorphism with respect to the common A/B allozymes. In D. melanogaster the silent nucleotide diversity varies 2.8-fold across localities. The B allele sequences are two-to fourfold more variable than the derived A allele, and differences between allozymes are twice as among B alleles. There is strong linkage disequilibrium across the G6pd region. In both species the level of silent polymorphism increases from the 5' to 3' ends, while there is no comparable pattern in level of silent site divergence or fixation. The neutral model is not rejected in either species. Using D. yakuba as an outgroup, the D. melanogaster lineage shows a twofold greater rate of silent fixation, but less than half the rate of amino acid replacement.

Nucleotide sequencing of both the hamster and D. melanogaster RPO21 DNAs confirmed that the RPO21 polypeptides of these two species, like the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RPO21 polypeptide, contain both an N-terminal region homologous to the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase subunit beta' and a unique polymerase II-specific C-terminal domain. This C-terminal domain, encoded by separate exons in the D. melanogaster and hamster genes, consists of a tandemly repeated heptapeptide sequence. By constructing a series of deletions in DNA encoding the 26 heptapeptide repeats normally present in the S. cerevisiae RPO21 polypeptide, we have established that a minimum of between 9 and 11 repeats is necessary for RPO21 function in yeast cells. Replacement of the yeast RPO21 heptapeptide repeats by the longer hamster repetitive domain resulted in viable yeast cells with no detectable mutant phenotype, while a similar replacement of the yeast repeats by the more divergent D. melanogaster repeats was a recessive lethal mutation. We suggest that this novel repetitive domain is essential for proper initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II and that it may mediate the functions of TATA boxes, upstream activating sequences, and enhancers.",1988,"L A Allison, J K Wong, V D Fitzpatrick, M Moyle, C J Ingles"
Molecular evolution of X-linked accessory gland proteins in Drosophila pseudoobscura,15073226,10.1093/jhered/esh027,"In Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, positive Darwinian selection drives high rates of evolution of male reproductive genes, and accessory gland proteins (Acps) in particular. Here, we tested whether 13 X-linked male-specific genes, 4 Acps and 9 non-Acps, are under selective forces in the Drosophila pseudoobscura species group, much as those in the D. melanogaster group. We observed a statistically significant correlation in relative rates of nonsynonymous evolution between the two species groups tested. One Acp examined had a higher rate of nonsynonymous substitution than predicted by a neutral model in both species groups, suggesting its divergence was driven by positive Darwinian selection. To further test for the signature of selection, we examined polymorphism of three Acps within D. pseudoobscura. From this test, no Acp individually bore the signature of positive selection, but the 3 Acps together possessed an excess of nonsynonymous differences between species, relative to polymorphism within species. We conclude that faster evolution of Acps in the D. pseudoobscura group appears to be driven by positive selection, as previously suggested in the D. melanogaster group.",2004,"L S Stevison, B A Counterman, M A F Noor"
RNAseq Analysis of the Drosophila Response to the Entomopathogenic Nematode Steinernema,28450373,10.1534/g3.117.041004,"Drosophila melanogaster is an outstanding model to study the molecular and functional basis of host-pathogen interactions. Currently, our knowledge of microbial infections in D. melanogaster is well understood; however, the response of flies to nematode infections is still in its infancy. Here, we have used the potent parasitic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae, which lives in mutualism with its endosymbiotic bacteria Xenorhabdus nematophila, to examine the transcriptomic basis of the interaction between D. melanogaster and entomopathogenic nematodes. We have employed next-generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to investigate the transcriptomic profile of D. melanogaster larvae in response to infection by S. carpocapsae symbiotic (carrying X. nematophila) or axenic (lacking X. nematophila) nematodes. Bioinformatic analyses have identified the strong induction of genes that are associated with the peritrophic membrane and the stress response, as well as several genes that participate in developmental processes. We have also found that genes with different biological functions are enriched in D. melanogaster larvae responding to either symbiotic or axenic nematodes. We further show that while symbiotic nematode infection enriched certain known immune-related genes, axenic nematode infection enriched several genes associated with chitin binding, lipid metabolic functions, and neuroactive ligand receptors. In addition, we have identified genes with a potential role in nematode recognition and genes with potential antinematode activity. Findings from this study will undoubtedly set the stage for the identification of key regulators of antinematode immune mechanisms in D. melanogaster, as well as in other insects of socioeconomic importance.",2017,"Shruti Yadav, Sean Daugherty, Amol Carl Shetty, Ioannis Eleftherianos"
Evolutionary conservation of regulatory strategies for the sex determination factor transformer-2,9111363,10.1128/mcb.17.5.2908,"Sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster is regulated by a cascade of splicing factors which direct the sex-specific expression of gene products needed for male and female differentiation. The splicing factor TRA-2 affects sex-specific splicing of multiple pre-mRNAs involved in sexual differentiation. The tra-2 gene itself expresses a complex set of mRNAs generated through alternative processing that collectively encode three distinct protein isoforms. The expression of these isoforms differs in the soma and germ line. In the male germ line the ratio of two isoforms present is governed by autoregulation of splicing. However, the functional significance of multiple TRA-2 isoforms has remained uncertain. Here we have examined whether the structure, function, and regulation of tra-2 are conserved in Drosophila virilis, a species diverged from D. melanogaster by over 60 million years. We find that the D. virilis homolog of tra-2 produces alternatively spliced RNAs encoding a set of protein isoforms analogous to those found in D. melanogaster. When introduced into the genome of D. melanogaster, this homolog can functionally replace the endogenous tra-2 gene for both normal female sexual differentiation and spermatogenesis. Examination of alternative mRNAs produced in D. virilis testes suggests that germ line-specific autoregulation of tra-2 function is accomplished by a strategy similar to that used in D. melanogaster. The similarity in structure and function of the tra-2 genes in these divergent Drosophila species supports the idea that sexual differentiation in D. melanogaster and D. virilis is accomplished under the control of similar regulatory pathways.",1997,"D Chandler, M E McGuffin, J Piskur, J Yao, B S Baker, W Mattox"

Developmental origin of even spacing between the microchaetes of Drosophila melanogaster,822814,,"In D. melanogaster, evenness of spacing is a prominent feature of the patterns of microchaetes. As a general explanation of this characteristic, Wigglesworth has suggested a scheme whereby some epidermal cells become singled out (determined) at random to differentiate bristles, and the same potential in neighbouring cells issuppressed by the determined ones. Though this model may be satisfactory for other epidermal regions, the spacing between bristles within some of the mid-dorsal thoracic acrostichal rows is too even to be accommodated.",1976,Claxton
Conservatism of sites of tRNA loci among the linkage groups of several Drosophila species,2107332,10.1007/BF02099944,"The sites of seven tRNA genes (Arg-2, Lys-2, Ser-2b, Ser-7, Thr-3, Thr-4, Val-3b) were studied by in situ hybridization. 125I-labeled tRNA probes from Drosophila melanogaster were hybridized to spreads of polytene chromosomes prepared from four Drosophila species representing different evolutionary lineages (D. melanogaster, Drosophila hydei, Drosophila pseudoobscura, and Drosophila virilis). Most tRNA loci occurred on homologous chromosomal elements of all four species. In some cases the number of hybridization sites within an element varied and sites on nonhomologous elements were found. It was observed that both tRNA(2Arg) and tRNA(2Lys) hybridized to the same site on homologous elements in several species. These data suggest a limited amount of exchange among different linkage groups during the evolution of Drosophila species.",1990,"J Tonzetich, S Hayashi, T A Grigliatti"
Drosophila melanogaster Hsp22: a mitochondrial small heat shock protein influencing the aging process,25852752,10.3389/fgene.2015.00103,"Mitochondria are involved in many key cellular processes and therefore need to rely on good protein quality control (PQC). Three types of mechanisms are in place to insure mitochondrial protein integrity: reactive oxygen species scavenging by anti-oxidant enzymes, protein folding/degradation by molecular chaperones and proteases and clearance of defective mitochondria by mitophagy. Drosophila melanogaster Hsp22 is part of the molecular chaperone axis of the PQC and is characterized by its intra-mitochondrial localization and preferential expression during aging. As a stress biomarker, the level of its expression during aging has been shown to partially predict the remaining lifespan of flies. Since over-expression of this small heat shock protein increases lifespan and resistance to stress, Hsp22 most likely has a positive effect on mitochondrial integrity. Accordingly, Hsp22 has recently been implicated in the mitochondrial unfolding protein response of flies. This review will summarize the key findings on D. melanogaster Hsp22 and emphasis on its links with the aging process.",2015,"Geneviève Morrow, Robert M Tanguay"
Seasonal variation in life history traits in two Drosophila species,26174167,10.1111/jeb.12690,"Seasonal environmental heterogeneity is cyclic, persistent and geographically widespread. In species that reproduce multiple times annually, environmental changes across seasonal time may create different selection regimes that may shape the population ecology and life history adaptation in these species. Here, we investigate how two closely related species of Drosophila in a temperate orchard respond to environmental changes across seasonal time. Natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans were sampled at four timepoints from June through November to assess seasonal change in fundamental aspects of population dynamics as well as life history traits. D. melanogaster exhibit pronounced change across seasonal time: early in the season, the population is inferred to be uniformly young and potentially represents the early generation following overwintering survivorship. D. melanogaster isofemale lines derived from the early population and reared in a common garden are characterized by high tolerance to a variety of stressors as well as a fast rate of development in the laboratory environment that declines across seasonal time. In contrast, wild D. simulans populations were inferred to be consistently heterogeneous in age distribution across seasonal collections; only starvation tolerance changed predictably over seasonal time in a parallel manner as in D. melanogaster. These results suggest fundamental differences in population and evolutionary dynamics between these two taxa associated with seasonal heterogeneity in environmental parameters and associated selection pressures.",2015,"E L Behrman, S S Watson, K R O'Brien, M S Heschel, P S Schmidt"
What the loss of the hormone neuroparsin in the melanogaster subgroup of Drosophila can tell us about its function,20226240,10.1016/j.ibmb.2010.03.001,"The twelve sequenced Drosophila genomes show the vast majority of neurohormone and neuropeptide genes to be very well conserved. Nonetheless, the gene encoding the hormone neuroparsin has undergone significant evolution. Although Drosophila melanogaster has one of the best known genomes, no neuroparsin gene can be detected in either the assembled genome or any of the individual sequencing traces. This gene is similarly absent from the genomes of other species in the melanogaster subgroup, even though it is present in the genomes of eight other Drosophila species. Transgenes in which the promotor of the Drosophila ananassae neuroparsin gene drives expression of gal4 show no expression in D. melanogaster. The hypothesis that this gene has been lost from the melanogaster subgroup is also supported by the neuroparsin gene of Drosophila auraria. In this species, of which the genome has not been sequenced, but which stands phylogenetically between D. ananassae and D. melanogaster, the predicted neuroparsin has lost half its normal size, including four of the twelve conserved cysteine residues. These findings demonstrate that a hormone which plays important regulatory roles in development and reproduction in hemimetabola and is important in mosquito reproduction, has lost its relevance in the melanogaster subgroup of the genus Drosophila. If the essential role of neuroparsin in larval hemimetabola is to ensure the gradual progression from a larval into an adult form during development, that role might become superfluous in some holometabola. In mosquitoes the role of neuroparsin in reproduction appears similar to that of the insulin-related hormones. Perhaps the combination of the development of a complete metamorphosis and a redundant role in reproduction made neuroparsin dispensable in some Drosophila species.",2010,Jan A Veenstra

Intra- and interspecies variation among Bari-1 elements of the melanogaster species group,9725843,,"We have investigated the distribution of sequences homologous to Bari-1, a Tc1-like transposable element first identified in Drosophila melanogaster, in 87 species of the Drosophila genus. We have also isolated and sequenced Bari-1 homologues from D. simulans, D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia, the species constituting with D. melanogaster the melanogaster complex, and from D. diplacantha and D. erecta, two phylogenetically more distant species of the melanogaster group. Within the melanogaster complex the Bari-1 elements are extremely similar to each other, showing nucleotide identity values of at least 99.3%. In contrast, Bari-1-like elements from D. diplacantha and D. erecta are on average only 70% similar to D. melanogaster Bari-1 and are usually defective due to nucleotide deletions and/or insertions in the ORFs encoding their transposases. In D. erecta the defective copies are all located in the chromocenter and on chromosome 4. Surprisingly, while D. melanogaster Bari-1 elements possess 26-bp inverted terminal repeats, their D. diplacantha and D. erecta homologues possess long inverted terminal repeats similar to the terminal structures observed in the S elements of D. melanogaster and in several other Tc1-like elements of different organisms. This finding, together with the nucleotide and amino acid identity level between D. diplacantha and D. erecta elements and Bari-1 of D. melanogaster, suggests a common evolutionary origin and a rapid diversification of the termini of these Drosophila Tc1-like elements.",1998,"R Moschetti, C Caggese, P Barsanti, R Caizzi"

We have studied the influence of the dietary supplement of the polysaccharides containing a hot water extract of the mushroom L. edodes on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster in terms of food intake, body weight, life span, and age-related locomotor activity. L. edodes extract, when added to the D. melanogaster feeding substrate at a 0.003-0.030% concentration (calculated for the dry weight of the polysaccharide fraction) did not influence food intake or body weight of the flies. It increased the life span and locomotor activities of male flies but was associated with early mortality and decreased locomotor activity of female flies. We conclude that the observed anti-aging effects of L. edodes extracts in the male D. melanogaster are not the result of dietary restriction. We propose that D. melanogaster is a suitable model organism for researching the molecular basis of the anti-aging effect of the shiitake mushroom extracts and sex linkage of these effects.",2014,"Natalya Matjuskova, Elena Azena, Ksenija Serstnova, Indrikis Muiznieks"
The potential toxic effects of cerium on organism: cerium prolonged the developmental time and induced the expression of Hsp70 and apoptosis in Drosophila melanogaster,22707041,10.1007/s10646-012-0960-x,"Due to the widespread application of cerium, a rare earth element, the risk of exposure to cerium has increased. Therefore, understanding the physiological effects of cerium is of great importance. Our previous work showed that cerium caused significant lifespan shortening accompanied by oxidative damage in Drosophila melanogaster, however, little is known about the detailed mechanism of cerium-induced cytotoxicity. Thus, we examined the developmental time during metamorphosis, and assessed the toxic effects of cerium by evaluating heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), DNA damage markers and apoptosis in D. melanogaster. We found that cerium extended the developmental time of D. melanogaster and up-regulated the expression of Hsp70 when the concentration of cerium was increased (especially concentrations over 26.3 μg/g). Up-regulation of the cell cycle checkpoint p53 and cell signaling protein p38 were also observed when the concentration of cerium was over 104 μg/g. In addition, the activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9, markers of apoptosis, were significantly higher when the larvae were exposed to ceric sulfate. These results suggest that high concentrations of cerium may result in DNA damage and ultimately apoptosis in D. melanogaster, and strongly indicate that cerium should be applied with caution and the potential toxic effects in humans should also be taken into consideration.",2012,"Bin Wu, Di Zhang, Dan Wang, Chunyan Qi, Zongyun Li"

The transposable element mariner mediates germline transformation in Drosophila melanogaster,8394264,,"A vector for germline transformation in Drosophila melanogaster was constructed using the transposable element mariner. The vector, denoted pMlwB, contains a mariner element disrupted by an insertion containing the wild-type white gene from D. melanogaster, the beta-galactosidase gene from Escherichia coli and sequences that enable plasmid replication and selection in E. coli. The white gene is controlled by the promoter of the D. melanogaster gene for heat-shock protein 70, and the beta-galactosidase gene is flanked upstream by the promoter of the transposable element P as well as that of mariner. The MlwB element was introduced into the germline of D. melanogaster by co-injection into embryos with an active mariner element, Mos1, which codes for a functional transposase and serves as a helper. Two independent germline insertions were isolated and characterized. The results show that the MlwB element inserted into the genome in a mariner-dependent manner with the termini of the inverted repeats inserted at a TA dinucleotide. Both insertions exhibit an unexpected degree of germline and somatic stability, even in the presence of an active mariner element in the genetic background. These results demonstrate that the mariner transposable element, which is small (1286 bp) and relatively homogeneous in size among different copies, is nevertheless capable of promoting the insertion of the large (13.2 kb) MlwB element. Because of the widespread phylogenetic distribution of mariner among insects, these results suggest that mariner might provide a wide host-range transformation vector for insects.",1993,"D A Lidholm, A R Lohe, D L Hartl"

The Evaluation of Geroprotective Effects of Selected Flavonoids in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans,29375370,10.3389/fphar.2017.00884,"Flavonoids is an intensively studied group of natural compounds with antioxidant, antineoplastic, antihyperglycemic, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties. The present study intends to investigate the geroprotective action of three selected flavonoids (naringin, luteolin, chrysin) in two model organisms, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Luteolin and chrysin were shown to improve lifespan parameters when administered to both model organisms. The observed positive effects of these flavonoids in D. melanogaster were limited to females and were not associated with reduced fecundity or locomotor impairment. The life-extending effects of flavonoids were observed in N2 wild-type worms but absent in aak-2(gt33) mutants implying that these effects can be associated with AMP-activated protein kinase activity. Naringin improved lifespan parameters of C. elegans, but had no effect on D. melanogaster females; in some cases, naringin was found to decrease the lifespan of males. Compared to chrysin and luteolin, however, naringin more effectively activates Nrf2 target genes (particularly, GstD1) under oxidative stress. Then we compared molecular mechanisms of studied compounds and a well-known geroprotector rapamycin, using software tool GeroScope. There are no transcriptomic data on luteolin or chrysin provided by LINCS Project database. The bioinformatics comparison of transcriptomics data for A549 and MCF7 human cell lines treated with rapamycin or naringin revealed that these compounds share just a few common signaling pathways and quite distinct in their geroprotective action.

Transcriptional signatures in response to wheat germ agglutinin and starvation in Drosophila melanogaster larval midgut,19196346,10.1111/j.1365-2583.2008.00844.x,"One function of plant lectins such as wheat germ agglutinin is to serve as defences against herbivorous insects. The midgut is one critical site affected by dietary lectins. We observed marked cellular, structural and gene expression changes in the midguts of Drosophila melanogaster third instar larvae that were fed wheat germ agglutinin. Some of these changes were similar to those observed in the midguts of starved D. melanogaster. Dietary wheat germ agglutinin caused shortening, branching, swelling, distortion and in some cases disintegration of the midgut microvilli. Starvation was accompanied primarily by shortening of the microvilli. Microarray analyses revealed that dietary wheat germ agglutinin evoked differential expression of 61 transcripts; seven of these were also differentially expressed in starved D. melanogaster. The differentially transcribed gene clusters in wheat germ agglutinin-fed larvae were associated with (1) cytoskeleton organization; (2) digestive enzymes; (3) detoxification reactions; and (4) energy metabolism. Four possible transcription factor binding motifs were associated with the differentially expressed genes. One of these exhibited substantial similarity to MyoD, a transcription factor binding motif associated with cellular structures in mammals. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that wheat germ agglutinin caused a starvation-like effect and structural changes of midgut cells of D. melanogaster third-instar larvae.",2009,"H-M Li, L Sun, O Mittapalli, W M Muir, J Xie, J Wu, B J Schemerhorn, W Sun, B R Pittendrigh, L L Murdock"
Isolation of hnRNP complexes from Drosophila melanogaster,1730753,10.1083/jcb.116.2.245,"Nascent RNA polymerase II transcripts, heterogeneous nuclear RNAs (hnRNAs), become associated with nuclear proteins (hnRNP Proteins), and their processing into mRNAs takes place in these hnRNP complexes. hnRNP complexes have previously been purified from vertebrate cells. Here we report the isolation of hnRNP complexes from an invertebrate organism, the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. Candidate hnRNP proteins were purified from D. melanogaster embryos by ssDNA affinity chromatography, and mAbs were produced to many of the major proteins. Genuine hnRNP proteins were identified by several criteria, including nucleoplasmic localization, association with nascent transcripts, crosslinking to poly(A)-containing RNA in living cells, and amino acid sequence. In addition, mAbs that cross-react between the fruitfly and human hnRNP proteins were obtained. Most importantly, using hnRNP-specific mAbs we have purified the hnRNP complexes from D. melanogaster cells. These RNAase-sensitive complexes contain at least 10 major proteins designated hrps, the most abundant proteins having apparent molecular masses of 36, 38, 39, 40, 44, 48, 54, 62, 70, and 75 kD. cDNAs and complete sequences for several of these proteins have been obtained and are presented in the accompanying paper (Matunis, E.

Estimated parameters of intraspecific variation in D. melanogaster (exons: theta = 0.018, pi = 0.018; intron: theta = 0.014, pi = 0.014) and D. simulans (exons: theta = 0.007, pi = 0.005; intron: theta = 0.008, pi = 0.005) were below average for other X-linked genes, while divergence between species (exons: D = 0.094; intron: D = 0.069) fell within the normal range for both silent and replacement changes. This estimate for runt, along with published values for three other genes in regions of normal recombination, show east African D. melanogaster to be roughly twice as polymorphic as D. simulans. The majority of nucleotide variation, silent and replacement, in both species was found to be selectively neutral using various statistical tests (HKA, McDonald-Kreitman, Tajima, and Fu and Li tests). Monte Carlo simulations of the coalescent process significantly rejected a Wright-Fisher model with respect to an amino acid polymorphism and the distribution of polymorphic sites among the D. simulans lines.

Chromosomal homologies between Drosophila lebanonensis and D. melanogaster determined by in situ hybridization,8325168,10.1007/BF00661280,"Twelve biotin-labelled recombinant DNA probes were hybridized to polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster and D. lebanonensis.

Six probes correspond to known genes from D. melanogaster (RpII215, H3-H4, MHC, hsp28/23, hsp83, hsp70), four probes are clones isolated from a D. subobscura library (Xdh, lambda DsubS3, lambdaDsubG3, lambdaDsubG4) and the remaining two probes correspond to the Adh gene of D. lebanonensis and to one sequence (262), not yet characterized, from the same species. The chromosomal homologies obtained from the in situ hybridization results allow us to determine that Muller's C and D chromosomal elements are fused in the karyotype of D. lebanonensis and constitute the large metacentric chromosome. Single pericentric inversions in the E and B elements have generated the medium and small metacentric chromosomes, respectively. No great changes are detected in Muller's A element, which remains acrocentric. The changes detected in the karyotypic evolution of D. lebanonensis are frequently observed in Drosophila evolution, as deduced from chromosomal homologies of several Drosophila species.

The sibling species group comprised of two cosmopolitan (Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans) and two island (Drosophila mauritiana and Drosophila sechellia) species has become a model system for such studies. In the present study we reanalyzed the pattern of protein variation in these species, and the results were compared against the patterns of nucleotide variation obtained from the literature, mostly available for melanogaster and simulans. We have mainly focused on the contrasting patterns of variation between the cosmopolitan pair. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) As expected the island species D. mauritiana and D. sechellia showed much less variation than the cosmopolitan species D. melanogaster and D. simulans. (2) The chromosome 2 showed significantly less variation than chromosome 3 and X in all four species which may indicate effects of past selective sweeps. (3) In contrast to its overall low variation, D. mauritiana showed highest variation for X-linked loci which may indicate introgression from its sibling, D. simulans. (4) An average population of D. simulans was as heterozygous as that of D. melanogaster (14.4% v.s. 13.9%) but the difference was large and significant when considering only polymorphic loci (37.2% v.s. 26.1%). (5) The species-wise pooled populations of these two species showed similar results (all loci = 18.3% v.s. 20.0%, polymorphic loci = 47.2% v.s. 37.6%). (6) An average population of D. simulans had more low-frequency alleles than D. melanogaster, and the D. simulans alleles were found widely distributed in all populations whereas the D. melanogaster alleles were limited to local populations. As a results of this, pooled populations of D. melanogaster showed more polymorphic loci than those of D. simulans (48.0% v.s. 32.0%) but the difference was reduced when the comparison was made on the basis of an average population (29.1% v.s. 21.4%). (7) While the allele frequency distributions within populations were nonsignificant in both D. melanogaster and D. simulans, melanogaster had fewer than simulans, but more than expected from the neutral theory, low frequency alleles. (8) Diallelic loci with the second allele with a frequency less than 20% had similar frequencies in all four species but those with the second allele with a frequency higher than 20% were limited to only melanogaster the latter group of loci have clinal (latitudinal) patterns of variation indicative of balancing selection. (9) The comparison of D. simulans/D. melanogaster protein variation gave a ratio of 1.04 for all loci and 1.42 for polymorphic loci, against a ratio of approximately 2-fold difference for silent nucleotide sites. This suggests that the species ratios of protein and silent nucleotide polymorphism are too close to call for selective difference between silent and allozyme variation in D. simulans. In conclusion, the contrasting levels of allozyme polymorphism, distribution of rare alleles, number of diallelic loci and the patterns of geographic differentiation between the two species suggest the role of natural selection in D. melanogaster, and of possibly ancient population structure and recent worldwide migration in D. simulans. Population size differences alone are insufficient as an explanation for the patterns of variation between these two species.",2004,"Richard A Morton, Madhu Choudhary, Marie-Louise Cariou, Rama S Singh"
[Trans-mobilization of deletion copies of the mdg3 retrotransposon in cultured cells of Drosophila],9589861,,"A model system was studied that was associated with the selective amplification of shortened copies of the mdg3 retrotransposon in cultured cells of Drosophila melanogaster. While full-length mdg3 is present in all species phylogenetically closely related to D. melanogaster, the distribution of its deletion copy mdg3del was shown to be restricted only to D. melanogaster strains. mdg3del appeared to be amplified in two Drosophila cell lines of different origin. A ""generalized"" (statistically averaged) sequence of the shortened copy from a cell line Schneider2 was determined. The structure of this copy was shown to be the same as in the other tested strains of Drosophila. In addition to the major deletion involving the reverse transcriptase domain and a part of the ribonuclease H domain, several other deletions, insertions, and point substitutions were also revealed in shortened copies. The population of shortened copies was shown to result from the amplification of a single mdg3del copy in the genome of Schneider2 cells. The results obtained suggest that defective copies of the retrotransposon can be trans-mobilized in cultured cells and that the mechanisms of retroamplification in cell cultures and in an organism are different.",1998,"S N Avedisov, E S Zelentsova, Iu V Il'in"

CYP303A1 has a conserved function in adult eclosion in Locusta migratoria and Drosophila melanogaster,31422152,10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103210,"Insect cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) play essential roles in both xenobiotic metabolism and developmental processes. However, the exact physiological function of many CYP genes remains largely unknown. Screening the expression of the CYP genes from the CYP2 and mitochondrial CYP clans of Drosophila melanogaster revealed that Cyp303a1 is highly expressed in the pupal stage. Knockdown of CYP303A1 transcripts by RNAi using the Gal4/UAS system with a ubiquitous driver (tubulin-Gal4) in Drosophila or by dsRNA injection in the last nymph stage of Locusta migratoria resulted in severe defects in eclosion and lethality during and after adult emergence. In Drosophila, tissue-specific RNAi of Cyp303a1 with a wing-specific driver (MS1096-Gal4) revealed that Cyp303a1 was essential for wing extension. Stage-specific RNAi of Cyp303a1 using Gal80ts for thermal-dependent-suppression found that the expression of Cyp303a1 at the middle pupal stage was absolutely required. Meanwhile, Cyp303a1 mutants exhibited more than 80% lethality at the late embryonic development stages. Embryonic lethality of the Cyp303a1 mutants was fully rescued by the ubiquitous overexpression of exogenous Cyp303a1. Taken together, we conclude that Cyp303a1 is indispensable for embryonic development and adult eclosion in D. melanogaster, the latter role being conserved over 400 million years of insect evolution.",2019,"Lixian Wu, Qiangqiang Jia, Xubo Zhang, Xueyao Zhang, Suning Liu, Yoonseong Park, René Feyereisen, Kun Yan Zhu, Enbo Ma, Jianzhen Zhang, Sheng Li"
Adenylate kinase 2 deficiency limits survival and regulates various genes during larval stages of Drosophila melanogaster,24705759,10.2152/jmi.61.137,"Adenylate kinase isozyme 2 (AK2) is located in mitochondrial intermembrane space and regulates energy metabolism by reversibly converting ATP and AMP to 2 ADPs. We previously demonstrated that disruption of the Drosophila melanogaster AK2 gene (Dak2) resulted in growth arrest during the larval stage and subsequent death. Two other groups found that human AK2 mutations cause reticular dysgenesis, a form of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) that is associated with severe hematopoietic defects and sensorineural deafness. However, the mechanisms underlying differential outcomes of AK2 deficiency in Drosophila and human systems remain unknown. In this study, effects of tissue-specific inactivation of the Dak2 gene on Drosophila development were analyzed using RNAi-mediated gene knockdown. In addition, to investigate the roles of AK2 in the regulation of gene expression during development, microarray analysis was performed using RNA from first and second instar larvae of Dak2-deficient mutant and wild-type D. melanogaster. Knockdown of Dak2 in all germ layers caused cessation of growth and subsequent death of flies. Microarray analysis revealed that Dak2 deficiency downregulates various genes, particularly those involved in the proteasomal function and in mitochondrial translation machinery. These data indicate that adenine nucleotide interconversion by Dak2 is crucial for developmental processes of Drosophila melanogaster.",2014,"Taigo Horiguchi, Miyuki Fuka, Koichi Fujisawa, Ayako Tanimura, Keiko Miyoshi, Ryutaro Murakami, Takafumi Noma"
Dissecting chill coma recovery as a measure of cold resistance: evidence for a biphasic response in Drosophila melanogaster,15288203,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2004.05.004,"Cold resistance in insects has traditionally been measured in terms of survival following a stress, but alternative methods are increasingly being used because of their relevance to the ecology of organisms and their utility in characterizing variation among species, populations and individuals. One such method capable of discriminating among Drosophila species and conspecific Drosophila populations from different environments is adult chill coma recovery time, the time taken for adults to become active again after being knocked down by a cold stress. Here we characterized the chill coma response of D. melanogaster in detail. Adults were exposed to a range of temperatures and stressful periods prior to measuring recovery. Recovery from chill coma in D. melanogaster was biphasic; as flies were stressed under cooler temperatures, recovery times leveled off and then decreased before sharply increasing again as mortality starts to occur. This biphasic response has previously been observed in D. subobscura where it has a somewhat different shape. A second mechanism therefore acts at relatively lower temperatures to ameliorate the effects of the cold stress. When D. melanogaster were reared at 19 and 25 degrees C for two generations, the shape of the curve relating temperature to recovery time was similar, but flies from the warmer temperature had longer recovery times and showed responses that leveled off and then decreased at relatively higher temperatures. As exposure time to cold stress was increased, recovery times also increased except at mild stress levels. Chill coma recovery in D. melanogaster is a complex trait and likely to reflect multiple underlying components.",2004,"S S Macdonald, L Rako, P Batterham, A A Hoffmann"
Yolk proteins in the male reproductive system of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster: spatial and temporal patterns of expression,24556521,10.1016/j.ibmb.2014.02.001,"In insects, spermatozoa develop in the testes as clones of single spermatogonia covered by specialized somatic cyst cells (cc). Upon completion of spermatogenesis, spermatozoa are released to the vas deferens, while the cc remain in the testes and die. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the released spermatozoa first reach the seminal vesicles (SV), the organ where post-testicular maturation begins. Here, we demonstrate the temporal (restricted to the evening and early night hours) accumulation of membranous vesicles containing proteins in the SV lumen of D. melanogaster. When SV vesicles were isolated from the semen and co-incubated with testis-derived spermatozoa in vitro, their contents bound to the spermatozoa along their tails. The proteins of the SV vesicles were then characterized using 2-D electrophoresis. We identified a prominent protein spot of around 45-47 kDa, which disappears from the SV vesicles in the night, i.e. shortly after they appear in the SV lumen. Sequencing of peptides derived from this spot by mass spectrometry revealed identity with three yolk proteins (YP1-3). This unexpected result was confirmed by western blotting, which demonstrated that SV vesicles contain proteins that are immunoreactive with an antibody against D. melanogaster YP1-3. The expression of all yp genes was shown to be a unique feature of testis tissues. Using RNA probes we found that their transcripts localize exclusively to the cc that cover fully developed spermatozoa in the distal part of each testis. Temporally, the expression of yp genes was found to be restricted to a short period during the day and is followed by the evening accumulation of YP proteins in the cc. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed that cc are the source of SV vesicles containing YPs that are released into the SV lumen. These vesicles interact with spermatozoa and as a result, YPs become extrinsic proteins of the sperm membrane. Thus, we describe for the first time the expression of yolk proteins in the male reproductive system of D. melanogaster under physiological conditions, and show that somatic cells of the testes are the source of these proteins.",2014,"Magdalena M Majewska, Agnieszka Suszczynska, Joanna Kotwica-Rolinska, Tomasz Czerwik, Bohdan Paterczyk, Marta A Polanska, Piotr Bernatowicz, Piotr Bebas"

To achieve this in any vertebrate transporting epithelium remains a daunting task, as the genetic tools available are still relatively unsophisticated. Drosophila melanogaster, however, is an outstanding model organism for molecular genetics. Here we describe a technique for fluid secretion assays in the D. melanogaster equivalent of the kidney nephron. The development of this first physiological assay for a Drosophila epithelium, allowing combined approaches of integrative physiology and functional genomics, has now provided biologists with an entirely new model system, the Drosophila Malpighian tubule, which is utilized in multiple fields as diverse as kidney disease research and development of new modes of pest insect control.",2019,"Shireen-A Davies, Pablo Cabrero, Richard Marley, Guillermo Martinez Corrales, Saurav Ghimire, Anthony J Dornan, Julian A T Dow"

Drosophila chorion is produced by epithelial follicle cells and one of its functional serving role is egg fertilization through the micropyle, a specialized narrow channel at the anterior tip of the egg [2]. Sperm entry during fertilization is necessary for the egg to complete meiosis [3]. D. melanogaster flies being characterized by severe downregulation of the s36 chorionic protein, specifically in the follicle-cell compartment of their ovary, appear with impaired fly fertility (Velentzas et al., 2016) [1]. In an effort to further investigate whether the observed infertility in the s36-targeted flies derives from a fertilization failure, such as the inability of sperm to pass through egg׳s micropyle, we mated females carrying s36-depleted ovaries with males expressing the GFP protein either in their sperm tails, or in both their sperm tails and sperm heads.",2017,"Athanassios D Velentzas, Panagiotis D Velentzas, Stamatia Katarachia, Vassiliki E Mpakou, Issidora S Papassideri, Dimitrios J Stravopodis"
Efficient amplification of Drosophila simulans copia directed by high-level reverse transcriptase activity associated with copia virus-like particles,1383092,10.1016/0378-1119(92)90093-5,"The number of retrotransposon copia per genome in Drosophila melanogaster cultured cells is two to three times higher than that in D. melanogaster embryo cells. Here, we have found that the genome of the related species, Drosophila simulans, contains in cultured cells more efficiently amplified copia DNA (approximately ten fold). Furthermore, we analyzed copia virus-like particles (VLPs) prepared from D. melanogaster and D. simulans cultured cells, which contain copia RNA and reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, and thus, play a major role in copia replication. The RT activity associated with the D. simulans VLPs was 25 times higher than that associated with the D. melanogaster VLPs. Taken together with the fact that copia is believed to transpose through an RNA intermediate, these results suggest that the amplification of copia DNA should relate to copia RNA-mediated transposition, and the higher RT activity associated with the D. simulans VLPs would lead to the efficient amplification of copia DNA. In a comparison between D. melanogaster and D. simulans copia nucleotide (nt) sequences, five nt substitutions, which cause the respective amino acid changes, were found in the copia RT-coding region. Polymerase chain reaction direct sequencing showed that these five substitutions are the vast majority in each Drosophila species. The substitutions, therefore, may be responsible for the high level of the RT activity associated with the D. simulans VLPs.",1992,"K Yoshioka, H Kanda, N Takamatsu, S Togashi, S Kondo, T Miyake, Y Sakaki, T Shiba"
Intraspecific and interspecific variation at the y-ac-sc region of Drosophila simulans and Drosophila melanogaster,1582559,,"A 2.2-kb region including the ac gene of Drosophila simulans has been sequenced. Interspecific divergence between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans was estimated as 0.0695 and 0.0558 for silent and for all sites, respectively. Estimated silent site divergence for the ac region is comparable to that estimated for other regions of the genome between these species, indicating that silent sites of the ac region are not under significantly stronger functional constraint. Intraspecific variation in both species was also investigated. Restriction-site and length polymorphism in the ac region of D. simulans has been investigated for 103 X chromosome lines sampled from three natural populations in Spain using eight four-cutter restriction enzymes. Neither restriction-site nor length variation was detected in the three populations surveyed. In D. melanogaster restriction-site and length polymorphism in all major transcription units of the y-ac-sc region (23.1-kb region) has been studied using four four-cutter restriction enzymes for 245 X chromosome lines sampled from 10 natural populations (seven from Europe, two from North America and one from Japan). Fourteen restriction-site and 28 length polymorphisms were detected. There was some indication of population subdivision for North American vs. European samples of D. melanogaster. The frequency spectrum of restriction-site polymorphisms in European populations was skewed toward rarer frequencies than predicted by the neutral theory. Comparison of silent site variation at this telomeric region with that in the Adh 5'-flanking region showed a reduced level of heterozygosity in the y-ac-sc region. Since interspecific silent divergence is not reduced in the y-ac-sc region as compared to other regions, the reduction in standing levels of variation at this telomeric locus in both D. simulans and D. melanogaster is most easily explained by a hitchhiking effect of linked selected substitutions.",1992,"J M Martín-Campos, J M Comerón, N Miyashita, M Aguadé"
"Mitochondrial glutamate carriers from Drosophila melanogaster: biochemical, evolutionary and modeling studies",23850633,10.1016/j.bbabio.2013.07.002,"The mitochondrial carriers are members of a family of transport proteins that mediate solute transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Two isoforms of the glutamate carriers, GC1 and GC2 (encoded by the SLC25A22 and SLC25A18 genes, respectively), have been identified in humans. Two independent mutations in SLC25A22 are associated with severe epileptic encephalopathy. In the present study we show that two genes (CG18347 and CG12201) phylogenetically related to the human GC encoding genes are present in the D. melanogaster genome. We have functionally characterized the proteins encoded by CG18347 and CG12201, designated as DmGC1p and DmGC2p respectively, by overexpression in Escherichia coli and reconstitution into liposomes. Their transport properties demonstrate that DmGC1p and DmGC2p both catalyze the transport of glutamate across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Computational approaches have been used in order to highlight residues of DmGC1p and DmGC2p involved in substrate binding. Furthermore, gene expression analysis during development and in various adult tissues reveals that CG18347 is ubiquitously expressed in all examined D. melanogaster tissues, while the expression of CG12201 is strongly testis-biased. Finally, we identified mitochondrial glutamate carrier orthologs in 49 eukaryotic species in order to attempt the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the glutamate carrier function. Comparison of the exon/intron structure and other key features of the analyzed orthologs suggests that eukaryotic glutamate carrier genes descend from an intron-rich ancestral gene already present in the common ancestor of lineages that diverged as early as bilateria and radiata.",2013,"Paola Lunetti, Anna Rita Cappello, René Massimiliano Marsano, Ciro Leonardo Pierri, Chiara Carrisi, Emanuela Martello, Corrado Caggese, Vincenza Dolce, Loredana Capobianco"

We amplified the fragments from ORF2 to ORF3 of P elements using PCR and calculated the defective frequencies and defective parameters of P elements from different places. Basing on the distribution of defective P elements, we suggested the invasion route of P elements of D. melanogaster in Northeast China. The results indicate that the defective frequencies decrease from the frontier to the inland, and in the isolated places the frequencies are lower.

Ehrlichia chaffeensis infections in Drosophila melanogaster,19687202,10.1128/IAI.00594-09,"Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligate, intracellular bacterium, transmitted by the tick Amblyomma americanum, and is the causative agent of human monocytic ehrlichiosis infections. We previously demonstrated that E. chaffeensis is capable of growing in Drosophila S2 cells. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that E. chaffeensis can infect adult Drosophila melanogaster. Adult Drosophila organisms were experimentally challenged with intra-abdominal injections of bacteria. Ehrlichia-infected flies showed decreased survival compared to wild-type flies, and bacteria isolated from flies could reinfect mammalian macrophages. Ehrlichia infections activated both the cellular and humoral immune responses in the fly. Hemocytes phagocytosed bacteria after injection, and antimicrobial peptide pathways were induced following infection. Increased pathogenicity in flies carrying mutations in genes in both the Toll and Imd pathways suggests that both immune defense pathways participate in host defense. Induction of Drosophila cellular and humoral responses and the in vivo replication of E. chaffeensis suggests that D. melanogaster is a suitable host for E. chaffeensis.

By contrast, the euchromatic part of the D. melanogaster genome contains only profoundly damaged GATE copies or fragments of the transposon. The preferential localization of GATE sequences in heterochromatin was confirmed for the other species in the melanogaster subgroup.

High anti-viral protection without immune upregulation after interspecies Wolbachia transfer,24911519,10.1371/journal.pone.0099025,"Wolbachia, endosymbionts that reside naturally in up to 40-70% of all insect species, are some of the most prevalent intracellular bacteria. Both Wolbachia wAu, naturally associated with Drosophila simulans, and wMel, native to Drosophila melanogaster, have been previously described to protect their hosts against viral infections. wMel transferred to D. simulans was also shown to have a strong antiviral effect. Here we directly compare one of the most protective wMel variants and wAu in D. melanogaster in the same host genetic background. We conclude that wAu protects better against viral infections, it grows exponentially and significantly shortens the lifespan of D. melanogaster. However, there is no difference between wMel and wAu in the expression of selected antimicrobial peptides. Therefore, neither the difference in anti-viral effect nor the life-shortening could be attributed to the immune stimulation by exogenous Wolbachia. Overall, we prove that stable transinfection with a highly protective Wolbachia is not necessarily associated with general immune activation.",2014,"Ewa Chrostek, Marta S P Marialva, Ryuichi Yamada, Scott L O'Neill, Luis Teixeira"
Misregulation of sex-lethal and disruption of male-specific lethal complex localization in Drosophila species hybrids,16951071,10.1534/genetics.106.060541,"A major model system for the study of evolutionary divergence between closely related species has been the unisexual lethality resulting from reciprocal crosses of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. Sex-lethal (Sxl), a critical gene for sex determination, is misregulated in these hybrids. In hybrid males from D. melanogaster mothers, there is an abnormal expression of Sxl and a failure of localization of the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex to the X chromosome, which causes changes in gene expression. Introduction of a Sxl mutation into this hybrid genotype will allow expression of the MSL complex but there is no sequestration to the X chromosome. Lethal hybrid rescue (Lhr), which allows hybrid males from this cross to survive, corrects the SXL and MSL defects. The reciprocal cross of D. simulans mothers by D. melanogaster males exhibits underexpression of Sxl in embryos.",2006,"Manika Pal Bhadra, Utpal Bhadra, James A Birchler"
Correlated evolution of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites in Drosophila,15599509,10.1007/s00239-004-2671-2,"Recent work has shown that Drosophila melanogaster genes with fast-evolving nonsynonymous sites have lower codon usage bias. This pattern has been attributed to interference between positive selection at nonsynonymous sites and weak selection on codon usage. Here we have looked for this correlation in a much larger and less biased dataset, comprising 630 gene pairs from D. melanogaster and D. yakuba. We confirmed that there is a negative correlation between the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions (d(N)) and codon bias in D. melanogaster. We then tested the interference hypothesis and other alternative explanations, including one involving gene expression. We found that d(N) indeed correlates with the level of gene expression. Given that gene expression is a strong determinant of codon bias, the relationship between d(N) and codon bias might be a by-product of gene expression. However, our tests show that none of the hypotheses we consider seem to explain the data fully.",2004,"Gabriel Marais, Tomislav Domazet-Loso, Diethard Tautz, Brian Charlesworth"
Evolutionary history and mechanism of the Drosophila cecropin gene family,9553148,10.1007/s002510050379,"Upon bacterial infection, insects secrete a set of synthesized antibacterial proteins into the hemolymph and initiate synergistic destruction of invaders. Cecropin is one such antibacterial protein which is also found in vertebrates. To study the evolutionary history and mechanism of the Cecropin gene family, we determined DNA sequences of one isogenic In(3R)C and six isofemale lines of Drosophila melanogaster as well as one line of D. simulans and of D. yakuba. The phylogenetic analysis of these sequences together with those published for D. virilis and Sarcophaga peregrina reveals frequent gene re-organization. It was also found that silent nucleotide differences within D. melanogaster are quite heterogeneous across the gene region of approximately 3 kilobases and the extent of polymorphism is unusually usually high. These data suggest that the Cecropin gene region of D. melanogaster underwent intragenic recombination as well as introgression from a closely related sibling species, D. simulans.",1998,"A Date, Y Satta, N Takahata, S I Chigusa"

Wolbachia infected D. melanogaster mutation strains Trithorax-like -- Trl362/TM3, Sb1 Ser y+ and Trlen82/TM3, Sb1 Ser y+ have been received by special flies crossing. Uninfected strain D. melanogaster white-1118 (w1118) have been obtained by antibiotic treatment of initially infected strain D. melanogaster [w]w1118. Complex of different methods and approaches let to investigate for the first time the morphology of cell structure before and after bacterial infection of insects and to value the bacterial presence effect on flies viability and reproduction of normal and mutant flies. Morphology af cytoplasmic compartments in early embryos and eggs layed by infected and uninfecyed females Trl362/TM3, Sb1 Ser y+ and Trlen82/TM3, Sb1 Ser y+ have been analyzed. Electron microscopy has shown that D. melanogaster embryos contain typical Wolbachia contacting with different host organelles that verify preservation of their functional activity. Atificial mitochondria and Wolbachia (wMelPop) of unusual morphology with defective bacterial membranes have been visualised in D. melanogaster [w]Trl362/TM3, Sb1 Ser y+. Wolbachia presence in ovarium cells from strains [w]Trl362/TM3, Sb1 Ser y+ and [w]Trlen82/TM3, Sb1 Ser y+ did not influence on eggs quantity layed by females. We have demonstrated for the first time that lifespan of infected and uninfected strains: D. melanogaster Trl362/TM3, Sb1 Ser y+ and Trlen82/TM3, Sb1 Ser y+ were similar. However the lifespan of imago from strain [w]w1118 was lower in comparison to those from strains Trl362/TM3, Sb1 Ser y+ and Trlen82/TM3, Sb1 Ser y+. It suggests that either chromosomal balancer TM3 or Trl mutation play an importance role in host-symbiotic relationship.

Comparison of the GAGA factor genes of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis reveals high conservation of GAGA factor structure beyond the BTB/POZ and DNA-binding domains,9799425,10.1007/s004270050202,"As a member of the trithorax-group, the Trithorax-like (Trl) gene of Drosophila melanogaster contributes to the expression of homeotic genes and many other genes. Trl encodes different isoforms of the GAGA factor which is thought to act as an ""antirepressor"" of transcription by remodelling chromatin structure and thereby rendering control regions accessible for transcriptional activators. A more global role of the GAGA factor in chromatin structure and function is suggested by various phenotypes of Trl mutations, such as modification of position effect variegation. To better define the molecular basis of these pleiotropic effects, we cloned cDNAs encoding the GAGA isoforms of D. melanogaster and a distantly related species, D. virilis. We also characterized the genomic organization of both the D. melanogaster and D. virilis genes, and analysed the expression patterns of isoform-specific mRNAs. The D. virilis GAGA isoforms show high similarity to their D. melanogaster counterparts, particularly within the BTB/POZ protein-interaction and the zinc finger DNA-binding domains. Interestingly, conservation clearly extends beyond the previously defined limits of these domains. Moreover, the comparison reveals a completely conserved block of amino acid residues located between the BTB/POZ and DNA-binding domains, and a high conservation of the C-terminus specific for one of the GAGA isoforms. Thus, sequences of as yet unknown functions are defined as rewarding targets for further mutational analyses. The high conservation of the GAGA proteins of the two species is in accord with the nearly identical genomic organization and expression patterns of the corresponding genes.",1998,"K G Lintermann, G E Roth, K King-Jones, G Korge, M Lehmann"
Functional study of mammalian Neph proteins in Drosophila melanogaster,22792268,10.1371/journal.pone.0040300,"Neph molecules are highly conserved immunoglobulin superfamily proteins (IgSF) which are essential for multiple morphogenetic processes, including glomerular development in mammals and neuronal as well as nephrocyte development in D. melanogaster. While D. melanogaster expresses two Neph-like proteins (Kirre and IrreC/Rst), three Neph proteins (Neph1-3) are expressed in the mammalian system. However, although these molecules are highly abundant, their molecular functions are still poorly understood. Here we report on a fly system in which we overexpress and replace endogenous Neph homologs with mammalian Neph1-3 proteins to identify functional Neph protein networks required for neuronal and nephrocyte development. Misexpression of Neph1, but neither Neph2 nor Neph3, phenocopies the overexpression of endogenous Neph molecules suggesting a functional diversity of mammalian Neph family proteins. Moreover, structure-function analysis identified a conserved and specific Neph1 protein motif that appears to be required for the functional replacement of Kirre. Hereby, we establish D. melanogaster as a genetic system to specifically model molecular Neph1 functions in vivo and identify a conserved amino acid motif linking Neph1 to Drosophila Kirre function.",2012,"Martin Helmstädter, Kevin Lüthy, Markus Gödel, Matias Simons, Ashish, Deepak Nihalani, Stefan A Rensing, Karl-Friedrich Fischbach, Tobias B Huber"

In certain Drosophila melanogaster-D. simulans hybrids, hybrid male sterility is caused by the lack of a single-copy gene essential for male fertility, JYAlpha. This gene is located on the fourth chromosome of D. melanogaster but on the third chromosome of D. simulans. Genomic and molecular analyses show that JYAlpha transposed to the third chromosome during the evolutionary history of the D. simulans lineage. Because of this transposition, a fraction of hybrids completely lack JYAlpha and are sterile, representing reproductive isolation without sequence evolution.",2006,"John P Masly, Corbin D Jones, Mohamed A F Noor, John Locke, H Allen Orr"
A neuropeptide regulates fighting behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,32314736,10.7554/eLife.54229,"Aggressive behavior is regulated by various neuromodulators such as neuropeptides and biogenic amines. Here we found that the neuropeptide Drosulfakinin (Dsk) modulates aggression in Drosophila melanogaster. Knock-out of Dsk or Dsk receptor CCKLR-17D1 reduced aggression. Activation and inactivation of Dsk-expressing neurons increased and decreased male aggressive behavior, respectively. Moreover, data from transsynaptic tracing, electrophysiology and behavioral epistasis reveal that Dsk-expressing neurons function downstream of a subset of P1 neurons (P1a-splitGAL4) to control fighting behavior. In addition, winners show increased calcium activity in Dsk-expressing neurons. Conditional overexpression of Dsk promotes social dominance, suggesting a positive correlation between Dsk signaling and winning effects. The mammalian ortholog CCK has been implicated in mammal aggression, thus our work suggests a conserved neuromodulatory system for the modulation of aggressive behavior.",2020,"Fengming Wu, Bowen Deng, Na Xiao, Tao Wang, Yining Li, Rencong Wang, Kai Shi, Dong-Gen Luo, Yi Rao, Chuan Zhou"

We find that the boost to fecundity known to occur after a virgin female's initial mating also extends to subsequent matings as nonvirgins, but only for a short duration. This fecundity boost at least partially offsets the direct costs of multiple matings to females in this population of D. melanogaster.

In this study, we test for the maintenance of fertility in overwintering males from the eastern Australian D. melanogaster cline. Males from southern temperate populations maintained in field cages in temperate Melbourne had a higher fertility in spring compared with males from tropical locations. Temperate males successfully inseminated more females, and there were also more offspring produced per inseminated female. The resulting linear post-winter fertility clines were unrelated to male body size. In contrast, there was no clinal variation for fertility in nonoverwintering males held in the laboratory.

Transposase titration in Drosophila melanogaster: a model of cytotype in the P-M system of hybrid dysgenesis,2999793,10.1073/pnas.82.23.8119,"In the P-M system of hybrid dysgenesis of Drosophila melanogaster, some M strains possess chromosomal P elements. The chromosomes from one of these pseudo-M strains reduced the instability of a P element-insertion mutation of the singed bristle locus. We suggest that this reduction is an indication of competition for a transposase that binds to the P elements on the chromosomes from the pseudo-M strain as well as to the P elements at the singed locus; the pseudo-M strain's P elements might therefore be said to titrate the transposase, reducing its availability to interact with the P elements at the singed locus. We hypothesize that a similar mechanism regulates the movement of P elements in the P strains of D. melanogaster, although in this case we propose that the titrating elements are extrachromosomal and that they are generated by the action of the transposase itself.",1985,"M J Simmons, L M Bucholz"

The differences between populations are those expected from genetic adaptation to local microclimates. How such differentiation could evolve and be maintained despite the likelihood of genetic exchange between populations is a challenging question. We hypothesized that interslope microclimatic differences caused strong differential selection for stress tolerance, accompanied by behavioral differentiation (habitat choice and reduced migration rate), reinforced by sexual isolation.

Our simple numerical model predicted that the fitness of a polymorphic population would be higher than that expected with two monomorphic populations, but only under balancing selection. Moreover, this positive diversity effect of genetic polymorphism was attributable to a complementarity effect, rather than to a selection effect. Our empirical tests using the behavioural polymorphism in D. melanogaster clearly supported the model predictions.

Evidence for adaptive male mate choice in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,16627276,10.1098/rspb.2005.3372,"Theory predicts that males will benefit when they bias their mating effort towards females of higher reproductive potential, and that this discrimination will increase as males become more resource limited. We conducted a series of experiments to test these predictions in a laboratory population of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster. In this species, courtship and copulation have significant costs to males, and females vary greatly in fecundity, which is positively associated with body size. When given a simultaneous choice between small and large virgin females, males preferentially mated with larger, more fecund, females. Moreover, after males had recently mated they showed a stronger preference for larger females. These results suggest that male D. melanogaster adaptively allocate their mating effort in response to variation in female quality and provide some of the first support for the theoretical prediction that male stringency in mate choice increases as resources become more limiting.",2006,"Phillip G Byrne, William R Rice"

Unlike the rest of the chromosomes, D. mauritiana has the chromosome 3 with firm combinated arms and the large heterochromatic block in the centromere, without being attached to the nuclear envelope.",1991,"V N Stegniĭ, I E Vasserlauf"
Gene Flow in Natural Populations of DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER with Special Reference to Lethal Allelism Rates and Protein Variation,17246328,,"A simultaneous survey of 14 protein loci, together with frequencies and within- and between-population allelism rates of lethal chromosomes, was carried out in five (four Japanese and one Korean) natural populations and one cage population of Drosophila melanogaster. It was found that lethal allelism rates decrease rapidly as geographic distance between two populations increases, while variation at protein loci shows a remarkable similarity over all populations examined. These findings suggest that there are very high levels of gene flow in these natural populations and that selection at protein loci which can maintain substantial geographic variation, if present, is overshadowed by gene flow. There is no indication that invasion of D. melanogaster to the Far East occurred so recently that the frequencies of lethal chromosomes are still in nonequilibrium.",1986,"T Yamazaki, J K Choo, T K Watanabe, N Takahata"
Turning males on: activation of male courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,21731661,10.1371/journal.pone.0021144,"The innate sexual behaviors of Drosophila melanogaster males are an attractive system for elucidating how complex behavior patterns are generated. The potential for male sexual behavior in D. melanogaster is specified by the fruitless (fru) and doublesex (dsx) sex regulatory genes. We used the temperature-sensitive activator dTRPA1 to probe the roles of fru(M)- and dsx-expressing neurons in male courtship behaviors. Almost all steps of courtship, from courtship song to ejaculation, can be induced at very high levels through activation of either all fru(M) or all dsx neurons in solitary males. Detailed characterizations reveal different roles for fru(M) and dsx in male courtship. Surprisingly, the system for mate discrimination still works well when all dsx neurons are activated, but is impaired when all fru(M) neurons are activated. Most strikingly, we provide evidence for a fru(M)-independent courtship pathway that is primarily vision dependent.",2011,"Yufeng Pan, Carmen C Robinett, Bruce S Baker"

Drosophila melanogaster Scramblases modulate synaptic transmission,16606691,10.1083/jcb.200506159,"Scramblases are a family of single-pass plasma membrane proteins, identified by their purported ability to scramble phospholipids across the two layers of plasma membrane isolated from platelets and red blood cells. However, their true in vivo role has yet to be elucidated. We report the generation and isolation of null mutants of two Scramblases identified in Drosophila melanogaster. We demonstrate that flies lacking either or both of these Scramblases are not compromised in vivo in processes requiring scrambling of phospholipids. Instead, we show that D. melanogaster lacking both Scramblases have more vesicles and display enhanced recruitment from a reserve pool of vesicles and increased neurotransmitter secretion at the larval neuromuscular synapses. These defects are corrected by the introduction of a genomic copy of the Scramb 1 gene. The lack of phenotypes related to failure of scrambling and the neurophysiological analysis lead us to propose that Scramblases play a modulatory role in the process of neurotransmission.",2006,"Usha Acharya, Michael Beth Edwards, Ramon A Jorquera, Hugo Silva, Kunio Nagashima, Pedro Labarca, Jairaj K Acharya"

We have used Drosophila melanogaster to compare cytologically the frequency of aberrations induced in the cells of somatic ganglia and in the spermatocytes I of males irradiated with 625 R X-rays. The spermatocytes were more sensitive than the gangliar cells to radiation: the aberrations induced in the spermatocytes I were three times more frequent than those induced in the ganglia.

We designed an adhesion test to measure the pull-off force required to detach a pupa from a substrate and to evaluate the contact area covered by the glue. We found that the pupa adheres with similar forces to a variety of substrates (with distinct roughness, hydrophilic and charge properties). We obtained an average pull-off force of 217 mN, corresponding to 15,500 times the weight of a pupa and an adhesion strength of 137-244 kPa.

In a region of 5% of the D. simulans genome introgressed into D. melanogaster, we discover at least six genes of hybrid male sterility and none for female sterility by deficiency mapping. A single case of hybrid inviability has been tracked down to a 3-Kb element that was inserted into the Cyclin E locus during species hybridization.

Natural variation in the strength and direction of male mating preferences for female pheromones in Drosophila melanogaster,24489930,10.1371/journal.pone.0087509,"Many animal species communicate using chemical signals.

This surprising result is consistent with several evolutionary hypotheses but is at odds with other work demonstrating that female CHCs are attractive to males. Here, we investigated natural variation in male preferences for female pheromones using transgenic flies that cannot produce CHCs. By perfuming females with CHCs and performing mate choice tests, we found that some male genotypes prefer females with pheromones, some have no apparent preference, and at least one male genotype prefers females without pheromones.

We discuss the significance of these regions and the maintenance of multiple homologies against the observed high rate of spacer divergence between related Drosophila species. In addition there are two other regions of repetition in the NTS: a 90 base pair periodicity commencing 16 bases downstream from the 3' end of the 28S gene and a number of 340 base pair repeats.

Distinct nutritional and endocrine regulation of prothoracic gland activities underlies divergent life history strategies in Manduca sexta and Drosophila melanogaster,32061770,10.1016/j.ibmb.2020.103335,"Life history trade-offs lead to various strategies that maximize fitness, but the developmental mechanisms underlying these alternative strategies continue to be poorly understood. In insects, trade-offs exist between size and developmental time. Recent studies in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have suggested that the steroidogenic prothoracic glands play a key role in determining the timing of metamorphosis. In this study, the nutrient-dependent growth and transcriptional activation of prothoracic glands were studied in D. melanogaster and the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta. In both species, minimum viable weight (MVW) was associated with activation of ecdysteroid biosynthesis genes and growth of prothoracic gland cells. However, the timing of MVW attainment in M. sexta is delayed by the presence of the sesquiterpenoid hormone, juvenile hormone (JH), whereas in D. melanogaster it is not. Moreover, in D. melanogaster, the transcriptional regulation of ecdysteroidogenesis becomes nutrient-independent at the MVW/critical weight (CW) checkpoint. In contrast, in M. sexta, starvation consistently reduced transcriptional activation of ecdysteroid biosynthesis genes even after CW attainment, indicating that the nature of CW differs fundamentally between the two species. In D. melanogaster, the prothoracic glands dictate the timing of metamorphosis even in the absence of nutritional inputs, whereas in M. sexta, prothoracic gland activity is tightly coupled to the nutritional status of the body, thereby delaying the onset of metamorphosis before CW attainment. We propose that selection for survival under unpredictable nutritional availability leads to the evolution of increased modularity in both morphological and endocrine traits.",2020,"Lily C Xu, Catarina Nunes, Victoria R Wang, Akiho Saito, Teresa Chen, Priyanka Basak, Jane J Chang, Takashi Koyama, Yuichiro Suzuki"
The native Wolbachia endosymbionts of Drosophila melanogaster and Culex quinquefasciatus increase host resistance to West Nile virus infection,20700535,10.1371/journal.pone.0011977,"Background:
      
    

    
      The bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis has been shown to increase host resistance to viral infection in native Drosophila hosts and in the normally Wolbachia-free heterologous host Aedes aegypti when infected by Wolbachia from Drosophila melanogaster or Aedes albopictus. Wolbachia infection has not yet been demonstrated to increase viral resistance in a native Wolbachia-mosquito host system.
    

    
  


        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      In this study, we investigated Wolbachia-induced resistance to West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae) by measuring infection susceptibility in Wolbachia-infected and Wolbachia-free D. melanogaster and Culex quinquefasciatus, a natural mosquito vector of WNV. Wolbachia infection of D. melanogaster induces strong resistance to WNV infection. Wolbachia-infected flies had a 500-fold higher ID50 for WNV and produced 100,000-fold lower virus titers compared to flies lacking Wolbachia. The resistance phenotype was transmitted as a maternal, cytoplasmic factor and was fully reverted in flies cured of Wolbachia. Wolbachia infection had much less effect on the susceptibility of D. melanogaster to Chikungunya (Togaviridae) and La Crosse (Bunyaviridae) viruses. Wolbachia also induces resistance to WNV infection in Cx. quinquefasciatus. While Wolbachia had no effect on the overall rate of peroral infection by WNV, Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes produced lower virus titers and had 2 to 3-fold lower rates of virus transmission compared to mosquitoes lacking Wolbachia.
    

    
  


        Conclusions/significance:
      
    

    
      This is the first demonstration that Wolbachia can increase resistance to arbovirus infection resulting in decreased virus transmission in a native Wolbachia-mosquito system. The results suggest that Wolbachia reduces vector competence in Cx. quinquefasciatus, and potentially in other Wolbachia-infected mosquito vectors.",2010,"Robert L Glaser, Mark A Meola"
Specialized cells tag sexual and species identity in Drosophila melanogaster,19829381,10.1038/nature08495,"Social interactions depend on individuals recognizing each other, and in this context many organisms use chemical signals to indicate species and sex. Cuticular hydrocarbon signals are used by insects, including Drosophila melanogaster, to distinguish conspecific individuals from others. These chemicals also contribute to intraspecific courtship and mating interactions. However, the possibility that sex and species identification are linked by common chemical signalling mechanisms has not been formally tested. Here we provide direct evidence that a single compound is used to communicate female identity among D. melanogaster, and to define a reproductive isolation barrier between D. melanogaster and sibling species. A transgenic manipulation eliminated cuticular hydrocarbons by ablating the oenocytes, specialized cells required for the expression of these chemical signals. The resulting oenocyte-less (oe(-)) females elicited the normal repertoire of courtship behaviours from males, but were actually preferred over wild-type females by courting males. In addition, wild-type males attempted to copulate with oe(-) males. Thus, flies lacking hydrocarbons are a sexual hyperstimulus. Treatment of virgin females with the aversive male pheromone cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) significantly delayed mating of oe(-) females compared to wild-type females. This difference was eliminated when oe(-) females were treated with a blend of cVA and the female aphrodisiac (7Z,11Z)-heptacosadiene (7,11-HD), showing that female aphrodisiac compounds can attenuate the effects of male aversive pheromones. 7,11-HD also was shown to have a crucial role in heterospecific encounters. Specifically, the species barrier was lost because males of other Drosophila species courted oe(-) D. melanogaster females, and D. simulans males consistently mated with them. Treatment of oe(-) females with 7,11-HD restored the species barrier, showing that a single compound can confer species identity. These results identify a common mechanism for sexual and species recognition regulated by cuticular hydrocarbons.",2009,"Jean-Christophe Billeter, Jade Atallah, Joshua J Krupp, Jocelyn G Millar, Joel D Levine"
Improvements of Motor Performances in the Drosophila LRRK2 Loss-of-Function Model of Parkinson's Disease: Effects of Dialyzed Leucocyte Extracts from Human Serum,31947539,10.3390/brainsci10010045,"Within neurodegenerative syndromes, Parkinson's disease (PD) is typically associated with its locomotor defects, sleep disturbances and related dopaminergic (DA) neuron loss. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster), with leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 mutants (LRRK2) loss-of-function in the WD40 domain, provides mechanistic insights into corresponding human behaviour, possibly disclosing some physiopathologic features of PD in both genetic and sporadic forms. Moreover, several data support the boosting impact of innate and adaptive immunity pathways for driving the progression of PD. In this context, human dialyzable leukocyte extracts (DLE) have been extensively used to transfer antigen-specific information that influences the activity of various immune components, including inflammatory cytokines. Hence, the main goal of our study was to ascertain the therapeutic potential of DLE from male and female donors on D. melanogaster LRRK2 loss-of-function, as compared to D. melanogaster wild-type (WT), in terms of rescuing physiological parameters, such as motor and climbing activities, which are severely compromised in the mutant flies. Finally, in search of the anatomical structures responsible for restored functions in parkinsonian-like mutant flies, we found a topographical correlation between improvement of locomotor performances and an increased number of dopaminergic neurons in selective areas of LRRK2 mutant brains.",2020,"Andrea Diana, Maria Collu, Maria Antonietta Casu, Ignazia Mocci, Miguel Aguilar-Santelises, Maria Dolores Setzu"
FlyBase: introduction of the Drosophila melanogaster Release 6 reference genome assembly and large-scale migration of genome annotations,25398896,10.1093/nar/gku1099,"Release 6, the latest reference genome assembly of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, was released by the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project in 2014; it replaces their previous Release 5 genome assembly, which had been the reference genome assembly for over 7 years. With the enormous amount of information now attached to the D. melanogaster genome in public repositories and individual laboratories, the replacement of the previous assembly by the new one is a major event requiring careful migration of annotations and genome-anchored data to the new, improved assembly. In this report, we describe the attributes of the new Release 6 reference genome assembly, the migration of FlyBase genome annotations to this new assembly, how genome features on this new assembly can be viewed in FlyBase (http://flybase.org) and how users can convert coordinates for their own data to the corresponding Release 6 coordinates.",2015,"Gilberto dos Santos, Andrew J Schroeder, Joshua L Goodman, Victor B Strelets, Madeline A Crosby, Jim Thurmond, David B Emmert, William M Gelbart, FlyBase Consortium"
Natural variation in decision-making behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,21283727,10.1371/journal.pone.0016436,"There has been considerable recent interest in using Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the molecular basis of decision-making behavior. Deciding where to place eggs is likely one of the most important decisions for a female fly, as eggs are vulnerable and larvae have limited motility. Here, we show that many natural genotypes of D. melanogaster prefer to lay eggs near nutritious substrate, rather than in nutritious substrate. These preferences are highly polymorphic in both degree and direction, with considerable heritability (0.488) and evolvability.Relative preferences are modulated by the distance between options and the overall concentration of ethanol, suggesting Drosophila integrate many environmental factors when making oviposition decisions. As oviposition-related decisions can be efficiently assessed by simply counting eggs, oviposition behavior is an excellent model for understanding information processing in insects. Associating natural genetic polymorphisms with decision-making variation will shed light on the molecular basis of host choice behavior, the evolutionary maintenance of genetic variation, and the mechanistic nature of preference variation in general.",2011,"Paige M Miller, Julia B Saltz, Veronica A Cochrane, Caitlin M Marcinkowski, Raisa Mobin, Thomas L Turner"
Haplotype test reveals departure from neutrality in a segment of the white gene of Drosophila melanogaster,8601488,,"Restriction map studies previously revealed extensive linkage disequilibria in the transcriptional unit of the white locus in natural Drosophila melanogaster populations. To understand the causes of these disequilibria, we sequenced a 4722-bp region of the white gene from 15 lines of D. melanogaster and 1 line of Drosophila simulans. Statistical tests applied to the entire 4722-bp region do not reject neutrality. In contrast, a test for high-frequency haplotypes (""Haplotype test"") revealed an 834-bp segment, encompassing the 3' end of intron 1 to the 3' end of intron 2, in which the structure of variation deviates significantly from the predictions of a neutral equilibrium model. The variants in this 834-bp segment segregate as single haplotype blocks. We proposed that these unusually large haplotype blocks are due to positive selection on polymorphisms within the white gene, including a replacement polymorphism, Arg-->Leu, within this segment.",1995,"D A Kirby, W Stephan"
A physical map of the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster: cosmid contigs and sequence tagged sites,7789765,,"A physical map of the euchromatic X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster has been constructed by assembling contiguous arrays of cosmids that were selected by screening a library with DNA isolated from microamplified chromosomal divisions. This map, consisting of 893 cosmids, covers approximately 64% of the euchromatic part of the chromosome. In addition, 568 sequence tagged sites (STS), in aggregate representing 120 kb of sequenced DNA, were derived from selected cosmids. Most of these STSs, spaced at an average distance of approximately 35 kb along the euchromatic region of the chromosome, represent DNA tags that can be used as entry points to the fruitfly genome. Furthermore, 42 genes have been placed on the physical map, either through the hybridization of specific probes to the cosmids or through the fact that they were represented among the STSs. These provide a link between the physical and the genetic maps of D. melanogaster. Nine novel genes have been tentatively identified in Drosophila on the basis of matches between STS sequences and sequences from other species.",1995,"E Madueño, G Papagiannakis, G Rimmington, R D Saunders, C Savakis, I Sidén-Kiamos, G Skavdis, L Spanos, J Trenear, P Adam"
Setting up for gastrulation: D. melanogaster,31959292,10.1016/bs.ctdb.2019.11.004,"Drosophila melanogaster embryos develop initially as a syncytium of totipotent nuclei and subsequently, once cellularized, undergo morphogenetic movements associated with gastrulation to generate the three somatic germ layers of the embryo: mesoderm, ectoderm, and endoderm. In this chapter, we focus on the first phase of gastrulation in Drosophila involving patterning of early embryos when cells differentiate their gene expression programs. This patterning process requires coordination of multiple developmental processes including genome reprogramming at the maternal-to-zygotic transition, combinatorial action of transcription factors to support distinct gene expression, and dynamic feedback between this genetic patterning by transcription factors and changes in cell morphology. We discuss the gene regulatory programs acting during patterning to specify the three germ layers, which involve the regulation of spatiotemporal gene expression coupled to physical tissue morphogenesis.",2020,"Angelike Stathopoulos, Susan Newcomb"
The Drosophila melanogaster homolog of ribosomal protein S18,8163194,10.1016/0378-1119(94)90577-0,"The sequence of the cDNA encoding the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of the human and rat small-subunit ribosomal protein, S18 (rpS18), is presented. The deduced 152-amino-acid (aa) sequence exhibits 76% identity to that of the human and rat rpS18 (152 aa), and is, like them, a member of the larger rpS13 family which includes archaebacterial, eubacterial and plant mitochondrial (mt) rpS13. The D. melanogaster rpS18 gene is single copy and maps at 56F, a chromosome region encompassing a previously characterised Minute locus, M(2)56F. The rpS18 gene gives rise to a single 700-nucleotide transcript present throughout development. A comparison of the rpS13 family members suggests that conservation is greatest at the N- and C-termini, whilst additional insertions are present in the Drosophila, mammalian and archaebacterial proteins relative to the eubacterial and plant mt proteins.",1994,"J Garwood, J A Lepesant"
Positive and negative DNA elements of the Drosophila grimshawi s18 chorion gene assayed in Drosophila melanogaster,1628750,10.1016/0012-1606(92)90160-i,"Germ line transformation has been used to map the cis regulatory DNA elements responsible for the precise and evolutionarily stable developmental expression of the s18 chorion gene. Constructs containing chimeric combinations of Drosophila melanogaster and D. grimshawi DNA regions, as well as D. grimshawi sequences alone, can direct expression in the follicular epithelium, in an s18-specific temporal and spatial pattern. The results indicate that both positive and negative regulatory elements can function when transferred from D. grimshawi to D. melanogaster. The first ca. 100 bp of the 5'-flanking DNA region constitute a minimal, developmentally regulated promoter, expression of which is inhibited by the next 100-bp DNA segment and activated by positive elements located further upstream. Expression of the minimal promoter can also be enhanced by more distant chorion regulatory elements, provided the inhibitory DNA segment is absent.",1992,"C Swimmer, H Kashevsky, G Mao, F C Kafatos"
Interaction of ribonuclease H from Drosophila melanogaster embryos with DNA polymerase-primase,2997223,,"An RNase H was purified 2,500-fold to near homogeneity from early embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. The purified enzyme has an approximate molecular weight of 180,000 and appears to consist of two 49,000- and two 39,000-dalton polypeptides. The enzyme specifically hydrolyzes RNA.DNA hybrids and releases oligoribonucleotides ranging in size from 2-9 residues. The RNase H can also remove RNA primers that are synthesized and subsequently elongated by the Drosophila polymerase-primase. Preincubation of the RNase H from D. melanogaster embryos with the homologous DNA polymerase-primase results in an increased rate of DNA synthesis. The DNA chains synthesized under these conditions are shorter than those synthesized in the absence of the RNase H, and the rate of primer synthesis is increased significantly. These findings suggest that the RNase H forms a complex with the polymerase-primase, increasing its recycling capacity and thereby increasing the frequency of chain initiation.",1985,"R A DiFrancesco, I R Lehman"
Drosophila as a Model for Developmental Toxicology: Using and Extending the Drosophotoxicology Model,31069673,10.1007/978-1-4939-9182-2_10,"Fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, have been traditionally valued as a simple model system due to their easy and inexpensive culture, their relatively compact genome, and the variety of available genetic tools. However, due to similarities of their neurological and developmental pathways with those of vertebrates, Drosophila also offers advantages for developmental toxicity assays. The ability to distinguish the effects of a toxicant on adult females, males, and the developing offspring adds to the usefulness of this model. Here we describe key techniques to screen chemicals and other potential emerging toxicants such as nanoparticles on adult Drosophila female and male reproductive success. In addition, assessments of relative toxicity can be revealed by viability assays at each developmental stage from the embryo to the pharate, or preemergent, adult.",2019,"Joslynn G Affleck, Virginia K Walker"
Induction of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy by intra- and interspecific transplantation of germ plasm in Drosophila,17246507,,"A new experimental system for inducing mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in Drosophila was developed. By transplanting the germ plasm of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila mauritiana into the posterior pole of the recipient eggs of D. melanogaster, it was possible to introduce foreign mitochondria into the recipient female germline. Heteroplasmic individuals containing both donor and recipient mtDNA were obtained in intra- and interspecific combinations at similar frequencies. The proportion of donor-derived mtDNA in the heteroplasmic individuals varied considerably from individual to individual irrespective of the donor species used. No significant decrease in or elimination of donor mtDNA was observed, and the heteroplasmic state in female germlines persisted for several generations. The present system should serve very much to promote the study and clarification of the transmission genetics of mtDNA in insects.",1989,"E T Matsuura, S I Chigusa, Y Niki"
Intervening sequences in ribosomal RNA genes and bobbed phenotype in Drosophila hydei,7254359,10.1038/292638a0,"The ""bobbed' (bb) mutation in Drosophila is represented phenotypically by shortened and abnormally thin scutellar bristles and by delayed development. There is a direct correlation between bristle size and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis, and the bb mutation was at first explained as a deficiency of rRNA genes (rDNA). However, the bb phenotype can occur in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila hydei with high rDNA content, while phenotypically wild-type flies are known with few rRNA genes, suggesting that what matters is not the number of rRNA genes but their transcriptional activity. In D. melanogaster, it has recently emerged that rRNA genes interrupted by an intervening sequence are not transcribed. We now report that in D. hydei, the length of the scutellar bristle is directly proportional to the number of rRNA genes without this intervening sequence.",1981,"G Franz, W Kunz"
Molecular phylogeny and genome evolution in the Drosophila virilis species group: duplications of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene,8583887,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025551,"Drosophila virilis is a prominent reference species for comparison with Drosophila melanogaster in regard to patterns and mechanisms of molecular and genomic evolution. Sequences were determined for 11 Adh genes from 8 species of the D. virilis species group, including species from both the virilis phylad and the montana subphylad. The genome of D. virilis contains a 6-kb duplication that includes the entire Adh coding region. The pattern of sequence identity within the duplication strongly suggests a recent gene-conversion event bordered by 36-bp indels. As in other Drosophila, the amino-acid coding region of Adh is encoded by three exons interrupted by two short introns. The promoter region includes 16 blocks of sequence that are well conserved in D. virilis, Drosophila hydei, and D. melanogaster. The developmental profile of Adh transcription suggests a distal/proximal promoter switch analogous to that in D. melanogaster. Duplicate Adh genes were also found in Drosophila montana and Drosophila lacicola, which apparently originated independently of that in D. virilis. The Adh genes in all species of the D. virilis group have among the lowest codon bias of any Adh genes so far reported in the genus Drosophila. Taking the low codon bias into account, we estimate the time of divergence between the virilis and montana clades as 9.0 +/- 0.7 Mya and the approximate time of divergence of D. virilis from other members of the virilis phylad as 2.6 +/- 0.4 Mya. The region of the D. virilis genome containing Adh, as well as the chromosome as a whole, gives evidence of extensive rearrangements relative to the genome of D. melanogaster.",1996,"D I Nurminsky, E N Moriyama, E R Lozovskaya, D L Hartl"
A comparison of transplantable bicoid activity and partial bicoid homeobox sequences in several Drosophila and blowfly species (Calliphoridae),28305978,10.1007/BF00539888,"In order to test for bicoid-like activity in insects other than Drosophila melanogaster, anterior egg cytoplasm from the following species was injected into cleavage stage embryos from mutant D. melanogaster lacking a functional bicoid (bcd) product: six other Drosophila species, the housefly, three blowfly species, the primitive cyclorrhaphic dipteran Megaselia, and the honeybee Apis mellifera; preliminary tests were made with four lower dipterans (Nematocera). Rescue effects were only observed with the drosophilids, housefly, and two of the three blowfly species. Rescue was stronger with the drosophilids than with the other flies as donors. Where checked (D. pseudoobscura), a positive correlation was found between the amount of cytoplasm injected and the number of pattern elements formed, suggesting threshold effects upon target genes as with the endogenous bcd product. By polymerase chain reaction, fragments from a bcd-orthologous homeobox were cloned from the three blowfly species. The derived sequence of 43 amino acids was identical in all blowflies and the housefly but differed at 4 positions from the orthologous D. melanogaster sequence. Localization of the mRNA recognized by the respective fragments in the blowflies Lucilia and Phormia resembled that known from D. melanogaster, while Calliphora - the blowfly species lacking rescue activity -showed remarkable differences of localization in both ovarian follicles and the deposited egg cell. This surprising divergence within a morphologically rather uniform family of cyclorrhaphic dipterans should be of interest from both functional and evolutionary points of view.",1993,"R Schröder, K Sander"
Female Drosophila melanogaster respond to song-amplitude modulations,29666051,10.1242/bio.032003,"Males in numerous animal species use mating songs to attract females and intimidate competitors. We demonstrate that modulations in song amplitude are behaviourally relevant in the fruit fly Drosophila We show that Drosophilamelanogaster females prefer amplitude modulations that are typical of melanogaster song over other modulations, which suggests that amplitude modulations are processed auditorily by D. melanogaster Our work demonstrates that receivers can decode messages in amplitude modulations, complementing the recent finding that male flies actively control song amplitude. To describe amplitude modulations, we propose the concept of song amplitude structure (SAS) and discuss similarities and differences to amplitude modulation with distance (AMD).This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",2018,"Birgit Brüggemeier, Mason A Porter, Jim O Vigoreaux, Stephen F Goodwin"
Conservation and de novo acquisition of dosage compensation on newly evolved sex chromosomes in Drosophila,23630075,10.1101/gad.215426.113,"Dosage compensation has arisen in response to the evolution of distinct male (XY) and female (XX) karyotypes. In Drosophila melanogaster, the MSL complex increases male X transcription approximately twofold. X-specific targeting is thought to occur through sequence-dependent binding to chromatin entry sites (CESs), followed by spreading in cis to active genes. We tested this model by asking how newly evolving sex chromosome arms in Drosophila miranda acquired dosage compensation. We found evidence for the creation of new CESs, with the analogous sequence and spacing as in D. melanogaster, providing strong support for the spreading model in the establishment of dosage compensation.",2013,"Artyom A Alekseyenko, Christopher E Ellison, Andrey A Gorchakov, Qi Zhou, Vera B Kaiser, Nick Toda, Zaak Walton, Shouyong Peng, Peter J Park, Doris Bachtrog, Mitzi I Kuroda"

"Conservation of locus-specific microsatellite variability across species: a comparison of two Drosophila sibling species, D. melanogaster and D. simulans",9491614,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025913,"Fifteen microsatellite loci were studied in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, two closely related sibling species which split 2-3.5 MYA. Within-species variances in repeat number were found to differ up to 1,000-fold among individual microsatellite loci. A significant correlation of log variances between both species indicated a locus-specific mutation rate of microsatellites. Hence, locus-specific effects are apparently among the major forces influencing microsatellite variation and deserve more consideration in microsatellite analysis.",1998,"B Harr, B Zangerl, G Brem, C Schlötterer"
Nucleolar dominance and replicative dominance in Drosophila interspecific hybrids,2511070,,"The replication of the rDNA complement of only one nucleolus organizer region during polytene chromosome formation (replicative dominance) was initially observed in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we demonstrate replicative dominance in Drosophila simulans and D. melanogaster/D. simulans interspecific hybrids. A second nucleolar phenomenon, nucleolar dominance, is observed in the diploid tissue of interspecific hybrids. In this case only one of two nucleolus organizer regions forms a nucleolus. However, reorganizations of the X chromosome heterochromatin which eliminate nucleolar dominance have no apparent effect on the expression of replicative dominance. These observations lead us to conclude that nucleolar dominance and replicative dominance are operationally separable functions influencing the rDNAs, and may be determined by differing regulatory events.",1989,"C Goodrich-Young, H M Krider"
Sequences isolated from a Drosophila early-ecdysone puff are expressed in rat liver,6428485,10.1007/BF01122503,"We have studied the presence of a cloned fragment of DNA from Drosophila melanogaster in other organisms by means of nucleic acid hybridization analysis. The isolated region is localized in polytene chromosomes at the 63F subdivision. This region includes a puff that responds within minutes to ecdysone stimulation. We have found that 63F DNA from D. melanogaster hybridizes 'in situ' to both DNA and RNA from D. simulans, D. teissieri, and D. hydei. In all these species the isolated DNA remains associated with one early-ecdysone stimulated puff. The isolated Drosophila recombinant DNA is also complementary to polyadenylated RNA from foetal and adult rat liver but fails to hybridize to the nonpolyadenylated RNA classes from both sources and to polyadenylated RNA from rat mammary glands.",1984,"C Arribas, M Izquierdo"
Visualizing Molecular Functions and Cross-Species Activity of Sex-Peptide in Drosophila,26022240,10.1534/genetics.115.177550,"The Drosophila melanogaster sex-peptide (melSP) is a seminal fluid component that induces postmating responses (PMR) of females via the sex-peptide receptor (SPR) . Although SP orthologs are found in many Drosophila species, their functions remain poorly characterized. It is unknown whether SP functions are conserved across species or rather specific to each species. Here, we developed a GFP-tagged melSP (G-SP) and used it to visualize cross-species binding activity to the female reproductive system of various species. First we demonstrated that ectopically expressed G-SP induced PMR in D. melanogaster females and bound to the female reproductive system, most notably to the common oviduct. No binding occurred in the females lacking SPR, indicating that G-SP binding was dependent on SPR. Next we tested whether G-SP binds to the common oviducts from 11 Drosophila species using dissected reproductive tracts. The binding was observed in six species belonging to the D. melanogaster species group, but not to those outside the group. Injection of melSP reduced the receptivity of females belonging to the D. melanogaster species group, but not of those outside the group, being consistent with the ability to bind G-SP. Thus the SP-mediated PMR appears to be limited to this species group. SPR was expressed in the oviducts at high levels in this group; therefore, we speculate that an enhanced expression of SPR in the oviduct was critical to establish the SP-mediated PMR during evolution.",2015,"Manabu Tsuda, Jean-Baptiste Peyre, Tsunaki Asano, Toshiro Aigaki"
A screen for F1 hybrid male rescue reveals no major-effect hybrid lethality loci in the Drosophila melanogaster autosomal genome,25352540,10.1534/g3.114.014076,"Hybrid sons between Drosophila melanogaster females and D. simulans males die as 3rd instar larvae. Two genes, D. melanogaster Hybrid male rescue (Hmr) on the X chromosome, and D. simulans Lethal hybrid rescue (Lhr) on chromosome II, interact to cause this lethality. Loss-of-function mutations in either gene suppress lethality, but several pieces of evidence suggest that additional factors are required for hybrid lethality. Here we screen the D. melanogaster autosomal genome by using the Bloomington Stock Center Deficiency kit to search for additional regions that can rescue hybrid male lethality. Our screen is designed to identify putative hybrid incompatibility (HI) genes similar to Hmr and Lhr which, when removed, are dominant suppressors of lethality. After screening 89% of the autosomal genome, we found no regions that rescue males to the adult stage. We did, however, identify several regions that rescue up to 13% of males to the pharate adult stage. This weak rescue suggests the presence of multiple minor-effect HI loci, but we were unable to map these loci to high resolution, presumably because weak rescue can be masked by genetic background effects. We attempted to test one candidate, the dosage compensation gene male specific lethal-3 (msl-3), by using RNA interference with short hairpin microRNA constructs targeted specifically against D. simulans msl-3 but failed to achieve knockdown, in part due to off-target effects. We conclude that the D. melanogaster autosomal genome likely does not contain additional major-effect HI loci. We also show that Hmr is insufficient to fully account for the lethality associated with the D. melanogaster X chromosome, suggesting that additional X-linked genes contribute to hybrid lethality.",2014,"Tawny N Cuykendall, P Satyaki, Shuqing Ji, Derek M Clay, Nathaniel B Edelman, Alexandra Kimchy, Ling-Hei Li, Erin A Nuzzo, Neil Parekh, Suna Park, Daniel A Barbash"
