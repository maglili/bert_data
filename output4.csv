Inter- and intra-species variation in genome-wide gene expression of Drosophila in response to parasitoid wasp attack,28449654,10.1186/s12864-017-3697-3,"Background:
      
    

    
      Parasitoid resistance in Drosophila varies considerably, among and within species. An immune response, lamellocyte-mediated encapsulation, evolved in a subclade of Drosophila and was subsequently lost in at least one species within this subclade. While the mechanisms of resistance are fairly well documented in D. melanogaster, much less is known for closely related species. Here, we studied the inter- and intra-species variation in gene expression after parasitoid attack in Drosophila. We used RNA-seq after parasitization of four closely related Drosophila species of the melanogaster subgroup and replicated lines of D. melanogaster experimentally selected for increased resistance to gain insights into short- and long-term evolutionary changes.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We found a core set of genes that are consistently up-regulated after parasitoid attack in the species and lines tested, regardless of their level of resistance. Another set of genes showed no up-regulation or expression in D. sechellia, the species unable to raise an immune response against parasitoids. This set consists largely of genes that are lineage-restricted to the melanogaster subgroup. Artificially selected lines did not show significant differences in gene expression with respect to non-selected lines in their responses to parasitoid attack, but several genes showed differential exon usage.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We showed substantial similarities, but also notable differences, in the transcriptional responses to parasitoid attack among four closely related Drosophila species. In contrast, within D. melanogaster, the responses were remarkably similar. We confirmed that in the short-term, selection does not act on a pre-activation of the immune response. Instead it may target alternative mechanisms such as differential exon usage. In the long-term, we found support for the hypothesis that the ability to immunologically resist parasitoid attack is contingent on new genes that are restricted to the melanogaster subgroup.",2017,"Laura Salazar-Jaramillo, Kirsten M Jalvingh, Ammerins de Haan, Ken Kraaijeveld, Henk Buermans, Bregje Wertheim, Laura Salazar-Jaramillo, Kirsten M Jalvingh, Ammerins de Haan, Ken Kraaijeveld, Henk Buermans, Bregje Wertheim"

Big Lessons from Tiny Flies: Drosophila melanogaster as a Model to Explore Dysfunction of Dopaminergic and Serotonergic Neurotransmitter Systems,29914172,10.3390/ijms19061788,"The brain of Drosophila melanogaster is comprised of some 100,000 neurons, 127 and 80 of which are dopaminergic and serotonergic, respectively. Their activity regulates behavioral functions equivalent to those in mammals, e.g., motor activity, reward and aversion, memory formation, feeding, sexual appetite, etc. Mammalian dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons are known to be heterogeneous. They differ in their projections and in their gene expression profile. A sophisticated genetic tool box is available, which allows for targeting virtually any gene with amazing precision in Drosophila melanogaster. Similarly, Drosophila genes can be replaced by their human orthologs including disease-associated alleles. Finally, genetic manipulation can be restricted to single fly neurons. This has allowed for addressing the role of individual neurons in circuits, which determine attraction and aversion, sleep and arousal, odor preference, etc. Flies harboring mutated human orthologs provide models which can be interrogated to understand the effect of the mutant protein on cell fate and neuronal connectivity. These models are also useful for proof-of-concept studies to examine the corrective action of therapeutic strategies. Finally, experiments in Drosophila can be readily scaled up to an extent, which allows for drug screening with reasonably high throughput.",2018,"Ameya Sanjay Kasture, Thomas Hummel, Sonja Sucic, Michael Freissmuth, Ameya Sanjay Kasture, Thomas Hummel, Sonja Sucic, Michael Freissmuth"
Factors that Differentially Affect Daytime and Nighttime Sleep in Drosophila melanogaster,22375135,10.3389/fneur.2012.00024,"Rest in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has key characteristics of mammalian sleep and is thus considered as a fly version of sleep. Drosophila sleep has been studied extensively, with the aim of gaining fundamental insights into the evolutionarily conserved functions of sleep as well as the mechanisms that regulate it. An interesting question that has not yet been addressed is whether fly sleep can be classified into distinct sleep types, each having particular biological roles - like rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep in birds and mammals. Typically, Drosophila sleep displays a bimodal pattern, consisting of distinct daytime and nighttime components. Notably, daytime and nighttime sleep differ with respect to several qualities, such as sleep-bout lengths and arousal thresholds. In this short review, we describe several genetic and environmental factors that differentially affect daytime and nighttime sleep, highlighting the observations suggesting the notion that these temporally distinct components of Drosophila sleep may have unique biological functions and be regulated by different homeostatic regulatory mechanisms.",2012,"Hiroshi Ishimoto, Arianna Lark, Toshihiro Kitamoto, Hiroshi Ishimoto, Arianna Lark, Toshihiro Kitamoto"

Lineage-specific expansion of the zinc finger associated domain ZAD,17569752,10.1093/molbev/msm121,"The zinc finger associated domain (ZAD), present in almost 100 distinct proteins, characterizes the largest subgroup of C2H2 zinc finger proteins in Drosophila melanogaster and was initially found to be encoded by arthropod genomes only. Here, we report that the ZAD was also present in the last common ancestor of arthropods and vertebrates, and that vertebrate genomes contain a single conserved gene that codes for a ZAD-like peptide. Comparison of the ZAD proteomes of several arthropod species revealed an extensive and species-specific expansion of ZAD-coding genes in higher holometabolous insects, and shows that only few ZAD-coding genes with essential functions in Drosophila melanogaster are conserved. Furthermore, at least 50% of the ZAD-coding genes of Drosophila melanogaster are expressed in the female germline, suggesting a function in oocyte development and/or a requirement during early embryogenesis. Since the majority of the essential ZAD coding genes of Drosophila melanogaster were not conserved during arthropod or at least during insect evolution, we propose that the LSE of ZAD-coding genes shown here may provide the raw material for the evolution of new functions that allow organisms to pursue novel evolutionary paths.",2007,"Ho-Ryun Chung, Ulrike Löhr, Herbert Jäckle, Ho-Ryun Chung, Ulrike Löhr, Herbert Jäckle"

We synthesize evidence for sexually dimorphic responses to bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. Dimorphisms may be mediated by distinct immune compartments, and we review work on sex differences in behavioral, epithelial, cellular, and systemic (fat body-mediated) immunity.

Functional evolution of cis-regulatory modules at a homeotic gene in Drosophila,19893611,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000709,"It is a long-held belief in evolutionary biology that the rate of molecular evolution for a given DNA sequence is inversely related to the level of functional constraint. This belief holds true for the protein-coding homeotic (Hox) genes originally discovered in Drosophila melanogaster. Expression of the Hox genes in Drosophila embryos is essential for body patterning and is controlled by an extensive array of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). How the regulatory modules functionally evolve in different species is not clear. A comparison of the CRMs for the Abdominal-B gene from different Drosophila species reveals relatively low levels of overall sequence conservation. However, embryonic enhancer CRMs from other Drosophila species direct transgenic reporter gene expression in the same spatial and temporal patterns during development as their D. melanogaster orthologs. Bioinformatic analysis reveals the presence of short conserved sequences within defined CRMs, representing gap and pair-rule transcription factor binding sites. One predicted binding site for the gap transcription factor KRUPPEL in the IAB5 CRM was found to be altered in Superabdominal (Sab) mutations. In Sab mutant flies, the third abdominal segment is transformed into a copy of the fifth abdominal segment. A model for KRUPPEL-mediated repression at this binding site is presented. These findings challenge our current understanding of the relationship between sequence evolution at the molecular level and functional activity of a CRM. While the overall sequence conservation at Drosophila CRMs is not distinctive from neighboring genomic regions, functionally critical transcription factor binding sites within embryonic enhancer CRMs are highly conserved. These results have implications for understanding mechanisms of gene expression during embryonic development, enhancer function, and the molecular evolution of eukaryotic regulatory modules.",2009,"Margaret C W Ho, Holly Johnsen, Sara E Goetz, Benjamin J Schiller, Esther Bae, Diana A Tran, Andrey S Shur, John M Allen, Christoph Rau, Welcome Bender, William W Fisher, Susan E Celniker, Robert A Drewell, Margaret C W Ho, Holly Johnsen, Sara E Goetz, Benjamin J Schiller, Esther Bae, Diana A Tran, Andrey S Shur, John M Allen, Christoph Rau, Welcome Bender, William W Fisher, Susan E Celniker, Robert A Drewell"
About the origin of retroviruses and the co-evolution of the gypsy retrovirus with the Drosophila flamenco host gene,9440256,,"The gypsy element of Drosophila melanogaster is the first retrovirus identified so far in invertebrates. According to phylogenetic data, gypsy belongs to the same group as the Ty3 class of LTR-retrotransposons, which suggests that retroviruses evolved from this kind of retroelements before the radiation of vertebrates. There are other invertebrate retroelements that are also likely to be endogenous retroviruses because they share with gypsy some structural and functional retroviral-like characteristics. Gypsy is controlled by a Drosophila gene called flamenco, the restrictive alleles of which maintain the retrovirus in a repressed state. In permissive strains, functional gypsy elements transpose at high frequency and produce infective particles. Defective gypsy proviruses located in pericentromeric heterochromatin of all strains seem to be very old components of the genome of Drosophila melanogaster, which indicates that gypsy invaded this species, or an ancestor, a long time ago. At that time, Drosophila melanogaster presumably contained permissive alleles of the flamenco gene. One can imagine that the species survived to the increase of genetic load caused by the retroviral invasion because restrictive alleles of flamenco were selected. The characterization of a retrovirus in Drosophila, one of the most advanced model organisms for molecular genetics, provides us with an exceptional clue to study how a species can resist a retroviral invasion.",1997,"A Pélisson, L Teysset, F Chalvet, A Kim, N Prud'homme, C Terzian, A Bucheton, A Pélisson, L Teysset, F Chalvet, A Kim, N Prud'homme, C Terzian, A Bucheton"
Correlation of guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase activity and the synthesis of pterins in Drosophila melanogaster,822835,10.1007/BF00484766,"The enzyme guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase (GTP cyclohydrolase), which in bacteria is known to be the first enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway for the synthesis of pteridines, has been discovered in extracts of Drosophila melanogaster. Most of the enzyme (80%) is located in the head of the adult fly. An analysis of enzyme activity during development in Drosophila has revealed the presence of a relatively small peak of activity at pupariation and a much larger peak that appears at about the time of eclosion. Enzyme activity declines radidly as the fly ages. Analysis for the production of the typical pteridine pigments of Drosophila have indicated that the small peak of GTP cyclohydrolase activity evident at pupariation coincides with the appearance of isoxanthopterin, sepiapterin, and pterin, and the larger peak at eclosion roughly corresponds to the accumulation of drospterin as well as to the appearence in larger amounts of pterin and sepiaterin. These observations strongly suggest that in Drosophila, like bacteria, GTP cyclohydrolase is involved in the biosynthesis of pteridines. Analyses of a variety of zeste mutants of Drosophila melanogaster have shown that these mutants all contain GTP cyclohydrolase equal approximately to the amount found in the wild-type fly.

The initiator tRNA genes of Drosophila melanogaster: evidence for a tRNA pseudogene,6273811,10.1093/nar/9.22.5867,"We have isolated four segments of Drosophila melanogaster DNA that hybridize to homologous initiator tRNAMet. Three of the cloned fragments contain initiator tRNA genes, each of which can be transcribed in vitro. The fourth clone, pPW568, contains an initiator tRNA pseudogene which is not transcribed in vitro by RNA polymerase III. The pseudogene is contained in a 1.15 kb DNA fragment. This fragment has the characteristics of dispersed repetitive DNA and hybridizes in situ to at least 30 sites in the Drosophila genome. The arrangement of the initiator tRNA genes we have isolated, is different to that of other Drosophila tRNA gene families. The initiator tRNA genes are not clustered nor intermingled with other tRNA genes. They occur as single copies within an approximately 415-bp repeat segment, which is separated from other initiator tRNA genes by a mean distance of 17 kb. In situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes localizes these genes to the 61D region of the Drosophila genome.

We test this idea using experimental evolution in Drosophila melanogaster. We maintained replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster under male (M) and female (F) biased sex ratio regimes for more than a hundred generations with the result that males from the M regime evolved higher sperm competitive abilities relative to males from the F regime. In the present study, we measured the testes and the accessory gland size of virgin and singly mated males from the M and F regimes. The M and F males do not differ in either testis or accessory gland size. Additionally, ejaculate investment is not different in the M and F males, as measured by reduction in testis and accessory gland sizes. Thus, contrary to theoretical prediction and evidence from other species, we found that evolved differences in sperm competitive ability are not necessarily due to evolution of testis/accessory gland size or strategic ejaculate investment in these populations.",2017,"Tejinder Singh Chechi, Zeeshan Ali Syed, Nagaraj Guru Prasad, Tejinder Singh Chechi, Zeeshan Ali Syed, Nagaraj Guru Prasad"
Quantitative Bioimaging to Investigate the Uptake of Mercury Species in Drosophila melanogaster,26424032,10.1021/acs.analchem.5b02500,"The uptake of mercury species in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster was investigated by elemental bioimaging using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS). The mercury distribution in Drosophila melanogaster was analyzed for the three species mercury(II) chloride, methylmercury chloride, and thimerosal after intoxication. A respective analytical method was developed and applied to the analysis of the entire Drosophila melanogaster first, before a particular focus was directed to the cerebral areas of larvae and adult flies. For quantification of mercury, matrix-matched standards based on gelatin were prepared. Challenges of spatially dissolved mercury determination, namely, strong evaporation issues of the analytes and an inhomogeneous distribution of mercury in the standards due to interactions with cysteine containing proteins of the gelatin were successfully addressed by complexation with meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). No mercury was detected in the cerebral region for mercury(II) chloride, whereas both organic species showed the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Quantitatively, the mercury level in the brain exceeded the fed concentration indicating mercury enrichment, which was approximately 3 times higher for methylmercury chloride than for thimerosal.",2015,"Ann-Christin Niehoff, Oliver Bolle Bauer, Sabrina Kröger, Stefanie Fingerhut, Jacqueline Schulz, Sören Meyer, Michael Sperling, Astrid Jeibmann, Tanja Schwerdtle, Uwe Karst, Ann-Christin Niehoff, Oliver Bolle Bauer, Sabrina Kröger, Stefanie Fingerhut, Jacqueline Schulz, Sören Meyer, Michael Sperling, Astrid Jeibmann, Tanja Schwerdtle, Uwe Karst"
Metabolic aspects of phenolic compounds from Triplaris gardneriana seeds in the management of oxidative stress,32393135,10.1080/03639045.2020.1767126,"Objective: Considering the limited number of studies that analyze the behavior of plant preparations in human body, this study aimed to characterize the phenolic compounds from Triplaris gardneriana extract (EETg) in terms of antioxidant and metabolic aspects, integrating in vitro, in silico and in vivo strategies.Methods: EETg was analyzed in relation to polyphenols release from the plant matrix under in vitro digestion, as well as the pharmacokinetic prediction of their major compounds by in silico simulation and understanding of its in vivo antioxidant effect in an alternative animal model.Results: About 35.22% of polyphenols from EETg proved to be accessible after enzymatic hydrolysis. A kinetics study showed that 40% of the total content of these phytochemicals was released from the extract accompanied by increased antioxidant capacity after 180 min of gastrointestinal simulation. A computational approach revealed that 7 out of 9 major phenolic compounds of EETg showed good pharmacokinetic parameters such as intestinal absorption and bioavailability score. In addition, the extract showed a protective effect on copper-induced oxidative stress in Drosophila melanogaster, evidenced by the restoration of basal levels of thiol and malondialdehyde contents. These biochemical observations were supported by the examination of histological features of D. melanogaster brain.Conclusion: It was demonstrated that the oral administration of EETg would provide phenolic compounds partially absorbable by the human gut and capable of providing health benefits associated with the inhibition of oxidative stress.

Stage-specific testes proteomics of Drosophila melanogaster identifies essential proteins for male fertility,30679029,10.1016/j.ejcb.2019.01.001,"Spermiogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster is a highly conserved process and essential for male fertility. In this haploid phase of spermatogenesis, motile sperm are assembled from round cells, and flagella and needle-shaped nuclei with highly compacted genomes are formed. As transcription takes place mainly in spermatocytes and transcripts relevant for post-meiotic sperm development are translationally repressed for days, we comparatively analysed the proteome of larval testes (only germ cell stages before meiotic divisions), testes of 1-2-day-old pupae (germ cell stages before meiotic divisions, meiotic and early spermatid stages) and adult flies (germ cell stages before meiotic divisions, meiotic and early spermatid stages, late spermatids and sperm). We identified 6,171 proteins; 61 proteins were detected solely in one stage and are thus enriched, namely 34 in larval testes, 77 in pupal testes and 214 in adult testes. To substantiate our mass spectrometric data, we analysed the stage-specific synthesis and importance for male fertility of a number of uncharacterized proteins. For example, Mst84B (gene CG1988), a very basic cysteine- and lysine-rich nuclear protein and was present in the transition phase from a histone-based to a protamine-based chromatin structure. CG6332 encodes d-Theg, which is related to the mouse tHEG and human THEG proteins. Mutants of d-Theg were sterile due to the lack of sperm in the seminal vesicles.

Calmodulin Affects Sensitization of Drosophila melanogaster Odorant Receptors,26903813,10.3389/fncel.2016.00028,"Flying insects have developed a remarkably sensitive olfactory system to detect faint and turbulent odor traces. This ability is linked to the olfactory receptors class of odorant receptors (ORs), occurring exclusively in winged insects. ORs form heteromeric complexes of an odorant specific receptor protein (OrX) and a highly conserved co-receptor protein (Orco). The ORs form ligand gated ion channels that are tuned by intracellular signaling systems. Repetitive subthreshold odor stimulation of olfactory sensory neurons sensitizes insect ORs. This OR sensitization process requires Orco activity. In the present study we first asked whether OR sensitization can be monitored with heterologously expressed OR proteins. Using electrophysiological and calcium imaging methods we demonstrate that D. melanogaster OR proteins expressed in CHO cells show sensitization upon repeated weak stimulation. This was found for OR channels formed by Orco as well as by Or22a or Or56a and Orco. Moreover, we show that inhibition of calmodulin (CaM) action on OR proteins, expressed in CHO cells, abolishes any sensitization. Finally, we investigated the sensitization phenomenon using an ex vivo preparation of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing Or22a inside the fly's antenna. Using calcium imaging, we observed sensitization in the dendrites as well as in the soma. Inhibition of calmodulin with W7 disrupted the sensitization within the outer dendritic shaft, whereas the sensitization remained in the other OSN compartments. Taken together, our results suggest that CaM action is involved in sensitizing the OR complex and that this mechanisms accounts for the sensitization in the outer dendrites, whereas further mechanisms contribute to the sensitization observed in the other OSN compartments. The use of heterologously expressed OR proteins appears to be suitable for further investigations on the mechanistic basis of OR sensitization, while investigations on native neurons are required to study the presently unknown additional mechanisms involved in OSN sensitization.",2016,"Latha Mukunda, Fabio Miazzi, Vardanush Sargsyan, Bill S Hansson, Dieter Wicher, Latha Mukunda, Fabio Miazzi, Vardanush Sargsyan, Bill S Hansson, Dieter Wicher"
Novel genetic capacitors and potentiators for the natural genetic variation of sensory bristles and their trait specificity in Drosophila melanogaster,26441383,10.1111/mec.13407,"Cryptic genetic variation (CGV) is defined as the genetic variation that has little effect on phenotypic variation under a normal condition, but contributes to heritable variation under environmental or genetic perturbations. Genetic buffering systems that suppress the expression of CGV and store it in a population are called genetic capacitors, and the opposite systems are called genetic potentiators. One of the best-known candidates for a genetic capacitor and potentiator is the molecular chaperone protein, HSP90, and one of its characteristics is that it affects the genetic variation in various morphological traits. However, it remains unclear whether the wide-ranging effects of HSP90 on a broad range of traits are a general feature of genetic capacitors and potentiators. In the current study, I searched for novel genetic capacitors and potentiators for quantitative bristle traits of Drosophila melanogaster and then investigated the trait specificity of their genetic buffering effect. Three bristle traits of D. melanogaster were used as the target traits, and the genomic regions with genetic buffering effects were screened using the 61 genomic deficiencies examined previously for genetic buffering effects in wing shape. As a result, four and six deficiencies with significant effects on increasing and decreasing the broad-sense heritability of the bristle traits were identified, respectively. Of the 18 deficiencies with significant effects detected in the current study and/or by the previous study, 14 showed trait-specific effects, and four affected the genetic buffering of both bristle traits and wing shape. This suggests that most genetic capacitors and potentiators exert trait-specific effects, but that general capacitors and potentiators with effects on multiple traits also exist.",2015,"Kazuo H Takahashi, Kazuo H Takahashi"

In vivo detection of DNA adducts induced by cisplatin using capillary HPLC-ICP-MS and their correlation with genotoxic damage in Drosophila melanogaster,17932658,10.1007/s00216-007-1634-z,"The antitumoral effect of cisplatin [cis-diamminodichloroplatinum(II)] in mammals is related to its binding to DNA components. However, there is a lack of specific chemical methods to selectively detect those adducts formed in vivo at low concentrations. In this work, a new sensitive and selective method of determining cisplatin-DNA adducts based on the use of element-selective mass spectrometry is proposed, and the method is then applied to detect cisplatin adducts induced in vivo in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster. The bioanalytical strategy proposed here allows the determination of the most important DNA adduct formed between adjacent guanine units of the same DNA strand with cisplatin, and it is based on the coupling of capillary liquid chromatography (cap-LC) to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). This set-up allows the simultaneous monitoring of the Pt (from the drug) and P (from the DNA components) present in these adducts, once they have been cleaved by enzymatic hydrolysis of the DNA samples. Using this instrumental set-up, the adducts of cisplatin formed in vivo when D. melanogaster flies are exposed to different cisplatin concentrations can be detected and their concentration determined. The results obtained show a direct correlation between the concentration of cisplatin adducts, the induced genotoxic damage (measured as DNA strand breaks using the Comet assay) and the cisplatin concentration.

Vibrio cholerae infection of Drosophila melanogaster mimics the human disease cholera,16201020,10.1371/journal.ppat.0010008,"Cholera, the pandemic diarrheal disease caused by the gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae, continues to be a major public health challenge in the developing world. Cholera toxin, which is responsible for the voluminous stools of cholera, causes constitutive activation of adenylyl cyclase, resulting in the export of ions into the intestinal lumen. Environmental studies have demonstrated a close association between V. cholerae and many species of arthropods including insects. Here we report the susceptibility of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to oral V. cholerae infection through a process that exhibits many of the hallmarks of human disease: (i) death of the fly is dependent on the presence of cholera toxin and is preceded by rapid weight loss; (ii) flies harboring mutant alleles of either adenylyl cyclase, Gsalpha, or the Gardos K channel homolog SK are resistant to V. cholerae infection; and (iii) ingestion of a K channel blocker along with V. cholerae protects wild-type flies against death. In mammals, ingestion of as little as 25 mug of cholera toxin results in massive diarrhea. In contrast, we found that ingestion of cholera toxin was not lethal to the fly. However, when cholera toxin was co-administered with a pathogenic strain of V. cholerae carrying a chromosomal deletion of the genes encoding cholera toxin, death of the fly ensued. These findings suggest that additional virulence factors are required for intoxication of the fly that may not be essential for intoxication of mammals. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time the mechanism of action of cholera toxin in a whole organism and the utility of D. melanogaster as an accurate, inexpensive model for elucidation of host susceptibility to cholera.",2005,"Nathan S Blow, Robert N Salomon, Kerry Garrity, Isabelle Reveillaud, Alan Kopin, F Rob Jackson, Paula I Watnick, Nathan S Blow, Robert N Salomon, Kerry Garrity, Isabelle Reveillaud, Alan Kopin, F Rob Jackson, Paula I Watnick"

Glyphosate-based herbicide exposure causes antioxidant defence responses in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,26980113,10.1016/j.cbpc.2016.03.006,"Glyphosate is a non-selective and post-emergent herbicide that affects plant growth. Animal exposure to this herbicide can lead to adverse effects, such as endocrine disruption, oxidative stress and behavioural disorders. Drosophilids have been utilized previously as an effective tool in toxicological tests. In the present study, the effects of a glyphosate-based herbicide (Roundup [Original]) were investigated regarding oxidative stress, the antioxidant defence system and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in Drosophila melanogaster. Flies (of both genders) that were 1 to 3days old were exposed to different glyphosate concentrations (0.0g/L=control, 1.0g/L, 2.0g/L, 5.0g/L and 10.0g/L) [corrected] in the diet for 24h and 96h. After the exposure periods, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were quantified. In addition, the mRNA expression of antioxidant genes (i.e., keap1, sod, sod2, cat, irc, gclc, gclm, gss, trxt, trxr-1 and trxr-2) was evaluated via RT-PCR. Additionally, AChE activity was evaluated only after the 96h exposure period. The results indicated that Roundup exposure leads to a reduction in ROS levels in flies exposed for 96h. ACAP levels and gene expression of the antioxidant defence system exhibited an increase from 24h, while LPO did not show any significant alterations in both exposure periods. AChE activity was not affected following Roundup exposure.

Population Genomics of sub-saharan Drosophila melanogaster: African diversity and non-African admixture,23284287,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003080,"Drosophila melanogaster has played a pivotal role in the development of modern population genetics. However, many basic questions regarding the demographic and adaptive history of this species remain unresolved. We report the genome sequencing of 139 wild-derived strains of D. melanogaster, representing 22 population samples from the sub-Saharan ancestral range of this species, along with one European population. Most genomes were sequenced above 25X depth from haploid embryos. Results indicated a pervasive influence of non-African admixture in many African populations, motivating the development and application of a novel admixture detection method. Admixture proportions varied among populations, with greater admixture in urban locations. Admixture levels also varied across the genome, with localized peaks and valleys suggestive of a non-neutral introgression process. Genomes from the same location differed starkly in ancestry, suggesting that isolation mechanisms may exist within African populations. After removing putatively admixed genomic segments, the greatest genetic diversity was observed in southern Africa (e.g. Zambia), while diversity in other populations was largely consistent with a geographic expansion from this potentially ancestral region. The European population showed different levels of diversity reduction on each chromosome arm, and some African populations displayed chromosome arm-specific diversity reductions. Inversions in the European sample were associated with strong elevations in diversity across chromosome arms. Genomic scans were conducted to identify loci that may represent targets of positive selection within an African population, between African populations, and between European and African populations. A disproportionate number of candidate selective sweep regions were located near genes with varied roles in gene regulation. Outliers for Europe-Africa F(ST) were found to be enriched in genomic regions of locally elevated cosmopolitan admixture, possibly reflecting a role for some of these loci in driving the introgression of non-African alleles into African populations.",2012,"John E Pool, Russell B Corbett-Detig, Ryuichi P Sugino, Kristian A Stevens, Charis M Cardeno, Marc W Crepeau, Pablo Duchen, J J Emerson, Perot Saelao, David J Begun, Charles H Langley, John E Pool, Russell B Corbett-Detig, Ryuichi P Sugino, Kristian A Stevens, Charis M Cardeno, Marc W Crepeau, Pablo Duchen, J J Emerson, Perot Saelao, David J Begun, Charles H Langley"
Term-tissue specific models for prediction of gene ontology biological processes using transcriptional profiles of aging in drosophila melanogaster,18307794,10.1186/1471-2105-9-129,"Background:
      
    

    
      Predictive classification on the base of gene expression profiles appeared recently as an attractive strategy for identifying the biological functions of genes. Gene Ontology (GO) provides a valuable source of knowledge for model training and validation. The increasing collection of microarray data represents a valuable source for generating functional hypotheses of uncharacterized genes.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      This study focused on using support vector machines (SVM) to predict GO biological processes from individual or multiple-tissue transcriptional profiles of aging in Drosophila melanogaster. Ten-fold cross validation was implemented to evaluate the prediction. One-tail Fisher's exact test was conducted on each cross validation and multiple testing was addressed using BH FDR procedure. The results showed that, of the 148 pursued GO biological processes, fifteen terms each had at least one model with FDR-adjusted p-value (Adj.p) <0.05 and six had the values between 0.05 and 0.25. Furthermore, all these models had the prediction sensitivity (SN) over 30% and specificity (SP) over 80%.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We proposed the concept of term-tissue specific models indicating the fact that the major part of the optimized prediction models was trained from individual tissue data. Furthermore, we observed that the memberships of the genes involved in all the three pursued children biological processes on mitochondrial electron transport could be predicted from the transcriptional profiles of aging (Adj.p < 0.01). This finding may be important in biology because the genes of mitochondria play a critical role in the longevity of C. elegans and D. melanogaster.",2008,"Wensheng Zhang, Sige Zou, Jiuzhou Song, Wensheng Zhang, Sige Zou, Jiuzhou Song"
Selection on the timing of adult emergence results in altered circadian clocks in fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster,17297149,10.1242/jeb.001354,"To investigate whether circadian clocks in fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster evolve as a consequence of selection on the timing of adult emergence, we raised four replicate populations each of early (early(1..4)) and late (late(1..4)) emerging flies by selecting for adults that emerged during the morning and the evening hours. We estimated the percentage of flies that emerged during the two selection windows to evaluate the direct response to selection, and the circadian phenotypes of adult emergence and locomotor activity rhythms under light/dark (LD) and constant darkness (DD) to assess the correlated response to selection. After 55 generations, the percentage of flies emerging during the morning window increased in the early populations, but decreased in the late populations. The percentage of flies emerging during the evening window increased in the late populations, but decreased in the early populations. The time course and waveform of emergence and locomotor activity rhythms of the selected populations diverged from each other as well as from the controls. Further, the circadian periodicity of the early populations was significantly shorter than the controls, while that of the late populations was significantly longer than the controls. The light-induced phase response curve of the selected populations differed significantly within groups as well as from the controls. Such modifications in the circadian phenotypes of the selected populations due to heritable changes in genetic architecture, in response to imposed selection pressure, suggest that the circadian clocks underlying emergence and locomotor activity rhythms in D. melanogaster evolve as a correlated response to selection on the timing of adult emergence.",2007,"Shailesh Kumar, Dhanya Kumar, Dhanashree A Paranjpe, Akarsh C R, Vijay Kumar Sharma, Shailesh Kumar, Dhanya Kumar, Dhanashree A Paranjpe, Akarsh C R, Vijay Kumar Sharma"
Positive and negative selection in the beta-esterase gene cluster of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup,16547641,10.1007/s00239-005-0140-1,"We examine the pattern of molecular evolution of the beta-esterase gene cluster, including the Est-6 and psiEst-6 genes, in eight species of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. Using maximum likelihood estimates of nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratios, we show that the majority of Est-6 sites evolves under strong (48% of sites) or moderate (50% of sites) negative selection and a minority of sites (1.5%) is under significant positive selection. Est-6 sites likely to be under positive selection are associated with increased intraspecific variability. One positively selected site is responsible for the EST-6 F/S allozyme polymorphism; the same site is responsible for the EST-6 functional divergence between species of the melanogaster subgroup. For psiEst-6 83.7% sites evolve under negative selection, 16% sites evolve neutrally, and 0.3% sites are under positive selection. The positively selected sites of psiEst-6 are located at the beginning and at the end of the gene, where there is reduced divergence between D. melanogaster and D. simulans; these regions of psiEst-6 could be involved in regulation or some other function. Branch-site-specific analysis shows that the evolution of the melanogaster subgroup underwent episodic positive selection. Collating the present data with previous results for the beta-esterase genes, we propose that positive and negative selection are involved in a complex relationship that may be typical of the divergence of duplicate genes as one or both duplicates evolve a new function.",2006,"Evgeniy S Balakirev, Maria Anisimova, Francisco J Ayala, Evgeniy S Balakirev, Maria Anisimova, Francisco J Ayala"
Quantitative trait loci responsible for variation in sexually dimorphic traits in Drosophila melanogaster,12618413,,"To understand the mechanisms of morphological evolution and species divergence, it is essential to elucidate the genetic basis of variation in natural populations. Sexually dimorphic characters, which evolve rapidly both within and among species, present attractive models for addressing these questions. In this report, we map quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for variation in sexually dimorphic traits (abdominal pigmentation and the number of ventral abdominal bristles and sex comb teeth) in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster. To capture the pattern of genetic variation present in the wild, a panel of recombinant inbred lines was created from two heterozygous flies taken directly from nature. High-resolution mapping was made possible by cytological markers at the average density of one per 2 cM. We have used a new Bayesian algorithm that allows QTL mapping based on all markers simultaneously. With this approach, we were able to detect small-effect QTL that were not evident in single-marker analyses. Our results show that at least for some sexually dimorphic traits, a small number of QTL account for the majority of genetic variation. The three strongest QTL account for >60% of variation in the number of ventral abdominal bristles. Strikingly, a single QTL accounts for almost 60% of variation in female abdominal pigmentation. This QTL maps to the chromosomal region that Robertson et al. have found to affect female abdominal pigmentation in other populations of D. melanogaster. Using quantitative complementation tests, we demonstrate that this QTL is allelic to the bric a brac gene, whose expression has previously been shown to correlate with interspecific differences in pigmentation. Multiple bab alleles that confer distinct phenotypes appear to segregate in natural populations at appreciable frequencies, suggesting that intraspecific and interspecific variation in abdominal pigmentation may share a similar genetic basis.",2003,"Artyom Kopp, Rita M Graze, Shizhong Xu, Sean B Carroll, Sergey V Nuzhdin, Artyom Kopp, Rita M Graze, Shizhong Xu, Sean B Carroll, Sergey V Nuzhdin"
The kl-3 loop of the Y chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster binds a tektin-like protein,8454204,,"Primary spermatocyte nuclei of Drosophila melanogaster exhibit three giant lampbrush-like loops formed by the kl-5, kl-3 and ks-1 Y-chromosome fertility factors. These structures contain and abundantly transcribe highly repetitive, simple sequence DNAs and accumulate large amounts of non-Y-encoded proteins. By immunizing mice with the 53-kD fraction (enriched in beta 2-tubulin) excised from a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel loaded with Drosophila testis proteins we raised a polyclonal antibody, designated as T53-1, which decorates the kl-3 loop and the sperm flagellum. Two dimensional immunoblot analysis showed that the T53-1 antibody reacts with a single protein of about 53 kD, different from the tubulins and present both in X/Y and X/O males. Moreover, the antigen recognized by the T53-1 antibody proved to be testis-specific because it was detected in testes and seminal vesicles but not in other male tissues or in females. The characteristics of the protein recognized by the T53-1 antibody suggested that it might be a member of a class of axonemal proteins, the tektins, known to form Sarkosyl-urea insoluble filaments in the wall of flagellar microtubules. Purification of the Sarkosyl-urea insoluble fraction of D. melanogaster sperm revealed that it contains four polypeptides having molecular masses ranging from 51 to 57 kD. One of these polypeptides reacts strongly with the T53-1 antibody but none of them reacts with antitubulin antibodies. These results indicate that the kl-3 loop binds a non-Y encoded, testis-specific, tektin-like protein which is a constituent of the sperm flagellum. This finding supports the hypothesis that the Y loops fulfill a protein-binding function required for the proper assembly of the axoneme components.",1993,"C Pisano, S Bonaccorsi, M Gatti, C Pisano, S Bonaccorsi, M Gatti"
Y chromosome loops in Drosophila melanogaster,2465201,,"Primary spermatocyte nuclei of fixed testes of Drosophila melanogaster exhibit three large clusters of thread-like structures, each consisting of two long, continuous, loop-shaped filaments. No comparable intranuclear structures are observed in spermatogonia, secondary spermatocytes or spermatids. The threads begin to form in young spermatocytes, grow throughout spermatocyte development, reach their maximum size in mature spermatocytes and disintegrate prior to meiotic metaphase I. The presence of each cluster of threads depends upon the presence of a specific region of the Y chromosome; when this region is deleted the cluster is absent, and when it is duplicated the cluster is also duplicated. Together these observations strongly suggest that these structures represent giant Y chromosome lampbrush-like loops analogous to those described in Drosophila hydei. Two antibodies, one polyclonal and one monoclonal, differentially react with the three loops of D. melanogaster. Moreover, two of these loops are specifically stained by Giemsa at pH 10. By indirect immunofluorescence with these antibodies followed by Giemsa staining, each loop can be unambiguously identified and its presence and normality readily assessed. This enabled us to perform fine mapping experiments to determine the relationships between the Y chromosome fertility factors and the loops. The loop-forming sites map within the kl-5, kl-3 and ks-1 fertility factors. Regions h3 and h21 of the Y chromosome correspond to the loop-forming sites of kl-5 and ks-1, respectively. Each of these regions contains about 1300 kb of DNA and spans about one-third of its locus. The loop-forming site of the kl-3 locus is coextensive with region h7-h9 which contains about 4300 kb of DNA and corresponds to the minimum physical size of this locus. These data suggest that each loop is an integral part of a different fertility factor, representing the cytological manifestation of its activity in primary spermatocytes. The kl-2, kl-1 and ks-2 fertility regions do not produce any visible intranuclear structure and do not affect the kl-5, kl-3 and ks-1 loops. Thus, these loci may either not form loops at all or produce loop-like structures that we are unable to see because they are physically minute, destroyed by our fixation procedure, or both.",1988,"S Bonaccorsi, C Pisano, F Puoti, M Gatti, S Bonaccorsi, C Pisano, F Puoti, M Gatti"

Cold acclimation wholly reorganizes the Drosophila melanogaster transcriptome and metabolome,27357258,10.1038/srep28999,"Cold tolerance is a key determinant of insect distribution and abundance, and thermal acclimation can strongly influence organismal stress tolerance phenotypes, particularly in small ectotherms like Drosophila. However, there is limited understanding of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms that confer such impressive plasticity. Here, we use high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to compare the transcriptomes and metabolomes of D. melanogaster acclimated as adults to warm (rearing) (21.5 °C) or cold conditions (6 °C). Cold acclimation improved cold tolerance and led to extensive biological reorganization: almost one third of the transcriptome and nearly half of the metabolome were differentially regulated. There was overlap in the metabolic pathways identified via transcriptomics and metabolomics, with proline and glutathione metabolism being the most strongly-supported metabolic pathways associated with increased cold tolerance. We discuss several new targets in the study of insect cold tolerance (e.g. dopamine signaling and Na(+)-driven transport), but many previously identified candidate genes and pathways (e.g. heat shock proteins, Ca(2+) signaling, and ROS detoxification) were also identified in the present study, and our results are thus consistent with and extend the current understanding of the mechanisms of insect chilling tolerance.",2016,"Heath A MacMillan, Jose M Knee, Alice B Dennis, Hiroko Udaka, Katie E Marshall, Thomas J S Merritt, Brent J Sinclair, Heath A MacMillan, Jose M Knee, Alice B Dennis, Hiroko Udaka, Katie E Marshall, Thomas J S Merritt, Brent J Sinclair"
Intergenomic interactions between mitochondrial and Y-linked genes shape male mating patterns and fertility in Drosophila melanogaster,26419212,10.1111/evo.12788,"Under maternal inheritance, mitochondrial genomes are prone to accumulate mutations that exhibit male-biased effects. Such mutations should, however, place selection on the nuclear genome for modifier adaptations that mitigate mitochondrial-incurred male harm. One gene region that might harbor such modifiers is the Y-chromosome, given the abundance of Y-linked variation for male fertility, and because Y-linked modifiers would not exert antagonistic effects in females because they would be found only in males. Recent studies in Drosophila revealed a set of nuclear genes whose expression is sensitive to allelic variation among mtDNA- and Y-haplotypes, suggesting these genes might be entwined in evolutionary conflict between mtDNA and Y. Here, we test whether genetic variation across mtDNA and Y haplotypes, sourced from three disjunct populations, interacts to affect male mating patterns and fertility across 10 days of early life in D. melanogaster. We also investigate whether coevolved mito-Y combinations outperform their evolutionarily novel counterparts, as predicted if the interacting Y-linked variance is comprised of modifier adaptations. Although we found no evidence that coevolved mito-Y combinations outperformed their novel counterparts, interactions between mtDNA and Y-chromosomes affected male mating patterns. These interactions were dependent on male age; thus male reproductive success was shaped by G × G × E interactions.",2015,"Winston K W Yee, Björn Rogell, Bernardo Lemos, Damian K Dowling, Winston K W Yee, Björn Rogell, Bernardo Lemos, Damian K Dowling"
hobo-brothers elements and their time and place for horizontal transfer,24158527,10.1007/s10709-013-9746-1,"Transposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous components of nearly all genomes studied. These elements are highly variable in copy number, molecular structure and transposition strategies. They can move within and between genomes, thus increasing their copy numbers and avoiding being eliminated by stochastic and deterministic processes. hobo is a class II element isolated from Drosophila melanogaster. Previous phylogenetic analyses have shown that the canonical hobo element from D. melanogaster has a sister group formed by sequences found in D. willistoni (called howilli2) and D. mojavensis (called homo1). In the present study, we investigated 36 Drosophilidae species for sequences similar to howilli2 and homo1 using degenerate primers. Additionally, in silico searches were performed in 21 available Drosophila genomes. The obtained sequences formed a monophyletic sister group with the canonical hobo element; we termed these sequences 'hobo-brothers' elements. These elements showed a patch distribution and incongruities with the TE and host species phylogenies, suggesting possible cases of horizontal transfer (HT). Species that possess hobo-brothers sequences are from the New World, mainly Neotropical areas. In addition, the estimated divergence of the sequences found showed that these elements are or were recently active; the large number of HT events observed suggests that these elements could be experiencing an expansion process in Neotropical genomes.

Effect of magnetically simulated zero-gravity and enhanced gravity on the walk of the common fruitfly,22219396,10.1098/rsif.2011.0715,"Understanding the effects of gravity on biological organisms is vital to the success of future space missions. Previous studies in Earth orbit have shown that the common fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster) walks more quickly and more frequently in microgravity, compared with its motion on Earth. However, flight preparation procedures and forces endured on launch made it difficult to implement on the Earth's surface a control that exposed flies to the same sequence of major physical and environmental changes. To address the uncertainties concerning these behavioural anomalies, we have studied the walking paths of D. melanogaster in a pseudo-weightless environment (0g*) in our Earth-based laboratory. We used a strong magnetic field, produced by a superconducting solenoid, to induce a diamagnetic force on the flies that balanced the force of gravity. Simultaneously, two other groups of flies were exposed to a pseudo-hypergravity environment (2g*) and a normal gravity environment (1g*) within the spatially varying field. The flies had a larger mean speed in 0g* than in 1g*, and smaller in 2g*. The mean square distance travelled by the flies grew more rapidly with time in 0g* than in 1g*, and slower in 2g*. We observed no other clear effects of the magnetic field, up to 16.5 T, on the walks of the flies. We compare the effect of diamagnetically simulated weightlessness with that of weightlessness in an orbiting spacecraft, and identify the cause of the anomalous behaviour as the altered effective gravity.",2012,"Richard J A Hill, Oliver J Larkin, Camelia E Dijkstra, Ana I Manzano, Emilio de Juan, Michael R Davey, Paul Anthony, Laurence Eaves, F Javier Medina, Roberto Marco, Raul Herranz, Richard J A Hill, Oliver J Larkin, Camelia E Dijkstra, Ana I Manzano, Emilio de Juan, Michael R Davey, Paul Anthony, Laurence Eaves, F Javier Medina, Roberto Marco, Raul Herranz"
RNAi experiments in D. melanogaster: solutions to the overlooked problem of off-targets shared by independent dsRNAs,20957038,10.1371/journal.pone.0013119,"Background:
      
    

    
      RNAi technology is widely used to downregulate specific gene products. Investigating the phenotype induced by downregulation of gene products provides essential information about the function of the specific gene of interest. When RNAi is applied in Drosophila melanogaster or Caenorhabditis elegans, often large dsRNAs are used. One of the drawbacks of RNAi technology is that unwanted gene products with sequence similarity to the gene of interest can be down regulated too. To verify the outcome of an RNAi experiment and to avoid these unwanted off-target effects, an additional non-overlapping dsRNA can be used to down-regulate the same gene. However it has never been tested whether this approach is sufficient to reduce the risk of off-targets.
    

    
  


        Methodology:
      
    

    
      We created a novel tool to analyse the occurrence of off-target effects in Drosophila and we analyzed 99 randomly chosen genes.
    

    
  


        Principal findings:

"A caspase-like decoy molecule enhances the activity of a paralogous caspase in the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti",20417712,10.1016/j.ibmb.2010.04.011,"Caspases are cysteine proteases that play critical roles in apoptosis and other key cellular processes. A mechanism of caspase regulation that has been described in mammals and nematodes involves caspase-like decoy molecules, enzymatically inactive caspase homologs that have arisen by gene duplication and acquired the ability to regulate other caspases. Caspase-like decoy molecules are not found in Drosophila melanogaster, raising the question of whether this type of caspase regulation exists in insects. Phylogenomic analysis of caspase genes from twelve Drosophila and three mosquito species revealed several examples of duplicated caspase homologs lacking critical catalytic residues, making them candidate caspase-like decoy molecules. One of these, CASPS18 from the mosquito Aedes aegypti, is a homolog of the D. melanogaster caspase Decay and contains substitutions in two critical amino acid positions, including the catalytic cysteine residue. As expected, CASPS18 lacked caspase activity, but co-expression of CASPS18 with a paralogous caspase, CASPS19, in mosquito cells or co-incubation of CASPS18 and CASPS19 recombinant proteins resulted in greatly enhanced CASPS19 activity.

Population dynamics of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and their targets in Drosophila,19948818,10.1101/gr.095406.109,"Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA sequences that make up a large fraction of eukaryotic genomes. Recently it was discovered that PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a class of small RNA molecules that are mainly generated from transposable elements, are crucial repressors of active TEs in the germline of fruit flies. By quantifying expression levels of 32 TE families in piRNA pathway mutants relative to wild-type fruit flies, we provide evidence that piRNAs can severely silence the activities of retrotransposons. We incorporate piRNAs into a population genetic framework for retrotransposons and perform forward simulations to model the population dynamics of piRNA loci and their targets. Using parameters optimized for Drosophila melanogaster, our simulation results indicate that (1) piRNAs can significantly reduce the fitness cost of retrotransposons; (2) retrotransposons that generate piRNAs (piRTs) are selectively more advantageous, and such retrotransposon insertions more easily attain high frequency or fixation; (3) retrotransposons that are repressed by piRNAs (targetRTs), however, also have an elevated probability of reaching high frequency or fixation in the population because their deleterious effects are attenuated. By surveying the polymorphisms of piRT and targetRT insertions across nine strains of D. melanogaster, we verified these theoretical predictions with population genomic data. Our theoretical and empirical analysis suggests that piRNAs can significantly increase the fitness of individuals that bear them; however, piRNAs may provide a shelter or Trojan horse for retrotransposons, allowing them to increase in frequency in a population by shielding the host from the deleterious consequences of retrotransposition.",2010,"Jian Lu, Andrew G Clark, Jian Lu, Andrew G Clark"
Measuring mRNA stability during early Drosophila embryogenesis,19111183,10.1016/S0076-6879(08)02616-5,"Maternal mRNAs play a major role in directing early Drosophila melanogaster development, and thus, precise posttranscriptional regulation of these messages is imperative for normal embryogenesis. Although initially abundant on egg deposition, a subset of these maternal mRNAs is targeted for destruction during the first 2 to 3 h of embryogenesis. In this chapter, we describe molecular methods to determine the kinetics and mechanisms of maternal mRNA decay in the early D. melanogaster embryo. We show how both unfertilized eggs and fertilized embryos can be used to identify maternal mRNAs destined for degradation, to explain changes in decay kinetics over time, and to uncover the molecular mechanisms of targeted maternal mRNA turnover. In the first section, we explore the methods and outcomes of measuring decay on a ""gene-by-gene"" basis, which involves examination of a small number of transcripts by Northern blotting, RNA dot blotting, and real-time RT-PCR. In the second section, we provide a comprehensive examination of the applications of microarray technology to study global changes in maternal mRNA decay during early development.

With a total of 21 olfactory and 80 gustatory neurons, the sensory level is numerically much simpler than that of the adult. Moreover, its design is different than in the adult, showing an association between smell and taste sensilla. In contrast, the first-order relay of the olfactory afferents, the larval antennal lobe (LAL), exhibits adult-like features both in terms of structure and cell number. It shows a division into approximately 30 subunits, reminiscent of glomeruli in the adult antennal lobe. Taken together, the design of the larval chemosensory system is a ""hybrid,"" with larval-specific features in the periphery and central characteristics in common with the adult. The largely reduced numbers of afferents and the similar architecture of the LAL and the adult antennal lobe, render the larval chemosensory system of Drosophila a valuable model system, both for studying smell and taste and for examining the development of its adult organization.",2002,"François Python, Reinhard F Stocker, François Python, Reinhard F Stocker"
Does recombination improve selection on codon usage? Lessons from nematode and fly complete genomes,11320215,10.1073/pnas.091427698,"Understanding the factors responsible for variations in mutation patterns and selection efficacy along chromosomes is a prerequisite for deciphering genome sequences. Population genetics models predict a positive correlation between the efficacy of selection at a given locus and the local rate of recombination because of Hill-Robertson effects. Codon usage is considered one of the most striking examples that support this prediction at the molecular level. In a wide range of species including Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, codon usage is essentially shaped by selection acting for translational efficiency. Codon usage bias correlates positively with recombination rate in Drosophila, apparently supporting the hypothesis that selection on codon usage is improved by recombination. Here we present an exhaustive analysis of codon usage in C. elegans and D. melanogaster complete genomes. We show that in both genomes there is a positive correlation between recombination rate and the frequency of optimal codons. However, we demonstrate that in both species, this effect is due to a mutational bias toward G and C bases in regions of high recombination rate, possibly as a direct consequence of the recombination process. The correlation between codon usage bias and recombination rate in these species appears to be essentially determined by recombination-dependent mutational patterns, rather than selective effects. This result highlights that it is necessary to take into account the mutagenic effect of recombination to understand the evolutionary role and impact of recombination.",2001,"G Marais, D Mouchiroud, L Duret, G Marais, D Mouchiroud, L Duret"
"The CO2 sensitivity induced by two rhabdoviruses, Piry and Chandipura, in Drosophila melanogaster",813550,,"Piry and Chandipura viruses induce CO2 sensitivity after multiplication in D. melanogaster. Flies infected with Piry virus react to CO2 like flies infected with sigma virus: after a post-infection delay the flies become sensitive; sister batches exposed later on remain persistently CO2 sensitive. Flies infected with Chandipura virus react to CO2 like flies infected with VSV: flies become sensitive, but sister batches exposed later on recover and fail to show any CO2 sensitivity, although they remain infected with virus. These are consistent with the hypothesis that at the CO2 site (nervious system) a definite rhythm of production of budding sites, which transform the plasma membrane, is necessary for the CO2 sensitivity. Meanwhile, flies inoculated with Chandipura virus present a distinctive feature: below a definite temperature the flies do not become CO2 sensitive although it is still possible to observe a slight multiplication. The results from shift-up and shift-down experiments suggest that there is a cyrosensitive event in the viral multiplication. The experiments on the survival of infectious centers show that this event is implicated in the maturation step. With a study of the influence of previous CO2 exposure on CO2 sensitivity, when the expression of the viral functions are restricted by temperature, CO2 is whown to have a protective action probably produced by a cellular repair mechanism of non lethal lesions. When compared with VSV strains Brazil and New-Jersey, Piry and Chandipura viruses are moderately adapted to Drosophila. Like VSV, SVC virus and PFR, the Piry and Chandipura viruses have not been found in the progeny of infected flies, while with sigma virus ""l'héritier has shown that CO2 sensitivity is hereditary.",1975,"F Busscereau, F Busscereau"

Analysis of temporal transcription expression profiles reveal links between protein function and developmental stages of Drosophila melanogaster,29045400,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005791,"Accurate gene or protein function prediction is a key challenge in the post-genome era. Most current methods perform well on molecular function prediction, but struggle to provide useful annotations relating to biological process functions due to the limited power of sequence-based features in that functional domain. In this work, we systematically evaluate the predictive power of temporal transcription expression profiles for protein function prediction in Drosophila melanogaster. Our results show significantly better performance on predicting protein function when transcription expression profile-based features are integrated with sequence-derived features, compared with the sequence-derived features alone. We also observe that the combination of expression-based and sequence-based features leads to further improvement of accuracy on predicting all three domains of gene function. Based on the optimal feature combinations, we then propose a novel multi-classifier-based function prediction method for Drosophila melanogaster proteins, FFPred-fly+.

Possible contributors to this increased heat tolerance in winter could be their sub-zero adaptations (high polyol concentrations, antifreeze proteins, antifreeze glycolipids, etc.). To investigate if a sub-zero adaptation can increase organismal high temperature survivorship, we tested transgenic fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, with antifreeze proteins from the fire-colored beetle, Dendroides canadensis (DAFPs). Transgenic Drosophila melanogaster with individual DAFPs-1 and -4 had increased survivorship compared to control flies after 24 h when placed at 35-36.5 °C.

Healthy individuals however have continued to use it as a memory enhancer. This study was aimed at evaluating the combined therapy of donepezil and propolis on cognition in Drosophila melanogaster. Method. Drosophila melanogaster flies were divided into five groups and fed with the different treatment doses of ethanolic extract of propolis and donepezil as follows: normal food, propolis 250 mg/mL, propolis 50 mg/mL, donepezil 0.001M, and donepezil 0.001M/propolis 50 mg/mL added to their food.

Aging and CaMKII alter intracellular Ca2+ transients and heart rhythm in Drosophila melanogaster,25003749,10.1371/journal.pone.0101871,"Aging is associated to disrupted contractility and rhythmicity, among other cardiovascular alterations. Drosophila melanogaster shows a pattern of aging similar to human beings and recapitulates the arrhythmogenic conditions found in the human heart. Moreover, the kinase CaMKII has been characterized as an important regulator of heart function and an arrhythmogenic molecule that participate in Ca2+ handling. Using a genetically engineered expressed Ca2+ indicator, we report changes in cardiac Ca2+ handling at two different ages. Aging prolonged relaxation, reduced spontaneous heart rate (HR) and increased the occurrence of arrhythmias, ectopic beats and asystoles. Alignment between Drosophila melanogaster and human CaMKII showed a high degree of conservation and indicates that relevant phosphorylation sites in humans are also present in the fruit fly. Inhibition of CaMKII by KN-93 (CaMKII-specific inhibitor), reduced HR without significant changes in other parameters. By contrast, overexpression of CaMKII increased HR and reduced arrhythmias. Moreover, it increased fluorescence amplitude, maximal rate of rise of fluorescence and reduced time to peak fluorescence. These results suggest that CaMKII in Drosophila melanogaster acts directly on heart function and that increasing CaMKII expression levels could be beneficial to improve contractility.",2014,"Manuela Santalla, Carlos A Valverde, Ezequiel Harnichar, Ezequiel Lacunza, Javier Aguilar-Fuentes, Alicia Mattiazzi, Paola Ferrero, Manuela Santalla, Carlos A Valverde, Ezequiel Harnichar, Ezequiel Lacunza, Javier Aguilar-Fuentes, Alicia Mattiazzi, Paola Ferrero"
A Drosophila melanogaster strain from sub-equatorial Africa has exceptional thermotolerance but decreased Hsp70 expression,11441029,,"Drosophila melanogaster collected in sub-equatorial Africa in the 1970s are remarkably tolerant of sustained laboratory culture above 30 degrees C and of acute exposure to much warmer temperatures. Inducible thermotolerance of high temperatures, which in Drosophila melanogaster is due in part to the inducible molecular chaperone Hsp70, is only modest in this strain. Expression of Hsp70 protein and hsp70 mRNA is likewise reduced and has slower kinetics in this strain (T) than in a standard wild-type strain (Oregon R). These strains also differed in constitutive and heat-inducible levels of other molecular chaperones. The lower Hsp70 expression in the T strain apparently has no basis in the activation of the heat-shock transcription factor HSF, which is similar in T and Oregon R flies. Rather, the reduced expression may stem from insertion of two transposable elements, H.M.S. Beagle in the intergenic region of the 87A7 hsp70 gene cluster and Jockey in the hsp70Ba gene promoter. We hypothesize that the reduced Hsp70 expression in a Drosophila melanogaster strain living chronically at intermediate temperatures may represent an evolved suppression of the deleterious phenotypes of Hsp70.",2001,"O G Zatsepina, V V Velikodvorskaia, V B Molodtsov, D Garbuz, D N Lerman, B R Bettencourt, M E Feder, M B Evgenev, O G Zatsepina, V V Velikodvorskaia, V B Molodtsov, D Garbuz, D N Lerman, B R Bettencourt, M E Feder, M B Evgenev"
Microgravity effects on Drosophila melanogaster development and aging: comparative analysis of the results of the Fly experiment in the Biokosmos 9 biosatellite flight,11536953,10.1016/0273-1177(92)90279-7,"The results are presented of the exposure of Drosophila melanogaster to microgravity conditions during a 15-day biosatellite flight, Biokosmos 9, in a joint ESA-URSS project. The experimental containers were loaded before launch with a set of Drosophila melanogaster Oregon R larvae so that imagoes were due to emerge half-way through the flight. A large number of normally developed larvae were recovered from the space-flown containers. These larvae were able to develop into normal adults confirming earlier results that Drosophila melanogaster of a wild-type constitution can develop normally in the absence of gravity. However, microgravity exposure clearly enhances the number of growing embryos laid by the flies and possibly slows down the developmental pace of the microgravity-exposed animals. Due to some problems in the experimental set-up, this slowing down needs to be verified in future experiments. No live adult that had been exposed to microgravity was recovered from the experiment, so that no life span studies could be carried out, but adult males emerged from the recovered embyros showed a slight shortening in life span and a lower performance in other experimental tests of aging.

Patterns of natural selection at the Alcohol dehydrogenase gene of Drosophila americana,18806473,10.4161/fly.6875,"Similar outcomes are often observed in species exposed to similar selective regimes, but it is unclear how often the same mechanism of adaptive evolution is followed. Here we present an analysis of selection affecting sequence variation in the Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene of Drosophila americana, a species endemic to a large climate range that has been colonized by D. melanogaster. Unlike D. melanogaster, there is no evidence of selection on allozymes of ADH across the sampled range. This indicates that if there has been a similar adaptive response to climate in D. americana, it is not within the coding region of Adh. Instead, analyses of a combined dataset containing 86 alleles of Adh reveal purifying selection on the Adh gene, especially within its intron sequences. Frequency spectra of derived unpreferred variants at synonymous sites indicate that these sites are affected by weak purifying selection, but the deviation from neutrality is less drastic than observed for derived variants in noncoding introns. This contrast further supports the notion that noncoding sites in Drosophila are often subject to stronger selection pressures than synonymous sites.",2008,"Sara L Sheeley, Bryant F McAllister, Sara L Sheeley, Bryant F McAllister"

      The polytene nuclei of the dipteran Chironomus tentans (Ch. tentans) with their Balbiani ring (BR) genes constitute an exceptional model system for studies of the expression of endogenous eukaryotic genes.

        Results:
      
    

    
      The genome of Ch. tentans is approximately 200 Mb in size, and has a low GC content (31%) and a low repeat fraction (15%) compared to other Dipteran species. Phylogenetic inference revealed that Ch. tentans is a sister clade to mosquitoes, with a split 150-250 million years ago. To characterize the Ch. tentans gene expression machineries, we identified potential orthologus sequences to more than 600 Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster) proteins involved in the expression of protein-coding genes.

Neural pathways for the detection and discrimination of conspecific song in D. melanogaster,24794294,10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.048,"Background:
      
    

    
      During courtship, male Drosophila melanogaster sing a multipart courtship song to female flies. This song is of particular interest because (1) it is species specific and varies widely within the genus, (2) it is a gating stimulus for females, who are sensitive detectors of conspecific song, and (3) it is the only sexual signal that is under both neural and genetic control. This song is perceived via mechanosensory neurons in the antennal Johnston's organ, which innervate the antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC) of the brain. However, AMMC outputs that are responsible for detection and discrimination of conspecific courtship song remain unknown.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Using a large-scale anatomical screen of AMMC interneurons, we identify seven projection neurons (aPNs) and five local interneurons (aLNs) that outline a complex architecture for the ascending mechanosensory pathway. Neuronal inactivation and hyperactivation during behavior reveal that only two classes of interneurons are necessary for song responses--the projection neuron aPN1 and GABAergic interneuron aLN(al). These neurons are necessary in both male and female flies. Physiological recordings in aPN1 reveal the integration of courtship song as a function of pulse rate and outline an intracellular transfer function that likely facilitates the response to conspecific song.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      These results reveal a critical pathway for courtship hearing in male and female flies, in which both aLN(al) and aPN1 mediate the detection of conspecific song.

Evolutionary genomics of Glossina morsitans immune-related CLIP domain serine proteases and serine protease inhibitors,21055483,10.1016/j.meegid.2010.10.006,"Several species of haematophagous tsetse flies (genus Glossina) are vectors for trypanosomes, the parasitic protozoans that cause Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT). Although there was a reduced incidence of HAT in the mid 1960s, decreased disease surveillance has led to a resurgence of HAT in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite being efficient vectors for HAT transmission, the prevalence of G. morsitans infection by trypanosomes in the wild is surprisingly minimal. The precise mechanisms by which G. morsitans remain refractory to trypanosome infection are largely unknown although it has been demonstrated that G. morsitans mounts a strong immune response to invading pathogens. This study identifies G. morsitans immune-related CLIP domain serine proteases and their inhibitors, serine protease inhibitors (serpin) genes. It further establishes their evolutionary relationships with counterparts in Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Bombyx mori, Manduca sexta and Culex quinquefasciatus. Multiple sequence alignments show conservation of most secondary structure elements for both CLIPs and serpins. Amino acid composition of the serpin reactive site loop (RSL) indicates that the G. morsitans serpins act through an inhibitory mechanism to the target serine protease. Similar to D. melanogaster and unlike A. gambiae, the transcriptome data suggest that G. morsitans does not contain gene expansions in their CLIP-domain serine protease and serpin families.

The regulatory content of intergenic DNA shapes genome architecture,15059258,10.1186/gb-2004-5-4-r25,"Background:
      
    

    
      Factors affecting the organization and spacing of functionally unrelated genes in metazoan genomes are not well understood. Because of the vast size of a typical metazoan genome compared to known regulatory and protein-coding regions, functional DNA is generally considered to have a negligible impact on gene spacing and genome organization. In particular, it has been impossible to estimate the global impact, if any, of regulatory elements on genome architecture.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      To investigate this, we examined the relationship between regulatory complexity and gene spacing in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. We found that gene density directly reflects local regulatory complexity, such that the amount of noncoding DNA between a gene and its nearest neighbors correlates positively with that gene's regulatory complexity. Genes with complex functions are flanked by significantly more noncoding DNA than genes with simple or housekeeping functions. Genes of low regulatory complexity are associated with approximately the same amount of noncoding DNA in D. melanogaster and C. elegans, while loci of high regulatory complexity are significantly larger in the more complex animal. Complex genes in C. elegans have larger 5' than 3' noncoding intervals, whereas those in D. melanogaster have roughly equivalent 5' and 3' noncoding intervals.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Intergenic distance, and hence genome architecture, is highly nonrandom. Rather, it is shaped by regulatory information contained in noncoding DNA. Our findings suggest that in compact genomes, the species-specific loss of nonfunctional DNA reveals a landscape of regulatory information by leaving a profile of functional DNA in its wake.",2004,"Craig E Nelson, Bradley M Hersh, Sean B Carroll, Craig E Nelson, Bradley M Hersh, Sean B Carroll"

To explore the molecular basis of these different physiological functions, the functionality of human, Drosophila melanogaster and Artemia franciscana SRFs in mammalian cells has been compared in this article. D. melanogaster and, to a lesser extend, A. franciscana SRF co-expression represses the activity of strong SRF-dependent promoters, such as those of the mouse c-fos and A. franciscana actin 403 genes. Domain-exchange experiments showed that these results can be explained by the absence of a transactivation domain, functional in mammalian cells, in D. melanogaster and A. franciscana SRFs. Both invertebrate SRFs can dimerize with endogenous mouse SRF through the conserved DNA-binding and dimerization domain. Co-expression of human and A. franciscana SRFs activate expression of weaker SRF-dependent promoters, such as those of the human cardiac alpha-actin gene or an A. franciscana actin 403 promoter where the SRF-binding site has been mutated.

In order to determine sensitivity of different germ cell stages to the induction and modification of male recombination frequency, five 3-day broods were taken from every F1 male. DES showed toxic effect on egg-to-adult development. DES was found to be a potent recombinogen. Several cases of non-reciprocal male recombination were recorded. The most frequent recombinant phenotype observed was b cn followed by cn and al. Majority of the recombinants appeared in clusters suggesting their pre-meiotic origin. DES produced male recombination at a stage where only primary spermatocytes were present in the larval testes. CPL when given as a pre- or post-treatment with DES revealed highest frequency of male recombination in broods that represented effect of treatment on spermatogonia predominantly. CPL enhanced the overall level of male recombination produced by DES in both pre- and post-treatments.

Similar, if not identical states can be generated in vitro from purified E. coli UBX protein by a kinase activity in nuclear extracts from D. melanogaster cells. Temporal developmental profiles of UBX isoforms parallel those for the respective mRNAs, and all isoforms are similarly phosphorylated throughout embryogenesis. Analysis by cotransfection assays of the promoter activation and repression functions of mutant UBX proteins with various deletions in the N-constant region shows that repression is generally insensitive to deletion and, hence, presumably to phosphorylation. By contrast, the activation function is differentially sensitive to the different deletions in a manner indicating the absence of a discrete activating domain and instead, the presence of multiple activating sequences spread throughout the region.",1991,"E R Gavis, D S Hogness, E R Gavis, D S Hogness"
Ethanol tolerances of Drosophila melanogaster populations selected on different concentrations of ethanol supplemented media,24254020,10.1007/BF00251111,"Eight recently collected Australasian populations of D. melanogaster were each divided into eight selection lines. Two of these lines from each population were maintained on one of four types of selection media: standard food supplemented with 0%, 3%, 6% and 9% ethanol. After 30 generations the selection lines were tested for tolerance to 9% ethanol medium and after another 20 generations adults were tested for tolerance to concentrated ethanol fumes. Significant differences in tolerance were found among lines selected on different media which were consistent across the eight populations. On the 9% test media, the 6% and 9% selection lines, as compared with the control lines selected on 0% ethanol, were more likely to survive as pre-adults or adults, faster to develop as preadults, and heavier and more productive as adults. However, the tolerance of the 3% lines to the 9% test media was less than that of the 0% control lines in preadult and adult survival, intermediate between that of the 0% and the 6% and 9% lines in productivities, and apparently superior to the 6% and 9% lines in development times and adult weights. The 3%, 6% and 9% lines showed similar tolerances to the ethanol vapour. Previous work showed that 3% ethanol can be a metabolic benefit to D. melanogaster but 6% and 9% are metabolic costs. The present results suggest that the phenotype selected on 3% to obtain a metabolic benefit differs in many respects from that selected on 6% and 9% to minimise their detrimental effects.",1985,"J G Oakeshott, F M Cohan, J B Gibson, J G Oakeshott, F M Cohan, J B Gibson"

MicroRNA regulation of CTP synthase and cytoophidium in Drosophila melanogaster,31678212,10.1016/j.yexcr.2019.111688,"CTPsyn is a crucial metabolic enzyme which synthesizes CTP nucleotides. It has the extraordinary ability to compartmentalize into filaments termed cytoophidia. Though the structure is evolutionarily conserved across kingdoms, the mechanisms behind their formation remain unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short single-stranded RNA capable of directing mRNA silencing and degradation. D. melanogaster has a high total gene count to miRNA gene number ratio, alluding to the possibility that CTPsyn too may come under their regulation. A thorough miRNA overexpression involving 123 miRNAs was conducted, followed by CTPsyn-specific staining upon cytoophidia-rich egg chambers. This revealed a small group of candidates which confer either a lengthening or truncating effect on cytoophidia, suggesting they may play a role in regulating CTPsyn. MiR-975 and miR-1014 are both cytoophidia-elongating, whereas miR-190 and miR-932 are cytoophidia-shortening. Though target prediction shows that miR-975 and miR-932 do indeed have binding sites on CTPsyn mRNA, in vitro assays instead revealed a low probability of this being true, instead indicating that the effects asserted by overexpressed miRNAs indirectly reach CTPsyn and its cytoophidia through the actions of middling elements. In silico target prediction and qPCR quantification indicated that, at least for miR-932 and miR-1014, these undetermined elements may be players in fat metabolism. This is the first study to thoroughly investigate miRNAs in connection to CTPsyn expression and activity in any species. The findings presented could serve as a basis for further queries into not only the fundamental aspects of the enzyme's regulation, but may uncover new facets of closely related pathways as well.",2019,"Najat Dzaki, Wai Kan Woo, Shallinie Thangadurai, Ghows Azzam, Najat Dzaki, Wai Kan Woo, Shallinie Thangadurai, Ghows Azzam"
Transcription start site profiling uncovers divergent transcription and enhancer-associated RNAs in Drosophila melanogaster,29466941,10.1186/s12864-018-4510-7,"Background:
      
    

    
      High-resolution transcription start site (TSS) mapping in D. melanogaster embryos and cell lines has revealed a rich and detailed landscape of both cis- and trans-regulatory elements and factors. However, TSS profiling has not been investigated in an orthogonal in vivo setting. Here, we present a comprehensive dataset that links TSS dynamics with nucleosome occupancy and gene expression in the wandering third instar larva, a developmental stage characterized by large-scale shifts in transcriptional programs in preparation for metamorphosis.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The data recapitulate major regulatory classes of TSSs, based on peak width, promoter-proximal polymerase pausing, and cis-regulatory element density. We confirm the paucity of divergent transcription units in D. melanogaster, but also identify notable exceptions. Furthermore, we identify thousands of novel initiation events occurring at unannotated TSSs that can be classified into functional categories by their local density of histone modifications. Interestingly, a sub-class of these unannotated TSSs overlaps with functionally validated enhancer elements, consistent with a regulatory role for ""enhancer RNAs"" (eRNAs) in defining developmental transcription programs.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      High-depth TSS mapping is a powerful strategy for identifying and characterizing low-abundance and/or low-stability RNAs. Global analysis of transcription initiation patterns in a developing organism reveals a vast number of novel initiation events that identify potential eRNAs as well as other non-coding transcripts critical for animal development.",2018,"Michael P Meers, Karen Adelman, Robert J Duronio, Brian D Strahl, Daniel J McKay, A Gregory Matera, Michael P Meers, Karen Adelman, Robert J Duronio, Brian D Strahl, Daniel J McKay, A Gregory Matera"
[Comparative analysis of heat shock promoters efficiency in two diptera species],25831893,,"Heat shock proteins (Hsp) provide cellular and whole body adaptation of animals to various adverse environmental conditions. Hsp70 is apparently the major player underlying biological adaptation in all organisms studied so far. In all animals the regulatory regions of studied heat shock genes include several conservative promoter elements HSEs (heat shock elements) that are necessary for binding of heat shock transcription factor (HSF). The promoter regions of hsp70 genes are extremely conserved and, hence, it was generally accepted that they are universal and can operate in species belonging to different phyla. In the present work we performed the comparative analysis which revealed characteristic differences in the hsp 70 promoters of two Diptera species: Drosophila melanogaster and highly thermotolerance soldier fly Stratiomys singularior. We measured promoters activity in D. melanogaster cell culture exploring in vitro luciferase reporter assay. The analysis demonstrated significantly higher strength ofD. melanogaster promoters in spite of the fact that comparable numbers of HSEs are present in both species. These drastic differences in the promoter strength are probably due to absence of GAF-binding sites, which are necessary for efficient functioning of D. melanogaster hsp70 promoters. In contrast, comparison of hsp83 promoters isolated from these two species does not show significant differences. Our results demonstrate existence of different evolutionary trends in the regulation of the hsp70 expression even within the same order (Diptera).",2014,"L N Astakhova, O G Zatsepina, M B Evgen'ev, D G Garbuz, L N Astakhova, O G Zatsepina, M B Evgen'ev, D G Garbuz"
"Changes in cuticular lipids, water loss and desiccation resistance in a tropical drosophilid: analysis of variation between and within populations",18719406,10.4161/fly.6619,"We investigated within as well as between population variability in desiccation resistance, cuticular lipid mass per fly and cuticular water loss in nine geographical populations of a tropical drosophilid, Zaprionus indianus. Interestingly, the amount of cuticular lipids and desiccation resistance in this non-melanic species are significantly higher as compared with melanic Drosophila melanogaster. On the basis of isofemale line analysis, within population trait variability in cuticular lipid mass per fly is positively correlated with desiccation resistance and negatively correlated with cuticular water loss but show lack of correlation with body size. We observed geographical variation in the amount of cuticular lipid mass per fly in Zaprionus indianus but no such divergence was found in D.melanogaster. In both the species, geographical variations in desiccation resistance are negatively correlated with cuticular water loss but the underlying mechanisms for changes in cuticular permeability are quite different. Thus, we may suggest that body melanisation and cuticular lipids may represent alternative strategies for coping with dehydration stress in melanic versus non-melanic drosophilids. For both the species, desiccation resistance and cuticular water loss are correlated with regular increase in aridity in the northern subtropical localities as compared with southern peninsular humid tropical localities. The role of climatic selection is evident from multiple regression analysis with seasonal changes in temperature and humidity (Tcv and RHcv) of the sites of origin of populations of Zaprionus indianus along latitude.",2008,"Ravi Parkash, Bhawna Kalra, Vineeta Sharma, Ravi Parkash, Bhawna Kalra, Vineeta Sharma"
Changes in body melanisation and desiccation resistance in highland vs. lowland populations of D. melanogaster,18519137,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2008.04.008,"Wild caught samples of Drosophila melanogaster from five highland localities showed parallel changes in melanisation and desiccation resistance in darker versus lighter phenotypes, i.e. darker flies (>45% melanisation) showed significantly higher desiccation resistance than lighter flies (<30% melanisation). In order to find an association between body melanisation and desiccation resistance, highland and lowland populations from tropical and subtropical regions (11.15-31.06 degrees N) of the Indian subcontinent were raised and investigated at 21 degrees C for four physiological traits, i.e. per cent body melanisation, desiccation resistance, rate of water loss and rate of water absorption. On the basis of mother-offspring regression, body melanisation and desiccation resistance showed higher heritability (0.58-0.68) and thus these traits are suitable for laboratory analyses. Significantly higher melanisation as well as desiccation resistance were observed in highland populations as compared with lowland populations. The rates of water loss as well as absorption were negatively correlated with body melanisation, i.e. darker flies from highlands showed a reduced rate of water loss as well as a lower rate of water absorption while the reverse trend was observed in lighter flies from lowlands. On the basis of multiple regressions, significant effects due to combined altitude and latitude were observed for all the four physiological traits. Local climatic conditions (i.e. annual average temperature and relative humidity) helped in explaining parallel changes in body melanisation and desiccation resistance in D. melanogaster.",2008,"Ravi Parkash, Subhash Rajpurohit, Seema Ramniwas, Ravi Parkash, Subhash Rajpurohit, Seema Ramniwas"
Functional analyses of tiptop and antennapedia in the embryonic development of Oncopeltus fasciatus suggests an evolutionary pathway from ground state to insect legs,15563520,10.1242/dev.01561,"In insects, selector genes are thought to modify the development of a default, or 'ground state', appendage into a tagma-specific appendage such as a mouthpart, antenna or leg. In the best described example, Drosophila melanogaster, the primary determination of leg identity is thought to result from regulatory interactions between the Hox genes and the antennal-specifying gene homothorax. Based on RNA-interference, a functional analysis of the selector gene tiptop and the Hox gene Antennapedia in Oncopeltus fasciatus embryogenesis is presented. It is shown that, in O. fasciatus, tiptop is required for the segmentation of distal leg segments and is required to specify the identity of the leg. The distal portions of legs with reduced tiptop develop like antennae. Thus, tiptop can act as a regulatory switch that chooses between antennal and leg identity. By contrast, Antennapedia does not act as a switch between leg and antennal identity. This observation suggests a significant difference in the mechanism of leg specification between O. fasciatus and D. melanogaster. These observations also suggest a significant plasticity in the mechanism of leg specification during insect evolution that is greater than would have been expected based on strictly morphological or molecular comparisons. Finally, it is proposed that a tiptop-like activity is a likely component of an ancestral leg specification mechanism. Incorporating a tiptop-like activity into a model of the leg-specification mechanism explains several mutant phenotypes, previously described in D. melanogaster, and suggests a mechanism for the evolution of legs from a ground state.",2005,"Scott W Herke, Nahum V Serio, Bryan T Rogers, Scott W Herke, Nahum V Serio, Bryan T Rogers"
Codon usage by transposable elements and their host genes in five species,11965435,10.1007/s00239-001-0059-0,"We compared the codon usage of sequences of transposable elements (TEs) with that of host genes from the species Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Homo sapiens. Factorial correspondence analysis showed that, regardless of the base composition of the genome, the TEs differed from the genes of their host species by their AT-richness. In all species, the percentage of A + T on the third codon position of the TEs was higher than that on the first codon position and lower than that in the noncoding DNA of the genomes. This indicates that the codon choice is not simply the outcome of mutational bias but is also subject to selection constraints. A tendency toward higher A + T on the third position than on the first position was also found in the host genes of A. thaliana, C. elegans, and S. cerevisiae but not in those of D. melanogaster and H. sapiens. This strongly suggests that the AT choice is a host-independent characteristic common to all TEs. The codon usage of TEs generally appeared to be different from the mean of the host genes. In the AT-rich genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the codon usage bias of TEs was similar to that of weakly expressed genes. In the GC-rich genome of D. melanogaster, however, the bias in codon usage of the TEs clearly differed from that of weakly expressed genes. These findings suggest that selection acts on TEs and that TEs may display specific behavior within the host genomes.",2002,"Emmanuelle Lerat, Pierre Capy, Christian Biémont, Emmanuelle Lerat, Pierre Capy, Christian Biémont"
Amino acid and nucleotide recurrence in aligned sequences: synonymous substitution patterns in association with global and local base compositions,11000273,10.1093/nar/28.19.3801,"The tendency for repetitiveness of nucleotides in DNA sequences has been reported for a variety of organisms. We show that the tendency for repetitive use of amino acids is widespread and is observed even for segments conserved between human and Drosophila melanogaster at the level of >50% amino acid identity. This indicates that repetitiveness influences not only the weakly constrained segments but also those sequence segments conserved among phyla. Not only glutamine (Q) but also many of the 20 amino acids show a comparable level of repetitiveness. Repetitiveness in bases at codon position 3 is stronger for human than for D.melanogaster, whereas local repetitiveness in intron sequences is similar between the two organisms. While genes for immune system-specific proteins, but not ancient human genes (i.e. human homologs of Escherichia coli genes), have repetitiveness at codon bases 1 and 2, repetitiveness at codon base 3 for these groups is similar, suggesting that the human genome has at least two mechanisms generating local repetitiveness. Neither amino acid nor nucleotide repetitiveness is observed beyond the exon boundary, denying the possibility that such repetitiveness could mainly stem from natural selection on mRNA or protein sequences. Analyses of mammalian sequence alignments show that while the 'between gene' GC content heterogeneity, which is linked to 'isochores', is a principal factor associated with the bias in substitution patterns in human, 'within gene' heterogeneity in nucleotide composition is also associated with such bias on a more local scale. The relationship amongst the various types of repetitiveness is discussed.",2000,"M Nishizawa, K Nishizawa, M Nishizawa, K Nishizawa"
A proteomics approach to the identification of mammalian mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal proteins,10938081,10.1074/jbc.M003596200,"Mammalian mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal proteins were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins in six individual spots were subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion. Peptides were separated by capillary liquid chromatography, and the sequences of selected peptides were obtained by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The peptide sequences obtained were used to screen human expressed sequence tag data bases, and complete consensus cDNAs were assembled. Mammalian mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal proteins from six different classes of ribosomal proteins were identified. Only two of these proteins have significant sequence similarities to ribosomal proteins from prokaryotes. These proteins correspond to Escherichia coli S10 and S14. Homologs of two human mitochondrial proteins not found in prokaryotes were observed in the genomes of Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. A homolog of one of these proteins was observed in D. melanogaster but not in C. elegans, while a homolog of the other was present in C. elegans but not in D. melanogaster. A homolog of one of the ribosomal proteins not found in prokaryotes was tentatively identified in the yeast genome.

Host specificity of Asian parasitoids for potential classical biological control of Drosophila suzukii,30100830,10.1007/s10340-018-1003-z,"The Asian spotted wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii, has recently become a serious pest of soft fruits in Europe. Classical biological control through the introduction of larval parasitoids from its native range in Asia is presently being considered. However, host specificity of potential biological control agents has to be determined to avoid releasing species that may have unintended non-target impacts. Larvae of six different European non-target fly species and the target D. suzukii were exposed either on diet or blueberries to three Asian larval parasitoids, Asobara japonica, Leptopilina japonica, and Ganaspis cf. brasiliensis, and one European species, Leptopilina heterotoma. Asobara japonica showed the lowest specificity, attacking and developing in all Drosophilidae. Leptopilina japonica successfully parasitized two non-target Drosophilidae, D. melanogaster and D. subobscura, with one singly progeny emerging from D. immigrans. Ganaspis cf. brasiliensis had the highest level of specificity but variations occurred between two geographical populations tested. A Japanese population was strictly specific to D. suzukii, whereas another population from China parasitized D. suzukii, D. melanogaster and sporadically D. subobscura. The European L. heterotoma successfully developed in D. melanogaster, D. subobscura and occasionally in D. immigrans, but nearly all eggs and larvae in D. suzukii were encapsulated. These results show that Ganaspis cf. brasiliensis is the species with the highest potential for biological control, but more studies are needed on its taxonomic status and the existence of biotypes or cryptic species varying in their specificity before field releases can be conducted in Europe.",2018,"Pierre Girod, Océane Lierhmann, Teddy Urvois, Ted C J Turlings, Marc Kenis, Tim Haye, Pierre Girod, Océane Lierhmann, Teddy Urvois, Ted C J Turlings, Marc Kenis, Tim Haye"
Gene family evolution across 12 Drosophila genomes,17997610,10.1371/journal.pgen.0030197,"Comparison of whole genomes has revealed large and frequent changes in the size of gene families. These changes occur because of high rates of both gene gain (via duplication) and loss (via deletion or pseudogenization), as well as the evolution of entirely new genes. Here we use the genomes of 12 fully sequenced Drosophila species to study the gain and loss of genes at unprecedented resolution. We find large numbers of both gains and losses, with over 40% of all gene families differing in size among the Drosophila. Approximately 17 genes are estimated to be duplicated and fixed in a genome every million years, a rate on par with that previously found in both yeast and mammals. We find many instances of extreme expansions or contractions in the size of gene families, including the expansion of several sex- and spermatogenesis-related families in D. melanogaster that also evolve under positive selection at the nucleotide level. Newly evolved gene families in our dataset are associated with a class of testes-expressed genes known to have evolved de novo in a number of cases. Gene family comparisons also allow us to identify a number of annotated D. melanogaster genes that are unlikely to encode functional proteins, as well as to identify dozens of previously unannotated D. melanogaster genes with conserved homologs in the other Drosophila. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the apparent stasis in total gene number among species has masked rapid turnover in individual gene gain and loss. It is likely that this genomic revolving door has played a large role in shaping the morphological, physiological, and metabolic differences among species.",2007,"Matthew W Hahn, Mira V Han, Sang-Gook Han, Matthew W Hahn, Mira V Han, Sang-Gook Han"

Combined evidence annotation of transposable elements in genome sequences,16110336,10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010022,"Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile, repetitive sequences that make up significant fractions of metazoan genomes. Despite their near ubiquity and importance in genome and chromosome biology, most efforts to annotate TEs in genome sequences rely on the results of a single computational program, RepeatMasker. In contrast, recent advances in gene annotation indicate that high-quality gene models can be produced from combining multiple independent sources of computational evidence. To elevate the quality of TE annotations to a level comparable to that of gene models, we have developed a combined evidence-model TE annotation pipeline, analogous to systems used for gene annotation, by integrating results from multiple homology-based and de novo TE identification methods. As proof of principle, we have annotated ""TE models"" in Drosophila melanogaster Release 4 genomic sequences using the combined computational evidence derived from RepeatMasker, BLASTER, TBLASTX, all-by-all BLASTN, RECON, TE-HMM and the previous Release 3.1 annotation. Our system is designed for use with the Apollo genome annotation tool, allowing automatic results to be curated manually to produce reliable annotations. The euchromatic TE fraction of D. melanogaster is now estimated at 5.3% (cf. 3.86% in Release 3.1), and we found a substantially higher number of TEs (n = 6,013) than previously identified (n = 1,572). Most of the new TEs derive from small fragments of a few hundred nucleotides long and highly abundant families not previously annotated (e.g., INE-1). We also estimated that 518 TE copies (8.6%) are inserted into at least one other TE, forming a nest of elements. The pipeline allows rapid and thorough annotation of even the most complex TE models, including highly deleted and/or nested elements such as those often found in heterochromatic sequences. Our pipeline can be easily adapted to other genome sequences, such as those of the D. melanogaster heterochromatin or other species in the genus Drosophila.",2005,"Hadi Quesneville, Casey M Bergman, Olivier Andrieu, Delphine Autard, Danielle Nouaud, Michael Ashburner, Dominique Anxolabehere, Hadi Quesneville, Casey M Bergman, Olivier Andrieu, Delphine Autard, Danielle Nouaud, Michael Ashburner, Dominique Anxolabehere"

Quantitative real-time PCR with SYBR Green detection to assess gene duplication in insects: study of gene dosage in Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera) and in Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera),21443764,10.1186/1756-0500-4-84,"Background:
      
    

    
      The accurate determination of the number of copies of a gene in the genome (gene dosage) is essential for a number of genetic analyses. Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) with TaqMan detection has shown advantages over traditional Southern-blot and FISH techniques, however the high costs of the required labeled probes is an important limitation of this method. qPCR with SYBR Green I detection is a simple and inexpensive alternative, but it has never been applied to the determination of the copy number of low copy number genes in organisms with high allelic variability (as some insects), where a very small margin of error is essential.
    

    
  


        Findings:
      
    

    
      We have tested the suitability of the qPCR with SYBR Green I detection methodology for the detection of low copy number genes in two insects: the genetically well characterized Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera) and the poor genetically characterized Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera). The system was applied to determine the copy number of: (1) the O. nubilalis cadherin gene, involved in the mode of action of Bacillus thuringiensis toxins, which showed indirect evidence of duplication, and (2) the D. melanogaster BarH1 and BarH2 genes, located within the Bar region of the X chromosome, to clearly determine whether they both are covered by the tandem duplication in the classical Bar (B1) mutant. Our results showed that the O. nubilalis cadherin gene is an autosomal single copy gene and that BarH1, but not BarH2, is duplicated in the Drosophila B1 mutant.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This work shows that qPCR with SYBR Green I detection can be specific and accurate enough to distinguish between one and two gene copies per haploid genome of genes with high allelic variability. The technique is sensitive enough to give reliable results with a minimum amount of sample (DNA from individual thoraxes) and to detect gene duplications in tandem.",2011,"Yolanda Bel, Juan Ferré, Baltasar Escriche, Yolanda Bel, Juan Ferré, Baltasar Escriche"
Comparative toxic potential of market formulation of two organophosphate pesticides in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster (hsp70-lacZ),16328894,10.1007/s10565-005-0145-y,"This study investigated the working hypothesis that two widely used organophosphate pesticides; Nuvan and Dimecron, exert toxic effects in Drosophila. Transgenic D. melanogaster (hsp70-lacZ) was used as a model for assaying stress gene expression and AchE activity as an endpoint for toxicity and also to evaluate whether stress gene expression is sufficient to protect against toxic insult of the chemicals and to prevent tissue damage. The study was extended to investigate the effect of the pesticides on the life cycle and reproduction of the organism. The study showed that Nuvan affected emergence of the exposed flies more drastically than Dimecron and the effect was lethal at the highest tested concentration (0.075 ppm). While Nuvan at 0.0075 and 0.015 ppm concentrations affected reproduction of the flies significantly, the effect of Dimecron was significant only at 0.015 and 0.075 ppm. Nuvan-exposed third-instar larvae exhibited a 1.2-fold to 1.5-fold greater hsp70 expression compared to Dimecron at concentrations ranging from 0.0075 to 0.075 ppm following 12 and 18 h exposure. While maximum expression of hsp70 was observed in Nuvan-exposed third-instar larval tissues following 18 h exposure at 0.075 ppm, Dimecron at the same dietary concentration induced a maximum expression of hsp70 following 24 h exposure. Further, concomitant with a significant induction of hsp70, significant inhibition of AchE was observed following chemical exposure and temperature shock. Concurrent with a significant decline in hsp70 expression in Nuvan-exposed larvae after 48 h at 0.075 ppm, tissue damage was evident. Dimecron-exposed larvae exhibited a plateau in hsp70 induction even after 48 h exposure and moderate tissue damage was observed in these larvae. The present study suggests that Nuvan is more cytotoxic than Dimecron in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster.",2005,"S C Gupta, H R Siddique, D K Saxena, D Kar Chowdhuri, S C Gupta, H R Siddique, D K Saxena, D Kar Chowdhuri"

Drosophila S2R(+) cells, silenced for drim2 expression, contained markedly reduced pools of both purine and pyrimidine dNTPs in mitochondria, whereas cytosolic pools were unaffected. In vivo drim2 homozygous knock-out was lethal at the larval stage, preceded by the following: (i) impaired locomotor behavior; (ii) decreased rates of oxygen consumption, and (iii) depletion of mtDNA.

No accelerated rate of protein evolution in male-biased Drosophila pseudoobscura genes,16816428,10.1534/genetics.106.057414,"Sexually dimorphic traits are often subject to diversifying selection. Genes with a male-biased gene expression also are probably affected by sexual selection and have a high rate of protein evolution. We used SAGE to measure sex-biased gene expression in Drosophila pseudoobscura. Consistent with previous results from D. melanogaster, a larger number of genes were male biased (402 genes) than female biased (138 genes). About 34% of the genes changed the sex-related expression pattern between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. Combining gene expression with protein divergence between both species, we observed a striking difference in the rate of evolution for genes with a male-biased gene expression in one species only. Contrary to expectations, D. pseudoobscura genes in this category showed no accelerated rate of protein evolution, while D. melanogaster genes did. If sexual selection is driving molecular evolution of male-biased genes, our data imply a radically different selection regime in D. pseudoobscura.",2006,"Muralidhar Metta, Rambabu Gudavalli, Jean-Michel Gibert, Christian Schlötterer, Muralidhar Metta, Rambabu Gudavalli, Jean-Michel Gibert, Christian Schlötterer"
Effects of the nuclear genome on selective transmission of mitochondrial DNA in Drosophila,9339540,10.1266/ggs.72.119,"In mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy in Drosophila, we previously reported that mtDNA was selectively transmitted depending on temperature (Matsuura et al., 1991). To investigate the effects of nuclear genome on the temperature-dependent transmission, two sets of heteroplasmy were constructed by germ-plasm transplantation, and changes in the relative proportion of two types of mtDNA were examined at 19 degrees C and 25 degrees C. In heteroplasmy possessing D. melanogaster and D. mauritiana mtDNA, two different nuclear genomes of D. melanogaster were examined after reciprocally substituting the nuclear genomes. In heteroplasmy possessing D. simulans and D. mauritiana mtDNA, nuclear genomes of D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. mauritiana were used. For each set of mtDNA combination, the modes of temperature-dependent transmission of mtDNA differed according to the nuclear genome used. From these and our previous results (Matsuura et al., 1991; Tsujimoto et al., 1991), it is clear that the temperature-dependent transmission of mtDNA is affected by nuclear genome.

Functional expression of Δ12 fatty acid desaturase modulates thermoregulatory behaviour in Drosophila,32678126,10.1038/s41598-020-68601-2,"Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play crucial roles in adaptation to cold environments in a wide variety of animals and plants. However, the mechanisms by which PUFAs affect thermoregulatory behaviour remain elusive. Thus, we investigated the roles of PUFAs in thermoregulatory behaviour of Drosophila melanogaster. To this end, we generated transgenic flies expressing Caenorhabditis elegans Δ12 fatty acid desaturase (FAT-2), which converts mono-unsaturated fatty acids to PUFAs such as linoleic acid [C18:2 (n-6)] and linolenic acid [C18:3 (n-3)]. Neuron-specific expression of FAT-2 using the GAL4/UAS expression system led to increased contents of C18:2 (n-6)-containing phospholipids in central nerve system (CNS) and caused significant decreases in preferred temperature of third instar larvae. In genetic screening and calcium imaging analyses of thermoreceptor-expressing neurons, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of FAT-2 in TRPA1-expressing neurons led to decreases in preferred temperature by modulating neuronal activity.

A neuronal pathway that controls sperm ejection and storage in female Drosophila,25702579,10.1016/j.cub.2015.01.050,"In polyandrous females, sperm storage permits competition between sperm of different mates, and in some species females influence the relative fertilization success of competing sperm in favor of a preferred mate [1, 2]. In female Drosophila melanogaster, sperm competition is strongly influenced by the timing of sperm ejection from the uterus [3, 4]. Understanding how female behavior influences sperm competition requires knowledge of the neuronal mechanisms controlling sperm retention and storage, which is currently lacking. Here, we show that D. melanogaster females eject male ejaculates from the uterus 1-6 hr after mating with a stereotypic behavior regulated by a brain signaling pathway composed of diuretic hormone 44 (Dh44), a neuropeptide related to vertebrate corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), and its receptor, Dh44R1. Suppression of Dh44 signals in the brain expedites sperm ejection from the uterus, resulting in marked reduction of sperm in the storage organs and decreased fecundity, whereas enhancement of Dh44 signals delays sperm expulsion. The Dh44 function was mapped to six neurons located in the pars intercerebralis of the brain together with a small subset of Dh44R1 neurons that express the sex-specific transcription factor doublesex. This study identifies a neuronal pathway by which females can control sperm retention and storage and provides new insight into how the female might exercise post-copulatory sexual selection.",2015,"Kang-Min Lee, Ivana Daubnerová, R Elwyn Isaac, Chen Zhang, Sekyu Choi, Jongkyeong Chung, Young-Joon Kim, Kang-Min Lee, Ivana Daubnerová, R Elwyn Isaac, Chen Zhang, Sekyu Choi, Jongkyeong Chung, Young-Joon Kim"
Overexpression of glutathione transferase E7 in Drosophila differentially impacts toxicity of organic isothiocyanates in males and females,25329882,10.1371/journal.pone.0110103,"Organic isothiocyanates (ITCs) are allelochemicals produced by plants in order to combat insects and other herbivores. The compounds are toxic electrophiles that can be inactivated and conjugated with intracellular glutathione in reactions catalyzed by glutathione transferases (GSTs). The Drosophila melanogaster GSTE7 was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified for functional studies. The enzyme showed high catalytic activity with various isothiocyanates including phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) and allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), which in millimolar dietary concentrations conferred toxicity to adult D. melanogaster leading to death or a shortened life-span of the flies. In situ hybridization revealed a maternal contribution of GSTE7 transcripts to embryos, and strongest zygotic expression in the digestive tract. Transgenesis involving the GSTE7 gene controlled by an actin promoter produced viable flies expressing the GSTE7 transcript ubiquitously. Transgenic females show a significantly increased survival when subjected to the same PEITC treatment as the wild-type flies. By contrast, transgenic male flies show a significantly lower survival rate. Oviposition activity was enhanced in transgenic flies. The effect was significant in transgenic females reared in the absence of ITCs as well as in the presence of 0.15 mM PEITC or 1 mM AITC. Thus the GSTE7 transgene elicits responses to exposure to ITC allelochemicals which differentially affect life-span and fecundity of male and female flies.",2014,"Aslam M A Mazari, Olle Dahlberg, Bengt Mannervik, Mattias Mannervik, Aslam M A Mazari, Olle Dahlberg, Bengt Mannervik, Mattias Mannervik"
Hox-mediated regulation of doublesex sculpts sex-specific abdomen morphology in Drosophila,22488883,10.1002/dvdy.23791,"Background:
      
    

    
      Hox transcription factors are deeply conserved proteins that guide development through regulation of diverse target genes. Furthermore, alteration in Hox target cis-regulation has been proposed as a major mechanism of animal morphological evolution. Crucial to understanding how homeotic genes sculpt the developing body and contribute to the evolution of form is identification and characterization of regulatory targets. Because target specificity is achieved through physical or genetic interactions with cofactors or co-regulators, characterizing interactions between homeotic genes and regulatory partners is also critical. In Drosophila melanogaster, sexually dimorphic abdominal morphology results from sex-specific gene regulation mediated by the Hox protein Abdominal-B (Abd-B) and products of the sex-determination gene doublesex (dsx). Together these transcription factors regulate numerous sex-specific characters, including pigmentation, cuticle morphology, and abdominal segment number.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We show Dsx expression in the developing D. melanogaster pupal abdomen is spatiotemporally dynamic, correlating with segments that undergo sexually dimorphic morphogenesis. Furthermore, our genetic analyses show Dsx expression is Abd-B dependent.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Doublesex and Abd-B are not only requisite co-regulators of sexually dimorphic abdominal morphology. We propose that dsx is itself a transcriptional target of Abd-B. These data present a testable hypothesis about the evolution of sexually dimorphic segment number in Diptera.",2012,"Wei Wang, John H Yoder, Wei Wang, John H Yoder"
Basidiomycete Clitocybe nebularis is rich in lectins with insecticidal activities,21556921,10.1007/s00253-011-3236-0,"Basidiomycete mushrooms are a rich source of unique substances, including lectins, that could potentially be useful in biotechnology or biomedical applications. Lectins are a group of carbohydrate-binding proteins with diverse biological activities and functions. Here, we demonstrate the presence of a number of lectins in the basidiomycete mushroom Clitocybe nebularis. Glucose-, galactose-, sucrose-, lactose-, and Sepharose-binding lectins were isolated from fruiting bodies using affinity chromatography on Sepharose-immobilized sugars or on Sepharose. The lectins were characterized biochemically and their binding specificities examined by agglutination and agglutination inhibition assays. In addition, insecticidal and anti-nutritional properties of the lectins were studied against a model organism, fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), and Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata). Of the several basidiomycete mushrooms screened, C. nebularis extract showed the most potent insecticidal activity. Sucrose-binding lectin showed the strongest activity against D. melanogaster, followed by lactose- and galactose-binding lectins. Feeding bioassays with Colorado potato beetle revealed that C. nebularis extract exhibited high anti-nutritional activity against the insect; and of those tested, only lactose-binding lectin, named CNL showed the effect. Mushroom C. nebularis is shown to be rich in a variety of lectins with versatile biological activities, including insecticidal and anti-nutritional effects. C. nebularis lectins could thus have potential for use as natural insecticides.",2011,"Jure Pohleven, Jože Brzin, Lara Vrabec, Adrijana Leonardi, Andrej Cokl, Borut Strukelj, Janko Kos, Jerica Sabotič, Jure Pohleven, Jože Brzin, Lara Vrabec, Adrijana Leonardi, Andrej Cokl, Borut Strukelj, Janko Kos, Jerica Sabotič"
Expression of defense genes in Drosophila evolves under a different selective regime from expression of other genes,21108635,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01197.x,"Genes involved in host-pathogen interactions are expected to be evolving under complex coevolutionary dynamics, including positive directional and/or frequency-dependent selection. Empirical work has largely focused on the evolution of immune genes at the level of the protein sequence. We examine components of genetic variance for transcript abundance of defense genes in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans using a diallel and a round robin breeding design, respectively, and infer modes of evolution from patterns of segregating genetic variation. Defense genes in D. melanogaster are overrepresented relative to nondefense genes among genes with evidence of significant additive variance for expression. Directional selection is expected to deplete additive genetic variance, whereas frequency-dependent selection is expected to maintain additive variance. However, relaxed selection (reduced or no purifying selection) is an alternative interpretation of significant additive variation. Of the three classes of defense genes, the recognition and effector classes show an excess of genes with significant additive variance; whereas signaling genes, in contrast, are overrepresented for dominance variance. Analysis of protein-coding sequences revealed no evidence for an association between additive or dominance variation in expression and directional selection. Both balancing selection driven by host-pathogen coevolution and relaxed selection for expression of uninduced defense genes are viable interpretations of these data.",2011,"Marta L Wayne, Jason Pienaar, Marina Telonis-Scott, Lyvie-Sara Sylvestre, Sergey V Nuzhdin, Lauren M McIntyre, Marta L Wayne, Jason Pienaar, Marina Telonis-Scott, Lyvie-Sara Sylvestre, Sergey V Nuzhdin, Lauren M McIntyre"
Homology modelling of Drosophila cytochrome P450 enzymes associated with insecticide resistance,20583201,10.1002/ps.1986,"Background:
      
    

    
      Overexpression of the cytochrome P450 gene Cyp6g1 confers resistance against DDT and a broad range of other insecticides in Drosophila melanogaster Meig. In the absence of crystal structures of CYP6G1 or complexes with its substrates, structural studies rely on homology modelling and ligand docking to understand P450-substrate interactions.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Homology models are presented for CYP6G1, a P450 associated with resistance to DDT and neonicotinoids, and two other enzymes associated with insecticide resistance in D. melanogaster, CYP12D1 and CYP6A2. The models are based on a template of the X-ray structure of the phylogenetically related human CYP3A4, which is known for its broad substrate specificity. The model of CYP6G1 has a much smaller active site cavity than the template. The cavity is also 'V'-shaped and is lined with hydrophobic residues, showing high shape and chemical complementarity with the molecular characteristics of DDT. Comparison of the DDT-CYP6G1 complex and a non-resistant CYP6A2 homology model implies that tight-fit recognition of this insecticide is important in CYP6G1. The active site can accommodate differently shaped substrates ranging from imidacloprid to malathion but not the pyrethroids permethrin and cyfluthrin.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:

Variation in Drosophila sensory bristle number at 'Evolution Canyon',12688660,10.1017/s0016672302005876,"'Evolution Canyon' on Mount Carmel, Israel, displays highly contrasting physical and biotic environments on a micro-geographic scale, and is a natural laboratory for investigating genetic responses to variable and extreme environments across species. Samples of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans were collected from three sites each on the north- and south-facing slopes of the canyon along altitudinal transects, and one site on the valley floor. Numbers of abdominal and sternopleural sensory bristles were recorded for each of these subpopulations in three thermal environments. In D. simulans, sternopleural bristle number exhibited micro-geographic differentiation between the north- and south-facing slopes, while abdominal bristle number was stable across subpopulations. In D. melanogaster, the magnitudes of the difference in mean sternopleural bristle number between the north- and south-facing slopes and of mean abdominal bristle number along the altitudinal gradients were both conditional on rearing temperature. Thus, the pattern of genetic variation between sites was consistent with underlying heterogeneity of genetic mechanisms for response to the same environmental gradients between traits and sibling species. In contrast, the genetic architecture of bristle number at the level of variation within populations was very similar between species for the same bristle trait, although the two traits differed in the relative contribution of genotype by temperature and genotype by sex interaction.",2002,"Richard F Lyman, Eviatar Nevo, Trudy F C Mackay, Richard F Lyman, Eviatar Nevo, Trudy F C Mackay"
"Sexual and reproductive behaviour of Drosophila melanogaster from a microclimatically interslope differentiated population of ""Evolution Canyon"" (Mount Carmel, Israel)",11703877,10.1098/rspb.2001.1822,"The strong microscale interslope environmental differences in ""Evolution Canyon"" provide an excellent natural model for sympatric speciation. Our previous studies revealed significant slope-specific differences for a fitness complex of Drosophila. This complex involved either adaptation traits (tolerance to high temperature, different viability and longevity pattern) or behavioural differentiation, manifested in habitat choice and non-random mating. This remarkable differentiation has evolved despite a very small interslope distance (a few hundred metres only). Our hypothesis is that strong interslope microclimatic contrast caused differential selection for fitness-related traits accompanied by behavioural differentiation and reinforced by some sexual isolation, which started incipient speciation. Here we describe the results of a systematic analysis of sexual behaviour in a non-choice situation and several reproductive parameters of D. melanogaster populations from the opposite slopes of ""Evolution Canyon"". The evidence indicates that: (i) mate choice derives from differences in mating propensity and discrimination; (ii) females from the milder north-facing slope discriminate strongly against males of the opposite slope; (iii) both sexes of the south-facing slope display distinct reproductive and behavioural patterns with females showing increased fecundity, shorter time before remating and relatively higher receptivity, and males showing higher mating propensity. These patterns represent adaptive life strategies contributing to higher fitness.",2001,"K Iliadi, N Iliadi, E Rashkovetsky, I Minkov, E Nevo, A Korol, K Iliadi, N Iliadi, E Rashkovetsky, I Minkov, E Nevo, A Korol"
The Drosophila heat shock hsr-omega gene: an allele frequency cline detected by quantitative PCR,10555288,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026069,"The hsr-omega gene of Drosophila melanogaster produces RNA products both constitutively and at elevated levels in response to heat stress. A single-nucleotide difference in this gene that has been detected using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) is responsible for an hsr-omegaa/b polymorphism, and selection experiments have indicated an association between the hsr-omegaa allele and susceptibility to heat stress. Since allele frequency estimates for population surveys using PCR and DGGE for single flies would be relatively time-consuming and expensive, we here develop a quantitative competitive-PCR method using mass-grind genomic DNA preparations for this purpose. Geographical and temporal variation of allele frequency at the hsr-omega locus in Australian populations of D. melanogaster are examined. Regular samples from a southern population through a summer season suggested stability of hsr-omegaa frequency. Field populations sampled from a approximately 2,250 km north-south transect along eastern Australia revealed a strong positive association between the frequency of hsr-omegaa and latitude, and marked spatial autocorrelation. Using appropriate analyses, strong association between population differences in hsr-omegaa frequencies and differences in temperature and rainfall measures, after controlling for latitudinal differences, support the idea that the cline in hsr-omegaa frequency may be attributable to some form of climatic selection.",1999,"G McColl, S W McKechnie, G McColl, S W McKechnie"
A His2AvDGFP fusion gene complements a lethal His2AvD mutant allele and provides an in vivo marker for Drosophila chromosome behavior,10390154,10.1089/104454999315178,"We have generated Drosophila melanogaster lines carrying a modified genomic fragment which encodes the D. melanogaster variant H2A.F/Z class histone, His2AvD, fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) of the jellyfish Aequorea victoria. We show here that the fusion protein consists of functional GFP and functional histone His2AvD. The His2AvD portion of the fusion gene was shown to be functional by rescue of His2AvD mutant lethality. Fluorescence of the fusion protein in vivo was observed in embryonic cleavage stage interphase nuclei and on chromosomes as early as cycle 9, correlating with activation of transcription. Unlike transcription factors, the His2AvDGFP protein remained on transcriptionally inactive chromosomes throughout mitosis. Subsequently, fluorescence was observed in nuclei at all stages of embryonic and larval development and in adult somatic tissues, consistent with the distribution of His2AvD observed by immunohistochemical staining. This functional fusion histone acts as an excellent in vivo marker for chromosomes and chromosome behavior and, given the ability of the fusion gene to prevent null-mutant lethality, without disrupting normal cellular functions. The very high level of conservation of the H2A.F/Z family of variant histones suggests that the equivalent fusion protein construct should function equally well in a wide range of organisms.",1999,"M Clarkson, R Saint, M Clarkson, R Saint"
FITNESS SENSITIVITY AND THE CANALIZATION OF LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS,28568425,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1994.tb02186.x,"Canalization is an abstract term that describes unknown developmental mechanisms that reduce phenotypic variation. A trait can be canalized against environmental perturbations (e.g., changes in temperature or nutrient quality), or genetic perturbations (e.g., mutations or recombination); this paper is about genetic canalization. Stabilizing selection should improve the canalization of traits, and the degree of canalization should be positively correlated with the traits' impact on fitness. Experiments testing this idea should measure the canalization of a series of traits whose impact on fitness is known or can be inferred, exclude differences among traits in the number of loci and alleles segregating as an explanation for the pattern of variability found, and distinguish between canalization against genetic and environmental variation. These conditions were met by three experiments within which the variation of fitness components among Drosophila melanogaster lines was measured and among which the genetic contribution to the variation among lines was clearly different. The canalization of the traits increased with their impact on fitness and did not depend on the degree of genetic differences among lines. That the flies used had been transformed by a P-element insert suggests that canalization was also effective against novel genetic variation. The results reported here cannot be explained by the classical hypothesis of reduction in the number of loci segregating for traits with greater impact on fitness and confirm that traits with greater impact on fitness are more strongly canalized. This pattern of canalization reveals an underappreciated role for development in microevolution. There is differential genetic canalization of fitness components in D. melanogaster.",1994,"Stephen C Stearns, Tadeusz J Kawecki, Stephen C Stearns, Tadeusz J Kawecki"
Analysis of immunocytochemical staining patterns in the antennal system of Drosophila melanogaster,8118844,10.1007/BF00305373,"By immunizing mice with homogenized brains, heads, or a mixture of heads and antennae of D. melanogaster, we obtained six monoclonal antibodies (mabs) that bind to the olfactory system of Drosophila with various degrees of specificity. They can be divided into three groups with respect to their staining pattern: (1) The antibodies ca51/2, na21/2, and nb230 label both in the third (olfactory) antennal segment and in the visual ganglia. All of them bind to antennal structures that can be correlated with basiconic sensilla. The antibody ca51/2 labels sensory neurons of these sensilla. In the antenna of the lozenge mutant, which lacks basiconic sensilla, no labeling is present. In Western blots ca51/2 recognizes in the antenna an antigen of 43.5 kDa, which is expressed in the antenna only in the presence of basiconic sensilla. The antibody na21/2 binds to basiconic and coeloconic sensilla, most likely to the apical part of sheath cells. In immunoblots it recognizes in the antenna two antigens of 42.2 kDa and 46.7 kDa. The latter appears to be correlated in the antenna with the presence of basiconic sensilla. (2) The staining pattern of antibody nc10 is associated with the sheath cells of basiconic and coeloconic sensilla. Moreover, nc10 binds to a subset of glomeruli in the antennal lobe. (3) The staining pattern of the antibodies VG2 and I24B5 is restricted to the antenna. I24B5 recognizes coeloconic sensilla and VG2 recognizes both coeloconic and basiconic sensilla.

Genetic variation and genetic load due to the male reproductive component of fitness in Drosophila,6795085,,"The genetic variation and genetic load due to virility, the male reproductive component of fitness, was measured in Drosophila melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura using males homozygous and heterozygous for the second chromosome of each species. Virility was determined in a female-choice, male mating competition experiment where both mating propensity and fertility were taken into account.--The mean virility of the homozygous D. melanogaster males relative to the heterozygous males was 0.50; the relative mean virility of the quasinormal homozygotes was 0.56. The mean virility of the homozygous D. pseudoobscura males relative to the heterozygous males was 0.70; the relative mean virility of the nonsterile homozygotes was 0.72, and of the quasinormal homozygotes, 0.68.--Depending on the species and chromosome sampled, fertile homozygous males had a mean virility 15 to 50% lower than the mean viability of individuals homozygous for a chromosome with quasinormal viability. The genetic load due to virility was also greater than that due to the female reproductive component. This higher level of hidden genetic variation (or genetic load) indicates that the results of Prout (1971a, b) and Bundgaard and Christian (1972), where the virility component of fitness dominated the dynamics of an artificial polymorphism, may be more general and that virility may dominate the dynamics of natural polymorphisms as well.",1981,"J G Brittnacher, J G Brittnacher"

As first noted by Puro and Nokkala [Puro, J., Nokkala, S., 1977. Meiotic segregation of chromosomes in Drosophila melanogaster oocytes. A cytological approach. Chromosoma 63, 273-286], nonexchange chromosomes move precociously towards the poles following formation of a bipolar spindle. Indeed, metaphase arrest has been previously defined as the stage at which nonexchange homologs are symmetrically positioned between the main chromosome mass and the poles of the spindle. Here we use studies of both fixed images and living oocytes to show that the stage in which achiasmate chromosomes are separated from the main mass does not in fact define metaphase arrest, but rather is a component of an extended prometaphase. At the end of prometaphase, the nonexchange chromosomes retract into the main chromosome mass, which is tightly repackaged with properly co-oriented centromeres. This repackaged state is the true metaphase arrest configuration in Drosophila female meiosis.",2009,"William D Gilliland, Stacie F Hughes, Dana R Vietti, R Scott Hawley, William D Gilliland, Stacie F Hughes, Dana R Vietti, R Scott Hawley"

Fly-on-a-Chip: Microfluidics for Drosophila melanogaster Studies,31965192,10.1093/intbio/zyz037,"The fruit fly or Drosophila melanogaster has been used as a promising model organism in genetics, developmental and behavioral studies as well as in the fields of neuroscience, pharmacology, and toxicology. Not only all the developmental stages of Drosophila, including embryonic, larval, and adulthood stages, have been used in experimental in vivo biology, but also the organs, tissues, and cells extracted from this model have found applications in in vitro assays. However, the manual manipulation, cellular investigation and behavioral phenotyping techniques utilized in conventional Drosophila-based in vivo and in vitro assays are mostly time-consuming, labor-intensive, and low in throughput. Moreover, stimulation of the organism with external biological, chemical, or physical signals requires precision in signal delivery, while quantification of neural and behavioral phenotypes necessitates optical and physical accessibility to Drosophila.

The role of Drosophila Piezo in mechanical nociception,22343891,10.1038/nature10801,"Transduction of mechanical stimuli by receptor cells is essential for senses such as hearing, touch and pain. Ion channels have a role in neuronal mechanotransduction in invertebrates; however, functional conservation of these ion channels in mammalian mechanotransduction is not observed. For example, no mechanoreceptor potential C (NOMPC), a member of transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family, acts as a mechanotransducer in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans; however, it has no orthologues in mammals. Degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) family members are mechanotransducers in C. elegans and potentially in D. melanogaster; however, a direct role of its mammalian homologues in sensing mechanical force has not been shown. Recently, Piezo1 (also known as Fam38a) and Piezo2 (also known as Fam38b) were identified as components of mechanically activated channels in mammals. The Piezo family are evolutionarily conserved transmembrane proteins. It is unknown whether they function in mechanical sensing in vivo and, if they do, which mechanosensory modalities they mediate. Here we study the physiological role of the single Piezo member in D. melanogaster (Dmpiezo; also known as CG8486). Dmpiezo expression in human cells induces mechanically activated currents, similar to its mammalian counterparts. Behavioural responses to noxious mechanical stimuli were severely reduced in Dmpiezo knockout larvae, whereas responses to another noxious stimulus or touch were not affected. Knocking down Dmpiezo in sensory neurons that mediate nociception and express the DEG/ENaC ion channel pickpocket (ppk) was sufficient to impair responses to noxious mechanical stimuli. Furthermore, expression of Dmpiezo in these same neurons rescued the phenotype of the constitutive Dmpiezo knockout larvae. Accordingly, electrophysiological recordings from ppk-positive neurons revealed a Dmpiezo-dependent, mechanically activated current. Finally, we found that Dmpiezo and ppk function in parallel pathways in ppk-positive cells, and that mechanical nociception is abolished in the absence of both channels. These data demonstrate the physiological relevance of the Piezo family in mechanotransduction in vivo, supporting a role of Piezo proteins in mechanosensory nociception.",2012,"Sung Eun Kim, Bertrand Coste, Abhishek Chadha, Boaz Cook, Ardem Patapoutian, Sung Eun Kim, Bertrand Coste, Abhishek Chadha, Boaz Cook, Ardem Patapoutian"
Mapping quantitative trait loci affecting variation in Drosophila triacylglycerol storage,16222063,10.1038/oby.2005.196,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Recent genetic studies indicate that Drosophila melanogaster could be a powerful model to identify genes involved in mammalian adipocyte differentiation and fat storage. The objective of our study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that contribute to variation in triacylglycerol (TAG) storage in two D. melanogaster laboratory strains.
    

    
  


        Research methods and procedures:
      
    

    
      We used two genetic mapping procedures to identify loci with main and epistatic effects on TAG storage. First, using 68 recombinant inbred lines derived from the unrelated Oregon R and Russian 2b strains, we mapped the location of QTLs affecting TAG storage using both composite interval mapping and Bayesian epistatic methods. Second, we used the quantitative deficiency mapping procedure to identify candidate genes affecting this trait within one of the QTLs identified on the second chromosome. For both mapping experiments, flies were cultured in standard conditions. TAG content of 4- to 5-day-old flies, adjusted for live body mass and total proteins, was used as the phenotypic measure.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Multiple QTLs associated with variation in TAG storage were identified by the genome-wide recombination mapping method, and some of them were sex-specific. The QTLs had main effects, but a male-specific epistatic interaction between two QTLs was also found. Finally, two closely linked QTLs were detected by deficiency mapping at 57E1-57E3 and 57E4-57F1 on chromosome 2, the first of which causes female-specific variation in TAG between the Oregon R and 2b strains.
    

    
  


        Discussion:

Administration of PQ significantly increased the Drome-AKH level in w(1118) and AdoR(1) larvae; however, this was not accompanied by a simultaneous increase in Akh gene expression. In contrast, PQ significantly increased the expression of the glutathione S-transferase D1 (GstD1) gene. The presence of both a functional adenosine receptor and AKH seem to be important for the proper control of GstD1 gene expression under oxidative stress, however, the latter appears to play more dominant role. On the other hand, differences in glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity among the strains, and between untreated and PQ-treated groups were minimal. In addition, the glutathione level was significantly lower in all untreated AKH- or AdoR-deficient mutant flies as compared with the untreated control w(1118) flies and further declined following treatment with PQ. All oxidative stress characteristics modified by mutations in Akh gene were restored or even improved by 'rescue' mutation in flies which ectopically express Akh. Thus, the results of the present study demonstrate the important roles of AKH and adenosine in the anti-stress response elicited by PQ in a D. melanogaster model, and provide the first evidence for the involvement of adenosine in the anti-oxidative stress response in insects.",2016,"Milada Zemanová, Tereza Stašková, Dalibor Kodrík, Milada Zemanová, Tereza Stašková, Dalibor Kodrík"
Genetic studies on heterochromatin in Drosophila melanogaster and their implications for the functions of satellite DNA,416935,10.1007/BF00285817,"In Drosophila melanogaster the centromeric heterochromatin of all chromosomes consists almost entirely of several different satellite DNA sequences. In view of this we have examined by genetic means the meiotic consequences of X chromosomes with partial deletions of their heterochromatin, and have found that the amount and position of recombination on each heterochromatically deleted X is substantially different from that of a normal X. It appears that the amount of heterochromatin is important in modifying the ""centromere effect"" on recombination.--In all the deleted Xs tested, chromosome segregation is not appreciably altered from that of a nondeleted control chromosome. Thus satellite DNA does not appear to be an important factor in determining the regular segregation of sex chromosomes in Drosophila. Additionally, since X chromosomes with massive satellite DNA deficiencies are able to participate in a chromocenter within salivary gland nuclei, a major role of satellite DNA in chromocenter formation in this tissue is also quite unlikely.--In order to examine the mechanisms by which the amount of satellite DNA is increased or decreased in vivo, we have measured cytologically the frequency of spontaneous sister chromatid exchanges in a ring Y chromosome which is entirely heterochromatic and consists almost exclusively of satellite DNA. In larval neuroblast cells the frequency of spontaneous SCE in this Y is approximately 0.3% per cell division. Since there is no meiotic recombination in D. melanogaster males and since meiotic recombination in the female does not occur in heterochromatin, our results provide a minimum estimate of the in vivo frequency of SCE in C-banded heterochromatin (which is predominantly simple sequence DNA), without the usual complications of substituted base analogs, incorporated radioactive label or substantial genetic content.--We emphasise that: (a) satellite DNA is not implicated in any major way in recognition processes such as meiotic homologue recognition or chromocenter formation in salivaries, (b) there is likely to be continuous variation in the amount of satellite DNA between individuals of a species; and (c) the amount of satellite DNA can have a crucial functional role in the meiotic recombination system.",1978,"M Yamamoto, G L Miklos, M Yamamoto, G L Miklos"

Drosophila melanogaster as a model for human intestinal infection and pathology,21183483,10.1242/dmm.003970,"Recent findings concerning Drosophila melanogaster intestinal pathology suggest that this model is well suited for the study of intestinal stem cell physiology during aging, stress and infection. Despite the physiological divergence between vertebrates and insects, the modeling of human intestinal diseases is possible in Drosophila because of the high degree of conservation between Drosophila and mammals with respect to the signaling pathways that control intestinal development, regeneration and disease. Furthermore, the genetic amenability of Drosophila makes it an advantageous model species. The well-studied intestinal stem cell lineage, as well as the tools available for its manipulation in vivo, provide a promising framework that can be used to elucidate many aspects of human intestinal pathology. In this Perspective, we discuss recent advances in the study of Drosophila intestinal infection and pathology, and briefly review the parallels and differences between human and Drosophila intestinal regeneration and disease.",2011,"Yiorgos Apidianakis, Laurence G Rahme, Yiorgos Apidianakis, Laurence G Rahme"
"Synaptonemal Complex-Deficient Drosophila melanogaster Females Exhibit Rare DSB Repair Events, Recurrent Copy-Number Variation, and an Increased Rate of de Novo Transposable Element Movement",31882405,10.1534/g3.119.400853,"Genetic stability depends on the maintenance of a variety of chromosome structures and the precise repair of DNA breaks. During meiosis, programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) made in prophase I are normally repaired as gene conversions or crossovers. DSBs can also be made by other mechanisms, such as the movement of transposable elements (TEs), which must also be resolved. Incorrect repair of these DNA lesions can lead to mutations, copy-number changes, translocations, and/or aneuploid gametes. In Drosophila melanogaster, as in most organisms, meiotic DSB repair occurs in the presence of a rapidly evolving multiprotein structure called the synaptonemal complex (SC). Here, whole-genome sequencing is used to investigate the fate of meiotic DSBs in D. melanogaster mutant females lacking functional SC, to assay for de novo CNV formation, and to examine the role of the SC in transposable element movement in flies. The data indicate that, in the absence of SC, copy-number variation still occurs and meiotic DSB repair by gene conversion occurs infrequently. Remarkably, an 856-kilobase de novo CNV was observed in two unrelated individuals of different genetic backgrounds and was identical to a CNV recovered in a previous wild-type study, suggesting that recurrent formation of large CNVs occurs in Drosophila. In addition, the rate of novel TE insertion was markedly higher than wild type in one of two SC mutants tested, suggesting that SC proteins may contribute to the regulation of TE movement and insertion in the genome. Overall, this study provides novel insight into the role that the SC plays in genome stability and provides clues as to why the sequence, but not structure, of SC proteins is rapidly evolving.",2020,"Danny E Miller, Danny E Miller"
Identification and characterization of novel conserved RNA structures in Drosophila,30537930,10.1186/s12864-018-5234-4,"Background:
      
    

    
      Comparative genomics approaches have facilitated the discovery of many novel non-coding and structured RNAs (ncRNAs). The increasing availability of related genomes now makes it possible to systematically search for compensatory base changes - and thus for conserved secondary structures - even in genomic regions that are poorly alignable in the primary sequence. The wealth of available transcriptome data can add valuable insight into expression and possible function for new ncRNA candidates. Earlier work identifying ncRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster made use of sequence-based alignments and employed a sliding window approach, inevitably biasing identification toward RNAs encoded in the more conserved parts of the genome.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      To search for conserved RNA structures (CRSs) that may not be highly conserved in sequence and to assess the expression of CRSs, we conducted a genome-wide structural alignment screen of 27 insect genomes including D. melanogaster and integrated this with an extensive set of tiling array data. The structural alignment screen revealed ∼30,000 novel candidate CRSs at an estimated false discovery rate of less than 10%. With more than one quarter of all individual CRS motifs showing sequence identities below 60%, the predicted CRSs largely complement the findings of sliding window approaches applied previously. While a sixth of the CRSs were ubiquitously expressed, we found that most were expressed in specific developmental stages or cell lines. Notably, most statistically significant enrichment of CRSs were observed in pupae, mainly in exons of untranslated regions, promotors, enhancers, and long ncRNAs. Interestingly, cell lines were found to express a different set of CRSs than were found in vivo. Only a small fraction of intergenic CRSs were co-expressed with the adjacent protein coding genes, which suggests that most intergenic CRSs are independent genetic units.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study provides a more comprehensive view of the ncRNA transcriptome in fly as well as evidence for differential expression of CRSs during development and in cell lines.",2018,"Rebecca Kirsch, Stefan E Seemann, Walter L Ruzzo, Stephen M Cohen, Peter F Stadler, Jan Gorodkin, Rebecca Kirsch, Stefan E Seemann, Walter L Ruzzo, Stephen M Cohen, Peter F Stadler, Jan Gorodkin"
Searching for motifs in the behaviour of larval Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans reveals continuity between behavioural states,26609067,10.1098/rsif.2015.0899,"We present a novel method for the unsupervised discovery of behavioural motifs in larval Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. A motif is defined as a particular sequence of postures that recurs frequently. The animal's changing posture is represented by an eigenshape time series, and we look for motifs in this time series. To find motifs, the eigenshape time series is segmented, and the segments clustered using spline regression. Unlike previous approaches, our method can classify sequences of unequal duration as the same motif. The behavioural motifs are used as the basis of a probabilistic behavioural annotator, the eigenshape annotator (ESA). Probabilistic annotation avoids rigid threshold values and allows classification uncertainty to be quantified. We apply eigenshape annotation to both larval Drosophila and C. elegans and produce a good match to hand annotation of behavioural states. However, we find many behavioural events cannot be unambiguously classified. By comparing the results with ESA of an artificial agent's behaviour, we argue that the ambiguity is due to greater continuity between behavioural states than is generally assumed for these organisms.",2015,"Balázs Szigeti, Ajinkya Deogade, Barbara Webb, Balázs Szigeti, Ajinkya Deogade, Barbara Webb"
Does the female life span exceed that of the male? A study in Drosophila melanogaster,6413302,10.1159/000213136,"A survey of all the papers relating to life span in Drosophila melanogaster published in Experimental Gerontology from its origin in 1964 to 1981 shows that, contrary to a common belief, the mean life span of females exceeds that of males in only approximately 50% of the cases. It is shown that mean life span, as it is measured in most experiments, is a poor estimate of the potential life span of a Drosophila strain. However, the analysis of four extensive studies of Drosophila melanogaster life span strongly suggests that the potential (or maximal) life span is consistently higher for females than it is for males. That analysis also shows that, vis-à-vis the controlled or uncontrolled variations of the environment, the males have a broader norm of reaction or, in other words, a smaller homeostasis than the females. A model, mainly based on these two results, allows us to explain how the mean life span of males is so often higher than that of females.",1983,"F A Lints, M Bourgois, A Delalieux, J Stoll, C V Lints, F A Lints, M Bourgois, A Delalieux, J Stoll, C V Lints"

Variation in antiviral protection mediated by different Wolbachia strains in Drosophila simulans,19911047,10.1371/journal.ppat.1000656,"Drosophila C virus (DCV) is a natural pathogen of Drosophila and a useful model for studying antiviral defences. The Drosophila host is also commonly infected with the widespread endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia pipientis. When DCV coinfects Wolbachia-infected D. melanogaster, virus particles accumulate more slowly and virus induced mortality is substantially delayed. Considering that Wolbachia is estimated to infect up to two-thirds of all insect species, the observed protective effects of Wolbachia may extend to a range of both beneficial and pest insects, including insects that vector important viral diseases of humans, animals and plants. Currently, Wolbachia-mediated antiviral protection has only been described from a limited number of very closely related strains that infect D. melanogaster. We used D. simulans and its naturally occurring Wolbachia infections to test the generality of the Wolbachia-mediated antiviral protection. We generated paired D. simulans lines either uninfected or infected with five different Wolbachia strains. Each paired fly line was challenged with DCV and Flock House virus. Significant antiviral protection was seen for some but not all of the Wolbachia strain-fly line combinations tested. In some cases, protection from virus-induced mortality was associated with a delay in virus accumulation, but some Wolbachia-infected flies were tolerant to high titres of DCV. The Wolbachia strains that did protect occurred at comparatively high density within the flies and were most closely related to the D. melanogaster Wolbachia strain wMel. These results indicate that Wolbachia-mediated antiviral protection is not ubiquitous, a finding that is important for understanding the distribution of Wolbachia and virus in natural insect populations.",2009,"Sheree E Osborne, Yi San Leong, Scott L O'Neill, Karyn N Johnson, Sheree E Osborne, Yi San Leong, Scott L O'Neill, Karyn N Johnson"

Its 100,000-neuron brain is a large but tractable target for comprehensive neural circuit mapping. Only electron microscopy (EM) enables complete, unbiased mapping of synaptic connectivity; however, the fly brain is too large for conventional EM. We developed a custom high-throughput EM platform and imaged the entire brain of an adult female fly at synaptic resolution. To validate the dataset, we traced brain-spanning circuitry involving the mushroom body (MB), which has been extensively studied for its role in learning. All inputs to Kenyon cells (KCs), the intrinsic neurons of the MB, were mapped, revealing a previously unknown cell type, postsynaptic partners of KC dendrites, and unexpected clustering of olfactory projection neurons. These reconstructions show that this freely available EM volume supports mapping of brain-spanning circuits, which will significantly accelerate Drosophila neuroscience.

Functional analysis of Drosophila melanogaster BRCA2 in DNA repair,17822964,10.1016/j.dnarep.2007.07.013,"The human BRCA2 cancer susceptibility protein functions in double-strand DNA break repair by homologous recombination and this pathway is conserved in the fly Drosophila melanogaster. Although a potential Drosophila melanogaster BRCA2 orthologue (dmbrca2; CG30169) has been identified by sequence similarity, no functional data addressing the role of this protein in DNA repair is available. Here, we demonstrate that depletion of dmbrca2 from Drosophila cells induces sensitivity to DNA damage induced by irradiation or treatment with hydroxyurea. Dmbrca2 physically interacts with dmrad51 (spnA) and the two proteins become recruited to nuclear foci after DNA damage. A functional assay for DNA repair demonstrated that in flies dmbrca2 plays a role in double-strand break repair by gene conversion. Finally, we show that depletion of dmbrca2 in cells is synthetically lethal with deficiency in other DNA repair proteins including dmparp. The conservation of the function of BRCA2 in Drosophila will allow the analysis of this key DNA repair protein in a genetically tractable organism potentially illuminating mechanisms of carcinogenesis and aiding the development of therapeutic agents.",2008,"Rachel Brough, Debbie Wei, Sophie Leulier, Christopher J Lord, Yikang S Rong, Alan Ashworth, Rachel Brough, Debbie Wei, Sophie Leulier, Christopher J Lord, Yikang S Rong, Alan Ashworth"
Immune response of Drosophila melanogaster to infection with the flagellate parasite Crithidia spp,11164335,10.1016/s0965-1748(00)00096-5,"Insects are able to recognize invading microorganisms and to mount an immune response to bacterial and fungal infections. Recently, the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a promising invertebrate model to investigate innate immunity because of its well-characterized genetics. Insects are also vectors of numerous parasites which can trigger an immune response. We have investigated the interaction of Drosophila melanogaster with the flagellate protozoan Crithidia spp. We show that a per os parasitic infection triggers the synthesis of several antimicrobial peptides. By reverse phase HPLC and mass spectrometry, peptides were shown to be present in the hemolymph and not in the gut tissue, suggesting the presence of immune messengers between the site of the infection, namely the gut, and the fat body, the main site of synthesis for antimicrobial peptides. Interestingly, we have identified one molecule which is specifically induced in the hemolymph after infection with Crithidia, but not with bacteria, suggesting that Drosophila can discriminate between pathogens. When flagellates were injected into the hemolymph, a low synthesis of antimicrobial peptides was observed together with phagocytosis of parasites by circulating hemocytes. The data presented here suggest that Drosophila-Crithidia spp. represents an interesting model to study host defense against protozoan parasites.",2001,"N Boulanger, L Ehret-Sabatier, R Brun, D Zachary, P Bulet, J L Imler, N Boulanger, L Ehret-Sabatier, R Brun, D Zachary, P Bulet, J L Imler"
Two functionally distinct CYP4G genes of Anopheles gambiae contribute to cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis,31051237,10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.04.018,"Cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) biosynthesis is a major pathway of insect physiology. In Drosophila melanogaster the cytochrome P450 CYP4G1 catalyses the insect-specific oxidative decarbonylation step, while in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, two CYP4G paralogues, CYP4G16 and CYP4G17 are present. Analysis of the subcellular localization of CYP4G17 and CYP4G16 in larval and pupal stages revealed that CYP4G16 preserves its PM localization across developmental stages analyzed; however CYPG17 is differentially localized in two distinct types of pupal oenocytes, presumably oenocytes of larval and adult developmental specificity. Western blot analysis showed the presence of two CYP4G17 forms, potentially associated with each oenocyte type. Both An. gambiae CYP4Gs were expressed in D. melanogaster flies in a Cyp4g1 silenced background in order to functionally characterize them in vivo. CYP4G16, CYP4G17 or their combination rescued the lethal phenotype of Cyp4g1-knock down flies, demonstrating that CYP4G17 is also a functional decarbonylase, albeit of somewhat lower efficiency than CYP4G16 in Drosophila. Flies expressing mosquito CYP4G16 and/or CYP4G17 produced similar CHC profiles to 'wild-type' flies expressing the endogenous CYP4G1, but they also produce very long-chain dimethyl-branched CHCs not detectable in wild type flies, suggesting that the specificity of the CYP4G enzymes contributes to determine the complexity of the CHC blend. In conclusion, both An. gambiae CYP4G enzymes contribute to the unique Anopheles CHC profile, which has been associated to defense, adult desiccation tolerance, insecticide penetration rate and chemical communication.",2019,"Mary Kefi, Vasileia Balabanidou, Vassilis Douris, Gareth Lycett, René Feyereisen, John Vontas, Mary Kefi, Vasileia Balabanidou, Vassilis Douris, Gareth Lycett, René Feyereisen, John Vontas"
Prolonged Storage Increases Virulence of Steinernema Entomopathogenic Nematodes Toward Drosophila Larvae,30088785,10.1645/18-91,"Entomopathogenic nematodes are excellent organisms for dissecting the molecular basis of parasitism and probing the insect innate immune system. The nematode parasite Steinernema carpocapsae is a potent pathogen of insects that has emerged recently as a model for parasitic infection and anti-nematode immune signaling and response. The nematodes are mutualistically associated with the bacteria Xenorhabdus nematophila, which are also pathogenic to insects. Separation of nematodes from their associated bacteria facilitates mechanistic studies focusing on the impact of the parasites without considering the contribution of their bacterial partners. An important aspect in insect infection experiments with entomopathogenic nematodes includes the storage duration of the parasites. Here we have infected larvae of the model insect Drosophila melanogaster with S. carpocapsae nematodes that had been stored for 3 wk or 3 mo. Survival data consistently revealed that infective juveniles with prolonged storage exhibit substantially increased virulence toward D. melanogaster larvae compared with those that had been stored for a shorter time, and the presence of mutualistic X. nematophila in the nematodes does not influence this result. Although the basis for this effect is currently unknown, these surprising findings indicate that prolonged nematode storage can markedly alter virulence. This is significant knowledge that should be taken into account in functional assays involving infection with parasitic nematodes. Future efforts will focus on the identification and characterization of the factors that might determine the interrelationship between prolonged storage and virulence in nematode parasites.",2018,"Shruti Yadav, Ioannis Eleftherianos, Shruti Yadav, Ioannis Eleftherianos"
Validity of thermal ramping assays used to assess thermal tolerance in arthropods,22427876,10.1371/journal.pone.0032758,"Proper assessment of environmental resistance of animals is critical for the ability of researchers to understand how variation in environmental conditions influence population and species abundance. This is also the case for studies of upper thermal limits in insects, where researchers studying animals under laboratory conditions must select appropriate methodology on which conclusions can be drawn. Ideally these methods should precisely estimate the trait of interest and also be biological meaningful. In an attempt to develop such tests it has been proposed that thermal ramping assays are useful assays for small insects because they incorporate an ecologically relevant gradual temperature change. However, recent model-based papers have suggested that estimates of thermal resistance may be strongly confounded by simultaneous starvation and dehydration stress. In the present study we empirically test these model predictions using two sets of independent experiments. We clearly demonstrate that results from ramping assays of small insects (Drosophila melanogaster) are not compromised by starvation- or dehydration-stress. Firstly we show that the mild disturbance of water and energy balance of D. melanogaster experienced during the ramping tests does not confound heat tolerance estimates. Secondly we show that flies pre-exposed to starvation and dehydration have ""normal"" heat tolerance and that resistance to heat stress is independent of the energetic and water status of the flies. On the basis of our results we discuss the assumptions used in recent model papers and present arguments as to why the ramping assay is both a valid and ecologically relevant way to measure thermal resistance in insects.",2012,"Johannes Overgaard, Torsten Nygaard Kristensen, Jesper Givskov Sørensen, Johannes Overgaard, Torsten Nygaard Kristensen, Jesper Givskov Sørensen"
Phylogeny of the Oriental Drosophila melanogaster species group: a multilocus reconstruction,12396591,10.1080/10635150290102410,"The melanogaster species group of Drosophila (subgenus Sophophora) has long been a favored model for evolutionary studies because of its morphological and ecological diversity and wide geographic distribution. However, phylogenetic relationships among species and subgroups within this lineage are not well understood. We reconstructed the phylogeny of 17 species representing 7 ""oriental"" species subgroups, which are especially closely related to D. melanogaster. We used DNA sequences of four nuclear and two mitochondrial loci in an attempt to obtain the best possible estimate of species phylogeny and to assess the extent and sources of remaining uncertainties. Comparison of trees derived from single-gene data sets allowed us to identify several strongly supported clades, which were also consistently seen in combined analyses. The relationships among these clades are less certain. The combined data set contains data partitions that are incongruent with each other. Trees reconstructed from the combined data set and from internally homogenous data sets consisting of three or four genes each differ at several deep nodes. The total data set tree is fully resolved and strongly supported at most nodes. Statistical tests indicated that this tree is compatible with all individual and combined data sets. Therefore, we accepted this tree as the most likely model of historical relationships. We compared the new molecular phylogeny to earlier estimates based on morphology and chromosome structure and discuss its taxonomic and evolutionary implications.",2002,"Artyom Kopp, John R True, Artyom Kopp, John R True"
Immune suppressive virus-like particles in a Drosophila parasitoid: significance of their intraspecific morphological variations,8811846,10.1017/s0031182000081981,"The Eucoilid parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi is able to suppress its host Drosophila melanogaster immune reaction. Some strains, however, are non-immune suppressive to that host. Virus-like particles (VLPs) responsible for the immune suppressive ability were investigated in different strains of L. boulardi with histochemical and ultrastructural techniques. Membrane-bound particles containing vesicles were observed in the reservoir of the long gland and also in the egg canal of the ovipositor. These particles are homologous with the immune suppressive VLPs already described in the reservoir of L. heterotoma. Similarities were also observed with the L2 particles described previously around the chorion of the parasitoid egg after infestation. A weak positive DNA specific histochemical reaction was observed inside the reservoir and at the ultrastructural level. Feulgen-derived techniques demonstrated that the reaction was localized inside the particles. The morphology of the particles as well as the immune suppressive ability varied between strains. Two morphotypes of VLPs are described; the 'Is' morphotype (always observed in immune suppressive or Is strains) and the 'NIs' morphotype (observed in the non-immune suppressive or NIs strain). The hybrids between Is and NIs strains produce a third type of particle, the 'HIs' morphotype with half-immune suppressive ability and intermediate morphology. The origin of the particles' immune suppressive activity against D. melanogaster is discussed within the scope of host specificity.",1996,"S Dupas, M Brehelin, F Frey, Y Carton, S Dupas, M Brehelin, F Frey, Y Carton"
Nucleotide sequence of the Drosophila glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase gene and comparison with the homologous human gene,2838391,10.1016/0378-1119(88)90530-6,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) has a major role in NADPH production and is found in almost all cell types. The structural gene for G6PD is X-linked in Drosophila melanogaster, as it is in most eukaryotic organisms, and due to its ubiquitous expression, it can be considered a typical 'housekeeping' gene. Here we present the complete nucleotide (nt) sequence of G6PD cDNAs as well as the genomic copy of the G6PD gene. The G6PD gene has three introns so that the protein-coding region is divided into four segments. The 5'-end of mature G6PD mRNA is located 289 +/- 1 nt upstream from the start codon. The sequence upstream from the transcription start point is G + T-rich and contains no commonly found transcription regulatory elements, such as a TATA box or GGGCGG sequence. D. melanogaster G6PD is 65% homologous with the human G6PD protein but has no homology with the human sequence for the first 42 amino acid residues. The G6PD gene was shown to be active when transduced to autosomal positions. For each transformant, G6PD activity in both male and female adults was not significantly different, indicating that the transduced gene, unlike the resident G6PD, is not dosage-compensated in males.",1988,"D Fouts, R Ganguly, A G Gutierrez, J C Lucchesi, J E Manning, D Fouts, R Ganguly, A G Gutierrez, J C Lucchesi, J E Manning"
Reproductive strategy in Drosophila melanogaster: Significance of a genetic divergence between temperate and tropical populations,28311735,10.1007/BF00389008,"Reproductive capacities of tropical and temperate populations of D. melanogaster were compared using three complementary techniques: (1) measure of egg production by females grown in the laboratory under uncrowded conditions and provided as adults with abundant food; (2) study of egg production of flies of unknown ages, collected in nature and then kept in similar conditions; and (3) analysis of ovarian activity of wild females dissected just after their capture.Tropical populations showed a lower fecundity in the laboratory and this was also observed in laboratory reared adults. On the average, flies also appeared to be older in the tropics than in temperate countries. These data, together with ecological observations showing that tropical populations live in a more predictable and stable environment, suggest that temperature populations are r-selected, while tropical ones are K-selected. The study of ovarian activity of wild females failed however to confirm this expectation. Tropical flies, which have a lower genetic fecundity, generally appeared to produce more propagules than did temperate flies. Such a contradiction shows how the ideas of r- and K-selection are difficult to apply to natural populations of Drosophila. Population density and interindividual competition are probably not the main selective forces in nature. Attention must also be paid to the necessity of exploring the environment to find resources, to the role of predation and parasitism, and to the occurrence in temperate countries of seasonal fluctuations with different selective pressures on successive generations.",1982,"J Boulétreau-Merle, R Allemand, Y Cohet, J R David, J Boulétreau-Merle, R Allemand, Y Cohet, J R David"
EYES ABSENT and TIMELESS integrate photoperiodic and temperature cues to regulate seasonal physiology in Drosophila,32541062,10.1073/pnas.2004262117,"Organisms possess photoperiodic timing mechanisms to detect variations in day length and temperature as the seasons progress. The nature of the molecular mechanisms interpreting and signaling these environmental changes to elicit downstream neuroendocrine and physiological responses are just starting to emerge. Here, we demonstrate that, in Drosophila melanogaster, EYES ABSENT (EYA) acts as a seasonal sensor by interpreting photoperiodic and temperature changes to trigger appropriate physiological responses. We observed that tissue-specific genetic manipulation of eya expression is sufficient to disrupt the ability of flies to sense seasonal cues, thereby altering the extent of female reproductive dormancy. Specifically, we observed that EYA proteins, which peak at night in short photoperiod and accumulate at higher levels in the cold, promote reproductive dormancy in female D. melanogaster Furthermore, we provide evidence indicating that the role of EYA in photoperiodism and temperature sensing is aided by the stabilizing action of the light-sensitive circadian clock protein TIMELESS (TIM). We postulate that increased stability and level of TIM at night under short photoperiod together with the production of cold-induced and light-insensitive TIM isoforms facilitate EYA accumulation in winter conditions. This is supported by our observations that tim null mutants exhibit reduced incidence of reproductive dormancy in simulated winter conditions, while flies overexpressing tim show an increased incidence of reproductive dormancy even in long photoperiod.",2020,"Antoine Abrieux, Yongbo Xue, Yao Cai, Kyle M Lewald, Hoang Nhu Nguyen, Yong Zhang, Joanna C Chiu, Antoine Abrieux, Yongbo Xue, Yao Cai, Kyle M Lewald, Hoang Nhu Nguyen, Yong Zhang, Joanna C Chiu"
Direct benefits of choosing a high-fitness mate can offset the indirect costs associated with intralocus sexual conflict,28369895,10.1111/evo.13240,"Intralocus sexual conflict generates a cost to mate choice: high-fitness partners transmit genetic variation that confers lower fitness to offspring of the opposite sex. Our earlier work in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, revealed that these indirect genetic costs were sufficient to reverse potential ""good genes"" benefits of sexual selection. However, mate choice can also confer direct fitness benefits by inducing larger numbers of progeny. Here, we consider whether direct benefits through enhanced fertility could offset the costs associated with intralocus sexual conflict in D. melanogaster. Using hemiclonal analysis, we found that females mated to high-fitness males produced 11% more offspring compared to those mated to low-fitness males, and high-fitness females produced 34% more offspring than low-fitness females. These direct benefits more than offset the reduction in offspring fitness caused by intralocus sexual conflict, creating a net fitness benefit for each sex to pairing with a high-fitness partner. Our findings highlight the need to consider both direct and indirect effects when investigating the fitness impacts of mate choice. Direct fitness benefits may shelter sexually antagonistic alleles from selection, suggesting a novel mechanism for the maintenance of fitness variation.",2017,"Alison Pischedda, Adam K Chippindale, Alison Pischedda, Adam K Chippindale"
Hybrid Dysgenesis in Drosophila simulans Associated with a Rapid Invasion of the P-Element,26982327,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005920,"In a classic example of the invasion of a species by a selfish genetic element, the P-element was horizontally transferred from a distantly related species into Drosophila melanogaster. Despite causing 'hybrid dysgenesis', a syndrome of abnormal phenotypes that include sterility, the P-element spread globally in the course of a few decades in D. melanogaster. Until recently, its sister species, including D. simulans, remained P-element free. Here, we find a hybrid dysgenesis-like phenotype in the offspring of crosses between D. simulans strains collected in different years; a survey of 181 strains shows that around 20% of strains induce hybrid dysgenesis. Using genomic and transcriptomic data, we show that this dysgenesis-inducing phenotype is associated with the invasion of the P-element. To characterize this invasion temporally and geographically, we survey 631 D. simulans strains collected on three continents and over 27 years for the presence of the P-element. We find that the D. simulans P-element invasion occurred rapidly and nearly simultaneously in the regions surveyed, with strains containing P-elements being rare in 2006 and common by 2014. Importantly, as evidenced by their resistance to the hybrid dysgenesis phenotype, strains collected from the latter phase of this invasion have adapted to suppress the worst effects of the P-element.",2016,"Tom Hill, Christian Schlötterer, Andrea J Betancourt, Tom Hill, Christian Schlötterer, Andrea J Betancourt"
Lifespan and Stress Resistance in Drosophila with Overexpressed DNA Repair Genes,26477511,10.1038/srep15299,"DNA repair declines with age and correlates with longevity in many animal species. In this study, we investigated the effects of GAL4-induced overexpression of genes implicated in DNA repair on lifespan and resistance to stress factors in Drosophila melanogaster. Stress factors included hyperthermia, oxidative stress, and starvation. Overexpression was either constitutive or conditional and either ubiquitous or tissue-specific (nervous system). Overexpressed genes included those involved in recognition of DNA damage (homologs of HUS1, CHK2), nucleotide and base excision repair (homologs of XPF, XPC and AP-endonuclease-1), and repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (homologs of BRCA2, XRCC3, KU80 and WRNexo). The overexpression of different DNA repair genes led to both positive and negative effects on lifespan and stress resistance. Effects were dependent on GAL4 driver, stage of induction, sex, and role of the gene in the DNA repair process. While the constitutive/neuron-specific and conditional/ubiquitous overexpression of DNA repair genes negatively impacted lifespan and stress resistance, the constitutive/ubiquitous and conditional/neuron-specific overexpression of Hus1, mnk, mei-9, mus210, and WRNexo had beneficial effects.

Francisella-arthropod vector interaction and its role in patho-adaptation to infect mammals,21687425,10.3389/fmicb.2011.00034,"Francisella tularensis is a Gram-negative, intracellular, zoonotic bacterium, and is the causative agent of tularemia with a broad host range. Arthropods such as ticks, mosquitoes, and flies maintain F. tularensis in nature by transmitting the bacteria among small mammals. While the tick is largely believed to be a biological vector of F. tularensis, transmission by mosquitoes and flies is largely believed to be mechanical on the mouthpart through interrupted feedings. However, the mechanism of infection of the vectors by F. tularensis is not well understood. Since F. tularensis has not been localized in the salivary gland of the primary human biting ticks, it is thought that bacterial transmission by ticks is through mechanical inoculation of tick feces containing F. tularensis into the skin wound. Drosophila melanogaster is an established good arthropod model for arthropod vectors of tularemia, where F. tularensis infects hemocytes, and is found in hemolymph, as seen in ticks. In addition, phagosome biogenesis and robust intracellular proliferation of F. tularensis in arthropod-derived cells are similar to that in mammalian macrophages. Furthermore, bacterial factors required for infectivity of mammals are often required for infectivity of the fly by F. tularensis. Several host factors that contribute to F. tularensis intracellular pathogenesis in D. melanogaster have been identified, and F. tularensis targets some of the evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic processes to enable intracellular survival and proliferation in evolutionarily distant hosts.",2011,"Christine Akimana, Yousef Abu Kwaik, Christine Akimana, Yousef Abu Kwaik"
Haplotype structure and expression divergence at the Drosophila cellular immune gene eater,20444883,10.1093/molbev/msq114,"The protein Eater plays an important role in microbial recognition and defensive phagocytosis in Drosophila melanogaster. We sequenced multiple alleles of the eater gene from an African and a North American population of D. melanogaster and found signatures of a partial selective sweep in North America that is localized around the second intron. This pattern is consistent with local adaptation to novel selective pressures during range expansion out of Africa. The North American sample is divided into two predominant haplotype groups, and the putatively selected haplotype is associated with a significantly higher gene expression level, suggesting that gene regulation is a possible target of selection. The eater alleles contain from 22 to 40 repeat units that are characterized by the presence of a cysteine-rich NIM motif. NIM repeats in the structural stalk of the protein exhibit concerted evolution as a function of physical location in the repeat array. Several NIM repeats within eater have previously been implicated in binding to microbial ligands, a function which in principle might subject them to special evolutionary pressures.

Transcription through intergenic chromosomal memory elements of the Drosophila bithorax complex correlates with an epigenetic switch,12391168,10.1128/mcb.22.22.8026-8034.2002,"The proteins of the trithorax and Polycomb groups maintain the differential expression pattern of homeotic genes established by the early embryonic patterning system during development. These proteins generate stable and heritable chromatin structures by acting via particular chromosomal memory elements. We established a transgenic assay system showing that the Polycomb group response elements bxd and Mcp confer epigenetic inheritance throughout development. With previously published data for the Fab7 cellular memory module, we confirmed the cellular memory function of Polycomb group response elements. In Drosophila melanogaster, several of these memory elements are located in the large intergenic regulatory regions of the homeotic bithorax complex. Using a transgene assay, we showed that transcription through a memory element correlated with the relief of silencing imposed by the Polycomb group proteins and established an epigenetically heritable active chromatin mode. A memory element remodeled by the process of transcription was able to maintain active expression of a reporter gene throughout development. Thus, transcription appears to reset and change epigenetic marks at chromosomal memory elements regulated by the Polycomb and trithorax proteins. Interestingly, in the bithorax complex of D. melanogaster, the segment-specific expression of noncoding intergenic transcripts during embryogenesis seems to fulfill this switching role for memory elements regulating the homeotic genes.",2002,"Gerhard Rank, Matthias Prestel, Renato Paro, Gerhard Rank, Matthias Prestel, Renato Paro"
Pyrimidine tracts between the 5' splice site and branch point facilitate splicing and recognition of a small Drosophila intron,9111348,10.1128/mcb.17.5.2774,"The minimum size for splicing of a vertebrate intron is approximately 70 nucleotides. In Drosophila melanogaster, more than half of the introns are significantly below this minimum yet function well. Such short introns often lack the pyrimidine tract located between the branch point and 3' splice site common to metazoan introns. To investigate if small introns contain special sequences that facilitate their recognition, the sequences and factors required for the splicing of a 59-nucleotide intron from the D. melanogaster mle gene have been examined. This intron contains only a minimal region of interrupted pyrimidines downstream of the branch point. Instead, two longer, uninterrupted C-rich tracts are located between the 5' splice site and branch point. Both of these sequences are required for maximal in vivo and in vitro splicing. The upstream sequences are also required for maximal binding of factors to the 5' splice site, cross-linking of U2AF to precursor RNA, and assembly of the active spliceosome, suggesting that sequences upstream of the branch point influence events at both ends of the small mle intron.

Evolution of the transposable element mariner in the Drosophila melanogaster species group,1334916,10.1007/BF00133709,"The population biology and molecular evolution of the transposable element mariner has been studied in the eight species of the melanogaster subgroup of the Drosophila subgenus Sophophora. The element occurs in D. simulans, D. mauritiana, D. sechellia, D. teissieri, and D. yakuba, but is not found in D. melanogaster, D. erecta, or D. orena. Sequence comparisons suggest that the mariner element was present in the ancestor of the species subgroup and was lost in some of the lineages. Most species contain both active and inactive mariner elements. A deletion of most of the 3' end characterizes many elements in D. teissieri, but in other species the inactive elements differ from active ones only by simple nucleotide substitutions or small additions/deletions. Active mariner elements from all species are quite similar in nucleotide sequence, although there are some species-specific differences.

[Effects of diethylhexyl phthalate on lipid peroxidation and the life-span in Drosophila melanogaster],15842832,,"Objective:
      
    

    
      To observe the effects of diethlhexyl phthalate (DEHP) on lipid peroxidation and the life span in Drosophila melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Fed Drosophila with the concentration 0.20% DEHP of exposure after 0, 14, 28 days, the activity of total superoxide dismutase (SOD), CuZn-SOD and the concentration of malondialdehyde were determined. At the same time, the longevity test was carried out to examine the effect of DEHP on the Drosophila's lifespan.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The lifespan of Drosophila was shortened in a dose of DEHP exposed groups. The indexes of mean life span (MLS), 50% lethal time and mean maximum life span in three DEHP-treated groups (concentration of 0.05%, 0.10% and 0.20%) were lower than those of the controlled group respectively (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). The MLS of both Drosophila sexes were reduced from the control of 64 days and 59 days to the test 60 days-52 days and 54 days-49 days respectively. DEHP decreased the activity of SOD (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), and lead to a time-dependent relation and an increase in the concentration of malondialdehyde (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) in the DEHP-exposed Drosophila groups.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      DEHP might promote the process of lipid peroxidation and shorten the life span in Drosophila melanogaster. It should be one of the reasons in the senescence of Drosophila.",2005,"Shu-guang Li, Xin Huang, Xin-wen Zhang, Si-hong Xu, Shu-guang Li, Xin Huang, Xin-wen Zhang, Si-hong Xu"

Although mouse models of Gaucher's disease have been reported from several laboratories, these models are limited due to the perinatal lethality of GlcCerase gene. Here, we examined phenotypes of Drosophila melanogaster homologues genes of the human Gaucher's disease gene by using Minos insertion. One of two Minos insertion mutants to unknown function gene (CG31414) accumulates the hydroxy-GlcCer in whole body of Drosophila melanogaster. This mutant showed abnormal phenotypes of climbing ability and sleep, and short lifespan. These abnormal phenotypes are very similar to that of Gaucher's disease in human. In contrast, another Minos insertion mutant (CG31148) and its RNAi line did not show such severe phenotype as observed in CG31414 gene mutation.

Naltrexone Reverses Ethanol Preference and Protein Kinase C Activation in Drosophila melanogaster,29593550,10.3389/fphys.2018.00175,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major health, social and economic problem for which there are few effective treatments. The opiate antagonist naltrexone is currently prescribed clinically with mixed success. We have used naltrexone in an established behavioral assay (CAFE) in Drosophila melanogaster that measures the flies' preference for ethanol-containing food. We have confirmed that Drosophila exposed to ethanol develop a preference toward this drug and we demonstrate that naltrexone, in a dose dependant manner, reverses the ethanol-induced ethanol preference. This effect is not permanent, as preference for alcohol returns after discontinuing naltrexone. Additionally, naltrexone reduced the alcohol-induced increase in protein kinase C activity. These findings are of interest because they confirm that Drosophila is a useful model for studying human responses to addictive drugs. Additionally because of the lack of a closely conserved opiate system in insects, our results could either indicate that a functionally related system does exist in insects or that in insects, and potentially also in mammals, naltrexone binds to alternative sites.

Drosophila melanogaster Zelda and Single-minded collaborate to regulate an evolutionarily dynamic CNS midline cell enhancer,22537497,10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.04.001,"The Drosophila Zelda transcription factor plays an important role in regulating transcription at the embryonic maternal-to-zygotic transition. However, expression of zelda continues throughout embryogenesis in cells including the developing CNS and trachea, but little is known about its post-blastoderm functions. In this paper, it is shown that zelda directly controls CNS midline and tracheal expression of the link (CG13333) gene, as well as link blastoderm expression. The link gene contains a 5' enhancer with multiple Zelda TAGteam binding sites that in vivo mutational studies show are required for link transcription. The link enhancer also has a binding site for the Single-minded:Tango and Trachealess:Tango bHLH-PAS proteins that also influences link midline and tracheal expression. These results provide an example of how a transcription factor (Single-minded or Trachealess) can interact with distinct co-regulatory proteins (Zelda or Sox/POU-homeodomain proteins) to control a similar pattern of expression of different target genes in a mechanistically different manner. While zelda and single-minded midline expression is well-conserved in Drosophila, midline expression of link is not well-conserved. Phylogenetic analysis of link expression suggests that ~60 million years ago, midline expression was nearly or completely absent, and first appeared in the melanogaster group (including D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, and D. erecta) >13 million years ago. The differences in expression are due, in part, to sequence polymorphisms in the link enhancer and likely due to altered binding of multiple transcription factors. Less than 6 million years ago, a second change occurred that resulted in high levels of expression in D. melanogaster. This change may be due to alterations in a putative Zelda binding site. Within the CNS, the zelda gene is alternatively spliced beginning at mid-embryogenesis into transcripts that encode a Zelda isoform missing three zinc fingers from the DNA binding domain. This may result in a protein with altered, possibly non-functional, DNA-binding properties. In summary, Zelda collaborates with bHLH-PAS proteins to directly regulate midline and tracheal expression of an evolutionary dynamic enhancer in the post-blastoderm embryo.",2012,"Joseph C Pearson, Joseph D Watson, Stephen T Crews, Joseph C Pearson, Joseph D Watson, Stephen T Crews"
A toolset to study functions of Cytosolic non-specific dipeptidase 2 (CNDP2) using Drosophila as a model organism,30885138,10.1186/s12863-019-0726-z,"Background:
      
    

    
      Expression of the CNDP2 gene is frequently up- or down-regulated in different types of human cancers. However, how the product of this gene is involved in cell growth and proliferation is poorly understood. Moreover, our knowledge of the functions of the CNDP2 orthologs in well-established model organisms is scarce. In particular, the function of the D. melanogaster ortholog of CNDP2, encoded by the CG17337 gene (hereafter referred to as dCNDP2), is still unknown.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      This study was aimed at developing a set of genetic and molecular tools to study the roles of dCNDP2. We generated a dCNDP2 null mutation (hereafter ∆dCNDP2) using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination (HR) and found that the ∆dCNDP2 mutants are homozygous viable, morphologically normal and fertile. We also generated transgenic fly lines expressing eGFP-tagged and non-tagged dCNDP2 protein, all under the control of the UAS promoter, as well as polyclonal antibodies specific to dCNDP2. Using these tools, we demonstrate that only one of the two predicted dCNDP2 isoforms is expressed throughout the different tissues tested. dCNDP2 was detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and was found to be associated with multiple sites in the salivary gland polytene chromosomes.

      The dCNDP2 gene is not essential for fly viability under standard laboratory conditions.

Life span variations in 128 successive generations of D. melanogaster. I. Evidence that the phenomenon exists and analysis of the variations mode,12735899,10.1016/s0047-6374(03)00006-x,"Survival of Drosophila melanogaster was estimated in 128 successive generations for 5 years. The resultant 116 samples (58 for females and 58 for males) containing series of individual values of life span (LS; 50-90 values in each series) were analyzed. Each of 58 pairs of samples belonged to a definite generation in a continuous succession where every next generation was an offspring of the preceding one. In total, 10180 Drosophila flies (5100 females and 5080 males) were studied. The mean life span (MLS) was found to be considerably heterogeneous in the series of generations: in many pairs of consecutive generations, MLSs significantly differed within two errors of the mean (P<0.05), and the minimum and maximum MLSs in the series differed from each other almost twofold. The use of the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test made it possible to conclusively demonstrate highly significant (P<0.001) differences between LS distributions and their medians in the series of successive generations of D. melanogaster. Highly significant (P<0.0001) positive correlations (from 0.61 to 0.91) between the parameters characterizing the minimum (t(10)), mean, and maximum (t(90)) LSs were found. This indicates considerable consistency of the LS variations in successive generations of the same population, with the proportions of individuals with low and high LSs remaining about the same irrespective of the MLS. It was demonstrated with the use of mathematical simulation that the MLS changes in successive generations may be regarded as an oscillatory process and described as a sum of several (three to five) harmonic components. The calculated determination coefficients were high (93.51 and 88.93% for females and males, respectively). This indicates that the mathematical model used for simulation adequately described the observed variations in MLS.

Double-stranded RNA-mediated silencing of genomic tandem repeats and transposable elements in the D. melanogaster germline,11470406,10.1016/s0960-9822(01)00299-8,"Background:
      
    

    
      The injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) has been shown to induce a potent sequence-specific inhibition of gene function in diverse invertebrate and vertebrate species. The homology-dependent posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) caused by the introduction of transgenes in plants may be mediated by dsRNA. The analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans mutants impaired with dsRNA-mediated silencing and studies in plants implicate a biological role of dsRNA-mediated silencing as a transposon-repression and antiviral mechanism.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We investigated the silencing of testis-expressed Stellate genes by paralogous Su(Ste) tandem repeats, which are known to be involved in the maintenance of male fertility in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that both strands of repressor Su(Ste) repeats are transcribed, producing sense and antisense RNA. The Stellate silencing is associated with the presence of short Su(Ste) RNAs. Cotransfection experiments revealed that Su(Ste) dsRNA can target and eliminate Stellate transcripts in Drosophila cell culture. The short fragment of Stellate gene that is homologous to Su(Ste) was shown to be sufficient to confer Su(Ste)-dependent silencing of a reporter construct in testes. We demonstrated that Su(Ste) dsRNA-mediated silencing affects not only Stellate expression but also the level of sense Su(Ste) RNA providing a negative autogenous regulation of Su(Ste) expression. Mutation in the spindle-E gene relieving Stellate silencing also leads to a derepression of the other genomic tandem repeats and retrotransposons in the germline.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Homology-dependent gene silencing was shown to be used to inhibit Stellate gene expression in the D. melanogaster germline, ensuring male fertility. dsRNA-mediated silencing may provide a basis for negative autogenous control of gene expression.

Virus Innexins induce alterations in insect cell and tissue function,28077262,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.01.003,"Polydnaviruses are dsDNA viruses that induce immune and developmental alterations in their caterpillar hosts. Characterization of polydnavirus gene families and family members is necessary to understand mechanisms of pathology and evolution of these viruses, and may aid to elucidate the role of host homologues if present. For example, the polydnavirus vinnexin gene family encodes homologues of insect gap junction genes (innexins) that are expressed in host immune cells (hemocytes). While the roles of Innexin proteins and gap junctions in insect immunity are largely unclear, we previously demonstrated that Vinnexins form functional gap junctions and alter the junctional characteristics of a host Innexin when co-expressed in paired Xenopus oocytes. Here, we test the effect of ectopic vinnexin expression on host cell physiology using both a lepidopteran cell culture model and a dipteran whole organism model. Vinnexin expression in the cell culture system resulted in gene-specific alterations in cell morphology and a slight, but non-statistically significant, reduction in gap junction activity as measured by dye transfer, while ectopic expression of a lepidopteran innexin2 gene led to morphological alterations and increase in gap junction activity. Global ectopic expression in the model dipteran, Drosophila melanogaster, of one vinnexin (vinnexinG) or D. melanogaster innexin2 (Dm-inx2) resulted in embryonic lethality, while expression of the other vinnexin genes had no effect. Furthermore, ectopic expression of vinnexinG, but not other vinnexin genes or Dm-inx2, in D. melanogaster larval gut resulted in developmental arrest in the pupal stage. These data indicate the vinnexins likely have gene-specific roles in host manipulation. They also support the use of Drosophila in further analysis of the role of Vinnexins and other polydnavirus genes in modifying host physiological processes. Finally, our findings suggest the vinnexin genes may be useful to perturb and characterize the physiological functions of insect Innexins.",2017,"Daniel K Hasegawa, Stephanie L Erickson, Bradley M Hersh, Matthew W Turnbull, Daniel K Hasegawa, Stephanie L Erickson, Bradley M Hersh, Matthew W Turnbull"
"Molecular population genetics of ref(2)P, a locus which confers viral resistance in Drosophila",8583891,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025555,"The ref(2)P locus (2-54.2) is polymorphic for two allelic forms in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster, ref(2)Po and ref(2)Pp. The latter allele confers resistance to the rhabdovirus sigma infecting wild populations. Previous work, based on a small sample of prescreened restrictive (resistant) and permissive (susceptible) alleles, identified a large number of amino acid replacement changes (7) relative to synonymous changes (1). Such protein variability could be the result of variation-enhancing selection. To further test the selection hypothesis, we have examined the DNA sequences of ten randomly chosen lines of D. melanogaster and one line of D. simulans. Nine of the ten lines are permissive; D. simulans does not harbor the virus. The melanogaster alleles contain 4 synonymous changes, 19 noncoding changes, and 13 amino acid replacement changes, indicating a relatively high level of polymorphism. Three sequenced restrictive alleles have nearly identical sequences, indicating that they are relatively young. Compared to the permissive alleles, they share only a complex deletion at codon 34, CAG-AAT to GGA, which our analysis indicates to be the site conferring the restrictive phenotype. Patterns of polymorphism and divergence differ from neutral predictions by several criteria for the amino terminal region, which contains the complex deletion (codons 1-91), but not the remainder of the protein (codons 92-599). We find a higher rate of evolution on the D. melanogaster lineage than on the D. simulans lineage. The relatively large amount of both replacement and silent polymorphism in the permissive alleles and the lack of divergence between permissive and restrictive alleles suggests that the sigma virus and ref(2)P may be engaged in an evolutionary race in which new restrictive alleles are continually arising but are relatively short-lived.",1996,"M L Wayne, D Contamine, M Kreitman, M L Wayne, D Contamine, M Kreitman"

The coding region of the sPLA2 gene was interrupted by a short intron, and codes for a signal peptide of 18 amino acids, followed by a mature protein of 168 amino acids, containing the structural features of group III sPLA2. From a Northern blot analysis, about a 1.0-kb Drosophila sPLA2 transcript was found to be expressed throughout its development and in both the adult bodies and heads. The recombinant Drosophila sPLA2 expressed and purified in Escherichia coli was found to be Ca(+2)-dependent and maximally active at pH 5.",2003,"Yoonseok Ryu, Younsang Oh, Jaeseung Yoon, Wonhwa Cho, Kwanghee Baek, Yoonseok Ryu, Younsang Oh, Jaeseung Yoon, Wonhwa Cho, Kwanghee Baek"

Sumoylation of Drosophila transcription factor STAT92E,20616536,10.1159/000318676,"STAT92E is an essential transcription factor in Drosophila melanogaster for the development of several organs and the immune system. The JAK/STAT pathway employs different evolutionary conserved regulatory mechanisms to control biological processes. Numerous transcription factors in both mammals and invertebrates have been shown to be either activated or inhibited by a covalent modification with a small ubiquitin-like modifier (Sumo). Here, we show that Drosophila STAT92E is modified by Sumo at a single lysine residue 187 in S2 cells. Mutation of Lys187 increases the transcriptional activity of STAT92E, thus suggesting that sumoylation of STAT92E has a repressive role in the regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway in Drosophila melanogaster.",2010,"Juha Grönholm, Daniela Ungureanu, Sari Vanhatupa, Mika Rämet, Olli Silvennoinen, Juha Grönholm, Daniela Ungureanu, Sari Vanhatupa, Mika Rämet, Olli Silvennoinen"
Maintenance of the Drosophila melanogaster genomic fragment harbouring the mdg4 copia-like retrotransposon in tobacco cells,2455663,,"Recent experiments have revealed that plant genomes contain genetic elements closely related to well-known yeast and Drosophila retrotransposons. In connection with these findings we decided to test the behaviour of one of the well-defined Drosophila retrotransposons in tobacco cells. The copia-like Drosophila melanogaster retrotransposon mdg4 was introduced into Nicotiana tabacum and Nicotiana plumbaginifolia cells using a Ti plasmid vector. The results showed that entire copies of mdg4, as part of pTiC58 T-DNA, were stably maintained in tobacco cells upon continuous culturing of transformed tumour lines on hormone-free medium. Transcription of mdg4 from its LTR promoter was not detectable in tobacco cells.",1988,"B Brzobohatý, L Karlovská, B Vyskot, M Bezdĕk, B Brzobohatý, L Karlovská, B Vyskot, M Bezdĕk"

Obesity-associated cardiac dysfunction in starvation-selected Drosophila melanogaster,26136533,10.1152/ajpregu.00160.2015,"There is a clear link between obesity and cardiovascular disease, but the complexity of this interaction in mammals makes it difficult to study. Among the animal models used to investigate obesity-associated diseases, Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as an important platform of discovery. In the laboratory, Drosophila can be made obese through lipogenic diets, genetic manipulations, and adaptation to evolutionary stress. While dietary and genetic changes that cause obesity in flies have been demonstrated to induce heart dysfunction, there have been no reports investigating how obesity affects the heart in laboratory-evolved populations. Here, we studied replicated populations of Drosophila that had been selected for starvation resistance for over 65 generations. These populations evolved characteristics that closely resemble hallmarks of metabolic syndrome in mammals. We demonstrate that starvation-selected Drosophila have dilated hearts with impaired contractility. This phenotype appears to be correlated with large fat deposits along the dorsal cuticle, which alter the anatomical position of the heart. We demonstrate a strong relationship between fat storage and heart dysfunction, as dilation and reduced contractility can be rescued through prolonged fasting. Unlike other Drosophila obesity models, the starvation-selected lines do not exhibit excessive intracellular lipid deposition within the myocardium and rather store excess triglycerides in large lipid droplets within the fat body. Our findings provide a new model to investigate obesity-associated heart dysfunction.",2015,"Christopher M Hardy, Ryan T Birse, Matthew J Wolf, Lin Yu, Rolf Bodmer, Allen G Gibbs, Christopher M Hardy, Ryan T Birse, Matthew J Wolf, Lin Yu, Rolf Bodmer, Allen G Gibbs"

OnTheFly: a database of Drosophila melanogaster transcription factors and their binding sites,24271386,10.1093/nar/gkt1165,"We present OnTheFly (http://bhapp.c2b2.columbia.edu/OnTheFly/index.php), a database comprising a systematic collection of transcription factors (TFs) of Drosophila melanogaster and their DNA-binding sites. TFs predicted in the Drosophila melanogaster genome are annotated and classified and their structures, obtained via experiment or homology models, are provided. All known preferred TF DNA-binding sites obtained from the B1H, DNase I and SELEX methodologies are presented. DNA shape parameters predicted for these sites are obtained from a high throughput server or from crystal structures of protein-DNA complexes where available. An important feature of the database is that all DNA-binding domains and their binding sites are fully annotated in a eukaryote using structural criteria and evolutionary homology. OnTheFly thus provides a comprehensive view of TFs and their binding sites that will be a valuable resource for deciphering non-coding regulatory DNA.",2014,"Shula Shazman, Hunjoong Lee, Yakov Socol, Richard S Mann, Barry Honig, Shula Shazman, Hunjoong Lee, Yakov Socol, Richard S Mann, Barry Honig"
A mild stress due to hypergravity exposure at young age increases longevity in Drosophila melanogaster males,11707930,10.1023/a:1010043914016,"Drosophila melanogaster flies were exposed to hypergravity starting at two days of age, the range of gravity levels used being 2.58-7.38 g. No longevity change was observed for exposures of less than 14 days. The longevity of males increased if they were submitted to hypergravity for durations ranging from 14 to 24 days. This increase in longevity was never observed in females. The positive effect of exposure to hypergravity has been replicated in two laboratories using two wild-type strains and different rearing conditions. A short hypergravity exposure seems to be a mild stress, yielding positive effects on longevity. This is in accordance with two previous studies showing a slight longevity increase after heat shock in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and in Drosophila melanogaster.",2000,"E Le Bourg, N Minois, P Bullens, P Baret, E Le Bourg, N Minois, P Bullens, P Baret"
Enhancing our understanding of the molecular responses to hypoxia in mammals using Drosophila melanogaster,10749845,10.1152/jappl.2000.88.4.1481,"Drosophila melanogaster has been used as a genetic model, especially in the past decade, to examine normative biological processes and disease conditions very effectively. These span a wide range of major issues such as aging, cancer, embryogenesis, neural development, apoptosis, and alcohol intoxication. Here, we detail how the Drosophila melanogaster can be used as a genetic model to study the molecular and genetic underpinnings of the response to hypoxia. In our study of the basis of anoxia tolerance, one of the potent approaches that we use is a mutagenesis screen to identify loss-of-function mutants that are anoxia sensitive. The major advantage of this approach is that it is not biased for any particular gene or gene product. Although our screen is in progress, we already have evidence that this approach is useful.",2000,"G G Haddad, G G Haddad"
ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FEEDING RATE AND PARASITOID RESISTANCE IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,28565507,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1999.tb04544.x,"Replicate lines of Drosophila melanogaster have been selected for increased resistance against one of two species of parasitoid wasp, Asobara tabida and Leptopilina boulardi. In both cases, it has been shown that an improved ability to mount an immunological defense against the parasitoid's egg is associated with reduced survival when the larvae are reared under conditions of low resource availability and thus high competition. We show here that in both sets of selected lines, lower competitive ability is associated with reduced rates of larval feeding, as measured by the frequency of retractions of the cephalopharyngeal skeleton. This suggests that the same or similar physiological processes are involved in the trade-off between competition and resistance against either parasitoid and shows how the interaction between adaptations for competition and natural enemy resistance may be mediated.",1999,"M D E Fellowes, A R Kraaijeveld, H C J Godfray, M D E Fellowes, A R Kraaijeveld, H C J Godfray"

This CRM was analysed throughout development and showed an equivalent pattern to that reported for PAH activity in this insect, with maxima at pupariation and at pharate adult formation. Distribution of this CRM in larval tissues, the haemolymph and the adult body is mainly restricted to the larval fat body and the adult head. Demonstration of this CRM as the PAH protein comes from the correlation between the decreased PAH enzyme activities of two mutant strains and their decreased amounts of CRM by Western blotting.",1992,"F J Silva, Y Bel, L M Botella, R G Cotton, J Ferré, F J Silva, Y Bel, L M Botella, R G Cotton, J Ferré"

Parallel ionoregulatory adjustments underlie phenotypic plasticity and evolution of Drosophila cold tolerance,25524989,10.1242/jeb.115790,"Low temperature tolerance is the main predictor of variation in the global distribution and performance of insects, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying cold tolerance variation are poorly known, and it is unclear whether the mechanisms that improve cold tolerance within the lifetime of an individual insect are similar to those that underlie evolved differences among species. The accumulation of cold-induced injuries by hemimetabolous insects is associated with loss of Na(+) and K(+) homeostasis. Here we show that this model holds true for Drosophila; cold exposure increases haemolymph [K(+)] in D. melanogaster, and cold-acclimated flies maintain low haemolymph [Na(+)] and [K(+)], both at rest and during a cold exposure. This pattern holds across 24 species of the Drosophila phylogeny, where improvements in cold tolerance have been consistently paired with reductions in haemolymph [Na(+)] and [K(+)]. Cold-acclimated D. melanogaster have low activity of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, which may contribute to the maintenance of low haemolymph [Na(+)] and underlie improvements in cold tolerance. Modifications to ion balance are associated with both phenotypic plasticity within D. melanogaster and evolutionary differences in cold tolerance across the Drosophila phylogeny, which suggests that adaptation and acclimation of cold tolerance in insects may occur through similar mechanisms. Cold-tolerant flies maintain haemolymph osmolality despite low haemolymph [Na(+)] and [K(+)], possibly through modest accumulations of organic osmolytes. We propose that this could have served as an evolutionary route by which chill-susceptible insects developed more extreme cold tolerance strategies.",2015,"Heath A MacMillan, Laura V Ferguson, Annegret Nicolai, Andrew Donini, James F Staples, Brent J Sinclair, Heath A MacMillan, Laura V Ferguson, Annegret Nicolai, Andrew Donini, James F Staples, Brent J Sinclair"
Microtubule plus-ends act as physical signaling hubs to activate RhoA during cytokinesis,30758285,10.7554/eLife.38968,"Microtubules (MTs) are essential for cleavage furrow positioning during cytokinesis, but the mechanisms by which MT-derived signals spatially define regions of cortical contractility are unresolved. In this study cytokinesis regulators visualized in Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) cells were found to localize to and track MT plus-ends during cytokinesis. The RhoA GEF Pebble (Dm ECT2) did not evidently tip-track, but rather localized rapidly to cortical sites contacted by MT plus-tips, resulting in RhoA activation and enrichment of myosin-regulatory light chain. The MT plus-end localization of centralspindlin was compromised following EB1 depletion, which resulted in a higher incidence of cytokinesis failure. Centralspindlin plus-tip localization depended on the C-terminus and a putative EB1-interaction motif (hxxPTxh) in RacGAP50C. We propose that MT plus-end-associated centralspindlin recruits a cortical pool of Dm ECT2 upon physical contact to activate RhoA and to trigger localized contractility.",2019,"Vikash Verma, Thomas J Maresca, Vikash Verma, Thomas J Maresca"
"Can maternally inherited endosymbionts adapt to a novel host? Direct costs of Spiroplasma infection, but not vertical transmission efficiency, evolve rapidly after horizontal transfer into D. melanogaster",25649504,10.1038/hdy.2014.112,"Maternally inherited symbionts are common in arthropods and many have important roles in host adaptation. The observation that specific symbiont lineages infect distantly related host species implies new interactions are commonly established by lateral transfer events. However, studies have shown that symbionts often perform poorly in novel hosts. We hypothesized selection on the symbiont may be sufficiently rapid that poor performance in a novel host environment is rapidly ameliorated, permitting symbiont maintenance. Here, we test this prediction for a Spiroplasma strain transinfected into the novel host Drosophila melanogaster. In the generations immediately following transinfection, the symbiont had low transmission efficiency to offspring and imposed severe fitness costs on its host. We observed that effects on host fitness evolved rapidly, being undetectable after 17 generations in the novel host, whereas vertical transmission efficiency was poorly responsive over this period. Our results suggest that long-term symbiosis may more readily be established in cases where symbionts perform poorly in just one aspect of symbiosis.",2015,"S Nakayama, S R Parratt, K J Hutchence, Z Lewis, T A R Price, G D D Hurst, S Nakayama, S R Parratt, K J Hutchence, Z Lewis, T A R Price, G D D Hurst"
Transcriptional regulation of the purine de novo synthesis gene Prat in Drosophila melanogaster,23357222,10.1016/j.gene.2013.01.024,"The first step of the purine de novo synthesis pathway is catalyzed by amidophosphoribosyltransferase (E.C.2.4.2.14) which is encoded by two Prat genes in D. melanogaster, Prat and Prat2. Prat is a retrogene duplication of Prat2, where each gene has a distinct expression pattern. Prat transcription is restricted to proliferating tissues such as imaginal discs and the female germ line. Three conserved putative DNA replication-related element binding factor (DREF) sites lie upstream of the Prat coding region. These elements are upstream of many genes important in cell proliferation. We have found that DREF binds directly upstream of Prat and that the DRE sites associated with its activity are necessary for Prat expression; furthermore, we have determined that a second cis-acting element is present upstream of the Prat gene. Finally, the genes Distal-less, Mi-2 and dMyc, which influence Dref activity, do not appear to affect Prat transcription.",2013,"Eric Merzetti, Joanne M Hackett, Denise V Clark, Eric Merzetti, Joanne M Hackett, Denise V Clark"
Plasticity in the effects of sulfated and nonsulfated sulfakinin on heart contractions,19273332,10.2741/3510,"Neuropeptides regulate the frequency of heart contractions. Drosophila melanogaster sulfakinin (drosulfakinin) encodes FDDYGHMRFamide, DSK I, and GGDDQFDDYGHMRFamide, DSK II. Invertebrate sulfakinins are structurally and functionally related to vertebrate cholecystokinins. Naturally-occurring drosulfakinins contain a sulfated or nonsulfated tyrosine and are designated sDSK I, sDSK II, nsDSK I, and nsDSK II. We developed a novel neural-cardiovascular preparation and investigated mechanisms regulating the effect of sulfakinins on D. melanogaster heart. We established the preparation in larva, pupa, and adult to examine plasticity in neural regulation of cardiovascular parameters. We discovered sDSK I increased the frequency of larval, pupal, and adult heart contractions; nsDSK I only increased the frequency of larval contractions, not pupal or adult. We also discovered sDSK II and nsDSK II increased the frequency of larval and adult contractions, not pupal. This is the first report of nonsulfated sulfakinin activity on heart, and sulfakinin activity examined in 3 developmental stages within the same animal species. Our data demonstrate a role for plasticity in the effects of sulfakinins on heart contractions, and suggest multiple mechanisms are involved.",2009,"Ruthann Nichols, Beth Manoogian, Emilie Walling, Melissa Mispelon, Ruthann Nichols, Beth Manoogian, Emilie Walling, Melissa Mispelon"
The hormetic effects of hypergravity on longevity and aging,18648640,10.2203/dose-response.05-008.Minois,"This paper reviews the literature on the effects of hypergravity (HG, gravity levels higher than 1g, the terrestrial gravity) on longevity and aging. The different studies showed that life-long exposures to high gravity levels decreased longevity and accelerated the age-related decline observed on some physiological and behavioral variables. In contrast, chronic exposure to HG increased resistance to heat in young and middle-aged Drosophila melanogaster. A short exposure to HG at the beginning of adult life increased male longevity and delayed behavioral aging in D. melanogaster. All these results show that HG acts as a hormetic factor. Long exposures to HG have deleterious effects on longevity and aging, whereas short exposures have beneficial effects. Some potential mechanisms of action of the beneficial effects of HG are also reviewed here. However, the ones tested so far (heat shock proteins and antioxidant defense) have proven unable to explain the hormetic effects of HG and their mechanisms of action are still unknown.",2006,"Nadège Minois, Nadège Minois"
Evidence for an epigenetic mechanism by which Hsp90 acts as a capacitor for morphological evolution,12483213,10.1038/ng1067,"Morphological alterations have been shown to occur in Drosophila melanogaster when function of Hsp90 (heat shock 90-kDa protein 1alpha, encoded by Hsp83) is compromised during development. Genetic selection maintains the altered phenotypes in subsequent generations. Recent experiments have shown, however, that phenotypic variation still occurs in nearly isogenic recombinant inbred strains of Arabidopsis thaliana. Using a sensitized isogenic D. melanogaster strain, iso-Kr(If-1), we confirm this finding and present evidence supporting an epigenetic mechanism for Hsp90's capacitor function, whereby reduced activity of Hsp90 induces a heritably altered chromatin state. The altered chromatin state is evidenced by ectopic expression of the morphogen wingless in eye imaginal discs and a corresponding abnormal eye phenotype, both of which are epigenetically heritable in subsequent generations, even when function of Hsp90 is restored. Mutations in nine different genes of the trithorax group that encode chromatin-remodeling proteins also induce the abnormal phenotype. These findings suggest that Hsp90 acts as a capacitor for morphological evolution through epigenetic and genetic mechanisms.",2003,"Vincent Sollars, Xiangyi Lu, Li Xiao, Xiaoyan Wang, Mark D Garfinkel, Douglas M Ruden, Vincent Sollars, Xiangyi Lu, Li Xiao, Xiaoyan Wang, Mark D Garfinkel, Douglas M Ruden"

Transcripts are present at all stages of the life cycle. In situ hybridization to mRNA in tissue sections of third instar larvae showed that transcripts were restricted to the mid-gut. One gene was sequenced. The translated amino acid sequence of the proposed active enzyme is 42% homologous to bovine trypsin. Regions of functional importance are more strongly conserved. These include the active site residues asp102, his57, ser195, and the residue asp189 which is reputed to bind the basic residue at the substrate cleavage site. The activation peptide is not homologous to that of most vertebrate trypsins, suggesting a modified activation mechanism.

Survival of homozygous mutant flies is significantly reduced on medium containing sodium n-butyrate. The butyrate sensitive suppressor mutations are further characterized by recessive female sterility and reduced survival of homozygotes. Complementation analysis showed their allelism. The locus of these mutations, Su-var (2) 1, has been localized to 40.5 +/- 0.2 and, by using interstitial duplications, to region 31CD on the cytogenetic map. Moreover, the mutant alleles of the Su-var (2) 1 locus display a lethal interaction with the heterochromatic Y chromosome. The presence or absence of a Y chromosome in males or females has a strong influence on the viability of homozygous or transheterozygous suppressor flies.

An electrophoretically cryptic alcohol dehydrogenase variant in Drosophila melanogaster. III. Biochemical properties and comparison with common enzyme forms,6803751,10.1071/bi9810625,"The biochemical properties of the heat-stable alcohol dehydrogenase variant ADH-FCh.D. have been investigated and compared with those of the two common enzyme forms ADH-F and ADH-S.

In all these tests the enzyme ADH-FCh.D. resembles ADH-S much more closely than ADH-F. It is concluded that if natural selection is to distinguish between the alleles AdhS and AdhFCh.D. then it most probably does so on the basis of the superior thermostability of ADH-FCh.D.

The present study tested whether feeding flies with frozen yeast rather than with fresh yeast could have some effect on these traits, the other components of the food being similar in the two groups. Freezing altered live yeast quality and flies feeding on frozen yeast lived slightly less (males), were less fecund at older ages, and poorly resisted to some severe stresses (cold and starvation), no negative effect being observed on resistance to heat.

Sepia eye colour mutation decreases sexual activity of Drosophila melanogaster males, influences the preference ability of females and decreases the number of progeny from homogamic mating of the se x se type, as well as from heterogamic copulations in which sepia females take part. Non-random mating of wild type males and sepia females (in ""multiple-choice"" situation), with genetically and phenotypically different individuals, could be another mechanism for conservation of genetic polymorphism in natural populations.",2005,"Snezana Stanić, Sofija Pavković-Lucic, Snezana Stanić, Sofija Pavković-Lucic"
The use of genetic complementation in the study of eukaryotic macromolecular evolution: rate of spontaneous gene duplication at two loci of Drosophila melanogaster,3091844,10.1007/BF02099910,"Gene duplications must play an important role in the evolutionary development of living organisms. Presented here is a general scheme that uses complementary alleles to isolate gene duplications in diploid organisms. The technique was used in Drosophila melanogaster to assess the rate of spontaneous gene duplication at two loci, maroon-like and rosy. The results indicate that the rate of duplication of the maroon-like locus is on the order of 2.7 X 10(-6); that the rate of duplication of the rosy locus is approximately 1.7 X 10(-4); and that duplication occurs in males, suggesting that there may actually be two modes of gene duplication in Drosophila melanogaster.",1986,"S K Shapira, V G Finnerty, S K Shapira, V G Finnerty"
Structural analysis of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from several Drosophila species,4084218,10.1007/BF02399410,"This report describes preliminary protein structural studies of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-GPDH) from Drosophila spp. and an important innovative feature of our enzyme purification protocol. The scheme involves the coupling of substrate (alpha-glycerophosphate) elution from CM-Sephadex and cofactor (NADH) elution from Affi-Gel blue resin. Using this method a 32.7% yield and a 111-fold purification were obtained from a D. melanogaster line carrying the alpha-GpdhS allele at the alpha-Gpdh locus. The product obtained from 0 to 3-day-old adult flies was electrophoretically homogeneous and consisted mainly of the adult alpha-GPDH-1 isozyme. The method was used to obtain alpha-GPDH protein from D. melanogaster (two lines), D. hydei, D. immigrans, and D. mercatorum. Peptide mapping revealed structural differences among the enzymes from the different species, and amino acid sequencing showed many similarities between D. melanogaster alpha-GPDH and the rabbit muscle enzyme.",1985,"G K Chambers, A A Felton, J A Ramshaw, D L Rigby, D T Sullivan, G K Chambers, A A Felton, J A Ramshaw, D L Rigby, D T Sullivan"
Searching for relief: Drosophila melanogaster navigation in a virtual bitter maze,32361039,10.1016/j.bbr.2020.112616,"Animals use relief-based place learning to pinpoint a specific location where noxious stimuli are diminished or abolished. Here we show how the optogenetically-induced activation of bitter-sensing neurons in Drosophila melanogaster elicits pain-like behavioural responses and stimulates the search for a place where this activation is relieved. Under this ""virtual"" stimulation paradigm it would be feasible to test relief learning several times throughout an animal's lifespan, without the potentially damaging effects which may result from the repeated administration of ""real"" heat or electrical shock. Furthermore, virtual bitter taste could be used in place of virtual pain stimulation to guide conditioned place preference and study learning processes. We also propose that spatially-specific reduction of locomotor velocity may provide immediate evidence of relief-based place learning and spatial memory.",2020,"Nicola Meda, Giovanni Frighetto, Aram Megighian, Mauro Agostino Zordan, Nicola Meda, Giovanni Frighetto, Aram Megighian, Mauro Agostino Zordan"
The adaptive significance of chromosomal inversion polymorphisms in Drosophila melanogaster,30230076,10.1111/mec.14871,"Chromosomal inversions, structural mutations that reverse a segment of a chromosome, cause suppression of recombination in the heterozygous state. Several studies have shown that inversion polymorphisms can form clines or fluctuate predictably in frequency over seasonal time spans. These observations prompted the hypothesis that chromosomal rearrangements might be subject to spatially and/or temporally varying selection. Here, we review what has been learned about the adaptive significance of inversion polymorphisms in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster, the species in which they were first discovered by Sturtevant in 1917. A large body of work provides compelling evidence that several inversions in this system are adaptive; however, the precise selective mechanisms that maintain them polymorphic in natural populations remain poorly understood. Recent advances in population genomics, modelling and functional genetics promise to greatly improve our understanding of this long-standing and fundamental problem in the near future.",2019,"Martin Kapun, Thomas Flatt, Martin Kapun, Thomas Flatt"

Evaluation of the steric impact of flavin adenine dinucleotide in Drosophila melanogaster cryptochrome function,25026553,10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.07.038,"Photoreceptors are crucial components for circadian rhythm entrainment in animals, plants, fungi and cyanobacteria. Cryptochromes (CRYs) are flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) containing photoreceptors, and FAD is responsible for signal transduction, in contrast to photolyases where it promotes DNA-damage repair. In this work, we investigated an alternative role for FAD in CRY. We analyzed the Drosophila melanogaster CRY crystal structure by means of molecular dynamics, elucidating how this large co-factor within the receptor could be crucial for CRY structural stability. The co-factor appears indeed to improve receptor motility, providing steric hindrance. Moreover, multiple sequence alignments revealed that conserved motifs in the C-terminal tail could be necessary for functional stability.",2014,"Alessandro Masiero, Simona Aufiero, Giovanni Minervini, Stefano Moro, Rodolfo Costa, Silvio C E Tosatto, Alessandro Masiero, Simona Aufiero, Giovanni Minervini, Stefano Moro, Rodolfo Costa, Silvio C E Tosatto"

Expression in developing immune, neural, and muscle tissues",11809773,10.1074/jbc.M112105200,"We have cloned and characterized the first galectin to be identified in Drosophila melanogaster. The amino acid sequence of Drosophila galectin showed striking sequence similarity to invertebrate and vertebrate galectins and contained amino acids that are crucial for binding beta-galactoside sugars. Confirming its identity as a galectin family member, the Drosophila galectin bound beta-galactoside sugars. Structurally, the Drosophila galectin was a tandem repeat galectin containing two carbohydrate recognition domains connected by a unique peptide link. This divalent structure suggests that like mammalian galectins, Drosophila galectin may mediate cell-cell communication or facilitate cross-linking of receptors to trigger signal transduction events. The Drosophila galectin was very abundant in embryonic, larval, and adult Drosophila. During embryogenesis, Drosophila galectin had a unique and specific tissue distribution. Drosophila galectin expression was concentrated in somatic and visceral musculature and in the central nervous system. Similar to other insect lectins, Drosophila galectin may function in both embryogenesis and in host defense. Drosophila galectin was expressed by hemocytes, circulating phagocytic cells, suggesting a role for Drosophila galectin in the innate immune system.",2002,"Karen E Pace, Tim Lebestky, Thomas Hummel, Pascal Arnoux, Kent Kwan, Linda G Baum, Karen E Pace, Tim Lebestky, Thomas Hummel, Pascal Arnoux, Kent Kwan, Linda G Baum"

Behavioral Teratogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,29896698,10.1007/978-1-4939-7883-0_14,"Developmental biology is a fascinating branch of science which helps us to understand the mechanism of development, thus the findings are used in various therapeutic approach. Drosophila melanogaster served as a model to find the key molecules that initiate and regulate the mechanism of development. Various genes, transcription factors, and signaling pathways helping in development are identified in Drosophila. Many toxic compounds, which can affect the development, are also recognized using Drosophila model. These compounds, which can affect the development, are named as a teratogen. Many teratogens identified using Drosophila may also act as a teratogen for a human being since 75% of conservation exist between the disease genes present in Drosophila and human. There are certain teratogens, which do not cause developmental defect if exposed during pregnancy, however; behavioral defect appears in later part of development. Such compounds are named as a behavioral teratogen. Thus, it is worthy to identify the potential behavioral teratogen using Drosophila model. Drosophila behavior is well studied in various developmental stages. This chapter describes various methods which can be employed to test behavioral teratogenesis in Drosophila.",2018,"Monalisa Mishra, Bedanta Kumar Barik, Monalisa Mishra, Bedanta Kumar Barik"
Drosophila C virus cycle during the development of two Drosophila melanogaster strains (Charolles and Champetières) after larval contamination by food,1300196,10.1016/0248-4900(92)90207-h,"Drosophila C virus (DCV) cycle during Drosophila melanogaster development was studied after feeding contamination at the first, most sensitive, instar (L1). Two Drosophila strains were examined and compared. Presence of DCVC in apparently healthy animals (L3 larvae bred on a contaminated rearing medium and adults coming from larvae which were grown on medium containing DCVC) was demonstrated by biological tests. Using the immunofluorescence technique, DCV was exhibited in the diseased Charolles larvae, in the lumen of the digestive tract and in the basal part of gut cells which is in contact with the haemolymph. On the contrary, in Charolles larvae which seemed 'healthy', DCV was exhibited only in the lumen of the digestive tract at the apical boundary of the gut cells. But DCV typical protein capsid was not shown in the tissues of Drosophila L3 and adults. However, C virus remained in Drosophila tissues even after host metamorphosis and would seem to interact with Drosophila cells. Hypotheses are proposed concerning the intracellular state of Drosophila C virus in this case.",1992,"N Lautié-Harivel, N Lautié-Harivel"
Nuclear microenvironments modulate transcription from low-affinity enhancers,29095143,10.7554/eLife.28975,"Transcription factors bind low-affinity DNA sequences for only short durations. It is not clear how brief, low-affinity interactions can drive efficient transcription. Here, we report that the transcription factor Ultrabithorax (Ubx) utilizes low-affinity binding sites in the Drosophila melanogaster shavenbaby (svb) locus and related enhancers in nuclear microenvironments of high Ubx concentrations. Related enhancers colocalize to the same microenvironments independently of their chromosomal location, suggesting that microenvironments are highly differentiated transcription domains. Manipulating the affinity of svb enhancers revealed an inverse relationship between enhancer affinity and Ubx concentration required for transcriptional activation. The Ubx cofactor, Homothorax (Hth), was co-enriched with Ubx near enhancers that require Hth, even though Ubx and Hth did not co-localize throughout the nucleus. Thus, microenvironments of high local transcription factor and cofactor concentrations could help low-affinity sites overcome their kinetic inefficiency. Mechanisms that generate these microenvironments could be a general feature of eukaryotic transcriptional regulation.",2017,"Albert Tsai, Anand K Muthusamy, Mariana Rp Alves, Luke D Lavis, Robert H Singer, David L Stern, Justin Crocker, Albert Tsai, Anand K Muthusamy, Mariana Rp Alves, Luke D Lavis, Robert H Singer, David L Stern, Justin Crocker"
Introduction of a male-harming mitochondrial haplotype via 'Trojan Females' achieves population suppression in fruit flies,28467301,10.7554/eLife.23551,"Pests are a global threat to biodiversity, ecosystem function, and human health. Pest control approaches are thus numerous, but their implementation costly, damaging to non-target species, and ineffective at low population densities. The Trojan Female Technique (TFT) is a prospective self-perpetuating control technique that is species-specific and predicted to be effective at low densities. The goal of the TFT is to harness naturally occurring mutations in the mitochondrial genome that impair male fertility while having no effect on females. Here, we provide proof-of-concept for the TFT, by showing that introduction of a male fertility-impairing mtDNA haplotype into replicated populations of Drosophila melanogaster causes numerical population suppression, with the magnitude of effect positively correlated with its frequency at trial inception. Further development of the TFT could lead to establishing a control strategy that overcomes limitations of conventional approaches, with broad applicability to invertebrate and vertebrate species, to control environmental and economic pests.",2017,"Jonci Nikolai Wolff, Neil J Gemmell, Daniel M Tompkins, Damian K Dowling, Jonci Nikolai Wolff, Neil J Gemmell, Daniel M Tompkins, Damian K Dowling"
"Effects of Essential Oil from Hinoki Cypress, Chamaecyparis obtusa, on Physiology and Behavior of Flies",26624577,10.1371/journal.pone.0143450,"Phytoncides, which are volatile substances emitted from plants for protection against plant pathogens and insects, are known to have insecticidal, antimicrobial, and antifungal activities. In contrast to their negative effects on microorganisms and insects, phytoncides have been shown to have beneficial effects on human health. Essential oil from Hinoki cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa) is mostly used in commercial products such as air purifiers. However, the physiological/behavioral impact of essential oil from C. obtusa on insects is not established. In this study, we tested the effects of essential oil extracted from C. obtusa on the physiologies and behaviors of Drosophila melanogaster and Musca domestica. Exposure to essential oil from C. obtusa decreased the lifespan, fecundity, locomotive activity, and developmental success rate of D. melanogaster. In addition, both fruit flies and house flies showed strong repellent behavioral responses to the essential oil, with duration times of about 5 hours at 70 μg/ml. These results suggest that essential oil from C. obtusa can be used as a 'human-friendly' alternative insect repellent.",2015,"Shin-Hae Lee, Hyung-Seok Do, Kyung-Jin Min, Shin-Hae Lee, Hyung-Seok Do, Kyung-Jin Min"

"D. melanogaster, mitochondria and neurodegeneration: small model organism, big discoveries",22940086,10.1016/j.mcn.2012.08.007,"In developed countries, increased life expectancy is accompanied by an increased prevalence of age-related disorders like cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Albeit the molecular mechanisms behind the clinically, pathologically and etiologically heterogeneous forms of neurodegeneration are often unclear, impairment of mitochondrial fusion-fission and dynamics emerged in recent years as a feature of neuronal dysfunction and death, pinpointing the need for animal models to investigate the relationship between mitochondrial shape and neurodegeneration. While research on mammalian models is slowed down by the complexity of the organisms and their genomes, the long latency of the symptoms and by the difficulty to generate and analyze large cohorts, the lower metazoan Drosophila melanogaster overcomes these problems, proving to be a suitable model to study neurodegenerative diseases and mitochondria-shaping proteins.

In Drosophila melanogaster, a negative feedback loop of gene expression has been shown to contribute to the clock mechanism. Here, we describe some features of the circadian clock of the sandfly Lutzomyia longipalpis, a vector of visceral leishmaniasis. Compared to D. melanogaster, sandfly period and timeless, two negative elements of the feedback loop, show similar peaks of mRNA abundance. On the other hand, the expression of Clock (a positive transcription factor) differs between the two species, raising the possibility that the different phases of Clock expression could be associated with the observed differences in circadian activity rhythms. In addition, we show a reduction in locomotor activity after a blood meal, which is correlated with downregulation of period and timeless expression levels. Our results suggest that the circadian pacemaker and its control over the activity rhythms in this hematophagous insect are modulated by blood intake.",2006,"Antonio C A Meireles-Filho, Gustavo B da S Rivas, João S M Gesto, Ricardo C Machado, Constança Britto, Nataly A de Souza, Alexandre A Peixoto, Antonio C A Meireles-Filho, Gustavo B da S Rivas, João S M Gesto, Ricardo C Machado, Constança Britto, Nataly A de Souza, Alexandre A Peixoto"
Eu-heterochromatic rearrangements induce replication of heterochromatic sequences normally underreplicated in polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster,16020783,10.1534/genetics.105.044461,"In polytene chromosomes of D. melanogaster the heterochromatic pericentric regions are underreplicated (underrepresented). In this report, we analyze the effects of eu-heterochromatic rearrangements involving a cluster of the X-linked heterochromatic (Xh) Stellate repeats on the representation of these sequences in salivary gland polytene chromosomes. The discontinuous heterochromatic Stellate cluster contains specific restriction fragments that were mapped along the distal region of Xh. We found that transposition of a fragment of the Stellate cluster into euchromatin resulted in its replication in polytene chromosomes. Interestingly, only the Stellate repeats that remain within the pericentric Xh and are close to a new eu-heterochromatic boundary were replicated, strongly suggesting the existence of a spreading effect exerted by the adjacent euchromatin. Internal rearrangements of the distal Xh did not affect Stellate polytenization. We also demonstrated trans effects exerted by heterochromatic blocks on the replication of the rearranged heterochromatin; replication of transposed Stellate sequences was suppressed by a deletion of Xh and restored by addition of Y heterochromatin. This phenomenon is discussed in light of a possible role of heterochromatic proteins in the process of heterochromatin underrepresentation in polytene chromosomes.",2005,"Yuri A Abramov, Galina L Kogan, Eugenii V Tolchkov, Vanya I Rasheva, Sergei A Lavrov, Silvia Bonaccorsi, Irina A Kramerova, Vladimir A Gvozdev, Yuri A Abramov, Galina L Kogan, Eugenii V Tolchkov, Vanya I Rasheva, Sergei A Lavrov, Silvia Bonaccorsi, Irina A Kramerova, Vladimir A Gvozdev"
Stimulation of transcription by an Ultrabithorax protein in vitro,1974540,10.1101/gad.4.6.1044,"The Ultrabithorax (Ubx) gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a family of UBX proteins that are thought to specify the developmental fates of segments in the posterior thorax and anterior abdomen by controlling the expression of a set of target genes. UBX proteins bind DNA in vitro, and they activate or repress different natural and synthetic target promoters in cultured cells. Here it is shown that a purified UBX protein can stimulate transcription of a synthetic target gene in extracts of cultured D. melanogaster cells. Stimulation is dependent on the presence of upstream, promoter-region binding sites but is independent of binding site orientation. A naturally occurring binding site cluster and a binding site consensus sequence consisting of TAA trinucleotide repeats can mediate this activation. A minimal promoter fused to such sites is activated by UBX, suggesting that transcriptional stimulation could result from an interaction between the promoter-bound protein and the general transcriptional machinery.",1990,"F B Johnson, M A Krasnow, F B Johnson, M A Krasnow"
Parental age dependent changes as a source of genetic variation in Drosophila melanogaster,3145904,10.1007/BF00057761,"It has been shown repeatedly that numerous cumulative changes occur in chromosomes of D. melanogaster, as an effect of ageing which, especially in the homozygous state, significantly affect different fitness components of their carriers. It appears that the observed age-affected events are produced by systematic and ontogenetically programmed changes in genetic loads at specific chromosomes, which are transferable to following generations. It has been suggested that such changes could be of mutational origin, and that they could be more frequent at gene loci which are epigenetically active during ontogenesis. It was demonstrated that a large sample of identical chromosomes behave quite differently in the homozygous state when obtained from aged compared to non-aged parents, producing a significant decrease in relative viability, length of preadult development, and longevity of their carriers, as well as in the frequency of recombinations of corresponding chromosomes. A specific treatment by streptomycin resulted in remarkably milder effects of ageing, which is in accordance with the statement of some authors that such a treatment may diminish the frequency of spontaneous recessive mutations in their carriers. Thus the observed age-affected changes could be an important source of developmental and evolutionary variation of living organisms.",1988,"D Marinković, I Bajraktari, D Marinković, I Bajraktari"
The Genetic Structure of Natural Populations of DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER. Xvii. a Population Carrying Genetic Variability Explicable by the Classical Hypothesis,17246232,,"About 400 second chromosomes were extracted from the Aomori population, a northernmost population of D. melanogaster on Honshu in Japan, and the following experimental results were obtained. (1) The frequency of lethal chromosomes was 0.23. (2) The effective size of the population was estimated to be about 3000, from the allelism rate of lethal chromosomes and their frequency. (3) The detrimental and lethal loads for viability were 0.243 and 0.242, respectively, and the D/L ratio became 1.00. (4) The average degree of dominance for mildly deleterious genes was estimated to be 0.178 +/- 0.056. (5) Additive (sigma(2) (A)) and dominance (sigma(2) (D)) variances of viability were estimated to be 0.00276 +/- 0.00090 and 0.00011 +/- 0.00014, respectively. (6) There was no significant difference in environmental variances between homozygotes and heterozygotes. Using these estimates, we discuss the maintenance mechanisms of genetic variability of viability in the population. The mutation-selection balance explained these experimental results.",1984,"S Kusakabe, T Mukai, S Kusakabe, T Mukai"
"The molecular basis of I-R hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster: identification, cloning, and properties of the I factor",6088060,10.1016/0092-8674(84)90536-1,"We have analyzed two mutations of the white-eye gene, which arose in flies subject to I-R hybrid dysgenesis. These mutations are associated with insertions of apparently identical 5.4 kb sequences, which we have cloned. We believe that these insertions are copies of the I factor controlling I-R hybrid dysgenesis. The I factor is not a member of the copia-like or fold-back classes of transposable elements and has no sequence homology with the P factor that controls P-M dysgenesis. All strains of D. melanogaster contain I-factor sequences. Those present in reactive strains must represent inactive I elements. I elements have a remarkably similar sequence organization in all reactive strains and are located in peri-centromeric regions. Inducer strains appear to contain both I elements, located in peri-centromeric regions, and 10-15 copies of the complete I factor at sites on the chromosome arms.",1984,"A Bucheton, R Paro, H M Sang, A Pelisson, D J Finnegan, A Bucheton, R Paro, H M Sang, A Pelisson, D J Finnegan"
Rapid change of chromomeric and pairing patterns of polytene chromosome tips in D. melanogaster: migration of polytene-nonpolytene transition zone?,119667,,"The high variability of chromomeric patterns in near-terminal regions of polytene chromosome arms has been explored in a number of races, strains and hybrids of Drosophila melanogaster. Traditional explanations for tip differences between strains (differential compaction of chromatin, somatic or germinal deletion) are examined and, in the light of the reported observations, rejected. The range of polytene tip variability and rates of change in wild races are greater than has been supposed: strains formerly considered to be terminally deleted appear to gain terminal bands; others, formerly considered normal, appear to have lost them. Strains with high cell-to-cell tip variability are also described. Cell-to-cell variations, as well as much of the observed rapid changes in tip appearance, are probably due to heritable differences in the location of an abrupt transition zone between polytene and nonpolytene chromatin. A quantitative relationship between the amount of certain subterminal bands present and the frequency of tip association of nonhomologous chromosomes is shown and its possible significance for chromosome is shown and its possible for chromosome pairing discussed.",1979,"P A Roberts, P A Roberts"
A method for fate mapping the foci of lethal and behavioral mutants in Drosophila melanogaster,405277,,"A new method of mosaic fate mapping, called focusing, is introduced. Its advantages are that it allows a mapping, on the blastoderm surface, of the site of action of functions defined by either pre-adult lethal or behavioral mutations. Moreover, it does not require that the mosaics used be 50% of one genotype and 50% of the other. Methods for quantitative evaluation of the results of focusing, and a comparison of this method with others, are discussed.--Focusing is applied to the analysis of a new mutant, doomed (symbol: dmd), a distally located X-linked recessive in D. melanogaster, that causes the deaths of males and females around the time of eclosion. The dmd phenotype among eclosing flies is first seen as the loss of thoracic motor coordination and as ether sensitivity. Fate mapping by the method of focusing places the site of action of the dmd+ function in the same region of the map as that of the thoracic neural ganglia primordia, but not that of muscle, suggesting the possibility that the effect of dmd is on a thoracic neural function rather than a muscular one.",1977,"J R Flanagan, J R Flanagan"
Enzyme and chromosome polymorphisms in Japanese natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster,405274,,"Collections of D. melanogaster from Japanese populations were analyzed for enzyme and chromosomal polymorphisms. Allelic frequencies at the Adh and alphaGpd loci were compared with polymorphic inversion (In(2L)B, In(2R)C) frequencies in the second chromosome. There was a significant positive correlation between the frequencies of AdhS and In(2L)B, caused by linkage. On the other hand, inversion-free cage populations maintained in the laboratory for a long time showed considerably larger variation in the frequencies of these enzyme alleles, which seem very likely to be a consequence of random drift. Two fitness components of these enzyme and chromosomal variants were measured in two different environmental conditions; neither of the two loci showed heterozygote superiority in viability or productivity, while the inversion heterozygotes showed a superior productivity compared to the corresponding homozygotes in the fluctuating environment. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that polymorphic isozyme genes are maintained by random drift of neutral genes in natural populations, and that association with linked inversions is a historical accident.",1977,"T K Watanabe, T Watanabe, T K Watanabe, T Watanabe"

"Similar rates of protein adaptation in Drosophila miranda and D. melanogaster, two species with different current effective population sizes",19091130,10.1186/1471-2148-8-334,"Background:
      
    

    
      Adaptive protein evolution is common in several Drosophila species investigated. Some studies point to very weak selection operating on amino-acid mutations, with average selection intensities on the order of Nes approximately in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Species with lower effective population sizes should undergo less adaptation since they generate fewer mutations and selection is ineffective on a greater proportion of beneficial mutations.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here I study patterns of polymorphism and divergence at 91 X-linked loci in D. miranda, a species with a roughly 5-fold smaller effective population size than D. melanogaster. Surprisingly, I find a similar fraction of amino-acid mutations being driven to fixation by positive selection in D. miranda and D. melanogaster. Genes with higher rates of amino-acid evolution show lower levels of neutral diversity, a pattern predicted by recurrent adaptive protein evolution. I fit a hitchhiking model to patterns of polymorphism in D. miranda and D. melanogaster and estimate an order of magnitude higher selection coefficients for beneficial mutations in D. miranda.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      This analysis suggests that effective population size may not be a major determinant in rates of protein adaptation. Instead, adaptation may not be mutation-limited, or the distribution of fitness effects for beneficial mutations might differ vastly between different species or populations. Alternative explanation such as biases in estimating the fraction of beneficial mutations or slightly deleterious mutation models are also discussed.",2008,"Doris Bachtrog, Doris Bachtrog"
"Compared ontogenesis of courtship song components of males from the sibling species, D. melanogaster and D. simulans",11699602,10.1023/a:1012231409691,"The courtship song of Drosophila is known to be an important signal involved in sex and species recognition. It consists of pulse song and sine song, which have been studied in a quantitative way with different parameters. For the first time the setting of both components of the acoustic signaling is described and compared for males belonging to the sibling species D. melanogaster and D. simulans. At early ages, these two species share similar interpulse interval values but maturation establishes the species specificity of this character. For D. melanogaster the variations of several acoustic parameters take place in two successive periods, whereas for D. simulans the majority of the acoustic features does not change much with age. In D. melanogaster, copulation success seems to be linked to the maturation of the acoustic performance, which is not the case for D. simulans.",2001,"B Moulin, F Rybak, T Aubin, J M Jallon, B Moulin, F Rybak, T Aubin, J M Jallon"

Monoclonal anti-H1 histone autoantibodies from unimmunized Balb/c mice. Specificity and VH and VL domain sequences,7916905,10.1006/jaut.1994.1022,"Examination of the nuclear reactivities of monoclonal IgM kappa autoantibodies, secreted by GFM-5 1B12 and NU-6 1F12 hybridomas derived from germ-free and nude mice, respectively, demonstrated homogeneous nuclear immunofluorescence staining patterns consistent with the recognition of histones. Under these conditions, GFM-5 1B12 and NU-6 1F12 mAbs produced species non-specific binding to components within the nuclei of mouse, human and Drosophila melanogaster cells. Immunoblotting confirmed the binding of these two autoantibodies to autologous H1 histones as well as bovine and insect H1 histones. Identification of the epitopes bound by GFM-5 1B12 and NU-6 1F12 mAbs within the D. melanogaster H1 histones was undertaken using 248 overlapping octapeptides encompassing the entire sequence of D. melanogaster H1 histones. GFM-5 1B12 mAbs bound several octapeptides derived from the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of D. melanogaster H1 histones with accessible KT, AT or VT amino acids. NU-6 1F12 mAbs, which stained nuclei within sections of D. melanogaster lavae, failed to bind to any of the 248 linear octapeptides, implying recognition of a conformational H1 histone epitope by this autoantibody. ELISA analysis of the polyspecific binding properties of GFM-5 1B12 and NU-6 1F12 mAbs demonstrated that both antibodies exhibited unique polyspecificity profiles. GFM-5 1B12 mAbs recognized bovine carbonic anhydrase and mouse IgG1, while NU-6 1F12 bound bovine cardiolipin, rat cytochrome c, Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase, toxoid from Clostridium tetani, mouse IgG1 and the haptens, DNP and FITC from the 24 antigen test panel. Comparison of the VH and VL domain sequences of GFM-5 1B12 and NU-6 1F12 mAbs demonstrated that the variations in autoreactivity and polyspecificity profiles resulted from amino acid variations in the CDRs of the VH and VL domains of these autoantibodies. Significantly, major differences in the VH domain sequences of the NU-5 1F12 and GFM-5 1B12 mAbs suggest that the VH domains may preferentially contribute to the unique specificities of the two anti-H1 histone autoantibodies.",1994,"J R Underwood, G A Cartwright, A M McCall, G Tribbick, M H Geysen, M T Hearn, J R Underwood, G A Cartwright, A M McCall, G Tribbick, M H Geysen, M T Hearn"
BMP signaling dynamics in the follicle cells of multiple Drosophila species,21402065,10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.03.005,"The dorsal anterior region of the follicle cells (FCs) in the developing Drosophila egg gives rise to the respiratory eggshell appendages. These tubular structures display a wide range of qualitative and quantitative variations across Drosophila species, providing a remarkable example of a rapidly evolving morphology. In D. melanogaster, the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway is an important regulator of FCs patterning and dorsal appendages morphology. To explore the mechanisms underlying the diversification of eggshell patterning, we analyzed BMP signaling in the FCs of 16 Drosophila species that span 45 million years of evolution. We found that the spatial patterns of BMP signaling in the FCs are dynamic and exhibit a range of interspecies' variations. In most of the species examined, the dynamics of BMP signaling correlate with the expression of the type I BMP receptor thickveins (tkv). This correlation suggests that interspecies' variations of tkv expression are responsible for the diversification of BMP signaling during oogenesis. This model was supported by genetic manipulations of tkv expression in the FCs of D. melanogaster that successfully recapitulated the signaling diversities found in the other species. Our results suggest that regulation of receptor expression mediates spatial diversification of BMP signaling in Drosophila oogenesis, and they provide insight into a mechanism underlying the evolution of eggshell patterning.",2011,"Matthew G Niepielko, Yainna Hernáiz-Hernández, Nir Yakoby, Matthew G Niepielko, Yainna Hernáiz-Hernández, Nir Yakoby"

Multi-enhancer transcriptional hubs confer phenotypic robustness,31294690,10.7554/eLife.45325,"We previously showed in Drosophila melanogaster embryos that low-affinity Ultrabithorax (Ubx)-responsive shavenbaby (svb) enhancers drive expression using localized transcriptional environments and that active svb enhancers on different chromosomes tended to colocalize (Tsai et al., 2017). Here, we test the hypothesis that these multi-enhancer 'hubs' improve phenotypic resilience to stress by buffering against decreases in transcription factor concentrations and transcriptional output. Deleting a redundant enhancer from the svb locus led to reduced trichome numbers in embryos raised at elevated temperatures. Using high-resolution fluorescence microscopy, we observed lower Ubx concentration and transcriptional output in this deletion allele. Transcription sites of the full svb cis-regulatory region inserted into a different chromosome colocalized with the svb locus, increasing Ubx concentration, the transcriptional output of svb, and partially rescuing the phenotype. Thus, multiple enhancers could reinforce a local transcriptional hub to buffer against environmental stresses and genetic perturbations, providing a mechanism for phenotypical robustness.",2019,"Albert Tsai, Mariana Rp Alves, Justin Crocker, Albert Tsai, Mariana Rp Alves, Justin Crocker"
Assembling large genomes with single-molecule sequencing and locality-sensitive hashing,26006009,10.1038/nbt.3238,"Long-read, single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing is routinely used to finish microbial genomes, but available assembly methods have not scaled well to larger genomes. We introduce the MinHash Alignment Process (MHAP) for overlapping noisy, long reads using probabilistic, locality-sensitive hashing. Integrating MHAP with the Celera Assembler enabled reference-grade de novo assemblies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster and a human hydatidiform mole cell line (CHM1) from SMRT sequencing. The resulting assemblies are highly continuous, include fully resolved chromosome arms and close persistent gaps in these reference genomes. Our assembly of D. melanogaster revealed previously unknown heterochromatic and telomeric transition sequences, and we assembled low-complexity sequences from CHM1 that fill gaps in the human GRCh38 reference. Using MHAP and the Celera Assembler, single-molecule sequencing can produce de novo near-complete eukaryotic assemblies that are 99.99% accurate when compared with available reference genomes.",2015,"Konstantin Berlin, Sergey Koren, Chen-Shan Chin, James P Drake, Jane M Landolin, Adam M Phillippy, Konstantin Berlin, Sergey Koren, Chen-Shan Chin, James P Drake, Jane M Landolin, Adam M Phillippy"

B. mori SOD was also close to the D. melanogaster SOD in a phylogenetic tree. The bmSOD mRNA and the enzyme activity were widely distributed in diverse tissues. bmSOD functionally overexpressed in Escherichia coli in a soluble form was purified, and its stability was examined. bmSOD at 4 degrees C retained almost all of its original activity after incubation at pH 4-11 for 24 h.

In order to more fully understand the molecular biology of olfaction in this insect, we have previously identified several members member of a family of candidate odorant receptor proteins from A. gambiae (AgORs). Here we report the cloning and characterization of an additional AgOR gene, denoted as AgOr5, which shows significant similarity to putative odorant receptors in A. gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster and which is selectively expressed in olfactory organs. AgOr5 is tightly clustered within the A. gambiae genome to two other highly homologous candidate odorant receptors, suggesting that these genes are derived from a common ancestor. Analysis of the developmental expression within members of this AgOR gene cluster reveals considerable variation between these AgORs as compared to candidate odorant receptors from D. melanogaster.",2002,"A N Fox, R J Pitts, L J Zwiebel, A N Fox, R J Pitts, L J Zwiebel"
Relationship of transcription of Drosophila melanogaster gene CG11327 and the gene for a thrombospondin homologue (DTSP),11916261,10.3109/10425170109025002,"Because of the close proximity of D. melanogaster gene CG11327 and the gene for a thrombospondin homologue (DTSP), the relationship between transcription of the two genes has been investigated. As part of this study, the cDNA sequence of gene CG11327 was determined, and structural features of the encoded protein were characterized. The CG11327 open reading frame specifies a polypeptide of 475 amino acid residues, molecular weight 53,666. The highly acidic protein has an aspartic acid + glutamic acid content of 23.2%. Weak similarities to other proteins suggest that it may function as a transcription factor or structural protein of the cell cycle. The existence of overlapping transcripts was found to be a significant feature of transcription of gene CG11327 and the DTSP gene. The 3' end of the DTSP gene overlaps the 5' end of gene CG11327 by at least 177bp, and the region of overlap includes exon 13 and the 3' UTR of the DTSP gene.",2001,"K W Adolph, K W Adolph"
The X chromosome is a hot spot for sexually antagonistic fitness variation,11886642,10.1098/rspb.2001.1863,"Sexually antagonistic alleles are selected discordantly between the sexes. Experimental evidence indicates that sexually antagonistic fitness variation is abundant in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Theory predicts that the X chromosome will be enriched with this type of variation. To test this prediction in D. melanogaster, we sampled, and cytogenetically cloned, 20 X chromosomes and compared their fitness variation to genome-wide levels. At the juvenile stage, in which gender roles are most similar, the X chromosome made no detectable contribution to genome-wide fitness variation. At the adult stage, in which gender roles diverge, the X chromosome was estimated to harbour 45% of the genome-wide fitness variation and 97% of the genome-wide sexually antagonistic variation. This genomic structure has important implications for the process of sexual selection because X-linked sexually antagonistic variation contributes to negative intersexual heritability for fitness, i.e. high-fitness males (females) produce, on average, low-fitness daughters (sons).",2002,"Jonathan R Gibson, Adam K Chippindale, William R Rice, Jonathan R Gibson, Adam K Chippindale, William R Rice"

The amino acid sequence of these three peptides were identified. The two small peptides are joined to the large peptide by disulfide bridges. The amino acid sequence of RNase CL1 had 62 (31.2%) and 63 residues (31.6%) identical with oyster RNase and D. melanogaster RNase, respectively, and belongs to the RNase T2 family RNase.

We have isolated a gene in the medfly using the cloned Drosophila melanogaster 5C actin gene as a probe. This medfly gene detects abundant messages present during late larval and late pupal development as well as in thoracic and leg tissue preparations from newly emerged adults.

Neural control of homosexual courtship in Drosophila melanogaster,2516530,10.3109/01677068909107103,"Immature D. melanogaster males, like virgin females, often elicit vigorous courtship from mature males. Since males perform the same behaviors in response to attractive males and females, the question arises as to whether the foci--cells in the courting male's nervous system that must be haplo-X for the fly to perform a behavior--are the same for homosexual and heterosexual courtship. To answer this question, we analyzed the behaviors that normal males perform in response to sexually attractive flies. From these data, we calculated the probabilities that a fly with haplo-X tissue in a focus for homosexual and heterosexual courtship would perform the behavior in response to one or both of the two sex objects with which it was tested. Next, we observed the courtship behaviors that gynandromorphs (sex mosaics) performed in response to attractive males and females. Since the numbers of mosaics that performed a behavior in response to one or both of the sex objects with which they were tested were not significantly different from the predicted values, we conclude that the foci for performance of homosexual and heterosexual courtship are almost certainly identical.",1989,"L M Napolitano, L Tompkins, L M Napolitano, L Tompkins"
Projection patterns of different types of antennal sensilla in the antennal glomeruli of Drosophila melanogaster,6411344,10.1007/BF00213783,"Cobalt fills from small, defined regions of the antenna in D. melanogaster show that the three types of sensilla on the third segment, the flagellum, and a fourth sensillum located in the arista, project into the glomeruli of the antennal lobe. We have identified 19 glomeruli in each lobe, according to their location, shape, and size. At least ten of these represent major projection areas of flagellar or aristal sensilla. The large majority of glomeruli is innervated from both antennae, but a small group of five receive exclusively ipsilateral input. A particular sensory fiber appears to terminate only in one specific glomerulus, either in the ipsilateral or in both lobes. Fills from flagellar regions bearing a single type of sensillum, yield a specific pattern of glomeruli containing stained terminals. Aristal projections remain strictly ipsilateral, whereas those from the other sensilla consist of an ipsilateral and a bilateral component. When filling from different points in an area bearing one type of sensillum, similar projections are produced, suggesting that projection patterns observed reflect predominantly the type of sensillum rather than its location on the flagellum. Accordingly, individual glomeruli might represent functional units, each receiving antennal input in a characteristic combination.",1983,"R F Stocker, R N Singh, M Schorderet, O Siddiqi, R F Stocker, R N Singh, M Schorderet, O Siddiqi"

Heating of oocytes in F2t1 females ""preliminarily heated in the F1 generation showed that the stability curve for the oocytes after ""preliminary"" heating during the critical developmental period exhibited an abrupt decrease rather than the anticipated rise, which can only be attributed to an adaptive increase in oocyte thermostability as a result of preliminary heating.",1975,"P G Svetlov, G F Korsakova, P G Svetlov, G F Korsakova"

Serotonin signaling mediates protein valuation and aging,27572262,10.7554/eLife.16843,"Research into how protein restriction improves organismal health and lengthens lifespan has largely focused on cell-autonomous processes. In certain instances, however, nutrient effects on lifespan are independent of consumption, leading us to test the hypothesis that central, cell non-autonomous processes are important protein restriction regulators. We characterized a transient feeding preference for dietary protein after modest starvation in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and identified tryptophan hydroxylase (Trh), serotonin receptor 2a (5HT2a), and the solute carrier 7-family amino acid transporter, JhI-21, as required for this preference through their role in establishing protein value. Disruption of any one of these genes increased lifespan up to 90% independent of food intake suggesting the perceived value of dietary protein is a critical determinant of its effect on lifespan. Evolutionarily conserved neuromodulatory systems that define neural states of nutrient demand and reward are therefore sufficient to control aging and physiology independent of food consumption.",2016,"Jennifer Ro, Gloria Pak, Paige A Malec, Yang Lyu, David B Allison, Robert T Kennedy, Scott D Pletcher, Jennifer Ro, Gloria Pak, Paige A Malec, Yang Lyu, David B Allison, Robert T Kennedy, Scott D Pletcher"
Double nexus--Doublesex is the connecting element in sex determination,25797692,10.1093/bfgp/elv005,"In recent years, our knowledge of the conserved master-switch gene doublesex (dsx) and its function in regulating the development of dimorphic traits in insects has deepened considerably. Here, a comprehensive overview is given on the properties of the male- and female-specific dsx transcripts yielding DSX(F) and DSX(M) proteins in Drosophila melanogaster, and the many downstream targets that they regulate. As insects have cell-autonomous sex determination, it was assumed that dsx would be expressed in every somatic cell, but recent research showed that dsx is expressed only when a cell is required to show its sexual identity through function or morphology. This spatiotemporal regulation of dsx expression has not only been established in D. melanogaster but in all insect species studied. Gradually, it has been appreciated that dsx could no longer be viewed as the master-switch gene orchestrating sexual development and behaviour in each cell, but instead should be viewed as the interpreter for the sexual identity of the cell, expressing this identity only on request, making dsx the central nexus of insect sex determination.",2015,"Eveline C Verhulst, Louis van de Zande, Eveline C Verhulst, Louis van de Zande"
Conservation of fruitless' role as master regulator of male courtship behaviour from cockroaches to flies,21340608,10.1007/s00427-011-0352-x,"In Drosophila melanogaster, male courtship behaviour is regulated by the fruitless gene. In D. melanogaster, fruitless encodes a set of putative transcription factors that are sex-specifically spliced. Male-specific variants are necessary and sufficient to elicit male courtship behaviour. Fruitless sequences have been reported in other insect species, but there are no data available on their functional role. In the present work, we cloned and sequenced fruitless in males of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, and we studied its expression in male brain and testes. B. germanica fruitless encodes a 350-amino acid protein with BTB and Zinc finger domains typical of fruitless sequences. Upon RNAi-mediated knockdown of fruitless in B. germanica, males no longer exhibit courtship behaviour, thus implying that fruitless is necessary for male sexual behaviour in our cockroach model. This suggests that the role of fruitless as master regulator of male sexual behaviour has been conserved along insect evolution, at least from cockroaches to flies.",2011,"Elke Clynen, Laura Ciudad, Xavier Bellés, Maria-Dolors Piulachs, Elke Clynen, Laura Ciudad, Xavier Bellés, Maria-Dolors Piulachs"
Regulation of Ubx expression by epigenetic enhancer silencing in response to Ubx levels and genetic variation,19730678,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000633,"For gene products that must be present in cells at defined concentrations, expression levels must be tightly controlled to ensure robustness against environmental, genetic, and developmental noise. By studying the regulation of the concentration-sensitive Drosophila melanogaster Hox gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx), we found that Ubx enhancer activities respond to both increases in Ubx levels and genetic background. Large, transient increases in Ubx levels are capable of silencing all enhancer input into Ubx transcription, resulting in the complete silencing of this gene. Small increases in Ubx levels, brought about by duplications of the Ubx locus, cause sporadic silencing of subsets of Ubx enhancers. Ubx enhancer silencing can also be induced by outcrossing laboratory stocks to D. melanogaster strains established from wild flies from around the world. These results suggest that enhancer activities are not rigidly determined, but instead are sensitive to genetic background. Together, these findings suggest that enhancer silencing may be used to maintain gene product levels within the correct range in response to natural genetic variation.",2009,"Michael A Crickmore, Vikram Ranade, Richard S Mann, Michael A Crickmore, Vikram Ranade, Richard S Mann"

These elements were coined as ""egoistic DNA"" whose amplification may be restricted as a result of unknown types of interactions with the host genome. Correlations of the extent of amplification of heterochromatin elements with the fitness of individuals, reproductivity, and capability to transmit to the progeny a chromosome carrying the amplified heterochromatic region are discussed. The possible dependence of the genotypic structure and the fate of population in successive generations on the events of amplification of repeated heterochromatic elements in parental genomes is accentuated.

A study of linkage disequilibrium in populations of Drosophila melanogaster,4633160,,"This paper presents the results of a study of linkage disequilibrium between five polymorphic enzyme genes located on chromosome 3 of D. melanogaster.

Out of the thirty possible tests for linkage disequilibrium between pairs of loci, two were significant at the 5% level and two at the 1% level. This result cannot reasonably be ascribed to chance alone. The pairs of loci that had a significant correlation in one sample had higher than average correlations in the other samples (though not necessarily in the same direction); this effect was highly significant statistically. There was no tendency for the high correlations to be associated with tightness of linkage between the loci concerned. All five loci were involved in at least one significant effect.

The swallow gene of D. melanogaster plays an essential role in localizing bicoid mRNA in oocytes, and swallow mutant embryos show anterior pattern defects that result from the lack of localization of the bicoid morphogen. The pseudoobscura homologue rescues the function of swallow mutants when introduced into the genome of D. melanogaster, and its expression is similar to that of the melanogaster gene. The predicted pseudoobscura and melanogaster proteins are 49% identical and 69% conserved. The coiled-coil domain previously identified in the melanogaster swallow protein is strongly conserved in the pseudoobscura homologue, but the weak similarity of the melanogaster swallow protein to the RNP class of RNA-binding proteins is not conserved in the pseudoobscura homologue.

As a first step towards molecular isolation of a 'speciation gene', I mapped and partly characterized a gene causing hybrid male sterility in Drosophila. This analysis shows that sterility of D. melanogaster males who carry the 'dot' fourth chromosome from D. simulans is due entirely to a very small region of the D. simulans chromosome (including only about 5 salivary gland bands or approximately 250 kb of DNA). Thus the hybrid sterility effect of the D. simulans fourth chromosome is almost surely due to a single gene of very large effect (here named hms, hybrid male sterile). Hms is zygotically acting, and the D. simulans allele of hms is completely recessive. Furthermore, complementation tests suggest that hms is not an allele of any known locus in D. melanogaster.",1992,"H A Orr, H A Orr"

In all species studied, one hybridization signal was detected for the gdh and E74 genes, and seven signals for the actin genes. The distribution of the actin-related loci in five montium species is similar to that of the other Drosophila species studied so far, although they present an extra signal. This distribution differs in the sixth montium species studied, D. kikkawai. Taking into account the present results, as well as previous data obtained mainly by in situ hybridizations, homologies among the polytene chromosomes of the montium subgroup species, as well as between these species and D. melanogaster, were also established.",1997,"E Drosopoulou, M Tsiafouli, P Mavragani-Tsipidou, Z G Scouras, E Drosopoulou, M Tsiafouli, P Mavragani-Tsipidou, Z G Scouras"
Slip-sliding away: serial changes and homoplasy in repeat number in the Drosophila yakuba homolog of human cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2,20543987,10.1371/journal.pone.0011006,"Several recent studies have examined the function and evolution of a Drosophila homolog to the human breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2, named dmbrca2. We previously identified what appeared to be a recent expansion in the RAD51-binding BRC-repeat array in the ancestor of Drosophila yakuba. In this study, we examine patterns of variation and evolution of the dmbrca2 BRC-repeat array within D. yakuba and its close relatives. We develop a model of how unequal crossing over may have produced the expanded form, but we also observe short repeat forms, typical of other species in the D. melanogaster group, segregating within D. yakuba and D. santomea. These short forms do not appear to be identical-by-descent, suggesting that the history of dmbrca2 in the D. melanogaster subgroup has involved repeat unit contractions resulting in homoplasious forms. We conclude that the evolutionary history of dmbrca2 in D. yakuba and perhaps in other Drosophila species may be more complicated than can be inferred from examination of the published single genome sequences per species.",2010,"Sarah M Bennett, John M Mercer, Mohamed A F Noor, Sarah M Bennett, John M Mercer, Mohamed A F Noor"
Switch in codon bias and increased rates of amino acid substitution in the Drosophila saltans species group,10471717,,"We investigated the nucleotide composition of five genes, Xdh, Adh, Sod, Per, and 28SrRNA, in nine species of Drosophila (subgenus Sophophora) and one of Scaptodrosophila. The six species of the Drosophila saltans group markedly differ from the others in GC content and codon use bias. The GC content in the third codon position, and to a lesser extent in the first position and the introns, is higher in the D. melanogaster and D. obscura groups than in the D. saltans group (in Scaptodrosophila it is intermediate but closer to the melanogaster and obscura species). Differences are greater for Xdh than for Adh, Sod, Per, and 28SrRNA, which are functionally more constrained. We infer that rapid evolution of GC content in the saltans lineage is largely due to a shift in mutation pressure, which may have been associated with diminished natural selection due to smaller effective population numbers rather than reduced recombination rates. The rate of GC content evolution impacts the rate of protein evolution and may distort phylogenetic inferences. Previous observations suggesting that GC content evolution is very limited in Drosophila may have been distorted due to the restricted number of genes and species (mostly D. melanogaster) investigated.",1999,"F Rodríguez-Trelles, R Tarrío, F J Ayala, F Rodríguez-Trelles, R Tarrío, F J Ayala"
Low codon bias and high rates of synonymous substitution in Drosophila hydei and D. melanogaster histone genes,8487638,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040011,"We have evaluated codon usage bias in Drosophila histone genes and have obtained the nucleotide sequence of a 5,161-bp D. hydei histone gene repeat unit. This repeat contains genes for all five histone proteins (H1, H2a, H2b, H3, and H4) and differs from the previously reported one by a second EcoRI site. These D. hydei repeats have been aligned to each other and to the 5.0-kb (i.e., long) and 4.8-kb (i.e., short) histone repeat types from D. melanogaster. In each species, base composition at synonymous sites is similar to the average genomic composition and approaches that in the small intergenic spacers of the histone gene repeats. Accumulation of synonymous changes at synonymous sites after the species diverged is quite high. Both of these features are consistent with the relatively low codon usage bias observed in these genes when compared with other Drosophila genes. Thus, the generalization that abundantly expressed genes in Drosophila have high codon bias and low rates of silent substitution does not hold for the histone genes.",1993,"D H Fitch, L D Strausbaugh, D H Fitch, L D Strausbaugh"
Porphyromonas gingivalis virulence in a Drosophila melanogaster model,21041487,10.1128/IAI.00784-10,"Porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated in the etiology of adult periodontitis. In this study, we examined the viability of Drosophila melanogaster as a new model for examining P. gingivalis-host interactions. P. gingivalis (W83) infection of Drosophila resulted in a systemic infection that killed in a dose-dependent manner. Differences in the virulence of several clinically prevalent P. gingivalis strains were observed in the Drosophila killing model, and the results correlated well with studies in mammalian infection models and human epidemiologic studies. P. gingivalis pathobiology in Drosophila did not result from uncontrolled growth of the bacterium in the Drosophila hemolymph (blood) or overt damage to Drosophila tissues. P. gingivalis killing of Drosophila was multifactorial, involving several bacterial factors that are also involved in virulence in mammals. The results from this study suggest that many aspects of P. gingivalis pathogenesis in mammals are conserved in Drosophila, and thus the Drosophila killing model should be useful for characterizing P. gingivalis-host interactions and, potentially, polymicrobe-host interactions.",2011,"Christina O Igboin, Melvin L Moeschberger, Ann L Griffen, Eugene J Leys, Christina O Igboin, Melvin L Moeschberger, Ann L Griffen, Eugene J Leys"

Rearing the Fruit Fly Drosophila melanogaster Under Axenic and Gnotobiotic Conditions,27500374,10.3791/54219,"The influence of microbes on myriad animal traits and behaviors has been increasingly recognized in recent years. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a model for understanding microbial interactions with animal hosts, facilitated by approaches to rear large sample sizes of Drosophila under microorganism-free (axenic) conditions, or with defined microbial communities (gnotobiotic). This work outlines a method for collection of Drosophila embryos, hypochlorite dechorionation and sterilization, and transfer to sterile diet. Sterilized embryos are transferred to sterile diet in 50 ml centrifuge tubes, and developing larvae and adults remain free of any exogenous microbes until the vials are opened. Alternatively, flies with a defined microbiota can be reared by inoculating sterile diet and embryos with microbial species of interest. We describe the introduction of 4 bacterial species to establish a representative gnotobiotic microbiota in Drosophila. Finally, we describe approaches for confirming bacterial community composition, including testing if axenic Drosophila remain bacteria-free into adulthood.",2016,"Melinda L Koyle, Madeline Veloz, Alec M Judd, Adam C-N Wong, Peter D Newell, Angela E Douglas, John M Chaston, Melinda L Koyle, Madeline Veloz, Alec M Judd, Adam C-N Wong, Peter D Newell, Angela E Douglas, John M Chaston"

Developmental nicotine exposure affects larval brain size and the adult dopaminergic system of Drosophila melanogaster,29898654,10.1186/s12861-018-0172-6,"Background:
      
    

    
      Pregnant women may be exposed to nicotine if they smoke or use tobacco products, nicotine replacement therapy, or via e-cigarettes. Prenatal nicotine exposure has been shown to have deleterious effects on the nervous system in mammals including changes in brain size and in the dopaminergic system. The genetic and molecular mechanisms for these changes are not well understood. A Drosophila melanogaster model for these effects of nicotine exposure could contribute to faster identification of genes and molecular pathways underlying these effects. The purpose of this study was to determine if developmental nicotine exposure affects the nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster, focusing on changes to brain size and the dopaminergic system at two developmental stages.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We reared flies on control or nicotine food from egg to 3rd instar larvae or from egg to adult and determined effectiveness of the nicotine treatment. We used immunohistochemistry to visualize the whole brain and dopaminergic neurons, using tyrosine hydroxylase as the marker. We measured brain area, tyrosine hydroxylase fluorescence, and counted the number of dopaminergic neurons in brain clusters. We detected an increase in larval brain hemisphere area, a decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase fluorescence in adult central brains, and a decrease in the number of neurons in the PPM3 adult dopaminergic cluster. We tested involvement of Dα7, one of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits, and found it was involved in eclosion, as previously described, but not involved in brain size.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We conclude that developmental nicotine exposure in Drosophila melanogaster affects brain size and the dopaminergic system. Prenatal nicotine exposure in mammals has also been shown to have effects on brain size and in the dopaminergic system. This study further establishes Drosophila melanogaster as model organism to study the effects of developmental nicotine exposure. The genetic and molecular tools available for Drosophila research will allow elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the effects of nicotine exposure during development.",2018,"Melanie Morris, Ariel Shaw, Madison Lambert, Haley Halperin Perry, Eve Lowenstein, David Valenzuela, Norma Andrea Velazquez-Ulloa, Melanie Morris, Ariel Shaw, Madison Lambert, Haley Halperin Perry, Eve Lowenstein, David Valenzuela, Norma Andrea Velazquez-Ulloa"

"Interspecific divergence of transcription networks along lines of genetic variance in Drosophila: dimensionality, evolvability, and constraint",23519314,10.1093/molbev/mst047,"Change in gene expression is a major facilitator of phenotypic evolution. Understanding the evolutionary potential of gene expression requires taking into account complex systems of regulatory networks, the structure of which could potentially bias evolutionary trajectories. We analyzed the evolutionary potential and divergence of multigene expression in three well-characterized signaling pathways in Drosophila, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MapK), the Toll, and the insulin receptor/Foxo (InR/Foxo or InR/TOR) pathways in a multivariate quantitative genetic framework. Gene expression data from a natural population of D. melanogaster were used to estimate the genetic variance-covariance matrices (G) for each network. Although most genes within each pathway exhibited significant genetic variance, the number of independent dimensions of multivariate genetic variance was fewer than the number of genes analyzed. However, for expression, the reduction in dimensionality was not as large as seen for other trait types such as morphology. We then tested whether gene expression divergence between D. melanogaster and an additional six species of the Drosophila genus was biased along the major axes of standing variation observed in D. melanogaster. In many cases, divergence was restricted to directions of phenotypic space harboring above average levels of genetic variance in D. melanogaster, indicating that genetic covariances between genes within pathways have biased interspecific divergence. We tested whether co-expression of genes in both sexes has also biased the pattern of divergence. Including cross-sex genetic covariances increased the degree to which divergence was biased along major axes of genetic variance, suggesting that the co-expression of genes in males and females can generate further constraints on divergence across the Drosophila phylogeny. In contrast to patterns seen for morphological traits in vertebrates, transcriptional constraints do not appear to break down as divergence time between species increases, instead they persist over tens of millions of years of divergence.",2013,"Paolo Innocenti, Stephen F Chenoweth, Paolo Innocenti, Stephen F Chenoweth"

Polymorphisms in early neurodevelopmental genes affect natural variation in alcohol sensitivity in adult drosophila,26503115,10.1186/s12864-015-2064-5,"Background:
      
    

    
      Alcohol abuse and alcoholism are significant public health problems, but the genetic basis for individual variation in alcohol sensitivity remains poorly understood. Drosophila melanogaster presents a powerful model system for dissecting the genetic underpinnings that determine individual variation in alcohol-related phenotypes. We performed genome wide association analyses for alcohol sensitivity using the sequenced, inbred lines of the D. melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) together with extreme QTL mapping in an advanced intercross population derived from sensitive and resistant DGRP lines.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The DGRP harbors substantial genetic variation for alcohol sensitivity and tolerance. We identified 247 candidate genes affecting alcohol sensitivity in the DGRP or the DGRP-derived advanced intercross population, some of which met a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold, while others occurred among the top candidate genes associated with variation in alcohol sensitivity in multiple analyses. Among these were candidate genes associated with development and function of the nervous system, including several genes in the Dopamine decarboxylase (Ddc) cluster involved in catecholamine synthesis. We found that 58 of these genes formed a genetic interaction network. We verified candidate genes using mutational analysis, targeted gene disruption through RNAi knock-down and transcriptional profiling. Two-thirds of the candidate genes have been implicated in previous Drosophila, mouse and human studies of alcohol-related phenotypes.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Individual variation in alcohol sensitivity in Drosophila is highly polygenic and in part determined by variation in evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways that are associated with catecholamine neurotransmitter biosynthesis and early development of the nervous system.",2015,"Tatiana V Morozova, Wen Huang, Victoria A Pray, Thomas Whitham, Robert R H Anholt, Trudy F C Mackay, Tatiana V Morozova, Wen Huang, Victoria A Pray, Thomas Whitham, Robert R H Anholt, Trudy F C Mackay"
Transferrin 1 Functions in Iron Trafficking and Genetically Interacts with Ferritin in Drosophila melanogaster,30650364,10.1016/j.celrep.2018.12.053,"Iron metabolism is an essential process that when dysregulated causes disease. Mammalian serum transferrin (TF) plays a primary role in delivering iron to cells. To improve our understanding of the conservation of iron metabolism between species, we investigate here the function of the TF homolog in Drosophila melanogaster, transferrin 1 (Tsf1). Tsf1 knockdown results in iron accumulation in the gut and iron deficiency in the fat body (which is analogous to the mammalian liver). Fat body-derived Tsf1 localizes to the gut surface, suggesting that Tsf1 functions in trafficking iron between the gut and the fat body, similar to TF in mammals. Moreover, Tsf1 knockdown strongly suppresses the phenotypic effects of ferritin (Fer1HCH) RNAi, an established iron trafficker in Drosophila. We propose that Tsf1 and ferritin compete for iron in the Drosophila intestine and demonstrate the value of using Drosophila for investigating iron trafficking and the evolution of systemic iron regulation.",2019,"Guiran Xiao, Zhi-Hua Liu, Mengran Zhao, Hui-Li Wang, Bing Zhou, Guiran Xiao, Zhi-Hua Liu, Mengran Zhao, Hui-Li Wang, Bing Zhou"
Phylogenetic incongruence in the Drosophila melanogaster species group,17071113,10.1016/j.ympev.2006.09.002,"Drosophila melanogaster and its close relatives are used extensively in comparative biology. Despite the importance of phylogenetic information for such studies, relationships between some melanogaster species group members are unclear due to conflicting phylogenetic signals at different loci. In this study, we use twelve nuclear loci (eleven coding and one non-coding) to assess the degree of phylogenetic incongruence in this model system. We focus on two nodes: (1) the node joining the Drosophila erecta-Drosophila orena, Drosophila melanogaster-Drosophila simulans, and Drosophila yakuba-Drosophila teissieri lineages, and (2) the node joining the lineages leading to the melanogaster, takahashii, and eugracilis subgroups. We find limited evidence for incongruence at the first node; our data, as well as those of several previous studies, strongly support monophyly of a clade consisting of D. erecta-D. orena and D. yakuba-D. teissieri. By contrast, using likelihood based tests of congruence, we find robust evidence for topological incongruence at the second node. Different loci support different relationships among the melanogaster, takahashii, and eugracilis subgroups, and the observed incongruence is not easily attributable to homoplasy, non-equilibrium base composition, or positive selection on a subset of loci. We argue that lineage sorting in the common ancestor of these three subgroups is the most plausible explanation for our observations. Such lineage sorting may lead to biased estimation of tree topology and evolutionary rates, and may confound inferences of positive selection.",2007,"Alex Wong, Jeffrey D Jensen, John E Pool, Charles F Aquadro, Alex Wong, Jeffrey D Jensen, John E Pool, Charles F Aquadro"

Acute and chronic toxicity effects of silver nanoparticles (NPs) on Drosophila melanogaster,21553866,10.1021/es104216b,"The use of nanoscaled materials is rapidly increasing, however, their possible ecotoxicological effects are still not precisely known. This work constitutes the first complex study focused on in vivo evaluation of the acute and chronic toxic effects and toxic limits of silver nanoparticles (NPs) on the eukaryotic organism Drosophila melanogaster. For the purpose of this study, silver NPs were prepared in the form of solid dispersion using microencapsulation method, where mannitol was used as an encapsulation agent. This newly prepared solid dispersion with a high concentration of silver NPs was exploited to prepare the standard Drosophila culture medium at a silver concentration range from 10 mg·L(-1) to 100 mg·L(-1) of Ag in the case of the acute toxicity testing and at a concentration equal to 5 mg·L(-1) in the case of the chronic toxicity testing. The acute toxic effect of silver NPs on Drosophila melanogaster was observed for the silver concentration equal to 20 mg·L(-1). At this silver concentration, 50% of the tested flies were unable to leave the pupae, and they did not finish their developmental cycle. Chronic toxicity of silver NPs was assessed by a long-term exposure of overall eight filial generations of Drosophila melanogaster to silver NPs. The long-term exposure to silver NPs influenced the fertility of Drosophila during the first three filial generations, nevertheless the fecundity of flies in subsequent generations consequently increased up to the level of the flies from the control sample due to the adaptability of flies to the silver NPs exposure.",2011,"Ales Panacek, Robert Prucek, Dana Safarova, Milan Dittrich, Jana Richtrova, Katerina Benickova, Radek Zboril, Libor Kvitek, Ales Panacek, Robert Prucek, Dana Safarova, Milan Dittrich, Jana Richtrova, Katerina Benickova, Radek Zboril, Libor Kvitek"
Accelerated sequence divergence of conserved genomic elements in Drosophila melanogaster,18583644,10.1101/gr.077131.108,"Recent genomic sequencing of 10 additional Drosophila genomes provides a rich resource for comparative genomics analyses aimed at understanding the similarities and differences between species and between Drosophila and mammals. Using a phylogenetic approach, we identified 64 genomic elements that have been highly conserved over most of the Drosophila tree, but that have experienced a recent burst of evolution along the Drosophila melanogaster lineage. Compared to similarly defined elements in humans, these regions of rapid lineage-specific evolution in Drosophila differ dramatically in location, mechanism of evolution, and functional properties of associated genes. Notably, the majority reside in protein-coding regions and primarily result from rapid adaptive synonymous site evolution. In fact, adaptive evolution appears to be driving substitutions to unpreferred codons. Our analysis also highlights interesting noncoding genomic regions, such as regulatory regions in the gene gooseberry-neuro and a putative novel miRNA.",2008,"Alisha K Holloway, David J Begun, Adam Siepel, Katherine S Pollard, Alisha K Holloway, David J Begun, Adam Siepel, Katherine S Pollard"
Using Drosophila melanogaster to uncover human disease gene function and potential drug target proteins,12223075,10.1517/14728222.6.3.387,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful genetic model organism, which has been instrumental in the determination of essential developmental and neurological pathways conserved from invertebrates to humans. With the completion of both the human and Drosophila genomes, the revelation that we are more similar to this simple organism than previously suspected was realised. 75% of human genetic disease genes have clear homologues in the fly. By utilising an array of genetic tools available to disrupt or misexpress these proteins, it is now feasible to perform large-scale genetic screens in Drosophila to identify other members of a particular human genetic pathway. This review outlines some of the reasons Drosophila is a useful tool for the discovery of therapeutic targets, covers some of the tools available to manipulate this organism and discusses specific examples of how to use Drosophila as a genetic test tube for revealing proteins which act in a common pathway.",2002,"Lawrence T Reiter, Ethan Bier, Lawrence T Reiter, Ethan Bier"
A calpain-like activity insensitive to calpastatin in Drosophila melanogaster,11985896,10.1016/s0304-4165(02)00184-8,"Calpains are neutral Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteases. In this study, we utilized casein zymography to detect such a proteolytic activity in Drosophila melanogaster extracts throughout the life of this organism. One calpain-like activity that was sensitive to the general cysteine protease inhibitors, E64 and calpain inhibitor I, but insensitive to the human calpain-specific inhibitor, calpastatin, is demonstrated. The relevance of this finding is discussed with respect to the absence of a corresponding Drosophila gene, homologous to the vertebrate calpastatin genes, as concluded from our unsuccessful attempts to clone such a gene and our Blast searches using the FlyBase. The mechanisms of Drosophila calpain regulation require further investigation. However, we suggest that single chain, non-heterodimeric calpains may be insensitive to calpastatin and that Drosophila cystatin-like molecules may play a role in negatively regulating Drosophila calpain.",2002,"Monique Laval, Martial Pascal, Monique Laval, Martial Pascal"
Rapid sequence divergence in a heat shock locus of Drosophila,6160024,10.1007/BF00285953,"In situ hybridization of cRNA transcribed from cloned D. melanogaster heat shock sequences to D. hydei chromosomes has shown that the D. hydei locus 2--32 A corresponds to the D. melanogaster locus 87 A/C and the D. hydei locus 2--36 A to the D. melanogaster locus 95 D, while the D. hydei locus 4--81 B corresponds to the D. melanogaster locus 63 BC. No hybridization to D. hydei chromosomes was found with cRNA transcribed from a clone containing the alpha beta sequences encoded by the D. melanogaster locus 87 C. Neither D. melanogaster heat shock RNA nor D virilis heat shock RNA hybridized significantly to the D. hydei heat shock locus 2--48 B. Furthermore, D. hydei heat shock RNA did not hybridize to the cytological homologs of locus 2--48 B found in D. repleta or in D. virilis. D. hydei heat shock.

Development and testing of a novel killer-rescue self-limiting gene drive system in Drosophila melanogaster,32292114,10.1098/rspb.2019.2994,"Here we report the development and testing of a novel self-limiting gene drive system, Killer-Rescue (K-R), in Drosophila melanogaster. This system is composed of an autoregulated Gal4 Killer (K) and a Gal4-activated Gal80 Rescue (R). Overexpression of Gal4 is lethal, but in the presence of R activation of Gal80 leads to much lower levels of Gal4 and rescue of lethality. We demonstrate that with a single 2 : 1 engineered to wild-type release, K drives R through the population and after nine generations, more than 98% of the population carry R and less than 2% of the population are wild-type flies. We discuss how this simple K-R gene drive system may be readily adapted for population replacement in a human health pest, Aedes aegypti, or for population suppression in an agricultural pest, Drosophila suzukii.",2020,"Sophia H Webster, Michael R Vella, Maxwell J Scott, Sophia H Webster, Michael R Vella, Maxwell J Scott"
An Atlas of Transcription Factors Expressed in Male Pupal Terminalia of Drosophila melanogaster,31619460,10.1534/g3.119.400788,"During development, transcription factors and signaling molecules govern gene regulatory networks to direct the formation of unique morphologies. As changes in gene regulatory networks are often implicated in morphological evolution, mapping transcription factor landscapes is important, especially in tissues that undergo rapid evolutionary change. The terminalia (genital and anal structures) of Drosophila melanogaster and its close relatives exhibit dramatic changes in morphology between species. While previous studies have identified network components important for patterning the larval genital disc, the networks governing adult structures during pupal development have remained uncharted. Here, we performed RNA-seq in whole Drosophila melanogaster male terminalia followed by in situ hybridization for 100 highly expressed transcription factors during pupal development. We find that the male terminalia are highly patterned during pupal stages and that specific transcription factors mark separate structures and substructures. Our results are housed online in a searchable database (https://flyterminalia.pitt.edu/) as a resource for the community. This work lays a foundation for future investigations into the gene regulatory networks governing the development and evolution of Drosophila terminalia.",2019,"Ben J Vincent, Gavin R Rice, Gabriella M Wong, William J Glassford, Kayla I Downs, Jessica L Shastay, Kenechukwu Charles-Obi, Malini Natarajan, Madelaine Gogol, Julia Zeitlinger, Mark Rebeiz, Ben J Vincent, Gavin R Rice, Gabriella M Wong, William J Glassford, Kayla I Downs, Jessica L Shastay, Kenechukwu Charles-Obi, Malini Natarajan, Madelaine Gogol, Julia Zeitlinger, Mark Rebeiz"
Molecular cloning of DNA complementary to Drosophila melanogaster alpha-amylase mRNA,3038675,10.1139/g87-087,"Several lambda clones containing cDNAs from Drosophila melanogaster were identified in a lambda cDNA bank using two different approaches: (i) cross-species hybridization using a mouse amylase cDNA probe, and (ii) probing with a differential probe, generated from Drosophila RNA. An amylase cDNA fragment was used, in turn, for the isolation and characterization of amylase genomic clones. The size of the Drosophila amylase mRNA was estimated at 1650 b. This is comparable with the size of the murine amylase messenger that encodes a protein of similar molecular weight. In Drosophila larvae, amylase mRNA can account for as little as 0.01% of the poly(A)+ RNA under conditions of dietary glucose repression or greater than 1% of poly(A)+ RNA under derepressing dietary conditions.",1987,"B F Benkel, S Abukashawa, P H Boer, D A Hickey, B F Benkel, S Abukashawa, P H Boer, D A Hickey"
[Effect of sterol metabolism in the yeast-Drosophila system on the frequency of radiation-induced aneuploidy in Drosophila melanogaster oocytes],3930348,,"The influence of sterol metabolism upon mutagenesis in Drosophila melanogaster was investigated using ecological-genetic yeast - drosophila system. Sterol deficiency in the organism of Drosophila was caused by using the strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 9-2P712 with a mutation in the nysr1 locus which blocks synthesis of ergosterol as a nutrition substrate for flies. It was concluded that maintenance of females on the mutant yeast strain causes an increase of radiation-induced X-chromosome loss in mature oocytes.

Organization and mapping of a sequence on the Drosophila melanogaster X and Y chromosomes that is transcribed during spermatogenesis,6430749,,"The D. melanogaster DNA segment in the recombinant phage lambda Dm2L1 contains at least eight copies of a tandemly repeated 1250-base pair (bp) sequence (henceforth called the 2L1 sequence). Testes from XO D. melanogaster males contain an abundant 800-base RNA species that is homologous to a 520-bp region of the 2L1 sequence. Blotting experiments show that the 2L1 sequence is repeated in the D. melanogaster genome and is present on both the X and Y chromosomes. With the use of X-Y translocations, the 2L1 sequence has been mapped to a region between kl-1 and kl-2 on the long arm of the Y chromosome. In Oregon-R wild type there are an estimated 200 copies of the 2L1 sequence on the X chromosome and probably at least 80 copies of the Y chromosome. In some other strains the repetition frequency on the Y chromosome is about the same, but the copy number on the X chromosome is much reduced. On the basis of the five strains investigated, there is a correlation between copy number of the 2L1 sequence on the X chromosome and the presence of a particular allele of the Stellate locus (Ste; 1-45.7). It seems that low copy number corresponds to Ste+ and high copy number corresponds to Ste. The Ste locus determines whether single or star-shaped crystals are observed in the spermatocytes of XO males. Studies using D. simulans and D. mauritiana DNA show that the 2L1 sequence is homologous to restriction fragments in male DNA but not female DNA, indicating that this sequence is present only on the Y chromosome in these two species. In DNA derived from D. erecta, D. teissieri and D. yakuba, there is very little, if any, hybridization with the 2L1 sequence probe.",1984,"K J Livak, K J Livak"

Anandamide Metabolites Protect against Seizures through the TRP Channel Water Witch in Drosophila melanogaster,32492422,10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107710,"Endocannabinoids protect against seizures, but their mechanism of action is still unclear, as they can have effects independent of known cannabinoid receptors. Using Drosophila melanogaster, which lacks canonical cannabinoid receptors, we report that the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol protect against seizures in multiple fly seizure models. Surprisingly, inhibition of anandamide catabolism renders flies insensitive to protection by anandamide, indicating that anandamide metabolites are responsible for seizure protection. Consistent with this finding, arachidonic acid, a direct metabolite of anandamide, protects against seizures. To identify downstream effectors, we test for a role of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and find that the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine blocks the protective effect of anandamide. Also, a targeted genetic screen of TRP channels identifies water witch as a mediator of protection by anandamide. Using a Drosophila model, we reveal the role of arachidonic acid in seizure protection and identify a cannabinoid-receptor-1/2-independent mechanism of endocannabinoid seizure protection.",2020,"Jack A Jacobs, Amita Sehgal, Jack A Jacobs, Amita Sehgal"
Balancing selection on immunity genes: review of the current literature and new analysis in Drosophila melanogaster,27106015,10.1016/j.zool.2016.03.004,"Balancing selection has been widely assumed to be an important evolutionary force, yet even today little is known about its abundance and its impact on the patterns of genetic diversity. Several studies have shown examples of balancing selection in humans, plants or parasites, and many genes under balancing selection are involved in immunity. It has been proposed that host-parasite coevolution is one of the main forces driving immune genes to evolve under balancing selection. In this paper, we review the literature on balancing selection on immunity genes in several organisms, including Drosophila. Furthermore, we performed a genome scan for balancing selection in an African population of Drosophila melanogaster using coalescent simulations of a demographic model with and without selection. We find very few genes under balancing selection and only one novel candidate gene related to immunity. Finally, we discuss the possible causes of the low number of genes under balancing selection.",2016,"Myriam Croze, Daniel Živković, Wolfgang Stephan, Stephan Hutter, Myriam Croze, Daniel Živković, Wolfgang Stephan, Stephan Hutter"
"One, two, and many--a perspective on what groups of Drosophila melanogaster can tell us about social dynamics",22902126,10.1016/B978-0-12-387687-4.00003-9,"In the natural world, interactions between individuals occur in groups: an individual must recognize others, identify social opportunities, and discriminate among these options to engage in an interactive behavior. The presence of the group is known to exert an influence on individual group members, and this influence may feed back through the individual to affect behavior across the group. Such feedback has been observed in Drosophila melanogaster, for example, when mating frequency increases in groups composed of mixed strains compared to homogenous groups (Krupp et al., 2008 and Billeter et al. 2012). A working hypothesis is that social processes-to recognize, identify, discriminate, and engage-are innate. They rely on a combination of genetic inheritance, molecular interactions, and cell circuitry that produce neural and immunological responses. Here, we discuss studies that emphasize social interactions in four categories in Drosophila melanogaster: learning, circadian clocks, aggression, and mating. We also speculate that a systems-level network approach to the study of Drosophila groups will be instrumental in understanding the genetic basis of emergent group-level behavior.",2012,"Jonathan Schneider, Jade Atallah, Joel D Levine, Jonathan Schneider, Jade Atallah, Joel D Levine"
A correlation between DNA repair capacity and longevity in adult Drosophila melanogaster,8315215,10.1093/geronj/48.4.b124,"Mutagen-sensitive (mus) mutants in Drosophila melanogaster have been biochemically characterized as defective in DNA repair. Life spans of three temperature-sensitive mus strains have been measured to determine if loss of DNA repair capacity has a substantial influence on the longevity of adult Drosophila. The mus(ts) strains have been tested for an effect on longevity, with and without exposure to low doses of the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate. All three strains tested show substantially reduced life spans in the absence of the mutagen. The effect is seen at the restrictive temperature but not at the permissive temperature. In addition, the reduction in life span is enhanced by exposure to very low, sublethal doses of MMS during development. This effect is also temperature-sensitive. Temperature-shift studies indicate that it is mutagen-sensitivity during development that is leading to reduced longevity in adults. These results suggest that the integrity of DNA repair systems may play a role in the longevity of adult Drosophila melanogaster.",1993,"I Whitehead, T A Grigliatti, I Whitehead, T A Grigliatti"
Coiled coil domain-containing protein 56 (CCDC56) is a novel mitochondrial protein essential for cytochrome c oxidase function,22610097,10.1074/jbc.M112.343764,"In Drosophila melanogaster, the mitochondrial transcription factor B1 (d-mtTFB1) transcript contains in its 5'-untranslated region a conserved upstream open reading frame denoted as CG42630 in FlyBase. We demonstrate that CG42630 encodes a novel protein, the coiled coil domain-containing protein 56 (CCDC56), conserved in metazoans. We show that Drosophila CCDC56 protein localizes to mitochondria and contains 87 amino acids in flies and 106 in humans with the two proteins sharing 42% amino acid identity. We show by rapid amplification of cDNA ends and Northern blotting that Drosophila CCDC56 protein and mtTFB1 are encoded on a bona fide bicistronic transcript. We report the generation and characterization of two ccdc56 knock-out lines in Drosophila carrying the ccdc56(D6) and ccdc56(D11) alleles. Lack of the CCDC56 protein in flies induces a developmental delay and 100% lethality by arrest of larval development at the third instar. ccdc56 knock-out larvae show a significant decrease in the level of fully assembled cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and in its activity, suggesting a defect in complex assembly; the activity of the other oxidative phosphorylation complexes remained either unaffected or increased in the ccdc56 knock-out larvae. The lethal phenotype and the decrease in COX were partially rescued by reintroduction of a wild-type UAS-ccdc56 transgene. These results indicate an important role for CCDC56 in the oxidative phosphorylation system and in particular in COX function required for proper development in D. melanogaster. We propose CCDC56 as a candidate factor required for COX biogenesis/assembly.",2012,"Susana Peralta, Paula Clemente, Alvaro Sánchez-Martínez, Manuel Calleja, Rosana Hernández-Sierra, Yuichi Matsushima, Cristina Adán, Cristina Ugalde, Miguel Ángel Fernández-Moreno, Laurie S Kaguni, Rafael Garesse, Susana Peralta, Paula Clemente, Alvaro Sánchez-Martínez, Manuel Calleja, Rosana Hernández-Sierra, Yuichi Matsushima, Cristina Adán, Cristina Ugalde, Miguel Ángel Fernández-Moreno, Laurie S Kaguni, Rafael Garesse"
An integrated gene annotation and transcriptional profiling approach towards the full gene content of the Drosophila genome,14709175,10.1186/gb-2003-5-1-r3,"Background:
      
    

    
      While the genome sequences for a variety of organisms are now available, the precise number of the genes encoded is still a matter of debate. For the human genome several stringent annotation approaches have resulted in the same number of potential genes, but a careful comparison revealed only limited overlap. This indicates that only the combination of different computational prediction methods and experimental evaluation of such in silico data will provide more complete genome annotations. In order to get a more complete gene content of the Drosophila melanogaster genome, we based our new D. melanogaster whole-transcriptome microarray, the Heidelberg FlyArray, on the combination of the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) annotation and a novel ab initio gene prediction of lower stringency using the Fgenesh software.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here we provide evidence for the transcription of approximately 2,600 additional genes predicted by Fgenesh. Validation of the developmental profiling data by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization indicates a lower limit of 2,000 novel annotations, thus substantially raising the number of genes that make a fly.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The successful design and application of this novel Drosophila microarray on the basis of our integrated in silico/wet biology approach confirms our expectation that in silico approaches alone will always tend to be incomplete. The identification of at least 2,000 novel genes highlights the importance of gathering experimental evidence to discover all genes within a genome. Moreover, as such an approach is independent of homology criteria, it will allow the discovery of novel genes unrelated to known protein families or those that have not been strictly conserved between species.",2003,"M Hild, B Beckmann, S A Haas, B Koch, V Solovyev, C Busold, K Fellenberg, M Boutros, M Vingron, F Sauer, J D Hoheisel, R Paro, M Hild, B Beckmann, S A Haas, B Koch, V Solovyev, C Busold, K Fellenberg, M Boutros, M Vingron, F Sauer, J D Hoheisel, R Paro"
Multiple cis-acting sequences contribute to evolved regulatory variation for Drosophila Adh genes,1644276,,"Drosophila affinidisjuncta and Drosophila hawaiiensis are closely related species that display distinct tissue-specific expression patterns for their homologous alcohol dehydrogenase genes (Adh genes). In Drosophila melanogaster transformants, both genes are expressed at high levels in the larval and adult fat bodies, but the D. affinidisjuncta gene is expressed 10-50-fold more strongly in the larval and adult midguts and Malpighian tubules. The present study reports the mapping of cis-acting sequences contributing to the regulatory differences between these two genes in transformants. Chimeric genes were constructed and introduced into the germ line of D. melanogaster. Stage- and tissue-specific expression patterns were determined by measuring steady-state RNA levels in larvae and adults. Three portions of the promoter region make distinct contributions to the tissue-specific regulatory differences between the native genes. Sequences immediately upstream of the distal promoter have a strong effect in the adult Malpighian tubules, while sequences between the two promoters are relatively important in the larval Malpighian tubules. A third gene segment, immediately upstream of the proximal promoter, influences levels of the proximal Adh transcript in all tissues and developmental stages examined, and largely accounts for the regulatory difference in the larval and adult midguts. However, these as well as other sequences make smaller contributions to various aspects of the tissue-specific regulatory differences. In addition, some chimeric genes display aberrant RNA levels for the whole organism, suggesting close physical association between sequences involved in tissue-specific regulatory differences and those important for Adh expression in the larval and adult fat bodies.",1992,"X M Fang, M D Brennan, X M Fang, M D Brennan"
Drosophila melanogaster as a model to characterize fungal volatile organic compounds,23139201,10.1002/tox.21825,"Fungi are implicated in poor indoor air quality and may pose a potential risk factor for building/mold related illnesses. Fungi emit numerous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as alcohols, esters, ethers, ketones, aldehydes, terpenoids, thiols, and their derivatives. The toxicity profile of these VOCs has never been explored in a model organism, which could enable the performance of high throughput toxicological assays and lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of toxicity. We have established a reductionist Drosophila melanogaster model to evaluate the toxicity of fungal VOCs. In this report, we assessed the toxicity of fungal VOCs emitted from living cultures of species in the genera, Trichoderma, Aspergillus, and Penicillium and observed a detrimental effect on larval survival. We then used chemical standards of selected fungal VOCs to assess their toxicity on larval and adult Drosophila. We compared the survival of adult flies exposed to these fungal VOCs with known industrial toxic chemicals (formaldehyde [37%], xylene, benzene, and toluene). Among the tested fungal VOC standards, the compounds with eight carbons (C8) caused greater truncation of fly lifespan than tested non-C8 fungal VOCs and industrial toxins. Our data validate the use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model with the potential to elucidate the mechanistic attributes of different toxic VOCs emitted by fungi and also to explore the potential link between reported human illnesses/symptoms and exposure to water damaged and mold contaminated buildings.",2014,"Arati A Inamdar, Taslim Zaman, Shannon U Morath, David C Pu, Joan W Bennett, Arati A Inamdar, Taslim Zaman, Shannon U Morath, David C Pu, Joan W Bennett"

That esterase 6 may be involved in a system controlling the timing of remating is suggested by differences in the activity of this enzyme in a strain of Drosophila selected for a decrease in time to remating and by differences in the timing of remating in females initially inseminated by males lacking or having active esterase 6.,1980,"R C Richmond, D G Gilbert, K B Sheehan, M H Gromko, F M Butterworth, R C Richmond, D G Gilbert, K B Sheehan, M H Gromko, F M Butterworth"
Behavior genetics of olfactory responses in Drosophila. II. An odorant-specific variant in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster,104703,10.1007/BF01067937,"Homozygous second chromosome lines were extracted from a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster and tested for their olfactory responses to ethyl acetate. The chromosome lines were highly heterogeneous for this behavior, and the variability was also specific to other esters and ketones such as ethyl propionate, 2-butanone, 2-pentanone, and 3-pentanone. The responses to these odorants negatively correlated with the response to another odorant, lactic acid. A large part of this odorant-specific variation seemed to be controlled by genes located on the right arm of the second chromosome.",1978,"Y Fuyama, Y Fuyama"
Body-weight and chromosome aberrations induced by X-rays in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,822274,10.1007/BF00267976,"Body-weight has been shown to influence the final expression of genetic damage by X-rays in Drosophila melanogaster. If larvae of Drosophila were raised up to the third instar in media containing different amounts of the same nutrient and in different conditions of crowding a positive correlation was observed between body-weight and frequency of chromosome aberrations induced by a given dose of X-rays in the somatic cells of their nerve ganglia. This effect, present in both sexes, is most plausibly attributed to a different capacity of big and small larvae for repairing radiation damage.",1976,"A De Marco, M P Belloni, A De Marco, M P Belloni"
Enterococci Mediate the Oviposition Preference of Drosophila melanogaster through Sucrose Catabolism,29044155,10.1038/s41598-017-13705-5,"Sucrose, one of the main products of photosynthesis in plants, functions as a universal biomarker for nutritional content and maturity of different fruits across diverse ecological niches. Drosophila melanogaster congregates to lay eggs in rotting fruits, yet the factors that influence these decisions remains uncovered. Here, we report that lactic acid bacteria Enterococci are critical modulators to attract Drosophila to lay eggs on decaying food. Drosophila-associated Enterococci predominantly catabolize sucrose for growing their population in fly food, and thus generate a unique ecological niche with depleted sucrose, but enriched bacteria. Female flies navigate these favorable oviposition sites by probing the sucrose cue with their gustatory sensory neurons. Acquirement of indigenous microbiota facilitated the development and systemic growth of Drosophila, thereby benefiting the survival and fitness of their offspring. Thus, our finding highlights the pivotal roles of commensal bacteria in influencing host behavior, opening the door to a better understanding of the ecological relationships between the microbial and metazoan worlds.",2017,"Wei Liu, Ke Zhang, Yujuan Li, Wanzhen Su, Kunkun Hu, Shan Jin, Wei Liu, Ke Zhang, Yujuan Li, Wanzhen Su, Kunkun Hu, Shan Jin"

In the present study, we reported that miR-11 regulates pupal size during Drosophila metamorphosis via targeting Ras85D with the following evidences: pupal size was increased in the miR-11 deletion mutant; restoration of miR-11 in the miR-11 deletion mutant rescued the increased pupal size phenotype observed in the miR-11 deletion mutant; ectopic expression of miR-11 in brain insulin-producing cells (IPCs) and whole body shows consistent alteration of pupal size; Dilps and Ras85D expressions were negatively regulated by miR-11 in vivo; miR-11 targets Ras85D through directly binding to Ras85D 3'-untranslated region in vitro; removal of one copy of Ras85D in the miR-11 deletion mutant rescued the increased pupal size phenotype observed in the miR-11 deletion mutant.

Imaging clathrin dynamics in Drosophila melanogaster hemocytes reveals a role for actin in vesicle fission,17014698,10.1111/j.1600-0854.2006.00492.x,"Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is essential for maintaining many basic cellular processes. We monitored the dynamics of clathrin in live Drosophila melanogaster hemocytes overexpressing clathrin light chain fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) using evanescent wave microscopy. Membrane-associated clathrin-coated structures (CCS) constitutively appeared at the peripheral filopodial membrane, moved centripetally while growing in intensity, before being eventually endocytosed within a few tens of seconds. This directed CCS traffic was independent of microtubules but could be blocked by latrunculin A. Taking advantage of available mutants of Drosophila, we expressed clathrin-EGFP in wasp and shibire mutant backgrounds to study the role of actin and dynamin in CCS dynamics and CME in hemocytes. We show that actin plays an essential role in CME in these cells, and that actin and dynamin act at the same stage, but independent of each other. Drosophila melanogaster hemocytes proved to be a promising model system to uncover the molecular events during CME in combining live-cell imaging and genetic analysis.",2006,"Olexiy Kochubey, Amitabha Majumdar, Jurgen Klingauf, Olexiy Kochubey, Amitabha Majumdar, Jurgen Klingauf"
Nomadic enhancers: tissue-specific cis-regulatory elements of yellow have divergent genomic positions among Drosophila species,21151964,10.1371/journal.pgen.1001222,"cis-regulatory DNA sequences known as enhancers control gene expression in space and time. They are central to metazoan development and are often responsible for changes in gene regulation that contribute to phenotypic evolution. Here, we examine the sequence, function, and genomic location of enhancers controlling tissue- and cell-type specific expression of the yellow gene in six Drosophila species. yellow is required for the production of dark pigment, and its expression has evolved largely in concert with divergent pigment patterns. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a transgenic host, we examined the expression of reporter genes in which either 5' intergenic or intronic sequences of yellow from each species controlled the expression of Green Fluorescent Protein. Surprisingly, we found that sequences controlling expression in the wing veins, as well as sequences controlling expression in epidermal cells of the abdomen, thorax, and wing, were located in different genomic regions in different species. By contrast, sequences controlling expression in bristle-associated cells were located in the intron of all species. Differences in the precise pattern of spatial expression within the developing epidermis of D. melanogaster transformants usually correlated with adult pigmentation in the species from which the cis-regulatory sequences were derived, which is consistent with cis-regulatory evolution affecting yellow expression playing a central role in Drosophila pigmentation divergence. Sequence comparisons among species favored a model in which sequential nucleotide substitutions were responsible for the observed changes in cis-regulatory architecture. Taken together, these data demonstrate frequent changes in yellow cis-regulatory architecture among Drosophila species. Similar analyses of other genes, combining in vivo functional tests of enhancer activity with in silico comparative genomics, are needed to determine whether the pattern of regulatory evolution we observed for yellow is characteristic of genes with rapidly evolving expression patterns.",2010,"Gizem Kalay, Patricia J Wittkopp, Gizem Kalay, Patricia J Wittkopp"
Leveraging genomic databases: from an Aedes albopictus mosquito cell line to the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae via the Drosophila genome project,11966884,10.1046/j.1365-2583.2002.00324.x,"An important justification for genome sequencing efforts is the anticipation that data from model organisms will provide a framework for the more rapid analysis of other, less studied genomes. In this investigation, we sequenced an internal region of 25 amino acids from a 52 kDa protein that was differentially expressed in 20-hydroxyecdysone-treated Aedes albopictus cells in culture. Within the GenBank non-mouse and non-human expressed sequence tag (EST) database, this ""Aedes peptide"" uncovered a putative homology to hypothetical translation products from Anopheles gambiae, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. The hypothetical translation product from D. melanogaster, which included 462 amino acids, uncovered five expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae. When the Anopheles ESTs were aligned against the hypothetical Drosophila protein, we found that in aggregate they covered 324 amino acids, with gaps measuring 19, 30, and 87 amino acids. To approximate the complete amino acid sequence, gaps between translation products from Anopheles ESTs were replaced with corresponding amino acids from Drosophila to arrive at a calculated mass of 51 104 and a pI of 5.84 for the mosquito protein, consistent with the position of the Ae. albopictus protein on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels. Finally, tandem mass spectrometry of a tryptic digest of the 52 kDa Ae. albopictus protein revealed 33 peptides with masses within 1 Dalton of those predicted from an in silico digestion of the reconstructed Anophleles protein. In addition to providing the first direct evidence that a hypothetical protein in Drosophila is in fact translated, this analysis provides a general approach for maximizing recovery, from existing databases, of information that can facilitate prioritization of efforts among several candidate proteins.",2002,"E D Eccleston, Anna Gerenday, Ann M Fallon, E D Eccleston, Anna Gerenday, Ann M Fallon"

The two rate constants for this kinetic system were estimated from mating data using a wild-type D. simulans strain, a wild-type D. melanogaster strain, and vestigial mutant D. melanogaster males with wild-type females. The results confirm the applicability of second order kinetics, and demonstrate the usefulness of the model in comparisons of mating rates among strains of flies.

Chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depressive-like behavior and dysregulation of brain levels of biogenic amines in Drosophila melanogaster,29803654,10.1016/j.bbr.2018.05.016,"The etiopathogenesis of depression may involve repeated exposure to several unpredictable stressors. This study was conducted to investigate changes induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and to assess behavioral and neurochemical changes that predict depressive-like behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. Male Drosophila melanogaster flies were exposed to CUMS with several stressors (cold, heat, starvation, and sleep deprivation) in an unpredictable and chronic manner for ten days. At the end of treatment, in vivo behavioral tests (open field, aggression, forced swimming, mating, light/dark box, male fertility evaluation, sucrose preference, weight evaluation) and ex vivo analyses (dopamine and serotonin levels) were performed. Using this CUMS model, we obtained results that contribute to the construction of a depressive model in Drosophila, where we reproduce some behavioral phenotypes corresponding to depressive symptoms, such as immobility in the forced swimming test, less exploration in the light/dark test, changes in mating behavior, changes in the aggressiveness test, reduced sucrose preference, and weight-loss, in addition to a significant reduction in the levels of serotonin and dopamine when compared to the control group. Fluoxetine was used in our study as a positive control to demonstrate that CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviors in flies can be reversed by antidepressants. In conclusion, male Drosophila melanogaster exposed to CUMS display a depressive-like phenotype, and, while this poses some limitations as an animal model for depression, it meets some of the criteria required to be a valid model, such as good face and construct validity.",2018,"Stífani Machado Araujo, Marcia Rósula Poetini, Vandreza Cardoso Bortolotto, Shanda de Freitas Couto, Franciane Cabral Pinheiro, Luana Barreto Meichtry, Francielli Polet de Almeida, Elize Aparecida Santos Musachio, Mariane Trindade de Paula, Marina Prigol, Stífani Machado Araujo, Marcia Rósula Poetini, Vandreza Cardoso Bortolotto, Shanda de Freitas Couto, Franciane Cabral Pinheiro, Luana Barreto Meichtry, Francielli Polet de Almeida, Elize Aparecida Santos Musachio, Mariane Trindade de Paula, Marina Prigol"

Using a modified version of a recently described method (FIMTrack) to assess several parameters in larger sets of animals, we initially detected specific differences in larval food searching when comparing Drosophila strains. These differences were further influenced by the presence of nematodes. Given a choice, Drosophila larvae clearly avoided nematodes irrespective of their genetic background.

Function of the wingless signaling pathway in Drosophila,19109707,10.1007/978-1-60327-469-2_10,"Signaling by the wingless pathway has been shown to govern numerous developmental processes. Much of our current understanding of wingless signaling mechanisms comes from studies conducted in Drosophila melanogaster, which offers superior experimental tractability for genetic and developmental studies. Wingless signaling is highly consequential during normal development and patterning of Drosophila. Its earliest identifiable role during development of Drosophila is in the embryonic segmentation cascade, wherein wingless functions as a segment polarity gene and serves to pattern each individual segment along the antero-posterior axis of the developing embryo. Subsequent developmental roles fulfilled by wingless include patterning the developing wings, legs, eyes, CNS, heart, and muscles. Each of these developmental contexts offers excellent systems to query mechanisms regulating different aspects of wingless signal transduction such as synthesis, secretion, reception, and transcription. This chapter presents a brief overview on the functions of wingless signaling during development of Drosophila melanogaster.",2008,"Foster C Gonsalves, Ramanuj DasGupta, Foster C Gonsalves, Ramanuj DasGupta"
Purification and characterization of diaphorases from some Drosophila species,1616484,10.1007/BF02396219,"Diaphorase-1 and diaphorase-2 were isolated from two Drosophila species, D. virilis and D. melanogaster, and purified by gel filtration, affinity chromatography, immunoaffinity chromatography, and ion-exchange chromatography. The molecular weights of both enzymes were the same in each species. The molecular weight of diaphorase-1 was the same under both denaturating and nondenaturating conditions, close to 60,000, indicating a monomeric structure. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) electrophoresis of the purified diaphorase-2 revealed the presence of a single protein band of 55,000 Da, while the molecular weight of the native enzyme was found to be 67,000. The two diaphorases were further characterized by their pH optima, isoelectric points, and kinetic parameters, and antibodies were raised in rabbits against the purified enzymes from D. virilis.

Microbial community assembly in wild populations of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,29358735,10.1038/s41396-017-0020-x,"Animals are routinely colonized by microorganisms. Despite many studies documenting the microbial taxa associated with animals, the pattern and ecological determinants of among-animal variation in microbial communities are poorly understood. This study quantified the bacterial communities associated with natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. Across five collections, each fly bore 16-78 OTUs, predominantly of the Acetobacteraceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae. Positive relationships, mostly among related OTUs, dominated both the significant co-occurrences and co-association networks among bacteria, and OTUs with important network positions were generally of intermediate abundance and prevalence. The prevalence of most OTUs was well predicted by a neutral model suggesting that ecological drift and passive dispersal contribute significantly to microbiome composition. However, some Acetobacteraceae and Lactobacillaceae were present in more flies than predicted, indicative of superior among-fly dispersal. These taxa may be well-adapted to the Drosophila habitat from the perspective of dispersal as the principal benefit of the association to the microbial partners. Taken together, these patterns indicate that both stochastic processes and deterministic processes relating to the differential capacity for persistence in the host habitat and transmission between hosts contribute to bacterial community assembly in Drosophila melanogaster.",2018,"Karen L Adair, Marita Wilson, Alyssa Bost, Angela E Douglas, Karen L Adair, Marita Wilson, Alyssa Bost, Angela E Douglas"
The Drosophila melanogaster homolog of UBE3A is not imprinted in neurons,27599063,10.1080/15592294.2016.1214783,"In mammals, expression of UBE3A is epigenetically regulated in neurons and expression is restricted to the maternal copy of UBE3A. A recent report claimed that Drosophila melanogaster UBE3A homolog (Dube3a) is preferentially expressed from the maternal allele in fly brain, inferring an imprinting mechanism. However, complex epigenetic regulatory features of the mammalian imprinting center are not present in Drosophila, and allele specific expression of Dube3a has not been documented. We used behavioral and electrophysiological analysis of the Dube3a loss-of-function allele (Dube3a15b) to investigate Dube3a imprinting in fly neurons. We found that motor impairment (climbing ability) and a newly-characterized defect in synaptic transmission are independent of parental inheritance of the Dube3a15b allele. Furthermore, expression analysis of coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Dube3a did not reveal allele specific expression differences among reciprocal crosses. These data indicate that Dube3a is neither imprinted nor preferentially expressed from the maternal allele in fly neurons.",2016,"Kevin A Hope, Mark S LeDoux, Lawrence T Reiter, Kevin A Hope, Mark S LeDoux, Lawrence T Reiter"
Functional analysis of eve stripe 2 enhancer evolution in Drosophila: rules governing conservation and change,9449677,,"Experimental investigations of eukaryotic enhancers suggest that multiple binding sites and trans-acting regulatory factors are often required for wild-type enhancer function. Genetic analysis of the stripe 2 enhancer of even-skipped (eve), an important developmental gene in Drosophila, provides support for this view. Given the importance of even-skipped expression in early Drosophila development, it might be predicted that many structural features of the stripe 2 enhancer will be evolutionarily conserved, including the DNA sequences of protein binding sites and the spacing between them. To test this hypothesis, we compared sequences of the stripe 2 enhancer between four species of Drosophila: D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. erecta and D. pseudoobscura. Our analysis revealed a large number of nucleotide substitutions in regulatory protein binding sites for bicoid, hunchback, Kruppel and giant, as well as a systematic change in the size of the enhancer. Some of the binding sites in D. melanogaster are either absent or modified in other species. One functionally important bicoid-binding site in D. melanogaster appears to be recently evolved. We, therefore, investigated possible functional consequences of sequence differences among these stripe 2 enhancers by P-element-mediated transformation. This analysis revealed that the eve stripe 2 enhancer from each of the four species drove reporter gene expression at the identical time and location in D. melanogaster embryos. Double staining of native eve protein and transgene mRNA in early embryos showed that the reporter gene mimicked native eve expression and, in every case, produced sharply defined stripes at the blastoderm stage that were coincident with eve stripe 2 protein. We argue that stripe 2 eve expression in Drosophila evolution can be viewed as being under constant stabilizing selection with respect to the location of the anterior and posterior borders of the stripe. We further hypothesize that the stripe 2 enhancer is functionally robust, so that its evolution may be governed by the fixation of both slightly deleterious and adaptive mutations in regulatory protein binding sites as well as in the spacing between binding sites. This view allows for a slow but continual turnover of functionally important changes in the stripe 2 enhancer.",1998,"M Z Ludwig, N H Patel, M Kreitman, M Z Ludwig, N H Patel, M Kreitman"

Transposable elements behavior following viral genomic stress in Drosophila melanogaster inbred line,8660425,10.1007/BF02352295,"To analyze the behavior of endogenous transposable elements under genomic stress, a Drosophila melanogaster inbred line was submitted to three kinds of viral perturbations. First, a retroviral plasmid containing the avian Rous Associated Virus type 2 (RAV-2) previously deleted for the viral envelope coding gene (env) was introduced by P element transformation into the Drosophila genome. An insertion of this avian retroviral sequence was detected by in situ hybridization in site 53C on polytene chromosome arm 2R. Second, Drosophila embryos were injected with RAV-2 particles produced by cell culture after transfection with the retroviral plasmid. Third, the Drosophila melanogaster inbred line was stably infected by the sigma native virus. It appears that neither the offspring of the flies in which the viral DNA was found integrated nor those from the infected sigma flies showed copia or mdg1 element mobilization. Injection of the avian RAV-2 particles led, however, to the observation of somatic transpositions of mdg1 element on the 2L chromosome, the copia element insertion pattern remaining stable. Thus, endogenous transposable elements show more instability in sublines injected with exogenous viral particles than in a transgenic subline containing a foreign viral insert, all transposable elements not being equally sensitive to such genomic stress.",1996,"I Jouan-Dufournel, F L Cosset, D Contamine, G Verdier, C Biémont, I Jouan-Dufournel, F L Cosset, D Contamine, G Verdier, C Biémont"

Exposure to bisphenol A affects lipid metabolism in Drosophila melanogaster,24215246,10.1111/bcpt.12170,"Exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) in rodents was shown to induce obesity, yet the mechanism by which BPA might induce obesity is still unclear. We employed the genetically tractable model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, to test the effects of raising them on food containing various concentrations of BPA. Of note, raising males on food containing BPA were susceptible to starvation, possibly by inhibiting their ability to perform lipolysis during starvation, leading to significantly increased lipid content after 24 hr of fasting. Furthermore, feeding males with BPA significantly inhibited the expression of insulin-like peptides. From these results, we conclude that BPA may inhibit lipid recruitment during starvation in Drosophila.",2014,"Michael J Williams, Yi Wang, Anica Klockars, P Monica Lind, Robert Fredriksson, Helgi B Schiöth, Michael J Williams, Yi Wang, Anica Klockars, P Monica Lind, Robert Fredriksson, Helgi B Schiöth"
Protein polymorphism is negatively correlated with conservation of intronic sequences and complexity of expression patterns in Drosophila melanogaster,17460807,10.1007/s00239-006-0047-5,"We report a significant negative correlation between nonsynonymous polymorphism and intron length in Drosophila melanogaster. This correlation is similar to that between protein divergence and intron length previously reported in Drosophila. We show that the relationship can be explained by the content of conserved noncoding sequences (CNS) within introns. In addition, genes with a high regulatory complexity and many genetic interactions also exhibit larger amounts of CNS within their introns and lower values of nonsynonymous polymorphism. The present study provides relevant evidence on the importance of intron content and expression patterns on the levels of coding polymorphism.",2007,"Natalia Petit, Sònia Casillas, Alfredo Ruiz, Antonio Barbadilla, Natalia Petit, Sònia Casillas, Alfredo Ruiz, Antonio Barbadilla"
[Recombination in Drosophila melanogaster males exposed at a thermoelectric power plant],9162685,,"For four years, genetic recombination was studied in Drosophila melanogaster males kept at a thermoelectric power station (TPS) in Moscow; a TPS located in another city district was taken for comparison in 1994. It was found that, in the experimental males, recombination frequency was two- to threefold higher than in the control flies. Temporal variations in recombination frequency during four years were not statistically significant. The data obtained at the two TPSs also did not significantly differ from each other. The considerable increase of the recombination frequency in Drosophila kept at the TPS may be considered an appropriate response to exposure to effective mutagens that were abundant in the TPS discharges.",1997,"L P Filatova, N Sh Lapteva, V A Shevchenko, L P Filatova, N Sh Lapteva, V A Shevchenko"
[Genetic phenomena during early cleavage divisions in Drosophila melanogaster],8964459,,"Published data on the pattern and genetic control of early cleavage divisions in Drosophila melanogaster are summarized. Data on chromosome elimination induced by the mutation paternal loss (pal), elimination of ring and rod chromosomes, and mitotic exchanges in the hyperploid pronucleus in Drosophila suggest a specific structural role of heterochromatic chromosomal regions during early cleavage. Mutations disturbing early cleavage divisions include mutations with effects assigned to different stages of this process. This allows us to suggest the existence of isofunctional proteins involved in mitosis and alternating during early cleavage. In addition, cleavage divisions apparently include a special mechanism preserving primordia of germ tissue from unbalanced nuclei.",1996,"L V Omel'ianchuk, L V Omel'ianchuk"
The radioimmune assay of ecdysteroid titres in Drosophila melanogaster,6783464,10.1016/0303-7207(81)90013-7,"The use of radioimmune assays to determine ecdysteroid titres during insect development has become widespread in recent years. In this review I consider the application of these assays to studies on the development of Drosophila melanogaster. In all, 8 studies have been undertaken with somewhat conflicting results. I discuss the underlying problems in these studies and relate them to studies in Calliphora and Manduca. I also consider evidence from in vitro studies of Drosophila tissues regarding the levels of circulating, biologically active, ecdysteroids and argue that the fluctuations so far described are not sufficient to explain the control functions ascribed to ecdysteroids in many developmental processes.",1981,"G Richards, G Richards"

For wing traits, heritabilities were relatively lower in the stressful environment, while heritabilities for bristle traits were not influenced by conditions.

Convergent evolution of a reproductive trait through distinct developmental mechanisms in Drosophila,23022298,10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.09.014,"Convergent morphologies often arise due to similar selective pressures in independent lineages. It is poorly understood whether the same or different developmental genetic mechanisms underlie such convergence. Here we show that independent evolution of a reproductive trait, ovariole number, has resulted from changes in distinct developmental mechanisms, each of which may have a different underlying genetic basis in Drosophila. Ovariole number in Drosophila is species-specific, highly variable, and largely under genetic control. Convergent changes in Drosophila ovariole number have evolved independently within and between species. We previously showed that the number of a specific ovarian cell type, terminal filament (TF) cells, determines ovariole number. Here we examine TF cell development in different Drosophila lineages that independently evolved a significantly lower ovariole number than the D. melanogaster Oregon R strain. We show that in these Drosophila lineages, reduction in ovariole number occurs primarily through variations in one of two different developmental mechanisms: (1) reduced number of somatic gonad precursors (SGP cells) specified during embryogenesis; or (2) alterations of somatic gonad cell morphogenesis and differentiation in larval life. Mutations in the D. melanogaster Insulin Receptor (InR) alter SGP cell number but not ovarian morphogenesis, while targeted loss of function of bric-à-brac 2 (bab2) affects morphogenesis without changing SGP cell number. Thus, evolution can produce similar ovariole numbers through distinct developmental mechanisms, likely controlled by different genetic mechanisms.",2012,"Delbert A Green 2nd, Cassandra G Extavour, Delbert A Green 2nd, Cassandra G Extavour"
"Selection and methionine accumulation in the fat body protein 2 gene (FBP2), a duplicate of the Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) gene",9010133,10.1007/pl00006118,"The Drosophila fat body protein 2 gene (Fbp2) is an ancient duplication of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (Adh) which encodes a protein that differs substantially from ADH in its methionine content. In D. melanogaster, there is one methionine in ADH, while there are 51 (20% of all amino acids) in FBP2. Methionine is involved in 46% of amino acid replacements when Fbp2 DNA sequences are compared between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. Methionine accumulation does not affect conserved residues of the ADH-ADHr-FBP2 multigene family. The multigene family has evolved by replacement of mildly hydrophobic amino acids by methionine with no apparent reversion. Its short-term evolution was compared between two Drosophila species, while its long-term evolution was compared between two genera belonging respectively to acalyptrate and calyptrate Diptera, Drosophila and Sarcophaga. The pattern of nucleotide substitution was consistent with an independent accumulation of methionines at the Fbp2 locus in each lineage. Under a steady-state model, the rate of methionine accumulation was constant in the lineage leading to Drosophila, and was twice as fast as that in the calyptrate lineage. Substitution rates were consistent with a slight positive selective advantage for each methionine change in about one-half of amino acid sites in Drosophila. This shows that selection can potentially account for a large proportion of amino acid replacements in the molecular evolution of proteins.",1997,"G K Meghlaoui, M Veuille, G K Meghlaoui, M Veuille"

Synaptic thermoprotection in a desert-dwelling Drosophila species,15818554,10.1002/neu.20132,"Synaptic transmission is a critical mechanism for transferring information from the nervous system to the body. Environmental stress, such as extreme temperature, can disrupt synaptic transmission and result in death. Previous work on larval Drosophila has shown that prior heat-shock exposure protects synaptic transmission against failure during subsequent thermal stress. This induced thermoprotection has been ascribed to an up-regulation of the inducible heat-shock protein, Hsp70. However, the mechanisms mediating natural thermoprotection in the wild are unknown. We compared synaptic thermosensitivity between D. melanogaster and a desert species, D. arizonae. Synaptic thermosensitivity and the functional limits of the related locomotor behavior differed significantly between closely related, albeit ecologically distinct species. Locomotory behavior of wandering third instar D. arizonae larvae was less thermosensitive and the upper temperature limit of locomotory function exceeded that of D. melanogaster by 6 degrees C. Behavioral results corresponded with significantly lower synaptic thermosensitivity at the neuromuscular junction in D. arizonae. Prior heat-shock protected only D. melanogaster by increasing relative excitatory junctional potential (EJP) duration, the time required for EJP failure at 40 degrees C, and the incidence of EJP recovery following heat-induced failure. Hsp70 induction profiles following heat-shock demonstrate up-regulation of inducible Hsp70 in D. melanogaster but not in D. arizonae. However, expression of Hsp70 under control conditions is greater in D. arizonae. These results suggest that the mechanisms of natural thermoprotection involve an increase in baseline Hsp70 expression.",2005,"Amy E M Newman, Chengfeng Xiao, R Meldrum Robertson, Amy E M Newman, Chengfeng Xiao, R Meldrum Robertson"
Parallel Sequencing of Wolbachia wCer2 from Donor and Novel Hosts Reveals Multiple Incompatibility Factors and Genome Stability after Host Transfers,32163151,10.1093/gbe/evaa050,"The application of Wolbachia in insect pest and vector control requires the establishment of genotypically stable host associations. The cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) inducing Wolbachia strain wCer2 naturally occurs in the cherry fruit fly Rhagoletis cerasi as co-infection with other strains and was transferred to other fruit fly species by embryonic microinjections. We obtained wCer2 genome data from its native and three novel hosts, Drosophila simulans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Ceratitis capitata and assessed its genome stability, characteristics, and CI factor (cif) genes. De novo assembly was successful from Wolbachia cell-enriched singly infected D. simulans embryos, with minimal host and other bacterial genome traces. The low yield of Wolbachia sequence reads from total genomic extracts of one multiply infected R. cerasi pupa and one singly infected C. capitata adult limited de novo assemblies but was sufficient for comparative analyses. Across hosts wCer2 was stable in genome synteny and content. Polymorphic nucleotide sites were found in wCer2 of each host; however, only one nucleotide was different between R. cerasi and C. capitata, and none between replicated D. simulans lines. The wCer2 genome is highly similar to wAu (D. simulans), wMel (D. melanogaster), and wRec (Drosophila recens). In contrast to wMel and wRec (each with one cif gene pair) and wAu (without any cif genes), wCer2 has three pairs of Type I cif genes, and one Type V cifB gene without a cifA complement.

Molecular characterization and evolution of a gene family encoding both female- and male-specific reproductive proteins in Drosophila,24682282,10.1093/molbev/msu114,"Gene duplication is an important mechanism for the evolution of new reproductive proteins. However, in most cases, each resulting paralog continues to function within the same sex. To investigate the possibility that seminal fluid proteins arise through duplicates of female reproductive genes that become ""co-opted"" by males, we screened female reproductive genes in Drosophila melanogaster for cases of duplication in which one of the resulting paralogs produces a protein in males that is transferred to females during mating. We identified a set of three tandemly duplicated genes that encode secreted serine-type endopeptidase homologs, two of which are expressed primarily in the female reproductive tract (RT), whereas the third is expressed specifically in the male RT and encodes a seminal fluid protein. Evolutionary and gene expression analyses across Drosophila species suggest that this family arose from a single-copy gene that was female-specific; after duplication, one paralog evolved male-specific expression. Functional tests of knockdowns of each gene in D. melanogaster show that one female-expressed gene is essential for full fecundity, and both female-expressed genes contribute singly or in combination to a female's propensity to remate. In contrast, knockdown of the male-expressed paralog had no significant effect on female fecundity or remating. These data are consistent with a model in which members of this gene family exert effects on females by acting on a common, female-expressed target. After duplication and male co-option of one paralog, the evolution of the interacting proteins could have resulted in differential strengths or effects of each paralog.",2014,"Laura K Sirot, Geoffrey D Findlay, Jessica L Sitnik, Dorina Frasheri, Frank W Avila, Mariana F Wolfner, Laura K Sirot, Geoffrey D Findlay, Jessica L Sitnik, Dorina Frasheri, Frank W Avila, Mariana F Wolfner"
COMPETITION AND GENOTYPE-BY-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION IN NATURAL BREEDING SUBSTRATES OF DROSOPHILA,28565175,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1999.tb05343.x,"Although empirical studies frequently suggest that genotype-by-environment (G X E) interaction can maintain genetic variation, very few data are available to test for the specific conditions necessary for the existence of a protected polymorphism (i.e., the property of persistence of an allele even when initially rare). Drosophila species live in patchy environments and their local population structure may be characterized to some extent by Levene's migration pattern, namely by a single pool of individuals that presumably mate at random and breed on discrete and ephemeral resources. We present here a field experiment that links Drosophila ecology and population genetics, which used the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) and α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (αGpdh) polymorphic loci in D. melanogaster flies raised from Opuntia ficus-indica fruits (prickly pears). The results show that there is density-dependent mortality in those fruits with a relatively high number of larvae (i.e., selection is ""soft"") and suggest that there is differential viability for αGpdh genotypes. Additionally, a pattern of G X E interaction for fitness values, which is fully compatible with the theoretical conditions required for the existence of a protected polymorphism, was found after weighting the fitness estimates by the relative contribution that each fruit makes to the total adult population. The strong association between AdhS and αGpdhF alleles suggests that the occurrence of the common cosmopolitan inversion In(2L)t in the population might be responsible for the negative frequency-dependent selection predicted by Levene's model when genetic variation persists in heterogeneous environments.",1999,"Mauro Santos, Karel T Eisses, Antonio Fontdevila, Mauro Santos, Karel T Eisses, Antonio Fontdevila"

Gene expression and reproductive abilities of male Drosophila melanogaster subjected to ELF-EMF exposure,24157427,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2013.10.004,"Extremely low frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) exposure is attracting increased attention as a possible disease-inducing factor. The in vivo effects of short-term and long-term ELF-EMF exposure on male Drosophila melanogaster were studied using transcriptomic analysis for preliminary screening and QRT-PCR for further verification. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that 439 genes were up-regulated and 874 genes were down-regulated following short-term exposures and that 514 genes were up-regulated and 1206 genes were down-regulated following long-term exposures (expression >2- or <0.5-fold, respectively). In addition, there are 238 up-regulated genes and 598 down-regulated genes in the intersection of short-term and long-term exposure (expression >2- or <0.5-fold). The DEGs (differentially expressed genes) in D. melanogaster following short-term exposures were involved in metabolic processes, cytoskeletal organization, mitotic spindle organization, cell death, protein modification and proteolysis. Long-term exposure let to changes in expression of genes involved in metabolic processes, response to stress, mitotic spindle organization, aging, cell death and cellular respiration. In the intersection of short-term and long-term exposure, a series of DEGs were related to apoptosis, aging, immunological stress and reproduction. To check the ELF-EMF effects on reproduction, some experiments on male reproduction ability were performed. Their results indicated that short-term ELF-EMF exposure may decrease the reproductive ability of males, but long-term exposures had no effect on reproductive ability. Down-regulation of ark gene in the exposed males suggests that the decrease in reproductive capacity may be induced by the effects of ELF-EMF exposure on spermatogenesis through the caspase pathway. QRT-PCR analysis confirmed that jra, ark and decay genes were down regulated in males exposed for 1 Generation (1G) and 72 h, which suggests that apoptosis may be inhibited in vivo. ELF-EMF exposure may have accelerated cell senescence, as suggested by the down-regulation of both cat and jra genes and the up-regulation of hsp22 gene. Up-regulation of totA and hsp22 genes during exposure suggests that exposed flies might induce an in vivo immune response to counter the adverse effects encountered during ELF-EMF exposure. Down-regulation of cat genes suggests that the partial oxidative protection system might be restrained, especially during short-term exposures. This study demonstrates the bioeffects of ELF-EMF exposure and provides evidence for understanding the in vivo mechanisms of ELF-EMF exposure on male D. melanogaster.",2013,"Si-Si Li, Zi-Yan Zhang, Chuan-Jun Yang, Hui-Yong Lian, Peng Cai, Si-Si Li, Zi-Yan Zhang, Chuan-Jun Yang, Hui-Yong Lian, Peng Cai"
Evolution of the autosomal chorion cluster in Drosophila. III. Comparison of the s18 gene in evolutionarily distant species and heterospecific control of chorion gene amplification,2213881,10.1016/S0022-2836(05)80341-9,"We present a total of 6.1 x 10(3) base-pairs of DNA sequences, encompassing the s18 gene and flanking regions within the autosomal chorion cluster of three Drosophila species. Against a background of extensive divergence in the intron and even in parts of the coding region, islands of strong sequence conservation are evident. These are particularly notable in the 5' flanking DNA where they extend to approximately -600 base-pairs from the transcription start site. The most conserved segment of the entire chorion cluster is 71 base-pairs in the s18 5' flanking DNA, which in D. melanogaster is part of a region defined functionally as containing amplification control elements (ACE3 region). Transformation analysis, using chimeric transposons of D. melanogaster and D. grimshawi DNA, revealed that amplification control elements of D. grimshawi can support amplification in D. melanogaster. The functionally defined ACE3 region of D. grimshawi includes the conserved 71 base-pair segment, but also non-conserved sequences further upstream, which apparently enhance amplification.",1990,"C Swimmer, M G Fenerjian, J C Martínez-Cruzado, F C Kafatos, C Swimmer, M G Fenerjian, J C Martínez-Cruzado, F C Kafatos"
Glucose Availability Alters Gene and Protein Expression of Several Newly Classified and Putative Solute Carriers in Mice Cortex Cell Culture and D. melanogaster,32733888,10.3389/fcell.2020.00579,"Many newly identified solute carriers (SLCs) and putative transporters have the possibility to be intricately involved in glucose metabolism. Here we show that many transporters of this type display a high degree of regulation at both mRNA and protein level following no or low glucose availability in mouse cortex cultures. We show that this is also the case in Drosophila melanogaster subjected to starvation or diets with different sugar content. Interestingly, re-introduction of glucose to media, or refeeding flies, normalized the gene expression of a number of the targets, indicating a fast and highly dynamic control. Our findings demonstrate high conservation of these transporters and how dependent both cell cultures and organisms are on gene and protein regulation during metabolic fluctuations. Several transporter genes were regulated simultaneously maybe to initiate alternative metabolic pathways as a response to low glucose levels, both in the cell cultures and in D. melanogaster. Our results display that newly identified SLCs of Major Facilitator Superfamily type, as well as the putative transporters included in our study, are regulated by glucose availability and could be involved in several cellular aspects dependent of glucose and/or its metabolites. Recently, a correlation between dysregulation of glucose in the central nervous system and numerous diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as neurological disease such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases indicate a complex regulation and fine tuning of glucose levels in the brain. The fact that almost one third of transporters and transporter-related proteins remain orphans with unknown or contradictive substrate profile, location and function, pinpoint the need for further research about them to fully understand their mechanistic role and their impact on cellular metabolism.",2020,"Mikaela M Ceder, Emilia Lekholm, Axel Klaesson, Rekha Tripathi, Nadine Schweizer, Lydia Weldai, Sourabh Patil, Robert Fredriksson, Mikaela M Ceder, Emilia Lekholm, Axel Klaesson, Rekha Tripathi, Nadine Schweizer, Lydia Weldai, Sourabh Patil, Robert Fredriksson"
Peumus boldus (Boldo) Aqueous Extract Present Better Protective Effect than Boldine Against Manganese-Induced Toxicity in D. melanogaster,27350578,10.1007/s11064-016-1984-z,"The cellular, intracellular and molecular mechanism(s) underlying the toxicity of Mn are still incompletely understood, although several points concerning Mn neurotoxicity have been addressed. Importantly, oxidative changes have been reported to be involved in Mn-induced toxicity. As a consequence, antioxidants are expected to offer protection in Drosophila melanogaster exposed to this metal. So, in this study we evaluated the hypothesis that the aqueous extract of boldo (Peumus boldus), and its alkaloids boldine, could prevent/ameliorate behavioral and oxidative alterations induced by Mn in a D. melanogaster intoxication model. Adult wild-type flies were concomitantly exposed to Mn (3 mM) and boldo aqueous extract (5 mg/mL) or boldine (327.37 µg/mL) in the food during 9 days. Mn-fed flies had a worse performance in the negative geotaxis assay and in the open-field test, as well as a higher incidence of mortality and TBARS levels in head and body, when compared to control group. Boldo aqueous extract was found to reduce the mortality rate of the flies exposed to Mn. In turn, boldine was ineffective against Mn-induced mortality and significantly increases mortality per se. Additionally, Mn-induced locomotors dysfunction were fully ameliorated by boldo crude extract and only partially ameliorated by boldine. Likewise, boldo completely normalize head and body TBARS levels, whereas boldine only partially normalize in body. Finally, we found that flies treated with Mn presented significantly decrease in dopamine levels. Our results suggest that boldo crude extract can exert protective effect against Mn-induced toxicity in D. melanogaster, whereas boldine do not. Moreover, our data confirm the utility of this model to investigate potential therapeutic strategies on movement disorders, such as that caused by Mn.",2016,"Matheus Chimelo Bianchini, Claudia Ortiz Alves Gularte, Dandara Fidélis Escoto, Geovana Pereira, Mateus Cristofari Gayer, Rafael Roehrs, Félix Alexandre Antunes Soares, Robson L Puntel, Matheus Chimelo Bianchini, Claudia Ortiz Alves Gularte, Dandara Fidélis Escoto, Geovana Pereira, Mateus Cristofari Gayer, Rafael Roehrs, Félix Alexandre Antunes Soares, Robson L Puntel"

New levels of transcriptome complexity at upper thermal limits in wild Drosophila revealed by exon expression analysis,24002645,10.1534/genetics.113.156224,"While the cellular heat-shock response has been a paradigm for studying the impact of thermal stress on RNA metabolism and gene expression, the genome-wide response to thermal stress and its connection to physiological stress resistance remain largely unexplored. Here, we address this issue using an array-based exon expression analysis to interrogate the transcriptome in recently established Drosophila melanogaster stocks during severe thermal stress and recovery. We first demonstrated the efficacy of exon-level analyses to reveal a level of thermally induced transcriptome complexity extending well beyond gene-level analyses. Next, we showed that the upper range of both the cellular and physiological thermal stress response profoundly affected message expression and processing in D. melanogaster, limiting expression to a small subset of transcripts, many that share features of known rapidly responding stress genes. As predicted from cellular heat-shock research, constitutive splicing was blocked in a set of novel genes; we did not detect changes to alternative splicing during heat stress, but rather induction of intronless isoforms of known heat-responsive genes. We observed transcriptome plasticity in the form of differential isoform expression during recovery from heat shock, mediated by multiple mechanisms including alternative transcription and alternative splicing. This affected genes involved in DNA regulation, immune response, and thermotolerance. These patterns highlight the complex nature of innate transcriptome responses under stress and potential for adaptive shifts through plasticity and evolved genetic responses at different hierarchical levels.",2013,"Marina Telonis-Scott, Belinda van Heerwaarden, Travis K Johnson, Ary A Hoffmann, Carla M Sgrò, Marina Telonis-Scott, Belinda van Heerwaarden, Travis K Johnson, Ary A Hoffmann, Carla M Sgrò"
The role of background selection in shaping patterns of molecular evolution and variation: evidence from variability on the Drosophila X chromosome,22377629,10.1534/genetics.111.138073,"In the putatively ancestral population of Drosophila melanogaster, the ratio of silent DNA sequence diversity for X-linked loci to that for autosomal loci is approximately one, instead of the expected ""null"" value of 3/4. One possible explanation is that background selection (the hitchhiking effect of deleterious mutations) is more effective on the autosomes than on the X chromosome, because of the lack of crossing over in male Drosophila. The expected effects of background selection on neutral variability at sites in the middle of an X chromosome or an autosomal arm were calculated for different models of chromosome organization and methods of approximation, using current estimates of the deleterious mutation rate and distributions of the fitness effects of deleterious mutations. The robustness of the results to different distributions of fitness effects, dominance coefficients, mutation rates, mapping functions, and chromosome size was investigated. The predicted ratio of X-linked to autosomal variability is relatively insensitive to these variables, except for the mutation rate and map length. Provided that the deleterious mutation rate per genome is sufficiently large, it seems likely that background selection can account for the observed X to autosome ratio of variability in the ancestral population of D. melanogaster. The fact that this ratio is much less than one in D. pseudoobscura is also consistent with the model's predictions, since this species has a high rate of crossing over. The results suggest that background selection may play a major role in shaping patterns of molecular evolution and variation.",2012,"Brian Charlesworth, Brian Charlesworth"
Hormonal regulation of Drosophila microRNA let-7 and miR-125 that target innate immunity,20798594,10.4161/fly.4.4.13008,"The steroid 20-hydroxy-ecdysone (20-HE) and the sesquiterpenoid Juvenile Hormone (JH) coordinate insect life stage transitions. 20-HE exerts these effects by the sequential induction of response genes. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans hormones also play a role in such transitions, but notably, microRNA such as let-7 and lin-4 have likewise been found to help order developmental steps. Little is known about the corresponding function of homologous microRNA in Drosophila melanogaster, and the way microRNA might be regulated by 20-HE in the fly is ambiguous. Here we used Drosophila S2 cells to analyze the effects of 20-HE on D. melanogaster microRNA let-7 and miR-125, the homolog of lin-4. The induction by 20-HE of let-7 and miR-125 in S2 cells is inhibited by RNAi knockdown of the ecdysone receptor and, as previously shown, by knockdown of its cofactor broad-complex C. To help resolve the currently ambiguous role of 20-HE in the control of microRNA, we show that nanomolar concentrations of 20-HE primes cells to subsequently express microRNA when exposed to micromolar levels of 20-HE. We then explore the role microRNA plays in the established relationship between 20-HE and the induction of innate immunity. We show that the 3'UTR of the antimicrobial peptide diptericin has a let-7 binding site and that let-7 represses translation from this site. We conclude that 20-HE facilitates the initial expression of innate immunity while it simultaneously induces negative regulation via microRNA control of antimicrobial peptide translation.",2010,"Alina Garbuzov, Marc Tatar, Alina Garbuzov, Marc Tatar"
How Drosophila melanogaster Forms its Mechanoreceptors,19471605,10.2174/138920208785133271,"A strictly determined number of external sensory organs, macrochaetes, acting as mechanoreceptors, are orderly located on drosophila head and body. Totally, they form the bristle pattern, which is a species-specific characteristic of drosophila.Each mechanoreceptor comprises four specialized cells derived from the single sensory organ precursor (SOP) cell. The conserved bristle pattern combined with a comparatively simple structure of each mechanosensory organ makes macrochaetes a convenient model for studying the formation spatial structures with a fixed number of elements at certain positions and the mechanism underlying cell differentiation.The macrochaete morphogenesis consists of three stages. At the first stage, the proneural clusters segregate from the massive of ectodermal cells of the wing imaginal disc. At the second stage, the SOP cell is determined and its position in the cluster is specified. At the third stage, the SOP cell undergoes two asymmetric divisions, and the daughter cells differentiate into the components of mechanoreceptor: shaft, socket, bipolar neuron, and sheath.The critical factor determining the neural pathway of cell development is the content of proneural proteins, products of the achaete-scute (AS-C) gene complex, reaching its maximum in the SOP cell.The experimental data on the main genes and their products involved in the control of bristle pattern formation are systematized. The roles of achaete-scute complex, EGFR and Notch signaling pathways, and selector genes in these processes are considered. An integral scheme describing the functioning of the system controlling macrochaete development in D. melanogaster is proposed based on analysis of literature data.",2008,"D P Furman, T A Bukharina, D P Furman, T A Bukharina"
A genetic system to detect mitotic recombination between repeated chromosomal sequences in Drosophila Schneider line 2 cells,9465910,10.1016/s1383-5718(97)00138-1,"In order to study mitotic homologous recombination in somatic Drosophila melanogaster cells in vitro and to learn more on the question how recombination is influenced by mutagens, a genetic system was developed where spontaneous and drug-induced recombination could be monitored. Two recombination reporter substrates were stably introduced in multiple copies into the genome of established D. melanogaster Schneider line 2 cells: one plasmid (pSB310) contained the 5' and 3' deleted neomycin phosphoribosyltransferase alleles neoL and neoR as direct repeats; the other (pSB485) contained similar deletions (lacZL and lacZR) of the beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ). Restoration of a functional neo gene upon mitotic recombination between homologous sequences allowed direct selection for the event, whereas recombination in single cells harbouring the integrated lacZ-based reporter plasmid was detected by histochemical staining or flow cytometric analysis (FACS). The neo-based construct in the clonal transgenic cell line 44CD4 showed a spontaneous recombination frequency of 2.9 x 10(-4), whereas the 485AD1 cell line harbouring the lacZ-based construct exhibited a frequency of 2.8 x 10(-4). The alkylating agents EMS and MMS and the clastogen mitomycin C were able to induce recombination in the 485AD1 cell line in a dose-dependent manner. The results obtained from these studies suggest that the transgenic cell lines are potentially useful tools for identifying agents which stimulate direct repeat recombination in somatic Drosophila cells.",1997,"S Bärtsch, F E Würgler, C Sengstag, S Bärtsch, F E Würgler, C Sengstag"

We sequenced and compared this region from several different Drosophila species belonging to various groups within the Drosophila and Sophophora subgenera. This part of per shows a great variability in both DNA sequence and length. Furthermore, analysis of the data suggests that changes in the length of this variable region might be associated with amino acid replacements in the more conserved flanking sequences.",1993,"A A Peixoto, S Campesan, R Costa, C P Kyriacou, A A Peixoto, S Campesan, R Costa, C P Kyriacou"

Single transcript imaging to assay gene expression in wholemount Drosophila melanogaster tissues,30118816,10.1016/j.mod.2018.08.006,"Single molecule Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (smFISH) for mRNA provides a powerful quantitative handle on expression from endogenous gene loci. While the method has been widely applied in cells in culture, applications to primary tissue samples remain fewer, and often use involved cryosectioning. Even apart from quantitative access to absolute transcript counts in specific tissue volumes, many other advantages of smFISH can be envisaged in tissue samples. Primary among these are the ability to report on subtle differences in expression among different cell types within a tissue, and the ability to correlate the expression from different target genes. Here, we present a modified method of smFISH applicable on various primary wholemount tissues from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and show the efficacy of the method in a variety of larval and adult tissue, and embryos. We also combine smFISH in tissue with immunofluorescence to demonstrate the possibility of capturing transcriptional and translational aspects of gene expression in the same tissue. Given the widespread use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model system in Developmental Biology and Genetics, such methods are likely to be of wide interest and could yield rich information about gene expression in tissues from this organism.",2018,"Nikhita Pasnuri, Purnati Khuntia, Aprotim Mazumder, Nikhita Pasnuri, Purnati Khuntia, Aprotim Mazumder"

"Involvement of EDTP, an egg-derived tyrosine phosphatase, in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster",16428301,10.1093/jb/mvi176,"Previously, we purified a novel protein tyrosine phosphatase from eggs of the flesh fly, Sarcophaga peregrina. This protein tyrosine phosphatase, named egg-derived tyrosine phosphatase (EDTP), is expressed during oogenesis and early embryogenesis but is rapidly degraded in middle embryogenesis by lysosomal cathepsin L. Here, we demonstrate the requirement of EDTP in the development of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Deletion of the Drosophila EDTP gene using transposase-catalyzed imprecise excision resulted in homozygous lethals during embryogenesis. Additionally, germline clones generated using the FLP-FRT-ovo(D) system showed severe defects in ovarian development during oogenesis. These results indicate that the Drosophila EDTP gene is crucial in oogenesis and embryogenesis.",2005,"Shinji Yamaguchi, Sachiko Katagiri, Kazuhisa Sekimizu, Shunji Natori, Koichi J Homma, Shinji Yamaguchi, Sachiko Katagiri, Kazuhisa Sekimizu, Shunji Natori, Koichi J Homma"

With similar techniques we had found previously that vertebrate photoreceptors have few, if any, bodies with cytochemically demonstrable oxidase activity, but that the pigment epithelial cells adjacent to the photoreceptors have a substantial population of such bodies. Peroxisomes in Drosophila were very abundant in the fat body. Probable peroxisomes were also present in the peripheral retina of the eye, including in retinular (retinula) and pigment cells, but there were very few of them. Thus, our results suggest that the fat body, which lies adjacent to the eye, is the principal site of peroxisomal function in the head. Peroxisome functions in the Drosophila head may include participation in the genesis of eye pigments.",1990,"R St Jules, W Setlik, J Kennard, E Holtzman, R St Jules, W Setlik, J Kennard, E Holtzman"
Drosophila oogenesis as a bio-marker responding to EMF sources,23915130,10.3109/15368378.2013.800102,"The model biological organisms Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis have been utilized to assess effects on apoptotic cell death of follicles during oogenesis and reproductive capacity (fecundity) decline.

Mobile phone was used as a reference exposure system for evaluating factors considered very important in dosimetry extending our published work with D. melanogaster to the insect D. virilis. Distance from the emitting source, the exposure duration and the repeatability were examined. All EMF sources used created statistically significant effects regarding fecundity and cell death-apoptosis induction, even at very low intensity levels (0.3 V/m blue tooth radiation), well below ICNIRP's guidelines, suggesting that Drosophila oogenesis system is suitable to be used as a biomarker for exploring potential EMF bioactivity. Also, there is no linear cumulative effect when increasing the duration of exposure or using one EMF source after the other (i.e. mobile phone and DECT handset) at the specific conditions used.

Regulation of mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein gene expression links nuclear and mitochondrial DNA replication in drosophila,10788480,10.1074/jbc.275.18.13628,"The structural organization of the Drosophila melanogaster gene encoding mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein (mtSSB) has been determined and its pattern of expression evaluated during Drosophila development. The D. melanogaster mtSSB gene contains four exons and three small introns. The transcriptional initiation site is located 22 nucleotides upstream from the initiator translation codon in adults, whereas several initiation sites are found in embryos. No consensus TATA or CAAT sequences are located at canonical positions, although an AT-rich sequence was identified flanking the major transcriptional initiation site. Northern analyses indicated that the mtSSB transcript is present at variable levels throughout development. In situ hybridization analysis shows that maternally deposited mtSSB mRNA is distributed homogeneously in the early embryo, whereas de novo transcript is produced specifically at an elevated level in the developing midgut. Transfection assays in cultured Schneider cells with promoter region deletion constructs revealed that the proximal 230 nucleotides contain cis-acting elements required for efficient gene expression. Putative transcription factor binding sites clustered within this region include two Drosophila DNA replication-related elements (DRE) and a single putative E2F binding site. Deletion and base substitution mutagenesis of the DRE sites demonstrated that they are required for efficient promoter activity, and gel electrophoretic mobility shift analyses showed that DRE binding factor (DREF) binds to these sites. Our data suggest strongly that the Drosophila mtSSB gene is regulated by the DRE/DREF system.

"Cystathionine β-synthase Deficiency Impairs Vision in the Fruit Fly, Drosophila melanogaster",32865440,10.1080/02713683.2020.1818262,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      Deficiency in Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) leads to an abnormal accumulation of homocysteine and results in classical homocystinuria, a multi-systemic disorder that affects connective tissue, muscles, the central nervous system, and the eyes. However, the genetic players and mechanisms underlying vision alterations in patients with homocystinuria are little understood.
    

    
  


        Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a useful system to investigate the genetic basis of several human diseases, but no study to date has used Drosophila as model of homocystinuria. Here, we use Drosophila genetic tools to down-regulate CBS expression and evaluate its behavioral response to light.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We show that CBS-deficient flies do not display the normal stereotypical behavior of attraction towards a luminous source, known as phototaxis. This behavior cannot be attributed to a motor or olfactory deficiency, but it is most likely related to a lower visual acuity. CBS-deficient flies are overall smaller, but smaller eyes do not explain their lack of phototactic response.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The vision phenotype of CBS knock-down flies is consistent with severe myopia in homocystinuria patients. We propose to use Drosophila as a model to investigate ocular manifestations underlying homocystinuria.",2020,"Marycruz Flores-Flores, Leonardo Moreno-García, Felipe Castro-Martínez, Marcos Nahmad, Marycruz Flores-Flores, Leonardo Moreno-García, Felipe Castro-Martínez, Marcos Nahmad"
Minocycline effect on life and health span of Drosophila melanogaster,23185716,,"Up-regulation of kynurenine (KYN) pathway of tryptophan (TRP) was suggested as one of the mechanisms of aging and aging-associated disorders. Genetic and pharmacological impairment of TRP - KYN metabolism resulted in prolongation of life span in Drosophila models. Minocycline, an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective properties independent of its antibacterial activity, inhibited KYN formation from TRP. Since minocycline is the only FDA approved for human use medication with inhibitory effect on TRP - KYN metabolism, we were interested to study minocycline effect on life- and health-spans in Drosophila model. Minocycline (0.87mM) prolonged mean, median and maximum life span of wild-type Oregon Drosophila melanogaster of both genders. Minocycline (0.87 mM) stimulated vertical climbing in male flies. Minocycline dose-dependently decreased quantity and survivorship of pupae of filial generation. Minocycline might be a promising candidate drug for anti-aging intervention and treatment of aging-associated medical and psychiatric disorders. The role of TRP - KYN metabolism in the mechanisms of minocycline-effect on life- and health-span might be elucidated by the future assessment of minocycline effects in Drosophila mutants naturally or artificially knockout for genes impacting the key enzymes of KYN pathway of TRP metabolism.",2012,"Gregory Oxenkrug, Valeriya Navrotskaya, Lyudmila Vorobyova, Paul Summergrad, Gregory Oxenkrug, Valeriya Navrotskaya, Lyudmila Vorobyova, Paul Summergrad"
Evolutionary genetics of Drosophila esterases,8119594,10.1007/BF01435043,"Over 30 carboxylester hydrolases have been identified in D. melanogaster. Most are classified as acetyl, carboxyl or cholinesterases. Sequence similarities among most of the carboxyl and all the cholinesterases so far characterised from D. melanogaster and other eukaryotes justify recognition of a carboxyl/cholinesterase multigene family. This family shows minimal sequence similarities with other esterases but crystallographic data for a few non-drosophilid enzymes show that the family shares a distinctive overall structure with some other carboxyl and aryl esterases, so they are all put in one superfamily of/beta hydrolases. Fifteen esterase genes have been mapped in D. melanogaster and twelve are clustered at two chromosomal sites. The constitution of each cluster varies across Drosophila species but two carboxyl esterases in one cluster are sufficiently conserved that their homologues can be identified among enzymes conferring insecticide resistance in other Diptera. Sequence differences between two other esterases, the EST6 carboxyl esterase and acetylcholinesterase, have been interpreted against the consensus super-secondary structure for the carboxyl/cholinesterase multigene family; their sequence differences are widely dispersed across the structure and include substantial divergence in substrate binding sites and the active site gorge. This also applies when EST6 is compared across species where differences in its expression indicate a difference in function. However, comparisons within and among species where EST6 expression is conserved show that many aspects of the predicted super-secondary structure are tightly conserved. Two notable exceptions are a pair of polymorphisms in the substrate binding site of the enzyme in D. melanogaster. These polymorphisms are associated with differences in substrate interactions in vitro and demographic data indicate that the alternative forms are not selectively equivalent in vivo.",1993,"J G Oakeshott, E A van Papenrecht, T M Boyce, M J Healy, R J Russell, J G Oakeshott, E A van Papenrecht, T M Boyce, M J Healy, R J Russell"

The discrimination was asymmetrical in that Canton-S females clearly distinguished between the two types of males in no-choice tests, but Tai-Y females did not. F1 females expressed an intermediate ability to discriminate, and female progeny of backcrosses expressed a mating phenotype very similar to that of the parental strain to which the backcross was made.

Factors affecting the frequency of infection by the sigma virus in experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster,6816192,10.1007/BF01314721,"The experiments reported in this paper deal with the maintenance of the non contagious, hereditary virus sigma in populations of its host, Drosophila melanogaster. Evidence was previously provided of the existence of two viral Types I and II, depending on their sensitivity to the ref(2)Pp allele (the ref(2)P locus interferes with the multiplication of the virus in the fly). The viral Type I which is the most sensitive to the ref(2)Pp allele, is eliminated in the presence of this allele, even when most of the flies were originally infected in the population. On the contrary, the presence of the ref(2)Pp allele does not prevent a viral Type II, introduced in a population, from infecting most of the flies. The possibility that a change has occurred recently in French natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster is discussed.",1982,"A Fleuriet, A Fleuriet"

Food Safety and Nutraceutical Potential of Caramel Colour Class IV Using In Vivo and In Vitro Assays,31491925,10.3390/foods8090392,"Nutraceutical activity of food is analysed to promote the healthy characteristics of diet where additives are highly used. Caramel is one of the most worldwide consumed additives and it is produced by heating natural carbohydrates. The aim of this study was to evaluate the food safety and the possible nutraceutical potential of caramel colour class IV (CAR). For this purpose, in vivo toxicity/antitoxicity, genotoxicity/antigenotoxicity and longevity assays were performed using the Drosophila melanogaster model. In addition, cytotoxicity, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, single cell gel electrophoresis and methylation status assays were conducted in the in vitro HL-60 human leukaemia cell line. Our results reported that CAR was neither toxic nor genotoxic and showed antigenotoxic effects in Drosophila. Furthermore, CAR induced cytotoxicity and hipomethylated sat-α repetitive element using HL-60 cell line. In conclusion, the food safety of CAR was demonstrated, since Lethal Dose 50 (LD50) was not reached in toxicity assay and any of the tested concentrations induced mutation rates higher than that of the concurrent control in D. melanogaster. On the other hand, CAR protected DNA from oxidative stress provided by hydrogen peroxide in Drosophila. Moreover, CAR showed chemopreventive activity and modified the methylation status of HL-60 cell line.

Disruption of insulin signalling affects the neuroendocrine stress reaction in Drosophila females,25214494,10.1242/jeb.106815,"Juvenile hormone (JH) and dopamine are involved in the stress response in insects. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling pathway has also recently been found to be involved in the regulation of various processes, including stress tolerance. However, the relationships between the JH, dopamine and insulin signalling pathways remain unclear. Here, we study the role of insulin signalling in the regulation of JH and dopamine metabolism under normal and heat stress conditions in Drosophila melanogaster females. We show that suppression of the insulin-like receptor (InR) in the corpus allatum, a specialised endocrine gland that synthesises JH, causes an increase in dopamine level and JH-hydrolysing activity and alters the activities of enzymes that produce as well as those that degrade dopamine [alkaline phosphatase (ALP), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-dependent arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (DAT)]. We also found that InR suppression in the corpus allatum modulates dopamine, ALP, TH and JH-hydrolysing activity in response to heat stress and that it decreases the fecundity of the flies. JH application restores dopamine metabolism and fecundity in females with decreased InR expression in the corpus allatum. Our data provide evidence that the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling pathway regulates dopamine metabolism in females of D. melanogaster via the system of JH metabolism and that it affects the development of the neuroendocrine stress reaction and interacts with JH in the control of reproduction in this species.",2014,"Inga Y Rauschenbach, Evgenia K Karpova, Natalya V Adonyeva, Olga V Andreenkova, Natalya V Faddeeva, Elena V Burdina, Alexander A Alekseev, Petr N Menshanov, Nataly E Gruntenko, Inga Y Rauschenbach, Evgenia K Karpova, Natalya V Adonyeva, Olga V Andreenkova, Natalya V Faddeeva, Elena V Burdina, Alexander A Alekseev, Petr N Menshanov, Nataly E Gruntenko"
"The chromatin landscape of Drosophila: comparisons between species, sexes, and chromosomes",24840603,10.1101/gr.172155.114,"The chromatin landscape is key for gene regulation, but little is known about how it differs between sexes or between species. Here, we study the sex-specific chromatin landscape of Drosophila miranda, a species with young sex chromosomes, and compare it with Drosophila melanogaster. We analyze six histone modifications in male and female larvae of D. miranda (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K36me3, H4K16ac, H3K27me3, and H3K9me2), and define seven biologically meaningful chromatin states that show different enrichments for transcribed and silent genes, repetitive elements, housekeeping, and tissue-specific genes. The genome-wide distribution of both active and repressive chromatin states differs between males and females. In males, active chromatin is enriched on the X, relative to females, due to dosage compensation of the hemizygous X. Furthermore, a smaller fraction of the euchromatic portion of the genome is in a repressive chromatin state in males relative to females. However, sex-specific chromatin states appear not to explain sex-biased expression of genes. Overall, conservation of chromatin states between male and female D. miranda is comparable to conservation between D. miranda and D. melanogaster, which diverged >30 MY ago. Active chromatin states are more highly conserved across species, while heterochromatin shows very low levels of conservation. Divergence in chromatin profiles contributes to expression divergence between species, with ∼26% of genes in different chromatin states in the two species showing species-specific or species-biased expression, an enrichment of approximately threefold over null expectation. Our data suggest that heteromorphic sex chromosomes in males (that is, a hypertranscribed X and an inactivated Y) may contribute to global redistribution of active and repressive chromatin marks between chromosomes and sexes.",2014,"Emily J Brown, Doris Bachtrog, Emily J Brown, Doris Bachtrog"
Systematic Curation of miRBase Annotation Using Integrated Small RNA High-Throughput Sequencing Data for C. elegans and Drosophila,22303321,10.3389/fgene.2011.00025,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of 20-23 nucleotide small RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally in animals and plants. Annotation of miRNAs by the miRNA database (miRBase) has largely relied on computational approaches. As a result, many miRBase entries lack experimental validation, and discrepancies between miRBase annotation and actual miRNA sequences are often observed. In this study, we integrated the small RNA sequencing (smRNA-seq) datasets in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster and devised an analytical pipeline coupled with detailed manual inspection to curate miRNA annotation systematically in miRBase. Our analysis reveals 19 (17.0%) and 51 (31.3%) miRNAs entries with detectable smRNA-seq reads have mature sequence discrepancies in C. elegans and D. melanogaster, respectively. These discrepancies frequently occur either for conserved miRNA families whose mature sequences were predicted according to their homologous counterparts in other species or for miRNAs whose precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) hairpins produce an abundance of multiple miRNA isoforms or variants. Our analysis shows that while Drosophila pre-miRNAs, on average, produce less than 60% accurate mature miRNA reads in addition to their 5' and 3' variant isoforms, the precision of miRNA processing in C. elegans is much higher, at over 90%. Based on the revised miRNA sequences, we analyzed expression patterns of the more conserved (MC) and less conserved (LC) miRNAs and found that, whereas MC miRNAs are often co-expressed at multiple developmental stages, LC miRNAs tend to be expressed specifically at fewer stages.",2011,"Xiangfeng Wang, X Shirley Liu, Xiangfeng Wang, X Shirley Liu"
"Genetic and functional analysis of PARP, a DNA strand break-binding enzyme",11376690,10.1016/s0027-5107(01)00110-5,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is a nuclear enzyme activated by binding to a single- or double-strand break of DNA and is one of the death substrates for caspase-3 in apoptosis. The nuclear function of PARP is well studied and recent PARP-knockout studies indicate that PARP takes part in chromosomal stability. To analyze the effect of PARP overexpression, or loss of function, we have cloned PARP cDNA and the gene from Drosophila melanogaster and studied its function in developmental stages. Organization of exons corresponds to the functional domains of PARP. An alternatively spliced form of PARP lacking exon 5, which encodes the auto-modification domain, is found in Drosophila. Expression of the PARP gene is at high levels in embryos at 0-6h after egg laying and gradually decreased. In situ mRNA hybridization indicates localization of PARP mRNA in cells along the central nervous system at a late stage of embryogenesis. Overexpression of the gene in the developing eye primordia of D. melanogaster is an excellent experimental model to analyze the cell cycle and programmed cell death. We introduced PARP expression vector overexpresses PARP in the eye discs of Drosophila, and established the PARP transgenic flies by P element-mediated germ line transformation. These flies showed mild roughening of the normally smooth ommatidial lattice involving tissue polarity disruption characterized by missrotation and incorrect chirality of ommatidia.

We also briefly describe the organization of the neuronal circuits in which IRs function, comparing and contrasting them with the sensory pathways expressing ORs.

I elements of Drosophila melanogaster belong to this class and are responsible for the I-R system of hybrid dysgenesis. Many results indicate that at the beginning of the century natural populations of this species were devoid of active I elements and that they were invaded by functional I elements in the last decades. Many Drosophila species contain both defective and active I elements. It seems that the latter were lost in Drosophila melanogaster before its spread throughout the world, and that the recent invasion results from the spread of functional elements originating either from another species by horizontal transfer or from an isolated population of the same species.

Identification of gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) homologues in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,24491521,10.1016/j.dci.2014.01.007,"Gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) has been demonstrated to be involved in the immune response to bacterial challenge in various organisms. However, little is known about GILT function in innate immunity. Drosophila has been commonly used as a model for the study of the innate immune response of invertebrates. Here, we identify the CG9796, CG10157, and CG13822 genes of fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as GILT homologues. All deduced Drosophila GILT coding sequences contained the major characteristic features of the GILT protein family: the GILT signature CQHGX2ECX2NX4C sequence and the active site CXXC or CXXS motif. The mRNA transcript levels of the Drosophila GILT genes were up-regulated after Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli DH5α infection. Moreover, a bacterial load assay showed that over-expression of Drosophila GILT in fat body or hemocytes led to a low bacterial colony number whereas knock-down of Drosophila GILT in fat body or hemocytes led to a high bacterial colony number when compared to a wild-type control. These results indicate that the Drosophila GILTs are very likely to play a role in the innate immune response upon bacterial challenge of Drosophila host defense. This study may provide the basis for further study on GILT function in innate immunity.",2014,"Kittima Kongton, Kimberly McCall, Amornrat Phongdara, Kittima Kongton, Kimberly McCall, Amornrat Phongdara"

Recombinogenic activity of Pantoprazole(®) in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,25983631,10.1590/S1415-475738120140154,"Pantoprazole(®) is one of the leading proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) used in the treatment of a variety of diseases related to the upper gastrointestinal tract. However, studies have shown an increased risk of developing gastric cancer, intestinal metaplasia and hyperplasia of endocrine cells with prolonged use. In the present study, the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) was employed to determine the mutagenic effects of Pantoprazole on Drosophila melanogaster. Repeated treatments with Pantoprazole were performed on 72-hour larvae of the standard (ST) and high bioactivation (HB) crosses at concentrations of 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 μM. In addition, doxorubicin (DXR) was administered at 0.4 mM, as a positive control.

For HB descendants, a significant increase in the total number of spots was observed among the marked transheterozygous (MH) flies. Through analysis of balancer heterozygous (BH) descendants, recombinogenic effects were observed at all concentrations in descendants of the HB cross. In view of these experimental conditions and results, it was concluded that Pantoprazole is associated with recombinogenic effects in Drosophila melanogaster.",2015,"Jeyson Césary Lopes, Nayane Moreira Machado, Rosiane Soares Saturnino, Júlio César Nepomuceno, Jeyson Césary Lopes, Nayane Moreira Machado, Rosiane Soares Saturnino, Júlio César Nepomuceno"
DNA sequence of the Doc retroposon in the white-one mutant of Drosophila melanogaster and of secondary insertions in the phenotypically altered derivatives white-honey and white-eosin,1705654,10.1007/BF00282637,"We analysed the structure of the white locus of Drosophila melanogaster in a family of related white mutants. The white-one mutant has bleach white eyes, and a Doc transposable element is inserted into the promotor region of the white locus. The DNA sequence of this Doc insertion was determined, and showed it to be closely related to other Drosophila melanogaster retroposons such as the I factor and the F, G and jockey elements. There are two long open reading frames, which encode a putative nucleic acid binding protein and a putative reverse transcriptase, respectively. Two independent, partially pigmented derivatives were analysed by cloning sequences from this region. In white-honey a transposable element of the retroviral class, B104, is inserted within the Doc element. In white-eosin there is an insertion within the Doc element of a 190 bp sequence that appears to be a member of a novel family of transposable elements. This pogo element is of the same structural class as the Drosophila melanogaster P and hobo elements. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the Doc retroposon cannot excise, and that, for the white-one mutation, flies with altered phenotypes are most often generated by the insertion of additional transposable elements.",1991,"K O'Hare, M R Alley, T E Cullingford, A Driver, M J Sanderson, K O'Hare, M R Alley, T E Cullingford, A Driver, M J Sanderson"

Five of these caspases have been previously characterised. Here, we describe the Drosophila caspase, STRICA. STRICA is a caspase with a long amino-terminal prodomain that lacks any caspase recruitment domain or death effector domain. Instead, the prodomain of STRICA consists of unique serine/threonine stretches. Low levels of strica expression were detected in embryos, larvae, pupae and adult animals. STRICA is a cytoplasmic protein that, upon overexpression, caused apoptosis in cultured Drosophila SL2 cells that was partially suppressed by DIAP1. Interestingly, unlike other fly caspases, STRICA showed physical association with DIAP2, in cotransfection experiments. These results suggest that STRICA may have a unique cellular function.",2001,"J Doumanis, L Quinn, H Richardson, S Kumar, J Doumanis, L Quinn, H Richardson, S Kumar"

In wild-type strains of both species, stress resulted in delay of oviposition and in a decrease in JH hydrolysis and fertility, which lasted for several days after heat treatment. Experimental repression of juvenile hormone esterase showed that stress response of the Drosophila reproductive system is determined by the decrease in JH hydrolysis.

While data from different carotenoids are mixed in their outcomes, those for 9-cis-β-carotene indicate general positive effects, although basic data on its biological impact are limited. Here, we show that supplementation with 9-cis-β-carotene in ageing Drosophila melanogaster improved mitochondrial function in terms of ATP production and whole-body respiration and extended mean lifespan. It also resulted in improved mobility. These data provide a potential biological rational for the beneficial effects of dietary supplementation with 9-cis-β-carotene.

Drosophila melanogaster larvae control amylase secretion according to the hardness of food,23964241,10.3389/fphys.2013.00200,"Drosophila melanogaster larvae excrete amylase and perform external digestion of their food. In this study, to investigate whether their external digestion ability varies in response to changes in the external environment, we measured the relative amount of amylase excreted by larvae using a new method: the iodine starch agar method (ISAM). Analysis using this method revealed that the amount of amylase excreted by larvae increased in accordance with the increase in the agar concentration. In addition, we investigated the effect on the larval growth rate of adding amylase to the diet. Pupation occurred 24 h later in food containing 1% amylase than in food containing no amylase. These results suggest that the larvae adjust their amylase excretion in response to changes in the external environment, and that its level has a marked influence on the larval growth rate.",2013,"Honami Sakaguchi, Masataka G Suzuki, Honami Sakaguchi, Masataka G Suzuki"

When they were transferred to and maintained in the laboratory as large cage populations, frequencies of polymorphic inversions were drastically decreased and finally eliminated. This ""cage effect"" was observed irrespective of the geographical origin of the population or the initial frequency of each inversion. The decrease and elimination of inversions in the cage was not overcome by changing conditions such as medium, temperature, or the number of isofemale lines (40-600) introduced. On the other hand, in the sets of isofemale lines derived from the same geographical origins as the cage populations, each of which was maintained as a small vial population, the inversion frequencies, though decreased from the initial frequencies, were kept at significantly high levels. The cage populations initiated with one or two isofemale lines also maintained the inversion polymorphisms that were as high as vial populations.",1992,"Yutaka Inoue, Takao K Watanabe, Yutaka Inoue, Takao K Watanabe"

Variation in male effects on female fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster,24372989,10.1111/jeb.12305,"In many species, males have the capacity to directly influence (either positively or negatively) the fitness of their mates and offspring, not only via parental care contributions and/or precopulatory resource provisioning, but also via the post-copulatory activity of those substances passed on to their mates in their ejaculates. Here, we examine how an individual male's identity may be related to phenotypic variation in short-term female fecundity in the model species, Drosophila melanogaster. The effect of male identity on short-term fecundity stimulation of females was repeatable across time and accounted for over a fifth of the total observed phenotypic variation in fecundity in two independent populations. The functional explanations for these results and the implications for our understanding of the factors that contribute to the adaptive significance of mating preferences and/or sexual conflict are discussed.",2014,"H M Tennant, E E Sonser, T A F Long, H M Tennant, E E Sonser, T A F Long"

The results showed that there was no significant difference in the rates of egg-laying. However, the decrease in the rate of egg development revealed that eggs and early embryonic stages were sensitive to toxic effects. The same toxic effect was not observed in third instar larvae.

How one becomes many: blastoderm cellularization in Drosophila melanogaster,12386932,10.1002/bies.10184,"Embryonic development in Drosophila melanogaster begins with a rapid series of mitotic nuclear divisions, unaccompanied by cytokinesis, to produce a multi-nucleated single cell embryo, the syncytial blastoderm. The syncytium then undergoes a process of cell formation, in which the individual nuclei become enclosed in individual cells. This process of cellularization involves integrating mechanisms of cell polarity, cell-cell adhesion and a specialized form of cytokinesis. The detailed molecular mechanism, however, is highly complex and, despite extensive analysis, remains poorly understood. Nevertheless, new insights are emerging from recent studies on aspects of membrane polarization and insertion, which show that membrane components from intracellular organelles are involved. In addition, actin and actin-associated proteins have been heavily implicated while new evidence shows that microtubule cytoskeletal elements are mechanistically involved in all aspects of cellularization. This review will draw on both the traditional models and the new data to provide a current perspective on the nature of cellular blastoderm formation in Drosophila melanogaster.",2002,"Aveek Mazumdar, Manjari Mazumdar, Aveek Mazumdar, Manjari Mazumdar"

Although olfaction and vision contribute to food detection, the gustatory system acts as a final checkpoint control for food acceptance or rejection. The vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster tastes many of the same stimuli as mammals and provides an excellent model system for comparative studies of taste detection. The relative simplicity of the fly brain and behaviors, along with the molecular genetic and functional approaches available in this system, allow the examination of gustatory neural circuits from sensory input to motor output. This review discusses the molecules and cells that detect taste compounds in the periphery and the circuits that process taste information in the brain. These studies are providing insight into how the detection of taste compounds regulates feeding decisions.",2018,"Kristin Scott, Kristin Scott"
Apis mellifera cytoplasmic elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) is closely related to Drosophila melanogaster EF-1 alpha,2116322,10.1016/0014-5793(90)80936-d,Using low stringency hybridisation with a Drosophila melanogaster EF-1 alpha gene fragment we have isolated a genomic DNA clone encoding elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) from Apis mellifera. The hybridising Apis mellifera sequence could be delineated to two small EcoRI fragments that were also revealed by genomic Southern hybridisation. By comparison with the corresponding Drosophila melanogaster data the complete translational reading frame has been deduced. It is interrupted by two intervening sequences of 220 and about 790 nucleotides. Comparison with known eucaryotic EF-1 alpha sequences further confirms that certain amino acid sequences seem to be invariable within the EF-1 alpha protein family.,1990,"U Walldorf, B T Hovemann, U Walldorf, B T Hovemann"

Here, we demonstrate that D. suzukii and its close relative D. biarmipes are in fact more sensitive to volatiles associated with the fruit-ripening process; however, in choice-assays, both spotted-wing species are more attracted to fermented fruit than to earlier stages of fruit development, which is similar to the behavioral preferences of D. melanogaster, and thus, fruit developmental stage alone does not explain the ecological niche observed for D. suzukii. In contrast, we show that both D. suzukii and D. biarmipes are more attracted to leaf odors than D. melanogaster in behavioral trials. For D. suzukii, this differential behavioral preference towards leaves appears to be linked to β-cyclocitral, a volatile isoprenoid that we show is most likely a novel ligand for the ""ab3A"" neuron. In addition, this compound is not detected by either of the other two tested fly species.",2015,"Ian W Keesey, Markus Knaden, Bill S Hansson, Ian W Keesey, Markus Knaden, Bill S Hansson"
Comparative analysis of the nonA region in Drosophila identifies a highly diverged 5' gene that may constrain nonA promoter evolution,11156994,,"A genomic fragment from Drosophila virilis that contained all the no-on-transientA (nonA) coding information, plus several kilobases of upstream material, was identified. Comparisons of nonA sequences and the gene nonA-like in D. melanogaster, a processed duplication of nonA, suggest that it arose before the split between D. melanogaster and D. virilis. In both species, another gene that lies <350 bp upstream from the nonA transcription starts, and that probably corresponds to the lethal gene l(1)i19, was identified. This gene encodes a protein that shows similarities to GPI1, which is required for the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), a component for anchoring eukaryotic proteins to membranes, and so we have named it dGpi1. The molecular evolution of nonA and dGpi1 sequences show remarkable differences, with the latter revealing a level of amino acid divergence that is as high as that of transformer and with extremely low levels of codon bias. Nevertheless, in D. melanogaster hosts, the D. virilis fragment rescues the lethality associated with a mutation of l(1)i19e, as well as the viability and visual defects produced by deletion of nonA(-). The presence of dGpi1 sequences so close to nonA appears to have constrained the evolution of the nonA promoter.",2001,"S Campesan, D Chalmers, F Sandrelli, A Megighian, A A Peixoto, R Costa, C P Kyriacou, S Campesan, D Chalmers, F Sandrelli, A Megighian, A A Peixoto, R Costa, C P Kyriacou"
Parallel changes in puffing activity and patterns of protein synthesis in salivary glands of Drosophila,810802,10.1073/pnas.72.9.3604,"The changes in protein synthesis of salivary glands of Drosophila resulting from a brief exposure at 37 degrees have been analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate--acrylamide gels. In D. melanogaster and D. hydei this treatment induces nine and six new puffs, respectively, in the polytene chromosomes. After 20 min treatment seven new proteins are synthesized by the glands of D. melanogaster and six by those of D. hydei as detected by [35S]methionine labeling. Other agents, e.g., recovery from anaerobiosis, induce the same puffs and the same proteins. The extent of protein induction and the degree of puff induction are related to the severity of the temperature treatment. The new proteins are detected after 10 min treatmene at 37 degrees and their synthesis is inhibited by actinomycin D. Actinomycin D added 5 min after the start of temperature treatment has little effect on subsequent protein synthesis. The induced proteins are not tissue specific. Electrophoretic differences of two proteins exist between D. melanogaster and D. simulans, encouraging attempts to map the proteins' gene loci and to test directly whether or not the puffs code for them.",1975,"M Lewis, P J Helmsing, M Ashburner, M Lewis, P J Helmsing, M Ashburner"
A Drosophila model for toxicogenomics: Genetic variation in susceptibility to heavy metal exposure,28732062,10.1371/journal.pgen.1006907,"The genetic factors that give rise to variation in susceptibility to environmental toxins remain largely unexplored. Studies on genetic variation in susceptibility to environmental toxins are challenging in human populations, due to the variety of clinical symptoms and difficulty in determining which symptoms causally result from toxic exposure; uncontrolled environments, often with exposure to multiple toxicants; and difficulty in relating phenotypic effect size to toxic dose, especially when symptoms become manifest with a substantial time lag. Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model that enables genome-wide studies for the identification of allelic variants that contribute to variation in susceptibility to environmental toxins, since the genetic background, environmental rearing conditions and toxic exposure can be precisely controlled. Here, we used extreme QTL mapping in an outbred population derived from the D. melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel to identify alleles associated with resistance to lead and/or cadmium, two ubiquitous environmental toxins that present serious health risks. We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with variation in resistance to both heavy metals as well as SNPs associated with resistance specific to each of them. The effects of these SNPs were largely sex-specific. We applied mutational and RNAi analyses to 33 candidate genes and functionally validated 28 of them. We constructed networks of candidate genes as blueprints for orthologous networks of human genes. The latter not only provided functional contexts for known human targets of heavy metal toxicity, but also implicated novel candidate susceptibility genes.

Transcriptional activation is a conserved feature of the early embryonic factor Zelda that requires a cluster of four zinc fingers for DNA binding and a low-complexity activation domain,25538246,10.1074/jbc.M114.602292,"Delayed transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome is a nearly universal phenomenon in metazoans. Immediately following fertilization, development is controlled by maternally deposited products, and it is not until later stages that widespread activation of the zygotic genome occurs. Although the mechanisms driving this genome activation are currently unknown, the transcriptional activator Zelda (ZLD) has been shown to be instrumental in driving this process in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we define functional domains of ZLD required for both DNA binding and transcriptional activation. We show that the C-terminal cluster of four zinc fingers mediates binding to TAGteam DNA elements in the promoters of early expressed genes. All four zinc fingers are required for this activity, and splice isoforms lacking three of the four zinc fingers fail to activate transcription. These truncated splice isoforms dominantly suppress activation by the full-length, embryonically expressed isoform. We map the transcriptional activation domain of ZLD to a central region characterized by low complexity. Despite relatively little sequence conservation within this domain, ZLD orthologs from Drosophila virilis, Anopheles gambiae, and Nasonia vitripennis activate transcription in D. melanogaster cells. Transcriptional activation by these ZLD orthologs suggests that ZLD functions through conserved interactions with a protein cofactor(s). We have identified distinct DNA-binding and activation domains within the critical transcription factor ZLD that controls the initial activation of the zygotic genome.",2015,"Danielle C Hamm, Eliana R Bondra, Melissa M Harrison, Danielle C Hamm, Eliana R Bondra, Melissa M Harrison"
Genome-wide association study of sleep in Drosophila melanogaster,23617951,10.1186/1471-2164-14-281,"Background:
      
    

    
      Sleep is a highly conserved behavior, yet its duration and pattern vary extensively among species and between individuals within species. The genetic basis of natural variation in sleep remains unknown.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We used the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) to perform a genome-wide association (GWA) study of sleep in D. melanogaster. We identified candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with differences in the mean as well as the environmental sensitivity of sleep traits; these SNPs typically had sex-specific or sex-biased effects, and were generally located in non-coding regions. The majority of SNPs (80.3%) affecting sleep were at low frequency and had moderately large effects. Additive models incorporating multiple SNPs explained as much as 55% of the genetic variance for sleep in males and females. Many of these loci are known to interact physically and/or genetically, enabling us to place them in candidate genetic networks. We confirmed the role of seven novel loci on sleep using insertional mutagenesis and RNA interference.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We identified many SNPs in novel loci that are potentially associated with natural variation in sleep, as well as SNPs within genes previously known to affect Drosophila sleep. Several of the candidate genes have human homologues that were identified in studies of human sleep, suggesting that genes affecting variation in sleep are conserved across species. Our discovery of genetic variants that influence environmental sensitivity to sleep may have a wider application to all GWA studies, because individuals with highly plastic genotypes will not have consistent phenotypes.",2013,"Susan T Harbison, Lenovia J McCoy, Trudy F C Mackay, Susan T Harbison, Lenovia J McCoy, Trudy F C Mackay"
Conserved regions of the timeless (tim) clock gene in Drosophila analyzed through phylogenetic and functional studies,9504927,,"Circadian (approximately 24-hr) rhythms in Drosophila melanogaster depend upon cyclic expression of the period (per) and timeless (tim) genes, which encode interacting components of the endogenous clock. The per gene has been isolated from other insects and, more recently, a per ortholog was found in mammals where its expression oscillates in a circadian fashion. We report here the complete sequence of a tim gene from another species, Drosophila virilis. TIM is better conserved than the PER protein is between these two species (76 vs. 54% overall amino acid identity), and putative functional domains, such as the PER interaction domains and the nuclear localization signal, are highly conserved. The acidic domain and the cytoplasmic localization domain, however, are within the least conserved regions. In addition, the initiating methionine in the D. virilis gene lies downstream of the proposed translation start for the original D. melanogaster tim cDNA and corresponds to the one used by D. simulans and D. yakuba. Among the most conserved parts of TIM is a region of unknown function near the N terminus. We show here that deletion of a 32 amino acid segment within this region affects rescue of rhythms in arrhythmic tim01 flies. Flies carrying a full-length tim transgene displayed rhythms with approximately 24-hr periods, indicating that a fully functional clock can be restored in tim01 flies through expression of a tim transgene. Deletion of the segment mentioned above resulted in very long activity rhythms with periods ranging from 30.5 to 48 hr.",1998,"A Ousley, K Zafarullah, Y Chen, M Emerson, L Hickman, A Sehgal, A Ousley, K Zafarullah, Y Chen, M Emerson, L Hickman, A Sehgal"
Translational regulation of mammalian and Drosophila citric acid cycle enzymes via iron-responsive elements,8643505,10.1073/pnas.93.10.4925,"The posttranscriptional control of iron uptake, storage, and utilization by iron-responsive elements (IREs) and iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) provides a molecular framework for the regulation of iron homeostasis in many animals. We have identified and characterized IREs in the mRNAs for two different mitochondrial citric acid cycle enzymes. Drosophila melanogaster IRP binds to an IRE in the 5' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the iron-sulfur protein (Ip) subunit of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). This interaction is developmentally regulated during Drosophila embryogenesis. In a cell-free translation system, recombinant IRP-1 imposes highly specific translational repression on a reporter mRNA bearing the SDH IRE, and the translation of SDH-Ip mRNA is iron regulated in D. melanogaster Schneider cells. In mammals, an IRE was identified in the 5' untranslated regions of mitochondrial aconitase mRNAs from two species. Recombinant IRP-1 represses aconitase synthesis with similar efficiency as ferritin IRE-controlled translation. The interaction between mammalian IRPs and the aconitase IRE is regulated by iron, nitric oxide, and oxidative stress (H2O2), indicating that these three signals can control the expression of mitochondrial aconitase mRNA. Our results identify a regulatory link between energy and iron metabolism in vertebrates and invertebrates, and suggest biological functions for the IRE/IRP regulatory system in addition to the maintenance of iron homeostasis.",1996,"N K Gray, K Pantopoulos, T Dandekar, B A Ackrell, M W Hentze, N K Gray, K Pantopoulos, T Dandekar, B A Ackrell, M W Hentze"
Molecular Profiling of the Drosophila Antenna Reveals Conserved Genes Underlying Olfaction in Insects,31527046,10.1534/g3.119.400669,"Repellent odors are widely used to prevent insect-borne diseases, making it imperative to identify the conserved molecular underpinnings of their olfactory systems. Currently, little is known about the molecules supporting odor signaling beyond the odor receptors themselves. Most known molecules function in one of two classes of olfactory sensilla, single-walled or double-walled, which have differing morphology and odor response profiles. Here, we took two approaches to discover novel genes that contribute to insect olfaction in the periphery. We transcriptionally profiled Drosophila melanogaster amos mutants that lack trichoid and basiconic sensilla, the single-walled sensilla in this species. This revealed 187 genes whose expression is enriched in these sensilla, including pickpocket ion channels and neuromodulator GPCRs that could mediate signaling pathways unique to single-walled sensilla. For our second approach, we computationally identified 141 antennal-enriched (AE) genes that are more than ten times as abundant in D. melanogaster antennae as in other tissues or whole-body extracts, and are thus likely to play a role in olfaction. We identified unambiguous orthologs of AE genes in the genomes of four distantly related insect species, and most identified orthologs were expressed in the antenna of these species. Further analysis revealed that nearly half of the 141 AE genes are localized specifically to either single or double-walled sensilla. Functional annotation suggests the AE genes include signaling molecules and enzymes that could be involved in odorant degradation. Together, these two resources provide a foundation for future studies investigating conserved mechanisms of odor signaling.",2019,"Pratyajit Mohapatra, Karen Menuz, Pratyajit Mohapatra, Karen Menuz"
Exposure to sodium molybdate results in mild oxidative stress in Drosophila melanogaster,28245708,10.1080/13510002.2017.1295898,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      The study was conducted to assess the redox status of Drosophila flies upon oral intake of insulin-mimetic salt, sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4).
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Oxidative stress parameters and activities of antioxidant and associated enzymes were analyzed in two-day-old D. melanogaster insects after exposure of larvae and newly eclosed adults to three molybdate levels (0.025, 0.5, or 10 mM) in the food.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Molybdate increased content of low molecular mass thiols and activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in males. The activities of these enzymes were not affected in females. Males exposed to molybdate demonstrated lower carbonyl protein levels than the control cohort, whereas females at the same conditions had higher carbonyl protein content and catalase activity than ones in the control cohort. The exposure to 10 mM sodium molybdate decreased the content of protein thiols in adult flies of both sexes. Sodium molybdate did not affect the activities of NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase and thioredoxin reductase in males or NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase in either sex at any concentration.

Diverse subcellular localizations of the insect CMP-sialic acid synthetases,27986833,10.1093/glycob/cww128,"The occurrence and biological importance of sialic acid (Sia) and its metabolic enzymes in insects have been studied using Drosophila melanogaster. The most prominent feature of D. melanogaster CMP-Sia synthetase (DmCSS) is its Golgi-localization, contrasted with nuclear localization of vertebrate CSSs. However, it remains unclear if the Golgi-localization is common to other insect CSSs and why it happens. To answer these questions, Aedes aegypti (mosquito) CSS (AaCSS) and Tribolium castaneum (beetle) CSS (TcCSS) were cloned and characterized for their activity and subcellular localization. Our new findings show: (1) AaCSS and TcCSS share a common overall structure with DmCSS in terms of evolutionarily conserved motifs and the absence of the C-terminal domain typical to vertebrate CSSs; (2) when expressed in mammalian and insect cells, AaCSS and TcCSS showed in vivo and in vitro CSS activities, similar to DmCSS. In contrast, when expressed in bacteria, they lacked CSS activity because the N-terminal hydrophobic region appeared to induce protein aggregation; (3) when expressed in Drosophila S2 cells, AaCSS and TcCSS were predominantly localized in the ER, but not in the Golgi. Surprisingly, DmCSS was mainly secreted into the culture medium, although partially detected in Golgi. Consistent with these results, the N-terminal hydrophobic regions of AaCSS and TcCSS functioned as a signal peptide to render them soluble in the ER, while the N-terminus of DmCSS functioned as a membrane-spanning region of type II transmembrane proteins whose cytosolic KLK sequence functioned as an ER export signal. Accordingly, the differential subcellular localization of insect CSSs are distinctively more diverse than previously recognized.",2017,"Wu Di, Akiko Fujita, Kayo Hamaguchi, Philippe Delannoy, Chihiro Sato, Ken Kitajima, Wu Di, Akiko Fujita, Kayo Hamaguchi, Philippe Delannoy, Chihiro Sato, Ken Kitajima"
Mitochondrial-Nuclear Interactions Mediate Sex-Specific Transcriptional Profiles in Drosophila,27558138,10.1534/genetics.116.192328,"The assembly and function of mitochondria require coordinated expression from two distinct genomes, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA). Mutations in either genome can be a source of phenotypic variation, yet their coexpression has been largely overlooked as a source of variation, particularly in the emerging paradigm of mitochondrial replacement therapy. Here we tested how the transcriptome responds to mtDNA and nDNA variation, along with mitonuclear interactions (mtDNA × nDNA) in Drosophila melanogaster We used two mtDNA haplotypes that differ in a substantial number of single nucleotide polymorphisms, with >100 amino acid differences. We placed each haplotype on each of two D. melanogaster nuclear backgrounds and tested for transcription differences in both sexes. We found that large numbers of transcripts were differentially expressed between nuclear backgrounds, and that mtDNA type altered the expression of nDNA genes, suggesting a retrograde, trans effect of mitochondrial genotype. Females were generally more sensitive to genetic perturbation than males, and males demonstrated an asymmetrical effect of mtDNA in each nuclear background; mtDNA effects were nuclear-background specific. mtDNA-sensitive genes were not enriched in male- or female-limited expression space in either sex. Using a variety of differential expression analyses, we show the responses to mitonuclear covariation to be substantially different between the sexes, yet the mtDNA genes were consistently differentially expressed across nuclear backgrounds and sexes. Our results provide evidence that the main mtDNA effects can be consistent across nuclear backgrounds, but the interactions between mtDNA and nDNA can lead to sex-specific global transcript responses.",2016,"Jim A Mossman, Jennifer G Tross, Nan Li, Zhijin Wu, David M Rand, Jim A Mossman, Jennifer G Tross, Nan Li, Zhijin Wu, David M Rand"

      Transposons, i.e. transposable elements (TEs), are the major internal spontaneous mutation agents for the variability of eukaryotic genomes. To address the general issue of whether transposons mediate genomic changes in environment-adaptation genes, we scanned two alleles per each of the six xenobiotic-metabolizing Helicoverpa zea cytochrome P450 loci, including CYP6B8, CYP6B27, CYP321A1, CYP321A2, CYP9A12v3 and CYP9A14, for the presence of transposon insertions by genome walking and sequence analysis. We also scanned thirteen Drosophila melanogaster P450s genes for TE insertions by in silico mapping and literature search.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Twelve novel transposons, including LINEs (long interspersed nuclear elements), SINEs (short interspersed nuclear elements), MITEs (miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements), one full-length transib-like transposon, and one full-length Tcl-like DNA transpson, are identified from the alleles of the six H. zea P450 genes. The twelve transposons are inserted into the 5'flanking region, 3'flanking region, exon, or intron of the six environment-adaptation P450 genes. In D. melanogaster, seven out of the eight Drosophila P450s (CYP4E2, CYP6A2, CYP6A8, CYP6A9, CYP6G1, CYP6W1, CYP12A4, CYP12D1) implicated in insecticide resistance are associated with a variety of transposons. By contrast, all the five Drosophila P450s (CYP302A1, CYP306A1, CYP307A1, CYP314A1 and CYP315A1) involved in ecdysone biosynthesis and developmental regulation are free of TE insertions.

Dosage compensation of a retina-specific gene in Drosophila miranda,1706975,10.1007/BF00418246,"The X1R chromosome of Drosophila miranda and the 3L autosome of Drosophila melanogaster are thought to have originated from the ancestral D chromosomal element and therefore may contain the same set of genes. It is expected that these genes will be dosage compensated in D. miranda because of their X linkage. To test these possibilities and to study evolution of the dosage compensation mechanism, we used the 3L-linked autosomal head-specific gene 507 ml of D. melanogaster to isolate the homologous gene (507mr) from a D. miranda genomic library. In situ hybridization showed that gene 507 is located at the 12A region of the X1R chromosome of D. miranda, indicating that the chromosomal homology deduced by cytogenetic means is correct. Restriction analysis and cross-specific DNA and RNA blot hybridization revealed the presence of extensive restriction pattern polymorphism and lack of sequence similarity in some areas of the 507mr and 507 ml DNA, including the 3' portion of the transcribed region. However, the 5' portion of the transcribed region and the DNA sequences, located approximately 0.8 kb upstream and 3 kb downstream from the 507 ml gene showed a high degree of similarity with the DNA sequences of comparable regions of the 507mr gene. In both species gene 507 codes for a highly abundant 1.8 kb RNA which is expressed in the retina of the compound eye. Although in D. miranda the males have one and the females have two copies of the 507 gene, the steady-state levels of the 507 mRNA in both sexes were found to be similar, indicating that gene 507 is dosage compensated in D. miranda.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1991,"R Krishnan, K D Swanson, R Ganguly, R Krishnan, K D Swanson, R Ganguly"

Isolation and characterization of a Drosophila hydei histone DNA repeat unit,2109309,10.1093/nar/18.6.1573,"Histone genes in D. hydei are organized in tandemly repeated clusters., accomodating in total 120-140 repeat units. We cloned one of the repeat units and analysed the nucleotide sequence. The repeat unit has a size of 5.1 x 10(3) base-pairs and contains one copy of each of the genes coding for the core histones and one copy coding for the histone H1. In the promoter regions of the genes we identified the presumptive cap sites and TATA boxes. Two additional sequence elements are shared by all five Drosophila hydei histone genes in the cluster. The sequence CCCTCT/G1 is found in the region upstream of the presumptive CAP sites. The sequence element AGTGAA occurs downstream of the presumptive cap sites and is, in contrast to the promoter element, also seen in the histone genes of Drosophila melanogaster. Cell-cycle dependent regulation of transcription of the Drosophila histone genes may be different from that in other eukaryotes since sequence elements involved in the regulation of cell-cycle dependent transcription are absent. Also other regulatory elements for transcription differ from those of other genes. The highly conserved H1-specific promoter sequence AAACACA and the H2B specific promoter sequence ATTTGCAT, which are involved in the cell-cycle dependent transcription of those histone genes in eukaryotes, are missing in the Drosophila genes. However at the 3' end of the genes the palindrome and the purine-rich region, both conserved sequence elements in histone genes of eukaryotes, are present. The spacer regions show a simple sequence organization. The silent site substitution rate between the coding regions of the D. hydei and D. melanogaster histone genes is at least 1.5 times higher for Drosophila than for sea urchin histone genes.",1990,"H Kremer, W Hennig, H Kremer, W Hennig"

An integrated hybrid microfluidic device for oviposition-based chemical screening of adult Drosophila melanogaster,26768402,10.1039/c5lc01517k,"Chemical screening using Drosophila melanogaster (the fruit fly) is vital in drug discovery, agricultural, and toxicological applications. Oviposition (egg laying) on chemically-doped agar plates is an important read-out metric used to quantitatively assess the biological fitness and behavioral responses of Drosophila. Current oviposition-based chemical screening studies are inaccurate, labor-intensive, time-consuming, and inflexible due to the manual chemical doping of agar. In this paper, we have developed a novel hybrid agar-polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device for single- and multi-concentration chemical dosing and on-chip oviposition screening of free-flying adult stage Drosophila. To achieve this, we have devised a novel technique to integrate agar with PDMS channels using ice as a sacrificial layer. Subsequently, we have conducted single-chemical toxicity and multiple choice chemical preference assays on adult Drosophila melanogaster using zinc and acetic acid at various concentrations. Our device has enabled us to 1) demonstrate that Drosophila is capable of sensing the concentration of different chemicals on a PDMS-agar microfluidic device, which plays significant roles in determining oviposition site selection and 2) investigate whether oviposition preference differs between single- and multi-concentration chemical environments. This device may be used to study fundamental and applied biological questions in Drosophila and other egg laying insects. It can also be extended in design to develop sophisticated and dynamic chemical dosing and high-throughput screening platforms in the future that are not easily achievable with the existing oviposition screening techniques.",2016,"Jacob C K Leung, Arthur J Hilliker, Pouya Rezai, Jacob C K Leung, Arthur J Hilliker, Pouya Rezai"
Production of reactive oxygen species by the mitochondrial electron transport chain in Drosophila melanogaster,20300811,10.1007/s10863-010-9281-z,"Mitochondrial free radicals and in particular mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species (mtROS) are considered to be totally or partially responsible for several different diseases including Parkinson, diabetes or cancer. Even more importantly, mtROS have also been proposed as the main driving force behind the aging process. Thus, in the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the role of free radicals as signalling molecules. Collectively this makes understanding mechanisms controlling free radical production extremely important. There is extensive published literature on mammalian models (essentially rat, mouse and guinea pig) however; this is not the case in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila is an excellent model to study different physiological and pathological processes. Additionally a robust method to study mtROS is extremely useful. In the present article, we describe a simple--but extremely sensitive--method to study mtROS production in Drosophila. We have performed various experiments to determine which specific respiratory complexes produce free radicals in the electron transport chain of Drosophila melanogaster. Complex I is the main generator of ROS in Drosophila mitochondria, leaking electrons either in the forward or reverse direction. The production of ROS during reverse electron transport can be prevented either by rotenone or by the oxidation of NADH by complex I. These results clearly show that Drosophila mitochondria function in a very similar way to mammalian mitochondria, and therefore are a very relevant experimental model for biochemical studies related to ageing.",2010,"Alberto Sanz, Rhoda Stefanatos, George McIlroy, Alberto Sanz, Rhoda Stefanatos, George McIlroy"
"Expression of a beetle, Dendroides canadensis, antifreeze protein in Drosophila melanogaster",16828791,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2006.05.009,"Antifreeze protein 1 (DAFP-1), from the beetle Dendroides canadensis, was expressed in Drosophila melanogaster. Mean thermal hysteresis values (the difference between freezing and melting points), indicative of antifreeze protein activity, in the hemolymph of transgenic flies were found to be as high as 6.23+/-0.10 degrees C (using the nanoliter osmometer). Direct comparisons of the capillary and nanoliter osmometer techniques for measuring THA were made, illustrating the much higher values obtained by the latter. Transgenic Drosophila had supercooling points, both in contact with ice and not, that were slightly, but significantly, lower than wild-type controls (1.5-2.0 degrees C and 2.0-4.0 degrees C, respectively). The results indicate functionality of DAFP-1 in Drosophila melanogaster (the ability of DAFP-1 to inhibit both inoculative freezing across the cuticle and freezing initiated by endogenous ice nucleators). The much larger effects of DAFPs in inhibiting inoculative freezing and ice nucleation in Dendroides canadensis relative to the transgenic Drosophila may partially result from the lower DAFP concentrations and activities in Drosophila, however the absence of multiple types of DAFPs and absence of tissue specific expression may also contribute. Transgenic Drosophila were also able to live significantly longer than controls at 0 degrees C and 4 degrees C, indicating that DAFP-1 is able to increase cold tolerance at above freezing temperatures.",2006,"Jessie Nicodemus, Joseph E O'tousa, John G Duman, Jessie Nicodemus, Joseph E O'tousa, John G Duman"

A 412 family was thus composed of heterogeneous copies of different sizes, with a large proportion of full-size copies. D. simulans had more rearranged copies than D. melanogaster, with some specific copies, such as a 5.6-kb BsrBI fragment, present in all populations of D. simulans.

Genetic and biochemical aspects of trehalase from Drosophila melanogaster,105719,10.1007/BF00483744,"Only one molecular form of trehalase (E.C. 3.2.1.28) was detectable in adult Drosophila melanogaster by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. An examination of duplication- and deletion-bearing aneuploids exhibiting dosage sensitivity indicated that the enzyme is encoded by a gene, Treh+, located between 55B and 55E of the second chromosome. The tissue-specific soluble and particulate forms of trehalase appear to be manifestations of a single protein encoded by a single gene.",1978,"M J Oliver, R E Huber, J H Williamson, M J Oliver, R E Huber, J H Williamson"

Genomics of clinal variation in Drosophila: disentangling the interactions of selection and demography,26919307,10.1111/mec.13534,"Clines in phenotypes and genotype frequencies across environmental gradients are commonly taken as evidence for spatially varying selection. Classical examples include the latitudinal clines in various species of Drosophila, which often occur in parallel fashion on multiple continents. Today, genomewide analysis of such clinal systems provides a fantastic opportunity for unravelling the genetics of adaptation, yet major challenges remain. A well-known but often neglected problem is that demographic processes can also generate clinality, independent of or coincident with selection. A closely related issue is how to identify true genic targets of clinal selection. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, three studies illustrate these challenges and how they might be met. Bergland et al. report evidence suggesting that the well-known parallel latitudinal clines in North American and Australian D. melanogaster are confounded by admixture from Africa and Europe, highlighting the importance of distinguishing demographic from adaptive clines. In a companion study, Machado et al. provide the first genomic comparison of latitudinal differentiation in D. melanogaster and its sister species D. simulans. While D. simulans is less clinal than D. melanogaster, a significant fraction of clinal genes is shared between both species, suggesting the existence of convergent adaptation to clinaly varying selection pressures. Finally, by drawing on several independent sources of evidence, Božičević et al. identify a functional network of eight clinal genes that are likely involved in cold adaptation. Together, these studies remind us that clinality does not necessarily imply selection and that separating adaptive signal from demographic noise requires great effort and care.",2016,"Thomas Flatt, Thomas Flatt"

"Impact of Probiotic Combination in InR[E19]/TM2 Drosophila melanogaster on Longevity, Related Gene Expression, and Intestinal Microbiota: A Preliminary Study",32664584,10.3390/microorganisms8071027,"The insulin receptor (InR) pertains to the insulin receptor family, which plays a key role in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-like signaling (IIS) pathway. Insulin signaling defects may result in the development of metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, and the InR mutant has been suggested to bear insulin signaling deficiency. Numerous studies have reported that probiotics are beneficial for the treatment of diabetes; however, the effect of probiotics on patients with InR deficiency has seldom been reported. Therefore, we chose the InR[E19]/TM2 Drosophila melanogaster to investigate. The results indicated that probiotics significantly reduce the mean and median lifespan of InR[E19]/TM2 Drosophila (by 15.56% and 23.82%, respectively), but promote that of wild-type files (by 9.31% and 16.67%, respectively). Significant differences were obtained in the expression of lifespan- and metabolism-related genes, such as Imp-L2, Tor, and GstD2, between the standard diet groups and the probiotics groups. Furthermore, analysis of 16S rDNA via high throughput sequencing revealed that the gut bacterial diversity of Drosophila fed with a probiotic combination also differs from that of Drosophila fed with a standard diet. In summary, these findings indicate that a probiotic combination indeed affects InR[E19]/TM2 Drosophila, but not all of its impacts are positive.",2020,"Shuang Ma, Hao Sun, Weichao Yang, Mingfu Gao, Hui Xu, Shuang Ma, Hao Sun, Weichao Yang, Mingfu Gao, Hui Xu"
Lactobacillus probiotics improved the gut microbiota profile of a Drosophila melanogaster Alzheimer's disease model and alleviated neurodegeneration in the eye,32066253,10.3920/BM2019.0086,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive disease and one of the most common forms of neurodegenerative disorders. Emerging evidence is supporting the use of various strategies that modulate gut microbiota to exert neurological and psychological changes. This includes the utilisation of probiotics as a natural and dietary intervention for brain health. Here, we showed the potential AD-reversal effects of Lactobacillus probiotics through feeding to our Drosophila melanogaster AD model. The administration of Lactobacillus strains was able to rescue the rough eye phenotype (REP) seen in AD-induced Drosophila, with a more prominent effect observed upon the administration of Lactobacillus plantarum DR7 (DR7). Furthermore, we analysed the gut microbiota of the AD-induced Drosophila and found elevated levels of Wolbachia. The administration of DR7 restored the gut microbiota diversity of AD-induced Drosophila with a significant reduction in Wolbachia's relative abundance, accompanied by an increase of Stenotrophomonas and Acetobacter. Through functional predictive analyses, Wolbachia was predicted to be positively correlated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases, while Stenotrophomonas was negatively correlated with these neurodegenerative disorders. Altogether, our data exhibited DR7's ability to ameliorate the AD effects in our AD-induced Drosophila. Thus, we propose that Wolbachia be used as a potential biomarker for AD.",2020,"F H P Tan, G Liu, S-Y A Lau, M H Jaafar, Y-H Park, G Azzam, Y Li, M-T Liong, F H P Tan, G Liu, S-Y A Lau, M H Jaafar, Y-H Park, G Azzam, Y Li, M-T Liong"
Evolutionary and functional analysis of the tailless enhancer in Musca domestica and Drosophila melanogaster,16409378,10.1111/j.1525-142X.2006.05070.x,"To further understand the evolutionary dynamics of the regulatory interactions underlying development, we expand on our previous analysis of hunchback and compare the structure and function of the tailless enhancer between Musca domestica and Drosophila melanogaster. Our analysis shows that although the expression patterns and functional protein domains of tll are conserved between Musca and Drosophila, the enhancer sequences are unalignable. Upon closer investigation, we find that these highly diverged enhancer sequences encode the same regulatory information necessary for Bicoid, Dorsal, and the terminal system to drive tll expression. The binding sites for these transcription factors differ in the sequence, number, spacing, and position between the Drosophila and Musca tll enhancers, and we were unable to establish homology between binding sites from each species. This implies that the Musca and Drosophila Bcd-binding sites have evolved de novo in the 100 million years since these species diverged. However, in transgenic Drosophila embryos the Musca tll enhancer is able to drive the same expression pattern as endogenous Drosophila tll. Therefore, during the rapid evolution of enhancer sequences individual binding sites are continually lost and gained, but the transcriptional output is maintained by compensatory mutations in cis and in trans.",2006,"Naomi S Wratten, Alistair P McGregor, Philip J Shaw, Gabriel A Dover, Naomi S Wratten, Alistair P McGregor, Philip J Shaw, Gabriel A Dover"
