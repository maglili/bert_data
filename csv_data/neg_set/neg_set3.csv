DNA repair defects and other (mus)takes in Drosophila melanogaster,10454999,10.1006/meth.1999.0797,"Preservation of the structural integrity of DNA in any organism is crucial to its health and survival. Such preservation is achieved by an extraordinary cellular arsenal of damage surveillance and repair functions, many of which are now being defined at the gene and protein levels. Mutants hypersensitive to the killing effects of DNA-damaging agents have been instrumental in helping to identify DNA repair-related genes and to elucidate repair mechanisms. In Drosophila melanogaster, such strains are generally referred to as mutagen-sensitive (mus) mutants and currently define more than 30 genetic loci. Whereas most mus mutants have been recovered on the basis of hypersensitivity to the monofunctional alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate, they nevertheless constitute a phenotypically diverse group, with many mutants having effects beyond mutagen sensitivity. These phenotypes include meiotic dysfunctions, somatic chromosome instabilities, chromatin abnormalities, and cell proliferation defects. Within the last few years numerous mus and other DNA repair-related genes of Drosophila have been molecularly cloned, providing new insights into the functions of these genes. This article outlines strategies for isolating mus mutations and reviews recent advances in the Drosophila DNA repair field, emphasizing mutant analysis and gene cloning.",1999,"D S Henderson, D S Henderson"
Precise excision and transposition of piggyBac in pink bollworm embryos,9927180,10.1046/j.1365-2583.1999.810119.x,"Transposable elements such as P, hobo, Hermes, mariner and Minos have been successfully harnessed as gene vectors to achieve the transformation of several dipteran species including Drosophila melanogaster, Ceratitis capitata and Aedes aegypti. Plasmid-based excision and transposition assays have been useful indicators of an element's ability to be mobilized in vivo and thus potentially serve as a transforming vector. We report that the transposable element piggyBac is capable of precise excision and transposition in the pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella), a worldwide pest of cultivated cotton. Combined with a suitable marker gene, the piggyBac element may serve as a vector for germline transformation in this and (potentially) other lepidopteran species.",1999,"S T Thibault, H T Luu, N Vann, T A Miller, S T Thibault, H T Luu, N Vann, T A Miller"
Smell and taste perception in Drosophila melanogaster larva: toxin expression studies in chemosensory neurons,10414987,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.19-15-06599.1999,"GAL4-driven targeted expression of tetanus toxin light chain (UAS-TeTxLC) in a subset of chemosensory neurons of the larval antennomaxillary complex (AMC) and pharynx causes abnormal chemosensory behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. Consistent with strongest staining in the dorsal organ (DO), the presumed olfactory organ of the AMC, tetanus toxin-expressing larvae subjected to an olfactory preference assay show anosmic behavior to most volatile substances tested. Furthermore, we observed reduced responses to sodium chloride, fructose, and sucrose in gustatory plate assays. Surprisingly, the entire subset of labeled sensory neurons from the terminal (maxillary) organ (TO) of the AMC was found to project via the antennal nerve to the larval antennal lobe region. The maxillary nerve remained completely unstained. Hence, a subset of neurons from the TO builds an anatomical entity with projections from the DO. Our results suggest that the AMC contains both olfactory and gustatory sensilla, and that the DO is the main olfactory organ in larvae.",1999,"G Heimbeck, V Bugnon, N Gendre, C HÃ¤berlin, R F Stocker, G Heimbeck, V Bugnon, N Gendre, C HÃ¤berlin, R F Stocker"
Mitochondrial small ribosomal RNA is present on polar granules in early cleavage embryos of Drosophila melanogaster,10466937,10.1046/j.1440-169x.1999.00451.x,"In Drosophila, formation of the germline progenitors, the pole cells, is induced by polar plasm localized in the posterior pole region of early embryos. The polar plasm contains polar granules, which act as a repository for the factors required for pole cell formation. It has been postulated that the factors are stored as mRNA and are later translated on polysomes attached to the surface of polar granules. Here, the identification of mitochondrial small ribosomal RNA (mtsrRNA) as a new component of polar granules is described. The mtsrRNA was enriched in the polar plasm of the embryos immediately after oviposition and remained in the polar plasm throughout the cleavage stage until pole cell formation. In situ hybridization at an ultrastructural level revealed that mtsrRNA was enriched on the surface of polar granules in cleavage embryos. Furthermore, the localization of mtsrRNA in the polar plasm depended on the normal function of oskar, vasa and tudor genes, which are all required for pole cell formation. The temporal and spatial distribution of mtsrRNA is essentially identical to that of mitochondrial large ribosomal RNA (mtlrRNA), which has been shown to be required for pole cell formation. Taken together, it is speculated that mtsrRNA and mtlrRNA are part of the translation machinery localized to polar granules, which is essential for pole cell formation.",1999,"M Kashikawa, R Amikura, A Nakamura, S Kobayashi, M Kashikawa, R Amikura, A Nakamura, S Kobayashi"
Comparative analysis of promoters for transient gene expression in cultured mosquito cells,9927172,10.1046/j.1365-2583.1999.810031.x,"Three heterologous promoters (hsp70 and actin 5C from Drosophila melanogaster and IE1 from the immediate early gene of the Bombyx mori baculovirus) were assessed for their ability to drive transient luciferase expression in mosquito cells. Overall, the actin 5C promoter was considerably more effective at driving luciferase expression than either hsp70 or IE1 in cell lines derived from Anopheles, Aedes and Culex species. hsp70 functioned well when induced by heat shock and was also induced to a lesser extent by chemicals such as sodium arsenite. IE1 was also an effective initiator of transcription, particularly in two Anopheles cell lines, but generally it performed less well than the actin 5C promoter and was also outperformed by hsp70 in Anopheles gambiae cells.",1999,"Y G Zhao, P Eggleston, Y G Zhao, P Eggleston"
Genetic analysis of temperature-dependent transmission of mitochondrial DNA in Drosophila,10383676,10.1038/sj.hdy.6885080,"In artificially induced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy in Drosophila, the effects of chromosome substitution on temperature-dependent selection in mtDNA transmission were investigated. Using two strains of D. melanogaster, bw;e11 and y;bw;st, which showed a different temperature dependency in mtDNA transmission, chromosomes were substituted reciprocally, and mtDNA of D. mauritiana was introduced into each newly constructed strain. For each heteroplasmy, the transmission of mtDNA was examined at 25 degrees C and 19 degrees C. When either the second or the third chromosome of the y;bw;st strain was substituted with that of the bw;e11 strain, the temperature-dependent selection in mtDNA transmission was altered. The selection was not changed when either the second or the third chromosome of the bw;e11 strain was substituted with that of the y;bw;st strain, or even when both the second and the third chromosomes of the bw;e11 strain were substituted with those of the y;bw;st strain.

Octopamine inhibits synaptic transmission at the larval neuromuscular junction in Drosophila melanogaster,10433989,10.1016/s0006-8993(99)01676-5,"The effect of octopamine, a biogenic amine, on synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in first instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster was examined using the patch clamp technique. Muscle cells were voltage-clamped at -60 mV in the whole-cell configuration, and nerve-evoked excitatory junctional currents (EJCs) and miniature excitatory junctional currents (MEJCs) were recorded. Octopamine significantly decreased the mean amplitude of nerve-evoked EJCs in a dose-dependent manner and increased the failure rate. However, the mean amplitude and amplitude distribution of MEJCs were not affected by octopamine. These results suggest that octopamine is acting presynaptically. This effect was abolished by pretreatment with the octopamine receptor blocker, yohimbine. On the other hand, octopamine significantly decreased the decay time constant of MEJCs from 6.0+/-0.3 ms (mean+/-S.E., n=16) to 4.2+/-0.3 ms (n=14) (p<0.001), which might be the effect on the kinetic properties of junctional glutamate receptor channels. However, the mean open time of extrajunctional glutamate receptor channels was not changed by octopamine.

FLP recombinase-mediated induction of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase transgene expression can extend the life span of adult Drosophila melanogaster flies,9858546,10.1128/mcb.19.1.216,"Yeast FLP recombinase was used in a binary transgenic system (""FLP-OUT"") to allow induced overexpression of catalase and/or Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/ZnSOD) in adult Drosophila melanogaster. Expression of FLP recombinase was driven by the heat-inducible hsp70 promoter. Once expressed, FLP catalyzed the rearrangement and activation of a target construct in which expression of catalase or Cu/ZnSOD cDNAs was driven by the constitutive actin5C promoter. In this way a brief heat pulse (120 or 180 min, total) of young adult flies activated transgene expression for the rest of the life span. FLP-OUT allows the effects of induced transgene expression to be analyzed in control (no heat pulse) and experimental (heat pulse) populations with identical genetic backgrounds. Under the conditions used, the heat pulse itself always had neutral or slightly negative effects on the life span. Catalase overexpression significantly increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide but had neutral or slightly negative effects on the mean life span. Cu/ZnSOD overexpression extended the mean life span up to 48%. Simultaneous overexpression of catalase with Cu/ZnSOD had no added benefit, presumably due to a preexisting excess of catalase. The data suggest that oxidative damage is one rate-limiting factor for the life span of adult Drosophila. Finally, experimental manipulation of the genetic background demonstrated that the life span is affected by epistatic interactions between the transgene and allele(s) at other loci.",1999,"J Sun, J Tower, J Sun, J Tower"

Linkage disequilibrium mapping of molecular polymorphisms at the scabrous locus associated with naturally occurring variation in bristle number in Drosophila melanogaster,10689806,10.1017/s001667239900419x,"We evaluated the hypothesis that the Drosophila melanogaster second chromosome gene scabrous (sca), a candidate sensory bristle number quantitative trait locus (QTL), contributes to naturally occurring variation in bristle number. Variation in abdominal and sternopleural bristle number was quantified for wild-derived sca alleles in seven genetic backgrounds: as homozygous second chromosomes (C2) in an isogenic background, homozygous lines in which approximately 20 cM including the sca locus had been introgressed into the isogenic background (sca BC), as C2 and sca BC heterozygotes and hemizygotes against a P element insertional sca allele and a P-induced sca deficiency in the same isogenic background, and as sca BC heterozygotes against the wild-type sca allele of isogenic strain. Molecular restriction map variation was determined for a 45 kb region including the sca locus, and single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) was examined for the third intron and parts of the third and fourth exons. Associations between each of the 27 molecular polymorphisms and bristle number were evaluated within each genotype and on the first principal component score determined from all seven genotypes, separately for each sex and bristle trait. Permutation tests were used to assess the empirical significance thresholds, accounting for multiple, correlated tests, and correlated markers. Three sites in regulatory regions were associated with female-specific variation in abdominal bristle number, one of which was an SSCP site in the region of the gene associated with regulation of sca in embryonic abdominal segments.",1999,"R F Lyman, C Lai, T F MacKay, R F Lyman, C Lai, T F MacKay"
Molecular analysis of mutants obtained by treatment with alkylating agents in a quadruplicated white-ivory strain of Drosophila melanogaster,10229920,10.1093/mutage/14.2.187,"The use of a white-ivory (wi) strain of Drosophila melanogaster carrying four copies of this allele, (wi)4, has proved to be useful in detecting somatic mutation in genotoxicity testing. Nevertheless, until now very little information exists about the nature of the genetic effects detected in such a strain. This work presents molecular data on the changes that have taken place in different germinal mutants obtained after treatment with alkylating agents. Three different phenotypes were obtained: wild-type red eyes, dark red eyes and eyes lighter than (wi)4. Our results show that, in at least one of the four copies of the allele, the wild-type red eye phenotypes are due to a precise excision of the 2.96 kb duplicated region characteristic of the wi allele. These data agree with previous results obtained in a strain carrying only a single copy of the wi allele. The dark red eye mutants analysed seemed to be generated as a cluster and all proved to be caused by deletions at the 3'-end of the duplicated wi region in two of the copies of the (wi)4 genome. Finally, the light eye mutants (obtained at high frequencies) failed to show alterations at the molecular level, although we cannot discard the possibility that they might have originated by the loss of some of the wi copies of the (wi)4 strain.",1999,"S SuÃ¡rez, O CabrÃ©, A VelÃ¡zquez, R Marcos, N Xamena, S SuÃ¡rez, O CabrÃ©, A VelÃ¡zquez, R Marcos, N Xamena"
Microsatellite instability in Drosophila spellchecker1 (MutS homolog) mutants,10077620,10.1073/pnas.96.6.2964,"We have cloned a mutS homolog from Drosophila melanogaster called spellchecker1 (spel1) and have constructed spel1 mutant flies.

The spel1 gene belongs to a subfamily of mutS first characterized by the MSH2 gene of yeast and which also includes hMSH2, one of the two major hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer loci of humans. Like msh2 mutants in other species, we find that flies lacking the spel1 gene suffer a highly increased rate of instability in long runs of dinucleotide repeats when analyzed after 10-12 fly generations. Using a new assay, we have also discovered that mutations in spel1 decrease the stability of a dinucleotide repeat when it is copied into the site of a double-strand break during gene conversion. Contrary to the case in mammalian cells, spel1 deficiency does not affect tolerance of flies to a methylating agent nor does it affect resistance to gamma-irradiation.",1999,"C Flores, W Engels, C Flores, W Engels"

The aim of this study was to investigate their linkage to the sperm plasma membrane. We verified that glycosidases are not peripherally adsorbed to the cell surface by evaluating their resistance to release by KI, by buffered salt solutions of high ionic strength or alkaline buffers. Glycosidases were released from the sperm surface by detergents and, only to a minor extent, by mild proteolysis. Differential detergent solubilization pointed out that Triton X-114 was the most effective releasing agent for GlcNAc'ase and CHAPS for mannosidase. No activity was released from the membrane by a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). The released forms were quite hydrophilic in phase separation experiments with Triton X-114. This finding indicates the presence of a hydrophobic domain limited to a single transmembrane helix or/and the presence of an extensive glycosylation. The use of a Con-A binding assay demonstrated that both the enzymes are glycosylated. The molecular weight of the released glycosidases estimated by gel filtration was 158 kDa for GlcNAc'ase and 317 kDa for mannosidase. These results suggest that Drosophila melanogaster GlcNAc'ase and mannosidase are mannosylated integral membrane proteins that would function as exoenzymes with their active sites accessible in the extracellular space.",1999,"M E Pasini, F Cattaneo, M R Pinto, R De Santis, M E Perotti, M E Pasini, F Cattaneo, M R Pinto, R De Santis, M E Perotti"

After induction of DNA damage with 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) in the wild-type parental males, quantitative and qualitative differences in the AP-PCR fingerprints were detected between the two crosses, and the estimate of the genomic damage detected by AP-PCR has clearly shown that the mus-201 repair deficiency is associated with an increase of genomic damage. The predominant type of alterations detected by AP-PCR under the mus-201 repair-deficient conditions agree with the results obtained in microsatellite PCR analysis, suggesting that the role of the mus-201 gene, necessary in excision repair, is not associated to the mismatch repair process.

The Dras1 gene, which is the major ras homologue in Drosophila, has less within-species variation in D. melanogaster relative to the amount of divergence from the sibling species than does Dras2, although the contrast was not significant by the HKA test. Dras2 appears to be maintaining two classes of haplotype in D. melanogaster, one of which is closer to the alleles observed in the sibling species, suggesting that this is not likely to be a pseudogene despite the absence of a mutant phenotype.

"minifly, a Drosophila gene required for ribosome biogenesis",10087258,10.1083/jcb.144.6.1123,"We report here the genetic, molecular, and functional characterization of the Drosophila melanogaster minifly (mfl) gene. Genetic analysis shows that mfl is essential for Drosophila viability and fertility. While P-element induced total loss-of-function mutations cause lethality, mfl partial loss-of-function mutations cause pleiotropic defects, such as extreme reduction of body size, developmental delay, hatched abdominal cuticle, and reduced female fertility. Morphological abnormalities characteristic of apoptosis are found in the ovaries, and a proportion of eggs laid by mfl mutant females degenerates during embryogenesis. We show that mfl encodes an ubiquitous nucleolar protein that plays a central role in ribosomal RNA processing and pseudouridylation, whose known eukaryotic homologues are yeast Cfb5p, rat NAP57 and human dyskerin, encoded by the gene responsible for the X-linked dyskeratosis congenita disease. mfl genetic analysis represents the first in vivo functional characterization of a member of this highly conserved gene family from higher eukaryotes. In addition, we report that mfl hosts an intron encoded box H/ACA snoRNA gene, the first member of this class of snoRNAs identified so far from Drosophila.",1999,"E Giordano, I Peluso, S Senger, M Furia, E Giordano, I Peluso, S Senger, M Furia"
Partial sweeping of variation at the Fbp2 locus in a west African population of Drosophila melanogaster,10331261,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026115,"Departure of molecular variation from neutral equilibrium was studied in a highly recombining region of the Drosophila genome. A 2.2-kb region including the Fbp2 locus was sequenced for 10 chromosomes from a D. melanogaster sample from West Africa and for the related species D. simulans. Of the 33 variable sites present in the 1.3-kb transcription unit, 32 made up a single haplotype present in half of the D. melanogaster sample. This pattern significantly departed from predictions of the neutral drift-mutation equilibrium model. The major haplotype presented a diagnostic restriction site which was investigated in 226 chromosomes from three distant European and African populations. It was found at a high frequency (31%) in the population from which the sequenced sample originated, but was nearly absent from the other two (below 4%), suggesting that the major haplotype frequency resulted from a local selective sweep event. Partial sweeping of variation in regions of high recombination rates has previously been found for American and European populations of D. melanogaster. Our study shows that this phenomenon also occurs in African populations, which are in the ancestral range of this species.",1999,"V BÃ©nassi, F Depaulis, G K Meghlaoui, M Veuille, V BÃ©nassi, F Depaulis, G K Meghlaoui, M Veuille"
Functional analysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in Drosophila melanogaster,10331645,,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is conserved in eukaryotes. To analyze the function of PARP, we isolated and characterized the gene for PARP in Drosophila melanogaster. The PARP gene consisted of six translatable exons and spanned more than 50 kb. The DNA binding domain is encoded by exons 1-4. Although the consensus cleavage site of CED-3 like protease during apoptosis is conserved from human to Xenopus laevis PARPs, it is neither conserved in the corresponding region of Drosophila nor Sarcophaga peregrina. There are two cDNAs species in Drosophila. One cDNA could encode the full length PARP protein (PARP I), while the other is a truncated cDNA which could encode a partial-length PARP protein (PARP II), which lacks the automodification domain and is possibly produced by alternative splicing. The expression of these two forms of PARP in E. coli demonstrated that while PARP II has the catalytic NAD-binding domain and DNA-binding domain it is enzymatically inactive. On the other hand PARP I is active. A deletion mutant of PARP gene could grow to the end of embryogenesis but did not grow to the adult fly. These results suggest that the PARP gene plays an important function during the development of Drosophila.",1999,"M Miwa, S Hanai, P Poltronieri, M Uchida, K Uchida, M Miwa, S Hanai, P Poltronieri, M Uchida, K Uchida"

A delta 9 desaturase gene with a different substrate specificity is responsible for the cuticular diene hydrocarbon polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster,10920187,10.1073/pnas.150243997,"Drosophila melanogaster cuticular pheromones consist of unsaturated hydrocarbons with at least one double bond in position 7: 7 tricosene (T) in males and 7,11 heptacosadiene (HD) in females. However, in many African populations like the Tai strain, females possess low levels of 7,11 HD and high levels of its positional isomer 5,9 HD. We have previously isolated a desaturase gene, desat1, from the Canton-S strain (CS), a 7,11 HD-2-rich morph of D. melanogaster. This desaturase is located in 87C, a locus that has been involved in the difference between 7,11 HD and 5,9 HD morphs. Therefore, we have searched for different desaturase isoforms in both strains. We first cloned desat1 in the Tai strain and report here functional expression of desat1 in CS and Tai. In both strains, the Desat1 enzymes have the same Delta9 specificity and preferentially use palmitate as a substrate, leading to the synthesis of omega7 fatty acids. Also found was a desaturase sequence, named desat2, with a homologous catalytic domain and a markedly different N-terminal domain compared with desat1. In CS genome, it lies 3.8 kb upstream of desat1 and is not transcribed in either sex. In the Tai strain, it is expressed only in females and acts preferentially on myristate, leading to the synthesis of omega5 fatty acids. We suggest, therefore, that desat2 might play a control role in the biosynthesis of 5,9 HD hydrocarbons in Tai females and could explain the dienic hydrocarbon polymorphism in D. melanogaster.",2000,"R Dallerac, C Labeur, J M Jallon, D C Knipple, W L Roelofs, C Wicker-Thomas, R Dallerac, C Labeur, J M Jallon, D C Knipple, W L Roelofs, C Wicker-Thomas"
Single channel analysis of the blocking actions of BIDN and fipronil on a Drosophila melanogaster GABA receptor (RDL) stably expressed in a Drosophila cell line,10952672,10.1038/sj.bjp.0703507,"Single channel recordings were obtained from a Drosophila S2 cell line stably expressing the wild-type RDL(ac) Drosophila melanogaster homomer-forming ionotropic GABA receptor subunit, a product of the resistance to dieldrin gene, RDL: GABA (50 microM) was applied by pressure ejection to outside-out patches from S2-RDL cells at a holding potential of -60 mV. The resulting inward current was completely blocked by 100 microM picrotoxin (PTX). The unitary current-voltage relationship was linear at negative potentials but showed slight inward rectification at potentials more positive than 0 mV. The reversal potential of the current (E(GABA)=-1.4 mV) was close to the calculated chloride equilibrium potential. The single channel conductance elicited by GABA was 36 pS. A 71 pS conductance channel was also observed when the duration of the pulse, used to eject GABA, was longer than 80 ms. The mean open time distribution of the unitary events was fitted best by two exponential functions suggesting two open channel states. When either 1 microM fipronil or 1 microM BIDN was present in the external saline, the GABA-gated channels were completely blocked. When BIDN or fipronil was applied at a concentration close to the IC(50) value for suppression of open probability (281 nM, BIDN; 240 nM, fipronil), the duration of channel openings was shortened. In addition, the blocking action of BIDN resulted in the appearance of a novel channel conductance (17 pS). The effects of co-application of BIDN and fipronil were examined. Co-application of BIDN (300 nM) with various concentrations (100-1000 nM) of fipronil resulted in an additional BIDN-induced dose-dependent reduction of the maximum P(o) value. Thus both BIDN and fipronil shorten the duration of wild-type RDL(ac) GABA receptor channel openings but appear to act at distinct sites.",2000,"F Grolleau, D B Sattelle, F Grolleau, D B Sattelle"
Functional expression of a multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase from Drosophila melanogaster and its C-terminal deletion mutants,10692477,10.1074/jbc.275.9.6673,"The occurrence of a deoxyribonucleoside kinase in Drosophila melanogaster (Dm-dNK) with remarkably broad substrate specificity has recently been indicated (Munch-Petersen, B., Piskur, J., and SÃ¸ndergaard, L.

To prove that the capacity to phosphorylate all four deoxyribonucleosides is in fact associated to one polypeptide chain, partially sequenced cDNA clones, originating from the Berkeley Drosophila genome sequencing project, were searched for homology with human deoxyribonucleoside kinases. The total sequence of one cDNA clone and the corresponding genomic DNA was determined and expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The purified and thrombin cleaved recombinant protein phosphorylated the four deoxyribonucleosides with high turnover and K(m) values similar to those of the native Dm-dNK, as well as the four ribonucleosides and many therapeutical nucleoside analogs. Dm-dNK has apparently the same origin as the mammalian kinases, thymidine kinase 2, deoxycytidine kinase, deoxyguanosine kinase, and the herpes viral thymidine kinases, but it has a unique C terminus that seems to be important for catalytic activity and specificity. The C-terminal 20 amino acids were dispensable for phosphorylation of deoxyribonucleosides but necessary for full activity with purine ribonucleosides. Removal of the C-terminal 20 amino acids increased the specific activity 2-fold, but 99% of the activity was lost after removal of the C-terminal 30 amino acids.",2000,"B Munch-Petersen, W Knecht, C Lenz, L SÃ¸ndergaard, J Piskur, B Munch-Petersen, W Knecht, C Lenz, L SÃ¸ndergaard, J Piskur"

The segregation of phenotypes with different rescue success adjusts to the action of a single, dominant, zygotic-acting gene involved in hybrid female viability. This gene, which we named 'Simulans hybrid females rescue' (Shfr), is temperature-sensitive, showing a much smaller effect as temperature increases. Reciprocal crosses between Tel Aviv and a nonrescue population indicate some influence of cytoplasm or maternal effect in rescue. Using a chromosome substitution analysis we have located Shfr on the second chromosome. Using synthetic lines with this chromosome having different segments from Tel Aviv and from a multimarker strain we have mapped Shfr between black (2 L-43. 0) and pearly (2 R-74.0).",2000,"M C Carracedo, A Asenjo, P Casares, M C Carracedo, A Asenjo, P Casares"
Evolutionary interactions between Drosophila melanogaster and its parasitoid Asobara tabida,11122423,10.1046/j.1365-2540.2000.00788.x,"Drosophila melanogaster is attacked by parasitoids that develop internally in the larva. They can defend themselves by a cellular immune response (host resistance), although this can be disabled by parasitoid countermeasures (parasitoid virulence). D. melanogaster and its parasitoids are an excellent system in which to study coevolution experimentally. We designed an experiment to compare changes in resistance and virulence in replicate populations of flies and parasitoids maintained together for approximately 10 fly (five parasitoid) generations. The experiment had three treatments each with three replicates: (A) no parasitoids (B) outbred parasitoids (C) partially inbred parasitoids. Host resistance increased in treatments B and C but there was no difference between these treatments. Parasitoid virulence appeared not to change during the experiment. Host larvae in treatments B and C fed at lower rates than those in A, evidence of a trade-off between resistance and larval competitive ability. We found no evidence for local adaptation, as hosts from the different replicates of treatment C performed no differently against parasitoids from the same and other replicates. Also, we found no evidence for the evolution of behavioural traits in the host that could lead to lower probabilities of being attacked. Comparing the evolution of host resistance in these seminatural settings with that in artificial selection experiments provides insight into how the conflicting selection pressures on host resistance interact.",2000,"D M Green, A R Kraaijeveld, H C Godfray, D M Green, A R Kraaijeveld, H C Godfray"

Titin is a giant sarcomeric protein responsible for the elasticity of striated muscle. Titin may also function as a molecular scaffold during myofibril assembly.

Assays of D. pseudoobscura and populations of its sibling species, D. persimilis, using 10 of these loci show extremely high levels of variation compared with similar studies of dinucleotide repeat variation in D. melanogaster populations. The high levels of variation are consistent with an average mutation rate of approximately 10(-6) per locus per generation and an effective population size of D. pseudoobscura approximately four times larger than that of D. melanogaster. Consistent with allozymes and nucleotide sequence polymorphism, the dinucleotide repeat loci reveal minimal structure across four populations of D. pseudoobscura.

A novel activation mechanism of caspase-activated DNase from Drosophila melanogaster,10777599,10.1074/jbc.275.17.12978,"Caspase-activated DNase (CAD) is an enzyme that cleaves chromosomal DNA in apoptotic cells. Here, we identified a DNase in Drosophila Schneider cells that can be activated by caspase 3, and purified it as a complex of two subunits (p32 and p20). Using primers based on the amino acid sequence of the purified proteins, a cDNA coding for Drosophila CAD (dCAD) was cloned. The polypeptide encoded by the cDNA contained 450 amino acids with a calculated M(r) of 52,057, and showed significant homology with human and mouse CAD (22% identity). Mammalian CADs carry a nuclear localization signal at the C terminus. In contrast, dCAD lacked the corresponding sequence, and the purified dCAD did not cause DNA fragmentation in nuclei in a cell-free system. When dCAD was co-expressed in COS cells with Drosophila inhibitor of CAD (dICAD), a 52-kDa dCAD was produced as a heterotetrameric complex with dICAD. When the complex was treated with human caspase 3 or Drosophila caspase (drICE), the dICAD was cleaved, and released from dCAD. In addition, dCAD was also cleaved by these caspases, and behaved as a (p32)(2)(p20)(2) complex in gel filtration. When a Drosophila neuronal cell line was induced to apoptosis by treatment with a kinase inhibitor, both dCAD and dICAD were cleaved. These results indicated that unlike mammalian CAD, Drosophila CAD must be cleaved by caspases to be activated.",2000,"H Yokoyama, N Mukae, H Sakahira, K Okawa, A Iwamatsu, S Nagata, H Yokoyama, N Mukae, H Sakahira, K Okawa, A Iwamatsu, S Nagata"

We also show that the TAA repeats are not required for transposition and that I elements containing mutations affecting the TAA sequences generate transposed copies ending with tandem repeats of various types. Our results suggest that during integration the 3' end of the I factor RNA template can pair with nucleotides at the target site and that tandem duplications are generated by the reverse transcriptase of the I factor in a manner that is reminiscent of the activity of the reverse transcriptases of telomerases.

Mutational analysis of a histone deacetylase in Drosophila melanogaster: missense mutations suppress gene silencing associated with position effect variegation,10655219,,"For many years it has been noted that there is a correlation between acetylation of histones and an increase in transcriptional activity. One prediction, based on this correlation, is that hypomorphic or null mutations in histone deacetylase genes should lead to increased levels of histone acetylation and result in increased levels of transcription. It was therefore surprising when it was reported, in both yeast and fruit flies, that mutations that reduced or eliminated a histone deacetylase resulted in transcriptional silencing of genes subject to telomeric and heterochromatic position effect variegation (PEV). Here we report the first mutational analysis of a histone deacetylase in a multicellular eukaryote by examining six new mutations in HDAC1 of Drosophila melanogaster. We observed a suite of phenotypes accompanying the mutations consistent with the notion that HDAC1 acts as a global transcriptional regulator. However, in contrast to recent findings, here we report that specific missense mutations in the structural gene of HDAC1 suppress the silencing of genes subject to PEV.

Our results show that the wild-type product of Hmr is neither necessary nor sufficient for hybrid embryonic inviability. Hmr(mel) does, however, appear to lower the viability of hybrid larvae. The data further suggest (though do not prove) that Hmr(mel) acts as a gain-of-function poison in hybrids.

Extensive amino acid polymorphism at the pgm locus is consistent with adaptive protein evolution in Drosophila melanogaster,11102370,,"PGM plays a central role in the glycolytic pathway at the branch point leading to glycogen metabolism and is highly polymorphic in allozyme studies of many species. We have characterized the nucleotide diversity across the Pgm gene in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans to investigate the role that protein polymorphism plays at this crucial metabolic branch point shared with several other enzymes. Although D. melanogaster and D. simulans share common allozyme mobility alleles, we find these allozymes are the result of many different amino acid changes at the nucleotide level. In addition, specific allozyme classes within species contain several amino acid changes, which may explain the absence of latitudinal clines for PGM allozyme alleles, the lack of association of PGM allozymes with the cosmopolitan In(3L)P inversion, and the failure to detect differences between PGM allozymes in functional studies. We find a significant excess of amino acid polymorphisms within D. melanogaster when compared to the complete absence of fixed replacements with D. simulans. There is also strong linkage disequilibrium across the 2354 bp of the Pgm locus, which may be explained by a specific amino acid haplotype that is high in frequency yet contains an excess of singleton polymorphisms.

Evidence for stabilizing selection in a eukaryotic enhancer element,10676967,10.1038/35000615,"Eukaryotic gene expression is mediated by compact cis-regulatory modules, or enhancers, which are bound by specific sets of transcription factors.

Although even-skipped stripe 2 expression is strongly conserved in Drosophila, the stripe 2 element itself has undergone considerable evolutionary change in its binding-site sequences and the spacing between them. We have investigated this apparent contradiction, and here we show that two chimaeric enhancers, constructed by swapping the 5' and 3' halves of the native stripe 2 elements of two species, no longer drive expression of a reporter gene in the wildtype pattern. Sequence differences between species have functional consequences, therefore, but they are masked by other co-evolved differences.

Olfactory coding in a simple system: adaptation in Drosophila larvae,11416918,10.1098/rspb.2000.1258,"Drosophila melanogaster larvae were pre-stimulated with high concentrations of six homologous alcohols (C4-C9) and then tested for adaptation and cross-adaptation using these same alcohols, four aliphatic n-acetates and three acids. Pre-stimulation with hexanol effectively reduced to zero (abolished) test responses to all six alcohols, whereas test responses to hexanol were only affected by pre-stimulation with hexanol. This substance appears to play a fundamental role in the organization of the larval olfactory system. Test responses to butanol and pentanol, and the effect of pre-stimulation with butanol and pentanol, were not significantly different, indicating that they are sensory equivalents. Heptanol, octanol and nonanol induce a complex set of responses among one another. Cross-adaptation between functional groups was observed, in particular following pre-stimulation with hexanol, but there was also evidence that functional groups are coded separately. A model of olfactory processing in the fruitfly maggot is presented that explains the data and provides predictions for future anatomical, genetic and electrophysiological studies.",2000,"M Cobb, I Domain, M Cobb, I Domain"

The extensive genetic and molecular information about this region in D. melanogaster makes it a prime choice for comparative studies of genomic organization among distantly related species. A set of 26 P1 phages from D. melanogaster were successfully hybridized using fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) to the salivary gland chromosomes of both repleta group species. The results show that the Adh region is distributed in D. repleta and D. buzatii over six distant sites of chromosome 3, homologous to chromosomal arm 2L of D. melanogaster (Muller's element B). This observation implies a density of 2.57 fixed breakpoints per Mb in the Adh region and suggests a considerable reorganization of this chromosomal element via the fixation of paracentric inversions. Nevertheless, breakpoint density in the Adh region is three times lower than that estimated for D. repleta chromosome 2, homologous to D. melanogaster 3R (Muller's element E).

Sequence and expression of the kettin gene in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans,10669599,10.1006/jmbi.1999.3461,"Kettin is a large modular protein associated with thin filaments in the Z-disc region of insect muscles. The sequence of a 21.3 kb contig of the Drosophila gene has been determined. The corresponding protein sequence has 35 immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains which are separated by shorter linker sequences, except near the N and C termini of the molecule where linker sequences are short or missing. This confirms a model in which each Ig domain binds to an actin protomer. The Drosophila kettin gene is at 62C 1-3 on the third chromosome. Two P-element insertions, l(3)j1D7 and l(3)rL182 are in the kettin gene, and complementation tests showed that existing l(3)dre8 mutations are in the same gene. The RNA was detected in wild-type Drosophila embryos at stage 11, first in the gut invagination region of the mesoderm, and by stage 13 in both visceral and somatic mesoderm. Somatic mesoderm expression became segmental at stage 13. RNA expression was greatly reduced in embryos of P-element homozygotes but normal in heterozygotes. The structure of the flight muscle in all the heterozygous mutants was normal, including the myofibril-cuticle connections, and they were able to fly. Kettin sequence homologous to the Drosophila protein, was identified in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome database. The RNA was detected in pharyngeal, body wall and anal depressor muscles of larvae and adult worms, as well as in the male gonad. Antibody to insect kettin labelled the pharyngeal, body wall, anal depressor and proximal gonadal muscles in adult worms. Body wall muscles were labelled in an obliquely striated pattern consistent with the Z-disc localisation in insect muscle.

Quantitative developmental genetic analysis reveals that the ancestral dipteran wing vein prepattern is conserved in Drosophila melanogaster,11151298,10.1007/s004270000107,"Quantitative complementation tests provide a quick test of the hypothesis that a particular gene contributes to segregating phenotypic variation. A set of wild-type alleles is assayed for variation in their ability to complement the degree of dominance of the quantitative effect of a loss of function allele. Analysis of 15 loci known to be involved in wing patterning in Drosophila melanogaster suggests that the genes decapentaplegic, thickveins, EGFR, argos and hedgehog, each of which are involved in secreted growth factor signaling, may contribute to wing shape variation. The phenotype of one deficiency, Df(2R)Px2, which removes blistered/Plexate, is also highly sensitive to the wild-type genetic background and at intermediate expressivity reveals six ectopic veins. These form in the same locations as a projection of the ancestral pattern of dipteran wing veins on- to the D. melanogaster wing. This atavistic phenotype indicates that the wing vein prepatterning mechanism can be conserved in highly derived species, and implies that homoplasic venation patterns may be produced by derepression of vein primordia.",2000,"A Palsson, G Gibson, A Palsson, G Gibson"

To clarify the function of these mammalian homologs, we deleted GCMa in mice. Genetic ablation of murine GCMa (mGCMa) is embryonic lethal, with mice dying between 9.5 and 10 days postcoitum. At the time of death, no abnormalities were apparent in the embryo proper. Nervous system development, in particular, was not impaired, as might have been expected in analogy to Drosophila GCM. Instead, placental failure was the cause of death. In agreement with the selective expression of mGCMa in labyrinthine trophoblasts, mutant placentas did not develop a functional labyrinth layer, which is necessary for nutrient and gas exchange between maternal and fetal blood. Only a few fetal blood vessels entered the placenta, and these failed to thrive and branch normally. Labyrinthine trophoblasts did not differentiate. All other layers of the placenta, including spongiotrophoblast and giant cell layer, formed normally. Our results indicate that mGCMa plays a critical role in trophoblast differentiation and the signal transduction processes required for normal vascularization of the placenta.",2000,"J Schreiber, E Riethmacher-Sonnenberg, D Riethmacher, E E Tuerk, J Enderich, M R BÃ¶sl, M Wegner, J Schreiber, E Riethmacher-Sonnenberg, D Riethmacher, E E Tuerk, J Enderich, M R BÃ¶sl, M Wegner"

Ectopic G-protein expression in dopamine and serotonin neurons blocks cocaine sensitization in Drosophila melanogaster,10704417,10.1016/s0960-9822(00)00340-7,"Sensitization to repeated doses of psychostimulants is thought to be an important component underlying the addictive process in humans [1] [2] [3] [4]. In all vertebrate animal models, including humans [5], and even in fruit flies, sensitization is observed after repeated exposure to volatilized crack cocaine [6]. In vertebrates, sensitization is thought to be initiated by processes occurring in brain regions that contain dopamine cell bodies [2] [7]. Here, we show that modulated cell signaling in the Drosophila dopamine and serotonin neurons plays an essential role in cocaine sensitization. Targeted expression of either a stimulatory (Galpha(s)) or inhibitory (Galpha(i)) Galpha subunit, or tetanus toxin light chain (TNT) in dopamine and serotonin neurons of living flies blocked behavioral sensitization to repeated cocaine exposures. These flies showed alterations in their initial cocaine responsiveness that correlated with compensatory adaptations of postsynaptic receptor sensitivity. Finally, repeated drug stimulation of a nerve cord preparation that is postsynaptic to the brain amine cells failed to induce sensitization, further showing the importance of presynaptic modulation in sensitization.",2000,"H Li, S Chaney, I J Roberts, M Forte, J Hirsh, H Li, S Chaney, I J Roberts, M Forte, J Hirsh"

Cellular basis of wing size variation in Drosophila melanogaster: a comparison of latitudinal clines on two continents,10762404,10.1046/j.1365-2540.2000.00677.x,"We investigated the cellular basis of two extensive, continuous, latitudinal, genetic, body size clines of Drosophila melanogaster by measuring wing area and cell size in the wing blade of adult flies reared under standard, laboratory conditions. We report that the contribution of cell size to an Australian cline is much smaller than that to a South American cline. The data suggest that neither cell size nor cell number were the targets of selection, but rather wing area itself, or a trait closely related to it. We hypothesize that the differences between the continents were caused by differences in the initial pattern of genetic variation for the cell traits and/or by the direction of selection on the source populations of the clines. Despite large differences between continents in the cellular basis of the latitudinal variation, multiple regression analysis, using the individual variation within populations, showed that the relationship between cell size and cell number was changed with latitude in the same way in the two clines. The relative contribution of cell number to wing area variation increased with latitude, probably because of compensatory interactions with cell size as a consequence of the latitudinal increase in cell number. Our findings are discussed in relation to the cellular basis of evolutionary change in laboratory thermal selection lines and natural populations along latitudinal clines.",2000,"B J Zwaan, R B Azevedo, A C James, J Van 't Land, L Partridge, B J Zwaan, R B Azevedo, A C James, J Van 't Land, L Partridge"
Genetic analysis of a La homolog in Drosophila melanogaster,10666446,10.1093/nar/28.5.1078,"People afflicted with certain rheumatological auto-immune diseases produce autoantibodies directed against a select group of proteins such as the La auto-antigen. Biochemical studies have revealed La to be a promiscuous RNA-binding protein that appears to play a role in a variety of intracellular activities such as processing and/or transport of RNA polymerase III precursor transcripts and translational regulation from internal ribosome entry sites (IRES). We have previously identified an RNA-binding protein that is a Drosophila melanogaster homolog of La (D-La) and shown that early transcript accumulation throughout the embryo is later refined to be most prevalent in the visceral mesoderm, gut, gonads and salivary glands. Here we report the first in vivo genetic characterization of a La homolog in a multicellular eukaryote. Lethality was observed in homozygous larvae harboring a small chromosomal deletion that removed the D-La gene, which was rescued by an inducible D-La cDNA transgene. This implies that D-La confers essential functions for larval development. In addition, loss of D-La function gives rise to defects in embryonic midgut morphogenesis; one of the midgut defects correlates with loss of Ultrabithorax ( Ubx ) expression along the second midgut constriction. Finally, genetic interactions between chromosomal deficiencies that remove D-La and certain Ubx alleles were demonstrated in adults. Our results support the hypothesis that D-La provides essential functions for proper Drosophila development and imply that the conserved La family of proteins may perform critical developmental functions in higher eukaryotes.",2000,"C Bai, P P Tolias, C Bai, P P Tolias"

The mean repeat unit length of microsatellite clones in D. subobscura is 15, higher than that observed in other Drosophila species. Population variation was assayed in 32-40 chromosomes from Barcelona, Spain, using 18 randomly chosen microsatellite loci. Positive correlation between measures of variation and perfect repeat length measures (mean size, most common, and longest allele) is consistent with a higher mutation rate in loci with longer repeat units. Levels of microsatellite variation measured as variance in repeat number and heterozygosity in D. subobscura were similar to those of Drosophila pseudoobscura and higher than those of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans. Our data suggest that higher levels of microsatellite variation, and possibly density, in D. subobscura compared with D. melanogaster are due to both a higher average effective population and a higher intrinsic slippage rate in the former species.",2000,"M Pascual, M D Schug, C F Aquadro, M Pascual, M D Schug, C F Aquadro"
A misexpression screen identifies genes that can modulate RAS1 pathway signaling in Drosophila melanogaster,11063696,,"Differentiation of the R7 photoreceptor cell is dependent on the Sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase, which activates the RAS1/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade. Kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) functions genetically downstream of RAS1 in this signal transduction cascade. Expression of dominant-negative KSR (KDN) in the developing eye blocks RAS pathway signaling, prevents R7 cell differentiation, and causes a rough eye phenotype. To identify genes that modulate RAS signaling, we screened for genes that alter RAS1/KSR signaling efficiency when misexpressed. In this screen, we recovered three known genes, Lk6, misshapen, and Akap200. We also identified seven previously undescribed genes; one encodes a novel rel domain member of the NFAT family, and six encode novel proteins. These genes may represent new components of the RAS pathway or components of other signaling pathways that can modulate signaling by RAS.

Chromosomally-induced meiotic drive in Drosophila males: checkpoint or fallout?,11293801,10.1023/a:1026544402411,"In male Drosophila melanogaster, anomalies in sex chromosome pairing at meiosis often lead to complete or partial sperm dysfunction. This observation has led to the suggestion that defects in either the efficiency or configuration of chromosome pairing at metaphase trigger a checkpoint mechanism that leads to the elimination of meiotic products. Here, we discuss this model in consideration of recent observations on the conservation of metaphase checkpoint components in male meiosis, and on the phenotype of new alleles of the male-specific meiotic mutant teflon. Based on these observations, we propose an alternative hypothesis for the cause of sperm dysfunction in cases of chromosomal sterility and drive. We suggest that disruption of the prophase compartmentalization of sex chromatin, rather than abnormal pairing at metaphase, may be the causative defect. Such disruption may occur as a result of perturbations in sex chromosome pairing, or by translocations involving autosomal and sex chromatin. We discuss how this hypothesis may account for previously described examples chromosomal causes of meiotic drive and sterility in Drosophila.",2000,"J E Tomkiel, J E Tomkiel"

The chromocenters of homozygous cells had an abnormal structure. There was no meiotic block in metaphase 1, and chromosomes only segregated equally in about 80% of anaphases of the first meiotic division. The data obtained correspond to the abnormal variants of the formation of the chromocenter in c(3)G/c(3)G females that could be predicted based on the two-ring structure of the chromocenter. The mechanism of the effect of the homo- and heterozygosity for the hypomorphic mutation c(3)G on the formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC) and crossing over frequency was suggested. In nod/nod homozygous females, asynapsis of pericentromeric regions of homologs was observed in the chromocenter.

While wing shape also exhibits significant epistatic genetic variance, there was no indication of directional selection, suggesting instead a history of optimizing selection.

Extension of the Drosophila lifespan by overexpression of a protein repair methyltransferase,11742076,10.1073/pnas.251446498,"Atypical protein isoaspartyl residues arise spontaneously during the aging process from the deamidation of protein asparaginyl residues and the isomerization of protein aspartyl residues. These abnormal residues are modified in cells by a strongly conserved protein carboxyl methyltransferase (PCMT) as a first step in a repair pathway. Because a decline in cellular repair mechanisms is hypothesized to contribute to senescence, we determined whether increased PCMT activity was correlated with enhanced longevity. Two ubiquitous promoters were used with the binary GAL4-UAS system to drive PCMT overexpression in Drosophila melanogaster. Flies expressing PCMT activity under the regulation of either the hsp70 or actin5C promoter had enzyme activities that were 3- or 7-fold higher, respectively, than control flies at 29 degrees C. Correlated with the observed increases in PCMT activities, such flies lived on average 32-39% longer than control flies. Lifespan extension was not observed at 25 degrees C with either hsp70- or actin5C-driven expression, indicating a temperature-dependent effect on longevity. We conclude that protein repair is an important factor in the determination of lifespan under certain environmental conditions.

Recombination and the frequency spectrum in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,11230530,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003805,"Most ""tests of neutrality"" assess whether particular data sets depart from the predictions of a standard neutral model with no recombination. For Drosophila, where nuclear polymorphism data routinely show evidence of genetic exchange, the assumption of no recombination is often unrealistic. In addition, while conservative, this assumption is made at the cost of a great loss in power. Perhaps as a result, tests of the frequency spectrum based on zero recombination suggest an adequate fit of Drosophila polymorphism data to the predictions of the standard neutral model. Here, we analyze the frequency spectrum of a large number of loci in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans using two summary statistics. We use an estimate of the population recombination rate based on a laboratory estimate of the rate of crossing over per physical length and an estimate of the species' effective population size. In contrast to previous studies, we find that roughly half of the loci depart from the predictions of the standard neutral model. The extent of the departure depends on the exact recombination rate, but the global pattern that emerges is robust. Interestingly, these departures from neutral expectations are not unidirectional. The large variance in outcomes may be due to a complex demographic history and inconsistent sampling, or to the pervasive action of natural selection.",2001,"M Przeworski, J D Wall, P Andolfatto, M Przeworski, J D Wall, P Andolfatto"

In a series of interspecific backcrosses, 11 genetic markers were used to map factors affecting egg-to-adult ('larval') resistance in D. sechellia. The third chromosome harbours at least one partially dominant resistance factor. The second chromosome carries at least two mostly dominant resistance factors but no recessive factors. However, neither the X chromosome--which contains 20% of D. sechellia's genome--nor the fourth chromosome appear to affect resistance.

"Genetic evidence for adaptation-driven incipient speciation of Drosophila melanogaster along a microclimatic contrast in ""Evolution Canyon,"" Israel",11687637,10.1073/pnas.231478298,"Substantial genetic differentiation, as great as among species, exists between populations of Drosophila melanogaster inhabiting opposite slopes of a small canyon. Previous work has shown that prezygotic sexual isolation and numerous differences in stress-related phenotypes have evolved between D. melanogaster populations in ""Evolution Canyon,"" Israel, in which slopes 100-400 m apart differ dramatically in aridity, solar radiation, and associated vegetation. Because the canyon's width is well within flies' dispersal capabilities, we examined genetic changes associated with local adaptation and incipient speciation in the absence of geographical isolation. Here we report remarkable genetic differentiation of microsatellites and divergence in the regulatory region of hsp70Ba which encodes the major inducible heat shock protein of Drosophila, in the two populations. Additionally, an analysis of microsatellites suggests a limited exchange of migrants and lack of recent population bottlenecks. We hypothesize that adaptation to the contrasting microclimates overwhelms gene flow and is responsible for the genetic and phenotypic divergence between the populations.",2001,"P Michalak, I Minkov, A Helin, D N Lerman, B R Bettencourt, M E Feder, A B Korol, E Nevo"
Microfluorometer assay to measure the expression of beta-galactosidase and green fluorescent protein reporter genes in single Drosophila flies,11252795,10.2144/01303rr04,"beta-galactosidase and green fluorescent protein (GFP) are among the most commonly used reporter genes to monitor gene expression in various organisms including Drosophila melanogaster. Their expression is usually detected in a qualitative way by direct microscopic observations of cells, tissues, or whole animals. To measure in vivo the inducibility of two antimicrobial peptide genes expressed during the Drosophila innate immune response, we have adapted two reporter gene systems based on the beta-galactosidase enzymatic activity and GFP. We have designed a 96-well microplate fluorometric assay sensitive enough to quantify the expression of both reporter genes in single flies. The assay has enabled us to process efficiently and rapidly a large number of individual mutant flies generated during an ethylmethane sulfonate saturation mutagenesis of the Drosophila genome.

The nonA gene in Drosophila conveys species-specific behavioral characteristics,11514445,,"The molecular basis of species-specific differences in courtship behavior, a critical factor in preserving species boundaries, is poorly understood. Genetic analysis of all but the most closely related species is usually impossible, given the inviability of hybrids. We have therefore applied interspecific transformation of a single candidate behavioral locus, no-on-transient A (nonA), between Drosophila virilis and D. melanogaster, to investigate whether nonA, like the period gene, might encode species-specific behavioral information. Mutations in nonA can disrupt both visual behavior and the courtship song in D. melanogaster. The lovesong of nonA(diss) mutant males superficially resembles that of D. virilis, a species that diverged from D. melanogaster 40-60 mya. Transformation of the cloned D. virilis nonA gene into D. melanogaster hosts carrying a synthetic deletion of the nonA locus restored normal visual function (the phenotype most sensitive to nonA mutation). However, the courtship song of transformant males showed several features characteristic of the corresponding D. virilis signal, indicating that nonA can act as a reservoir for species-specific information. This candidate gene approach, together with interspecific transformation, can therefore provide a direct avenue to explore potential speciation genes in genetically and molecularly tractable organisms such as Drosophila.",2001,"S Campesan, Y Dubrova, J C Hall, C P Kyriacou, S Campesan, Y Dubrova, J C Hall, C P Kyriacou"

In Drosophila melanogaster, Wolbachia frequencies vary clinically in frequency in Australia and may confound climatic adaptation. Here we use field cages in a reciprocal exchange design to test for Wolbachia effects in D. melanogaster in winter at temperate and tropical sites. Infected flies of both populations had a lower fecundity in tropical north Queensland, whilst in temperate southern Victoria Wolbachia effects depended on the nuclear population background. Here infected flies from Victoria were more fecund. Wolbachia also influenced larval/pupal viability in the tropics but this was dependent on population background. In comparisons of the populations, there was no evidence for local adaptation for total fecundity, viability or survival over winter. However, in Victoria, a local population had a higher late-life fecundity than a tropical population from Queensland that had higher early-life fecundity. At a tropical site, local Queensland flies had a higher early fecundity than Victorian flies. In contrast to many laboratory studies, mortality rates in the field cages increased only slightly over time. Both the Wolbachia effects and population differences have not been previously detected in laboratory studies with D. melanogaster and highlight the utility of Drosophila field studies in fitness experiments.",2001,"K Olsen, K T Reynolds, A A Hoffmann"
"The maternal effect gene, abnormal oocyte (abo), of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a specific negative regulator of histones",11593026,10.1073/pnas.211428798,"The abnormal oocyte (abo) gene of Drosophila melanogaster is a peculiar maternal effect gene whose mutations cause a maternal-effect lethality that can be rescued by specific regions of heterochromatin during early embryogenesis. Here we show that abo encodes an evolutionary conserved chromosomal protein that localizes exclusively to the histone gene cluster and binds to the regulatory regions of such genes. We also show a significant increase of histone transcripts in eggs of abo mutant mothers and a partial rescue of the abo maternal-effect defect by deficiencies of the histone gene cluster. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the Abo protein functions specifically as a negative regulator of histone transcription and propose a molecular model to account for the ability of heterochromatin to partially rescue the abo maternal-effect defect. Our model proposes that increased doses of specific heterochromatic regions titrate out abnormally high levels of histones present in embryos from mutant abo mothers and that a balanced pool of histones is critical for normal embryogenesis in Drosophila.",2001,"M Berloco, L Fanti, A Breiling, V Orlando, S Pimpinelli, M Berloco, L Fanti, A Breiling, V Orlando, S Pimpinelli"
The nucleotide changes governing cuticular hydrocarbon variation and their evolution in Drosophila melanogaster,11259658,10.1073/pnas.061465098,"The cuticular hydrocarbon (CH) pheromones in Drosophila melanogaster exhibit strong geographic variation. African and Caribbean populations have a high ratio of 5,9 heptacosadiene/7,11 heptacosadiene (the ""High"" CH type), whereas populations from all other areas have a low ratio (""Low"" CH type). Based on previous genetic mapping, DNA markers were developed that localized the genetic basis of this CH polymorphism to within a 13-kb region. We then carried out a hierarchical search for diagnostic nucleotide sites starting with four lines, and increasing to 24 and 43 lines from a worldwide collection. Within the 13-kb region, only one variable site shows a complete concordance with the CH phenotype. This is a 16-bp deletion in the 5' region of a desaturase gene (desat2) that was recently suggested to be responsible for the CH polymorphism on the basis of its expression [Dallerac, R., Labeur, C., Jallon, J.-M., Knipple, D.

"Time, love and species",11524627,,"Physiological and behavioral phenomena of many animals are restricted to certain times of the day. Many organisms show daily rhythms in their mating. The daily fluctuation in mating activity of a few insects is controlled by an endogenous clock. The fruitfly, Drosophila, is the most suitable material to characterize the genetic basis of circadian rhythms of mating because some mutants with defective core oscillator mechanism, feedback loops, have been isolated. D. melanogaster wild-type display a robust circadian rhythm in the mating activity, and the rhythms are abolished in period or timeless null mutant flies (per(01) and tim(01)), the rhythms are generated by females but not males. Disconnected (disco) mutants which have a severe defect in the optic lobe and are missing lateral neurons show arrhythmicity in mating activities. Thus, the lateral neurons seem to be essential for the circadian rhythm in mating activity of Drosophila. Furthermore, an anti-phasic relation in circadian rhythms of the mating activity was detected between D. melanogaster and their sibling species D. simulans. The Queensland fruit flies or wild gypsy moth also show species-specific mating rhythm, suggesting that species-specific circadian rhythms in mating activity of insect appear to cause a reproductive isolation.",2001,"T Sakai, N Ishida, T Sakai, N Ishida"
The production of elevated flight force compromises manoeuvrability in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,11171345,,"In this study, we have investigated how enhanced total flight force production compromises steering performance in tethered flying fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster. The animals were flown in a closed-loop virtual-reality flight arena in which they modulated total flight force production in response to vertically oscillating visual patterns. By simultaneously measuring stroke amplitude and stroke frequency, we recorded the ability of each fly to modulate its wing kinematics at different levels of aerodynamic force production. At a flight force that exactly compensates body weight, the temporal deviations with which fruit flies vary their stroke amplitude and frequency are approximately 2.7 degrees and 4.8 Hz of their mean value, respectively. This variance in wing kinematics decreases with increasing flight force production, and at maximum force production fruit flies are restricted to a unique combination of stroke amplitude, stroke frequency and mean force coefficient. This collapse in the kinematic envelope during peak force production could greatly attenuate the manoeuvrability and stability of animals in free flight.",2001,"F O Lehmann, M H Dickinson, F O Lehmann, M H Dickinson"

Evolution of the integrin alpha and beta protein families,11139295,10.1007/s002390010134,"A phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate and invertebrate alpha integrins supported the hypothesis that two major families of vertebrate alpha integrins originated prior to the divergence of deuterostomes and protostomes. These two families include, respectively, the alpha PS1 and alpha PS2 integrins of Drosophila melanogaster, and each family has duplicated repeatedly in vertebrates but not in Drosophila. In contrast, a third family (including alpha PS3) has duplicated in Drosophila but is absent from vertebrates. Vertebrate alpha PS1 and alpha PS2 family members are found on human chromosomes 2, 12, and 17. Linkage of these family members may have been conserved since prior to the origin of vertebrates, and the two genes duplicated simultaneously. A phylogenetic analysis of beta integrins did not clearly resolve whether vertebrate beta integrin genes duplicated prior to the origin of vertebrates, although it suggested that at least the gene encoding vertebrate beta 4 may have done so. In general, the phylogeny of neither alpha nor beta integrins showed a close correspondence with patterns of alpha--beta heterodimer formation or other functional characteristics. One major exception to this trend involved alpha L, alpha M, alpha X, and alpha D, a monophyletic group of immune cell-expressed alpha integrins, which share a number of common functional characteristics and have evolved in coordinated fashion with their beta integrin partners.",2001,"A L Hughes, A L Hughes"

The rapidity of the response suggested that mutation accumulation could not account for it. Rather, resistance to environmental stresses appeared to be lost as a correlated response to selection on another trait, such as early fertility, with which stress resistance is negatively genetically correlated. These results suggest that caution is needed when extrapolating from evolution of stress resistance in long-established laboratory stocks to patterns of responses and correlated responses in natural populations.",2001,"A A Hoffmann, R Hallas, C Sinclair, L Partridge, A A Hoffmann, R Hallas, C Sinclair, L Partridge"

We have isolated a homologue of dsx in the silkworm, Bombyx mori, which has an epistatic feminizing gene located on the W chromosome. RT-PCR analysis indicated that B. mori dsx (Bmdsx) was transcribed in all the examined tissues, and the size of the amplified products was different between males and females. In Northern blot hybridization of poly(A)(+) RNA, the Bmdsx probe also detected a band with a sex-specific size difference. The male-specific cDNA lacked the sequence between 713 and 961nt of the female-specific cDNA. An RNase protection assay indicated that this sequence was male-specifically removed from the Bmdsx pre-mRNA. Southern blot analysis showed that Bmdsx is present at a single copy in the genome. These results suggested that the primary Bmdsx transcript is alternatively spliced to yield male- and female-specific mRNA isoforms. These sex-specific isoforms encode polypeptides with a common amino-terminal sequence but sex-specific carboxyl termini.

Transcription through intergenic chromosomal memory elements of the Drosophila bithorax complex correlates with an epigenetic switch,12391168,10.1128/mcb.22.22.8026-8034.2002,"The proteins of the trithorax and Polycomb groups maintain the differential expression pattern of homeotic genes established by the early embryonic patterning system during development. These proteins generate stable and heritable chromatin structures by acting via particular chromosomal memory elements. We established a transgenic assay system showing that the Polycomb group response elements bxd and Mcp confer epigenetic inheritance throughout development. With previously published data for the Fab7 cellular memory module, we confirmed the cellular memory function of Polycomb group response elements. In Drosophila melanogaster, several of these memory elements are located in the large intergenic regulatory regions of the homeotic bithorax complex. Using a transgene assay, we showed that transcription through a memory element correlated with the relief of silencing imposed by the Polycomb group proteins and established an epigenetically heritable active chromatin mode. A memory element remodeled by the process of transcription was able to maintain active expression of a reporter gene throughout development. Thus, transcription appears to reset and change epigenetic marks at chromosomal memory elements regulated by the Polycomb and trithorax proteins. Interestingly, in the bithorax complex of D. melanogaster, the segment-specific expression of noncoding intergenic transcripts during embryogenesis seems to fulfill this switching role for memory elements regulating the homeotic genes.",2002,"Gerhard Rank, Matthias Prestel, Renato Paro, Gerhard Rank, Matthias Prestel, Renato Paro"
The X chromosome is a hot spot for sexually antagonistic fitness variation,11886642,10.1098/rspb.2001.1863,"Sexually antagonistic alleles are selected discordantly between the sexes. Experimental evidence indicates that sexually antagonistic fitness variation is abundant in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Theory predicts that the X chromosome will be enriched with this type of variation. To test this prediction in D. melanogaster, we sampled, and cytogenetically cloned, 20 X chromosomes and compared their fitness variation to genome-wide levels. At the juvenile stage, in which gender roles are most similar, the X chromosome made no detectable contribution to genome-wide fitness variation. At the adult stage, in which gender roles diverge, the X chromosome was estimated to harbour 45% of the genome-wide fitness variation and 97% of the genome-wide sexually antagonistic variation. This genomic structure has important implications for the process of sexual selection because X-linked sexually antagonistic variation contributes to negative intersexual heritability for fitness, i.e. high-fitness males (females) produce, on average, low-fitness daughters (sons).",2002,"Jonathan R Gibson, Adam K Chippindale, William R Rice, Jonathan R Gibson, Adam K Chippindale, William R Rice"
Lack of hypergravity-associated longevity extension in Drosophila melanogaster flies overexpressing hsp70,12510174,10.1023/a:1021367800170,"Previous studies have shown that Drosophila melanogaster males live longer if exposed to hypergravity at young age. Similarly, thermotolerance and climbing activity in old age are enhanced and it has been hypothesized that the 70 kDa inducible heat-shock protein (hsp70) may play a role in some of these effects. In this article, longevity, thermotolerance and climbing activity were studied in transgenic flies (OE+ strain) overexpressing hsp70 and in control flies harboring the transfection vector at the same chromosomal location but no extra-copies of the hsp70 gene (OE- strain). No positive effect from exposure to hypergravity at a young age was observed for longevity and climbing activity. Thermotolerance was increased by hypergravity but to the same extent in OE+ and OE- strains. Since no positive effect from hypergravity exposure or similar effects were observed in the two strains, it may be concluded that overexpression of hsp70 does not provide an advantage to flies subjected to a mild stress and that it may not be of any help during aging.",2002,"Eric Le Bourg, Philippe Valenti, FranÃ§ois Payre, Eric Le Bourg, Philippe Valenti, FranÃ§ois Payre"
Ecdysone triggers the expression of Golgi genes in Drosophila imaginal discs via broad-complex,11969264,10.1006/dbio.2002.0632,"One of the most significant morphogenic events in the development of Drosophila melanogaster is the elongation of imaginal discs during puparium formation. We have shown that this macroscopic event is accompanied by the formation of Golgi stacks from small Golgi larval clusters of vesicles and tubules that are present prior to the onset of disc elongation. We have shown that the fly steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone triggers both the elongation itself and the formation of Golgi stacks (V. Kondylis, S. E. Goulding, J. C. Dunne, and C. Rabouille, 2001, Mol. Biol. Cell, 12, 2308). Using mRNA in situ hybridisation, we show here that ecdysone triggers the upregulation of a subset of genes encoding Golgi-related proteins (such as dnsf1, dsec23, dsed5, and drab1) and downregulates the expression of others (such as dergic53, dbeta'COP, and drab6). We show that the transcription factor Broad-complex, itself an ""early"" ecdysone target, mediates this regulation. And we show that the ecdysone-independent upregulation of dnsf1 and dsnap prior to the ecdysone peak leads to a precocious formation of large Golgi stacks. The ecdysone-triggered biogenesis of Golgi stacks at the onset of imaginal disc elongation offers the exciting possibility of advancing our understanding of the relationship between gene expression and organelle biogenesis.",2002,"Jonathan C Dunne, Vangelis Kondylis, Catherine Rabouille, Jonathan C Dunne, Vangelis Kondylis, Catherine Rabouille"

Regulation of larval hematopoiesis in Drosophila melanogaster: a role for the multi sex combs gene,12454071,,"Drosophila larval hematopoietic organs produce circulating hemocytes that ensure the cellular host defense by recognizing and neutralizing non-self or noxious objects through phagocytosis or encapsulation and melanization. Hematopoietic lineage specification as well as blood cell proliferation and differentiation are tightly controlled. Mutations in genes that regulate lymph gland cell proliferation and hemocyte numbers in the body cavity cause hematopoietic organ overgrowth and hemocyte overproliferation. Occasionally, mutant hemocytes invade self-tissues, behaving like neoplastic malignant cells. Two alleles of the Polycomb group (PcG) gene multi sex combs (mxc) were previously isolated as such lethal malignant blood neoplasm mutations. PcG genes regulate Hox gene expression in vertebrates and invertebrates and participate in mammalian hematopoiesis control. Hence we investigated the need for mxc in Drosophila hematopoietic organs and circulating hemocytes. We show that mxc-induced hematopoietic hyperplasia is cell autonomous and that mxc mainly controls plasmatocyte lineage proliferation and differentiation in lymph glands and circulating hemocytes. Loss of the Toll pathway, which plays a similar role in hematopoiesis, counteracted mxc hemocyte proliferation but not mxc hemocyte differentiation. Several PcG genes tested in trans had no effects on mxc hematopoietic phenotypes, whereas the trithorax group gene brahma is important for normal and mutant hematopoiesis control. We propose that mxc provides one of the regulatory inputs in larval hematopoiesis that control normal rates of plasmatocyte and crystal lineage proliferation as well as normal rates and timing of hemocyte differentiation.",2002,"Nathalie Remillieux-Leschelle, Pedro Santamaria, Neel B Randsholt, Nathalie Remillieux-Leschelle, Pedro Santamaria, Neel B Randsholt"

An elaborate code in their DNA sequence translates both maternal and early embryonic regulatory signals into spatial distribution of transcription factors. One of the most striking features of this code is the redundancy of binding sites for these transcription factors (BSTF). Using this redundancy, we explored the possibility of predicting functional binding sites in a single enhancer region without any prior consensus/matrix description or evolutionary sequence comparisons. We developed a conceptually simple algorithm, Scanseq, that employs an original statistical evaluation for identifying the most redundant motifs and locates the position of potential BSTF in a given regulatory region. To estimate the biological relevance of our predictions, we built thorough literature-based annotations for the best-known Drosophila developmental enhancers and we generated detailed distribution maps for the most robust binding sites. The high statistical correlation between the location of BSTF in these experiment-based maps and the location predicted in silico by Scanseq confirmed the relevance of our approach.

Either mutation changed both the expressiveness of vestigial and the degree of chromsome polyteny. A negative association between the vg expressiveness and the degree of chromosome polyteny was revealed and proved to be stronger in females than in males. The parameters under study were shown to differ between females and males.,2002,"T V Kirpichenko, V Iu Strashniuk, L I Vorob'eva, V G Shakhbazov, T V Kirpichenko, V Iu Strashniuk, L I Vorob'eva, V G Shakhbazov"
The evolution of sex determination systems in dipteran insects other than Drosophila,12484524,10.1023/a:1020955507978,"The multitude of sex determination mechanisms displayed in dipteran insects has usually been described in terms of variations on a single principle in which the primary signal of the primitive pathway consists of a single allelic difference at one locus. Evolution of sex determination mechanisms is thought to have occurred by the addition of genes below the top gene of the pathway. The elucidation of the complex sex determination pathway of Drosophila melanogaster, as well as recent evidence that the basal genes of the pathway seem to be conserved across metazoan genera both in structure and, to a lesser degree, in function, points towards the possibility that sex determination pathways may have evolved from the bottom-up. Further to this is the question of whether the dominant male-determining factor, M, which is found in a number of insect species, represents part of the ancient sex determination pathway or is a later addition to the pathway. This, together with the possibility that the M factors found in numerous dipteran insect species may have a common origin, is discussed. The similarities of the sex determination pathways under the control of M and the implications in relation to the construction of genetic sexing strains for biological control are also discussed.",2002,"D C A Shearman, D C A Shearman"
Functional reconstitution of purified metabotropic glutamate receptor expressed in the fly eye,11964379,10.1093/embo-reports/kvf088,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) form one of the largest superfamilies of membrane proteins. Obtaining high yields of GPCRs remains one of the major factors limiting a detailed understanding of their structure and function. Photoreceptor cells (PRCs) contain extensive stacks of specialized membranes where high levels of rhodopsins are naturally present, which makes them ideal for the overexpression of GPCRs. We have generated transgenic flies expressing a number of GPCRs in the PRCs. Drosophila melanogaster metabotropic glutamate receptor (DmGluRA) expressed by this novel strategy was purified to homogeneity, giving at least 3-fold higher yields than conventional baculovirus expression systems due to the higher membrane content of the PRCs. Pure DmGluRA was then reconstituted into liposomes of varying composition. Interestingly, glutamate binding was strictly dependent on the presence of ergosterol.",2002,"Cagla Eroglu, Philippe Cronet, ValÃ©rie Panneels, Philippe Beaufils, Irmgard Sinning, Cagla Eroglu, Philippe Cronet, ValÃ©rie Panneels, Philippe Beaufils, Irmgard Sinning"

Accumulation of deleterious mutations: additional Drosophila melanogaster estimates and a simulation of the effects of selection,12144016,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb01428.x,"We report an assay of egg-to-adult viability in full-sibling mutation accumulation (MA) lines derived from a completely homozygous population of Drosophila melanogaster and maintained for 210 generations. A simultaneous evaluation was also made of a large population derived from the same origin and maintained as a control for the same period. We also present computer simulations to explore the possible decline in viability of the control population due to mutation accumulation and the possible effect of selection within and between MA lines. For this purpose, we used two mutational models independent from the data analyzed and based on radically different assumptions. The first model implies a large number of mutations of small effect, whereas the second implies a much smaller number of mutations with much larger effects. The observed rate of decline in mean viability was very small but significant (0.077%). The rate of increase in among line variance (0.189 x 10(-3)) was similar to those obtained previously in the same lines. The simulation results indicated that a model of many mutations of small effect is incompatible with the evolution of the mean viability of the control and MA lines over generations, the distribution of line means after 210 generations of mutation accumulation, and the pattern of line extinction over generations. Basically, this model predicted a large drop in viability, both in the control and particularly the MA lines, that is not observed empirically. It also predicted a rate of line extinction too low in the early generations and too high in the later ones.

Centromere targeting element within the histone fold domain of Cid,12370302,10.1128/mcb.22.21.7553-7561.2002,"Centromeres require specialized nucleosomes; however, the mechanism of localization is unknown. Drosophila sp. centromeric nucleosomes contain the Cid H3-like protein. We have devised a strategy for identifying elements within Cid responsible for its localization to centromeres. By expressing Cid from divergent Drosophila species fused to green fluorescent protein in Drosophila melanogaster cells, we found that D. bipectinata Cid fails to localize to centromeres. Cid chimeras consisting of the D. bipectinata histone fold domain (HFD) replaced with segments from D. melanogaster identified loop I of the HFD as being critical for targeting to centromeres. Conversely, substitution of D. bipectinata loop I into D. melanogaster abolished centromeric targeting. In either case, loop I was the only segment capable of conferring targeting. Within loop I, we identified residues that are critical for targeting. Most mutations of conserved residues abolished targeting, and length reductions were deleterious. Taken together with the fact that H3 loop I makes numerous contacts with DNA and with the adaptive evolution of Cid, our results point to the importance of DNA specificity for targeting. We suggest that the process of deposition of (Cid.H4)2 tetramers allows for discriminating contacts to be made between loop I and DNA, providing the specificity needed for targeting.",2002,"Danielle Vermaak, Hillary S Hayden, Steven Henikoff, Danielle Vermaak, Hillary S Hayden, Steven Henikoff"

X-linked small GTPase and OXPHOS genes are candidates for the genetic basis of hybrid inviability in Drosophila,12424521,10.1007/s00427-002-0271-y,"Genetic studies on postmating reproductive isolation in Drosophila have suggested that the genetic basis of hybrid inviability is much less complex than the basis of hybrid sterility, and may be associated with defects affecting the cell cycle. Here I report the identification of a cluster of genes in the middle of the X chromosome of D. melanogaster, which may be responsible for the inviability of hybrids between Drosophila species. Genes from this cluster code for small Ras GTPases proteins, which are hypothesized here to interact with proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), encoded by genes present within the same cluster. At least six genes influencing small Ras GTPases/OXPHOS activity are transcribed from the same strand across 35 kb genomic DNA. This interval is predicted to harbor genes which, when mutated, rescue otherwise inviable hybrids between D. melanogaster and its three most closely related species. Moreover, a total of 16 small GTPase/OXPHOS genes are found within 530 kb genomic DNA encompassing the above cluster. In D. melanogaster mutants which fully rescue lethal hybrids, major lesions have now been identified very near or within untranslated regions of two OXPHOS genes from the above cluster. These observations led to a hypothesis focusing on antagonistic co-evolution between biparentally inherited genes influencing putative GTPase/OXPHOS activity and mitochondrial genes encoding OXPHOS proteins. Alterations in some of these genes are postulated to override hybrid inviability, thus revealing a pathway which implicates mitotic genes as critical players in this barrier to reproduction.",2002,"Pierre Hutter, Pierre Hutter"

Cloning and functional analysis of pyruvate kinase promoter region from Drosophila melanogaster,11879575,10.1089/10445490252810267,"Pyruvate kinase (PK; EC 2.7.1.40) is a key glycolytic enzyme of Drosophila melanogaster. It catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate into pyruvate with the transfer of a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP. The ATP provides energy for cell growth and metabolism, and pyruvate participates in many metabolic reactions. Therefore, PK plays an important role in cell metabolism. Southern blot analysis, PCR, and sequencing were used to determine the content of a Drosophila pyruvate kinase (Pyk) genomic clone, lambdaPK61. The results indicated that the insert of lambdaPK61 comprised 8330 bp upstream of and 7186 bp downstream of the transcription start point of the Pyk gene. The size of the insert was 15,516 bp in total, which contained six genes including Pyk. Deletion mapping was applied to identify the promoter region and cis-acting elements 5' of PyK. Ten serial deletions produced by PCR were inserted upstream of the reporter gene (LacZ) to form recombinant plasmids, which were then transfected into Drosophila S2 cells. The results revealed that the regions -1475 approximately -1033 and -1033 approximately -534 of the 5' end of PyK possessed positive regulatory function for Pyk expression; i.e., increased gene expression. There were redundant putative cis-acting elements, including ecdysone response element (EcRE), E74A, and broad complex zinc finger (BRCZ) binding sites. Both E74A and BRCZ belong to the early genes regulated by ecdysone. This result suggested that Pyk might be regulated by ecdysone, directly or indirectly. However, the results of the developmental profile of Pyk expression by Northern blot analysis suggested that the effects of ecdysone on Pyk were repressive, not inductive. In addition, it was found that in these regions, there were many cis-acting elements related to egg and embryo development. Both -258 approximately -254 and -167 approximately -163 contained a CAAT box, and deletion of these regions decreased reporter gene expression. Therefore, it is suggested that both CAAT boxes are functional and that the promoter of Pyk might be located in the region of -258 approximately +109. No TATA box or downstream promoter element were identified around the transcription start site of Pyk. Additionally, PyK might share a regulatory region with an unknown neighboring gene. It was concluded that Pyk has the characteristics of a housekeeping gene.",2002,"Pi Feng Hsiao, Yu-Jing Zhu, Yi-Chih Chien, Pi Feng Hsiao, Yu-Jing Zhu, Yi-Chih Chien"

The RECQ5/QE protein hydrolyzed ATP and even more actively GTP in the presence of single-stranded DNA. ATP drove the DNA helicase activity of RECQ5/QE, whereas GTP had little effect. GTP exhibited a stimulatory effect on DNA unwinding when it was used together with ATP. This effect was more apparent with non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs, such as GTPgammaS and GMPPNP. These results indicate that GTP binding to RECQ5/QE triggers its DNA helicase activity. GTP binding increased the rate of strand separation without affecting the S(0.5) (K(m)) values for the substrates during the DNA helicase reaction. The data collectively suggest that the RECQ5/QE protein is activated upon GTP binding through the ATP-binding site.",2002,"Katsumi Kawasaki, Sayako Maruyama, Minoru Nakayama, Kohji Matsumoto, Takehiko Shibata, Katsumi Kawasaki, Sayako Maruyama, Minoru Nakayama, Kohji Matsumoto, Takehiko Shibata"
Developmental regulation of alternative exon usage in the house fly Vssc1 sodium channel gene,12488972,10.1007/s10158-001-0014-1,"Sequence analysis of cDNA clones amplified by PCR from house fly ( Musca domestica L.)

Nine of these corresponded to the 7 optional exons (designated a, b, e, f, h, i, and j) and 2 mutually exclusive exons (designated c/d) identified previously in the orthologous para sodium channel alpha subunit genes of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis, whereas two segments represented new mutually exclusive exons in Vssc1 (designated k/l) located in a region not previously identified as a site of alternative splicing in para. Diagnostic PCR assays on individual Vssc1 cDNA templates detected the presence or absence of each putative alternative exon in multiple partial cDNAs (42-96 individual clones per cDNA pool) from newly emerged first instar larvae, pupae, day 1 adult heads, and day 1 adult bodies. Exons h and i were present in all cDNA clones from all developmental stages. Exon d was also present in all clones from all developmental stages that encoded full-length amino acid sequences; however, 1 of 42 clones from adult head contained an exon c-like segment in which the coding sequence was terminated by a premature stop codon. In contrast, the frequencies of exons a, b, e, f, j, k, and l differed between developmental stages and adult anatomical regions. Analysis of the Vssc1 region containing alternative exons a, b, c/d, e, f, h, and i as a single amplified cDNA segment identified nine Vssc1 splice variants involving these exons. The splice variant containing exons a, d, h, and i was the most abundant form in all cDNA pools examined, but the observed patterns of splice variant expression were specific to each developmental stage and adult anatomical region.

mei-P22 encodes a chromosome-associated protein required for the initiation of meiotic recombination in Drosophila melanogaster,12242237,,"Double-strand breaks (DSB) initiate meiotic recombination in a variety of organisms. Here we present genetic evidence that the mei-P22 gene is required for the induction of DSBs during meiotic prophase in Drosophila females. Strong mei-P22 mutations eliminate meiotic crossing over and suppress the sterility of DSB repair-defective mutants. Interestingly, crossing over in mei-P22 mutants can be restored to almost 50% of wild-type by X irradiation. In addition, an antibody-based assay was used to demonstrate that DSBs are not formed in mei-P22 mutants. This array of phenotypes is identical to that of mei-W68 mutants; mei-W68 encodes the Drosophila Spo11 homolog that is proposed to be an enzyme required for DSB formation. Consistent with a direct role in DSB formation, mei-P22 encodes a basic 35.7-kD protein, which, when examined by immunofluorescence, localizes to foci on meiotic chromosomes. MEI-P22 foci appear transiently in early meiotic prophase, which is when meiotic recombination is believed to initiate. By using an antibody to C(3)G as a marker for synaptonemal complex (SC) formation, we observed that SC is present before MEI-P22 associates with the chromosomes, thus providing direct evidence that the development of SC precedes the initiation of meiotic recombination. Similarly, we found that MEI-P22 foci did not appear in a c(3)G mutant in which SC does not form, suggesting that DSB formation is dependent on SC formation in Drosophila. We propose that MEI-P22 interacts with meiosis-specific chromosome proteins to facilitate DSB creation by MEI-W68.",2002,"Hao Liu, Janet K Jang, Naohiro Kato, Kim S McKim, Hao Liu, Janet K Jang, Naohiro Kato, Kim S McKim"
Heterochromatin protein 1 is involved in control of telomere elongation in Drosophila melanogaster,11940677,10.1128/mcb.22.9.3204-3218.2002,"Telomeres of Drosophila melanogaster contain arrays of the retrotransposon-like elements HeT-A and TART. Their transposition to broken chromosome ends has been implicated in chromosome healing and telomere elongation. We have developed a genetic system which enables the determination of the frequency of telomere elongation events and their mechanism. The frequency differs among lines with different genotypes, suggesting that several genes are in control. Here we show that the Su(var)2-5 gene encoding heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is involved in regulation of telomere length. Different Su(var)2-5 mutations in the heterozygous state increase the frequency of HeT-A and TART attachment to the broken chromosome end by more than a hundred times. The attachment occurs through either HeT-A/TART transposition or recombination with other telomeres. Terminal DNA elongation by gene conversion is greatly enhanced by Su(var)2-5 mutations only if the template for DNA synthesis is on the same chromosome but not on the homologous chromosome. The Drosophila lines bearing the Su(var)2-5 mutations maintain extremely long telomeres consisting of HeT-A and TART for many generations.

Hill-Robertson interference is a minor determinant of variations in codon bias across Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes,12200468,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004203,"According to population genetics models, genomic regions with lower crossing-over rates are expected to experience less effective selection because of Hill-Robertson interference (HRi). The effect of genetic linkage is thought to be particularly important for a selection of weak intensity such as selection affecting codon usage. Consistent with this model, codon bias correlates positively with recombination rate in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. However, in these species, the G+C content of both noncoding DNA and synonymous sites correlates positively with recombination, which suggests that mutation patterns and recombination are associated. To remove this effect of mutation patterns on codon bias, we used the synonymous sites of lowly expressed genes that are expected to be effectively neutral sites. We measured the differences between codon biases of highly expressed genes and their lowly expressed neighbors. In D. melanogaster we find that HRi weakly reduces selection on codon usage of genes located in regions of very low recombination; but these genes only comprise 4% of the total. In C. elegans we do not find any evidence for the effect of recombination on selection for codon bias. Computer simulations indicate that HRi poorly enhances codon bias if the local recombination rate is greater than the mutation rate. This prediction of the model is consistent with our data and with the current estimate of the mutation rate in D. melanogaster. The case of C. elegans, which is highly self-fertilizing, is discussed. Our results suggest that HRi is a minor determinant of variations in codon bias across the genome.",2002,"Gabriel Marais, GwenaÃ«l Piganeau, Gabriel Marais, GwenaÃ«l Piganeau"

Homologous factors regulate differentiation of some ectodermic tissues in invertebrates. To explore the molecular basis of these different physiological functions, the functionality of human, Drosophila melanogaster and Artemia franciscana SRFs in mammalian cells has been compared in this article. D. melanogaster and, to a lesser extend, A. franciscana SRF co-expression represses the activity of strong SRF-dependent promoters, such as those of the mouse c-fos and A. franciscana actin 403 genes. Domain-exchange experiments showed that these results can be explained by the absence of a transactivation domain, functional in mammalian cells, in D. melanogaster and A. franciscana SRFs. Both invertebrate SRFs can dimerize with endogenous mouse SRF through the conserved DNA-binding and dimerization domain. Co-expression of human and A. franciscana SRFs activate expression of weaker SRF-dependent promoters, such as those of the human cardiac alpha-actin gene or an A. franciscana actin 403 promoter where the SRF-binding site has been mutated.

The ear gene product is present in all early embryonic cells, but becomes restricted to specific tissues in late embryogenesis. We mapped the ear gene to cytological region 88E11-13, near easter, and showed that it is deleted by Df(3R)ea(5022rx1), a small, cytologically invisible deletion. Annotation of the completed Drosophila genome sequence suggests that this region might contain as many as 26 genes, most of which, including ear, are not represented by mutant alleles. We carried out a large-scale noncomplementation screen using Df(3R)ea(5022rx1) and chemical (EMS) mutagenesis from which we identified seven novel multi-allele recessive lethal complementation groups in this region. An overlapping deficiency, Df(3R)Po(4), allowed us to map several of these groups to either the proximal or the distal regions of Df(3R)ea(5022rx1).

However, insect protein glycosylation pathways are not well understood and appear to differ from those of mammalian cells. One way to more clearly evaluate the protein glycosylation potential of insect cells is to use the Drosophila melanogaster genome to identify genes that might encode relevant functions. These genes can then be expressed and the functions of the gene products directly evaluated by biochemical assays. In this study, we used this approach to determine the function of a putative Drosophila nucleotide sugar transporter gene. The results showed that this gene encodes a protein that can transport UDP-galactose, but not CMP-sialic acid. Thus, Drosophila encodes at least some of the infrastructure needed to produce glycoproteins with complex glycans, but this particular gene product does not directly support glycoprotein sialylation.

Variation of the genome size estimate with environmental conditions in Drosophila melanogaster,12938187,10.1002/cyto.a.10061,"Background:
      
    

    
      Genome size is known to exhibit interspecies differences, but also to vary between populations within a given species and even between individual cells within an organism. Major differences have often been reported and attributed to differences in measurement conditions, in internal controls of genome size, and in the stains used. Flow cytometry using intercalating dyes is the most attractive method for measuring genome size.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      We estimated relative genome size of nuclei from heads of Drosophila melanogaster adult males using a FACScalibur flow cytometer and propidium iodide.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We have shown that the genome size estimates depended on the temperature and humidity of the rearing medium and decreased with age in adult flies. There were large differences in genome size estimates between the vials in which the flies were maintained, but only slight variations within the vials, supporting the idea that the size estimate depends on the fly rearing conditions. Changes in the temperature of the solution of head nuclei analyzed by the cytometer also influenced the genome size estimate.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      These findings clearly show that the environmental conditions under which the flies were reared influence the genome size estimate, perhaps as a result of a change in the accessibility of the DNA to the fluorochrome.

[Comparative analysis of MGE 412 patterns in 18 isogenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster],12722634,,"Comparative analysis of patterns of mobile genetic element 412 was conducted in 18 isogenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster isolated in three isogenic experiments in 1987 through 1999. Twelve ""extra-hot"" isogenization sites (in 15-18 lines) and 23 ""hot"" isogenization sites (> or = 10 lines) were found; of these, 19 occurred in the original heterogeneous line. These sites virtually do not overlap with hot induction sites of transposition. Sites of the latter group generally retain their positions during isogenization. It was shown that no more than 20% of the new sites were brought from the balancer by double recombination, while inbreeding and outbreeding caused 80% of them. Different factors were shown to have different hot isogenization sites. A similarity tree was constructed for the patterns of 18 isogenic lines. The maximum peak of the tree was very low (< 0.25), i.e., the isogenic lines are more similar to than different from one another. The tree was subdivided into subtrees. The division was in good agreement with the isogenization groups corresponding to individual isogenization experiments. Significant correlation was found between the total fragment length and the number of new sites per lines.",2003,"L A Vasil'eva, V A Ratner, L A Vasil'eva, V A Ratner"
T-box genes and cardiac development,12768655,10.1002/bdrc.10001,"Background:
      
    

    
      T-box genes play roles in vertebrate gastrulation and in later organogenesis. Their existence in all metazoans examined so far indicates that this is an evolutionarily ancient gene family. Drosophila melanogaster has eight T-box genes, whereas Caenorhabditis elegans has 22. Mammals appear to have at least 18 T-box genes, comprising five subfamilies.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      A full range of cytological, developmental, molecular and genetic methodologies have recently been applied to the study of T-box genes.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Over the last 5 years, mutations in TBX1 and TBX5 have been implicated in two human disorders with haplo-insufficient cardiovascular phenotypes, DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome and Holt-Oram (""heart-hand"") syndrome. Interestingly, the number of T-box gene family members discovered to have cardiac or pharyngeal arch expression domains during vertebrate embryonic development has steadily grown. In addition, various Tbx5 loss-of-function models in organisms as distant as the mouse and zebrafish do indeed phenocopy Holt-Oram syndrome. Finally, the intriguing discovery earlier this year that a T-box gene is expressed in a subset of cardioblasts in D. melanogaster suggests that members of this gene family may have fundamental, conserved roles in cardiovascular pattern formation.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      These developments prompted us to review the current understanding of the contribution of T-box genes to cardiovascular morphogenesis.",2003,"Kenneth Ryan, Alvin J Chin, Kenneth Ryan, Alvin J Chin"
SU(VAR)3-9 is a conserved key function in heterochromatic gene silencing,12723694,10.1023/a:1022923508198,"This review summarizes genetic, molecular and biochemical studies of the SU(VAR)3-9 protein and the evidence for its key role in heterochromatin formation and heterochromatic gene silencing. The Su(var)3-9 locus was first identified as a dominant modifier of position-effect variegation (PEV) in Drosophila melanogaster. Together with Su(var)2-5 and Su(var)3-7, Su(var)3-9 belongs to the group of haplo-suppressor loci which show a triplo-dependent enhancer effect. All three genes encode heterochromatin-associated proteins. Su(var)3-9 is epistatic to the PEV modifier effects of Su(var)2-5 and Su(var)3-7, and it also dominates the effect of the Y chromosome on PEV. These genetic data support a central role of the SU(VAR)3-9 protein in heterochromatic gene silencing, one that is correlated with its activity as a histone H3-K9 methyltransferase (HMTase). In fact, SU(VAR)3-9 is the main chromocenter-specific HMTase of Drosophila. SU(VAR)3-9 and HP1, the product of Su(var)2-5, are main constituents of heterochromatin protein complexes and the interaction between these two proteins is interdependent. Functional analysis in fission yeast, Drosophila and mammals demonstrate that SU(VAR)3-9-dependent gene silencing processes are conserved in these organisms. This is also demonstrated by the rescue of Drosophila Su(var)3-9 mutant phenotypes with human SUV39H1 transgenes.",2003,"Gunnar Schotta, Anja Ebert, Gunter Reuter, Gunnar Schotta, Anja Ebert, Gunter Reuter"
A strategy for mapping the heterochromatin of chromosome 2 of Drosophila melanogaster,12723701,10.1023/a:1022948229580,"The heterochromatin of chromosome 2 of Drosophila melanogaster has been among the best characterized models for functional studies of heterochromatin owing to its abundance of genetic markers. To determine whether it might also provide a favorable system for mapping extended regions of heterochromatin, we undertook a project to molecularly map the heterochromatin of the left arm of chromosome 2 (2Lh). In this paper, we describe a strategy that used clones and sequence information available from the Drosophila Genome Project and chromosome rearrangements to construct a map of the distal most portion of 2Lh. We also describe studies that used fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to examine the resolution of this technique for cytologically resolving heterochromatic sequences on mitotic chromosomes. We discuss how these mapping studies can be extended to more proximal regions of the heterochromatin to determine the structural patterns and physical dimensions of 2Lh and the relationship of structure to function.",2003,"Jiro C Yasuhara, Marcella Marchetti, Laura Fanti, Sergio Pimpinelli, Barbara T Wakimoto, Jiro C Yasuhara, Marcella Marchetti, Laura Fanti, Sergio Pimpinelli, Barbara T Wakimoto"
Characterization of three Toll-like genes from mosquito Aedes aegypti,12542637,10.1046/j.1365-2583.2003.00388.x,"Three Toll-related genes (AeToll1A, AeToll1B and AeToll5) were cloned and characterized from the yellow fever vector mosquito, Aedes aegypti. All three genes exhibited high levels of amino acid sequence similarity with Drosophila melanogaster (Dm)Toll1 and DmTehao (Toll5). AeToll1A and AeToll1B are 1124 and 1076 amino acid residues long, respectively. Both contain a carboxyl extension downstream of the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. AeToll5 is 1007 residues long and, like DmTehao, lacks the carboxyl terminal extension. Expression of these three genes was examined throughout development and after immune challenge. Both AeToll1A and AeToll5, like their Drosophila counterparts, activate transcription of drosomycin promoter in both Aedes and Drosophila cell lines. Deletion of the carboxyl extension of AeToll1A did not result in a further elevated level of the antifungal response. The intracellular signalling process appears to be species specific based on two observations. (1) DmToll is completely inactive in an Aedes cell line, suggesting a higher specificity requirement for DmToll in the intracellular signalling process. (2) Only one of three amino acid residues essential for DmToll function is required for AeToll1A function.",2003,"C Luna, N T Hoa, J Zhang, S M Kanzok, S E Brown, J-L Imler, D L Knudson, L Zheng, C Luna, N T Hoa, J Zhang, S M Kanzok, S E Brown, J-L Imler, D L Knudson, L Zheng"
[The distribution and origin of P elements in Drosophila melanogaster strains from northeast China],14574994,,"Eukaryotic transposable elements, especially P transposable elements of Drosophla, are very important to study the evolution of biology. We collected 130 single--female lines of D. melanogaster from 13 places in Northeast China and 3 places nearby which are Beijing(BC), Yantai (YT), Huhehaote(HHT) in 1999 and 2000. We amplified the fragments from ORF2 to ORF3 of P elements using PCR and calculated the defective frequencies and defective parameters of P elements from different places. Basing on the distribution of defective P elements, we suggested the invasion route of P elements of D. melanogaster in Northeast China. The results indicate that the defective frequencies decrease from the frontier to the inland, and in the isolated places the frequencies are lower. It is proposed that P elements of D. melanogaster in Northeast China originate from Korea and Russia to the frontiers of P.R.

Insulin stimulates glucose metabolism via the pentose phosphate pathway in Drosophila Kc cells,14644433,10.1016/s0014-5793(03)01261-4,"Drosophila melanogaster has become a prominent and convenient model for analysis of insulin action. However, to date very little is known regarding the effect of insulin on glucose uptake and metabolism in Drosophila. Here we show that, in contrast to effects seen in mammals, insulin did not alter [(3)H]2-deoxyglucose uptake and in fact decreased glycogen synthesis ( approximately 30%) in embryonic Drosophila Kc cells. Insulin significantly increased ( approximately 1.5-fold) the production of (14)CO(2) from D-[1-(14)C]glucose while the production of (14)CO(2) from D-[6-(14)C]glucose was not altered. Thus, insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation did not occur via increasing Krebs cycle activity but rather by stimulating the pentose phosphate pathway. Indeed, inhibition of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway by 6-aminonicotinamide abolished the effect of insulin on (14)CO(2) from D-[U-(14)C]glucose. A corresponding increase in lactate production but no change in incorporation of D-[U-(14)C]glucose into total lipids was observed in response to insulin. Glucose metabolism via the pentose phosphate pathway may provide an important source of 5'-phosphate for DNA synthesis and cell replication. This novel observation correlates well with the fact that control of growth and development is the major role of insulin-like peptides in Drosophila. Thus, although intracellular signaling is well conserved, the metabolic effects of insulin are dramatically different between Drosophila and mammals.",2003,"Rolando B Ceddia, George J Bikopoulos, Arthur J Hilliker, Gary Sweeney, Rolando B Ceddia, George J Bikopoulos, Arthur J Hilliker, Gary Sweeney"
Evolution of the olfactory code in the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup,14667348,10.1098/rspb.2003.2512,"The Drosophila melanogaster subgroup has been the focus of numerous studies about evolution. We address the question of how the olfactory code has evolved among the nine sister species. By using in vivo electrophysiological measurements, so called single-cell recordings, we have established the ligand affinity of a defined subset of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) across all nine species. We show that the olfactory code as relayed by the investigated subset of ORNs is conserved to a striking degree. Distinct shifts in the code have occurred only within the simulans clade. However, these shifts are restricted to an altered tuning profile of the same single ORN type in all three of the simulans siblings and a more drastic change unique to D. sechellia, involving a complete loss of one sensillum type in favour of another. The alterations observed in D. sechellia may represent a novel host-specific adaptation to its sole host, morinda fruit (Morinda citrifolia). The overall high degree of similarity of the code within the subgroup is intriguing when considering the great variety in distributions as well as in habitat and host choice of the siblings, factors that could greatly affect the olfactory system.",2003,"Marcus C Stensmyr, Teun Dekker, Bill S Hansson, Marcus C Stensmyr, Teun Dekker, Bill S Hansson"
Cystocyte and lymphocyte derived fusomes/spectrosomes: analogies and differences: a mini-review,12655376,,"Structures analogous to Drosophila spectrosomes were found in mammalian lymphocytes. Repasky and colleagues discovered an intracellular spectrin-rich structure in lymphoid cells, which had far-reaching parallels with the fusome/spectrosome of D. melanogaster germ cells. This fact implies that spectrosomes may be characteristic not only of insect germ cells, but also that an analogous structure may play an important role in other cell types. The term ""spectrosome"" was first used by Lin and Spradling in 1995 to describe a large sphere of fusomal material in D. melanogaster germline stem cells and their differentiated daughter cells - cytoblasts. In the D. melanogaster ovary, membrane skeletal proteins such as ankyrin, alpha/beta spectrin as well as adducin-like Hts protein(s) were found in this specific organelle - spectrosome/fusome.

Appendage patterning in Drosophila melanogaster is well characterized, inviting candidate-gene-based approaches that identify the developmental mechanisms underlying Drosophilid eggshell diversity. Previous studies show that a combination of Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and TGFbeta/BMP2,4 Decapentaplegic (DPP) signaling determines appendage fate in D. melanogaster. Broad-Complex expression integrates EGFR and DPP signaling and predicts future appendage position.

Gamma-aminobutyric acid B receptor 1 mediates behavior-impairing actions of alcohol in Drosophila: adult RNA interference and pharmacological evidence,12692303,10.1073/pnas.0830111100,"In addition to their physiological function, metabotropic receptors for neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the GABA(B) receptors, may play a role in the behavioral actions of addictive compounds. Recently, GABA(B) receptors were cloned in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), indicating that the advantages of this experimental model could be applied to GABA(B) receptor research. RNA interference (RNAi) is an endogenous process triggered by double-stranded RNA and is being used as a tool for functional gene silencing and functional genomics. Here we show how cell-nonautonomous RNAi can be induced in adult fruit flies to silence a subtype of GABA(B) receptors, GABA(B)R1, and how RNAi combined with pharmacobehavioral techniques (including intraabdominal injections of active compounds and a computer-assisted quantification of behavior) can be used to functionally characterize these receptors. We observed that injection of double-stranded RNA complementary to GABA(B)R1 into adult Drosophila selectively destroys GABA(B)R1 mRNA and attenuates the behavioral actions of the GABA(B) agonist, 3-aminopropyl-(methyl)phosphinic acid. Moreover, both GABA(B)R1 RNAi and the GABA(B) antagonist CGP 54626 reduced the behavior-impairing effects of ethanol, suggesting a putative role for the Drosophila GABA(B) receptors in alcohol's mechanism of action. The Drosophila model we have developed can be used for further in vivo functional characterization of GABA(B) receptor subunits and their involvement in the molecular and systemic actions of addictive substances.",2003,"Svetlana Dzitoyeva, Nikola Dimitrijevic, Hari Manev, Svetlana Dzitoyeva, Nikola Dimitrijevic, Hari Manev"

Binding of these proteins results in the appearance of condensed chromatin and late replication of DNA, which in turn may result in DNA underreplication.

Death was accompanied by widespread tissue damage. M. marinum initially proliferated inside the phagocytes of the fly; later in infection, bacteria were found both inside and outside host cells. Intracellular M. marinum blocked vacuolar acidification and failed to colocalize with dead Escherichia coli, similar to infections of mouse macrophages. M. marinum lacking the mag24 gene were less virulent, as determined both by LD(50) and by death kinetics.

In the wing of D. melanogaster, these clines are generally based on latitudinal variation in cell number.

To investigate possible reasons for the different cellular bases of these two types of evolutionary response, we compared the newly established North and South American wing size clines of Drosophila subobscura. The new clines are based on latitudinal variation in cell area in North America and cell number in South America. The ancestral European cline is also based on latitudinal variation in cell number. The difference in the cellular basis of wing size variation in the American clines, which are roughly the same age, together with the similar cellular basis of the new South American cline and the ancient European one, suggest that the antiquity of a cline does not explain its cellular basis. Furthermore, the results indicate that wing size as a whole, rather than its cellular basis, is under selection. The different cellular bases of different size clines are most likely explained either entirely by chance or by different patterns of genetic variance--or its expression--in founding populations.",2003,"Federico C F Calboli, George W Gilchrist, Linda Partridge, Federico C F Calboli, George W Gilchrist, Linda Partridge"

In order to investigate its evolutionary history, we analyzed the patterns of DNA polymorphism among the S-element copies present in a sample genome (Drosophila Genome Project). The observed levels of nucleotide diversity are significantly lower than theoretical expectations based on the neutral model. This is consistent with evidence for ongoing gene conversion among copies and for purifying selection on the elements' sequences, particularly on the terminal inverted repeats. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that the members of the S-element family can be grouped into at least two genetically differentiated clusters. The level of divergence between these clusters suggests that the S elements invaded the genome of the ancestor of D. melanogaster before the speciation of the D. melanogaster complex.

Telomerase-independent mechanisms of telomere elongation,14625679,10.1007/s00018-003-3247-9,"The ends of linear chromosomes must be elongated in a DNA-replication-independent fashion. For chromosome end elongation the majority of eukaryotes use a specialized reverse transcriptase, telomerase, which adds a short, tandemly repeated DNA sequence motif to chromosome ends. Chromosome elongation can also be achieved, however, by mechanisms other than telomerase. Such elongation events have been detected under conditions where telomerase has been inactivated experimentally and in the few organisms that naturally lack telomerase. We will summarize current knowledge on these telomerase-independent elongation mechanisms in yeast and mammalian cells and will discuss in more detail the telomere elongation mechanism by retrotransposons in Drosophila melanogaster.",2003,"H Biessmann, J M Mason, H Biessmann, J M Mason"
"Masters change, slaves remain",12508274,10.1002/bies.10207,"Sex determination offers an opportunity to address many classic questions of developmental biology. In addition, because sex determination evolves rapidly, it offers an opportunity to investigate the evolution of genetic hierarchies. Sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster is controlled by the master regulatory gene, Sex lethal (Sxl). DmSxl controls the alternative splicing of a downstream gene, transformer (tra), which acts with tra2 to control alternative splicing of doublesex (dsx). DmSxl also controls its own splicing, creating an autoregulatory feedback loop that ensures expression of Sxl in females, but not males. A recent paper has shown that in the dipteran Ceratitis capitata later (downstream) steps in the regulatory hierarchy are conserved, while earlier (upstream) steps are not. Cctra is regulated by alternative splicing and apparently controls the alternative splicing of Ccdsx. However, Cctra is not regulated by CcSxl. Instead it appears to autoregulate in a manner similar to the autoregulation seen with DmSxl.",2003,"Patricia Graham, Jill K M Penn, Paul Schedl, Patricia Graham, Jill K M Penn, Paul Schedl"
Assessing the Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae genome annotations using genome-wide sequence comparisons,12840038,10.1101/gr.922503,"We performed genome-wide sequence comparisons at the protein coding level between the genome sequences of Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae. Such comparisons detect evolutionarily conserved regions (ecores) that can be used for a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the available annotations of both genomes. They also provide novel candidate features for annotation. The percentage of ecores mapping outside annotations in the A. gambiae genome is about fourfold higher than in D. melanogaster. The A. gambiae genome assembly also contains a high proportion of duplicated ecores, possibly resulting from artefactual sequence duplications in the genome assembly. The occurrence of 4063 ecores in the D. melanogaster genome outside annotations suggests that some genes are not yet or only partially annotated.

"Dlg, Scrib and Lgl regulate neuroblast cell size and mitotic spindle asymmetry",12545176,10.1038/ncb922,"Asymmetric cell division is important in generating cell diversity from bacteria to mammals. Drosophila melanogaster neuroblasts are a useful model system for investigating asymmetric cell division because they establish distinct apical-basal cortical domains, have an asymmetric mitotic spindle aligned along the apical-basal axis, and divide unequally to produce a large apical neuroblast and a small basal daughter cell (GMC). Here we show that Discs large (Dlg), Scribble (Scrib) and Lethal giant larvae (Lgl) tumour suppressor proteins regulate multiple aspects of neuroblast asymmetric cell division. Dlg/Scrib/Lgl proteins show apical cortical enrichment at prophase/metaphase, and then have a uniform cortical distribution. Mutants have defects in basal protein targeting, a reduced apical cortical domain and reduced apical spindle size. Defects in apical cell and spindle pole size result in symmetric or inverted neuroblast cell divisions. Inverted divisions correlate with the appearance of abnormally small neuroblasts and large GMCs, showing that neuroblast/GMC identity is more tightly linked to cortical determinants than cell size. We conclude that Dlg/Scrib/Lgl are important in regulating cortical polarity, cell size asymmetry and mitotic spindle asymmetry in Drosophila neuroblasts.",2003,"Roger Albertson, Chris Q Doe, Roger Albertson, Chris Q Doe"
Noncircadian regulation and function of clock genes period and timeless in oogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster,14667147,10.1177/0748730403259108,"Circadian clock genes are ubiquitously expressed in the nervous system and peripheral tissues of complex animals. While clock genes in the brain are essential for behavioral rhythms, the physiological roles of these genes in the periphery are not well understood. Constitutive expression of the clock gene period was reported in the ovaries of Drosophila melanogaster; however, its molecular interactions and functional significance remained unknown. This study demonstrates that period (per) and timeless (tim) are involved in a novel noncircadian function in the ovary. PER and TIM are constantly expressed in the follicle cells enveloping young oocytes. Genetic evidence suggests that PER and TIM interact in these cells, yet they do not translocate to the nucleus. The levels of TIM and PER in the ovary are affected neither by light nor by the lack of clock-positive elements Clock (Clk) and cycle (cyc). Taken together, these data suggest that per and tim are regulated differently in follicle cells than in clock cells. Experimental evidence suggests that a novel fitness-related phenotype may be linked to noncircadian expression of clock genes in the ovaries. Mated females lacking either per or tim show nearly a 50% decline in progeny, and virgin females show a similar decline in the production of mature oocytes. Disruption of circadian mechanism by either the depletion of TIM via constant light treatment or continuous expression of PER via GAL4/UAS expression system has no adverse effect on the production of mature oocytes.",2003,"L M Beaver, B L Rush, B O Gvakharia, J M Giebultowicz, L M Beaver, B L Rush, B O Gvakharia, J M Giebultowicz"
Genetic variability of sexual size dimorphism in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster: an isofemale-line approach,15133187,10.1007/BF02715810,"Most animal species exhibit sexual size dimorphism (SSD). SSD is a trait difficult to quantify for genetical purposes since it must be simultaneously measured on two kinds of individuals, and it is generally expressed either as a difference or as a ratio between sexes. Here we ask two related questions: What is the best way to describe SSD, and is it possible to conveniently demonstrate its genetic variability in a natural population? We show that a simple experimental design, the isofemale-line technique (full-sib families), may provide an estimate of genetic variability, using the coefficient of intraclass correlation. We consider two SSD indices, the female-male difference and the female/male ratio. For two size-related traits, wing and thorax length, we found that both SSD indices were normally distributed. Within each family, the variability of SSD was estimated by considering individual values in one sex (the female) with respect to the mean value in the other sex (the male). In a homogeneous sample of 30 lines of Drosophila melanogaster, both indices provided similar intraclass correlations, on average 0.21, significantly greater than zero but lower than those for the traits themselves: 0.50 and 0.36 for wing and thorax length respectively. Wing and thorax length were strongly positively correlated within each sex. SSD indices of wing and thorax length were also positively correlated, but to a lesser degree than for the traits themselves. For comparative evolutionary studies, the ratio between sexes seems a better index of SSD since it avoids scaling effects among populations or species, permits comparisons between different traits, and has an unambiguous biological significance. In the case of D. melanogaster grown at 25 degrees C, the average female/male ratios are very similar for the wing (1.16) and the thorax (1.15), and indicate that, on average, these size traits are 15-16% longer in females.",2003,"Jean R David, Patricia Gibert, Sandrine Mignon-Grasteau, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Legout, Georges PÃ©tavy, Catherine Beaumont, Brigitte Moreteau, Jean R David, Patricia Gibert, Sandrine Mignon-Grasteau, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Legout, Georges PÃ©tavy, Catherine Beaumont, Brigitte Moreteau"
Antioxidant function of a novel selenoprotein in Drosophila melanogaster,14750951,10.1046/j.1365-2443.2003.00687.x,"Background:
      
    

    
      Insects appear to have diverged from both higher and lower organisms in their defense mechanisms against oxidative damage. They do not encode glutathione peroxidases or glutathione reductases, and their thioredoxin reductases exhibit distinct properties from those of higher and lower species. Nonetheless, appropriate balance of anti-oxidants and pro-oxidants, and protection from damaging reactive oxygen species are clearly crucial in insects for viability, normal functioning of signalling pathways and morphogenesis, and have been implicated in studies on longevity in flies and other organisms.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Two novel selenoproteins, dselH and dselK, were recently identified in Drosophila melanogaster. We have used RNAi in D. melanogaster embryos and in Schneider S2 cells to inhibit expression of these proteins. We report that inhibition of either dselH or dselK expression significantly reduces viability in embryos. We further show that dselH silencing decreases total anti-oxidant capacity in embryos and Schneider cells, and increases lipid peroxidation in cells. Conversely, transient expression of dselH in the cell line decreases lipid peroxidation, and reverses the toxic effects of a glutathione-depleting drug. The latter correlates with sparing of glutathione levels.

Polymorphism and divergence in the Mst26A male accessory gland gene region in Drosophila,1361475,,"Drosophila males, like males of most other insects, transfer a group of specific proteins to the females during mating. These proteins are produced primarily in the accessory gland and are likely to influence the female's reproduction. The results of studies of DNA sequence polymorphism and divergence in two genes coding for male accessory gland proteins of Drosophila are reported here. The Mst26Aa and Mst26Ab transcription units are tandemly arranged in a approximately 1.6-kb segment in Drosophila sechellia, Drosophila mauritiana and Drosophila simulans as they were reported to be in Drosophila melanogaster. The DNA sequences of 10 alleles from D. melanogaster and one allele each from the three sibling species reveals a high degree of amino acid replacement variation. A substantial part of the variation is due to insertion/deletion differences. Possible functional significance of these amino acid sequence changes is discussed. Statistical analyses based on the neutral theory of molecular evolution show that the distribution of polymorphism over the 1.6-kb region is inconsistent with the pattern of divergence between the species. The amount of 4-cutter restriction map polymorphism in a larger sample of 75 alleles from the same D. melanogaster population is similar to that obtained from the DNA sequence of the 10 alleles (a pairwise average of 0.007 difference per site). The 6-cutter restriction map survey of a 18-kb region containing the Mst26A genes indicates that polymorphism in the region flanking these genes maybe higher. The failure of polymorphisms and divergence in the Mst26A region to conform to the expectations of a simple mutation-drift-equilibrium model indicates that selection in or near this region has played a role in the history of these genes.",1992,"M AguadÃ©, N Miyashita, C H Langley, M AguadÃ©, N Miyashita, C H Langley"
"NKD, a developmentally regulated tachykinin receptor in Drosophila",1370464,,"A number of neuropeptides have been described which are present in the insect nervous system. The physiological role of these neuropeptides has not yet been clarified. We have characterized a Drosophila melanogaster cDNA coding for a protein, NKD, whose sequence resembles that of mammalian G protein-coupled neuropeptide receptors. This protein shows 38% homology with the mammalian tachykinin NK3 receptor within the transmembrane domain region. Stable cell lines expressing this cDNA are responsive to Locusta migratoria tachykinin but not to other peptides of the tachykinin family. The expression of this gene is detected principally in adult fly heads, but also in the adult body and in embryos. Interestingly, NKD mRNA is detected at very early stages of Drosophila embryonic development (3 h) and reaches the highest level of expression at 12-16 h, a time which correlates with the period of major neuronal development. In situ hybridization experiments demonstrate that NKD is expressed in the central nervous system, as well as in subsets of neurons in each segment of the developing ventral ganglia. The cytological localization of this gene is at position 86C on the Drosophila third chromosome.",1992,"D Monnier, J F Colas, P Rosay, R Hen, E Borrelli, L Maroteaux, D Monnier, J F Colas, P Rosay, R Hen, E Borrelli, L Maroteaux"

The results indicate that both positive and negative regulatory elements can function when transferred from D. grimshawi to D. melanogaster. The first ca. 100 bp of the 5'-flanking DNA region constitute a minimal, developmentally regulated promoter, expression of which is inhibited by the next 100-bp DNA segment and activated by positive elements located further upstream.

Two mRNAs encoding aldolase contain three exons and differ only in the poly(A) site. The first exon is small and noncoding. The second encodes the first 332 amino acids, which form the catalytic domain, and is homologous to exons 2 through 8 of vertebrates. The third exon encodes the last 29 amino acids, thought to control substrate specificity, and is homologous to vertebrate exon 9. A third mRNA substitutes a different 3' exon (4a) for exon 3 and encodes a protein very similar to aldolase. A fourth mRNA begins at a different promoter and shares the second exon with the aldolase messages. However, two exons, 3a and 4a, together substitute for exon 3. Like exon 4a, exon 3a is homologous to terminal aldolase exons. The exon 3a-4a junction is such that exon 4a would be translated in a frame different from that which would produce a protein with similarity to aldolase. The putative proteins encoded by the third and fourth mRNAs are likely to be aldolases with altered substrate specificities, illustrating alternate use of duplicated and diverged exons as an evolutionary mechanism for adaptation of enzymatic activities.",1992,"J Kim, J J Yim, S Wang, D Dorsett, J Kim, J J Yim, S Wang, D Dorsett"
Spatial and temporal expression of the I factor during oogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,1330483,,"The I factor is a functional non-viral retrotransposon, or LINE, from Drosophila melanogaster. Its mobility is associated with the I-R hybrid dysgenesis. In order to study the expression pattern of this LINE in vivo, a translational fusion between the first ORF of the I factor and the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli has been carried out and introduced in the genome of reactive (R) flies. Homozygous transgenic Drosophila lines have been established and analysed. ORF1 expression is limited to germ-line cells (nurse cells and oocyte) between stage 2 and 10 of oogenesis. No somatic expression is found. Position effects may limit the level of expression of a given transgene but do not modify its basic pattern of expression during the development of the fly. This reproducible control demonstrates both that I factor is driven by its own promoter, probably the internal one suggested by Mizrokhi et al. (Mizrokhi, L.J., Georgevia, S.G. and Ilying, Y.V. (1988). Cell 54, 685-691), and that tissue-specific regulatory sequences are present in the 5' untranslated part of the I factor. The nuclear localization of the fusion protein reveals the presence of nuclear localization signals (NLS) in the ORF1-encoded protein correlating with the possible structural and/or regulatory role of this protein. This expression is restricted to dysgenic and reactive females, and is similar in the two conditions. All the results obtained in this work suggest that I factor transposition occurs as a meiotic event, between stage 2 and 10 of the oogenesis and is regulated at the transcriptional level.

vestigial suppressor genes and resistance to aminopterin in Drosophila melanogaster,1428957,10.1038/hdy.1992.152,"We have shown that the vestigial (vg) mutant of D. melanogaster has a perturbed nucleotide metabolism compared to various wild-type strains. The mutant is particularly spontaneously resistant to aminopterin. The resistance seems to correlate with an increase in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) activity and quantity. The DHRF is a target enzyme of aminopterin. Our results suggest that the vg+ gene could be a regulatory gene acting on the DHFR gene. The wing mutant phenotype being due to a decrease in the thymidylate pool (dTMP) (Silber et al., 1989). In order to understand better the action of the mutant gene on nucleotide metabolism, we have induced suppressor genes of the mutant phenotype by mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and bromouridine (BUR). The suppressor strains obtained display a phenotype intermediate between wild-type and vg phenotype. The action of three independent suppressor genes on eight parameters of nucleotide metabolism is reported here [three enzyme activities, resistance to aminopterin and to fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR), auxotrophy test and the ability to use exogenous thymidine and uridine]. In comparison to the original vg strain, major changes for the parameters tested are observed. The most striking effects are obtained with the vgBUR27 strain, which is highly sensitive to aminopterin and to fluorodeoxyuridine and didplas the highest thymidine kinase (TK) and DHFR activities within the strains tested.

Transposable DNA elements and life history traits. I. Transposition of P DNA elements in somatic cells reduces the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster,1334906,10.1007/BF00133717,"As an initial study of the influence of transposable DNA elements on life history traits, and as a model system for estimating the impact of somatic genetic damage on longevity, the effect of P DNA element movement in somatic cells on adult lifespan was measured in Drosophila melanogaster males. Lifespan was significantly reduced in males that contained the somatically active P[ry+ delta 2-3](99B) element and 17, 4, 3, but not just a single P element. Furthermore, there appears to be a direct correlation between the number of transposing P elements and the amount of lifespan reduction. This reduction in lifespan observed in males with somatically active P elements is probably due to genetic damage in embryos, larvae and pupae from P-element excisions and insertions, leading to changes in gene structure and regulation, chromosome breakage, and subsequent cell death in adults. This hypothesis is supported in this study by a significant increase in recessive sex-linked lethal mutations in the same males that had reduced lifespans and by the previous observation of chromosome breakage in somatic cells of similar males. The evolutionary implications of these results are discussed, including the possible influence of somatic DNA transpositions on fitness and other life history traits.",1992,"R C Woodruff, R C Woodruff"

Estimates of VM averaged over males and females both from divergence among lines and from response to selection within lines were 3.3 ? 10-3 VE for abdominal bristles and 1.5 ? 10-3 VE for sternopleural bristles, where VE is the environmental variance. The actual rate of production of mutations affecting these traits may be considerably higher if the traits are under stabilizing selection, and if mutations affecting bristle number have deleterious effects on fitness. There was a substantial component of variance for sex ? mutant effect interaction and the sublines evolved highly significant mutational variation in sex dimorphism of abdominal bristle number. Pleiotropic effects on sex dimorphism may be a general property of mutations at loci determining bristle number.",1992,"Trudy F C Mackay, Richard F Lyman, Michael S Jackson, Christophe Terzian, William G Hill, Trudy F C Mackay, Richard F Lyman, Michael S Jackson, Christophe Terzian, William G Hill"

Sequence comparisons suggest that the mariner element was present in the ancestor of the species subgroup and was lost in some of the lineages. Most species contain both active and inactive mariner elements. A deletion of most of the 3' end characterizes many elements in D. teissieri, but in other species the inactive elements differ from active ones only by simple nucleotide substitutions or small additions/deletions. Active mariner elements from all species are quite similar in nucleotide sequence, although there are some species-specific differences.

Fourteen restriction-site and 28 length polymorphisms were detected. There was some indication of population subdivision for North American vs. European samples of D. melanogaster. The frequency spectrum of restriction-site polymorphisms in European populations was skewed toward rarer frequencies than predicted by the neutral theory. Comparison of silent site variation at this telomeric region with that in the Adh 5'-flanking region showed a reduced level of heterozygosity in the y-ac-sc region. Since interspecific silent divergence is not reduced in the y-ac-sc region as compared to other regions, the reduction in standing levels of variation at this telomeric locus in both D. simulans and D. melanogaster is most easily explained by a hitchhiking effect of linked selected substitutions.",1992,"J M MartÃ­n-Campos, J M ComerÃ³n, N Miyashita, M AguadÃ©"

The rate and pattern of nucleotide substitution in Drosophila mitochondrial DNA,1528108,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040763,"The nucleotide sequences of a segment of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been determined for nine species or subspecies of the subgenus Drosophila of the genus Drosophila. This segment contains two complete protein-coding genes (i.e., NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 and cytochrome b) and a transfer RNA gene (tRNA(ser)). The G+C content at third-codon positions for the two protein-coding genes was 1.5 times higher than that in the D. melanogaster species group, which belongs to the subgenus Sophophora. However, there was a substantial difference between the nucleotide frequencies of G and C. The number of nucleotide substitutions per silent site was more than three times higher than that for nuclear DNA, although it was only 60% of that for mammalian mtDNA. Both parametric and nonparametric analyses revealed a strong transition-transversion bias in nucleotide substitution, as was observed in mammalian mtDNA. Moreover, the rate of substitution of A and T for G and C is higher than that for the opposite direction. This bias seems to be responsible for the extremely A+T-rich base composition of Drosophila mtDNA. It is also noted that the rate of transitional change between A and G is higher than that between T and C.",1992,"K Tamura, K Tamura"

The D. melanogaster rpL17A gene is single copy and maps at 58F6-59A3, a chromosome region encompassing a previously characterized Minute locus, M(2)I. Despite this extensive homology in their protein products, the D. melanogaster and yeast rpL17A genes display different exon-intron structures, with the first D. melanogaster intron mapping within the 5'-untranslated mRNA leader. The rpL17A gene gives rise to a single 600-nucleotide transcript present throughout development, and is located close to another similarly expressed gene.

Microgravity effects on Drosophila melanogaster development and aging: comparative analysis of the results of the Fly experiment in the Biokosmos 9 biosatellite flight,11536953,10.1016/0273-1177(92)90279-7,"The results are presented of the exposure of Drosophila melanogaster to microgravity conditions during a 15-day biosatellite flight, Biokosmos 9, in a joint ESA-URSS project. The experimental containers were loaded before launch with a set of Drosophila melanogaster Oregon R larvae so that imagoes were due to emerge half-way through the flight. A large number of normally developed larvae were recovered from the space-flown containers. These larvae were able to develop into normal adults confirming earlier results that Drosophila melanogaster of a wild-type constitution can develop normally in the absence of gravity. However, microgravity exposure clearly enhances the number of growing embryos laid by the flies and possibly slows down the developmental pace of the microgravity-exposed animals. Due to some problems in the experimental set-up, this slowing down needs to be verified in future experiments. No live adult that had been exposed to microgravity was recovered from the experiment, so that no life span studies could be carried out, but adult males emerged from the recovered embyros showed a slight shortening in life span and a lower performance in other experimental tests of aging. This agrees with the results of previous experiments performed by our groups.",1992,"R Marco, J GonzÃ¡lez-Jurado, M Calleja, R Garesse, M Maroto, E RamÃ­rez, M C Holgado, E de Juan, J Miquel, R Marco, J GonzÃ¡lez-Jurado, M Calleja, R Garesse, M Maroto, E RamÃ­rez, M C Holgado, E de Juan, J Miquel"

The functional properties of wild-type (WT) and mutant DmInsP3Rs have recently been described [Srikanth et al., Biophys. J. 86 (2004) 3634-3646]. Here, we use the planar lipid bilayer reconstitution technique to describe single channel properties of a ka901 point mutant (G2630S) in the pore-forming region of DmInsP3R. We find that homomeric ka901 channels are not functional, but the heteromeric WT:ka901 mutant channels display increased conductance, longer channel open time and altered ion selectivity properties when compared to WT DmInsP3R. Obtained results are consistent with the gain of function phenotype observed in ka901/+ mutant flies.",2004,"Sonal Srikanth, Zhengnan Wang, Gaiti Hasan, Ilya Bezprozvanny, Sonal Srikanth, Zhengnan Wang, Gaiti Hasan, Ilya Bezprozvanny"

This 1045 amino acid protein possesses a zinc finger domain with a tandem array of four FLYWCH zinc finger motifs at its N-terminus and a C-terminal domain that shares a 46% homology with GST. The gene maps to chromosome 3 at position 84C6. Further characterization of this protein shows that it localizes to the cytoplasm of fly cells and is expressed through all stages of fly embryonic development.

Evaluation of the genotoxicity of four herbicides in the wing spot test of Drosophila melanogaster using two different strains,14706518,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2003.09.010,"In the present study, the herbicides bentazone, molinate, thiobencarb and trifluralin were evaluated for mutagenic and recombinagenic effects using the wing spot test of Drosophila melanogaster (somatic mutation and recombination test, SMART). Both standard (ST) and high-bioactivation (HB) fly crosses were used, the latter cross is characterised by a high sensitivity to promutagens and procarcinogens. Three-day-old larvae, transheterozygous for the multiple wing hairs (mwh, 3-0.3) and flare-3 (flr(3), 3-38.8) genes, were chronically fed with six different concentrations of each herbicide. Feeding ended with pupation of the surviving larvae and the genetic changes induced in somatic cells of the wing's imaginal discs lead to the formation of mutant clones on the wing blade. Point mutation, chromosome breakage and mitotic recombination produce single spots; while twin spots are produced only by mitotic recombination. Bentazone, usually considered as a non-mutagen, gave positive results in the wing spot test with the high-bioactivation cross. Molinate, about which information on mutagenic effects is inconclusive, gave positive responses in both the standard and the high-bioactivation crosses, while the other thiocarbamate, thiobencarb, gave positive results only in the standard cross and at the highest concentration tested (10 mM). Finally, trifluralin, one of the most widely studied herbicides for genotoxic effects, gave positive results in the wing spot test with both crosses. Apart from the interest of the results found in the genotoxic evaluation of the four selected herbicides, our results also contribute to extend the existing database on the Drosophila wing spot test, and corroborate the utility of the use of high-bioactivation strains for the genotoxic evaluation of xenobiotics.",2004,"BÃ¼lent Kaya, Ricardo Marcos, Atila Yaniko?lu, Amadeu Creus, BÃ¼lent Kaya, Ricardo Marcos, Atila Yaniko?lu, Amadeu Creus"
Phenotypic stability of the P-M system in wild populations of Drosophila melanogaster,15056932,10.1266/ggs.79.9,"The P element appears to be one of the most recently invaded transposons of D. melanogaster. To study the dynamics and long-term fate of P elements in natural populations of D. melanogaster, 472 isofemale lines newly collected from 27 localities of Japan were examined for the P element-associated characteristics (abilities to induce and repress of P element transposition) and genomic P element composition (size classes and their numbers). There was variation in the P element-related phenotypes among local populations, but genomic P composition did not correlate strongly with the phenotype of each line: full-size P and KP elements predominated in their genomes (FP+ KP predominance). Comparison with previous results suggests a stability in the P-M system in local populations over about 15 years. In some populations, phenotypic stability for particularly long times was found: for 30 years or more Q strains predominated in Hikone and Tanushimaru, P or Q strains around Inakadate, and M' or Q strains around Tozukawa. There was no clear evidence of structural destruction underlying functional variation of P elements during this period.

Intramolecular recombination in S2 cells on transfected plasmid DNA carrying the attB and attP recognition sites occurred at a frequency of 47%. In addition, several endogenous pseudo attP sites were identified in the fly genome that were recognized by the integrase and used as substrates for integration in S2 cells. Two lines of Drosophila were created by integrating an attP site into the genome with a P element. phiC31 integrase injected into embryos as mRNA functioned to promote integration of an attB-containing plasmid into the attP site, resulting in up to 55% of fertile adults producing transgenic offspring. A total of 100% of these progeny carried a precise integration event at the genomic attP site. These experiments demonstrate the potential for precise genetic engineering of the Drosophila genome with the phiC31 integrase system and will likely benefit research in Drosophila and other insects.",2004,"Amy C Groth, Matthew Fish, Roel Nusse, Michele P Calos, Amy C Groth, Matthew Fish, Roel Nusse, Michele P Calos"

EMS is particularly useful to researchers because it creates mutations independent of position effects. However, because researchers have little control over the chromosomal site of mutation, post-mutagenic genetic mapping is required to determine the cytological location of the mutation. To make a valuable set of mutants more useful to the research community, we have mapped the uncharacterized part of the female-sterile - maternal-effect lethal Tubingen collection. We mapped 49 female-sterile - maternal-effect lethal alleles and 72 lethal alleles to individual deficiency intervals on the third chromosome. In addition, we analyzed the phenotype of ovaries resulting from female sterile mutations. The observed phenotypes range from tumorous ovaries and early blocks in oogenesis, to later blocks, slow growth, blocks in stage 10, to apparently full development of the ovary.

As parents within an isofemale line were unknown, a total of 500 parental pedigrees were simulated and mean estimates computed. Full and half sibs were distinguished, in contrast to usual isofemale studies in which animals were all treated as half sibs and hence heritability was overestimated. Heritability was thus estimated at 0.33, 0.38, 0.30 and 0.33 for male and female wing length and male and female thorax length, respectively, whereas corresponding estimates obtained using analysis of variance were 0.46, 0.54, 0.35 and 0.38. Genetic correlations between male and female traits were 0.85 and 0.62 for wing and thorax length, respectively. Sexual dimorphism and the ratio of female to male traits were moderately heritable (0.30 and 0.23 for wing length, 0.38 and 0.23 for thorax length). Both were moderately and positively correlated with female traits, and weakly and negatively correlated with male traits.

A specific alteration in the electroretinogram of Drosophila melanogaster is induced by halothane and other volatile general anesthetics,15155332,10.1213/01.ane.0000113548.27457.a3,"In higher organisms, physiological investigations have provided a valuable complement to assays of anesthetic effects on whole-animal behavior. However, although complex motor programs of Drosophila melanogaster have been used to identify genes that influence anesthesia, electrophysiological studies of anesthetic effects in this invertebrate have been limited. Here we show that the electroretinogram (ERG), the extracellular recording of light-evoked mass potentials from the surface of the eye, reveals a distinct effect of halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, and desflurane. Behaviorally relevant concentrations of these volatile anesthetics severely reduced the transient component of the ERG at lights-off. Other prominent ERG components, such as the photoreceptor potential and the lights-on transient, were not consistently affected by these drugs. Surprisingly, for most anesthetics, a diminished off-transient was obtained only with short light pulses. An identical effect was observed in the absence of anesthetic by depressing the function of Shaker potassium channels. The possibility that halothane acts in the visual circuit by closing potassium channels was examined with a simple genetic test; the results were consistent with the hypothesis but fell short of providing definitive support. Nevertheless, our studies establish the ERG as a useful tool both for examining the influence of volatile anesthetics on a simple circuit and for identifying genes that contribute to anesthetic sensitivity.

Despite their seeming reversibility, nothing is known about the mechanism of gene fission. Because the nucleotide sequences of fission genes record little about their origination process, conventional analysis of duplicate genes may not be powerful enough to unravel the underlying mechanism. In a survey for young genes in species of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we identified a young gene family, monkey king, whose genesis sheds light on the evolutionary process of gene fission. Its members originated 1-2 million years ago as retroposed duplicates and evolved into fission genes that separately encode protein domains from a multidomain ancestor.

Primary characterization and basal promoter activity of two hexamerin genes of Musca domestica,15861218,10.1093/jis/4.1.2,"Hexamerins are high molecular-weight proteins found in the hemolymph of insects and have been proposed to function as storage proteins. In previous studies, two Musca domestica hexamerins, designated Hex-L and Hex-F were characterized. Hex-L is synthesized exclusively by the larval fat bodies, is secreted into the hemolymph and likely provides a source of amino acids and energy during metamorphosis. Hex-F synthesis is induced by a proteinaceous meal and occurs only in the adult insect fat bodies. Hex-F also is secreted into the hemolymph and it has been suggested that in females it may be an amino acid reservoir to be used during the final stages of egg formation. Genomic clones containing full-length copies of the genes MdHexL1 and MdHexF1, encoding subunits of the larval and the adult female hexamerin, respectively, were isolated. Complete nucleotide sequences, including the 5'-end untranscribed regions, were determined and analyzed for each of the genes. Comparisons of the conceptual translation products of the cloned genes indicated that MdHexL1 and MdHexF1 are related to the larval serum proteins (LSP) 1 and 2 of Calliphora vicina and Drosophila melanogaster.

Previous genetic analyses established that omb plays a key role in establishing the abdominal pigmentation pattern of Drosophila melanogaster. In this report we examine patterns of omb nucleotide variation in D. polymorpha, a species that is highly polymorphic for the phenotype of abdominal pigmentation. Haplotypes at this locus fall into two classes that are separated by six mutational steps; five of these mutational events result in amino acid changes. Two lines of evidence are consistent with a role for omb in the abdominal pigmentation polymorphism of D. polymorpha. First, we find that haplotype classes of omb are correlated with abdominal pigmentation phenotypes, as are microsatellite repeat numbers in the region. Second, tests of selection reveal that the two haplotype classes have been maintained by balancing selection. Within each class there is a significantly low amount of diversity, indicative of previous selective sweeps. An analysis including D. polymorpha's closest relatives (members of the cardini group) provides evidence for directional selection across species. Selection at this locus is expected if omb contributes to variation in abdominal pigmentation, since this trait is likely of ecological importance.",2004,"Jennifer A Brisson, Alan R Templeton, Ian Duncan, Jennifer A Brisson, Alan R Templeton, Ian Duncan"
Incipient evolution of Wolbachia compatibility types,15521450,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2004.tb00478.x,"Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) is induced in arthropods by the maternally inherited bacterium Wolbachia. When infected males mate with uninfected females or with females bearing a different Wolbachia variant, paternal chromosomes behave abnormally and embryos die. This pattern can be interpreted as resulting from two bacterial effects: One (usually termed mod, for modification) would affect sperm and induce embryo death, unless Wolbachia is also present in the egg, which implies the existence of a second effect, usually termed resc, for rescue. The fact that CI can occur in crosses between males and females infected by different Wolbachia shows that mod and resc interact in a specific manner. In other words, different compatibility types, or mod/resc pairs seem to have diverged from one (or a few) common ancestor(s). We are interested in the process allowing the evolution of mod/resc pairs. Here this question is addressed experimentally after cytoplasmic injection into a single host species (Drosophila simulans) by investigating compatibility relationships between closely related Wolbachia variants naturally evolving in different dipteran hosts: D. simulans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Rhagoletis cerasi.

Here we present evidence that they converge at the level of the terminal regulator, doublesex ( dsx), which conveys the selected sexual fate to the differentiation genes. The dsx homologue in Musca, Md-dsx, encodes male-specific (MdDSX(M)) and female-specific (MdDSX(F)) protein variants which correspond in structure to those in Drosophila. Sex-specific regulation of Md-dsx is controlled by the switch gene F via a splicing mechanism that is similar but in some relevant aspects different from that in Drosophila. MdDSX(F) expression can activate the vitellogenin genes in Drosophila and Musca males, and MdDSX(M) expression in Drosophila females can cause male-like pigmentation of posterior tergites, suggesting that these Musca dsx variants are conserved not only in structure but also in function. Furthermore, downregulation of Md-dsx activity in Musca by injecting dsRNA into embryos leads to intersexual differentiation of the gonads. These results strongly support a role of Md-dsx as the final regulatory gene in the sex-determining hierarchy of the housefly.",2004,"Monika Hediger, GÃ©za Burghardt, Christina Siegenthaler, Nathalie Buser, Denise Hilfiker-Kleiner, Andreas DÃ¼bendorfer, Daniel Bopp, Monika Hediger, GÃ©za Burghardt, Christina Siegenthaler, Nathalie Buser, Denise Hilfiker-Kleiner, Andreas DÃ¼bendorfer, Daniel Bopp"

The data obtained suggest that the FB and EB are involved: 1) in maintenance of a high courtship activity level, 2) in the control of accuracy of male following movements when courting a female, 3) in the control of the form and stability of sound elements in courtship songs, 4) in the control of the rhythmic structure of courtship songs determined by the stability of the pacemakers, and 5) in setting up a correspondence between the current behavior and the external situation.",2004,"A V Popov, A I Peresleni, P V Ozerskii, E E Shchekanov, E V Savvateeva-Popova, A V Popov, A I Peresleni, P V Ozerskii, E E Shchekanov, E V Savvateeva-Popova"
Mitotic and polytene chromosomes: comparisons between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,15088654,10.1023/b:gene.0000017637.10230.c4,"This review deals with the differences between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans in their mitotic and polytene chromosomes.

The polytene chromosomes karyotypes are known for many years to differ by a major paracentric inversion on chromosome 3 and minor few differences. The main difference take place in their chromosomal polymorphism: D. melanogaster is highly polymorphic while D. simulans has long been known to be a monomorphic species.

Comparative investigation between acetylcholinesterase obtained from commercial sources and genetically modified Drosophila melanogaster: application in amperometric biosensors for methamidophos pesticide detection,15522598,10.1016/j.bios.2004.03.021,"Genetically modified acetylcholinesterase (AChE) from Drosophila melanogaster (dm) and from commercial sources, Electric eel (ee), Bovine erythrocites (be) and Human erythrocites (he), were investigated as biological receptors for the detection of methamidophos pesticide based on inhibition studies. Most engineered variant of AChE from dm showed enhanced sensitivity toward methamidophos pesticide. Among 24 dmAChE variants tested, 12 presented a sensitivity comparable to the commercially available eeAChE, but higher than AChEs from be and he. Four were found more sensitive and six others were insensitive to methamidophos insecticide. The D375G,Y370F,Y374A,F376L mutant was the most sensitive, with a ki value of 2.2 X 10(6) mol(-1) L min(-1), three orders of magnitude higher than eeAChE (1.1 X 10(3) mol(-1) L min(-1)). The sensor constructed with genetically modified enzyme showed better characteristics with respect to detection limit and sensitivity compared with those using commercial eeAChE. Differential pulse polarography and chronoamperometry were used as electrochemical techniques to characterize the AChE biosensors. The lower detection limit of 1 ppb was obtained with D375G,Y370F,Y374A,F376L mutant of dmAChE, compared to 90 ppb for the commercial eeAChE.

The effect of mutations altering biogenic amine metabolism in Drosophila on viability and the response to environmental stresses,14745823,10.1002/arch.10123,"Dopamine (DA) content, tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC) activity and survival were studied under normal and environmental stress conditions in the ste and e strains carrying ebony mutation increasing DA level and the octopamineless strain Tbetah(nM18) of Drosophila melanogaster. Wild-type strains Canton S and Oregon R, and strain p845 from which Tbetah(nM18) strain was derived were used as controls. Sexual dimorphism of TDC activity, DA content, and survival in flies of all D. melanogaster strains under study was found. Tbetah(nM18) mutation sharply reduced TDC activity in females, while ebony had no such effect. DA content and survival under heat stress in Tbetah(nM18) flies did not differ from those in the wild type. ste and e flies had drastically increased DA content under normal conditions, dramatically decreased survival under heat stress, but increased survival under starvation. DA content and survival under heat stress were also studied in the reciprocal hybrids (males) F(1) of the cross D. virilis strains 101 (wild type) and 147 with X-linked mutation, which significantly increases DA content. 147x101 males had a considerably higher DA content and lower survival than 101x147 ones. Individuals of all D. melanogaster strains under study developed the stress reaction, as judged by changes in TDC activity and DA levels.

[Study of male mating behavior in some Drosophila melanogaster strains in experiments with fertilized females],15458200,,"Male courtship ritual is among the main behavioral characteristics of Drosophila. This is a complex, genetically determined process consisting of four general stages: orientation, vibration, licking, and attempts at copulation (or successful copulation). Several genes are known that control some stages of this behavior. Most of them have pleiotropic effects and are involved in other biological processes. Earlier, we have shown that a mutation in locus flamenco (20A1-3), which controls transposition and infectivity of retrotransposon gypsy (MDG4), is involved in the genetic control of behavior. In strains mutant for this locus, the male mating activity is decreased and the structure of courtship ritual is changed. To understand the mechanisms of these changes, it is important to study all behavioral stages in genetically identical strains. For this purpose, the normal allele of gene flamenco from the X chromosome of the wild-type strain (stock) Canton S was introduced into strain SS carrying flamMS.

The gene product of CG6178 (CG6178) in Drosophila melanogaster genome, which has a high sequence similarity to firefly luciferase, has been expressed and characterized. CG6178 showed long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetic activity in the presence of ATP, CoA and Mg(2+), suggesting a fatty acyl adenylate is an intermediate. Recently, it was revealed that firefly luciferase has two catalytic functions, monooxygenase (luciferase) and AMP-mediated CoA ligase (fatty acyl-CoA synthetase). However, unlike firefly luciferase, CG6178 did not show luminescence activity in the presence of firefly luciferin, ATP, CoA and Mg(2+). The enzymatic properties of CG6178 including substrate specificity, pH dependency and optimal temperature were close to those of firefly luciferase and rat fatty acyl-CoA synthetase.

Bioassay-guided isolation of the chloroform extract of A. acutiloba against larvae of Drosophila melanogaster afforded two phthalides, (Z)-butylidenephthalide (1) and (Z)-ligustilide (2), and two furanocoumarins, xanthotoxin (3) and isopimpinellin (4). The structures of these compounds were established by spectroscopic analysis. The isolated compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 exhibited LC(50) values of 0.94, 2.54, 3.35, and 0.82 micromol/mL of diet concentration against larvae of D. melanogaster, respectively. Against both sexes (males/females, 1:1) of adults (5-7 days old), compound 1 showed the most potent activity with a LD(50) value of 0.84 microg/adult. Compound 1 is a more active insecticide than rotenone (LD(50) = 3.68 microg/adult) and has potential as a novel insect control agent. However, compound 2 was inactive against adults. The structure-activity relationship of phthalides isolated indicated that the aromaticity appeared to play an important role in the activity of both larvae and adults. To determine the insecticide mode of action for acute adulticidal activity, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity was also investigated in vitro, and the result indicated that the acute adulticidal activity of compounds 3 and 4 was due to the inhibition of AChE.",2004,"Mitsuo Miyazawa, Toshihiko Tsukamoto, Jun Anzai, Yukio Ishikawa, Mitsuo Miyazawa, Toshihiko Tsukamoto, Jun Anzai, Yukio Ishikawa"

Preliminary characterization of two atypical soluble guanylyl cyclases in the central and peripheral nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster,15159437,10.1242/jeb.01025,"Conventional soluble guanylyl cyclases form alpha/beta heterodimers that are activated by nitric oxide (NO). Recently, atypical members of the soluble guanylyl cyclase family have been described that include the rat beta2 subunit and MsGC-beta3 from Manduca sexta. Predictions from the Drosophila melanogaster genome identify three atypical guanylyl cyclase subunits: Gyc-88E (formerly CG4154), Gyc-89Da (formerly CG14885) and Gyc-89Db (formerly CG14886). Preliminary data showed that transient expression of Gyc-88E in heterologous cells generated enzyme activity in the absence of additional subunits that was slightly stimulated by the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) but not the NO donor DEA-NONOate or the NO-independent activator YC-1. Gyc-89Db was inactive when expressed alone but when co-expressed with Gyc-88E enhanced the basal and SNP-stimulated activity of Gyc-88E, suggesting that they may form heterodimers in vivo. Here, we describe the localization of Gyc-88E and Gyc-89Db and show that they are expressed in the embryonic and larval central nervous systems and are colocalized in several peripheral neurons that innervate trachea, basiconical sensilla and the sensory cones in the posterior segments of the embryo. We also show that there are two splice variants of Gyc-88E that differ by seven amino acids, although no differences in biochemical properties could be determined.

Several other sites indicate marginal association with one or more other aspects of shape. No strong effects of sex or population of origin were detected with measures of shape, but two different sites were strongly associated with overall wing size in interaction with these fixed factors. Whole-gene sequencing in very large samples, rather than selective genotyping, would appear to be the only strategy likely to be successful for detecting subtle associations in species with high polymorphism and little haplotype structure.

Genetics of egg production in Drosophila sechellia,14710171,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800401,"Drosophila sechellia, an island endemic that specializes on a single host plant, has a lower rate of egg production than its generalist sister species D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. mauritiana. Earlier work showed that part of this difference in egg production was due to a reduction in the number of ovarioles in D. sechellia relative to its sister species. Here, I extend this earlier work by genetically analyzing the difference in egg production between D. sechellia and D. simulans. In all, 10 genetic markers were used in several interspecific backcrosses to identify chromosome regions that affected the rate of egg production. While previously mapped factors affecting ovariole number appear to impact the rate of egg production, new, non-ovariole factors were also identified. Overall, the difference in egg production between D. sechellia and D. simulans appears to be a polygenic trait. The relationship between these factors and genes involved the adaptation of D. sechellia to its host plant is not yet clear. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that decline in egg production is, in part, a negative pleiotropic effect of genetic changes required for host specialization in D. sechellia, although finer-scale genetic analysis of both traits is needed to truly test this hypothesis.",2004,"C D Jones, C D Jones"
The Drosophila GAGA factor is required for dosage compensation in males and for the formation of the male-specific-lethal complex chromatin entry site at 12DE,15020425,10.1534/genetics.166.1.279,"Drosophila melanogaster males have one X chromosome, while females have two. To compensate for the resulting disparity in X-linked gene expression between the two sexes, most genes from the male X chromosome are hyperactivated by a special dosage compensation system. Dosage compensation is achieved by a complex of at least six proteins and two noncoding RNAs that specifically associate with the male X. A central question is how the X chromosome is recognized. According to a current model, complexes initially assemble at approximately 35 chromatin entry sites on the X and then spread bidirectionally along the chromosome where they occupy hundreds of sites. Here, we report that mutations in Trithorax-like (Trl) lead to the loss of a single chromatin entry site on the X, male lethality, and mislocalization of dosage compensation complexes.",2004,"Anthony J Greenberg, Judith L Yanowitz, Paul Schedl, Anthony J Greenberg, Judith L Yanowitz, Paul Schedl"
A genetic screen identifies putative targets and binding partners of CREB-binding protein in the developing Drosophila eye,15998717,10.1534/genetics.105.045450,"Drosophila CREB-binding protein (dCBP) is a very large multidomain protein, which belongs to the CBP/p300 family of proteins that were first identified by their ability to bind the CREB transcription factor and the adenoviral protein E1. Since then CBP has been shown to bind to >100 additional proteins and functions in a multitude of different developmental contexts. Among other activities, CBP is known to influence development by remodeling chromatin, by serving as a transcriptional coactivator, and by interacting with terminal members of several signaling transduction cascades. Reductions in CBP activity are the underlying cause of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, which is, in part, characterized by several eye defects, including strabismus, cataracts, juvenile glaucoma, and coloboma of the eyelid, iris, and lens. Development of the Drosophila melanogaster compound eye is also inhibited in flies that are mutant for CBP. However, the vast array of putative protein interactions and the wide-ranging roles played by CBP within a single tissue such as the retina can often complicate the analysis of CBP loss-of-function mutants. Through a series of genetic screens we have identified several genes that could either serve as downstream transcriptional targets or encode for potential CBP-binding partners and whose association with eye development has hitherto been unknown. The identification of these new components may provide new insight into the roles that CBP plays in retinal development. Of particular interest is the identification that the CREB transcription factor appears to function with CBP at multiple stages of retinal development.",2005,"Jason Anderson, Rohan Bhandari, Justin P Kumar, Jason Anderson, Rohan Bhandari, Justin P Kumar"
Genotoxicity of neutrons in Drosophila melanogaster.

This test was used for evaluating the biological effects induced by neutrons from the Triga Mark III reactor of Mexico. Two different reactor power levels were used, 300 and 1000 kW, and two absorbed doses were tested for each power level: 1.6 and 3.2 Gy for 300 kW and 0.84 and 1.7 Gy for 1000 kW. A linear relationship was observed between the absorbed dose and the somatic mutation and recombination frequencies. Furthermore, these frequencies were dependent on larval age: In 96-h-old larvae, the frequencies were increased considerably but the sizes of the spots were smaller than in 72-h-old larvae. The analysis of the balancer-heterozygous progeny showed a linear absorbed dose- response relationship, although the responses were clearly lower than found in the marker-trans-heterozygous flies. Approximately 65% of the genotoxicity observed is due to recombinational events. The results of the study indicate that thermal and fast neutrons are both mutagenic and recombinagenic in the D. melanogaster wing SMART, and that the frequencies are dependent on neutron dose, reactor power, and the age of the treated larvae.",2005,"J GuzmÃ¡n-RincÃ³n, A DelfÃ­n-Loya, F UreÃ±a-NÃºÃ±ez, L C Paredes, F Zambrano-Achirica, U Graf, J GuzmÃ¡n-RincÃ³n, A DelfÃ­n-Loya, F UreÃ±a-NÃºÃ±ez, L C Paredes, F Zambrano-Achirica, U Graf"

Identification of germ plasm-enriched mRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster by the cDNA microarray technique,15939385,10.1016/j.modgep.2005.02.004,"The development of embryonic germ cells in Drosophila depends on the germ plasm, the most posterior part of the ooplasm. The germ plasm is devoted to the formation of future germ cells and is known to contain all the factors that are necessary to induce germ cell fate. Besides having a characteristic organelle and protein distribution, the germ plasm also contains a large number of localized RNA species that have been shown to play crucial roles in germ cell determination. To identify germ plasm-enriched, localized transcripts, we used a two-step method composed of cDNA microarray (containing 3200 annotated Drosophila cDNAs) and in situ RNA hybridization techniques. We compared germ plasm deficient, normal and ectopic germ plasm conditions in the cDNA microarray experiments. RNA species whose concentration increased when ectopic germ plasm was present and decreased when the germ plasm was missing were selected. These candidates were then subjected to a second screen which compared the distribution of the given RNA in wild type embryos and in eggs with ectopic germ plasm. Finally, 17 RNA species were found to be enriched in the germ plasm. Based on these data, we estimate that around 1% of the Drosophila genes encode for germ plasm-enriched, localized transcripts.

Between-site genetic variation in ovariole number was negatively correlated with altitude on both slopes of the canyon, and collections from the north- and south-facing slopes were genetically differentiated for male, but not female, body size.

To ascribe a functional role to this domain, we created two chimeric myosin isoforms (indirect flight isoform-exon 7a and embryonic-exon 7d) that differ from the native indirect flight muscle and embryonic body-wall muscle isoforms only in the exon 7 region. Germline transformation and subsequent expression of the chimeric myosins in the indirect flight muscle of myosin-null Drosophila allowed us to purify the myosin for in vitro studies and to assess in vivo structure and function of transgenic muscles. Intriguingly, in vitro experiments show the exon 7 domain modulates myosin ATPase activity but has no effect on actin filament velocity, a novel result compared to similar studies with other Drosophila variable exons. Transgenic flies expressing the indirect flight isoform-exon 7a have normal indirect flight muscle structure, and flight and jump ability. However, expression of the embryonic-exon 7d chimeric isoform yields flightless flies that show improvements in both the structural stability of the indirect flight muscle and in locomotor abilities as compared to flies expressing the embryonic isoform. Overall, our results suggest the exon 7 domain participates in the regulation of the attachment of myosin to actin in order to fine-tune the physiological properties of Drosophila myosin isoforms.",2005,"Becky M Miller, Shuxing Zhang, Jennifer A Suggs, Douglas M Swank, Kimberly P Littlefield, Aileen F Knowles, Sanford I Bernstein, Becky M Miller, Shuxing Zhang, Jennifer A Suggs, Douglas M Swank, Kimberly P Littlefield, Aileen F Knowles, Sanford I Bernstein"
piggyBac internal sequences are necessary for efficient transformation of target genomes,15663772,10.1111/j.1365-2583.2004.00525.x,"A previously reported piggyBac minimal sequence cartridge, which is capable of efficient transposition in embryo interplasmid transposition assays, failed to produce transformants at a significant frequency in Drosophila melanogaster compared with full-length or less extensive internal deletion constructs. We have re-examined the importance of these internal domain (ID) sequences for germline transformation using a PCR strategy that effectively adds increasing lengths of ID sequences to each terminus. A series of these piggyBac ID synthetic deletion plasmids containing the 3xP3-ECFP marker gene are compared for germline transformation of D. melanogaster. Our analyses identify a minimal sequence configuration that is sufficient for movement of piggyBac vectored sequences from plasmids into the insect genome. Southern hybridizations confirm the presence of the piggyBac transposon sequences, and insertion site analyses confirm these integrations target TTAA sites. The results verify that ID sequences adjacent to the 5' and 3' terminal repeat domains are crucial for effective germline transformation with piggyBac even though they are not required for excision or interplasmid transposition. Using this information we reconstructed an inverted repeat cartridge, ITR1.1k, and a minimal piggyBac transposon vector, pXL-BacII-ECFP, each of which contains these identified ID sequences in addition to the terminal repeat configuration previously described as essential for mobility. We confirm in independent experiments that these new minimal constructs yield transformation frequencies similar to the control piggyBac vector. Sequencing analyses of our constructs verify the position and the source of a point mutation within the 3' internal repeat sequence of our vectors that has no apparent effect on transformation efficiency.",2005,"X Li, R A Harrell, A M Handler, T Beam, K Hennessy, M J Fraser Jr, X Li, R A Harrell, A M Handler, T Beam, K Hennessy, M J Fraser Jr"
Evidence for a global Wolbachia replacement in Drosophila melanogaster,16085497,10.1016/j.cub.2005.06.069,"Wolbachia are maternally inherited intracellular alpha-Proteobacteria found in numerous arthropod and filarial nematode species. They influence the biology of their hosts in many ways. In some cases, they act as obligate mutualists and are required for the normal development and reproduction of the host. They are best known, however, for the various reproductive parasitism traits that they can generate in infected hosts. These include cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) between individuals of different infection status, the parthenogenetic production of females, the selective killing of male embryos, and the feminization of genetic males. Wolbachia infections of Drosophila melanogaster are extremely common in both wild populations and long-term laboratory stocks. Utilizing the newly completed genome sequence of Wolbachia pipientis wMel, we have identified a number of polymorphic markers that can be used to discriminate among five different Wolbachia variants within what was previously thought to be the single clonal infection of D. melanogaster. Analysis of long-term lab stocks together with wild-caught flies indicates that one of these variants has replaced the others globally within the last century. This is the first report of a global replacement of a Wolbachia strain in an insect host species. The sweep is at odds with current theory that cannot explain how Wolbachia can invade this host species given the observed cytoplasmic incompatibility characteristics of Wolbachia infections in D. melanogaster in the field.",2005,"Markus Riegler, Manpreet Sidhu, Wolfgang J Miller, Scott L O'Neill, Markus Riegler, Manpreet Sidhu, Wolfgang J Miller, Scott L O'Neill"

The expression level and enzymatic activity of recombinant prolyl 4-hydroxylase produced in the Drosophila expression system were significantly higher than those produced in the T. ni system. We further characterized the involvement of prolyl 4-hydroxylase in the assembly of the three alpha chains to form trimeric type XXI minicollagen, which comprises the intact C-terminal non-collagenous (NC1) and collagenous domain (COL1), in the Drosophila system. When minicollagen XXI was stably expressed in Drosophila S2 cells alone, negligible amounts of interchain disulfide-bonded trimers were detected in the culture media. However, minicollagen XXI was secreted as disulfide-bonded homotrimers by coexpression with prolyl 4-hydroxylase in the stably transfected Drosophila S2 cells. Minicollagen XXI coexpressed with prolyl 4-hydroxylase contained sufficient amounts of hydroxyproline to form thermal stable pepsin-resistant triple helices consisting of both interchain and non-interchain disulfide-bonded trimers. These results demonstrate that a sufficient amount of active prolyl 4-hydroxylase is required for the assembly of type XXI collagen triple helices in Drosophila cells and the trimeric assembly is governed by the C-terminal collagenous domain.",2005,"Hsiu-Chuan Li, Chuan-Chuan Huang, Sung-Fang Chen, Min-Yuan Chou, Hsiu-Chuan Li, Chuan-Chuan Huang, Sung-Fang Chen, Min-Yuan Chou"
Resistance to oxidative stress induced by paraquat correlates well with both decreased and increased lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster,16518700,10.1007/s10522-005-4903-2,"There is increasing support for the notion that genetic variation for lifespan, both within and between species, is correlated with variation in the efficiency of the free radical scavenging system and the ability to withstand oxidative stress. In Drosophila, resistance to dietary paraquat, a free radical generator, is often used as a measure of resistance to oxidative stress and is reported to give firm positive correlations with longevity. Recently it has been suggested that an increase in antioxidative defences in Drosophila only has a beneficial effect in relatively short-lived stocks. This implies that mechanisms of lifespan determination can be different in lines with different genetic constitution. Here we test if variation in resistance to dietary paraquat co-segregates with variation in lifespan in two sets of Drosophila melanogaster lines that were selected for decreased and increased virgin lifespan respectively. Flies of the short-lived lines show decreased resistance to paraquat compared to the control lines, indicating low resistance against oxidative stress. On the other hand, both males and females of the long-lived lines show, despite increased feeding rates on paraquat-supplemented food, no decreased survival compared to control lines. This shows that flies of the long-lived lines have increased paraquat resistance, but that this is masked by increased feeding rate, resulting in increased exposure to paraquat. This suggests that resistance to paraquat is a correlated response to selection on virgin lifespan over the entire genetic range.",2005,"C J Vermeulen, L Van De Zande, R Bijlsma, C J Vermeulen, L Van De Zande, R Bijlsma"

We report here the physiological effects of these factors on host haemocytes using in vivo injection experiments. The total number of haemocytes, the number of plasmatocytes and the number of crystal cells were not modified by injection of long gland extracts. In contrast, long gland extracts either from virulent or avirulent strains had a significant effect on the lamellocyte number. Compared to the Ringer control, the avirulent long gland products induced an increase of the lamellocyte number while virulent extracts induced a drastic decrease together with an alteration of the morphology of these cells. Interestingly, changes in the lamellocyte morphology were also observed following injection of the P4 protein, a major component of L. boulardi female long glands that displays a strong immune suppressive effect on Drosophila larvae.

Subdivision of large introns in Drosophila by recursive splicing at nonexonic elements,15802507,10.1534/genetics.104.039701,"Many genes with important roles in development and disease contain exceptionally long introns, but special mechanisms for their expression have not been investigated. We present bioinformatic, phylogenetic, and experimental evidence in Drosophila for a mechanism that subdivides many large introns by recursive splicing at nonexonic elements and alternative exons. Recursive splice sites predicted with highly stringent criteria are found at much higher frequency than expected in the sense strands of introns >20 kb, but they are found only at the expected frequency on the antisense strands, and they are underrepresented within introns <10 kb. The predicted sites in long introns are highly conserved between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura, despite extensive divergence of other sequences within the same introns. These patterns of enrichment and conservation indicate that recursive splice sites are advantageous in the context of long introns. Experimental analyses of in vivo processing intermediates and lariat products from four large introns in the unrelated genes kuzbanian, outspread, and Ultrabithorax confirmed that these introns are removed by a series of recursive splicing steps using the predicted nonexonic sites. Mutation of nonexonic site RP3 within Ultrabithorax also confirmed that recursive splicing is the predominant processing pathway even with a shortened version of the intron. We discuss currently known and potential roles for recursive splicing.",2005,"James M Burnette, Etsuko Miyamoto-Sato, Marc A Schaub, Jamie Conklin, A Javier Lopez, James M Burnette, Etsuko Miyamoto-Sato, Marc A Schaub, Jamie Conklin, A Javier Lopez"
Recombination enhances protein adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster,16169487,10.1016/j.cub.2005.07.065,"Evolutionary theory predicts that the rate and level of adaptation will be enhanced in sexual relative to asexual genomes because sexual recombination facilitates the elimination of deleterious mutations and the fixation of beneficial ones by natural selection. To date, the most compelling evidence for this prediction comes from experimental evolution studies and from loci completely lacking recombination, such as those on Y chromosomes, which often show reduced adaptation and even degeneration. Here, by analyzing replacement and silent DNA polymorphism and divergence at 98 loci, I show that recombination increases the efficacy of protein adaptation throughout the genome of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Genes residing in genomic regions with reduced recombination rates suffer a greater load of segregating, mildly deleterious mutations and fix fewer beneficial mutations than genes residing in regions with higher recombination rates. These findings suggest that the capacity to respond to natural selection varies with recombination rate across the genome, consistent with theory on the evolutionary advantages of sex and recombination.",2005,"Daven C Presgraves, Daven C Presgraves"
Variants of the Drosophila melanogaster Ih-channel are generated by different splicing,15804582,10.1016/j.ibmb.2005.02.001,"We isolated splice variants of the DMIH cDNA encoding members of the I(h)-channel family from Drosophila melanogaster by means of polymerase chain reaction and homology screening.

The variants so obtained code for ion channel proteins with long or short N-termini and variations in the length of the interloop regions between the membrane-spanning domains S3-S4 and S4-S5. The multiple variants of DMIH coded by a single gene thus might form the molecular basis for a variety of I(h)-channels. Functional expression of one of the DMIH variants with a long N-terminus in HEK293 cells produced unitary currents that were preferentially selective for potassium over sodium ions and were activated by hyperpolarizing voltage steps. Cyclic nucleotides shifted the voltage activation curve to more positive membrane potentials. The current kinetics and modulatory influence of cyclic nucleotides resemble closely those of other invertebrate I(h)-channels, but activation by hyperpolarizing voltage steps had a V(1/2) of 123 mV, a more negative value than those of other recombinantly expressed insect I(h)-channels with a short N-terminus.",2005,"GÃ¼nter Gisselmann, Birgit Gamerschlag, Ralf Sonnenfeld, Thomas Marx, Eva M Neuhaus, Christian H Wetzel, Hanns Hatt, GÃ¼nter Gisselmann, Birgit Gamerschlag, Ralf Sonnenfeld, Thomas Marx, Eva M Neuhaus, Christian H Wetzel, Hanns Hatt"

Tum/RacGAP50C provides a critical link between anaphase microtubules and the assembly of the contractile ring in Drosophila melanogaster,16280552,10.1242/jcs.02652,"A central question in understanding cytokinesis is how the cleavage plane is positioned. Although the positioning signal is likely to be transmitted via the anaphase microtubule array to the cell cortex, exactly how the microtubule array determines the site of contractile ring formation remains unresolved. By analysing tum/RacGAP50C mutant Drosophila embryos we show that cells lacking Tum do not form furrows and fail to localise the key cytokinetic components Pebble (a RhoGEF), Aurora B kinase, Diaphanous, Pav-KLP and Anillin. The GAP activity of Tum is required for cytokinesis: in its absence cytokinesis fails early even though Tum is present on microtubules at the cell equator where the furrow should form. Disruption of the Pebble-interacting domain leaves Tum localised to the cell equator on cortically associated microtubules, again with no evidence of furrowing.

Quantitative genetics of natural variation of behavior in Drosophila melanogaster: the possible role of the social environment on creating persistent patterns of group activity,16153038,,"Using a set of nine effectively isogenic lines collected from nature in 1998, we observed unperturbed behaviors of mixed-sex groups of Drosophila melanogaster. We repeatedly scanned replicated groups of genetically identical individuals, five females and five males, and recorded the behavior of each individual (i.e., walking, feeding, grooming, flying, courting, mating, fighting, or resting). From these behaviors, we made a composite variable of activity for our quantitative genetic analysis. Genotypes differed in activity, explaining 14.41% of the variation in activity; 8.60% of the variation was explained by a significant genotype x sex interaction, which signifies genetic variation for sexual dimorphism in behavior. Phenotypic plasticity explained 11.13% of the variation in activity. Different genotypes and sexes within genotypes had different rank orders of the component behaviors that contribute to activity. We found no effect of common rearing environment. Instead, differences between replicate groups within genotype accounted for 19.47% variation in activity, and activity was significantly repeatable across scans. This emergent group behavior is likely caused by differences between groups of interacting individuals, even though individuals were genetically identical across groups. Thus, emergent group behavior explained almost as much variation in activity as the combined sources of genetic variation (23.01%), and this is an additional level on which selection could operate: individuals and groups. We discuss how differences among groups could change patterns of additive genetic variation available for evolution. Furthermore, because the behavior of an individual is influenced by conspecifics, genotype interactions between individuals could contribute to indirect selection. Finally, if we consider activity as a syndrome governing all component behaviors with strong genetic correlations among behaviors within an individual, then these component behaviors cannot evolve independently. These results suggest that reductionist approaches of molecular behavior genetics may be incomplete and/or misleading when considering similar phenotypes at the population level or when trying to understand how behaviors evolve.",2005,"Laura A Higgins, Kelly M Jones, Marta L Wayne, Laura A Higgins, Kelly M Jones, Marta L Wayne"

Far from being static, HeT-A and TART evolve faster than Drosophila euchromatic genes. In spite of their high rate of sequence change, HeT-A and TART maintain their basic structures and unusual individual features. The maintenance of their separate identities suggests that HeT-A and TART cooperate either in the process of retrotransposition onto the chromosome end, or in the formation of telomere chromatin by transposed DNA copies.

It requires either Mg2+ or Mn2+ divalent cations, and works in basic pH, with a peak at around pH9. The so-called [RT-RH] polypeptide displays an optimal activity at 22 degrees C, a property that makes it well-adapted to the temperature of its host.

Genomic heterogeneity of background substitutional patterns in Drosophila melanogaster,15520267,10.1534/genetics.104.032250,"Mutation is the underlying force that provides the variation upon which evolutionary forces can act. It is important to understand how mutation rates vary within genomes and how the probabilities of fixation of new mutations vary as well. If substitutional processes across the genome are heterogeneous, then examining patterns of coding sequence evolution without taking these underlying variations into account may be misleading. Here we present the first rigorous test of substitution rate heterogeneity in the Drosophila melanogaster genome using almost 1500 nonfunctional fragments of the transposable element DNAREP1_DM. Not only do our analyses suggest that substitutional patterns in heterochromatic and euchromatic sequences are different, but also they provide support in favor of a recombination-associated substitutional bias toward G and C in this species. The magnitude of this bias is entirely sufficient to explain recombination-associated patterns of codon usage on the autosomes of the D. melanogaster genome. We also document a bias toward lower GC content in the pattern of small insertions and deletions (indels). In addition, the GC content of noncoding DNA in Drosophila is higher than would be predicted on the basis of the pattern of nucleotide substitutions and small indels. However, we argue that the fast turnover of noncoding sequences in Drosophila makes it difficult to assess the importance of the GC biases in nucleotide substitutions and small indels in shaping the base composition of noncoding sequences.",2005,"Nadia D Singh, Peter F Arndt, Dmitri A Petrov, Nadia D Singh, Peter F Arndt, Dmitri A Petrov"
Induction of cAMP response element-binding protein-dependent medium-term memory by appetitive gustatory reinforcement in Drosophila larvae,16135747,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2135-05.2005,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been successfully used as a model animal for the study of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of learning and memory.

In this paper, we describe a novel paradigm of larval associative learning with a single odor and a positive gustatory reinforcer, sucrose. Mutant analyses have suggested importance of cAMP signaling and potassium channel activities in larval learning as has been demonstrated with the adult fly. Intriguingly, larval memory produced by the appetitive conditioning lasts medium term and depends on both amnesiac and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB).

Here, we apply this approach using microfluidics to investigate the robust network in Drosophila melanogaster that compensates for variation in the Bicoid morphogen gradient. We show that the compensation system can counteract the effects of extremely unnatural environmental conditions--a temperature step--in which the anterior and posterior halves of the embryo are developing at different temperatures and thus at different rates. Embryonic patterning was normal under this condition, suggesting that a simple reciprocal gradient system is not the mechanism of compensation. Time-specific reversals of the temperature step narrowed down the critical period for compensation to between 65 and 100 min after onset of embryonic development. The microfluidic technology used here may prove useful to future studies, as it allows spatial and temporal regulation of embryonic development.",2005,"Elena M Lucchetta, Ji Hwan Lee, Lydia A Fu, Nipam H Patel, Rustem F Ismagilov, Elena M Lucchetta, Ji Hwan Lee, Lydia A Fu, Nipam H Patel, Rustem F Ismagilov"
Expression of COPI components during development of Drosophila melanogaster,16169286,10.1016/j.modgep.2005.06.001,"In a P{lArB} enhancer detector collection, a line was found that showed upregulated expression within centrally to posteriorly located germarial cysts. It was inserted in the gammaCOP locus on chromosome 3R. GammaCOP is a component of the COPI coatomer involved in membrane traffic. Most of the other known components of the COPI coatomer also showed higher expression in the posterior half of the germarium. Not only meiotic germline cysts but also migrating follicle cells upregulate the COPI subunits. During embryonic and larval development, the COPI subunits are expressed ubiquitously as expected for genes required for cell viability. In addition, they are strongly expressed in the salivary glands and the proventriculus. Whether tissue-specific transcriptional upregulation of COPI subunits is required for the reorganization of membranous compartments that are needed for the developmental processes that confer cyst polarity and follicle maturation will have to be addressed in a genetic study.",2005,"Nicole C Grieder, Urs Kloter, Walter J Gehring, Nicole C Grieder, Urs Kloter, Walter J Gehring"
Limitation of size by hypoxia in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,16217805,10.1002/jez.a.211,"The size of an organism is of fundamental importance in all biological processes. It dictates many of the critical interactions and physical factors that delimit the envelope within which an organism can grow. We investigated the effects of reduced oxygen on size and development in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and showed that limiting the oxygen in the environment limits both whole animal and cell size. When oxygen levels were reduced from 20% in nitrogen to 15%, 10% and 7.5%, there was a linear decrease in both male and female mass. Both cell size and cell number decreased in low oxygen, but changes in cell size accounted for a larger proportion of the overall change in fly size. Cell numbers decreased by a maximum of 11% between flies reared in 20% oxygen and those reared in 7.5% oxygen, whereas cell surface area decreased by 17%. Low oxygen levels increased development time and mortality, but reduced fecundity. Reducing the level of oxygen available significantly slowed development times, with flies reared in 10% oxygen emerging on average 1.5 days later than those in 20% oxygen. The effect of oxygen on size is reversible during embryonic and larval development up to the pupal stage, when final size is set.",2005,"Lloyd S Peck, Simon H P Maddrell, Lloyd S Peck, Simon H P Maddrell"
DNA sequence polymorphism and divergence at the erect wing and suppressor of sable loci of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans,15944367,10.1534/genetics.104.033456,"Several evolutionary models of linked selection (e.g., genetic hitchhiking, background selection, and random environment) predict a reduction in polymorphism relative to divergence in genomic regions where the rate of crossing over per physical distance is restricted. We tested this prediction near the telomere of the Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans X chromosome at two loci, erect wing (ewg) and suppressor of sable [su(s)]. Consistent with this prediction, polymorphism is reduced at both loci, while divergence is normal. The reduction is greater at ewg, the more distal of the two regions. Two models can be discriminated by comparing the observed site frequency spectra with those predicted by the models. The hitchhiking model predicts a skew toward rare variants in a sample, while the spectra under the background-selection model are similar to those of the neutral model of molecular evolution. Statistical tests of the fit to the predictions of these models require many sampled alleles and segregating sites. Thus we used SSCP and stratified DNA sequencing to cover a large number of randomly sampled alleles (approximately 50) from each of three populations. The result is a clear trend toward negative values of Tajima's D, indicating an excess of rare variants at ewg, the more distal of the two loci. One fixed difference among the populations and high FST values indicate strong population subdivision among the three populations at ewg. These results indicate genetic hitchhiking at ewg, in particular, geographically localized hitchhiking events within Africa. The reduction of polymorphism at su(s) combined with the excess of high-frequency variants in D. simulans is inconsistent with the hitchhiking and background-selection models.",2005,"John M Braverman, Brian P Lazzaro, Montserrat AguadÃ©, Charles H Langley, John M Braverman, Brian P Lazzaro, Montserrat AguadÃ©, Charles H Langley"
Evidence for sequestration of polyglutamine inclusions by Drosophila myeloid leukemia factor,15936212,10.1016/j.mcn.2005.04.005,"Intracellular inclusions of abnormally long polyglutamine tracts and neurotoxicity are the hallmarks of several hereditary neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD).

In transfected primary rat neuronal cultures, dMLF and its orthologs reduced the morphological phenotypes and inclusions.

Genetic architecture of two fitness-related traits in Drosophila melanogaster: ovariole number and thorax length,16247693,10.1007/s10709-005-8549-4,"In Drosophila melanogaster, ovariole number and thorax length are morphological characters thought to be associated with fitness. Maximum daily egg production in females is positively correlated with ovariole number, while thorax length is correlated with male reproductive success and female fecundity. Though both traits are related to fitness, ovariole number is likely to be under stabilizing selection, while thorax length appears to be under directional selection. Current research has focused on examining the sources of variation for ovariole number in relation to fitness, with a view towards elucidating how segregating variation is maintained in natural populations. Here, we utilize a diallel design to explore the genetic architecture of ovariole number and thorax length in nine isogenic lines derived from a natural population. The full diallel design allows the estimation of general combining ability (GCA), specific combining ability (SCA), and also describes variation due to reciprocal effects (RGCA and RSCA). Ovariole number and thorax length differed with respect to their genetic architecture, reflective of the independent selective forces acting on the traits. For ovariole number, GCA accounted for the majority (67.3%) of variation segregating between the lines, with no evidence of reciprocal effects or inbreeding depression; SCA accounted for a small percentage (3.9%) of the variance, suggesting dominance variation; no reciprocal effects were observed. In contrast, for thorax length, the majority of the non-error variance was accounted for by SCA (17.9%), with only one third as much variance (6.2%) due to GCA. Interestingly, RSCA (nuclear-extranuclear interactions) accounted for slightly more variation (7.5%) than GCA in these data. Thus, genetic variation for thorax length is largely in accord with predictions for a fitness trait under directional selection: little additive genetic variation and substantial dominance variation (including a suggestion of inbreeding depression); while the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of variation for ovariole number are more complex.",2005,"M Telonis-Scott, L M McIntyre, M L Wayne, M Telonis-Scott, L M McIntyre, M L Wayne"

Drosophila melanogaster NEP2 is a new soluble member of the neprilysin family of endopeptidases with implications for reproduction and renal function,15554877,10.1042/BJ20041753,"The mammalian neprilysin (NEP) family members are typically type II membrane endopeptidases responsible for the activation/inactivation of neuropeptides and peptide hormones. Differences in substrate specificity and subcellular localization of the seven mammalian NEPs contribute to their functional diversity. The sequencing of the Drosophila melanogaster genome has revealed a large expansion of this gene family, resulting in over 20 fly NEP-like genes, suggesting even greater diversity in structure and function than seen in mammals. We now report that one of these genes (Nep2) codes for a secreted endopeptidase with a highly restricted pattern of expression. D. melanogaster NEP2 is expressed in the specialized stellate cells of the renal tubules and in the cyst cells that surround the elongating spermatid bundles in adult testis, suggesting roles for the peptidase in renal function and in spermatogenesis. D. melanogaster NEP2 was found in vesicle-like structures in the syncytial cytoplasm of the spermatid bundles, suggesting that the protein was acquired by endocytosis of protein secreted from the cyst cells. Expression of NEP2 cDNA in D. melanogaster S2 cells confirmed that the peptidase is secreted and is only weakly inhibited by thiorphan, a potent inhibitor of human NEP. D. melanogaster NEP2 also differs from human NEP in the manner in which the peptidase cleaves the tachykinin, GPSGFYGVR-amide. Molecular modelling suggests that there are important structural differences between D. melanogaster NEP2 and human NEP in the S1' and S2' ligand-binding subsites, which might explain the observed differences in inhibitor and substrate specificities. A soluble isoform of a mouse NEP-like peptidase is strongly expressed in spermatids, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for a soluble endopeptidase in spermatogenesis.",2005,"Josie E Thomas, Caroline M Rylett, Ahmet Carhan, Nicholas D Bland, Richard J Bingham, Alan D Shirras, Anthony J Turner, R Elwyn Isaac"
The RNA silencing endonuclease Argonaute 2 mediates specific antiviral immunity in Drosophila melanogaster,17079687,10.1101/gad.1482006,"Most organisms have evolved defense mechanisms to protect themselves from viruses and other pathogens. Arthropods lack the protein-based adaptive immune response found in vertebrates. Here we show that the central catalytic component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), the nuclease Argonaute 2 (Ago-2), is essential for antiviral defense in adult Drosophila melanogaster. Ago-2-defective flies are hypersensitive to infection with a major fruit fly pathogen, Drosophila C virus (DCV), and with Cricket Paralysis virus (CrPV). Increased mortality in ago-2 mutant flies was associated with a dramatic increase in viral RNA accumulation and virus titers. The physiological significance of this antiviral mechanism is underscored by our finding that DCV encodes a potent suppressor of RNA interference (RNAi). This suppressor binds long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and inhibits Dicer-2-mediated processing of dsRNA into short interfering RNA (siRNA), but does not bind short siRNAs or disrupt the microRNA (miRNA) pathway. Based on these results we propose that RNAi is a major antiviral immune defense mechanism in Drosophila.",2006,"Ronald P van Rij, Maria-Carla Saleh, Bassam Berry, Catherine Foo, Andrew Houk, Christophe Antoniewski, Raul Andino, Ronald P van Rij, Maria-Carla Saleh, Bassam Berry, Catherine Foo, Andrew Houk, Christophe Antoniewski, Raul Andino"
The association between inversion In(3R)Payne and clinally varying traits in Drosophila melanogaster,17028965,10.1007/s10709-006-7375-7,"In Drosophila melanogaster, inversion In(3R)Payne increases in frequency towards low latitudes and has been putatively associated with variation in size and thermal resistance, traits that also vary clinally. To assess the association between size and inversion, we obtained isofemale lines of inverted and standard karyotype of In(3R)Payne from the ends of the Australian D. melanogaster east coast cline. In the northern population, there was a significant association between In(3R)Payne and body size, with standard lines from this population being relatively larger than inverted lines. In contrast, the inversion had no influence on development time or cold resistance. We strengthened our findings further in a separate study with flies from populations from the middle of the cline as well as from the cline ends. These flies were scored for wing size and the presence of In(3R)Payne using a molecular marker. In females, the inversion accounted for around 30% of the size difference between cline ends, while in males the equivalent figure was 60%. Adaptive shifts in size but not in the other traits are therefore likely to have involved genes closely associated with In(3R)Payne. Because the size difference between karyotypes was similar in different populations, there was no evidence for coadaptation within populations.",2006,"L Rako, A R Anderson, C M SgrÃ², A J Stocker, A A Hoffmann, L Rako, A R Anderson, C M SgrÃ², A J Stocker, A A Hoffmann"
Expression and localization in spermatozoa of the mitochondrial porin isoform 2 in Drosophila melanogaster,16774740,10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.05.172,"Mitochondrial porins or VDACs (voltage-dependent anion-selective channels) are transmembrane pore-forming proteins.

In a previous report we have expressed in vitro Porin 2 (gene GC17137) and we have found that the reconstituted protein shows pore-forming activity but it is cation-selective and poorly dependent from voltage. In this work we have characterized the expression pattern of Porin 2. Amplification upon germinal and somatic or stage specific mRNA showed that the highest transcription level of Porin 2 is in testis. Western blot analysis performed with antibodies raised against the recombinant Porin 2 confirmed a high level of expression in the fly spermatozoa. Immuno-histochemical studies indicate that Porin 2 is selectively present in spermatozoa tail, where the mitochondria are located, but not in spermatocytes. A lethal mutant of D. melanogaster carrying a P-element in the first intron of the porin (Porin 1) gene hinders the expression of both Porin 1 and 2.

The dot chromosome of Drosophila: insights into chromatin states and their change over evolutionary time,16821136,10.1007/s10577-006-1061-6,"Historically, chromatin has been subdivided into heterochromatin, transcriptionally inactive regions that remain densely packaged throughout the cell cycle, and euchromatin, transcriptionally active regions that take on a diffuse appearance as the cell enters interphase. The banded portion of the small fourth chromosome (dot chromosome) of Drosophila melanogaster is unusual in exhibiting many characteristics of heterochromatic domains, and at the same time maintaining a gene density typical of euchromatin. Similar to genes embedded in pericentric heterochromatin, many of the dot chromosome genes have adapted to a heterochromatic environment. Little is known about the regulation of these genes and less about their evolution in a chromatin context. Interestingly, most of the genes from the D. melanogaster fourth chromosome remain clustered on a small chromosome throughout the genus Drosophila; yet the dot chromosome appears euchromatic in some species, such as D. virilis. Existing genomic sequence data allow an exploration of the underlying differences in DNA sequence organization between species. Here we review the available data describing the dot chromosome, which derives primarily from D. melanogaster. With its unusual and changing nature, the dot chromosome in the genus Drosophila provides a unique opportunity for the examination of transitions between chromatin states during evolution.",2006,"Nicole C Riddle, Sarah C R Elgin, Nicole C Riddle, Sarah C R Elgin"
Widespread adaptive evolution of Drosophila genes with sex-biased expression,16951084,10.1534/genetics.106.058008,"Many genes in higher eukaryotes show sexually dimorphic expression, and these genes tend to be among the most divergent between species. In most cases, however, it is not known whether this rapid divergence is caused by positive selection or if it is due to a relaxation of selective constraint. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we surveyed DNA sequence polymorphism in 91 Drosophila melanogaster genes with male-, female-, or nonsex-biased expression and determined their divergence from the sister species D. simulans. Using several single- and multilocus statistical tests, we estimated the type and strength of selection influencing the evolution of the proteins encoded by genes of each expression class. Adaptive evolution, as indicated by a relative excess of nonsynonymous divergence between species, was common among the sex-biased genes (both male and female). Male-biased genes, in particular, showed a strong and consistent signal of positive selection, while female-biased genes showed more variation in the type of selection they experience. Genes expressed equally in the two sexes, in contrast, showed no evidence for adaptive evolution between D. melanogaster and D. simulans.

Cyanide binding and heme cavity conformational transitions in Drosophila melanogaster hexacoordinate hemoglobin,16906763,10.1021/bi060462a,"The reason for the presence of hemoglobin-like molecules in insects, such as Drosophila melanogaster, that live in fully aerobic environments has yet to be determined. Heme endogenous hexacoordination (where HisE7 and HisF8 axial ligands to the heme Fe atom are both provided by the protein) is a recently discovered mechanism proposed to modulate O(2) affinity in hemoglobins from different species. Previous results have shown that D. melanogaster hemoglobin 1 (product of the glob1 gene) displays heme endogenous hexacoordination in both the ferrous and ferric states. Here we present kinetic data characterizing the exogenous cyanide ligand binding process, and the three-dimensional structure (at 1.4 A resolution) of the ensuing cyano-met D. melanogaster hemoglobin. Comparison with the crystal structure of the endogenously hexacoordinated D. melanogaster hemoglobin shows that the transition to the cyano-met form is supported by conformational readjustment in the CD-D-E region of the protein, which removes HisE7 from the heme. The structural and functional features of D. melanogaster hemoglobin are examined in light of previous results achieved for human and mouse neuroglobins and for human cytoglobin, which display heme endogenous hexacoordination. The study shows that, despite the rather constant value for cyanide association rate constants for the ferric hemoproteins, different distal site conformational readjustments and/or heme sliding mechanisms are displayed by the known hexacoordinate hemoglobins as a result of exogenous ligand binding.",2006,"Daniele de Sanctis, Paolo Ascenzi, Alessio Bocedi, Sylvia Dewilde, Thorsten Burmester, Thomas Hankeln, Luc Moens, Martino Bolognesi"

To gain insight into dAda2A function, we sought to identify novel components of the complex containing this protein, ATAC (Ada two A containing) complex. Affinity purification and mass spectrometry revealed that, in addition to dAda3 and dGcn5, host cell factor (dHCF) and a novel SANT domain protein, named Atac1 (ATAC component 1), copurify with this complex. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that these proteins associate with dGcn5 and dAda2A, but not with dSAGA-specific components such as dAda2B and dSpt3. Biochemical fractionation revealed that ATAC has an apparent molecular mass of 700 kDa and contains dAda2A, dGcn5, dAda3, dHCF, and Atac1 as stable subunits.

We generated mutations in the Ppt1 ortholog of Drosophila melanogaster to characterize phenotypes caused by Ppt1 deficiency in flies. Ppt1-deficient flies accumulate abnormal autofluorescent storage material predominantly in the adult CNS and have a life span 30% shorter than wild type, phenotypes that generally recapitulate disease-associated phenotypes common to all forms of NCL. In contrast, some phenotypes of Ppt1-deficient flies differed from those observed in human INCL. Storage material in flies appeared as highly laminar spherical deposits in cells of the brain and as curvilinear profiles in cells of the thoracic ganglion. This contrasts with the granular deposits characteristic of human INCL. In addition, the reduced life span of Ppt1-deficient flies is not caused by progressive death of CNS neurons. No changes in brain morphology or increases in apoptotic cell death of CNS neurons were detected in Ppt1-deficient flies, even at advanced ages.

      The family of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK) plays important roles in embryonic development and in cellular responses to stress. Toxic metals and their compounds are potent activators of JNK in mammalian cells. The mechanism of mammalian JNK activation by cadmium and sodium arsenite involves toxicant-induced oxidative stress. The study of mammalian signaling pathways to JNK is complicated by the significant degree of redundancy among upstream JNK regulators, especially at the level of JNK kinase kinases (JNKKK).

      Using Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells, we demonstrate here that cadmium and arsenite activate Drosophila JNK (D-JNK) via oxidative stress as well, thus providing a simpler model system to study JNK signaling. To elucidate the signaling pathways that lead to activation of D-JNK in response to cadmium or arsenite, we employed RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down thirteen upstream regulators of D-JNK, either singly or in combinations of up to seven at a time.

The results of these studies demonstrate that in insects that do not have bicoid, anterior patterning is regulated by a combination of maternal orthodenticle and hunchback. Furthermore, during the evolution of long-germ-band development, Nasonia and Drosophila may have evolved different mechanisms to pattern posterior segments, marginalising the important role of the terminal system in short-germ-band embryos.",2006,"Alistair P McGregor, Alistair P McGregor"
"Coordination of microtubule and microfilament dynamics by Drosophila Rho1, Spire and Cappuccino",16518391,10.1038/ncb1385,"The actin-nucleation factors Spire and Cappuccino (Capu) regulate the onset of ooplasmic streaming in Drosophila melanogaster. Although this streaming event is microtubule-based, actin assembly is required for its timing. It is not understood how the interaction of microtubules and microfilaments is mediated in this context. Here, we demonstrate that Capu and Spire have microtubule and microfilament crosslinking activity. The spire locus encodes several distinct protein isoforms (SpireA, SpireC and SpireD). SpireD was recently shown to nucleate actin, but the activity of the other isoforms has not been addressed. We find that SpireD does not have crosslinking activity, whereas SpireC is a potent crosslinker. We show that SpireD binds to Capu and inhibits F-actin/microtubule crosslinking, and activated Rho1 abolishes this inhibition, establishing a mechanistic basis for the regulation of Capu and Spire activity. We propose that Rho1, cappuccino and spire are elements of a conserved developmental cassette that is capable of directly mediating crosstalk between microtubules and microfilaments.",2006,"Alicia E Rosales-Nieves, James E Johndrow, Lani C Keller, Craig R Magie, Delia M Pinto-Santini, Susan M Parkhurst, Alicia E Rosales-Nieves, James E Johndrow, Lani C Keller, Craig R Magie, Delia M Pinto-Santini, Susan M Parkhurst"
"Environmental stress and reproduction in Drosophila melanogaster: starvation resistance, ovariole numbers and early age egg production",16848899,10.1186/1471-2148-6-57,"Background:
      
    

    
      The Y model of resource allocation predicts a tradeoff between reproduction and survival. Environmental stress could affect a tradeoff between reproduction and survival, but the physiological mechanisms underlying environmental mediation of the tradeoff are largely unknown. One example is the tradeoff between starvation resistance and early fecundity. One goal of the present study was to determine if reduced early age fecundity was indeed a robust indirect response to selection for starvation resistance, by investigation of a set of D. melanogaster starvation selected lines which had not previously been characterized for age specific egg production. Another goal of the present study was to investigate a possible relationship between ovariole number and starvation resistance. Ovariole number is correlated with maximum daily fecundity in outbred D. melanogaster. Thus, one might expect that a negative genetic correlation between starvation resistance and early fecundity would be accompanied by a decrease in ovariole number.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Selection for early age female starvation resistance favored survival under food deprivation conditions apparently at the expense of early age egg production. The total number of eggs produced by females from selected and control lines was approximately the same for the first 26 days of life, but the timing of egg production differed such that selected females produced fewer eggs early in adult life. Females from lines selected for female starvation resistance exhibited a greater number of ovarioles than did unselected lines. Moreover, maternal starvation resulted in progeny with a greater number of ovarioles in both selected and unselected lines.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Reduced early age egg production is a robust response to laboratory selection for starvation survival. Ovariole numbers increased in response to selection for female starvation resistance indicating that ovariole number does not account for reduced early age egg production. Further, ovariole number increased in a parallel response to maternal starvation, suggesting an evolutionary association between maternal environment and the reproductive system of female progeny.",2006,"Marta L Wayne, Usha Soundararajan, Lawrence G Harshman, Marta L Wayne, Usha Soundararajan, Lawrence G Harshman"
"The Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate kinase1 gene affects olfactory reception in Drosophila melanogaster",16463070,10.1007/s10519-005-9031-x,"The Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) route is one of the two main transduction cascades that mediate olfactory reception in Drosophila melanogaster. The activity of IP3 kinase1 reduces the levels of this substrate by phosphorylation into inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakiphosphate (IP4). We show here that the gene is expressed in olfactory sensory organs as well as in the rest of the head. To evaluate in vivo the olfactory functional effects of up-regulating IP3K1, individuals with directed genetic changes at the reception level only were generated using the UAS/Gal4 method. In this report, we described the consequences in olfactory perception of overexpressing the IP3Kinase1 gene at eight different olfactory receptor-neuron subsets. Six out of the eight studied Gal-4/UAS-IP3K1 hybrids displayed abnormal behavioral responses to ethyl acetate, acetone, ethanol or propionaldehyde. Specific behavioral defects corresponded to the particular neuronal olfactory profile. These data confirm the role of the IP3kinase1 gene, and consequently the IP3 transduction cascade, in mediating olfactory information at the reception level.",2006,"Carolina Gomez-Diaz, Fernando Martin, Esther Alcorta, Carolina Gomez-Diaz, Fernando Martin, Esther Alcorta"

Comparative sequence analysis and tissue localization of members of the SLC6 family of transporters in adult Drosophila melanogaster,16916974,10.1242/jeb.02328,"The SLC6 family comprises proteins that move extracellular neurotransmitters, amino acids and osmolytes across the plasma membrane into the cytosol. In mammals, deletion of SLC6 family members has dramatic physiologic consequences, but in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, little is known about this family of proteins. Therefore, in this study we carried out an initial analysis of 21 known or putative SLC6 family members from the Drosophila genome. Protein sequences from these genes segregated into either well-defined subfamilies, including the novel insect amino acid transporter subfamily, or into a group of weakly related sequences not affiliated with a recognized subfamily. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis and in situ hybridization showed that seven of these genes are expressed in the CNS. In situ hybridization revealed that two previously cloned SLC6 members, the serotonin and dopamine transporters, were localized to presumptive presynaptic neurons that previously immunolabelled for these transmitters. RNA for CG1732 (the putative GABA transporter) and CG15088 (a member of the novel insect amino acid transporter family) was localized in cells likely to be subtypes of glia, while RNA for CG5226, CG10804 (both members of the orphan neurotransmitter transporter subfamily) and CG5549 (a putative glycine transporter) were expressed broadly throughout the cellular cortex of the CNS. Eight of the 21 sequences were localized outside the CNS in the alimentary canal, Malpighian tubules and reproductive organs. Localization for six sequences was not found or not attempted in the adult fly. We used the Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian vesicular monoamine transporter 2, CG33528, to independently identify monoaminergic neurons in the adult fly. RNA for CG33528 was detected in a limited number of cells in the central brain and in a beaded stripe at the base of the photoreceptors in the position of glia, but not in the photoreceptors themselves. The SLC6 localization observations in conjunction with likely substrates based on phylogenetic inferences are a first step in defining the role of Na/Cl-dependent transporters in Drosophila physiology.",2006,"Matthew S Thimgan, Jonathan S Berg, Ann E Stuart, Matthew S Thimgan, Jonathan S Berg, Ann E Stuart"
Molecular evolution in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup: frequent parameter fluctuations on the timescale of molecular divergence,16387879,10.1534/genetics.105.049676,"Although mutation, genetic drift, and natural selection are well established as determinants of genome evolution, the importance (frequency and magnitude) of parameter fluctuations in molecular evolution is less understood. DNA sequence comparisons among closely related species allow specific substitutions to be assigned to lineages on a phylogenetic tree. In this study, we compare patterns of codon usage and protein evolution in 22 genes (>11,000 codons) among Drosophila melanogaster and five relatives within the D. melanogaster subgroup. We assign changes to eight lineages using a maximum-likelihood approach to infer ancestral states. Uncertainty in ancestral reconstructions is taken into account, at least to some extent, by weighting reconstructions by their posterior probabilities. Four of the eight lineages show potentially genomewide departures from equilibrium synonymous codon usage; three are decreasing and one is increasing in major codon usage. Several of these departures are consistent with lineage-specific changes in selection intensity (selection coefficients scaled to effective population size) at silent sites. Intron base composition and rates and patterns of protein evolution are also heterogeneous among these lineages. The magnitude of forces governing silent, intron, and protein evolution appears to have varied frequently, and in a lineage-specific manner, within the D. melanogaster subgroup.",2006,"Hiroshi Akashi, Wen-Ya Ko, Shengfu Piao, Anoop John, Piyush Goel, Chiao-Feng Lin, Alexa P Vitins"
Seasonal fluctuation in susceptibility to insecticides within natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. II. Features of genetic variation in susceptibility to organophosphate insecticides within natural populations of D. melanogaster,17038799,10.1266/ggs.81.273,"To elucidate genetic variation in susceptibility to organophosphate insecticides within natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster, we conducted an analysis of variance for mortality data sets of isofemale lines (10-286 lines) used in the previous studies. Susceptibility of isofemale lines to the three organophosphate insecticides was continuously distributed within each natural population, ranging from susceptible to resistant. Analysis of variance showed highly significant variation among isofemale lines in susceptibility to each insecticide for each natural population. Significant genetic variances in susceptibility to the three chemicals were estimated for the Katsunuma population; 0.0529-0.2722 for malathion, 0.0492-0.1603 for prothiophos, and 0.0469-0.1696 for fenitrothion. Contrary to the consistent seasonal tendency towards an increase in mean susceptibility in the fall, reported in the previous study, genetic variances in susceptibility to the three organophosphates did not change significantly in 1997 but tended to increase by 2- to 5-times in 1998. We tested whether both the observed situations, maintenance and increase in genetic variance in organophosphate resistance, can be generated under circumstances in which the levels of resistance to the three organophosphates tended to decrease, by conducting a simulation analysis, based on the hypothesis that resistant genotypes have lower fitnesses than susceptible ones under the density-independent condition. The simulation analysis generally explained the pattern in the mean susceptibility and genetic variances in susceptibility to the three organophosphates, observed in the Katsunuma population of D. melanogaster. It was suggested that the differences in the frequencies of resistance genes in the summer population could affect the patterns in genetic variance in organophosphate resistance in the fall population.",2006,"Takahiro Miyo, Yuzuru Oguma, Brian Charlesworth, Takahiro Miyo, Yuzuru Oguma, Brian Charlesworth"
Deletions encompassing the manganese superoxide dismutase gene in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,16936783,10.1139/g06-029,"Two deletions, Df(2R)Sod2-11 and Df(2R)Sod2-332, are recovered that encompass the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) gene or a null mutant referred to as SOD2n283 in Drosophila. Molecular analysis has revealed that the Df(2R)Sod2-332 deletion completely uncovered both MnSOD and its adjacent gene, Arp53D, whereas Df(2R)Sod2-11 was missing the promoter region of MnSOD gene. As a consequence of reduced MnSOD expression, these deletion heterozygotes are now sensitive to oxidative stress. Complementation analysis with some recently recovered deletions in the 53C/D region has established that other essential loci exist in this interval, and second, that Arp53D function is not essential for the survival of the organism. These deletions will be instrumental in the recovery of missense substitutions in the MnSOD peptide and their influence on oxidative stress resistance.",2006,"Amy Belton, Anirban Paul, Atanu Duttaroy, Amy Belton, Anirban Paul, Atanu Duttaroy"
A review of neurohormone GPCRs present in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster and the honey bee Apis mellifera,17070981,10.1016/j.pneurobio.2006.07.005,"G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) genes are large gene families in every animal, sometimes making up to 1-2% of the animal's genome. Of all insect GPCRs, the neurohormone (neuropeptide, protein hormone, biogenic amine) GPCRs are especially important, because they, together with their ligands, occupy a high hierarchic position in the physiology of insects and steer crucial processes such as development, reproduction, and behavior. In this paper, we give a review of our current knowledge on Drosophila melanogaster GPCRs and use this information to annotate the neurohormone GPCR genes present in the recently sequenced genome from the honey bee Apis mellifera. We found 35 neuropeptide receptor genes in the honey bee (44 in Drosophila) and two genes, coding for leucine-rich repeats-containing protein hormone GPCRs (4 in Drosophila). In addition, the honey bee has 19 biogenic amine receptor genes (21 in Drosophila). The larger numbers of neurohormone receptors in Drosophila are probably due to gene duplications that occurred during recent evolution of the fly. Our analyses also yielded the likely ligands for 40 of the 56 honey bee neurohormone GPCRs identified in this study. In addition, we made some interesting observations on neurohormone GPCR evolution and the evolution and co-evolution of their ligands. For neuropeptide and protein hormone GPCRs, there appears to be a general co-evolution between receptors and their ligands. This is in contrast to biogenic amine GPCRs, where evolutionarily unrelated GPCRs often bind to the same biogenic amine, suggesting frequent ligand exchanges (""ligand hops"") during GPCR evolution.",2006,"Frank Hauser, Giuseppe Cazzamali, Michael Williamson, Wolfgang Blenau, Cornelis J P Grimmelikhuijzen, Frank Hauser, Giuseppe Cazzamali, Michael Williamson, Wolfgang Blenau, Cornelis J P Grimmelikhuijzen"
Emergence of sperm from female storage sites has egg-influenced and egg-independent phases in Drosophila melanogaster,17148345,10.1098/rsbl.2005.0386,"The coordinated introduction of sperm and eggs is a prerequisite of high fertilization efficiency. In Drosophila melanogaster, as in most internally fertilizing animals, mated females store sperm prior to fertilization. Yet the regulation of sperm exit from these storage sites is poorly understood. To test one likely factor that could coordinate gamete availability, we quantified sperm exit from storage in three types of female: genetically matched females that were normal or eggless, and an additional wild-type control. Long-term depletion of sperm stores in normal females and eggless females occurs at similar rates. However, soon after mating, egg presence appears to accelerate the transition from one storage stage to the next. Since male ejaculate components and female factors contribute to sperm depletion, opportunities exist for both cooperation and conflict between the sexes in sperm storage dynamics.",2006,"Margaret C Bloch Qazi, Mariana F Wolfner, Margaret C Bloch Qazi, Mariana F Wolfner"

Nevertheless, only a few in vitro approaches are available in Drosophila to complement genetic studies in order to better elucidate developmental mechanisms at the cellular and molecular level. Here we present a dissociated cell culture system generated from the optic lobes of Drosophila larval brain. This culture system makes it feasible to study the proliferative properties of Drosophila postembryonic Nbs by allowing BrdU pulse and chase assays, as well as detailed immunocytochemical analysis with molecular markers. These immunofluorescence experiments allowed us to conclude that localization of asymmetric cell division markers such as Inscuteable, Miranda, Prospero and Numb is cell autonomous. By time-lapse video recording we have observed interesting cellular features of postembryonic neurogenesis such us the polarized genesis of the neuroblast progeny, the extremely short ganglion mother cell (GMC) cell cycle, and the last division of a neuroblast lineage.

A single basis for developmental buffering of Drosophila wing shape,17183701,10.1371/journal.pone.0000007,"The nature of developmental buffering processes has been debated extensively, based on both theoretical reasoning and empirical studies. In particular, controversy has focused on the question of whether distinct processes are responsible for canalization, the buffering against environmental or genetic variation, and for developmental stability, the buffering against random variation intrinsic in developmental processes. Here, we address this question for the size and shape of Drosophila melanogaster wings in an experimental design with extensively replicated and fully controlled genotypes. The amounts of variation among individuals and of fluctuating asymmetry differ markedly among genotypes, demonstrating a clear genetic basis for size and shape variability. For wing shape, there is a high correlation between the amounts of variation among individuals and fluctuating asymmetry, which indicates a correspondence between the two types of buffering. Likewise, the multivariate patterns of shape variation among individuals and of fluctuating asymmetry show a close association. For wing size, however, the amounts of individual variation and fluctuating asymmetry are not correlated. There was a significant link between the amounts of variation between wing size and shape, more so for fluctuating asymmetry than for variation among individuals. Overall, these experiments indicate a considerable degree of shared control of individual variation and fluctuating asymmetry, although it appears to differ between traits.",2006,"Casper J Breuker, James S Patterson, Christian Peter Klingenberg, Casper J Breuker, James S Patterson, Christian Peter Klingenberg"

Variation of gene frequencies of Adh and alpha Gpdh-1 can be considered random when samples collected each month are taken into account. When mean monthly frequencies are considered, alpha Gpdh-1 does not show any significant variation all over the year; yet, variation of the frequency of AdhS shows a cyclical pattern, its frequency being maximum at the end of the summer and minimum after overwintering.

Using an in vitro polymerisation assay we found no significant effects on the ability of the mutant actins to polymerise. E364K and G366D also caused a strong induction of heat shock protein (hsp) synthesis at normal temperatures and accumulated large amounts of hsp22 which, together with the mutant actin, was resistant to detergent extraction. Both E316K and E334K caused a weak induction of hsp synthesis.

In tissues such as fat body, gastric caeca, and adult cardiac valve, the patterns of expression for ADH protein and mRNA were identical. Other tissues such as oocytes, nurse cells, imaginal disks, and brain show levels of Adh mRNA that are lower than or equivalent to those observed in the previously mentioned tissues, but they exhibit little or no ADH protein. The lack of concordance between Adh mRNA and ADH protein expression in oocytes and nurse cells may reflect the packaging of maternal mRNAs (but not ADH protein) for use in early development.

Comparison of several promoters and polyadenylation signals for use in heterologous gene expression in cultured Drosophila cells,1656386,10.1093/nar/19.18.5037,"We have directly compared the ability of four promoters and three polyadenylation (poly(A)) signals to direct heterologous gene expression in stably transfected Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. We compared two constitutive Drosophila promoters, the actin 5C distal promoter and the alpha 1-tubulin promoter, with the tightly regulated Drosophila metallothionein (Mtn) promoter and the Bombyx mori fibroin promoter. We find that the actin 5C and induced Mtn promoters generate comparable high levels of RNA and protein in this system. The alpha 1-tubulin promoter generates about four-fold lower levels, and the fibroin promoter shows no detectable activity in S2 cells. Interestingly, genes expressed from the constitutive actin 5C and alpha 1-tubulin promoters are consistently present at three- to four-fold lower copy numbers than genes expressed from the inducible Mtn promoter or the inactive fibroin promoter. Poly(A) signals of both mammalian (SV40) and Drosophila (Mtn) origin efficiently directed stable RNA synthesis in S2 cells, and, as in mammalian cells, the SV40 late poly(A) signal was more efficient than the SV40 early poly(A) signal.

Effects of lamellolysin from a parasitoid wasp on Drosophila blood cells in vitro,1899269,10.1002/jez.1402570214,"Female parasitoid Leptopilina heterotoma inject a factor, lamellolysin, along with their eggs into the host hemocoel to destroy selectively host hemocytes that encapsulate foreign objects.

To study the effects of lamellolysin on Drosophila lamellocytes in vitro, a giant strain of D. melanogaster was constructed to yield hemolymph with an abundance of lamellocytes. The effect of lamellolysin on the adhesivity of lamellocytes in vitro was demonstrated when the cells were gently rotated in the culture medium. Under these conditions, the bipolar shape of the affected lamellocytes resembled that of lamellocytes in parasitized hosts. When lamellocytes were exposed to lamellolysin in stationary culture medium, the elongation of the bipolar cells continued until they became threadlike. Lamellocytes fragmented in both stationary and rotating culture medium in the presence of lamellolysin, although loss of cellular material was more pronounced in the latter.

The latter was 23 times more active as a JH mimic in the white puparial assay (ED50 = 0.22 pmole). Larval development and pupariation were unaffected except at 1000 ppm methoprene and 10 ppm or higher S31183 where larval life was prolonged with increased mortality in the second instar.

The methoprene-resistant mutations, Met1 and Met2, were 10 and 6 times more resistant to S31183 in the white puparial assay and about 20 times more resistant in the larval feeding experiments than the wild-type, indicating that the effects seen are typical of JH. These studies suggest that excess JH may affect adult development of imaginal structures if present at the onset of postembryonic cell proliferation of the imaginal discs or histoblasts. Thus, commitment for adult differentiation must occur early during this proliferative phase.",1991,"L M Riddiford, M Ashburner, L M Riddiford, M Ashburner"
Muscle abnormalities in Drosophila melanogaster heldup mutants are caused by missing or aberrant troponin-I isoforms,1908472,10.1083/jcb.114.5.941,"We have investigated the molecular bases of muscle abnormalities in four Drosophila melanogaster heldup mutants. We find that the heldup gene encodes troponin-I, one of the principal regulatory proteins associated with skeletal muscle thin filaments. heldup3, heldup4, and heldup5 mutants, all of which have grossly abnormal flight muscle myofibrils, lack mRNAs encoding one or more troponin-I isoforms. In contrast, heldup2, an especially interesting mutant wherein flight muscles are atrophic, synthesizes the complete mRNA complement. By sequencing mutant troponin-I cDNAs we demonstrate that the molecular basis for muscle degeneration in heldup2 is conversion of an invariant alanine residue to valine. We finally show that degeneration of heldup2 thin filament/Z-disc networks can be prevented by eliminating thick filaments from flight muscles using a null allele of the sarcomeric myosin heavy chain gene. This latter observation suggests that actomyosin interactions exacerbate the structural or functional defect resulting from the troponin-I mutation.",1991,"C J Beall, E Fyrberg, C J Beall, E Fyrberg"
"The isolation and characterization of mutant alleles at a new X-linked locus, mex, affecting NADP(+)-dependent enzymes in Drosophila melanogaster",1907131,,"The isolation and characterization of mutant alleles in a regulatory gene affecting NADP(+)-dependent enzymes are described. The locus, mex, is at position 26.5 +/- 0.74 on the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster. The newly isolated mutant allele, mex1, is recessive to either the mex allele found in Oregon-R wild-type individuals or that found in the cm v parental stock in which the new mutants were induced. The mex1 mutant allele is associated with statistically significant decreases in malic enzyme (ME) specific activity and ME specific immunologically cross-reacting material (ME-CRM) in newly emerged adult males. During this same developmental stage in males, the NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase specific activity increases to statistically significant levels. Females of the mex1 mutant strain show statistically significant elevated levels of the pentose phosphate shunt enzymes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Isoelectric focusing and thermolability comparisons of the active ME from mutant and control organisms indicate that the enzyme is the same. Developmental profiles of mex1 and control strains indicate that this mutant allele differentially modulates the levels of ME enzymatic activity and ME-CRM during development.",1991,"A R Gromnicki, M M Bentley, A R Gromnicki, M M Bentley"
Cytogenetic analysis of the second chromosome heterochromatin of Drosophila melanogaster,1707844,,"This paper reports the cytogenetic characterization of the second chromosome heterochromatin of Drosophila melanogaster. High resolution cytological analysis of a sample of translocations, inversions, deficiencies and free duplications involving the pericentric regions of the second chromosome was achieved by applying sequential Hoechst 33258 and N-chromosome banding techniques to larval neuroblast prometaphase chromosomes. Heterochromatic rearrangements were employed in a series of complementation assays and the genetic elements previously reported to be within or near the second chromosome heterochromatin were thus precisely assigned to specific heterochromatic bands. The results of this analysis reveal a nonhomogeneous distribution of loci along the second chromosome heterochromatin. The l(2)41Aa, l(2)41Ab, rolled (l(2)41Ac) and l(2)41Ad loci are located within the proximal heterochromatin of 2R, while the nine remaining loci in the left arm and two (l(2)41Ae and l(2)41Ah) in the right arm map to h35 and to h46, respectively, the most distal heterochromatic regions. In addition, a common feature of these loci revealed by the cytogenetic analysis is that they map to specific heterochromatic blocks but do not correspond to the blocks themselves, suggesting that they are not as large as the Y fertility factors or the Rsp locus. Mutations of the proximal most heterochromatic loci, l(2)41Aa and rolled, were also examined for their phenotypic effects. Extensive cell death during imaginal disc development was observed in individuals hemizygous for either the EMS 31 and rolled mutations, leading to a pattern of phenotypic defects of adult structures.",1991,"P Dimitri, P Dimitri"
Developmental distribution of female-specific Sex-lethal proteins in Drosophila melanogaster,1900493,10.1101/gad.5.3.403,"The binary switch gene Sex-lethal (Sxl) must be on in females and off in males to allow the proper elaboration of the appropriate sexual developmental pathway in Drosophila melanogaster. Previous studies suggested a mechanism in which the on/off regulation of Sxl occurs post-transcriptionally at the level of RNA splicing. A critical prediction of this model is that functional Sxl proteins are absent in males but present in females. In this report we show that the expected full-length proteins are only present in female animals. Multiple forms of Sxl protein are found in females, some of which are expressed in a stage- and tissue-specific pattern. Consistent with a role of Sxl proteins in regulating alternate splicing, the proteins are localized in the nucleus where they exhibit a punctate staining pattern. Surprisingly, several minor Sxl proteins appear to be present in specific tissues of both sexes of adults. The possible origin of these species is discussed. We also show that Sxl expression in the early embryo is sex specific and depends on maternal daughterless and zygotic sisterless-b activity in accordance with the established roles of these genes as positive regulators of Sxl. The onset of Sxl expression in the germ line occurs later than that in the soma.",1991,"D Bopp, L R Bell, T W Cline, P Schedl, D Bopp, L R Bell, T W Cline, P Schedl"
Retrotransposon-induced overexpression of a homeobox gene causes defects in eye morphogenesis in Drosophila,1671353,,"Insertion of the tom transposable element into various Drosophila ananassae genes results in dominant phenotypes that affect eye morphology. One of these genes encoded by the Om(1D) locus was isolated by transposon tagging. The Om(1D) gene encodes a 2.7 kb transcript that is expressed in every stage of development. The deduced Om(1D) protein is 606 amino acids long and contains two glutamine/histidine, two alanine-rich and one histidine/proline repeats, as well as a homeodomain located near the carboxy terminus. Tom-induced alleles of Om(1D) show a 1.7-fold increased accumulation of Om(1D) RNA in whole individuals during late larval--early pupal stages of development, whereas expression of this transcript is 7-fold higher in the eye--antenna imaginal disc of mutant versus wild-type flies. D. melanogaster flies transformed with the Om(1D) coding region under the control of the hsp70 promoter display an eye phenotype similar to that of Om(1D) when expression of the homeobox protein encoded by the chimeric gene is induced by temperature elevation at the end of the third instar period. These results suggest that the eye-specific mutant phenotype caused by the insertion of the tom retrotransposon in the Om(1D) locus may be a consequence of the tissue-specific induction of the expression of this gene by sequences present in the transposable element.",1991,"S Tanda, V G Corces, S Tanda, V G Corces"
The rosy locus in Drosophila melanogaster: xanthine dehydrogenase and eye pigments,1783294,,"The rosy gene in Drosophila melanogaster codes for the enzyme xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH). Mutants that have no enzyme activity are characterized by a brownish eye color phenotype reflecting a deficiency in the red eye pigment. Xanthine dehydrogenase is not synthesized in the eye, but rather is transported there. The present report describes the ultrastructural localization of XDH in the Drosophila eye. Three lines of evidence are presented demonstrating that XDH is sequestered within specific vacuoles, the type II pigment granules. Histochemical and antibody staining of frozen sections, as well as thin layer chromatography studies of several adult genotypes serve to examine some of the factors and genic interactions that may be involved in transport of XDH, and in eye pigment formation. While a specific function for XDH in the synthesis of the red, pteridine eye pigments remains unknown, these studies present evidence that: (1) the incorporation of XDH into the pigment granules requires specific interaction between a normal XDH molecule and one or more transport proteins; (2) the structural integrity of the pigment granule itself is dependent upon the presence of a normal balance of eye pigments, a notion advanced earlier.",1991,"A G Reaume, D A Knecht, A Chovnick, A G Reaume, D A Knecht, A Chovnick"
"A truncated P element is inserted in the transcribed region of the Cu,Zn SOD gene of an SOD ""null"" strain of Drosophila melanogaster",1649100,10.3109/10715769109145813,"The decreased Cu,Zn SOD activity (less than 5%) in a ""null"" SODCA1 Drosophila melanogaster strain isolated in our laboratory is due to the insertion of a truncated P element into the transcribed region of the Cu,Zn SOD gene. Using a cDNA Cu,Zn SOD probe from a wild type D. melanogaster (F allele) we isolated an EcoRI Cu,Zn SOD clone from an EMBL3 genomic library of the SODCA1 strain, subcloned it, restriction-mapped and partially sequenced it. The 2.5 kb clone consists of a wild-type 1.84 kb EcoRI fragment containing the Cu,Zn SOD gene previously isolated in our laboratory, with an insertion of 0.68 kb derived (by an internal deletion) from an autonomous, 2.9 kb P element. The insertion starts 21 bp upstream from the coding sequence and causes an 8 bp target site duplication characteristic of P elements. A point mutation in the second exon results in a replacement of Asn by Lys at position 96, confirming that the mature protein encoded by the SOCCA1 is the same one encoded by the S allele, commonly found in natural populations. The diminished expression of SODCA1 allele is most possibly due to a reduction of the rate of transcription attributable to the insertion of the P element.",1991,"J Kwiatowski, D Skarecky, R Tyler, M Pascual, F J Ayala, J Kwiatowski, D Skarecky, R Tyler, M Pascual, F J Ayala"
P element excision in Drosophila melanogaster and related drosophilids,1850084,10.1007/BF00261678,"The frequency of P element excision and the structure of the resulting excision products were determined in three drosophilid species. Drosophila melanogaster, D. virilis, and Chymomyza procnemis. A transient P element mobility assay was conducted in the cells of developing insect embryos, but unlike previous assays, this mobility assay permitted the recovery of excision products from plasmids regardless of whether the excision event was precise or imprecise. Both quantitative and qualitative differences between the products of excision in the various species studied were observed. The frequency with which P element excision products were recovered from D. melanogaster was 10-fold greater than from D. virilis and C. procnemis; however, the proportion of all excision events resulting in the reversion of a P-induced mutant phenotype was the same. Virtually all excision products recovered, including those resulting in a reversion of the mutant phenotype, did not result in the exact restoration of the original target sequence. Sequence analysis suggested that duplex cleavage at the 3' and 5' termini of the P element, or their subsequent modification, occurred asymmetrically and interdependently.

Inferring the evolutionary histories of the Adh and Adh-dup loci in Drosophila melanogaster from patterns of polymorphism and divergence,1673107,,"The DNA sequences of 11 Drosophila melanogaster lines are compared across three contiguous regions, the Adh and Adh-dup loci and a noncoding 5' flanking region of Adh. Ninety-eight of approximately 4750 sites are segregating in the sample, 36 in the 5' flanking region, 38 in Adh and 24 in Adh-dup. Several methods are presented to test whether the patterns and levels of polymorphism are consistent with neutral molecular evolution. The analysis of within- and between-species polymorphism indicates that the region is evolving in a nonneutral and complex fashion. A graphical analysis of the data provides support for a hypothesized balanced polymorphism at or near position 1490, site of the amino acid replacement difference between Adhf and Adhs. The Adh-dup locus is less polymorphic than Adh and all 24 of its polymorphisms occur at low frequency--suggestive of a recent selective substitution in the Adh-dup region. Adhs alleles form two distinct evolutionary lineages that differ one from another at a total of nineteen sites in the Adh and Adh-dup loci. The polymorphisms are in complete linkage disequilibrium. A recombination experiment failed to find evidence for recombination suppression between the two allelic classes. Two hypotheses are presented to account for the widespread distribution of the two divergent lineages in natural populations.

Analysis of the promoter region of the housekeeping gene DmRP140 by sequence comparison of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis,1905256,10.1016/0378-1119(91)90361-e,"To analyze the transcriptional control regions of Drosophila melanogaster household genes, we have characterized the promoter of the gene coding for the second-largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (DmRP140). Analysis of cDNA revealed that the coding region of the protein extends beyond the originally assumed transcription start point (tsp) and deduced translation start codon [Falkenburg et al., J. Mol. Biol. 195 (1987) 929-937] and that the tsp determined previously corresponds to an intron/exon boundary of an additional intron.

It was shown that the frequency of deletions in the region studied is tenfold higher within the inverted chromosomes as compared with the structurally normal one. Anyway, it is essentially lower than the frequency determined in analogous experiments for the other region of the chromosome.

Recent work within our laboratory has demonstrated that cloning and expression of exon 1 of the Drosophila melanogaster CG15920 gene, encoding a putative resilin-like protein, results in a recombinant protein that can be photochemically crosslinked to form a highly resilient, elastic biomaterial (Rec1 resilin). The current study describes a recursive cloning strategy for generating synthetic genes encoding multiple copies of consensus polypeptides, based on the repetitive domains within resilin-like genes from D. melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae. A simple non-chromatographic purification method that can be applied to these synthetic proteins and Rec1 is also reported.

The age and evolution of an antiviral resistance mutation in Drosophila melanogaster,17550883,10.1098/rspb.2007.0611,"What selective processes underlie the evolution of parasites and their hosts? Arms-race models propose that new host-resistance mutations or parasite counter-adaptations arise and sweep to fixation. Frequency-dependent models propose that selection favours pathogens adapted to the most common host genotypes, conferring an advantage to rare host genotypes. Distinguishing between these models is empirically difficult. The maintenance of disease-resistance polymorphisms has been studied in detail in plants, but less so in animals, and rarely in natural populations. We have made a detailed study of genetic variation in host resistance in a natural animal population, Drosophila melanogaster, and its natural pathogen, the sigma virus. We confirm previous findings that a single (albeit complex) mutation in the gene ref(2)P confers resistance against sigma and show that this mutation has increased in frequency under positive selection. Previous studies suggested that ref(2)P polymorphism reflects the progress of a very recent selective sweep, and that in Europe during the 1980s, this was followed by a sweep of a sigma virus strain able to infect flies carrying this mutation. We find that the ref(2)P resistance mutation is considerably older than the recent spread of this viral strain and suggest that--possibly because it is recessive--the initial spread of the resistance mutation was very slow.",2007,"Jenny Bangham, Darren J Obbard, Kang-Wook Kim, Penelope R Haddrill, Francis M Jiggins, Jenny Bangham, Darren J Obbard, Kang-Wook Kim, Penelope R Haddrill, Francis M Jiggins"
Species-specific positive selection of the male-specific lethal complex that participates in dosage compensation in Drosophila,17878295,10.1073/pnas.0707445104,"In many taxa, males and females have unequal ratios of sex chromosomes to autosomes, which has resulted in the invention of diverse mechanisms to equilibrate gene expression between the sexes (dosage compensation). Failure to compensate for sex chromosome dosage results in male lethality in Drosophila. In Drosophila, a male-specific lethal (MSL) complex of proteins and noncoding RNAs binds to hundreds of sites on the single male X chromosome and up-regulates gene expression. Here we use population genetics of two closely related Drosophila species to show that adaptive evolution has occurred in all five protein-coding genes of the MSL complex. This positive selection is asymmetric between closely related species, with a very strong signature apparent in Drosophila melanogaster but not in Drosophila simulans. In particular, the MSL1 and MSL2 proteins have undergone dramatic positive selection in D. melanogaster, in domains previously shown to be responsible for their specific targeting to the X chromosome. This signature of positive selection at an essential protein-DNA interface of the complex is unexpected and suggests that X chromosomal MSL-binding DNA segments may themselves be changing rapidly. This highly asymmetric, rapid evolution of the MSL genes further suggests that misregulated dosage compensation may represent one of the underlying causes of male hybrid inviability in Drosophila, wherein the fate of hybrid males depends on which species' X chromosome is inherited.",2007,"Monica A Rodriguez, Danielle Vermaak, Joshua J Bayes, Harmit S Malik, Monica A Rodriguez, Danielle Vermaak, Joshua J Bayes, Harmit S Malik"

Quantitative genomics of locomotor behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,17708775,10.1186/gb-2007-8-8-r172,"Background:
      
    

    
      Locomotion is an integral component of most animal behaviors, and many human health problems are associated with locomotor deficits. Locomotor behavior is a complex trait, with population variation attributable to many interacting loci with small effects that are sensitive to environmental conditions. However, the genetic basis of this complex behavior is largely uncharacterized.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We quantified locomotor behavior of Drosophila melanogaster in a large population of inbred lines derived from a single natural population, and derived replicated selection lines with different levels of locomotion. Estimates of broad-sense and narrow-sense heritabilities were 0.52 and 0.16, respectively, indicating substantial non-additive genetic variance for locomotor behavior. We used whole genome expression analysis to identify 1,790 probe sets with different expression levels between the selection lines when pooled across replicates, at a false discovery rate of 0.001. The transcriptional responses to selection for locomotor, aggressive and mating behavior from the same base population were highly overlapping, but the magnitude of the expression differences between selection lines for increased and decreased levels of behavior was uncorrelated. We assessed the locomotor behavior of ten mutations in candidate genes with altered transcript abundance between selection lines, and identified seven novel genes affecting this trait.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:

Patterns of mutation and selection at synonymous sites in Drosophila,18000010,10.1093/molbev/msm196,"That natural selection affects molecular evolution at synonymous sites in protein-coding sequences is well established and is thought to predominantly reflect selection for translational efficiency/accuracy mediated through codon bias. However, a recently developed maximum likelihood framework, when applied to 18 coding sequences in 3 species of Drosophila, confirmed an earlier report that the Notch gene in Drosophila melanogaster was evolving under selection in favor of those codons defined as unpreferred in this species. This finding opened the possibility that synonymous sites may be subject to a variety of selective pressures beyond weak selection for increased frequencies of the codons currently defined as ""preferred"" in D. melanogaster. To further explore patterns of synonymous site evolution in Drosophila in a lineage-specific manner, we expanded the application of the maximum likelihood framework to 8,452 protein coding sequences with well-defined orthology in D. melanogaster, Drosophila sechellia, and Drosophila yakuba. Our analyses reveal intragenomic and interspecific variation in mutational patterns as well as in patterns and intensity of selection on synonymous sites. In D. melanogaster, our results provide little statistical evidence for recent selection on synonymous sites, and Notch remains an outlier. In contrast, in D. sechellia our findings provide evidence in support of selection predominantly in favor of preferred codons. However, there is a small subset of genes in this species that appear to be evolving under selection in favor of unpreferred codons, which indicates that selection on synonymous sites is not limited to the preferential fixation of mutations that enhance the speed or accuracy of translation in this species.",2007,"Nadia D Singh, Vanessa L Bauer DuMont, Melissa J Hubisz, Rasmus Nielsen, Charles F Aquadro"
"Male accessory glands of Drosophila melanogaster make a secreted angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ANCE), suggesting a role for the peptide-processing enzyme in seminal fluid",17921161,10.1242/jeb.009035,"Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) expressed on the surface of endothelial cells is responsible for the last step in the synthesis of circulating angiotensin II and the inactivation of bradykinin.

The importance of an ACE gene to male fertility has also been demonstrated in Drosophila melanogaster, where Ance is expressed in spermatids, and hypomorphic alleles of Ance cause a defect in spermiogenesis. Here we show that ANCE, which shares many enzymatic properties with mammalian ACE, is also a product of the male accessory gland of D. melanogaster. It is expressed in the secondary cells and is associated with the electron dense granule within the large vesicles of these cells. ACE proteolytic activity is lost from the accessory glands during mating, consistent with transfer to the mated female in the seminal fluid.

We performed comparative measurements of several parameters in young (a few days) and old (8 and 12 weeks) adult male Drosophila melanogaster: respiratory complex activities, mitochondrial respiration, ATP synthesis, lipid composition of the inner membrane, concentrations of respiratory complex subunits, expression of genes (nuclear and mitochondrial) coding for mitochondrial proteins. Our results show that, in the mitochondria of ""old"" flies, the activities of three respiratory complexes (I, III, IV) are greatly diminished, ATP synthesis is decreased, and the lipid composition of the inner membrane (fatty acids, cardiolipin) is modified. However, the respiration rate and subunit concentrations measured by Western blot are unaffected. Although cellular mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content remains constant, there is a decrease in concentrations of nuclear and mitochondrial transcripts apparently coordinated. The expression of nuclear genes encoding the transcription factors TFAM, TFB1, TFB2, and DmTTF, which are essential for the maintenance and expression of mtDNA are also decreased. The decrease in nuclear and mitochondrial transcript concentrations may be one of the principal effects of aging on mitochondria, and could explain observed decreases in mitochondrial efficiency.",2007,"Pascal Dubessay, Isabelle Garreau-Balandier, Anne-Sophie Jarrousse, Annie Fleuriet, Benoit Sion, Roger Debise, Serge Alziari, Pascal Dubessay, Isabelle Garreau-Balandier, Anne-Sophie Jarrousse, Annie Fleuriet, Benoit Sion, Roger Debise, Serge Alziari"
Expression of the Drosophila melanogaster GADD45 homolog (CG11086) affects egg asymmetric development that is mediated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway,18039880,10.1534/genetics.107.079517,"The mammalian GADD45 (growth arrest and DNA-damage inducible) gene family is composed of three highly homologous small, acidic, nuclear proteins: GADD45alpha, GADD45beta, and GADD45gamma. GADD45 proteins are involved in important processes such as regulation of DNA repair, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. Annotation of the Drosophila melanogaster genome revealed that it contains a single GADD45-like protein (CG11086; D-GADD45). We found that, as its mammalian homologs, D-GADD45 is a nuclear protein; however, D-GADD45 expression is not elevated following exposure to genotoxic and nongenotoxic agents in Schneider cells and in adult flies. We showed that the D-GADD45 transcript increased following immune response activation, consistent with previous microarray findings. Since upregulation of GADD45 proteins has been characterized as an important cellular response to genotoxic and nongenotoxic agents, we aimed to characterize the effect of D-GADD45 overexpression on D. melanogaster development. Overexpression of D-GADD45 in various tissues led to different phenotypic responses. Specifically, in the somatic follicle cells overexpression caused apoptosis, while overexpression in the germline affected the dorsal-ventral polarity of the eggshell and disrupted the localization of anterior-posterior polarity determinants. In this article we focused on the role of D-GADD45 overexpression in the germline and found that D-GADD45 caused dorsalization of the eggshell. Since mammalian GADD45 proteins are activators of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, we tested for a genetic interaction in D. melanogaster. We found that eggshell polarity defects caused by D-GADD45 overexpression were dominantly suppressed by mutations in the JNK pathway, suggesting that the JNK pathway has a novel, D-GADD45-mediated, function in the Drosophila germline.",2007,"Gabriella Peretz, Anna Bakhrat, Uri Abdu, Gabriella Peretz, Anna Bakhrat, Uri Abdu"
"Histone H1-like, lysine-rich low complexity amino acid extensions in mosquito ribosomal proteins RpL23a and RpS6 have evolved independently",17212354,10.1002/arch.20163,"Histone H1-like amino acid extensions have been described at the amino terminus of Drosophila RpL22 and RpL23a, and at the carboxyl terminus of mosquito ribosomal protein RpS6. An in silico search suggested that RpL23a, but not RpL22, in Anopheles gambiae has an amino-terminal extension. Because low complexity amino acid extensions are not common on eukaryotic ribosomal proteins, and their functions are unknown, we cloned cDNAs encoding RpL23a from Aedes albopictus and Anopheles stephensi mosquito cell lines. RpL23a proteins in Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes are rich in lysine (approximately 25%), alanine (approximately 21%), and proline (approximately 8%), have a mass of approximately 40 kDa, a pI of 11.4 to 11.5, and contain an N-terminal extension of approximately 260 amino acid residues. The N-terminal extension in mosquito RpL23a is about 100 amino acids longer than that in the Drosophila RpL23a homolog, and contains several repeated amino acid motifs. Analysis of exon-intron organization in the An. gambiae and in D. melanogaster genes suggests that a short first exon encodes a series of 11 amino acid residues conserved in RpL23a proteins from Drosophila, mosquitoes, and the moth, Bombyx mori. The histone H1-like sequence in RpL23a is encoded entirely within the second exon. The C-terminal 126 amino acid residues of the RpL23a protein, encoded by exon 3 in Drosophila, and by exons 3 and 4 in Anopheles gambiae, are well conserved, and correspond to Escherichia coli RpL23 with the addition of the eukaryotic N-terminal nuclear localization sequence. Sequence comparisons indicate that the histone H1-like extensions on mosquito RpS6 and RpL23a have evolved independently of each other, and of histone H1 proteins.",2007,"Vida P Hernandez, A M Fallon, Vida P Hernandez, A M Fallon"
Revisiting the protein-coding gene catalog of Drosophila melanogaster using 12 fly genomes,17989253,10.1101/gr.6679507,"The availability of sequenced genomes from 12 Drosophila species has enabled the use of comparative genomics for the systematic discovery of functional elements conserved within this genus. We have developed quantitative metrics for the evolutionary signatures specific to protein-coding regions and applied them genome-wide, resulting in 1193 candidate new protein-coding exons in the D. melanogaster genome. We have reviewed these predictions by manual curation and validated a subset by directed cDNA screening and sequencing, revealing both new genes and new alternative splice forms of known genes. We also used these evolutionary signatures to evaluate existing gene annotations, resulting in the validation of 87% of genes lacking descriptive names and identifying 414 poorly conserved genes that are likely to be spurious predictions, noncoding, or species-specific genes. Furthermore, our methods suggest a variety of refinements to hundreds of existing gene models, such as modifications to translation start codons and exon splice boundaries. Finally, we performed directed genome-wide searches for unusual protein-coding structures, discovering 149 possible examples of stop codon readthrough, 125 new candidate ORFs of polycistronic mRNAs, and several candidate translational frameshifts.

Intron loss and gain in Drosophila,17965454,10.1093/molbev/msm235,"Although introns were first discovered almost 30 years ago, their evolutionary origin remains elusive. In this work, we used multispecies whole-genome alignments to map Drosophila melanogaster introns onto 10 other fully sequenced Drosophila genomes. We were able to find 1,944 sites where an intron was missing in one or more species. We show that for most (>80%) of these cases, there is no leftover intronic sequence or any missing exonic sequence, indicating exact intron loss or gain events. We used parsimony to classify these differences as 1,754 intron loss events and 213 gain events. We show that lost and gained introns are significantly shorter than average and flanked by longer than average exons. They also display quite distinct phase distributions and show greater than average similarity between the 5' splice site and its 3' partner splice site. Introns that have been lost in one or more species evolve faster than other introns, occur in slowly evolving genes, and are found adjacent to each other more often than would be expected for independent single losses. Our results support the cDNA recombination mechanism of intron loss, suggest that selective pressures affect site-specific loss rates, and show conclusively that intron gain has occurred within the Drosophila lineage, solidifying the ""introns-middle"" hypothesis and providing some hints about the gain mechanism.",2007,"Jasmin Coulombe-Huntington, Jacek Majewski, Jasmin Coulombe-Huntington, Jacek Majewski"
Natural polymorphism affecting learning and memory in Drosophila,17640898,10.1073/pnas.0702923104,"Knowing which genes contribute to natural variation in learning and memory would help us understand how differences in these cognitive traits evolve among populations and species. We show that a natural polymorphism at the foraging (for) locus, which encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), affects associative olfactory learning in Drosophila melanogaster. In an assay that tests the ability to associate an odor with mechanical shock, flies homozygous for one natural allelic variant of this gene (forR) showed better short-term but poorer long-term memory than flies homozygous for another natural allele (fors). The fors allele is characterized by reduced PKG activity. We showed that forR-like levels of both short-term learning and long-term memory can be induced in fors flies by selectively increasing the level of PKG in the mushroom bodies, which are centers of olfactory learning in the fly brain. Thus, the natural polymorphism at for may mediate an evolutionary tradeoff between short- and long-term memory. The respective strengths of learning performance of the two genotypes seem coadapted with their effects on foraging behavior: forR flies move more between food patches and so could particularly benefit from fast learning, whereas fors flies are more sedentary, which should favor good long-term memory.",2007,"Frederic Mery, Amsale T Belay, Anthony K-C So, Marla B Sokolowski, Tadeusz J Kawecki, Frederic Mery, Amsale T Belay, Anthony K-C So, Marla B Sokolowski, Tadeusz J Kawecki"
A proteome catalog of Drosophila melanogaster: an essential resource for targeted quantitative proteomics,18820430,10.4161/fly.4532,"Proteomic analyses are critically important for systems biology because important aspects related to the structure, function and control of biological systems are only amenable by direct protein measurements. It has become apparent that the current proteomics technologies are unlikely to allow routine, quantitative measurements of whole proteomes. We have therefore suggested and largely implemented a two-step strategy for quantitative proteome analysis. In a first step, the discovery phase, the proteome observable by mass spectrometry is extensively analyzed. The resulting proteome catalog can then be used to select peptides specific to only one protein, so-called proteotypic peptides (PTPs). It represents the basis to realize sensitive, robust and reproducible measurements based on targeted mass spectrometry of these PTPs in a subsequent scoring phase. In this Extra View we describe the need for such proteome catalogs and their multiple benefits for catalyzing the shift towards targeted quantitative proteomic analysis and beyond. We use the Insulin signaling cascade as a representative example to illustrate the limitations of currently used proteomics approaches for the specific analysis of individual pathway components, and describe how the recently published Drosophila proteome catalog already helped to overcome many of these limitations.",2007,"Christian H Ahrens, Erich Brunner, Ernst Hafen, Ruedi Aebersold, Konrad Basler, Christian H Ahrens, Erich Brunner, Ernst Hafen, Ruedi Aebersold, Konrad Basler"
Twin intromittent organs of Drosophila for traumatic insemination,17519186,10.1098/rsbl.2007.0192,"In several animals, male genitalia create insemination wounds in areas outside the genital orifice of females. I report that such traumatic insemination (TI) occurs in the Drosophila bipectinata complex (Diptera: Drosophilidae) and illustrate a previously unknown evolutionary pathway for this behaviour. Flash fixation of mating pairs revealed the dual function of the paired claw-like basal processes, previously misidentified as a bifid aedeagus: (i) penetration of the female body wall near the genital orifice and (ii) sperm transfer into the genital tract through the wounds. Basal processes in closely related species (Drosophila ananassae and Drosophila pallidosa) also wounded females but did not transfer sperm; this represents a transitional state to TI as observed in the bipectinata complex. Copulatory wounding is suggested to occur in other allied species of the Drosophila melanogaster species group, including D. melanogaster.

We analyzed the expression levels of apoptotic genes in wild type and Dmp53 null mutant animals after UV or IR using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Ark (Apaf-1 related killer) was induced in a Dmp53-dependent way upon UV treatment but not by IR, hid (head involution defective/wrinkled) was induced upon both types of DNA damage, while reaper was induced only upon IR but not UV treatment. Using microarray analysis we identified several further genes that are activated upon UV irradiation in the presence of wild type Dmp53 only. Some but not all of these genes show Dmp53-dependent activation upon IR treatment as well. These results suggest that Dmp53 activates distinct cellular pathways through regulation of different target genes after different types of DNA damage.",2007,"Zsuzsanna Ujfaludi, I M Boros, Eva BÃ¡lint, Zsuzsanna Ujfaludi, I M Boros, Eva BÃ¡lint"
Association of polymorphisms in odorant-binding protein genes with variation in olfactory response to benzaldehyde in Drosophila,17720903,10.1534/genetics.107.079731,"Adaptive evolution of animals depends on behaviors that are essential for their survival and reproduction. The olfactory system of Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as one of the best characterized olfactory systems, which in addition to a family of odorant receptors, contains an approximately equal number of odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), encoded by a multigene family of 51 genes. Despite their abundant expression, little is known about their role in chemosensation, largely due to the lack of available mutations in these genes. We capitalized on naturally occurring mutations (polymorphisms) to gain insights into their functions. We analyzed the sequences of 13 Obp genes in two chromosomal clusters in a population of wild-derived inbred lines, and asked whether polymorphisms in these genes are associated with variation in olfactory responsiveness. Four polymorphisms in 3 Obp genes exceeded the statistical permutation threshold for association with responsiveness to benzaldehyde, suggesting redundancy and/or combinatorial recognition by these OBPs of this odorant. Model predictions of alternative pre-mRNA secondary structures associated with polymorphic sites suggest that alterations in Obp mRNA structure could contribute to phenotypic variation in olfactory behavior.",2007,"Ping Wang, Richard F Lyman, Svetlana A Shabalina, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt, Ping Wang, Richard F Lyman, Svetlana A Shabalina, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt"

Little is known about the ecological role of enterococci in the GI tract consortia. To develop a tractable model for studying the roles of these organisms as commensals and pathogens, we characterized the Drosophila melanogaster microflora and examined the occurrence of enterococci in the gastrointestinal consortium of Drosophila. In a survey of laboratory-reared Drosophila and wild-captured flies, we found that Drosophila was naturally colonized by representatives of five bacterial phyla. Among these organisms were several species of enterococci, including Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus gallinaraum, and Enterococcus durans, as well as a previously detected but uncultured Enterococcus species. Drosophila could be cured of enterococcal carriage by antibiotic treatment and could be reassociated with laboratory strains. High-level colonization by a well-characterized strain expressing the enterococcal cytolysin was found to be detrimental to Drosophila compared to the effect of an isogenic, noncytolytic control.

QD-conjugated biomolecules are valuable resources for visualizing the structures and functions of biological systems both in vivo and in vitro. Here, we selected allatostatin 1, Ala-Pro-Ser-Gly-Ala-Gln-Arg-Leu-Tyr-Gly-Phe-Gly-Leu-NH2, conjugated to streptavidin-coated CdSe-ZnS QDs. This was followed by investigating the transfection of live mammalian cells with QD-allatostatin conjugates, the transport of QDs by allatostatin inside the nucleus, and the proliferation of cells in the presence of allatostatin. Also, on the basis of dose-dependent proliferation of cells in the presence of allatostatin we identified that allatostatin is not cytotoxic when applied at nanomolar levels. Considering the sequence similarity between the receptors of allatostatin in D. melanogaster and somatostatin/galanin in mammalian cells, we expected interactions and localization of allatostatin to somatostatin/galanin receptors on the membranes of 3T3 and A431 cells. However, with QD conjugation we identified that the peptide was delivered inside the cells and localized mainly to the cytoplasm, microtubules, and nucleus. These results indicate that allatostatin is a promising candidate for high-efficiency cell transfection and nucleus-specific cell labeling. Also, the transport property of allatostatin is promising with respect to label/drug/gene delivery and high contrast imaging of live cells and cell organelles. Another promising application of allatostatin is that the transport of QDs inside the nucleus would lift the limit of general photodynamic therapy to nucleus-specific photodynamic therapy, which is expected to be more efficient than photosensitization at the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm as a result of the short lifetime of singlet oxygen.",2007,"Vasudevanpillai Biju, Damodaran Muraleedharan, Ken-ichi Nakayama, Yasuo Shinohara, Tamitake Itoh, Yoshinobu Baba, Mitsuru Ishikawa, Vasudevanpillai Biju, Damodaran Muraleedharan, Ken-ichi Nakayama, Yasuo Shinohara, Tamitake Itoh, Yoshinobu Baba, Mitsuru Ishikawa"

Consequently, such sequences are subject to rapid evolutionary change. By examining the Troponin C gene family of Drosophila melanogaster, which has euchromatic and heterochromatic members, we find that protein-coding genes also evolve in response to their chromosomal location. The heterochromatic members of the family show a reduced CG content and increased variation in DNA sequence. We show that the CG reduction applies broadly to the protein-coding sequences of genes located at the heterochromatin:euchromatin interface, with a very strong correlation between CG content and the distance from centric heterochromatin. We also observe a similar trend in the transition from telomeric heterochromatin to euchromatin.

The human and Drosophila genes each encode both a cytoplasmic and a mitochondrial isoform. Using additional mutants that selectively disrupt cytoplasmic or mitochondrial protein translation, we found that cytoplasmic protein translation is required for terminal arborization of both dendrites and axons during development. In contrast, disruption of mitochondrial protein translation preferentially affects the maintenance of dendritic arborization in adults. We also provide evidence that human GARS shows equivalent functions in Drosophila, and that CMT2D causal mutations show loss-of-function properties.

Strength and pattern of linkage disequilibrium are somewhat distinct in the extensively sampled Spanish and Raleigh populations. In the Spanish population, a few sites are in strong positive association, whereas a large number of sites in the Raleigh population are associated nonrandomly but the association is not strong. Linkage disequilibrium analysis shows presence of two groups of haplotypes in the populations, each of which is fairly diverged, suggesting epistasis or inversion polymorphism. There is evidence of two forms of natural selection acting on Ddc. The McDonald-Kreitman test indicates a deficit of fixed amino acid differences between D. melanogaster and D. simulans, which may be due to negative selection. An excess of derived alleles at high frequency, significant according to the H-test, is consistent with the effect of hitchhiking. The hitchhiking may have been caused by directional selection downstream of the locus studied, as suggested by a gradual decrease of the polymorphism-to-divergence ratio. Altogether, the Ddc locus exhibits a complicated pattern of variation apparently due to several evolutionary forces. Such a complex pattern may be a result of an unusually high density of functionally important genes.",2007,"Andrey Tatarenkov, Francisco J Ayala, Andrey Tatarenkov, Francisco J Ayala"
Ancestral inference and the study of codon bias evolution: implications for molecular evolutionary analyses of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup,17957249,10.1371/journal.pone.0001065,"Reliable inference of ancestral sequences can be critical to identifying both patterns and causes of molecular evolution. Robustness of ancestral inference is often assumed among closely related species, but tests of this assumption have been limited. Here, we examine the performance of inference methods for data simulated under scenarios of codon bias evolution within the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. Genome sequence data for multiple, closely related species within this subgroup make it an important system for studying molecular evolutionary genetics. The effects of asymmetric and lineage-specific substitution rates (i.e., varying levels of codon usage bias and departures from equilibrium) on the reliability of ancestral codon usage was investigated. Maximum parsimony inference, which has been widely employed in analyses of Drosophila codon bias evolution, was compared to an approach that attempts to account for uncertainty in ancestral inference by weighting ancestral reconstructions by their posterior probabilities. The latter approach employs maximum likelihood estimation of rate and base composition parameters. For equilibrium and most non-equilibrium scenarios that were investigated, the probabilistic method appears to generate reliable ancestral codon bias inferences for molecular evolutionary studies within the D. melanogaster subgroup. These reconstructions are more reliable than parsimony inference, especially when codon usage is strongly skewed. However, inference biases are considerable for both methods under particular departures from stationarity (i.e., when adaptive evolution is prevalent). Reliability of inference can be sensitive to branch lengths, asymmetry in substitution rates, and the locations and nature of lineage-specific processes within a gene tree. Inference reliability, even among closely related species, can be strongly affected by (potentially unknown) patterns of molecular evolution in lineages ancestral to those of interest.",2007,"Hiroshi Akashi, Piyush Goel, Anoop John, Hiroshi Akashi, Piyush Goel, Anoop John"
Thermosensitive splicing of a clock gene and seasonal adaptation,18419319,10.1101/sqb.2007.72.021,"Similar to many diurnal animals, the daily distribution of activity in Drosophila exhibits a bimodal pattern with clock-controlled morning and evening peaks separated by a midday ""siesta."" In prior work, we showed that the thermosensitive splicing of a 3'-terminal intron in the RNA product from the Drosophila period (per) gene (dper) is critical for temperature-induced adjustments in the timing of evening activity. Cold temperatures enhance the splicing efficiency of this intron (termed dmpi8, Drosophila melanogaster per intron 8), an event that stimulates the daily accumulation of dper RNA and protein, leading to earlier evening activity. Conversely, warm temperatures attenuate dmpi8 splicing efficiency contributing to delayed evening activity, likely ensuring that flies avoid activity during the hot midday sun when they are at increased risk of desiccation. Here, we discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms governing the thermosensitive splicing of dmpi8 and how it contributes to seasonal changes in the daily activity patterns of Drosophila. On a broader perspective, RNA-RNA interactions likely have fundamental roles in the thermal adaptation of life forms to the daily and seasonal changes in temperature.",2007,"W-F Chen, K H Low, C Lim, I Edery, W-F Chen, K H Low, C Lim, I Edery"

"Evolution of hydra, a recently evolved testis-expressed gene with nine alternative first exons in Drosophila melanogaster",17616977,10.1371/journal.pgen.0030107,"We describe here the Drosophila gene hydra that appears to have originated de novo in the melanogaster subgroup and subsequently evolved in both structure and expression level in Drosophila melanogaster and its sibling species. D. melanogaster hydra encodes a predicted protein of approximately 300 amino acids with no apparent similarity to any previously known proteins. The syntenic region flanking hydra on both sides is found in both D. ananassae and D. pseudoobscura, but hydra is found only in melanogaster subgroup species, suggesting that it originated less than approximately 13 million y ago. Exon 1 of hydra has undergone recurrent duplications, leading to the formation of nine tandem alternative exon 1s in D. melanogaster. Seven of these alternative exons are flanked on their 3' side by the transposon DINE-1 (Drosophila interspersed element-1). We demonstrate that at least four of the nine duplicated exon 1s can function as alternative transcription start sites. The entire hydra locus has also duplicated in D. simulans and D. sechellia. D. melanogaster hydra is expressed most intensely in the proximal testis, suggesting a role in late-stage spermatogenesis. The coding region of hydra has a relatively high Ka/Ks ratio between species, but the ratio is less than 1 in all comparisons, suggesting that hydra is subject to functional constraint. Analysis of sequence polymorphism and divergence of hydra shows that it has evolved under positive selection in the lineage leading to D. melanogaster. The dramatic structural changes surrounding the first exons do not affect the tissue specificity of gene expression: hydra is expressed predominantly in the testes in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. yakuba. However, we have found that expression level changed dramatically (approximately >20-fold) between D. melanogaster and D. simulans. While hydra initially evolved in the absence of nearby transposable element insertions, we suggest that the subsequent accumulation of repetitive sequences in the hydra region may have contributed to structural and expression-level evolution by inducing rearrangements and causing local heterochromatinization. Our analysis further shows that recurrent evolution of both gene structure and expression level may be characteristics of newly evolved genes. We also suggest that late-stage spermatogenesis is the functional target for newly evolved and rapidly evolving male-specific genes.",2007,"Shou-Tao Chen, Hsin-Chien Cheng, Daniel A Barbash, Hsiao-Pei Yang"
Functional analysis of Drosophila melanogaster hexokinase Hex-A locus: multiple Initiator-like elements enhance DPE containing promoter activity,17257204,10.1111/j.1365-2583.2006.00664.x,"Flight muscle Hexokinase-A (HEX-A) is the most conserved and essential hexokinase isoenzyme among Drosophila species. In this study, the Hex-A locus, encoding the HEX-A isoenzyme, has been analysed for the elements regulating its expression. By sequencing the 5' ends of Hex-A cDNA amplified by 5' RACE, we identified a transcription start site that overlapped the Initiator and downstream promoter elements. A 214 bp sequence, encompassing transcription start sites and promoter elements, was required for minimal promoter activity. DNA sequence to the 5' end of the minimal promoter element did not demonstrate any promoter activity; however, its inclusion with the basal promoter element enhanced the promoter activity. Oligonucleotide competition and site-directed mutagenesis identified the Initiator-like sequences, TCAWT, present in this region that were responsible for enhancing the promoter activity. The Hex-A locus is expressed as a single protein in Drosophila cell line, whereas in pupae, larvae and adult flies, it is expressed as two distinct types.",2007,"P C Jayakumar, Y S Shouche, M S Patole, P C Jayakumar, Y S Shouche, M S Patole"
Drosophila cuticular proteins with the R&R Consensus: annotation and classification with a new tool for discriminating RR-1 and RR-2 sequences,17628275,10.1016/j.ibmb.2007.03.007,"The majority of cuticular protein sequences identified to date from a diversity of arthropods have a conserved region known as the Rebers and Riddiford Consensus (R&R Consensus). This consensus region has been used to query the whole genome sequence of Drosophila melanogaster. One hundred one putative cuticular proteins have been annotated. Of these, 29 had been annotated previously, and for several their authenticity as cuticular proteins had been verified by protein sequence data from isolated cuticles or by localization of their transcripts in epidermis when cuticle synthesis was occurring. The original names have been retained, and the 72 newly annotated proteins have been given names beginning with Cpr followed by the chromosomal band in which the gene is located. Proteins with the R&R Consensus can be split into three groups RR-1, RR-2 and RR-3, with some correlation to the type or region of the cuticle in which they occur. Previous classification was manual and subjective. We now have developed a tool using profile hidden Markov models that allows more objective classification.

Selection on the timing of adult emergence results in altered circadian clocks in fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster,17297149,10.1242/jeb.001354,"To investigate whether circadian clocks in fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster evolve as a consequence of selection on the timing of adult emergence, we raised four replicate populations each of early (early(1..4)) and late (late(1..4)) emerging flies by selecting for adults that emerged during the morning and the evening hours. We estimated the percentage of flies that emerged during the two selection windows to evaluate the direct response to selection, and the circadian phenotypes of adult emergence and locomotor activity rhythms under light/dark (LD) and constant darkness (DD) to assess the correlated response to selection. After 55 generations, the percentage of flies emerging during the morning window increased in the early populations, but decreased in the late populations. The percentage of flies emerging during the evening window increased in the late populations, but decreased in the early populations. The time course and waveform of emergence and locomotor activity rhythms of the selected populations diverged from each other as well as from the controls. Further, the circadian periodicity of the early populations was significantly shorter than the controls, while that of the late populations was significantly longer than the controls. The light-induced phase response curve of the selected populations differed significantly within groups as well as from the controls. Such modifications in the circadian phenotypes of the selected populations due to heritable changes in genetic architecture, in response to imposed selection pressure, suggest that the circadian clocks underlying emergence and locomotor activity rhythms in D. melanogaster evolve as a correlated response to selection on the timing of adult emergence.",2007,"Shailesh Kumar, Dhanya Kumar, Dhanashree A Paranjpe, Akarsh C R, Vijay Kumar Sharma, Shailesh Kumar, Dhanya Kumar, Dhanashree A Paranjpe, Akarsh C R, Vijay Kumar Sharma"
A method for quantifying aggression in male Drosophila melanogaster,18007606,10.1038/nprot.2007.404,"Aggressive behavior is a complex social behavior that is difficult to measure. Here, we describe a simple method for the quantitative analysis of aggression in male Drosophila melanogaster. Traditional measurements of aggressive behavior have relied on a territorial context with a food territory and a female as factors that induce or enhance aggression. The protocol described here is devoid of a food territory or a female, making it simpler than most existing methods used to measure aggressive behavior. Multiple pairs of males are tested simultaneously to obtain an average fighting score. Four parameters are used to quantify the behavior: frequency, index, latency and intensity of fighting based on unambiguous offensive fighting behaviors. The assay takes 15 min, during which time a frequency score is obtained for 20-35 pairs simultaneously. More in-depth analysis, including latency, index and intensity, can be performed on the videotaped record of the experiment. The assay is highly reproducible and requires limited resources in a simple setup.",2007,"Herman A Dierick, Herman A Dierick"
Mapping regions within cosmopolitan inversion In(3R)Payne associated with natural variation in body size in Drosophila melanogaster,17603103,10.1534/genetics.107.074336,"Associations between genotypes for inversions and quantitative traits have been reported in several organisms, but little has been done to localize regions within inversions controlling variation in these traits. Here, we use an association mapping technique to identify genomic regions controlling variation in wing size within the cosmopolitan inversion In(3R)Payne in Drosophila melanogaster. Previous studies have shown that this inversion strongly influences variation in wing size, a trait highly correlated with body size. We found three alleles from two separate regions within In(3R)Payne with significant additive effects on wing size after the additional effect of the inversion itself had been taken into account. There were also several alleles with significant genotype-by-inversion interaction effects on wing size. None of the alleles tested had a significant additive effect on development time, suggesting different genes control these traits and that clinal patterns in them have therefore arisen independently. The presence of multiple regions within In(3R)Payne controlling size is consistent with the idea that inversions persist in populations because they contain multiple sets of locally adapted alleles, but more work needs to be done to test if they are indeed coadapted.",2007,"W Jason Kennington, Ary A Hoffmann, Linda Partridge, W Jason Kennington, Ary A Hoffmann, Linda Partridge"
Identification of tightly regulated groups of genes during Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis,17224916,10.1038/msb4100112,"Time-series analysis of whole-genome expression data during Drosophila melanogaster development indicates that up to 86% of its genes change their relative transcript level during embryogenesis. By applying conservative filtering criteria and requiring 'sharp' transcript changes, we identified 1534 maternal genes, 792 transient zygotic genes, and 1053 genes whose transcript levels increase during embryogenesis. Each of these three categories is dominated by groups of genes where all transcript levels increase and/or decrease at similar times, suggesting a common mode of regulation. For example, 34% of the transiently expressed genes fall into three groups, with increased transcript levels between 2.5-12, 11-20, and 15-20 h of development, respectively. We highlight common and distinctive functional features of these expression groups and identify a coupling between downregulation of transcript levels and targeted protein degradation. By mapping the groups to the protein network, we also predict and experimentally confirm new functional associations.",2007,"Sean D Hooper, Stephanie BouÃ©, Roland Krause, Lars J Jensen, Christopher E Mason, Murad Ghanim, Kevin P White, Eileen E M Furlong, Peer Bork, Sean D Hooper, Stephanie BouÃ©, Roland Krause, Lars J Jensen, Christopher E Mason, Murad Ghanim, Kevin P White, Eileen E M Furlong, Peer Bork"
Does genetic conflict drive rapid molecular evolution of nuclear transport genes in Drosophila?,17373698,10.1002/bies.20555,"The Segregation Distorter (SD) system of Drosophila melanogaster is one the best-characterized meiotic drive complexes known. SD gains an unfair transmission advantage through heterozygous SD/SD(+) males by incapacitating SD(+)-bearing spermatids so that virtually all progeny inherit SD. Segregation distorter (Sd), the primary distorting locus in the SD complex, is a truncated duplication of the RanGAP gene, a major regulator of the small GTPase Ran, which has several functions including the maintenance of the nucleocytoplasmic RanGTP concentration gradient that mediates nuclear transport. The truncated Sd-RanGAP protein is enzymatically active but mislocalizes to the nucleus where it somehow causes distortion. Here I present data consistent with the idea that wild-type RanGAP, and possibly other loci able to influence the RanGTP gradient, has been caught up in an ancient genetic conflict that predates the SD complex. The legacy of this conflict could include the unexpectedly rapid evolution of nuclear transport-related proteins, the accumulation of chromosomal inversions, the recruitment of gene duplications, and the turnover of repetitive sequences in the centric heterochromatin.",2007,"Daven C Presgraves, Daven C Presgraves"
"Recurrent positive selection at bgcn, a key determinant of germ line differentiation, does not appear to be driven by simple coevolution with its partner protein bam",17056645,10.1093/molbev/msl141,"Surveys of nucleotide sequence polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans were performed at 2 interacting loci crucial for gametogenesis: bag-of-marbles (bam) and benign gonial cell neoplasm (bgcn). At the polymorphism level, both loci appear to be evolving under the expectations of the neutral theory. However, ratios of polymorphism and divergence for synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations depart significantly from neutral expectations for both loci consistent with a previous observation of positive selection at bam. The deviations suggest either an excess of synonymous polymorphisms or an excess of nonsynonymous fixations at both loci. Synonymous evolution appears to conform to neutrality at bam. At bgcn, there is evidence of positive selection affecting preferred synonymous mutations along the D. simulans lineage. However, there is also a significantly higher rate of nonsynonymous fixations at bgcn within D. simulans. Thus, the deviation from neutrality detected by the McDonald-Kreitman test at these 2 loci is likely due to the selective acceleration of nonsynonymous fixations. Differences in the pattern of amino acid fixations between these 2 interacting proteins suggest that the detected positive selection is not due to a simple model of coevolution.",2007,"Vanessa L Bauer DuMont, Heather A Flores, Mark H Wright, Charles F Aquadro, Vanessa L Bauer DuMont, Heather A Flores, Mark H Wright, Charles F Aquadro"
Amplification of the 1731 LTR retrotransposon in Drosophila melanogaster cultured cells: origin of neocopies and impact on the genome,17382490,10.1016/j.gene.2007.02.001,"Transposable elements (TEs), represent a large fraction of the eukaryotic genome. In Drosophila melanogaster, about 20% of the genome corresponds to such middle repetitive DNA dispersed sequences. A fraction of TEs is composed of elements showing a retrovirus-like structure, the LTR-retrotransposons, the first TEs to be described in the Drosophila genome. Interestingly, in D. melanogaster embryonic immortal cell culture genomes the copy number of these LTR-retrotransposons was revealed to be higher than the copy number in the Drosophila genome, presumably as the result of transposition of some copies to new genomic locations [Potter, S.S., Brorein Jr., W.J., Dunsmuir, P., Rubin, G.M., 1979. Transposition of elements of the 412, copia and 297 dispersed repeated gene families in Drosophila. Cell 17, 415-427; Junakovic, N., Di Franco, C., Best-Belpomme, M., Echalier, G., 1988. On the transposition of copia-like nomadic elements in cultured Drosophila cells. Chromosoma 97, 212-218]. This suggests that so many transpositions modified the genome organisation and consequently the expression of targeted genes. To understand what has directed the transposition of TEs in Drosophila cell culture genomes, a search to identify the newly transposed copies was undertaken using 1731, a LTR-retrotransposon. A comparison between 1731 full-length elements found in the fly sequenced genome (y(1); cn(1)bw(1), sp(1) stock) and 1731 full-length elements amplified by PCR in the two cell line was done. The resulting data provide evidence that all 1731 neocopies were derived from a single copy slightly active in the Drosophila genome and subsequently strongly activated in cultured cells; and that this active copy is related to a newly evolved genomic variant (Kalmykova, A.I., et al., 2004. Selective expansion of the newly evolved genomic variants of retrotransposon 1731 in the Drosophila genomes. Mol. Biol. Evol. 21, 2281-2289). Moreover, neocopies are shown to be inserted in different sets of genes in the two cell lines suggesting they might be involved in the biological and physiological differences observed between Kc and S2 cell lines.",2007,"Claude Maisonhaute, David Ogereau, AurÃ©lie Hua-Van, Pierre Capy, Claude Maisonhaute, David Ogereau, AurÃ©lie Hua-Van, Pierre Capy"
Host adaptation of a Wolbachia strain after long-term serial passage in mosquito cell lines,18836024,10.1128/AEM.01038-08,"The horizontal transfer of the bacterium Wolbachia pipientis between invertebrate hosts hinges on the ability of Wolbachia to adapt to new intracellular environments. The experimental transfer of Wolbachia between distantly related host species often results in the loss of infection, presumably due to an inability of Wolbachia to adapt quickly to the new host. To examine the process of adaptation to a novel host, we transferred a life-shortening Wolbachia strain, wMelPop, from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster into a cell line derived from the mosquito Aedes albopictus. After long-term serial passage in this cell line, we transferred the mosquito-adapted wMelPop into cell lines derived from two other mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae. After a prolonged period of serial passage in mosquito cell lines, wMelPop was reintroduced into its native host, D. melanogaster, by embryonic microinjection. The cell line-adapted wMelPop strains were characterized by a loss of infectivity when reintroduced into the original host, grew to decreased densities, and had reduced abilities to cause life-shortening infection and cytoplasmic incompatibility compared to the original strain. We interpret these shifts in phenotype as evidence for genetic adaptation to the mosquito intracellular environment. The use of cell lines to preadapt Wolbachia to novel hosts is suggested as a possible strategy to improve the success of transinfection in novel target insect species.",2008,"Conor J McMeniman, Amanda M Lane, Amy W C Fong, Denis A Voronin, IÃ±aki Iturbe-Ormaetxe, Ryuichi Yamada, Elizabeth A McGraw, Scott L O'Neill, Conor J McMeniman, Amanda M Lane, Amy W C Fong, Denis A Voronin, IÃ±aki Iturbe-Ormaetxe, Ryuichi Yamada, Elizabeth A McGraw, Scott L O'Neill"
Unprotected Drosophila melanogaster telomeres activate the spindle assembly checkpoint,18246067,10.1038/ng.2007.64,"In both yeast and mammals, uncapped telomeres activate the DNA damage response (DDR) and undergo end-to-end fusion. Previous work has shown that the Drosophila HOAP protein, encoded by the caravaggio (cav) gene, is required to prevent telomeric fusions. Here we show that HOAP-depleted telomeres activate both the DDR and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). The cell cycle arrest elicited by the DDR was alleviated by mutations in mei-41 (encoding ATR), mus304 (ATRIP), grp (Chk1) and rad50 but not by mutations in tefu (ATM). The SAC was partially overridden by mutations in zw10 (also known as mit(1)15) and bubR1, and also by mutations in mei-41, mus304, rad50, grp and tefu. As expected from SAC activation, the SAC proteins Zw10, Zwilch, BubR1 and Cenp-meta (Cenp-E) accumulated at the kinetochores of cav mutant cells. Notably, BubR1 also accumulated at cav mutant telomeres in a mei-41-, mus304-, rad50-, grp- and tefu-dependent manner.

Genotoxic evaluation of two mercury compounds in the Drosophila wing spot test,17845812,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2007.07.032,"Few studies on the genotoxicity of mercury compounds have been carried out in Drosophila melanogaster, most of them focused in the effects on germinal cells, whereas studies in somatic cells are scarce. In the present study we have analyzed for the first time the genotoxic activity of mercury (II) chloride (MC) and methyl mercury (II) chloride (MMC) in the in vivo wing somatic mutation and recombination test in Drosophila, also known as the wing spot assay. This test is based on the principle that loss of heterozygosis and the corresponding expression of the suitable recessive markers, multiple wing hairs (mwh) and flare-3 (flr(3)), can lead to the formation of mutant clones in larval cells, which are then expressed as spots on the wings of adult flies. The mercury compounds were supplied to third instar larvae (72+/-2h old) at concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 microM for mercury chloride (MC) and from 0.5 to 5 microM for methyl mercury chloride (MMC). Both mercury compounds showed high toxicity; however, MMC was more toxic than MC. The results showed that none of the three categories of mutant spots recorded (small, large, and twin) increased significantly by the treatments, independently of the dose supplied, indicating that the mercury compounds tested exhibit a lack of genotoxic activity in the wing spot assay of D. melanogaster. These results contribute to increase the genotoxicity database on the in vivo evaluation of mercury compounds in Drosophila.",2008,"Erico R Carmona, Elk Kossatz, Amadeu Creus, Ricardo Marcos, Erico R Carmona, Elk Kossatz, Amadeu Creus, Ricardo Marcos"
Abundant genetic variation in transcript level during early Drosophila development,19021738,10.1111/j.1525-142X.2008.00281.x,"Variation in gene expression may underlie many important evolutionary traits. However, it is not known at what stage in organismal development changes in gene expression are most likely to result in changes in phenotype. One widely held belief is that changes in early development are more likely to result in changes in downstream phenotypes. In order to discover how much genetic variation for transcript level is present in natural populations, we studied zygotic gene expression in nine inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster at two time points in their development. We find abundant variation for transcript level both between lines and over time; close to half of all expressed genes show a significant line effect at either time point. We examine the contribution of maternally loaded genes to this variation, as well as the contribution of variation in upstream genes to variation in their downstream targets in two well-studied gene regulatory networks. Finally, we estimate the dimensionality of gene expression in these two networks and find that-despite large numbers of varying genes-there appear to be only two factors controlling this variation.",2008,"Sergey V Nuzhdin, Danielle M Tufts, Matthew W Hahn, Sergey V Nuzhdin, Danielle M Tufts, Matthew W Hahn"
Structure of the ovaries and follicular epithelium morphogenesis in Drosophila and its kin,18648852,10.1007/s00427-008-0233-0,"In insects, the ovarian follicular epithelium morphogenesis has been intensively studied and best characterized in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. It is well established that initially identical somatic follicular cells (FCs) form a simple epithelium overlying the germline cells, but during oogenesis, they diversify into a number of morphologically distinct subpopulations each responsible for creating specific eggshell structures. In addition, some FC subpopulations (e.g. polar cells) are indispensable in establishing antero-posterior and dorso-ventral ovarian follicle axes and patterning of the developing embryo. The morphological and molecular changes that occur during follicular epithelium morphogenesis in Drosophila are frequently considered as a paradigm of the FC diversification in all flies. However, recent comparative studies indicate that, in dipterans, the functioning of the ovarian follicles is diverse, group-specific and may significantly differ from the Drosophila model system. We discuss the similarities and differences of the ovary structure and follicular epithelium morphogenesis in different dipteran groups and put them into a phylognetic context. We suggest that the migratory activity of the FCs represents an evolutionary novelty that evolved in the ancestors of higher dipterans (Brachycera). Subsequently, during evolution of this subgroup, the number of migrating FC subpopulations has gradually increased from one (in Orthorrhapha) to four (in Cyclorrhapha).",2008,"Mariusz K Jaglarz, Wieslaw Krzeminski, Szczepan M Bilinski, Mariusz K Jaglarz, Wieslaw Krzeminski, Szczepan M Bilinski"

The maximum life span was 44 days for the control group fed with a 5% fat, whereas it increased to 50 and 59 days in the GTC- and BE-supplemented groups, respectively. The 50% survival time for the control flies fed with a 5% fat diet was 30 days. In contrast, it increased to 32 and 48 days when GTC and BE were supplemented in the diet. This was consistent with a significant reduction in total body LPO level in D. melanogaster maintained on the GTC- and BE-supplemented diet. Accordingly, catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities increased significantly in the flies fed with a GTC or a BE diet compared with those fed with a control 5% fat diet. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the increase in enzymatic activities of catalase and SOD was accompanied by up-regulation of genes for catalase, copper-zinc containing SOD and manganese-containing SOD. It was concluded that GTC and BE reversed the fat-induced mortality in D. melanogaster, most likely but necessarily solely, by up-regulation of endogenous antioxidant enzymes.",2008,"Yuk Man Li, Ho Yin Edwin Chan, Xiao Qiang Yao, Yu Huang, Zhen Yu Chen, Yuk Man Li, Ho Yin Edwin Chan, Xiao Qiang Yao, Yu Huang, Zhen Yu Chen"
Social experience modifies pheromone expression and mating behavior in male Drosophila melanogaster,18789691,10.1016/j.cub.2008.07.089,"Background:
      
    

    
      The social life of animals depends on communication between individuals. Recent studies in Drosophila melanogaster demonstrate that various behaviors are influenced by social interactions. For example, courtship is a social interaction mediated by pheromonal signaling that occurs more frequently during certain times of the day than others. In adult flies, sex pheromones are synthesized in cells called oenocytes and displayed on the surface of the cuticle. Although the role of Drosophila pheromones in sexual behavior is well established, little is known about the timing of these signals or how their regulation is influenced by the presence of other flies.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We report that oenocytes contain functional circadian clocks that appear to regulate the synthesis of pheromones by controlling the transcription of desaturase1 (desat1), a gene required for production of male cuticular sex pheromones. Moreover, levels of these pheromones vary throughout the day in a pattern that depends on the clock genes and most likely also depends on the circadian control of desat1 in the oenocytes. To assess group dynamics, we manipulated the genotypic composition of social groups (single versus mixed genotypes). This manipulation significantly affects clock gene transcription both in the head and oenocytes, and it also affects the pattern of pheromonal accumulation on the cuticle. Remarkably, we found that flies in mixed social groups mate more frequently than do their counterparts in uniform groups.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      These results demonstrate that social context exerts a regulatory influence on the expression of chemical signals, while modulating sexual behavior in the fruit fly.",2008,"Joshua J Krupp, Clement Kent, Jean-Christophe Billeter, Reza Azanchi, Anthony K-C So, Julia A Schonfeld, Benjamin P Smith, Christophe Lucas, Joel D Levine, Joshua J Krupp, Clement Kent, Jean-Christophe Billeter, Reza Azanchi, Anthony K-C So, Julia A Schonfeld, Benjamin P Smith, Christophe Lucas, Joel D Levine"
A screen for genes that function in leg disc regeneration in Drosophila melanogaster,18036784,10.1016/j.mod.2007.10.003,"Many diverse animal species regenerate parts of an organ or tissue after injury. However, the molecules responsible for the regenerative growth remain largely unknown. The screen reported here aimed to identify genes that function in regeneration and the transdetermination events closely associated with imaginal disc regeneration using Drosophila melanogaster. We screened a collection of 97 recessive lethal P-lacZ enhancer trap lines for two primary criteria: first, the ability to dominantly modify wg-induced leg-to-wing transdetermination and second, for the activation or repression of the lacZ reporter gene in the blastema during disc regeneration. Of the 97 P-lacZ lines, we identified six genes (KrÃ¼ppel-homolog-1, rpd3, jing, combgap, Aly and S6 kinase) that met both criteria. Five of these genes suppress, while one enhances, leg-to-wing transdetermination and therefore affects disc regeneration. Two of the genes, jing and rpd3, function in concert with chromatin remodeling proteins of the Polycomb Group (PcG) and trithorax Group (trxG) genes during Drosophila development, thus linking chromatin remodeling with the process of regeneration.",2008,"Kimberly D McClure, Gerold Schubiger, Kimberly D McClure, Gerold Schubiger"
New candidate genes for heat resistance in Drosophila melanogaster are regulated by HSF,18759003,10.1007/s12192-008-0020-x,"The cellular heat stress response is well studied in Drosophila in respect to the role of heat shock proteins (Hsp). Hsps are molecular chaperones, highly expressed during and after exposure to numerous stress types. Hsps are all regulated by a common transcription factor, the heat shock factor (HSF), and it is known that HSF is controlling other, so far uncharacterised, heat-responsive genes. In this study, we investigate whether novel candidate genes for heat resistance, identified by microarray experiments, are regulated by HSF. The microarray experiments recently identified several strongly upregulated genes in response to a short, non-lethal heat treatment in Drosophila melanogaster. To test whether or not a subset of these genes are HSF-induced, we studied 11 currently unannotated genes using quantitative polymerase chain reaction on HSF mutant flies with a non-functional HSF at elevated temperatures. We found indication of HSF regulation in most of the studied genes, suggesting a role of these unknown genes in heat tolerance. Surprisingly, some of the genes seemed to be upregulated independent of HSF function. The high induction in response to heat, which mimics the expression profile of Hsps, implies a role in the cellular heat response of these genes as well.",2008,"Louise Toft Jensen, Morten Muhlig Nielsen, Volker Loeschcke, Louise Toft Jensen, Morten Muhlig Nielsen, Volker Loeschcke"
The correlation between recombination rate and dinucleotide bias in Drosophila melanogaster,18797953,10.1007/s00239-008-9150-0,"Revealing how recombination affects genomic sequence is of great significance to our understanding of genome evolution. The present paper focuses on the correlation between recombination rate and dinucleotide bias in Drosophila melanogaster genome. Our results show that the overall dinucleotide bias is positively correlated with recombination rate for genomic sequences including untranslated regions, introns, intergenic regions, and coding sequences. The correlation patterns of individual dinucleotide biases with recombination rate are presented. Possible mechanisms of interaction between recombination and dinucleotide bias are discussed. Our data indicate that there may be a genome-wide universal mechanism acting between recombination rate and dinucleotide bias, which is likely to be neighbor-dependent biased gene conversion.",2008,"Guoqing Liu, Hong Li, Guoqing Liu, Hong Li"
Circadian modulation of short-term memory in Drosophila,19117913,10.1101/lm.1146009,"Endogenous biological clocks are widespread regulators of behavior and physiology, allowing for a more efficient allocation of efforts and resources over the course of a day. The extent that different processes are regulated by circadian oscillators, however, is not fully understood. We investigated the role of the circadian clock on short-term associative memory formation using a negatively reinforced olfactory-learning paradigm in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that memory formation was regulated in a circadian manner. The peak performance in short-term memory (STM) occurred during the early subjective night with a twofold performance amplitude after a single pairing of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. This rhythm in memory is eliminated in both timeless and period mutants and is absent during constant light conditions. Circadian gating of sensory perception does not appear to underlie the rhythm in short-term memory as evidenced by the nonrhythmic shock avoidance and olfactory avoidance behaviors. Moreover, central brain oscillators appear to be responsible for the modulation as cryptochrome mutants, in which the antennal circadian oscillators are nonfunctional, demonstrate robust circadian rhythms in short-term memory. Together these data suggest that central, rather than peripheral, circadian oscillators modulate the formation of short-term associative memory and not the perception of the stimuli.",2008,"Lisa C Lyons, Gregg Roman, Lisa C Lyons, Gregg Roman"
"DHR51, the Drosophila melanogaster homologue of the human photoreceptor cell-specific nuclear receptor, is a thiolate heme-binding protein",19086271,10.1021/bi801691b,"Heme has been recently described as a regulating ligand for the activity of the human nuclear receptors (NR) REV-ERBalpha and REV-ERBbeta and their Drosophila homologue E75.

One of these NRs, DHR51, homologous to the human photoreceptor cell-specific nuclear receptor (PNR), specifically binds heme and exhibits a UV-visible spectrum identical to that of heme-bound E75-LBD. EPR and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy indicates that, like in E75, the heme contains a hexa-coordinated low spin ferric iron. One of its axial ligands is a tightly bound cysteine, while the other one is a histidine. A dissociation constant of 0.5 microM for the heme was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry.

Comparative genomic analysis of novel conserved peptide upstream open reading frames in Drosophila melanogaster and other dipteran species,18237443,10.1186/1471-2164-9-61,"Background:
      
    

    
      Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are elements found in the 5'-region of an mRNA transcript, capable of regulating protein production of the largest, or major ORF (mORF), and impacting organismal development and growth in fungi, plants, and animals. In Drosophila, approximately 40% of transcripts contain upstream start codons (uAUGs) but there is little evidence that these are translated and affect their associated mORF.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Analyzing 19,389 Drosophila melanogaster transcript annotations and 666,153 dipteran EST sequences we have identified 44 putative conserved peptide uORFs (CPuORFs) in Drosophila melanogaster that show evidence of negative selection, and therefore are likely to be translated. Transcripts with CPuORFs constitute approximately 0.3% of the total number of transcripts, a similar frequency to the Arabidopsis genome, and have a mean length of 70 amino acids, much larger than the mean length of plant CPuORFs (40 amino acids). There is a statistically significant clustering of CPuORFs at cytological band 57 (p = 10-5), a phenomenon that has never been described for uORFs. Based on GO term and Interpro domain analyses, genes in the uORF dataset show a higher frequency of ORFs implicated in mitochondrial import than the genome-wide frequency (p < 0.01) as well as methyltransferases (p < 0.02).
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Based on these data, it is clear that Drosophila contain putative CPuORFs at frequencies similar to those found in plants. They are distinguished, however, by the type of mORF they tend to associate with, Drosophila CPuORFs preferentially occurring in transcripts encoding mitochondrial proteins and methyltransferases. This provides a basis for the study of CPuORFs and their putative regulatory role in mitochondrial function and disease.",2008,"Celine A Hayden, Giovanni Bosco, Celine A Hayden, Giovanni Bosco"
Cdc42 and Par proteins stabilize dynamic adherens junctions in the Drosophila neuroectoderm through regulation of apical endocytosis,19064670,10.1083/jcb.200807020,"Cell rearrangements require dynamic changes in cell-cell contacts to maintain tissue integrity. We investigated the function of Cdc42 in maintaining adherens junctions (AJs) and apical polarity in the Drosophila melanogaster neuroectodermal epithelium. About one third of cells exit the epithelium through ingression and become neuroblasts. Cdc42-compromised embryos lost AJs in the neuroectoderm during neuroblast ingression. In contrast, when neuroblast formation was suppressed, AJs were maintained despite the loss of Cdc42 function. Loss of Cdc42 function caused an increase in the endocytotic uptake of apical proteins, including apical polarity factors such as Crumbs, which are required for AJ stability. In addition, Cdc42 has a second function in regulating endocytotic trafficking, as it is required for the progression of apical cargo from the early to the late endosome. The Par complex acts as an effector for Cdc42 in controlling the endocytosis of apical proteins. This study reveals functional interactions between apical polarity proteins and endocytosis that are critical for stabilizing dynamic basolateral AJs.",2008,"Kathryn P Harris, Ulrich Tepass, Kathryn P Harris, Ulrich Tepass"
"Feeding, fecundity and lifespan in female Drosophila melanogaster",18430646,10.1098/rspb.2008.0139,"Male seminal fluid proteins induce a profound remodelling of behavioural, physiological and gene signalling pathways in females of many taxa, and typically cause elevated egg production and decreased sexual receptivity. In Drosophila melanogaster, these effects can be mediated by an ejaculate 'sex peptide' (SP), which, in addition, contributes significantly to the cost of mating in females. Recent research has revealed that SP can stimulate female post-copulatory feeding, raising the possibility that the widespread female cost of mating could be due to over-feeding. In this study, we used D. melanogaster as a model to test this hypothesis. We first show that elevated post-mating feeding is dependent upon egg production and does not occur in sterile ovoD1 mutant females. This conclusion was also supported by the increase in feeding of virgin females whose egg production was experimentally elevated. We then demonstrated that sterile ovoD1 and fertile females experienced identical survival costs of mating, related to their frequency of mating and not to female feeding rate or to egg production. We conclude that female mating costs are not the result of over-feeding, but may be due to other, potentially more direct, effects of ejaculate molecules.",2008,"Andrew I Barnes, Stuart Wigby, James M Boone, Linda Partridge, Tracey Chapman, Andrew I Barnes, Stuart Wigby, James M Boone, Linda Partridge, Tracey Chapman"
Single particle EM studies of the Drosophila melanogaster origin recognition complex and evidence for DNA wrapping,18824234,10.1016/j.jsb.2008.08.006,"Hyperphosphorylation of the Drosophila melanogaster origin recognition complex (DmORC) by cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) allows nucleotide binding but inhibits the ATPase activity of Orc1, and ablates the ATP-dependent interaction of ORC with DNA. Here we present single particle electron microscopy (EM) studies of ORC bound to nucleotide in both the dephosphorylated and hyper-phosphorylated states. 3D image reconstructions show that nucleotide binding gives rise to an analogous conformation independent of phosphorylation state. At the intermediate resolution achieved in our studies, ATP promotes changes along the toroidal core of the complex with negligible differences contributed by phosphorylation. Thus, hyperphosphorylation of DmORC does not induce meso-scale rearrangement of the ORC structure. To better understand ORC's role in origin remodeling, we performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies that show the contour length of a 688bp linear DNA fragment shortens by the equivalent of approximately 130bp upon ORC binding. This data, coupled with previous studies that showed a linking number change in circular DNA upon ORC binding, suggests that ORC may wrap the DNA in a manner akin to DnaA. Based on existing data and our structures, we propose a subunit arrangement for the AAA+ and winged helix domains, and in addition, speculate on a path of the 133bp of DNA around the ORC complex.",2008,"Megan G Clarey, Michael Botchan, Eva Nogales, Megan G Clarey, Michael Botchan, Eva Nogales"
Host-parasitoid interaction as affected by interkingdom competition,17989998,10.1007/s00442-007-0900-2,"Although still underrepresented in ecological research, competitive interactions between distantly related organisms (so-called ""interkingdom competition"") are expected to be widespread in various ecosystems, with yet unknown consequences for, e.g. trophic interactions. In the model host-parasitoid system Drosophila melanogaster-Asobara tabida, toxic filamentous fungi have been shown to be serious competitors that critically affect the density-dependent survival of host Drosophila larvae. This study investigates the extent to which the competing mould Aspergillus niger affects key properties of the well-studied Drosophila-parasitoid system and how the host-parasitoid interaction influences the microbial competitor. In contrast to slightly positive density-dependent host mortality under mould-free conditions, competing A. niger mediated a strong Allee effect for parasitised larvae, i.e. mortality decreased with increasing larval density. It was found that the common toxic fungal metabolite kojic acid is not responsible for higher death rates in parasitised larvae. Single parasitised Drosophila larvae were less harmful to fungal reproduction than unparasitised larvae, but this effect vanished with an increase in larval density. As predicted from the negative effect of fungi on host survival and thus on parasitoid fitness at low larval densities, A. tabida females spent less time foraging in fungus-infested patches. Interestingly, even though high host larval densities increased host survival, parasitoids still reduced their search efforts in fungus-infested patches, indicating a benefit for host larvae from feeding in the presence of noxious mould. Thus, this experimental study provides evidence of the potentially important role of interkingdom competition in determining trophic interactions in saprophagous animal communities and the dynamics of both host-parasitoid and microbial populations.",2008,"Marko Rohlfs, Marko Rohlfs"
Evolution of a desaturase involved in female pheromonal cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis and courtship behavior in Drosophila,18207084,10.1016/j.ibmb.2007.11.005,"Drosophila species exhibit polymorphism in female pheromonal cuticular hydrocarbons, with 7-monoenes produced in Drosophila simulans and 7,11-dienes in most populations of Drosophila melanogaster (5,9-dienes in several African populations). A female-biased desaturase, desatF, expressed only in D. melanogaster is involved in the synthesis of 7,11-dienes. We investigated the role of desatF in 5,9-diene flies. We constructed a 5,9-diene strain knock-down for desatF and showed that desatF is involved in 5,9-diene formation. We also studied D. melanogaster/D. simulans hybrids. These hybrid females produced dienes and received normal courtship from D. melanogaster males, but copulation success was reduced. With D. simulans males, courtship was decreased and no copulation occurred. Hybrids with a chromosomal deletion of the D. melanogaster desatF gene had no dienes and received normal courtship from D. simulans males; depending on the D. simulans parental strain, 7-19% of them succeeded in mating. D. simulans desatF promoter region shows 21-23% gaps and 86-89% identity with D. melanogaster promoter region, the coding region 93-94% identity, depending on the strain.

By recording the rate of attraction over up to 24 hr, we could compare stimuli varying in attractiveness and characterize phenotypic parameters on the basis of individual stimuli and the whole stimulus array. Behavioral differences between strains were predominantly due to variation in a single phenotypic parameter: their overall responsiveness toward optimal and suboptimal olfactory stimuli.

Investigating divergent mechanisms of mesoderm development in arthropods: the expression of Ph-twist and Ph-mef2 in Parhyale hawaiensis,17152085,10.1002/jez.b.21135,"The evolution of mesoderm was important for the development of complex body plans as well as key organ systems. Genetic and molecular studies in the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, have provided the majority of information concerning mesoderm development in arthropods. In Drosophila, twist is necessary for the specification and correct morphogenesis of mesoderm and myocyte enhancing factor 2 (mef2) is involved downstream of twist to activate muscle differentiation. In Drosophila, mesoderm is defined by positional cues in the blastoderm embryo, while in another arthropod group, the amphipod crustaceans, cell lineage plays a greater role in defining the mesoderm. It is not known how different mechanistic strategies such as positional information vs. cell-lineage-dependent development affect the timing and use of gene networks. Here we describe the development of the mesoderm in a malacostracan crustacean, Parhyale hawaiensis, and characterize the expression of Parhyale twist and mef2 orthologues. In Parhyale, the mesoderm of the post-mandibular segments arises mainly through the asymmetric division of mesoteloblasts as the germband elongates. Ph-twist expression is seen in a subset of segmental mesoderm during germband development, but not during early cleavages when the specific mesodermal cell lineages first arise. ph-mef2 expression starts after the segmental mesoderm begins to proliferate and persists in developing musculature. While the association of these genes with mesoderm differentiation appears to be conserved across the animal kingdom, the timing of expression and relationship with different mechanisms of mesoderm development may give us greater insight into the ancestral use of these genes during mesoderm differentiation.",2008,"Alivia L Price, Nipam H Patel, Alivia L Price, Nipam H Patel"

Sexual selection and immune function in Drosophila melanogaster,18070086,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00286.x,"The evolution of immune function depends not only on variation in genes contributing directly to the immune response, but also on genetic variation in other traits indirectly affecting immunocompetence. In particular, sexual selection is predicted to trade-off with immunocompetence because the extra investment of resources needed to increase sexual competitiveness reduces investment in immune function. Additional possible immunological consequences of intensifying sexual selection include an exaggeration of immunological sexual dimorphism, and the reduction of condition-dependent immunological costs due to selection of 'good genes' (the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis, ICHH). We tested for these evolutionary possibilities by increasing sexual selection in laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster for 58 generations by reestablishing a male-biased sex ratio at the start of each generation. Sexually selected flies were larger, took longer to develop, and the males were more sexually competitive than males from control (equal sex ratio) lines. We found support for the trade-off hypothesis: sexually selected males were found to have reduced immune function compared to control males. However, we found no evidence that sexual selection promoted immunological sexual dimorphism because females showed a similar reduction in immune function. We found no evidence of evolutionary changes in the condition-dependent expression of immunocompetence contrary to the expectations of the ICHH. Lastly, we compared males from the unselected base population that were either successful (IS) or unsuccessful (IU) in a competitive mating experiment. IS males showed reduced immune function relative to IU males, suggesting that patterns of phenotypic correlation largely mirror patterns of genetic correlation revealed by the selection experiment. Our results suggest increased disease susceptibility could be an important cost limiting increases in sexual competitiveness in populations experiencing intense sexual selection. Such costs may be particularly important given the high intersex correlation, because this represents an apparent genetic conflict, preventing males from reaching their sexually selected optimum.",2008,"Kurt A McKean, Leonard Nunney, Kurt A McKean, Leonard Nunney"
Automated annotation of Drosophila gene expression patterns using a controlled vocabulary,18632750,10.1093/bioinformatics/btn347,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Regulation of gene expression in space and time directs its localization to a specific subset of cells during development. Systematic determination of the spatiotemporal dynamics of gene expression plays an important role in understanding the regulatory networks driving development. An atlas for the gene expression patterns of fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been created by whole-mount in situ hybridization, and it documents the dynamic changes of gene expression pattern during Drosophila embryogenesis. The spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression are integrated by anatomical terms from a controlled vocabulary linking together intermediate tissues developed from one another. Currently, the terms are assigned to patterns manually. However, the number of patterns generated by high-throughput in situ hybridization is rapidly increasing. It is, therefore, tempting to approach this problem by employing computational methods.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In this article, we present a novel computational framework for annotating gene expression patterns using a controlled vocabulary. In the currently available high-throughput data, annotation terms are assigned to groups of patterns rather than to individual images. We propose to extract invariant features from images, and construct pyramid match kernels to measure the similarity between sets of patterns. To exploit the complementary information conveyed by different features and incorporate the correlation among patterns sharing common structures, we propose efficient convex formulations to integrate the kernels derived from various features. The proposed framework is evaluated by comparing its annotation with that of human curators, and promising performance in terms of F1 score has been reported.",2008,"Shuiwang Ji, Liang Sun, Rong Jin, Sudhir Kumar, Jieping Ye, Shuiwang Ji, Liang Sun, Rong Jin, Sudhir Kumar, Jieping Ye"
Endogenous siRNAs derived from transposons and mRNAs in Drosophila somatic cells,18403677,10.1126/science.1157396,"Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) direct RNA interference (RNAi) in eukaryotes. In flies, somatic cells produce siRNAs from exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as a defense against viral infection. We identified endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs), 21 nucleotides in length, that correspond to transposons and heterochromatic sequences in the somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster. We also detected endo-siRNAs complementary to messenger RNAs (mRNAs); these siRNAs disproportionately mapped to the complementary regions of overlapping mRNAs predicted to form double-stranded RNA in vivo. Normal accumulation of somatic endo-siRNAs requires the siRNA-generating ribonuclease Dicer-2 and the RNAi effector protein Argonaute2 (Ago2). We propose that endo-siRNAs generated by the fly RNAi pathway silence selfish genetic elements in the soma, much as Piwi-interacting RNAs do in the germ line.",2008,"Megha Ghildiyal, HervÃ© Seitz, Michael D Horwich, Chengjian Li, Tingting Du, Soohyun Lee, Jia Xu, Ellen L W Kittler, Maria L Zapp, Zhiping Weng, Phillip D Zamore, Megha Ghildiyal, HervÃ© Seitz, Michael D Horwich, Chengjian Li, Tingting Du, Soohyun Lee, Jia Xu, Ellen L W Kittler, Maria L Zapp, Zhiping Weng, Phillip D Zamore"
Characterization of Drosophila melanogaster JmjC+N histone demethylases,18375980,10.1093/nar/gkn098,"In this article, we characterize histone demethylase activity of the entire family of JmjC+N proteins of Drosophila melanogaster. Our results show that Lid (little imaginal discs), which is structurally homologous to JARID1, demethylates H3K4me3. However, contrary to what would be inferred from its demethylase activity, lid contributes to the establishment of transcriptionally competent chromatin states as: (i) is required for histone H3 acetylation; (ii) contributes to expression of the homoeotic gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx); and (iii) antagonizes heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing (PEV). These results, which are consistent with the identification of lid as a trithorax group (trxG) gene, are discussed in the context of current models for the contribution of H3K4me3 to the regulation of gene expression. Here, we also show that the two Drosophila JMJD2 homologues, dJMJD2(1)/CG15835 and dJMJD2(2)/CG33182, are capable of demethylating both H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. dJMJD2(1)/CG15835 regulates heterochromatin organization, as its over-expression induces spreading of HP1, out of heterochromatin, into euchromatin, without affecting the actual pattern of histone modifications of heterochromatin. dJMJD2(1)/CG15835 is excluded from heterochromatin and localizes to multiple euchromatic sites, where it regulates H3K36 methylation. These results indicate that dJMJD2(1)/CG15835 contributes to delimit hetero- and euchromatic territories through the regulation of H3K36 methylation in euchromatin. On the other hand, dJARID2/CG3654 shows no demethylase activity on H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3 and H4K20me3.",2008,"Marta Lloret-Llinares, ClÃ©ment CarrÃ©, Alejandro Vaquero, Natalia de Olano, Fernando AzorÃ­n, Marta Lloret-Llinares, ClÃ©ment CarrÃ©, Alejandro Vaquero, Natalia de Olano, Fernando AzorÃ­n"
Tre1 GPCR initiates germ cell transepithelial migration by regulating Drosophila melanogaster E-cadherin,18824569,10.1083/jcb.200807049,"Despite significant progress in identifying the guidance pathways that control cell migration, how a cell starts to move within an intact organism, acquires motility, and loses contact with its neighbors is poorly understood. We show that activation of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) trapped in endoderm 1 (Tre1) directs the redistribution of the G protein Gbeta as well as adherens junction proteins and Rho guanosine triphosphatase from the cell periphery to the lagging tail of germ cells at the onset of Drosophila melanogaster germ cell migration. Subsequently, Tre1 activity triggers germ cell dispersal and orients them toward the midgut for directed transepithelial migration. A transition toward invasive migration is also a prerequisite for metastasis formation, which often correlates with down-regulation of adhesion proteins. We show that uniform down-regulation of E-cadherin causes germ cell dispersal but is not sufficient for transepithelial migration in the absence of Tre1. Our findings therefore suggest a new mechanism for GPCR function that links cell polarity, modulation of cell adhesion, and invasion.",2008,"Prabhat S Kunwar, Hiroko Sano, Andrew D Renault, Vitor Barbosa, Naoyuki Fuse, Ruth Lehmann, Prabhat S Kunwar, Hiroko Sano, Andrew D Renault, Vitor Barbosa, Naoyuki Fuse, Ruth Lehmann"
Increased expression of a cGMP-dependent protein kinase in rotation-adapted western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera L.),18549955,10.1016/j.ibmb.2008.03.011,"A new 'variant' behavior in western corn rootworm (WCR) has resulted in egg-laying into non-cornfields, compared to 'normal' deposition of eggs in cornfields, allowing these insects to circumvent crop rotation. No morphological or genetic characteristics have been defined to differentiate between the normal and variant biotypes. Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases (PKG) have been implicated in the regulation of behaviors in vertebrates, insects, and nematodes, including foraging behavior in Drosophila. A cDNA with homology to the Drosophila melanogaster foraging gene (called Dvfor1) was cloned from WCR. The deduced DvFOR1 protein is approximately 70% similar to FOR proteins in Drosophila, silkworm (Bombyx mori) and honeybee (Apis mellifera). It contains a coiled-coil region, two tandem cyclic nucleotide-binding domains, a serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain, and a serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain extension, which are all characteristically found in PKG proteins. Real-time PCR assays of foraging transcript levels in heads of normal and rotation adapted females of WCR obtained from lab-reared insect colonies indicated that the variants had higher levels (25%) of PKG expression than normals. The magnitude of this increase is similar to that observed in Drosophila rover phenotypes compared to sitter phenotypes.

Through the activities of TH Morgan and his students, Drosophila did more than any other organism to lay down the foundations of genetics as a discipline and a tool for biology. In the last third of the century, a judicious blend of classical genetics and molecular biology focused on some mutants affecting the pattern of the Drosophila larva and the adult, and unlocked the molecular mechanisms of development. Surprisingly, many of the genes identified in this exercise turned to be conserved across organisms. This observation provided a vista of universality at a fundamental level of biological activity.

Variation of success of Leptopilina boulardi in Drosophila yakuba: the mechanisms explored,18061668,10.1016/j.dci.2007.10.009,"Despite an increasing knowledge of insect immune defences and virulence strategies used by parasitoids to escape them, the mechanisms underlying variation of success between parasitoid strains are still poorly understood. We have investigated this point using two lines of the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi that differ in virulence towards Drosophila yakuba. By injecting oil drops in D. yakuba larvae parasitized by virulent IS(y) females and then dissecting the larvae at different times following injection, we demonstrate that the IS(y) line alters host encapsulation ability but only during the early parasitism period. This effect is mimicked by injecting venom gland extracts, indicating that venom proteins are likely involved in immunosuppression. By contrast, the IS(m) line, unsuccessful on D. yakuba, has no immunosuppressive effect. This variation in virulence may be explained by the striking difference we report in haemocytic profiles between IS(m)- and IS(y)-parasitized larvae.

Divergence times in Caenorhabditis and Drosophila inferred from direct estimates of the neutral mutation rate,18234705,10.1093/molbev/msn024,"Accurate inference of the dates of common ancestry among species forms a central problem in understanding the evolutionary history of organisms. Molecular estimates of divergence time rely on the molecular evolutionary prediction that neutral mutations and substitutions occur at the same constant rate in genomes of related species. This underlies the notion of a molecular clock. Most implementations of this idea depend on paleontological calibration to infer dates of common ancestry, but taxa with poor fossil records must rely on external, potentially inappropriate, calibration with distantly related species. The classic biological models Caenorhabditis and Drosophila are examples of such problem taxa. Here, I illustrate internal calibration in these groups with direct estimates of the mutation rate from contemporary populations that are corrected for interfering effects of selection on the assumption of neutrality of substitutions. Divergence times are inferred among 6 species each of Caenorhabditis and Drosophila, based on thousands of orthologous groups of genes. I propose that the 2 closest known species of Caenorhabditis shared a common ancestor <24 MYA (Caenorhabditis briggsae and Caenorhabditis sp. 5) and that Caenorhabditis elegans diverged from its closest known relatives <30 MYA, assuming that these species pass through at least 6 generations per year; these estimates are much more recent than reported previously with molecular clock calibrations from non-nematode phyla. Dates inferred for the common ancestor of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans are roughly concordant with previous studies. These revised dates have important implications for rates of genome evolution and the origin of self-fertilization in Caenorhabditis.",2008,"Asher D Cutter, Asher D Cutter"
Hsp60D is essential for caspase-mediated induced apoptosis in Drosophila melanogaster,18506601,10.1007/s12192-008-0051-3,"Apart from their roles as chaperones, heat shock proteins are involved in other vital activities including apoptosis with mammalian Hsp60 being ascribed proapoptotic as well as antiapoptotic roles. Using conditional RNAi or overexpression of Hsp60D, a member of the Hsp60 family in Drosophila melanogaster, we show that the downregulation of this protein blocks caspase-dependent induced apoptosis. GMR-Gal4-driven RNAi for Hsp60D in developing eyes dominantly suppressed cell death caused by expression of Reaper, Hid, or Grim (RHG), the key activators of canonical cell death pathway. Likewise, Hsp60D-RNAi rescued cell death induced by GMR-Gal4-directed expression of full-length and activated DRONC. Overexpression of Hsp60D enhanced cell death induced either by directed expression of RHG or DRONC. However, the downregulation of Hsp60D failed to suppress apoptosis caused by unguarded caspases in DIAP1-RNAi flies. Furthermore, in DIAP1-RNAi background, Hsp60D-RNAi also failed to inhibit apoptosis induced by RHG expression. The Hsp60 and DIAP1 show diffuse and distinct granular overlapping distributions in the photoreceptor cells with the bulk of both proteins being outside the mitochondria. Depletion of either of these proteins disrupts the granular distribution of the other. We suggest that in the absence of Hsp60D, DIAP1 is unable to dissociate from effecter and executioner caspases, which thus remain inactive.",2008,"Richa Arya, S C Lakhotia, Richa Arya, S C Lakhotia"

In this review, the role of droplets in metabolism in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the fly Drosophila melanogaster, and several mammalian sources are discussed, particularly focusing on those reactions shared by these organisms. From proteomics and older work, it is clear that droplets are important for fatty acid and sterol biosynthesis, fatty acid activation, and lipolysis. However, many droplet-associated enzymes are predicted to span a membrane two or more times, which suggests either that droplet structure is more complex than the current model posits, or that there are tightly bound membranes, particularly derived from the endoplasmic reticulum, which account for the association of several of these proteins.",2009,"Joel M Goodman, Joel M Goodman"
Birth and death of genes and functions in the beta-esterase cluster of Drosophila,19536450,10.1007/s00239-009-9236-3,"Here we analyze the molecular evolution of the beta-esterase gene cluster in the Drosophila genus using the recently released genome sequences of 12 Drosophila species. Molecular evolution in this small cluster is noteworthy because it contains contrasting examples of the types and stages of loss of gene function. Specifically, missing orthologs, pseudogenes, and null alleles are all inferred. Phylogenetic analyses also suggest a minimum of 9 gene gain-loss events; however, the exact number and age of these events is confounded by interparalog recombination. A previous enigma, in which allozyme loci were mapped to beta-esterase genes that lacked catalytically essential amino acids, was resolved through the identification of neighbouring genes that contain the canonical catalytic residues and thus presumably encode the mapped allozymes. The originally identified genes are evolving with selective constraint, suggesting that they have a ""noncatalytic"" function. Curiously, 3 of the 4 paralogous beta-esterase genes in the D. ananassae genome sequence have single inactivating (frame-shift or nonsense) mutations. To determine whether these putatively inactivating mutations were fixed, we sequenced other D. ananassae alleles of these four loci. We did not find any of the 3 inactivating mutations of the sequenced strain in 12 other strains; however, other inactivating mutations were observed in the same 3 genes.

In the proximal v - f interval, the frequency of single crossovers was increased during the whole experimental period. In particular, it was observed that the frequency of double crossovers, as well as the coefficient of coincidence first increased but then gradually decreased, finally reaching the level of the control flies, as the females aged. Map distances increased due to the mus309 mutation in both gene interval studies, but they did not change as the females aged, a result suggesting that the mus309 gene controls the distribution of DSBs to be repaired as crossovers instead of non-crossovers. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that in general the DSBs are initially independently distributed on the chromosome but non-randomly repaired so that the distribution of crossovers in the mutant flies becomes uniform, but uneven in wild-type flies. The results are consistent with the counting number model of crossover interference, based on genetic distance. On the other hand, the data are not consistent with the reaction-diffusion model based on physical distance.

The results indicated that among the seven drosomycin genes, Drs, Dro2, Dro3, Dro4, and Dro5 showed constitutive expressions. Three out of five, Dro2, Dro3, and Dro5, were able to be upregulated by simple injury. Interestingly, Drs is an only gene strongly upregulated when Drosophila was infected with microbes.

Intra-abdominal injection of CrPV into adult flies causes a lethal infection that provides a robust assay for the identification of mutants with altered sensitivity to viral infection. To gain insight into the interactions between viruses and the innate immune system, we injected wild type flies with CrPV and observed that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) were not induced and hemocytes were depleted in the course of infection. To investigate the contribution of conserved immune signaling pathways to antiviral innate immune responses, CrPV was injected into isogenic mutants of the Immune Deficiency (Imd) pathway, which resembles the mammalian Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor (TNFR) pathway.

The evolutionary dynamics of the Helena retrotransposon revealed by sequenced Drosophila genomes,19624823,10.1186/1471-2148-9-174,"Background:
      
    

    
      Several studies have shown that genomes contain a mixture of transposable elements, some of which are still active and others ancient relics that have degenerated. This is true for the non-LTR retrotransposon Helena, of which only degenerate sequences have been shown to be present in some species (Drosophila melanogaster), whereas putatively active sequences are present in others (D. simulans). Combining experimental and population analyses with the sequence analysis of the 12 Drosophila genomes, we have investigated the evolution of Helena, and propose a possible scenario for the evolution of this element.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We show that six species of Drosophila have the Helena transposable element at different stages of its evolution. The copy number is highly variable among these species, but most of them are truncated at the 5' ends and also harbor several internal deletions and insertions suggesting that they are inactive in all species, except in D. mojavensis in which quantitative RT-PCR experiments have identified a putative active copy.

      Our data suggest that Helena was present in the common ancestor of the Drosophila genus, which has been vertically transmitted to the derived lineages, but that it has been lost in some of them. The wide variation in copy number and sequence degeneration in the different species suggest that the evolutionary dynamics of Helena depends on the genomic environment of the host species.",2009,"Adriana Granzotto, FabrÃ­cio R Lopes, Emmanuelle Lerat, Cristina Vieira, Claudia M A Carareto, Adriana Granzotto, FabrÃ­cio R Lopes, Emmanuelle Lerat, Cristina Vieira, Claudia M A Carareto"
The effect of pathogens on selection against deleterious mutations in Drosophila melanogaster,19694894,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01830.x,"In natural populations, fitness is reduced by both deleterious mutations and parasites. Few studies have examined interactions between these two factors, particularly at the level of individual genes. We examined how the presence of a bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, affected the selection against each of eight deleterious mutations in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that mutations tended to become more deleterious in the presence of disease. This increase in the average selection was primarily due to three genes with the remainder showing little evidence of change.",2009,"Jadene A Young, Christopher P Yourth, Aneil F Agrawal, Jadene A Young, Christopher P Yourth, Aneil F Agrawal"
The Drosophila afadin homologue Canoe regulates linkage of the actin cytoskeleton to adherens junctions during apical constriction,19596848,10.1083/jcb.200904001,"Cadherin-based adherens junctions (AJs) mediate cell adhesion and regulate cell shape change. The nectin-afadin complex also localizes to AJs and links to the cytoskeleton. Mammalian afadin has been suggested to be essential for adhesion and polarity establishment, but its mechanism of action is unclear. In contrast, Drosophila melanogaster's afadin homologue Canoe (Cno) has suggested roles in signal transduction during morphogenesis. We completely removed Cno from embryos, testing these hypotheses. Surprisingly, Cno is not essential for AJ assembly or for AJ maintenance in many tissues. However, morphogenesis is impaired from the start. Apical constriction of mesodermal cells initiates but is not completed. The actomyosin cytoskeleton disconnects from AJs, uncoupling actomyosin constriction and cell shape change. Cno has multiple direct interactions with AJ proteins, but is not a core part of the cadherin-catenin complex. Instead, Cno localizes to AJs by a Rap1- and actin-dependent mechanism. These data suggest that Cno regulates linkage between AJs and the actin cytoskeleton during morphogenesis.",2009,"Jessica K Sawyer, Nathan J Harris, Kevin C Slep, Ulrike Gaul, Mark Peifer, Jessica K Sawyer, Nathan J Harris, Kevin C Slep, Ulrike Gaul, Mark Peifer"
Developmental profiles of PERIOD and DOUBLETIME in Drosophila melanogaster ovary,19223210,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2009.01.017,"The clock protein PERIOD (PER) displays circadian cycles of accumulation, phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and degradation in Drosophila melanogaster clock cells. One exception to this pattern is in follicular cells enclosing previtellogenic ovarian egg chambers. In these cells, PER remains high and cytoplasmic at all times of day. Genetic evidence suggest that PER and its clock partner TIMELESS (TIM) interact in these cells, yet, they do not translocate to the nucleus. Here, we investigated the levels and subcellular localization of PER in older vitellogenic follicles. Cytoplasmic PER levels decreased in the follicular cells at the onset of vitellogenesis (stage 9). Interestingly, PER was observed in the nuclei of some follicular cells at this stage. PER signal disappeared in more advanced (stage 10) vitellogenic follicles. Since the phosphorylation state of PER is critical for the progression of circadian cycle, we investigated the status of PER phosphorylation in the ovary and the expression patterns of DOUBLETIME (DBT), a kinase known to affect PER in the clock cells. DBT was absent in previtellogenic follicular cells, but present in the cytoplasm of some stage 9 follicular cells. DBT was not distributed uniformly but was present in patches of adjacent cells, in a pattern resembling PER distribution at the same stage. Our data suggest that the absence of dbt expression in the follicular cells of previtellogenic egg chambers may be related to stable and cytoplasmic expression of PER in these cells. Onset of dbt expression in vitellogenic follicles coincides with nuclear localization of PER protein.",2009,"Joanna Kotwica, Maureen K Larson, Piotr Bebas, Jadwiga M Giebultowicz, Joanna Kotwica, Maureen K Larson, Piotr Bebas, Jadwiga M Giebultowicz"
The circadian clock gene period extends healthspan in aging Drosophila melanogaster,20157575,10.18632/aging.100103,"There is increasing evidence that aging is affected by biological (circadian) clocks - the internal mechanisms that coordinate daily changes in gene expression, physiological functions and behavior with external day/night cycles. Recent data suggest that disruption of the mammalian circadian clock results in accelerated aging and increased age-related pathologies such as cancer; however, the links between loss of daily rhythms and aging are not understood. We sought to determine whether disruption of the circadian clock affects lifespan and healthspan in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. We examined effects of a null mutation in the circadian clock gene period (per(01)) on the fly healthspan by challenging aging flies with short-term oxidative stress (24h hyperoxia) and investigating their response in terms of mortality hazard, levels of oxidative damage, and functional senescence. Exposure to 24h hyperoxia during middle age significantly shortened the life expectancy in per(01) but not in control flies. This homeostatic challenge also led to significantly higher accumulation of oxidative damage in per(01) flies compared to controls. In addition, aging per(01) flies showed accelerated functional decline, such as lower climbing ability and increased neuronal degeneration compared to age-matched controls. Together, these data suggest that impaired stress defense pathways may contribute to accelerated aging in the per mutant. In addition, we show that the expression of per gene declines in old wild type flies, suggesting that the circadian regulatory network becomes impaired with age.",2009,"Natraj Krishnan, Doris Kretzschmar, Kuntol Rakshit, Eileen Chow, Jadwiga M Giebultowicz, Natraj Krishnan, Doris Kretzschmar, Kuntol Rakshit, Eileen Chow, Jadwiga M Giebultowicz"
Evolution of sexual dimorphism of wing shape in the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup,19457235,10.1186/1471-2148-9-110,"Background:
      
    

    
      Sexual dimorphism of body size has been the subject of numerous studies, but few have examined sexual shape dimorphism (SShD) and its evolution. Allometry, the shape change associated with size variation, has been suggested to be a main component of SShD. Yet little is known about the relative importance of the allometric and non-allometric components for the evolution of SShD.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We investigated sexual dimorphism in wing shape in the nine species of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. We used geometric morphometrics to characterise wing shape and found significant SShD in all nine species. The amount of shape difference and the diversity of the shape changes evolved across the group. However, mapping the divergence of SShD onto the phylogeny of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup indicated that there is little phylogenetic signal. Finally, allometry accounted for a substantial part of SShD, but did not explain the bulk of evolutionary divergence in SShD because allometry itself was found to be evolutionarily plastic.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      SShD in the Drosophila wing can evolve rapidly and therefore shows only weak phylogenetic structure. The variable contribution of allometric and non-allometric components to the evolutionary divergence of SShD and the evolutionary plasticity of allometry suggest that SShD and allometry are influenced by a complex interaction of processes.",2009,"Nelly A Gidaszewski, Michel Baylac, Christian Peter Klingenberg, Nelly A Gidaszewski, Michel Baylac, Christian Peter Klingenberg"

The present study analyzed the expression pattern of hobo and a particular type of hRSs, hobo(VAHS). Both elements were shown to be expressed as sense and antisense mRNA transcripts. Expression analysis in whole mount embryos revealed a pattern similar to that of some developmental regulatory genes. Here we suggest that cis-regulatory sequences similar to those in developmental genes exist in hobo sequences.

"A product of the bicistronic Drosophila melanogaster gene CG31241, which also encodes a trimethylguanosine synthase, plays a role in telomere protection",19240120,10.1242/jcs.035097,"Although telomere formation occurs through a different mechanism in Drosophila compared with other organisms, telomere associations result from mutations in homologous genes, indicating the involvement of similar pathways in chromosome end protection. We report here that mutations of the Drosophila melanogaster gene CG31241 lead to high frequency chromosome end fusions. CG31241 is a bicistronic gene that encodes trimethylguanosine synthase (TGS1), which forms the m3G caps of noncoding small RNAs, and a novel protein, DTL. We show that although TGS1 has no role in telomere protection, DTL is localized at specific sites, including the ends of polytene chromosomes, and its loss results in telomere associations. Mutations of ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase suppress telomere fusions in the absence of DTL. Thus, genetic interactions place DTL in an ATR-related pathway in telomere protection. In contrast to ATR kinase, mutations of ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) kinase, which acts in a partially overlapping pathway of telomere protection, do not suppress formation of telomere associations in the absence of DTL. Thus, uncovering the role of DTL will help to dissect the evolutionary conserved pathway(s) controlling ATM-ATR-related telomere protection.",2009,"Orban Komonyi, Tamas Schauer, Gabor Papai, Peter Deak, Imre M Boros, Orban Komonyi, Tamas Schauer, Gabor Papai, Peter Deak, Imre M Boros"

Comparative analysis of Pdf-mediated circadian behaviors between Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis,19153257,10.1534/genetics.108.099069,"A group of small ventrolateral neurons (s-LN(v)'s) are the principal pacemaker for circadian locomotor rhythmicity of Drosophila melanogaster, and the pigment-dispersing factor (Pdf) neuropeptide plays an essential role as a clock messenger within these neurons. In our comparative studies on Pdf-associated circadian rhythms, we found that daily locomotor activity patterns of D. virilis were significantly different from those of D. melanogaster. Activities of D. virilis adults were mainly restricted to the photophase under light:dark cycles and subsequently became arrhythmic or weakly rhythmic in constant conditions. Such activity patterns resemble those of Pdf(01) mutant of D. melanogaster. Intriguingly, endogenous D. virilis Pdf (DvPdf) expression was not detected in the s-LN(v)-like neurons in the adult brains, implying that the Pdf(01)-like behavioral phenotypes of D. virilis are attributed in part to the lack of DvPdf in the s-LN(v)-like neurons. Heterologous transgenic analysis showed that cis-regulatory elements of the DvPdf transgene are capable of directing their expression in all endogenous Pdf neurons including s-LN(v)'s, as well as in non-Pdf clock neurons (LN(d)'s and fifth s-LN(v)) in a D. melanogaster host. Together these findings suggest a significant difference in the regulatory mechanisms of Pdf transcription between the two species and such a difference is causally associated with species-specific establishment of daily locomotor activity patterns.",2009,"Jae Hoon Bahn, Gyunghee Lee, Jae H Park, Jae Hoon Bahn, Gyunghee Lee, Jae H Park"
Aversive phototaxic suppression: evaluation of a short-term memory assay in Drosophila melanogaster,19220479,10.1111/j.1601-183X.2009.00483.x,"Drosophila melanogaster is increasingly being used to model human conditions that are associated with cognitive deficits including fragile-X syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, sleep loss, etc. With few exceptions, cognitive abilities that are known to be modified in these conditions in humans have not been evaluated in fly models. One reason is the absence of a simple, inexpensive and reliable behavioral assay that can be used by laboratories that are not expert in learning and memory. Aversive phototaxic suppression (APS) is a simple assay in which flies learn to avoid light that is paired with an aversive stimulus (quinine/humidity). However, questions remain about whether the change in the fly's behavior reflects learning an association between light and quinine/humidity or whether the change in behavior is because of nonassociative effects of habituation and/or sensitization. We evaluated potential effects of sensitization and habituation on behavior in the T-maze and conducted a series of yoked control experiments to further exclude nonassociative effects and determine whether this task evaluates operant learning. Together these experiments indicate that a fly must associate the light with quinine/humidity to successfully complete the task. Next, we show that five classic memory mutants are deficient in this assay. Finally, we evaluate performance in a fly model of neurodegenerative disorders associated with the accumulation of Tau. These data indicate that APS is a simple and effective assay that can be used to evaluate fly models of human conditions associated with cognitive deficits.",2009,"L Seugnet, Y Suzuki, R Stidd, P J Shaw, L Seugnet, Y Suzuki, R Stidd, P J Shaw"

These fibers remain until after the daughter nuclei have formed during telophase.

The majority of heterozygous combinations demonstrated dominance or partial dominance for the higher insertion tendency over low insertion, while a few combinations produced results to the contrary. These could be due to a more complex genetic basis of insertion behavior than a simple dominant/recessive relationship or else to the cytoplasmic/maternal-chromosome interactions.

(2) Significant correlation was obtained between fitness and productivity (rp = 0.792 for phenotypic correlation, rg = 0.945 for genotypic correlation), between fitness and total egg-to-adult viability (rp = 0.355, rg = 0.395), and between fitness and female fecundity (rp = 0.451, rg = 0.511). (3) There was no significant correlation between total egg-to-adult viability and fecundity (rp = -0.046).

The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster contains a novel charged adipokinetic-hormone-family peptide,2117437,10.1042/bj2690315,"A member of the RPCH/AKH (red-pigment-concentrating hormone/adipokinetic hormone) family of arthropod neuropeptides was identified in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, and its structure was determined by automated Edman degradation and m.s. using fast-atom-bombardment ionization and a tandem hybrid instrument capable of high sensitivity. The sequence of this peptide, which we call 'DAKH', is pGlu-Leu-Thr-Phe-Ser-Pro-Asp-Trp-NH2 (where pGlu is pyroglutamic acid and Trp-NH2 is tryptophan carboxyamide). H.p.l.c. analyses of extracts of the three body segments revealed that more than 80% of the peptide is contained in the thorax. Although DAKH is typical of family members in its general structure and distribution in the animal, it is unique in containing a residue which is charged under physiological conditions. The evolutionary significance of this change is considered.",1990,"M H Schaffer, B E Noyes, C A Slaughter, G C Thorne, S J Gaskell, M H Schaffer, B E Noyes, C A Slaughter, G C Thorne, S J Gaskell"
DNA sequence evolution of the amylase multigene family in Drosophila pseudoobscura,1699840,,"The alpha-Amylase locus in Drosophila pseudoobscura is a multigene family of one, two or three copies on the third chromosome. The nucleotide sequences of the three Amylase genes from a single chromosome of D. pseudoobscura are presented. The three Amylase genes differ at about 0.5% of their nucleotides. Each gene has a putative intron of 71 (Amy1) or 81 (Amy2 and Amy3) bp. In contrast, Drosophila melanogaster Amylase genes do not have an intron. The functional Amy1 gene of D. pseudoobscura differs from the Amy-p1 gene of D. melanogaster at an estimated 13.3% of the 1482 nucleotides in the coding region. The estimated rate of synonymous substitutions is 0.398 +/- 0.043, and the estimated rate of nonsynonymous substitutions is 0.068 +/- 0.008. From the sequence data we infer that Amy2 and Amy3 are more closely related to each other than either is to Amy1. From the pattern of nucleotide substitutions we reason that there is selection against synonymous substitutions within the Amy1 sequence; that there is selection against nonsynonymous substitutions within the Amy2 sequence, or that Amy2 has recently undergone a gene conversion with Amy1; and that Amy3 is nonfunctional and subject to random genetic drift.",1990,"C J Brown, C F Aquadro, W W Anderson, C J Brown, C F Aquadro, W W Anderson"
Increased selection response in larger populations. I. Selection for wing-tip height in Drosophila melanogaster at three population sizes,2116358,,"The effect of population size on selection response was investigated with replicated selection lines of 40, 200 and 1000 selected parents, using Drosophila melanogaster homozygous for the mutant raised. Selection for increased wing-tip height was carried out for 55 generations, with an average selection intensity of 0.6 standard deviation. The rank order of responses in the seven individual lines was significantly in order of population size, and the variance of response among lines showed a significant effect of population size. The final mean responses (selected - controls, +/- standard errors) in the three treatments, in order of increasing population size, were 8.6 +/- 1.8 mils (three small lines), 15.1 +/- 1.3 mils (two medium lines), and 19.8 +/- 1.5 mils (two large lines). The differences between treatments seem to have emerged too rapidly to be the result of mutations, and are probably due mainly to the utilization of existing variation with greater efficiency by selection in larger populations.",1990,"K E Weber, K E Weber"

Prompt heat-shock and heat-shifted proteins associated with the nuclear matrix-intermediate filament scaffold in Drosophila melanogaster cells,2117013,,"Elevated temperatures induced the synthesis of several new proteins in Drosophila melanogaster cells. Besides the conventional heat shock (HS) proteins, another set of temperature-induced proteins has been found. These latter resemble the prompt HS proteins of mammalian cells. The prompt HS proteins of Drosophila differ from the well-known conventional HS proteins in the following properties: (1) synthesis of the prompt HS proteins is insensitive to the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, which blocks the appearance of conventional HS proteins; (2) induction of the prompt HS proteins requires a significantly higher temperature than conventional HS proteins; (3) prompt HS proteins associate strictly with the nuclear matrix-intermediate filament complex (NM-IF), while the conventional HS proteins are found in all subcellular fractions; (4) prompt HS proteins of Drosophila are induced by high temperature alone while the conventional HS proteins are also produced by a variety of stress conditions. Resinless-section electron micrographs show an altered nuclear matrix morphology in heat-shocked cells. The nuclear matrix fibers are altered in spatial distribution and have much additional electron-dense material. This added material probably reflects the soluble proteins shifted into the nuclear matrix at high temperature. The prompt HS proteins can be distinguished clearly from heat-shifted proteins by several criteria. Also, the prompt HS proteins are distinct from the heat-insensitive viral proteins of a persistent virus (HPS-1).",1990,"D A Ornelles, S Penman, D A Ornelles, S Penman"
Regulation of drosophila folylpolyglutamates during development,1704098,10.1007/BF00221061,"The polyglutamate status of reduced folates during the larval, pupal and adult stages of Drosophila melanogaster development was investigated. The chain length distribution is very similar and is predominantly pentaglutamate. Half-life estimates of the hydrolytic degradation to the monoglutamate showed larva less than pupa less than adult. This raises the possibility that polyglutamate hydrolase may have a role in regulating the total intracellular reduced folate content of the different developmental stages.",1990,"E J Duke, D G Priest, E J Duke, D G Priest"
Tolerance to 1-pentene-3-ol and to 1-pentene-3-one in relation to alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldo keto reductase (AKR) activities in Drosophila melanogaster,2128177,10.1007/BF00554379,"The detoxification of 1-pentene-3-ol (pentenol) and 1-pentene-3-one (pentenone) by Drosophila melanogaster adult flies has been studied in two homozygous lines for the AdhF and AdhS alleles (LRC lines), in their respective lines selected for tolerance to ethanol (LRSe lines) and in a homozygous strain for the Adhn4 null allele. For each line, the genotype and sex LDs50 of both compounds were estimated. Then, in order to explain the differences in LD50, both alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldo keto reductase (AKR) activities were assayed. In addition, the effects of pentenone on AKR activity were also studied. Our results show that ADH-positive flies exhibit a much higher sensitivity to pentenol than ADH-null flies. However, both ADH-positive and ADH-null flies show a similar tolerance to pentenone. Our results show that flies selected for improving tolerance to ethanol also have increased tolerance to pentenol (FF and SS flies) and pentenone (SS flies). However, this improved ability to tolerate pentenol and/or pentenone cannot be explained by changes in ADH or AKR activities. On the other hand, we have observed a beneficial effect of pentenol, but not of pentenone, in n4 flies. We also show that AKR activity is not modified by the administration of pentenone. These results suggest that, in the absence of ADH activity, pentenol may be transformed into a compound that is less toxic than pentenone and that pentenone itself might also be transformed into a less toxic compound.",1990,"J J Garrido, M Barbancho, J J Garrido, M Barbancho"

Synchronized endocytosis studied in the oocyte of a temperature-sensitive mutant of Drosophila melanogaster,1692513,10.1007/BF00318441,"This study demonstrates that endocytosis in the oocyte of Drosophila melanogaster is reversibly blocked at the stage of pit formation by the temperature-sensitive, single-gene mutant, shibirts1.

After 10 min at 29 degrees C, there was a build-up of coated pits along invaginations of the plasma membrane. Also, the endosomal compartment consisting of tubules, bulbs, and small yolk spheres, disappeared. Lowering the temperature to 19 degrees C after 10 min at 29 degrees C released a synchronized wave of endocytosis into a cytoplasm cleared of uptake-related organelles. By observing this synchronized wave after exposure to 19 degrees C for varying durations, we determined that endocytosis proceeds as follows: coated pits/vesicles----tubules----small yolk spheres----mature yolk spheres.

Colchicine, acetonitrile, propionitrile, acrylonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), griseofulvin, and cadmium chloride inhibit microtubule assembly, whereas methoxyethyl acetate (MEA) does not. Qualitatively similar results were observed with D. melanogaster and mouse brain microtubules. The in vitro results from D. melanogaster correlate well with previously published results from in vivo assays monitoring induced sex chromosome aneuploidy in that effective aneuploidogens are observed to affect microtubule assembly. The inclusion of taxol does not appear to qualitatively affect the assembly assays with the chemicals tested. In contrast with results from assembly assays, the tested aneuploidogens, including colchicine, do not promote disassembly to taxol-purified microtubules. It is possible that taxol has shifted the equilibrium and stabilized the formed microtubules to the extent that they are no longer sensitive to aneuploidogen-induced disassembly.",1990,"A Sehgal, C Osgood, S Zimmering"
Synaptic connections of PDF-immunoreactive lateral neurons projecting to the dorsal protocerebrum of Drosophila melanogaster,19941354,10.1002/cne.22210,"Recent studies in Drosophila melanogaster indicate that the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) is an important output signal from a set of major clock neurons, s-LN(v)s (small ventral lateral neurons), which transmit the circadian phase to subsets of other clock neurons, DNs (dorsal neurons). Both s-LN(v)s and DNs have fiber projections to the dorsal protocerebrum of the brain, so that this area is a conspicuous locus for coupling between different subsets of clock neurons. To unravel the neural circuits underlying the fly's circadian rhythms, we examined the detailed subcellular morphology of the PDF-positive fibers of the s-LN(v)s in the dorsal protocerebrum, focusing on their synaptic connections, using preembedding immunoelectron microscopy. To examine the distribution of synapses, we also reconstructed the three-dimensional morphology of PDF-positive varicosities from fiber profiles in the dorsal protocerebrum. The varicosities contained large dense-core vesicles (DCVs), and also numerous small clear vesicles, forming divergent output synapses onto unlabeled neurites. The DCVs apparently dock at nonsynaptic sites, suggesting their nonsynaptic release. In addition, a 3D reconstruction revealed the presence of input synapses onto the PDF-positive fibers. These were detected less frequently than output sites. These observations suggest that the PDF-positive clock neurons receive neural inputs directly through synaptic connections in the dorsal protocerebrum, in addition to supplying dual outputs, either synaptic or via paracrine release of the DCV contents, to unidentified target neurons.",2010,"Kouji Yasuyama, Ian A Meinertzhagen, Kouji Yasuyama, Ian A Meinertzhagen"

Here, we show that feeding flies with SILAC-labeled yeast leads to almost complete labeling in the first filial generation. We used these ""SILAC flies"" to investigate sexual dimorphism of protein abundance in D. melanogaster. Quantitative proteome comparison of adult male and female flies revealed distinct biological processes specific for each sex. Using a tudor mutant that is defective for germ cell generation allowed us to differentiate between sex-specific protein expression in the germ line and somatic tissue. We identified many proteins with known sex-specific expression bias. In addition, several new proteins with a potential role in sexual dimorphism were identified.

Detection of volatile indicators of illicit substances by the olfactory receptors of Drosophila melanogaster,20530374,10.1093/chemse/bjq050,"Insects can detect a large range of odors with a numerically simple olfactory system that delivers high sensitivity and accurate discrimination. Therefore, insect olfactory receptors hold great promise as biosensors for detection of volatile organic chemicals in a range of applications. The array of olfactory receptor neurons of Drosophila melanogaster is rapidly becoming the best-characterized natural nose. We have investigated the suitability of Drosophila receptors as detectors for volatiles with applications in law enforcement, emergency response, and security. We first characterized responses of the majority of olfactory neuron types to a set of diagnostic odorants. Being thus able to correctly identify neurons, we then screened for responses from 38 different types of neurons to 35 agents. We identified 13 neuron types with responses to 13 agents. As individual Drosophila receptor genes have been mapped to neuron types, we can infer which genes confer responsiveness to the neurons. The responses were confirmed for one receptor by expressing it in a nonresponsive neuron. The fly olfactory system is mainly adapted to detect volatiles from fermenting fruits.

Soon after the isolation of clock mutants in Drosophila melanogaster and Neurospora crassa, clock mutants were also isolated in Chlamydomonas. Whereas genes responsible (clock genes) in Drosophila and Neurospora mutants have been identified and these organisms have become important models for understanding the circadian clock, Chlamydomonas clock genes have not been identified and the molecular basis of the algal clock was unclear until a few years ago. Recently, reverse and forward genetic studies revealed several clock genes in Chlamydomonas. These studies unveiled that the Chlamydomonas clock consists of both original and plant-like components. Further study of the Chlamydomonas circadian clock should provide new insights into the evolution of plant clocks. Furthermore, the identification of its clock genes makes Chlamydomonas a new model for molecular studies of the circadian oscillatory mechanisms in eukaryotes.

Functional characterization of the Frost gene in Drosophila melanogaster: importance for recovery from chill coma,20532197,10.1371/journal.pone.0010925,"Background:
      
    

    
      Almost all animals, including insects, need to adapt to temperature fluctuations. The molecular basis of thermal adaptation is not well understood, although a number of candidate genes have been proposed. However, a functional link between candidate genes and thermal tolerance has rarely been established. The gene Frost (Fst) was first discovered when Drosophila flies were exposed to cold stress, but the biological function(s) of Fst has so far not been characterized. Because Fst is up-regulated after a cold stress, we tested whether it was essential for chill-coma recovery.
    

    
  


        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      A marked increase in Fst expression was detected (by RT-PCR) during recovery from cold stress, peaking at 42-fold after 2 h. The GAL4/UAS system was used to knock down expression of Fst and recovery ability was assessed in transgenic adults following 12 h of chill coma at 0 degrees C. The ability to recover from cold stress (short-, medium- and long-term) was significantly altered in the transgenic adults that had Fst silenced. These findings show that Fst plays an essential role in the recovery from chill coma in both males and females.

Evolutionary analysis of the kinesin light chain genes in the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti: gene duplication as a source for novel early zygotic genes,20615250,10.1186/1471-2148-10-206,"Background:
      
    

    
      The maternal zygotic transition marks the time at which transcription from the zygotic genome is initiated and a subset of maternal RNAs are progressively degraded in the developing embryo. A number of early zygotic genes have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster and comparisons to sequenced mosquito genomes suggest that some of these early zygotic genes such as bottleneck are fast-evolving or subject to turnover in dipteran insects. One objective of this study is to identify early zygotic genes from the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti to study their evolution. We are also interested in obtaining early zygotic promoters that will direct transgene expression in the early embryo as part of a Medea gene drive system.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Two novel early zygotic kinesin light chain genes we call AaKLC2.1 and AaKLC2.2 were identified by transcriptome sequencing of Aedes aegypti embryos at various time points. These two genes have 98% nucleotide and amino acid identity in their coding regions and show transcription confined to the early zygotic stage according to gene-specific RT-PCR analysis. These AaKLC2 genes have a paralogous gene (AaKLC1) in Ae. aegypti. Phylogenetic inference shows that an ortholog to the AaKLC2 genes is only found in the sequenced genome of Culex quinquefasciatus. In contrast, AaKLC1 gene orthologs are found in all three sequenced mosquito species including Anopheles gambiae. There is only one KLC gene in D. melanogaster and other sequenced holometabolous insects that appears to be similar to AaKLC1. Unlike AaKLC2, AaKLC1 is expressed in all life stages and tissues tested, which is consistent with the expression pattern of the An. gambiae and D. melanogaster KLC genes. Phylogenetic inference also suggests that AaKLC2 genes and their likely C. quinquefasciatus ortholog are fast-evolving genes relative to the highly conserved AaKLC1-like paralogs. Embryonic injection of a luciferase reporter under the control of a 1 kb fragment upstream of the AaKLC2.1 start codon shows promoter activity at least as early as 3 hours in the developing Ae. aegypti embryo. The AaKLC2.1 promoter activity reached ~1600 fold over the negative control at 5 hr after egg deposition.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Transcriptome profiling by use of high throughput sequencing technologies has proven to be a valuable method for the identification and discovery of early and transient zygotic genes. The evolutionary investigation of the KLC gene family reveals that duplication is a source for the evolution of new genes that play a role in the dynamic process of early embryonic development. AaKLC2.1 may provide a promoter for early zygotic-specific transgene expression, which is a key component of the Medea gene drive system.",2010,"James K Biedler, Zhijian Tu, James K Biedler, Zhijian Tu"
Pharmacological analysis of Drosophila melanogaster gamma-secretase with respect to differential proteolysis of Notch and APP,20064975,10.1124/mol.109.062471,"The gamma-secretase aspartyl protease is responsible for the cleavage of numerous type I integral membrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch. APP cleavage contributes to the generation of toxic amyloid beta peptides in Alzheimer's disease, whereas cleavage of the Notch receptor is required for normal physiological signaling between differentiating cells. Mutagenesis studies as well as in vivo analyses of Notch and APP activity in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors indicate that these substrates can be differentially modulated by inhibition of mammalian gamma-secretase, although some biochemical studies instead show nearly identical dose-response inhibitor effects on Notch and APP cleavages. Here, we examine the dose-response effects of several inhibitors on Notch and APP in Drosophila melanogaster cells, which possess a homogeneous form of gamma-secretase. Four different inhibitors that target different domains of gamma-secretase exhibit similar dose-response effects for both substrates, including rank order of inhibitor potencies and effective concentration ranges. For two inhibitors, modest differences in inhibitor dose responses toward Notch and APP were detected, suggesting that inhibitors might be identified that possess some discrimination in their ability to target alternative gamma-secretase substrates. These findings also indicate that despite an overall conservation in inhibitor potencies toward different gamma-secretase substrates, quantitative differences might exist that could be relevant for the development of therapeutically valuable substrate-specific inhibitors.",2010,"Casper Groth, W Gregory Alvord, Octavio A QuiÃ±ones, Mark E Fortini, Casper Groth, W Gregory Alvord, Octavio A QuiÃ±ones, Mark E Fortini"

PINK1 accumulation on mitochondria is both necessary and sufficient for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria, and disease-causing mutations in PINK1 and Parkin disrupt Parkin recruitment and Parkin-induced mitophagy at distinct steps. These findings provide a biochemical explanation for the genetic epistasis between PINK1 and Parkin in Drosophila melanogaster.

A mechanism of caspase regulation that has been described in mammals and nematodes involves caspase-like decoy molecules, enzymatically inactive caspase homologs that have arisen by gene duplication and acquired the ability to regulate other caspases. Caspase-like decoy molecules are not found in Drosophila melanogaster, raising the question of whether this type of caspase regulation exists in insects. Phylogenomic analysis of caspase genes from twelve Drosophila and three mosquito species revealed several examples of duplicated caspase homologs lacking critical catalytic residues, making them candidate caspase-like decoy molecules. One of these, CASPS18 from the mosquito Aedes aegypti, is a homolog of the D. melanogaster caspase Decay and contains substitutions in two critical amino acid positions, including the catalytic cysteine residue. As expected, CASPS18 lacked caspase activity, but co-expression of CASPS18 with a paralogous caspase, CASPS19, in mosquito cells or co-incubation of CASPS18 and CASPS19 recombinant proteins resulted in greatly enhanced CASPS19 activity. The discovery of potential caspase-like decoy molecules in several insect species opens new avenues for investigating caspase regulation in insects, particularly in disease vectors such as mosquitoes.",2010,"Bart Bryant, Mark C Ungerer, Qingzhen Liu, Robert M Waterhouse, Rollie J Clem, Bart Bryant, Mark C Ungerer, Qingzhen Liu, Robert M Waterhouse, Rollie J Clem"
Visualizing axons in the Drosophila central nervous system using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence,20889700,10.1101/pdb.prot5503,"How axons in the developing nervous system navigate to their correct targets is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Studies of axon guidance in the embryonic central nervous system (CNS) of Drosophila melanogaster have proved instrumental to the identification of molecules and mechanisms that regulate wiring. The relative simplicity of the Drosophila embryonic CNS, the advantages of genetic approaches, and the ability to analyze the pathfinding decisions of well-defined axon groups or even individual axons have all contributed to our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of axon guidance and target selection. In this protocol, we describe methods for using fluorescent antibody staining as well as horseradish peroxidase (HRP) immunohistochemistry to reveal axon-projection patterns and identify specific guidance molecules. In the presence of 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB), HRP forms a brown, stable precipitate that allows visualization of axon populations under white light. This can be quite advantageous when teaching basic embryonic anatomy and dissection techniques, because unlike fluorescent antibody staining, HRP can be visualized in a lighted room. HRP detection does not allow precise colocalization of signals, nor can multiple colors be visualized simultaneously. These objectives are easily achieved with fluorescent antibody staining.",2010,"Greg J Bashaw, Greg J Bashaw"
Extended longevity of Drosophila melanogaster by water and ethanol extracts of Stachys lavandulifolia,20738162,10.3109/13880201003789424,"Context:
      
    

    
      Stachyss species have been used as a medicine for centuries throughout the world. Stachys lavandulifolia Vahl. var. lavandulifolia (Lamiaceae) is of interest to researchers because the constituents such as betulinic acid, oleanolic acid, rosmarinic acid, and ursolic acid are similar to other Stachys species commonly used as an alterative in medicinal preparations.
    

    
  


        Objective:
      
    

    
       The present study investigated the effects of water extract (SLE(w)) and ethanol extract (SLE(e)) obtained from S. lavandulifolia (SLE) on the longevity of Drosophila melanogaster Meigen.
    

    
  


        Materials and methods:
      
    

    
       The effects of different concentrations of SLE (Control+DMSO; 4.0; 12.0 and 20.0 ÂµL/100 mL medium) were administered separately to female and male populations of D. melanogaster for control and SLE groups.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In all application groups, each population's longevity increased, depending on the concentration of SLE. The mean life-span of the extract groups which are applied with SLE((w)) was determined to be shorter than the extract groups which are applied with SLE((e)). For example, the maximum mean life-span applied with SLE((w)) increased from 31.86 Â± 0.92 days to 43.21 Â± 1.33 days and the maximum mean life-span applied with SLE((e)) increased from 31.86 Â± 0.92 days to 49.62 Â± 1.62 days in females.

A genome-scale protein interaction profile of Drosophila p53 uncovers additional nodes of the human p53 network,20308539,10.1073/pnas.1002447107,"The genome of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster contains a single p53-like protein, phylogenetically related to the ancestor of the mammalian p53 family of tumor suppressors. We reasoned that a comprehensive map of the protein interaction profile of Drosophila p53 (Dmp53) might help identify conserved interactions of the entire p53 family in man. Using a genome-scale in vitro expression cloning approach, we identified 91 previously unreported Dmp53 interactors, considerably expanding the current Drosophila p53 interactome. Looking for evolutionary conservation of these interactions, we tested 41 mammalian orthologs and found that 37 bound to one or more p53-family members when overexpressed in human cells. An RNAi-based functional assay for modulation of the p53 pathway returned five positive hits, validating the biological relevance of these interactions. One p53 interactor is GTPBP4, a nucleolar protein involved in 60S ribosome biogenesis. We demonstrate that GTPBP4 knockdown induces p53 accumulation and activation in the absence of nucleolar disruption. In breast tumors with wild-type p53, increased expression of GTPBP4 correlates with reduced patient survival, emphasizing a potential relevance of this regulatory axis in cancer.",2010,"Andrea Lunardi, Giulio Di Minin, Paolo Provero, Marco Dal Ferro, Marcello Carotti, Giannino Del Sal, Licio Collavin, Andrea Lunardi, Giulio Di Minin, Paolo Provero, Marco Dal Ferro, Marcello Carotti, Giannino Del Sal, Licio Collavin"
A novel pattern of follicular epithelium morphogenesis in higher dipterans,20106641,10.1016/j.zool.2009.07.002,"In fly ovaries, the follicular epithelium surrounding germline cells diversifies into several morphologically distinct cell subpopulations. This complex process is crucial for the formation of a regionally complex eggshell and establishment of polarity of the future embryo. Morphogenetic changes accompanying patterning of the follicular epithelium have been best characterized in the model fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we analyze follicular epithelium diversification in the ovaries of Tachypeza nubila, a brachyceran fly closely related to the group Cyclorrhapha, which also includes Drosophila. We provide morphological evidence that in Tachypeza, the diversification process differs from that described in the Drosophila model system in several important respects: (i) follicle cells differentiate into five subpopulations (versus eight in Drosophila); (ii) only one of these subpopulations (i.e. border cells) is migratory (versus four in Drosophila); (iii) the main body follicle cells form a uniform epithelium with no distinct border between follicle cells covering the nurse cell compartment and the oocyte; (iv) chorionic material is deposited not only on the surface of the oocyte but also on the nurse cells; (v) there is no centripetal migration of the follicle cells; (vi) the resulting eggshell is morphologically simple with no regional specializations except for the micropylar apparatus at the anterior pole of the oocyte. Our findings provide novel insights into the evolution of the follicle cell patterning and functioning in dipterans. A critical analysis of these processes in different dipteran groups strongly indicates that in Tachypeza, follicular epithelium diversification follows a distinct pattern, novel for higher dipterans.",2010,"Mariusz K Jaglarz, Janusz Kubrakiewicz, Szczepan M Bilinski, Mariusz K Jaglarz, Janusz Kubrakiewicz, Szczepan M Bilinski"

Phenotypic interactions of spinster with the genes encoding proteins for cell death control in Drosophila melanogaster,20091795,10.1002/arch.20345,"The spin gene was first identified by its mutant phenotype, which is characterized by extremely strong mate refusal by females in response to male courtship in Drosophila. Spin mutants are also known to be accompanied by a remarkable reduction in programmed cell death in the reproductive and nervous systems. To better understand the molecular functions of spin, we searched for its genetic modifiers. Forced expression of spin(+) in somatic cells as driven by ptc-Gal4 in the testis resulted in the invasion of mature sperm into the anterior testes tip, which is otherwise occupied only by immature germ cells. To obtain genes that modulate spin's effect, the gain-of-function spin phenotype was observed in the presence of a chromosome harboring an EP or GS P-element insertion, which initiates transcription of the genomic sequence neighboring the insertion site. We isolated th and emc as suppressors of spin and atg8a as a gene that reproduces the spin phenotype on its own. th encodes Inhibitor of apoptosis-1, and mammalian Id genes homologous to emc are known to inhibit apoptosis. atg8a encodes a protein essential for autophagy. These results suggest that spin promotes cell death mechanisms that are regulated negatively by th and emc and positively by atg8a.",2010,"Akira Sakurai, Yoshiro Nakano, Masayuki Koganezawa, Daisuke Yamamoto, Akira Sakurai, Yoshiro Nakano, Masayuki Koganezawa, Daisuke Yamamoto"
Natural variation in odorant recognition among odorant-binding proteins in Drosophila melanogaster,20026676,10.1534/genetics.109.113340,"Chemical recognition is essential for survival and reproduction. Adaptive evolution has resulted in diverse chemoreceptor families, in which polymorphisms contribute to individual variation in chemosensation. To gain insights into the genetic determinants of individual variation in odorant recognition, we measured olfactory responses to two structurally similar odorants in a population of wild-derived inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are the first components of the insect olfactory system to encounter odorants. Previously four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Obp99 group were associated with variation in olfactory responses to benzaldehyde. Here, we identify six different SNPs that are associated with variation in responses to a structurally similar odorant, acetophenone, in the same Obp genes. Five SNPs are in coding regions of Obp99b and Obp99d and one SNP is in the 3'-untranslated region of Obp99a (A610G). We found that the 610G allele is associated with higher response scores to acetophenone than the 610A allele, but with lower expression of Obp99a, suggesting that binding of acetophenone to Opb99a might limit rather than facilitate access to odorant receptors. Our results show that overlapping sets of OBPs contribute to odorant recognition for structurally similar odorants, but that different SNPs are associated with odorant-specific individual variation. Thus, dual olfactory recognition where OBPs regulate odorant access to receptors may enhance olfactory discrimination.",2010,"Ping Wang, Richard F Lyman, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt, Ping Wang, Richard F Lyman, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt"

Dynamic network rewiring determines temporal regulatory functions in Drosophila melanogaster development processes,20486137,10.1002/bies.200900169,"The identification of network motifs has been widely considered as a significant step towards uncovering the design principles of biomolecular regulatory networks. To date, time-invariant networks have been considered. However, such approaches cannot be used to reveal time-specific biological traits due to the dynamic nature of biological systems, and hence may not be applicable to development, where temporal regulation of gene expression is an indispensable characteristic. We propose a concept of a ""temporal sequence of network motifs"", a sequence of network motifs in active sub-networks constructed over time, and investigate significant network motifs in the active temporal sub-networks of Drosophila melanogaster. Based on this concept, we find a temporal sequence of network motifs which changes according to developmental stages and thereby cannot be identified from the whole static network.

Transposable elements in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster,20308097,10.1098/rstb.2009.0318,"Transposable elements (TEs) are families of small DNA sequences found in the genomes of virtually all organisms. The sequences typically encode essential components for the replicative transposition sequences of that TE family. Thus, TEs are simply genomic parasites that inflict detrimental mutations on the fitness of their hosts. Several models have been proposed for the containment of TE copy number in outbreeding host populations such as Drosophila. Surveys of the TEs in genomes from natural populations of Drosophila have played a central role in the investigation of TE dynamics. The early surveys indicated that a typical TE insertion is rare in a population, which has been interpreted as evidence that each TE is selected against. The proposed mechanisms of this natural selection are reviewed here. Subsequent and more targeted surveys identify heterogeneity among types of TEs and also highlight the large role of homologous and possibly ectopic crossing over in the dynamics of the Drosophila TEs. The recent discovery of germline-specific RNA interference via the piwi-interacting RNA pathway opens yet another interesting mechanism that may be critical in containing the copy number of TEs in natural populations of Drosophila.

Drosophila mitoferrin is essential for male fertility: evidence for a role of mitochondrial iron metabolism during spermatogenesis,20565922,10.1186/1471-213X-10-68,"Background:
      
    

    
      Mammals and Drosophila melanogaster share some striking similarities in spermatogenesis. Mitochondria in spermatids undergo dramatic morphological changes and syncytial spermatids are stripped from their cytoplasm and then individually wrapped by single membranes in an individualization process. In mammalian and fruit fly testis, components of the mitochondrial iron metabolism are expressed, but so far their function during spermatogenesis is unknown. Here we investigate the role of Drosophila mitoferrin (dmfrn), which is a mitochondrial carrier protein with an established role in the mitochondrial iron metabolism, during spermatogenesis.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We found that P-element insertions into the 5'-untranslated region of the dmfrn gene cause recessive male sterility, which was rescued by a fluorescently tagged transgenic dmfrn genomic construct (dmfrnvenus). Testes of mutant homozygous dmfrnSH115 flies were either small with unorganized content or contained some partially elongated spermatids, or testes were of normal size but lacked mature sperm. Testis squashes indicated that spermatid elongation was defective and electron micrographs showed mitochondrial defects in elongated spermatids and indicated failed individualization. Using a LacZ reporter and the dmfrnvenus transgene, we found that dmfrn expression in testes was highest in spermatids, coinciding with the stages that showed defects in the mutants. Dmfrn-venus protein accumulated in mitochondrial derivatives of spermatids, where it remained until most of it was stripped off during individualization and disposed of in waste bags. Male sterility in flies with the hypomorph alleles dmfrnBG00456 and dmfrnEY01302 over the deletion Df(3R)ED6277 was increased by dietary iron chelation and suppressed by iron supplementation of the food, while male sterility of dmfrnSH115/Df(3R)ED6277 flies was not affected by food iron levels.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      In this work, we show that mutations in the Drosophila mitoferrin gene result in male sterility caused by developmental defects. From the sensitivity of the hypomorph mutants to low food iron levels we conclude that mitochondrial iron is essential for spermatogenesis. This is the first time that a link between the mitochondrial iron metabolism and spermatogenesis has been shown. Furthermore, due to the similar expression patterns of some mitochondrial iron metabolism genes in Drosophila and mammals, it is likely that our results are applicable for mammals as well.",2010,"Christoph Metzendorf, Maria I Lind, Christoph Metzendorf, Maria I Lind"
Controlling anoxic tolerance in adult Drosophila via the cGMP-PKG pathway,20581270,10.1242/jeb.041319,"In this study we identify a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) cascade as a biochemical pathway critical for controlling low-oxygen tolerance in the adult fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Even though adult Drosophila can survive in 0% oxygen (anoxia) environments for hours, air with less than 2% oxygen rapidly induces locomotory failure resulting in an anoxic coma. We use natural genetic variation and an induced mutation in the foraging (for) gene, which encodes a Drosophila PKG, to demonstrate that the onset of anoxic coma is correlated with PKG activity. Flies that have lower PKG activity demonstrate a significant increase in time to the onset of anoxic coma. Further, in vivo pharmacological manipulations reveal that reducing either PKG or protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity increases tolerance of behavior to acute hypoxic conditions. Alternatively, PKG activation and phosphodiesterase (PDE5/6) inhibition significantly reduce the time to the onset of anoxic coma. By manipulating these targets in paired combinations, we characterized a specific PKG cascade, with upstream and downstream components. Further, using genetic variants of PKG expression/activity subjected to chronic anoxia over 6 h, approximately 50% of animals with higher PKG activity survive, while only approximately 25% of those with lower PKG activity survive after a 24 h recovery. Therefore, in this report we describe the PKG pathway and the differential protection of function vs survival in a critically low oxygen environment.",2010,"K Dawson-Scully, D Bukvic, M Chakaborty-Chatterjee, R Ferreira, S L Milton, M B Sokolowski, K Dawson-Scully, D Bukvic, M Chakaborty-Chatterjee, R Ferreira, S L Milton, M B Sokolowski"
A conserved role for syndecan family members in the regulation of whole-body energy metabolism,20585652,10.1371/journal.pone.0011286,"Syndecans are a family of type-I transmembrane proteins that are involved in cell-matrix adhesion, migration, neuronal development, and inflammation. Previous quantitative genetic studies pinpointed Drosophila Syndecan (dSdc) as a positional candidate gene affecting variation in fat storage between two Drosophila melanogaster strains. Here, we first used quantitative complementation tests with dSdc mutants to confirm that natural variation in this gene affects variability in Drosophila fat storage. Next, we examined the effects of a viable dSdc mutant on Drosophila whole-body energy metabolism and associated traits. We observed that young flies homozygous for the dSdc mutation had reduced fat storage and slept longer than homozygous wild-type flies. They also displayed significantly reduced metabolic rate, lower expression of spargel (the Drosophila homologue of PGC-1), and reduced mitochondrial respiration. Compared to control flies, dSdc mutants had lower expression of brain insulin-like peptides, were less fecund, more sensitive to starvation, and had reduced life span. Finally, we tested for association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human SDC4 gene and variation in body composition, metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and sleep traits in a cohort of healthy early pubertal children. We found that SNP rs4599 was significantly associated with resting energy expenditure (P = 0.001 after Bonferroni correction) and nominally associated with fasting glucose levels (P = 0.01) and sleep duration (P = 0.044). On average, children homozygous for the minor allele had lower levels of glucose, higher resting energy expenditure, and slept shorter than children homozygous for the common allele.

Dacer, a membrane-bound protein of 284 amino acids, shares homology with yeast and mammalian alkaline ceramidases. Overexpression of Dacer in High Five insect cells increases ceramidase activity in the alkaline pH range, indicating that Dacer is a bona fide alkaline ceramidase. Dacer mRNA is highly expressed in the midgut and at the pupal stage. An inactivation of Dacer by insertional mutagenesis increases the levels of ceramides in both Drosophila pupae and adult flies.

Female and male genetic contributions to post-mating immune defence in female Drosophila melanogaster,20573620,10.1098/rspb.2010.0937,"Post-mating reduction in immune defence is common in female insects, and a trade-off between mating and immunity could affect the evolution of immunity. In this work, we tested the capacity of virgin and mated female Drosophila melanogaster to defend against infection by four bacterial pathogens. We found that female D. melanogaster suffer post-mating immunosuppression in a pathogen-dependent manner. The effect of mating was seen after infection with two bacterial pathogens (Providencia rettgeri and Providencia alcalifaciens), though not after infection with two other bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). We then asked whether the evolution of post-mating immunosuppression is primarily a 'female' or 'male' trait by assaying for genetic variation among females for the degree of post-mating immune suppression they experience and among males for the level of post-mating immunosuppression they elicit in their mates. We also assayed for an interaction between male and female genotypes to test the specific hypothesis that the evolution of a trade-off between mating and immune defence in females might be being driven by sexual conflict. We found that females, but not males, harbour significant genetic variation for post-mating immunosuppression, and we did not detect an interaction between female and male genotypes. We thus conclude that post-mating immune depression is predominantly a 'female' trait, and find no evidence that it is evolving under sexual conflict.",2010,"Sarah M Short, Brian P Lazzaro, Sarah M Short, Brian P Lazzaro"
Adaptation to desiccation fails to generate pre- and postmating isolation in replicate Drosophila melanogaster laboratory populations,19817849,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00864.x,"Many laboratory speciation experiments have raised allopatric populations in different environments to determine whether reproductive isolation evolves as a byproduct of adaptation (a form of ecological speciation). Few, however, have addressed the evolution of both pre- and postmating isolation or investigated the conditions affecting the process. We present results of an evolution experiment in which 12 lines of Drosophila melanogaster were derived from a common population and then independently evolved for more than 57 generations under alternative selection treatments. Six ""desiccation"" populations had access to food and water removed during a period of their adult lives generating strong desiccation selection, and six ""starvation"" populations had access to food but not water removed for the same period, generating a mild starvation stress. Substantial divergence of cuticular hydrocarbons occurred between the desiccation and starvation populations, key traits that have been implicated in sexual isolation in Drosophila. Despite this divergence, there was no detectable premating isolation between desiccation and starvation populations and postmating isolation was asymmetrical: the fitness of F1 hybrids was reduced in the desiccation but not the starvation environment. This asymmetry was likely caused by the absence of divergent selection: adaptation to desiccation appears to have come at no cost to performance in the starvation environment. Novel environments are thought to promote the evolution of reproductive isolation.

Methoprene-tolerant (Met) in Drosophila melanogaster fulfills many of the requirements for a hormone receptor gene. A paralogous gene, germ-cell expressed (gce), possesses homology and is a candidate as a Met partner in JH action. Expression of gce was found to occur at multiple times and in multiple tissues during development, similar to that previously found for Met. To probe roles of this gene in JH action, we carried out in vivo gce over- and underexpression studies. We show by overexpression studies that gce can substitute in vivo for Met, alleviating preadult but not adult phenotypic characters. We also demonstrate that RNA interference-driven knockdown of gce expression in transgenic flies results in preadult lethality in the absence of MET. These results show that (1) unlike Met, gce is a vital gene and shows functional flexibility and (2) both gene products appear to promote JH action in preadult but not adult development.",2010,"Aaron Baumann, Joshua Barry, Shaoli Wang, Yoshihiro Fujiwara, Thomas G Wilson, Aaron Baumann, Joshua Barry, Shaoli Wang, Yoshihiro Fujiwara, Thomas G Wilson"
A screening method tuned for mRNA processing factors in human cells by evaluation of the luciferase reporter activity and the subcellular distribution of bulk poly(A)+ RNA,20622428,10.1271/bbb.100363,"Screening of mRNA export factors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster has identified a number of mRNA processing factors involved in multiple mRNA processing steps.

[Drosophila melanogaster gene Merlin interacts with the clathrin adaptor protein gene lap],20391775,,"The protein Merlin is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in the eyes and wings of Drosophila and is a homolog of the human protein encoded by the Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene whose mutations cause auricular nerve tumors. Recent studies show that Merlin and Expanded cooperatively regulate the recycling of membrane receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). By performing a search for potential genetic interactions between Merlin (Mer) and the genes important for vesicular trafficking, we found that ectopic expression in the wing pouch of the clathrin adapter protein Lap involved in clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis resulted in the formation of extra vein materials. On the one hand, coexpression of wild-type Merlin and lap in the wing pouch restored normal venation, while overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant Mer(DBB) together with lap enhanced ectopic vein formation. Using various constructs with Merlin truncated copies, we showed the C-terminal portion of the Merlin protein to be responsible for the Merlin-lap genetic interaction. Furthermore, we showed that the Merlin and Lap proteins colocalized at the cortex of the wing imaginal disc cells.",2010,"S A Kopyl, N V Dorogova, E M Akhmamet'eva, L V Omel'ianchuk, L -S Chang, S A Kopyl, N V Dorogova, E M Akhmamet'eva, L V Omel'ianchuk, L -S Chang"
Modulation of chromatin boundary activities by nucleosome-remodeling activities in Drosophila melanogaster,19995906,10.1128/MCB.00183-09,"Chromatin boundaries facilitate independent gene regulation by insulating genes from the effects of enhancers or organized chromatin. However, the mechanisms of boundary action are not well understood. To investigate whether boundary function depends on a higher order of chromatin organization, we examined the function of several Drosophila melanogaster insulators in cells with reduced chromatin-remodeling activities. We found that knockdown of NURF301 and ISWI, key components of the nucleosome-remodeling factor (NURF), synergistically disrupted the enhancer-blocking function of Fab7 and SF1 and augmented the function of Fab8. Mutations in Nurf301/Ebx and Iswi also affected the function of these boundaries in vivo. We further show that ISWI was localized on the endogenous Fab7 and Fab8 insulators and that NURF knockdown resulted in a marked increase in the nucleosome occupancy at these insulator sites. In contrast to the effect of NURF knockdown, reduction in dMi-2, the ATPase component of the Drosophila nucleosome-remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex, augmented Fab7 and suppressed Fab8. Our results provide the first evidence that higher-order chromatin organization influences the enhancer-blocking activity of chromatin boundaries. In particular, the NURF and NuRD nucleosome-remodeling complexes may regulate Hox expression by modulating the function of boundaries in these complexes. The unique responses by different classes of boundaries to changes in the chromatin environment may be indicative of their distinct mechanisms of action, which may influence their placement in the genome and selection during evolution.",2010,"Mo Li, Vladimir E Belozerov, Haini N Cai, Mo Li, Vladimir E Belozerov, Haini N Cai"
Analysis of Drosophila TRPA1 reveals an ancient origin for human chemical nociception,20237474,10.1038/nature08848,"Chemical nociception, the detection of tissue-damaging chemicals, is important for animal survival and causes human pain and inflammation, but its evolutionary origins are largely unknown. Reactive electrophiles are a class of noxious compounds humans find pungent and irritating, such as allyl isothiocyanate (in wasabi) and acrolein (in cigarette smoke). Diverse animals, from insects to humans, find reactive electrophiles aversive, but whether this reflects conservation of an ancient sensory modality has been unclear. Here we identify the molecular basis of reactive electrophile detection in flies. We demonstrate that Drosophila TRPA1 (Transient receptor potential A1), the Drosophila melanogaster orthologue of the human irritant sensor, acts in gustatory chemosensors to inhibit reactive electrophile ingestion. We show that fly and mosquito TRPA1 orthologues are molecular sensors of electrophiles, using a mechanism conserved with vertebrate TRPA1s. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that invertebrate and vertebrate TRPA1s share a common ancestor that possessed critical characteristics required for electrophile detection. These findings support emergence of TRPA1-based electrophile detection in a common bilaterian ancestor, with widespread conservation throughout vertebrate and invertebrate evolution. Such conservation contrasts with the evolutionary divergence of canonical olfactory and gustatory receptors and may relate to electrophile toxicity. We propose that human pain perception relies on an ancient chemical sensor conserved across approximately 500 million years of animal evolution.",2010,"Kyeongjin Kang, Stefan R Pulver, Vincent C Panzano, Elaine C Chang, Leslie C Griffith, Douglas L Theobald, Paul A Garrity, Kyeongjin Kang, Stefan R Pulver, Vincent C Panzano, Elaine C Chang, Leslie C Griffith, Douglas L Theobald, Paul A Garrity"
Knocking down expression of Hsp22 and Hsp23 by RNA interference affects recovery from chill coma in Drosophila melanogaster,21112994,10.1242/jeb.051003,"To protect cells from the damaging effects of environmental stresses, all organisms possess a universal stress response involving upregulation of heat shock proteins (Hsps). The mechanisms underlying chilling injuries and the subsequent recovery phase are only beginning to be understood in insects. Hsp22 and Hsp23 are both upregulated during the recovery from prolonged chill coma in Drosophila melanogaster. This prompted us to investigate the functional significance of these modulations by testing whether expression of these two small Hsps is necessary for recovery after cold stress. We used the GAL4/UAS system to separately knock down expression of Hsp22 and Hsp23, and assayed three aspects of recovery performance in transgenic adults that had undergone 12 h of chill coma at 0Â°C. The time to recover (short-term recovery) and mobility parameters (medium-term recovery) were significantly impaired in the transgenic flies in which Hsp22 or Hsp23 was suppressed. Our findings show that both Hsp22 and Hsp23 play important roles in the recovery from chill coma in adult males, and suggest that these contribute to adaptive responses to fluctuating thermal conditions.",2010,"HervÃ© Colinet, Siu Fai Lee, Ary Hoffmann, HervÃ© Colinet, Siu Fai Lee, Ary Hoffmann"
Structure-function analysis of the short splicing variant carboxypeptidase encoded by Drosophila melanogaster silver,20600119,10.1016/j.jmb.2010.06.035,"Drosophila melanogaster silver gene is the ortholog of the coding gene of mammalian carboxypeptidase D (CPD). The silver gene gives rise to eight different splicing variants of differing length that can contain up to three homologous repeats. Among the protein variants encoded, the short form 1B alias DmCPD1Bs (D. melanogaster CPD variant 1B short) is necessary and sufficient for viability of the fruit fly. It has one single repeat, it is active against standard peptide substrates, and it is localized to the secretory pathway. In this work, the enzyme was found as a monomer in solution and as a homodimer in the crystal structure, which features a protomer with an N-terminal 311-residue catalytic domain of alpha/beta-hydrolase fold and a C-terminal 84-residue all-beta transthyretin-like domain. Overall, DmCPD1Bs conforms to the structure of N/E-type funnelins/M14B metallopeptidases, but it has two unique structural elements potentially involved in regulation of its activity: (i) two contiguous surface cysteines that may become palmitoylated and target the enzyme to membranes, thus providing control through localization, and (ii) a surface hot spot targetable by peptidases that would provide a regulatory mechanism through proteolytic inactivation. Given that the fruit fly possesses orthologs of only two out of the five proteolytically competent N/E-type funnelins found in higher vertebrates, DmCPD1Bs may represent a functional analog of at least one of the missing mammalian CPs.",2010,"SebastiÃ¡n Tanco, Joan L Arolas, Tibisay Guevara, Julia Lorenzo, Francesc X AvilÃ©s, F Xavier Gomis-RÃ¼th, SebastiÃ¡n Tanco, Joan L Arolas, Tibisay Guevara, Julia Lorenzo, Francesc X AvilÃ©s, F Xavier Gomis-RÃ¼th"
Transcriptional networks for alcohol sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster,21270389,10.1534/genetics.110.125229,"Understanding the genetic architecture of polygenic traits requires investigating how complex networks of interacting molecules mediate the effect of genetic variation on organismal phenotypes. We used a combination of P-element mutagenesis and analysis of natural variation in gene expression to predict transcriptional networks that underlie alcohol sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster. We identified 139 unique P-element mutations (124 in genes) that affect sensitivity or resistance to alcohol exposure. Further analyses of nine of the lines showed that the P-elements affected expression levels of the tagged genes, and P-element excision resulted in phenotypic reversion. The majority of the mutations were in computationally predicted genes or genes with unexpected effects on alcohol phenotypes. Therefore we sought to understand the biological relationships among 21 of these genes by leveraging genetic correlations among genetically variable transcripts in wild-derived inbred lines to predict coregulated transcriptional networks. A total of 32 ""hub"" genes were common to two or more networks associated with the focal genes. We used RNAi-mediated inhibition of expression of focal genes and of hub genes connected to them in the network to confirm their effects on alcohol-related phenotypes. We then expanded the computational networks using the hub genes as foci and again validated network predictions. Iteration of this approach allows a stepwise expansion of the network with simultaneous functional validation. Although coregulated transcriptional networks do not provide information about causal relationships among their constituent transcripts, they provide a framework for subsequent functional studies on the genetic basis of alcohol sensitivity.",2011,"Tatiana V Morozova, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt, Tatiana V Morozova, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt"
The clock input to the first optic neuropil of Drosophila melanogaster expressing neuronal circadian plasticity,21760878,10.1371/journal.pone.0021258,"In the first optic neuropil (lamina) of the fly's visual system, two interneurons, L1 and L2 monopolar cells, and epithelial glial cells show circadian rhythms in morphological plasticity. These rhythms depend on clock gene period (per) and cryptochrome (cry) expression. In the present study, we found that rhythms in the lamina of Drosophila melanogaster may be regulated by circadian clock neurons in the brain since the lamina is invaded by one neurite extending from ventral lateral neurons; the so-called pacemaker neurons. These neurons and the projection to the lamina were visualized by green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP reporter gene expression was driven by the cry promotor in cry-GAL4/UAS-GFP transgenic lines. We observed that the neuron projecting to the lamina forms arborizations of varicose fibers in the distal lamina. These varicose fibers do not form synaptic contacts with the lamina cells and are immunoreactive to the antisera raised against a specific region of Schistocerca gregaria ion transport peptide (ITP). ITP released in a paracrine way in the lamina cortex, may regulate the swelling and shrinking rhythms of the lamina monopolar cells and the glia by controlling the transport of ions and fluids across cell membranes at particular times of the day.",2011,"Milena Damulewicz, Elzbieta Pyza, Milena Damulewicz, Elzbieta Pyza"

Mitochondrial fusion is regulated by Reaper to modulate Drosophila programmed cell death,21475305,10.1038/cdd.2011.26,"In most multicellular organisms, the decision to undergo programmed cell death in response to cellular damage or developmental cues is typically transmitted through mitochondria. It has been suggested that an exception is the apoptotic pathway of Drosophila melanogaster, in which the role of mitochondria remains unclear. Although IAP antagonists in Drosophila such as Reaper, Hid and Grim may induce cell death without mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, it is surprising that all three localize to mitochondria. Moreover, induction of Reaper and Hid appears to result in mitochondrial fragmentation during Drosophila cell death. Most importantly, disruption of mitochondrial fission can inhibit Reaper and Hid-induced cell death, suggesting that alterations in mitochondrial dynamics can modulate cell death in fly cells. We report here that Drosophila Reaper can induce mitochondrial fragmentation by binding to and inhibiting the pro-fusion protein MFN2 and its Drosophila counterpart dMFN/Marf. Our in vitro and in vivo analyses reveal that dMFN overexpression can inhibit cell death induced by Reaper or Î³-irradiation.

Different from new genes originated through RNA-based duplication (retroposition) which are usually testis-specific or male-specific expressed, the expression patterns of these new genes through DNA-based exon shuffling are temporally and spatially diverse, implying that they may have the potential to evolve various biological functions despite that they may become pseudogenes or non-protein-coding RNA genes.",2011,"Zu-Bing Zhan, Yue Zhang, Ruo-Ping Zhao, Wen Wang, Zu-Bing Zhan, Yue Zhang, Ruo-Ping Zhao, Wen Wang"

Individual and group behavioral tests revealed different preferences in larvae and adults. Larvae preferred UFAs whereas SFAs tended to induce both a strong aversion and a persistent aggregation behavior. Adults generally preferred SFAs, and laid more eggs and had a longer life span when ingesting these substances as compared to UFAs.

Here, we used RNAi-mediated suppression of Obp gene expression and measurements of behavioral responses to 16 ecologically relevant odorants to systematically dissect the functions of 17 OBPs. We quantified the effectiveness of RNAi-mediated suppression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and used a proteomic liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry procedure to show target-specific suppression of OBPs expressed in the antennae. Flies in which expression of a specific OBP is suppressed often show altered behavioral responses to more than one, but not all, odorants, in a sex-dependent manner. Similarly, responses to a specific odorant are frequently affected by suppression of expression of multiple, but not all, OBPs.

Attention in Drosophila,21906536,10.1016/B978-0-12-387003-2.00003-3,"As bluntly summarized by a psychologist over a century ago, everyone knows what attention is [James (1890). The Principles of Psychology]. Attention describes our capacity to focus perception on one or a group of related stimuli while filtering out irrelevant stimuli. The ease we have in recognizing this astounding capacity in ourselves is matched by a surprising difficulty in identifying it in others, and this is especially the case for measuring attention in other animals. Identifying and measuring attention-like processes in simple animals such as flies requires, to some extent, even more rigor than asking the same question for our closer animal relatives, such as apes and monkeys. This is because flies have completely different brains than humans do, so to study attention in these creatures one must rely purely on operational or behavioral measures rather than comparative neuroanatomy. There is a long history of using sophisticated behavioral paradigms to study visual responses in Drosophila melanogaster, and these studies have often provided early evidence of attention-like processes in flies. More recently, these fly paradigms have been applied to measuring visual attention directly, and the combination of electrophysiology with these preparations has provided insight into how a fly might pay attention. Together with more efficient methods for measuring some aspects of attention, such as stimulus suppression, these approaches should begin to uncover how visual attention might work in a small brain.",2011,"Bruno van Swinderen, Bruno van Swinderen"
Sex chromosome-specific regulation in the Drosophila male germline but little evidence for chromosomal dosage compensation or meiotic inactivation,21857805,10.1371/journal.pbio.1001126,"The evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes (e.g., XY in males or ZW in females) has repeatedly elicited the evolution of two kinds of chromosome-specific regulation: dosage compensation--the equalization of X chromosome gene expression in males and females--and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI)--the transcriptional silencing and heterochromatinization of the X during meiosis in the male (or Z in the female) germline. How the X chromosome is regulated in the Drosophila melanogaster male germline is unclear. Here we report three new findings concerning gene expression from the X in Drosophila testes. First, X chromosome-wide dosage compensation appears to be absent from most of the Drosophila male germline. Second, microarray analysis provides no evidence for X chromosome-specific inactivation during meiosis. Third, we confirm the previous discovery that the expression of transgene reporters driven by autosomal spermatogenesis-specific promoters is strongly reduced when inserted on the X chromosome versus the autosomes; but we show that this chromosomal difference in expression is established in premeiotic cells and persists in meiotic cells. The magnitude of the X-autosome difference in transgene expression cannot be explained by the absence of dosage compensation, suggesting that a previously unrecognized mechanism limits expression from the X during spermatogenesis in Drosophila. These findings help to resolve several previously conflicting reports and have implications for patterns of genome evolution and speciation in Drosophila.",2011,"Colin D Meiklejohn, Emily L Landeen, Jodi M Cook, Sarah B Kingan, Daven C Presgraves, Colin D Meiklejohn, Emily L Landeen, Jodi M Cook, Sarah B Kingan, Daven C Presgraves"
Polymorphism in the couch potato gene clines in eastern Australia but is not associated with ovarian dormancy in Drosophila melanogaster,21689187,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05155.x,"Natural selection can generate parallel latitudinal clines in traits and gene frequencies across continents, but these have rarely been linked. An amino acid (isoleucine to lysine, or I462K) polymorphism of the couch potato (cpo) gene in Drosophila melanogaster is thought to control female reproductive diapause cline in North America (Schmidt et al. 2008, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 105, 16207-16211). Here, we show that under standard diapause-inducing conditions (12 Â°C and short photoperiod) (Saunders et al. 1989, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 86, 3748-3752), egg maturation in Australian flies is delayed, but not arrested at previtellogenic stages. At 12 Â°C, the phenotypic distribution in egg development was bimodal at stages 8 and 14 and showed a strong nonlinear pattern on the east coast of Australia, with incidence of egg maturation delay (ovarian dormancy) increasing both toward tropical and temperate climates. Furthermore, we found no evidence for an association between the cpo I462K polymorphism and ovarian dormancy at either 12 or 10 Â°C (when egg maturation was often delayed at stage 7). Owing to strong linkage disequilibrium, the latitudinal cline in cpo allele frequencies was no longer evident once variation in the In(3R)P inversion polymorphism was taken into account. Our results suggest that the standard diapause-inducing conditions (12 Â°C and short photoperiod) were not sufficient to cause the typical previtellogenic developmental arrest in Australian flies and that the cpo I462K polymorphism does not explain the observed delay in egg development. In conclusion, ovarian dormancy does not show a simple latitudinal cline, and the lack of cpo-dormancy association suggests a different genetic basis to reproductive dormancy in North America and Australia.",2011,"Siu F Lee, Carla M SgrÃ², Jennifer Shirriffs, Choon W Wee, Lea Rako, Belinda van Heerwaarden, Ary A Hoffmann, Siu F Lee, Carla M SgrÃ², Jennifer Shirriffs, Choon W Wee, Lea Rako, Belinda van Heerwaarden, Ary A Hoffmann"
A potential role for the clathrin adaptor GGA in Drosophila spermatogenesis,21599933,10.1186/1471-2121-12-22,"Background:
      
    

    
      GGAs (Golgi-localised, Î³-ear containing, ADP ribosylation factor-binding) are a family of clathrin adaptors that sort a number of biologically important transmembrane proteins into clathrin-coated vesicles. Knockout and knockdown studies to determine GGA function are confounded by the fact that there are 3 GGA genes in mammalian cells. Thus Drosophila melanogaster is a useful model system to study tissue expression profiles and knockdown phenotypes as there is a single GGA ortholog.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here we have quantified protein expression in Drosophila and show that there is >3-fold higher expression of GGA in male flies relative to female flies. In female flies the majority of GGA expression is in the head. In male flies GGA is not only expressed at high levels in the head but there is a gender specific increased expression which is due to the abundant expression of GGA in the testes. Using a highly specific antibody we have localised endogenous GGA protein in testes squashes, and visualised it in somatic and germ line cells. We show that GGA is expressed during multiple stages of sperm development, and co-stains with a marker of the trans-Golgi Network. This is most striking at the acroblast of early spermatids. In spite of the high expression of GGA in testes, knocking down its expression by >95% using transgenic RNAi fly lines did not affect male fertility. Therefore spermatogenesis in the male flies appears to progress normally with <5% GGA, most likely because alternative adaptors may be able to substitute partially or completely for the function of GGA. We also identify 'cueball' as a novel cargo for GGA, and mutants of cueball have been shown to have a male sterility phenotype.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      In Drosophila we have uncovered a potential role for GGA in the testes of male flies. The gender specific higher expression of GGA, its specific enrichment in testes and its localisation to developing spermatocytes and at the acroblast of spermatids supports a role for GGA function in Drosophila spermatogenesis, even though spermatogenesis still occurs when GGA expression is depleted to <5% of control.",2011,"Jennifer Hirst, Jenny Carmichael, Jennifer Hirst, Jenny Carmichael"
Positional cloning of silkworm white egg 2 (w-2) locus shows functional conservation and diversification of ABC transporters for pigmentation in insects,21294818,10.1111/j.1365-2443.2011.01490.x,"The white, scarlet and brown genes of Drosophila melanogaster encode three half-type ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. In Drosophila, precursors of ommochromes and pteridines are transported by White/Scarlet and White/Brown heterodimers, respectively. The white egg 2 (w-2) mutant of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, has white eggs and eyes because of lack of ommochrome granules in the serosa and eyes. Here, we report that the silkworm w-2 locus encodes an ortholog of Drosophila scarlet. Our results indicate that Bombyx Scarlet forms a heterodimer with Bombyx White to transport ommochrome precursors, suggesting that formation of a White/Scarlet heterodimer and its involvement in the transport of ommochrome precursors are evolutionarily ancient and widely conserved traits in insects. Contrary to dipteran insects, white and scarlet were juxtaposed in a head-to-tail orientation in the silkworm genome, suggesting that the origin of white and scarlet was a tandem duplication of their ancestral transporter gene. In Bombyx, White is also essential for the transport of uric acid in larval epidermis. However, our results suggest that a Bombyx White/Scarlet heterodimer is not involved in this process. Our results emphasize the functional conservation and diversification of half-type ABC transporter families in insects, which may contribute to their extremely diverse color patterns.",2011,"Ken-ichiro Tatematsu, Kimiko Yamamoto, Keiro Uchino, Junko Narukawa, Tetsuya Iizuka, Yutaka Banno, Susumu Katsuma, Toru Shimada, Toshiki Tamura, Hideki Sezutsu, Takaaki Daimon, Ken-ichiro Tatematsu, Kimiko Yamamoto, Keiro Uchino, Junko Narukawa, Tetsuya Iizuka, Yutaka Banno, Susumu Katsuma, Toru Shimada, Toshiki Tamura, Hideki Sezutsu, Takaaki Daimon"
Quantifying the life-history response to increased male exposure in female Drosophila melanogaster,21044054,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01151.x,"Precise estimates of costs and benefits, the fitness economics, of mating are of key importance in understanding how selection shapes the coevolution of male and female mating traits. However, fitness is difficult to define and quantify. Here, we used a novel application of an established analytical technique to calculate individual- and population-based estimates of fitness-including those sensitive to the timing of reproduction-to measure the effects on females of increased exposure to males. Drosophila melanogaster females were exposed to high and low frequencies of contact with males, and life-history traits for each individual female were recorded. We then compared different fitness estimates to determine which of them best described the changes in life histories. We predicted that rate-sensitive estimates would be more accurate, as mating influences the rate of offspring production in this species. The results supported this prediction. Increased exposure to males led to significantly decreased fitness within declining but not stable or increasing populations. There was a net benefit of increased male exposure in expanding populations, despite a significant decrease in lifespan. The study shows how a more accurate description of fitness, and new insights can be achieved by considering individual life-history strategies within the context of population growth.",2011,"Dominic A Edward, Claudia Fricke, Dave T Gerrard, Tracey Chapman, Dominic A Edward, Claudia Fricke, Dave T Gerrard, Tracey Chapman"

Here we have used PCR and Southern blots to screen for sequences similar to copia element in South American populations of D. willistoni, as well as in strains previously shown to be carriers of the element. We have not found the canonical copia element in any of these populations. Unlike the P element, which invaded the D. melanogaster genome from D. willistoni and quickly spread worldwide, the canonical copia element appears to have transferred in the opposite direction and has not spread.

A PAR-1-dependent orientation gradient of dynamic microtubules directs posterior cargo transport in the Drosophila oocyte,21746854,10.1083/jcb.201103160,"Cytoskeletal organization is central to establishing cell polarity in various cellular contexts, including during messenger ribonucleic acid sorting in Drosophila melanogaster oocytes by microtubule (MT)-dependent molecular motors. However, MT organization and dynamics remain controversial in the oocyte. In this paper, we use rapid multichannel live-cell imaging with novel image analysis, tracking, and visualization tools to characterize MT polarity and dynamics while imaging posterior cargo transport. We found that all MTs in the oocyte were highly dynamic and were organized with a biased random polarity that increased toward the posterior. This organization originated through MT nucleation at the oocyte nucleus and cortex, except at the posterior end of the oocyte, where PAR-1 suppressed nucleation.

The role of IAP antagonist proteins in the core apoptosis pathway of the mosquito disease vector Aedes aegypti,21274634,10.1007/s10495-011-0575-3,"While apoptosis regulation has been studied extensively in Drosophila melanogaster, similar studies in other insects, including disease vectors, lag far behind. In D. melanogaster, the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein DIAP1 is the major negative regulator of caspases, while IAP antagonists induce apoptosis, in part, by binding to DIAP1 and inhibiting its ability to regulate caspases. In this study, we characterized the roles of two IAP antagonists, Michelob_x (Mx) and IMP, in apoptosis in the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti. Overexpression of Mx or IMP caused apoptosis in A. aegypti Aag2 cells, while silencing expression of mx or imp attenuated apoptosis. Addition of recombinant Mx or IMP, but not cytochrome c, to Aag2 cytosolic extract caused caspase activation. Consistent with this finding, AeIAP1 bound and inhibited both initiator and effector caspases from A. aegypti, and Mx and IMP competed with caspases for binding to AeIAP1. However, a difference was observed in the BIR domains responsible for Dronc binding by AeIAP1 versus DIAP1. These findings demonstrate that the mechanisms by which IAP antagonists regulate apoptosis are largely conserved between A. aegypti and D. melanogaster, although subtle differences exist.",2011,"Hua Wang, Rollie J Clem, Hua Wang, Rollie J Clem"
Hundreds of putatively functional small open reading frames in Drosophila,22118156,10.1186/gb-2011-12-11-r118,"Background:
      
    

    
      The relationship between DNA sequence and encoded information is still an unsolved puzzle. The number of protein-coding genes in higher eukaryotes identified by genome projects is lower than was expected, while a considerable amount of putatively non-coding transcription has been detected. Functional small open reading frames (smORFs) are known to exist in several organisms. However, coding sequence detection methods are biased against detecting such very short open reading frames. Thus, a substantial number of non-canonical coding regions encoding short peptides might await characterization.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Using bio-informatics methods, we have searched for smORFs of less than 100 amino acids in the putatively non-coding euchromatic DNA of Drosophila melanogaster, and initially identified nearly 600,000 of them. We have studied the pattern of conservation of these smORFs as coding entities between D. melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura, their presence in syntenic and in transcribed regions of the genome, and their ratio of conservative versus non-conservative nucleotide changes. For negative controls, we compared the results with those obtained using random short sequences, while a positive control was provided by smORFs validated by proteomics data.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:

Developmental stability: a major role for cyclin G in drosophila melanogaster,21998598,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002314,"Morphological consistency in metazoans is remarkable given the pervasive occurrence of genetic variation, environmental effects, and developmental noise. Developmental stability, the ability to reduce developmental noise, is a fundamental property of multicellular organisms, yet its genetic bases remains elusive. Imperfect bilateral symmetry, or fluctuating asymmetry, is commonly used to estimate developmental stability. We observed that Drosophila melanogaster overexpressing Cyclin G (CycG) exhibit wing asymmetry clearly detectable by sight. Quantification of wing size and shape using geometric morphometrics reveals that this asymmetry is a genuine-but extreme-fluctuating asymmetry. Overexpression of CycG indeed leads to a 40-fold increase of wing fluctuating asymmetry, which is an unprecedented effect, for any organ and in any animal model, either in wild populations or mutants. This asymmetry effect is not restricted to wings, since femur length is affected as well. Inactivating CycG by RNAi also induces fluctuating asymmetry but to a lesser extent. Investigating the cellular bases of the phenotypic effects of CycG deregulation, we found that misregulation of cell size is predominant in asymmetric flies. In particular, the tight negative correlation between cell size and cell number observed in wild-type flies is impaired when CycG is upregulated. Our results highlight the role of CycG in the control of developmental stability in D. melanogaster. Furthermore, they show that wing developmental stability is normally ensured via compensatory processes between cell growth and cell proliferation. We discuss the possible role of CycG as a hub in a genetic network that controls developmental stability.",2011,"Vincent Debat, SÃ©bastien Bloyer, Floria Faradji, Nelly Gidaszewski, Nicolas Navarro, Pablo Orozco-Terwengel, ValÃ©rie Ribeiro, Christian SchlÃ¶tterer, Jean S Deutsch, FrÃ©dÃ©rique Peronnet, Vincent Debat, SÃ©bastien Bloyer, Floria Faradji, Nelly Gidaszewski, Nicolas Navarro, Pablo Orozco-Terwengel, ValÃ©rie Ribeiro, Christian SchlÃ¶tterer, Jean S Deutsch, FrÃ©dÃ©rique Peronnet"
Evidence for differential biosynthesis of juvenile hormone (and related) sesquiterpenoids in Drosophila melanogaster,21354154,10.1016/j.ygcen.2011.02.014,"Previous studies in Drosophila melanogaster have demonstrated that biosynthesis and regulation of juvenile hormone bisepoxide (JHB(3)) may not be coordinated with that of juvenile hormone (JH III). In this study, we have used the radiochemical assay to confirm the coordinated developmental sesquiterpenoid profile during adult life and analyze the effect of farnesol and farnesoic acid addition on methyl farnesoate, JH III and JHB(3) production by isolated ring glands of Drosophila third instar larvae or corpora allata of adult females. Application of exogenous farnesol or farnesoic acid to glands in vitro stimulated MF and JH III biosynthesis in both larvae and adults. Farnesol and farnesoic acid were inhibitory to JHB(3) biosynthesis in larvae. N-acetyl-geranyl-L-cysteine (NAGC) and S-farnesyl-thioacetic acid (SFTA) are farnesyl pyrophosphatase inhibitors that have specificity towards two different ring gland phosphatases. NAGC and SFTA had no effect on MF or JH III biosynthesis, whereas SFTA inhibited JHB(3) biosynthesis. SFTA shows specificity for a ring gland phosphatase, Phos2680, which has not been previously implicated as a contributor to JHB(3) biosynthesis. This finding suggests that farnesol production occurs in two alternate pools; one pool utilized for MF and JH III production and the other for JHB(3) production. Finally, we have used the UAS-GAL4 system in Drosophila to express juvenile hormone acid methyltransferase (JHAMT) in vivo. In contrast to in vitro studies, JHAMT expression had no effect on MF or JH III biosynthesis but stimulated JHB(3) in both larvae and adults.",2011,"William G Bendena, Jinrui Zhang, Sally M Burtenshaw, Stephen S Tobe, William G Bendena, Jinrui Zhang, Sally M Burtenshaw, Stephen S Tobe"

Although some critics of this approach have argued that it has not generated many novel insights, we would argue that fly models of human neurodegenerative disorders have provided valuable information when viewed within the context of other models and systems of analysis.

Acute and chronic metal exposure impairs locomotion activity in Drosophila melanogaster: a model to study Parkinsonism,21594680,10.1007/s10534-011-9463-0,"The biometals iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and copper (Cu) have been associated to Parkinson's disease (PD) and Parkinsonism. In this work, we report for the first time that acute (15 mM for up to 5 days) or chronic (0.5 mM for up to 15 days) Fe, Mn and Cu exposure significantly reduced life span and locomotor activity (i.e. climbing capabilities) in Drosophila melanogaster. It is shown that the concentration of those biometals dramatically increase in Drosophila's brain acutely or chronically fed with metal. We demonstrate that the metal accumulation in the fly's head is associated with the neurodegeneration of several dopaminergic neuronal clusters. Interestingly, it is found that the PPL2ab DAergic neuronal cluster was erode by the three metals in acute and chronic metal exposure and the PPL3 DAergic cluster was also erode by the three metals but in acute metal exposure only. Furthermore, we found that the chelator desferoxamine, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and D: -penicillamine were able to protect but not rescue D. melanogaster against metal intoxication. Taken together these data suggest that iron, manganese and copper are capable to destroy DAergic neurons in the fly's brain, thereby impairing their movement capabilities. This work provides for the first time metal-induced Parkinson-like symptoms in D. melanogaster. Understanding therefore the effects of biometals in the Drosophila model may provide insights into the toxic effect of metal ions and more effective therapeutic approaches to Parkinsonism.",2011,"Leonardo Bonilla-Ramirez, Marlene Jimenez-Del-Rio, Carlos Velez-Pardo, Leonardo Bonilla-Ramirez, Marlene Jimenez-Del-Rio, Carlos Velez-Pardo"

DNA sequence requirements for hobo transposable element transposition in Drosophila melanogaster,21805320,10.1007/s10709-011-9600-2,"We have conducted a structure and functional analysis of the hobo transposable element of Drosophila melanogaster. A minimum of 141 bp of the left (L) end and 65 bp of the right (R) end of the hobo were shown to contain sequences sufficient for transposition. Both ends of hobo contain multiple copies of the motifs GGGTG and GTGGC and we show that the frequency of hobo transposition increases as a function of the copy number of these motifs. The R end of hobo contains a unique 12 bp internal inverted repeat that is identical to the hobo terminal inverted repeats. We show that this internal inverted repeat suppresses transposition activity in a hobo element containing an intact L end and only 475 bp of the R end. In addition to establishing cis-sequences requirements for transposition, we analyzed trans-sequence effects of the hobo transposase. We show a hobo transposase lacking the first 49 amino acids catalyzed hobo transposition at a higher frequency than the full-length transposase suggesting that, similar to the related Ac transposase, residues at the amino end of the transposase reduce transposition.

The Capicua repressor--a general sensor of RTK signaling in development and disease,22526417,10.1242/jcs.092965,"Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways control multiple cellular decisions in metazoans, often by regulating the expression of downstream genes. In Drosophila melanogaster and other systems, E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors are considered to be the predominant nuclear effectors of RTK pathways. Here, we highlight recent progress in identifying the HMG-box protein Capicua (CIC) as a key sensor of RTK signaling in both Drosophila and mammals. Several studies have shown that CIC functions as a repressor of RTK-responsive genes, keeping them silent in the absence of signaling. Following the activation of RTK signaling, CIC repression is relieved, and this allows the expression of the targeted gene in response to local or ubiquitous activators. This regulatory switch is essential for several RTK responses in Drosophila, from the determination of cell fate to cell proliferation. Furthermore, increasing evidence supports the notion that this mechanism is conserved in mammals, where CIC has been implicated in cancer and neurodegeneration. In addition to summarizing our current knowledge on CIC, we also discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of RTK signaling specificity in different biological processes.",2012,"Gerardo JimÃ©nez, Stanislav Y Shvartsman, Ze'ev Paroush, Gerardo JimÃ©nez, Stanislav Y Shvartsman, Ze'ev Paroush"

Overexpression of Rheb in either the mushroom bodies or the insulin producing cells resulted in enlarged axon projections and cell bodies, which continued to increase in size with prolonged Rheb expression as the animals aged. Additionally, Rheb overexpression in the mushroom bodies resulted in deficiencies in 3 hr but not immediate appetitive memory.

In addition, attraction to tethered larvae still occurs across a clear plastic barrier, does not occur significantly in the dark and attraction occurs to a computer screen movie of larval motion. By altering the artificial attractant movie, we conclude that visual recognition involves both spatial and temporal components. Our results demonstrate that a simple but experimentally tractable visual system can distinguish complex images and that processing in the relatively large central brain may compensate for the simple input.",2012,"Elizabeth Daubert Justice, Nicholas James Macedonia, Catherine Hamilton, Barry Condron, Elizabeth Daubert Justice, Nicholas James Macedonia, Catherine Hamilton, Barry Condron"

In interphase, it promotes microtubule catastrophe; in mitosis, it contributes to anaphase chromosome movement by enabling tubulin flux. Here we show that Klp10A also acts as a microtubule depolymerase on centriolar microtubules to regulate centriole length. Thus, in both cultured cell lines and the testes, absence of Klp10A leads to longer centrioles that show incomplete 9-fold symmetry at their ends. These structures and associated pericentriolar material undergo fragmentation. We also show that in contrast to mammalian cells where depletion of CP110 leads to centriole elongation, in Drosophila cells it results in centriole length diminution that is overcome by codepletion of Klp10A to give longer centrioles than usual. We discuss how loss of centriole capping by CP110 might have different consequences for centriole length in mammalian and insect cells and also relate these findings to the functional interactions between mammalian CP110 and another kinesin-13, Kif24, that in mammalian cells regulates cilium formation.",2012,"Nathalie Delgehyr, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Rangone, Jingyan Fu, Guojie Mao, Brian Tom, Maria Giovanna Riparbelli, Giuliano Callaini, David M Glover, Nathalie Delgehyr, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Rangone, Jingyan Fu, Guojie Mao, Brian Tom, Maria Giovanna Riparbelli, Giuliano Callaini, David M Glover"

"Drosophila rugose is a functional homolog of mammalian Neurobeachin and affects synaptic architecture, brain morphology, and associative learning",23100440,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6424-11.2012,"Neurobeachin (Nbea) is implicated in vesicle trafficking in the regulatory secretory pathway, but details on its molecular function are currently unknown. We have used Drosophila melanogaster mutants for rugose (rg), the Drosophila homolog of Nbea, to further elucidate the function of this multidomain protein. Rg is expressed in a granular pattern reminiscent of the Golgi network in neuronal cell bodies and colocalizes with transgenic Nbea, suggesting a function in secretory regulation. In contrast to Nbea(-/-) mice, rg null mutants are viable and fertile and exhibit aberrant associative odor learning, changes in gross brain morphology, and synaptic architecture as determined at the larval neuromuscular junction. At the same time, basal synaptic transmission is essentially unaffected, suggesting that structural and functional aspects are separable. Rg phenotypes can be rescued by a Drosophila rg+ transgene, whereas a mouse Nbea transgene rescues aversive odor learning and synaptic architecture; it fails to rescue brain morphology and appetitive odor learning. This dissociation between the functional redundancy of either the mouse or the fly transgene suggests that their complex composition of numerous functional and highly conserved domains support independent functions. We propose that the detailed compendium of phenotypes exhibited by the Drosophila rg null mutant provided here will serve as a test bed for dissecting the different functional domains of BEACH (for beige and human Chediak-Higashi syndrome) proteins, such as Rugose, mouse Nbea, or Nbea orthologs in other species, such as human.",2012,"Karolien Volders, Sabrina Scholz, Jan R Slabbaert, Anja C Nagel, Patrik Verstreken, John W M Creemers, Patrick Callaerts, Martin SchwÃ¤rzel, Karolien Volders, Sabrina Scholz, Jan R Slabbaert, Anja C Nagel, Patrik Verstreken, John W M Creemers, Patrick Callaerts, Martin SchwÃ¤rzel"
Conserved properties of Drosophila and human spermatozoal mRNA repertoires,22378807,10.1098/rspb.2012.0153,"It is now well established that mature mammalian spermatozoa carry a population of mRNA molecules, at least some of which are transferred to the oocyte at fertilization, however, their function remains largely unclear. To shed light on the evolutionary conservation of this feature of sperm biology, we analysed highly purified populations of mature sperm from the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster. As with mammalian sperm, we found a consistently enriched population of mRNA molecules that are unlikely to be derived from contaminating somatic cells or immature sperm. Using tagged transcripts for three of the spermatozoal mRNAs, we demonstrate that they are transferred to the oocyte at fertilization and can be detected before, and at least until, the onset of zygotic gene expression. We find a remarkable conservation in the functional annotations associated with fly and human spermatozoal mRNAs, in particular, a highly significant enrichment for transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs). The substantial functional coherence of spermatozoal transcripts in humans and the fly opens the possibility of using the power of Drosophila genetics to address the function of this enigmatic class of molecules in sperm and in the oocyte following fertilization.",2012,"Bettina E Fischer, Elizabeth Wasbrough, Lisa A Meadows, Owen Randlet, Steve Dorus, Timothy L Karr, Steven Russell, Bettina E Fischer, Elizabeth Wasbrough, Lisa A Meadows, Owen Randlet, Steve Dorus, Timothy L Karr, Steven Russell"
The potential toxic effects of cerium on organism: cerium prolonged the developmental time and induced the expression of Hsp70 and apoptosis in Drosophila melanogaster,22707041,10.1007/s10646-012-0960-x,"Due to the widespread application of cerium, a rare earth element, the risk of exposure to cerium has increased. Therefore, understanding the physiological effects of cerium is of great importance. Our previous work showed that cerium caused significant lifespan shortening accompanied by oxidative damage in Drosophila melanogaster, however, little is known about the detailed mechanism of cerium-induced cytotoxicity. Thus, we examined the developmental time during metamorphosis, and assessed the toxic effects of cerium by evaluating heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), DNA damage markers and apoptosis in D. melanogaster. We found that cerium extended the developmental time of D. melanogaster and up-regulated the expression of Hsp70 when the concentration of cerium was increased (especially concentrations over 26.3 Î¼g/g). Up-regulation of the cell cycle checkpoint p53 and cell signaling protein p38 were also observed when the concentration of cerium was over 104 Î¼g/g. In addition, the activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9, markers of apoptosis, were significantly higher when the larvae were exposed to ceric sulfate. These results suggest that high concentrations of cerium may result in DNA damage and ultimately apoptosis in D. melanogaster, and strongly indicate that cerium should be applied with caution and the potential toxic effects in humans should also be taken into consideration.",2012,"Bin Wu, Di Zhang, Dan Wang, Chunyan Qi, Zongyun Li"
A Whole-Chromosome Analysis of Meiotic Recombination in Drosophila melanogaster,22384403,10.1534/g3.111.001396,"Although traditional genetic assays have characterized the pattern of crossing over across the genome in Drosophila melanogaster, these assays could not precisely define the location of crossovers. Even less is known about the frequency and distribution of noncrossover gene conversion events. To assess the specific number and positions of both meiotic gene conversion and crossover events, we sequenced the genomes of male progeny from females heterozygous for 93,538 X chromosomal single-nucleotide and InDel polymorphisms. From the analysis of the 30 F1 hemizygous X chromosomes, we detected 15 crossover and 5 noncrossover gene conversion events. Taking into account the nonuniform distribution of polymorphism along the chromosome arm, we estimate that most oocytes experience 1 crossover event and 1.6 gene conversion events per X chromosome pair per meiosis. An extrapolation to the entire genome would predict approximately 5 crossover events and 8.6 conversion events per meiosis. Mean gene conversion tract lengths were estimated to be 476 base pairs, yielding a per nucleotide conversion rate of 0.86 ? 10(-5) per meiosis. Both of these values are consistent with estimates of conversion frequency and tract length obtained from studies of rosy, the only gene for which gene conversion has been studied extensively in Drosophila. Motif-enrichment analysis revealed a GTGGAAA motif that was enriched near crossovers but not near gene conversions. The low-complexity and frequent occurrence of this motif may in part explain why, in contrast to mammalian systems, no meiotic crossover hotspots have been found in Drosophila.",2012,"Danny E Miller, Satomi Takeo, Kavyasree Nandanan, Ariel Paulson, Madelaine M Gogol, Aaron C Noll, Anoja G Perera, Kendra N Walton, William D Gilliland, Hua Li, Karen K Staehling, Justin P Blumenstiel, R Scott Hawley, Danny E Miller, Satomi Takeo, Kavyasree Nandanan, Ariel Paulson, Madelaine M Gogol, Aaron C Noll, Anoja G Perera, Kendra N Walton, William D Gilliland, Hua Li, Karen K Staehling, Justin P Blumenstiel, R Scott Hawley"

What reaches the antenna? How to calibrate odor flux and ligand-receptor affinities,22362868,10.1093/chemse/bjs009,"Physiological studies on olfaction frequently ignore the airborne quantities of stimuli reaching the sensory organ. We used a gas chromatography-calibrated photoionization detector to estimate quantities released from standard Pasteur pipette stimulus cartridges during repeated puffing of 27 compounds and verified how lack of quantification could obscure olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) affinities. Chemical structure of the stimulus, solvent, dose, storage condition, puff interval, and puff number all influenced airborne quantities. A model including boiling point and lipophilicity, but excluding vapor pressure, predicted airborne quantities from stimuli in paraffin oil on filter paper. We recorded OSN responses of Drosophila melanogaster, Ips typographus, and Culex quinquefasciatus, to known quantities of airborne stimuli. These demonstrate that inferred OSN tuning width, ligand affinity, and classification can be confounded and require stimulus quantification. Additionally, proper dose-response analysis shows that Drosophila AB3A OSNs are not promiscuous, but highly specific for ethyl hexanoate, with other earlier proposed ligands 10- to 10 000-fold less potent. Finally, we reanalyzed published Drosophila OSN data (DoOR) and demonstrate substantial shifts in affinities after compensation for quantity and puff number.

Bypassing the Greatwall-Endosulfine pathway: plasticity of a pivotal cell-cycle regulatory module in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans,22649080,10.1534/genetics.112.140574,"In vertebrates, mitotic and meiotic M phase is facilitated by the kinase Greatwall (Gwl), which phosphorylates a conserved sequence in the effector Endosulfine (Endos). Phosphorylated Endos inactivates the phosphatase PP2A/B55 to stabilize M-phase-specific phosphorylations added to many proteins by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). We show here that this module functions essentially identically in Drosophila melanogaster and is necessary for proper mitotic and meiotic cell division in a wide variety of tissues. Despite the importance and evolutionary conservation of this pathway between insects and vertebrates, it can be bypassed in at least two situations. First, heterozygosity for loss-of-function mutations of twins, which encodes the Drosophila B55 protein, suppresses the effects of endos or gwl mutations. Several types of cell division occur normally in twins heterozygotes in the complete absence of Endos or the near absence of Gwl. Second, this module is nonessential in the nematode Caenorhaditis elegans. The worm genome does not contain an obvious ortholog of gwl, although it encodes a single Endos protein with a surprisingly well-conserved Gwl target site. Deletion of this site from worm Endos has no obvious effects on cell divisions involved in viability or reproduction under normal laboratory conditions. In contrast to these situations, removal of one copy of twins does not completely bypass the requirement for endos or gwl for Drosophila female fertility, although reducing twins dosage reverses the meiotic maturation defects of hypomorphic gwl mutants.

Female Drosophila melanogaster suffer reduced defense against infection due to seminal fluid components,22698822,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2012.06.002,"Reduced defense against infection is commonly observed as a consequence of reproductive activity, but little is known about how post-mating immunosuppression occurs. In this work, we use Drosophila melanogaster as a model to test the role of seminal fluid components and egg production in suppressing post-mating immune defense. We also evaluate whether systemic immune system activity is altered during infection in mated females. We find that post-mating reduction in female defense depends critically on male transfer of sperm and seminal fluid proteins, including the accessory gland protein known as ""sex peptide."" However, the effect of these male factors is dependent on the presence of the female germline. We find that mated females have lower antimicrobial peptide gene expression than virgin females in response to systemic infection, and that this lower expression correlates with higher systemic bacterial loads. We conclude that, upon receipt of sperm and seminal fluid proteins, females experience a germline-dependent physiological shift that directly or indirectly reduces their overall ability to defend against infection, at least in part through alteration of humoral immune system activity.",2012,"Sarah M Short, Mariana F Wolfner, Brian P Lazzaro, Sarah M Short, Mariana F Wolfner, Brian P Lazzaro"
Two clocks in the brain: an update of the morning and evening oscillator model in Drosophila,22877659,10.1016/B978-0-444-59427-3.00027-7,"Circadian clocks play an essential role in adapting the activity rhythms of animals to the day-night cycles on earth throughout the four seasons. In many animals, including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, two separate but mutually coupled clocks in the brain -morning (M) and evening (E) oscillators- control the activity in the morning and evening. M and E oscillators are thought to track dawn and dusk, respectively. This alters the phase-angle between the two oscillators under different day lengths, optimally adapting the animal's activity pattern to colder short and warmer long days. Using excellent genetic tools, Drosophila researchers have addressed the neural basis of the two oscillators and could partially track these to distinct clock cells in the brain. Nevertheless, not all data are consistent with each other and many questions remained open. So far, most studies about M and E oscillators focused on the influence of light (photoperiod). Here, we will review the effects of light and temperature on the two oscillators, will update the present knowledge, discuss the limitations of the model, and raise questions that have to be addressed in the future.",2012,"Taishi Yoshii, Dirk Rieger, Charlotte Helfrich-FÃ¶rster, Taishi Yoshii, Dirk Rieger, Charlotte Helfrich-FÃ¶rster"

Using this strategy, we have defined a subset of seven Drosophila miRNAs that are likely to participate in the immune response.

Evolution of BMP signaling in Drosophila oogenesis: a receptor-based mechanism,22768927,10.1016/j.bpj.2012.03.026,"The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway is a conserved regulator of cellular and developmental processes in animals. The mechanisms underlying BMP signaling activation differ among tissues and mostly reflect changes in the expression of pathway components. BMP signaling is one of the major pathways responsible for the patterning of the Drosophila eggshell, a complex structure derived from a layer of follicle cells (FCs) surrounding the developing oocyte. Activation of BMP signaling in the FCs is dynamic. Initially, signaling is along the anterior-posterior (A/P) axis; later, signaling acquires dorsal-ventral (D/V) polarity. These dynamics are regulated by changes in the expression pattern of the type I BMP receptor thickveins (tkv). We recently found that signaling dynamics and TKV patterning are highly correlated in the FCs of multiple Drosophila species. In addition, we showed that signaling patterns are spatially different among species. Here, we use a mathematical model to simulate the dynamics and differences of BMP signaling in numerous species. This model predicts that qualitative and quantitative changes in receptor expression can lead to differences in the spatial pattern of BMP signaling. We tested these predications experimentally in three different Drosophila species and through genetic perturbations of BMP signaling in D. melanogaster. On the basis of our results, we concluded that changes in tkv patterning can account for the experimentally observed differences in the patterns of BMP signaling in multiple Drosophila species.",2012,"Matthew G Niepielko, Kuhn Ip, Jitendra S Kanodia, Desmond S Lun, Nir Yakoby, Matthew G Niepielko, Kuhn Ip, Jitendra S Kanodia, Desmond S Lun, Nir Yakoby"

The unbalance is striking between the abundant literature on nAChR sensitivity to insecticides and the rarity of information regarding their molecular properties and cognitive functions. The recent advent of genome sequencing disclosed that nAChR gene families of insects are rather small-sized compared to vertebrates. Behavioral experiments performed in the honeybee demonstrated that a subpopulation of nAChRs sensitive to the venom Î±-bungarotoxin and permeant to calcium is necessary for the formation of long-term memory. Concomitant data in Drosophila reported that repetitive exposure to nicotine results in a calcium-dependent plasticity of the nAChR-mediated response involving cAMP signaling cascades and indicated that ACh-induced Ca++ currents are modulated by monoamines involved in aversive and appetitive learning.

Keeping pace with climate change: what is wrong with the evolutionary potential of upper thermal limits?,23170220,10.1002/ece3.385,"The potential of populations to evolve in response to ongoing climate change is partly conditioned by the presence of heritable genetic variation in relevant physiological traits. Recent research suggests that Drosophila melanogaster exhibits negligible heritability, hence little evolutionary potential in heat tolerance when measured under slow heating rates that presumably mimic conditions in nature. Here, we study the effects of directional selection for increased heat tolerance using Drosophila as a model system. We combine a physiological model to simulate thermal tolerance assays with multilocus models for quantitative traits. Our simulations show that, whereas the evolutionary response of the genetically determined upper thermal limit (CTmax) is independent of methodological context, the response in knockdown temperatures varies with measurement protocol and is substantially (up to 50%) lower than for CTmax. Realized heritabilities of knockdown temperature may grossly underestimate the true heritability of CTmax. For instance, assuming that the true heritability of CTmax in the base population is h(2) = 0.25, realized heritabilities of knockdown temperature are around 0.08-0.16 depending on heating rate. These effects are higher in slow heating assays, suggesting that flawed methodology might explain the apparently limited evolutionary potential of cosmopolitan D. melanogaster.",2012,"Mauro Santos, Luis E CastaÃ±eda, Enrico L Rezende, Mauro Santos, Luis E CastaÃ±eda, Enrico L Rezende"
Ultrabithorax confers spatial identity in a context-specific manner in the Drosophila postembryonic ventral nervous system,22967828,10.1186/1749-8104-7-31,"Background:
      
    

    
      In holometabolous insects such as Drosophila melanogaster, neuroblasts produce an initial population of diverse neurons during embryogenesis and a much larger set of adult-specific neurons during larval life. In the ventral CNS, many of these secondary neuronal lineages differ significantly from one body segment to another, suggesting a role for anteroposterior patterning genes.

      Here we systematically characterize the expression pattern and function of the Hox gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) in all 25 postembryonic lineages. We find that Ubx is expressed in a segment-, lineage-, and hemilineage-specific manner in the thoracic and anterior abdominal segments. When Ubx is removed from neuroblasts via mitotic recombination, neurons in these segments exhibit the morphologies and survival patterns of their anterior thoracic counterparts. Conversely, when Ubx is ectopically expressed in anterior thoracic segments, neurons exhibit complementary posterior transformation phenotypes.

      Our findings demonstrate that Ubx plays a critical role in conferring segment-appropriate morphology and survival on individual neurons in the adult-specific ventral CNS.

Phenotypic plasticity in response to dietary salt stress: Na+ and K+ transport by the gut of Drosophila melanogaster larvae,22246255,10.1242/jeb.064048,"Drosophila provides a useful model system for studies of the mechanisms involved in regulation of internal ion levels in response to variations in dietary salt load. This study assessed whether alterations in Na(+) and K(+) transport by the gut of larval D. melanogaster reared on salt-rich diets contribute to haemolymph ionoregulation. Na(+) and K(+) fluxes across the isolated guts of third instar larvae reared on control or salt-rich diets were measured using the scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET). K(+) absorption across the anterior portion of the posterior midgut of larvae reared on diet in which the concentration of KCl was increased 0.4 mol l(-1) above that in the control diet was reduced eightfold relative to the same gut segment of larvae reared on the control diet. There was also an increase in the magnitude and extent of K(+) secretion across the posterior half of the posterior midgut. Na(+) was absorbed across the ileum of larvae reared on the control diet, but was secreted across the ileum of larvae reared on diet in which the concentration of NaCl was increased 0.4 mol l(-1) above that in the control diet. There was also a small reduction in the extent of Na(+) absorption across the middle midgut of larvae reared on the NaCl-rich diet. The results indicate considerable phenotypic plasticity with respect to K(+) and Na(+) transport by the gut epithelia of larval D. melanogaster. SIET measurements of K(+) and Na(+) fluxes along the length of the gut show that ion transport mechanisms of the gut are reconfigured during salt stress so that there are reductions in K(+) and Na(+) absorption and increases in K(+) and Na(+) secretion. Together with previously described changes in salt secretion by the Malpighian tubules, these changes contribute to haemolymph ionoregulation.",2012,"Wida Naikkhwah, Michael J O'Donnell, Wida Naikkhwah, Michael J O'Donnell"

Multiscale diffusion in the mitotic Drosophila melanogaster syncytial blastoderm,22592793,10.1073/pnas.1204270109,"Despite the fundamental importance of diffusion for embryonic morphogen gradient formation in the early Drosophila melanogaster embryo, there remains controversy regarding both the extent and the rate of diffusion of well-characterized morphogens. Furthermore, the recent observation of diffusional ""compartmentalization"" has suggested that diffusion may in fact be nonideal and mediated by an as-yet-unidentified mechanism. Here, we characterize the effects of the geometry of the early syncytial Drosophila embryo on the effective diffusivity of cytoplasmic proteins. Our results demonstrate that the presence of transient mitotic membrane furrows results in a multiscale diffusion effect that has a significant impact on effective diffusion rates across the embryo. Using a combination of live-cell experiments and computational modeling, we characterize these effects and relate effective bulk diffusion rates to instantaneous diffusion coefficients throughout the syncytial blastoderm nuclear cycle phase of the early embryo. This multiscale effect may be related to the effect of interphase nuclei on effective diffusion, and thus we propose that an as-yet-unidentified role of syncytial membrane furrows is to temporally regulate bulk embryonic diffusion rates to balance the multiscale effect of interphase nuclei, which ultimately stabilizes the shapes of various morphogen gradients.",2012,"Brian R Daniels, Richa Rikhy, Malte Renz, Terrence M Dobrowsky, Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz, Brian R Daniels, Richa Rikhy, Malte Renz, Terrence M Dobrowsky, Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz"

        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      We have performed a genetic screen of a set of 505 Drosophila melanogaster gene trap insertion lines to identify novel genes expressed in the adult olfactory organs. We identified 16 lines with expression in the olfactory organs, many of which exhibited expression of the trapped genes in olfactory receptor neurons. Phenotypic analysis showed that six of the lines have decreased olfactory responses in a behavioural assay, and for one of these we showed that precise excision of the P element reverts the phenotype to wild type, confirming a role for the trapped gene in olfaction. To confirm the identity of the genes trapped in the lines we performed molecular analysis of some of the insertion sites. While for many lines the reported insertion sites were correct, we also demonstrated that for a number of lines the reported location of the element was incorrect, and in three lines there were in fact two pGT element insertions.
    

    
  


        Conclusions/significance:
      
    

    
      We identified 16 new genes expressed in the Drosophila olfactory organs, the majority in neurons, and for several of the gene trap lines demonstrated a defect in olfactory-driven behaviour. Further characterisation of these genes and their roles in olfactory system function and development will increase our understanding of how the insect olfactory system has evolved to perform the same essential function to that of mammals, but using very different molecular genetic mechanisms.",2012,"Narelle E Tunstall, Anabel Herr, Marien de Bruyne, Coral G Warr, Narelle E Tunstall, Anabel Herr, Marien de Bruyne, Coral G Warr"

[Functional interactions between promoters of neighboring yellow and CG3777 genes in Drosophila melanogaster],23516896,,"It was shown by us previously that the transcription of the yellow gene can be affected by the promoter of the neighboring gene CG3777, which has a similar expression profile. In the present work, we continued studying the functional interactions between the promoters of the yellow and CG3777 genes in transgenic Drosophila strains. In this work, we used the failure of the yeast activator GAL4 to stimulate transcription from the promoter of the yellow gene for the case when GAL4-binding sites are localized at the 3'-end of the gene. It has been found that, if the 983-bp CG3777 gene promoter is inserted in transgenic strains in the same orientation with the yellow gene promoter, downstream from the sites of the GAL4 activator, the CG3777 promoter provides a strong stimulation of the yellow gene by the GAL4 activator. When the promoters of the yellow and CG3777 genes are inserted in opposite orientations relative to one another, no stimulation of the yellow gene by GAL4 is observed. Additional results obtained in the work demonstrate that the functional interacton between the CG3777 and yellow promoters depends on their mutual orientation and position relative to the GAL4-binding sites.",2012,"D V Leman, A F Parshikov, P G Georgiev, O G Maksimenko, D V Leman, A F Parshikov, P G Georgiev, O G Maksimenko"
Functional evidence that a recently evolved Drosophila sperm-specific gene boosts sperm competition,22308475,10.1073/pnas.1121327109,"In many species, both morphological and molecular traits related to sex and reproduction evolve faster in males than in females. Ultimately, rapid male evolution relies on the acquisition of genetic variation associated with differential reproductive success. Many newly evolved genes are associated with novel functions that might enhance male fitness. However, functional evidence of the adaptive role of recently originated genes in males is still lacking. The Sperm dynein intermediate chain multigene family, which encodes a Sperm dynein intermediate chain presumably involved in sperm motility, originated from complex genetic rearrangements in the lineage that leads to Drosophila melanogaster within the last 5.4 million years since its split from Drosophila simulans. We deleted all the members of this multigene family resident on the X chromosome of D. melanogaster by chromosome engineering and found that, although the deletion does not result in a reduction of progeny number, it impairs the competence of the sperm in the presence of sperm from wild-type males. Therefore, the Sperm dynein intermediate chain multigene family contributes to the differential reproductive success among males and illustrates precisely how quickly a new gene function can be incorporated into the genetic network of a species.",2012,"Shu-Dan Yeh, Tiffanie Do, Carolus Chan, Adriana Cordova, Francisco Carranza, Eugene A Yamamoto, Mashya Abbassi, Kania A Gandasetiawan, Pablo Librado, Elisabetta Damia, Patrizio Dimitri, Julio Rozas, Daniel L Hartl, John Roote, JosÃ© M Ranz, Shu-Dan Yeh, Tiffanie Do, Carolus Chan, Adriana Cordova, Francisco Carranza, Eugene A Yamamoto, Mashya Abbassi, Kania A Gandasetiawan, Pablo Librado, Elisabetta Damia, Patrizio Dimitri, Julio Rozas, Daniel L Hartl, John Roote, JosÃ© M Ranz"

Three-dimensional morphology and gene expression mapping for the Drosophila blastoderm,22301653,10.1101/pdb.top067843,"To properly understand the transcriptional network of animals, we must have full quantitative comprehension of the spatial and temporal expression patterns of transcription factors and their targets.

Impact of the resident microbiota on the nutritional phenotype of Drosophila melanogaster,22586494,10.1371/journal.pone.0036765,"Background:
      
    

    
      Animals are chronically infected by benign and beneficial microorganisms that generally promote animal health through their effects on the nutrition, immune function and other physiological systems of the host. Insight into the host-microbial interactions can be obtained by comparing the traits of animals experimentally deprived of their microbiota and untreated animals. Drosophila melanogaster is an experimentally tractable system to study host-microbial interactions.
    

    
  


        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      The nutritional significance of the microbiota was investigated in D. melanogaster bearing unmanipulated microbiota, demonstrated by 454 sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons to be dominated by the Î±-proteobacterium Acetobacter, and experimentally deprived of the microbiota by egg dechorionation (conventional and axenic flies, respectively). In axenic flies, larval development rate was depressed with no effect on adult size relative to conventional flies, indicating that the microbiota promotes larval growth rates. Female fecundity did not differ significantly between conventional and axenic flies, but axenic flies had significantly reduced metabolic rate and altered carbohydrate allocation, including elevated glucose levels.
    

    
  


        Conclusions/significance:

A secreted MMP is required for reepithelialization during wound healing,22262460,10.1091/mbc.E11-09-0745,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are extracellular proteases highly expressed at wound sites. However, the precise function of MMPs during reepithelialization in vivo has been elusive in mammalian models because of the high level of redundancy among the 24 mammalian MMPs. For this reason we used Drosophila melanogaster, whose genome encodes only two MMPs-one secreted type (Mmp1) and one membrane-anchored type (Mmp2)-to study the function and regulation of the secreted class of MMPs in vivo. In the absence of redundancy, we found that the Drosophila secreted MMP, Mmp1, is required in the epidermis to facilitate reepithelialization by remodeling the basement membrane, promoting cell elongation and actin cytoskeletal reorganization, and activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling. In addition, we report that the jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway upregulates Mmp1 expression after wounding, but that Mmp1 is expressed independent of the JNK pathway in unwounded epidermis. When the JNK pathway is ectopically activated to overexpress Mmp1, the rate of healing is accelerated in an Mmp1-dependent manner. A primary function of Mmp1, under the control of the JNK pathway, is to promote basement membrane repair, which in turn may permit cell migration and the restoration of a continuous tissue.",2012,"Laura J Stevens, Andrea Page-McCaw, Laura J Stevens, Andrea Page-McCaw"
P-element homing is facilitated by engrailed polycomb-group response elements in Drosophila melanogaster,22276200,10.1371/journal.pone.0030437,"P-element vectors are commonly used to make transgenic Drosophila and generally insert in the genome in a nonselective manner. However, when specific fragments of regulatory DNA from a few Drosophila genes are incorporated into P-transposons, they cause the vectors to be inserted near the gene from which the DNA fragment was derived. This is called P-element homing. We mapped the minimal DNA fragment that could mediate homing to the engrailed/invected region of the genome. A 1.6 kb fragment of engrailed regulatory DNA that contains two Polycomb-group response elements (PREs) was sufficient for homing. We made flies that contain a 1.5 kb deletion of engrailed DNA (en(?1.5)) in situ, including the PREs and the majority of the fragment that mediates homing. Remarkably, homing still occurs onto the en(?1. 5) chromosome. In addition to homing to en, P[en] inserts near Polycomb group target genes at an increased frequency compared to P[EPgy2], a vector used to generate 18,214 insertions for the Drosophila gene disruption project. We suggest that homing is mediated by interactions between multiple proteins bound to the homing fragment and proteins bound to multiple areas of the engrailed/invected chromatin domain. Chromatin structure may also play a role in homing.",2012,"Yuzhong Cheng, Deborah Y Kwon, Allison L Arai, Diane Mucci, Judith A Kassis, Yuzhong Cheng, Deborah Y Kwon, Allison L Arai, Diane Mucci, Judith A Kassis"
Chromatin domain boundary element search tool for Drosophila,22287636,10.1093/nar/gks045,"Chromatin domain boundary elements prevent inappropriate interaction between distant or closely spaced regulatory elements and restrict enhancers and silencers to correct target promoters. In spite of having such a general role and expected frequent occurrence genome wide, there is no DNA sequence analysis based tool to identify boundary elements. Here, we report chromatin domain Boundary Element Search Tool (cdBEST), to identify boundary elements. cdBEST uses known recognition sequences of boundary interacting proteins and looks for 'motif clusters'. Using cdBEST, we identified boundary sequences across 12 Drosophila species. Of the 4576 boundary sequences identified in Drosophila melanogaster genome, >170 sequences are repetitive in nature and have sequence homology to transposable elements. Analysis of such sequences across 12 Drosophila genomes showed that the occurrence of repetitive sequences in the context of boundaries is a common feature of drosophilids. We use a variety of genome organization criteria and also experimental test on a subset of the cdBEST boundaries in an enhancer-blocking assay and show that 80% of them indeed function as boundaries in vivo. These observations highlight the role of cdBEST in better understanding of chromatin domain boundaries in Drosophila and setting the stage for comparative analysis of boundaries across closely related species.",2012,"Arumugam Srinivasan, Rakesh K Mishra, Arumugam Srinivasan, Rakesh K Mishra"

We implement a previously unused analysis that describes those directions with the greatest difference in evolvability between pairs of matrices. There are significant mutational effects on 19 of 21 possible aspects of wing form, consistent with the high dimensionality of standing genetic variation for wing shape previously identified in D. melanogaster. Mutations have partially recessive effects, consistent with average dominance around 0.25. Sex-specific matrices are relatively similar, although male-specific matrices are slightly larger, as expected due to dosage compensation on the X chromosome. Genotype-specific matrices are quite different. Matrices may differ both because of sampling error based on small samples of mutations with large phenotypic effects, and because of the mutational properties of the genotypes. Genotypic differences are likely to be involved, as the two genotypes have different molecular mutation rates and properties.",2013,"David Houle, Janna Fierst, David Houle, Janna Fierst"

However, a correlation between natural genetic variations in the developmental period and circadian rhythm has only been found in Bactrocera cucurbitae. The number of genetic factors that contribute to this genetic correlation is largely unclear. In this study, to examine whether natural genetic variations in the developmental period and circadian rhythm are correlated in Drosophila melanogaster, we performed an artificial disruptive selection on the developmental periods using wild-type strains and evaluated the circadian rhythms of the selected lines. To investigate whether multiple genetic factors mediate the genetic correlation, we reanalyzed previously published genome-wide deficiency screening data based on DrosDel isogenic deficiency strains and evaluated the effect of 438 genomic deficiencies on the developmental periods. We then randomly selected 32 genomic deficiencies with significant effects on the developmental periods and tested their effects on circadian rhythms. As a result, we found a significant response to selection for longer developmental periods and their correlated effects on circadian rhythms of the selected lines. We also found that 18 genomic regions had significant effects on the developmental periods and circadian rhythms, indicating their potential for mediating the genetic correlation between the developmental period and circadian rhythm. The novel findings of our study might lead to a better understanding of how this correlation is regulated genetically in broader taxonomic groups.",2013,"K H Takahashi, K Teramura, S Muraoka, Y Okada, T Miyatake, K H Takahashi, K Teramura, S Muraoka, Y Okada, T Miyatake"
piRNAs and epigenetic conversion in Drosophila,24088599,10.4161/fly.26522,"Transposable element (TE) activity is repressed in the Drosophila germline by Piwi-Interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs. These piRNAs are produced by discrete genomic loci containing TE fragments. In a recent publication, we tested for the existence of a strict epigenetic induction of piRNA production capacity by a locus in the D. melanogaster genome. We used 2 lines carrying a transgenic 7-copy tandem cluster (P-lacZ-white) at the same genomic site. This cluster generates in both lines a local heterochromatic sector. One line (T-1) produces high levels of ovarian piRNAs homologous to the P-lacZ-white transgenes and shows a strong capacity to repress homologous sequences in trans, whereas the other line (BX2) is devoid of both of these capacities. The properties of these 2 lines are perfectly stable over generations. We have shown that the maternal transmission of a cytoplasm carrying piRNAs from the first line can confer to the inert transgenic locus of the second, a totally de novo capacity to produce high levels of piRNAs as well as the ability to induce homology-dependent silencing in trans. These new properties are stably inherited over generations (n>50). Furthermore, the converted locus has itself become able to convert an inert transgenic locus via cytoplasmic maternal inheritance. This results in a stable epigenetic conversion process, which can be performed recurrently--a phenomenon termed paramutation and discovered in Maize 60 y ago. Paramutation in Drosophila corresponds to the first stable paramutation in animals and provides a model system to investigate the epigenetically induced emergence of a piRNA-producing locus, a crucial step in epigenome shaping.

The antiviral RNAi response in Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal candidate for providing a specific and acquired response to subsequent infection. We exposed D. melanogaster to two challenges of a virus known to produce an antiviral RNAi response, to examine whether any protective effects of prior exposure on survival were observed.

"The Drosophila wings apart gene anchors a novel, evolutionarily conserved pathway of neuromuscular development",24026097,10.1534/genetics.113.154211,"wings apart (wap) is a recessive, semilethal gene located on the X chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster, which is required for normal wing-vein patterning. We show that the wap mutation also results in loss of the adult jump muscle. We use complementation mapping and gene-specific RNA interference to localize the wap locus to the proximal X chromosome. We identify the annotated gene CG14614 as the gene affected by the wap mutation, since one wap allele contains a non-sense mutation in CG14614, and a genomic fragment containing only CG14614 rescues the jump-muscle phenotypes of two wap mutant alleles. The wap gene lies centromere-proximal to touch-insensitive larva B and centromere-distal to CG14619, which is tentatively assigned as the gene affected in introverted mutants. In mutant wap animals, founder cell precursors for the jump muscle are specified early in development, but are later lost. Through tissue-specific knockdowns, we demonstrate that wap function is required in both the musculature and the nervous system for normal jump-muscle formation. wap/CG14614 is homologous to vertebrate wdr68, DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 7, which also are expressed in neuromuscular tissues.

"Natural product of wild Zingiberaceae Elettariopsis slahmong: biopesticide to control the vector of banana blood disease bacterium in West Sumatera, Indonesia",25151825,,"Banana is one of the most important food crops in Indonesia. Its production is greater than any other agricultural commodity. With the population of 230 million in 2010, banana was consumed up to three million tons in this country. However, Banana Blood Disease Bacterium (BDB), one of the most devastating banana pathogens in the world, which is only found in Indonesia, threatens not only the growth of this plant but also the lives and the livelihoods for most of the Indonesian society. BDB is caused by a lethal bacteria, Ralstonia solanacearum Phylotype-4, which infects a wide range of bananas, from bananas used for consumption to wild bananas. In West Sumatera, the disease killed 1.40% of bananas in 1998, and then increased dramatically to 37.9% in 2003. The total banana production dropped to 62% in this province. The search for controlling the vector has led to the pre-investigation of Wild Zingiberaceae Elettariopsis slahmong C.K. Lim which has a stink bug odour similar to a methidathion insecticide.

Injury-induced BMP signaling negatively regulates Drosophila midgut homeostasis,23733344,10.1083/jcb.201302049,"Although much is known about injury-induced signals that increase rates of Drosophila melanogaster midgut intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation, it is largely unknown how ISC activity returns to quiescence after injury. In this paper, we show that the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway has dual functions during midgut homeostasis. Constitutive BMP signaling pathway activation in the middle midgut mediated regional specification by promoting copper cell differentiation. In the anterior and posterior midgut, injury-induced BMP signaling acted autonomously in ISCs to limit proliferation and stem cell number after injury. Loss of BMP signaling pathway members in the midgut epithelium or loss of the BMP signaling ligand decapentaplegic from visceral muscle resulted in phenotypes similar to those described for juvenile polyposis syndrome, a human intestinal tumor caused by mutations in BMP signaling pathway components. Our data establish a new link between injury and hyperplasia and may provide insight into how BMP signaling mutations drive formation of human intestinal cancers.",2013,"Zheng Guo, Ian Driver, Benjamin Ohlstein, Zheng Guo, Ian Driver, Benjamin Ohlstein"

"Complexity of the genetic basis of ageing in nature revealed by a clinal study of lifespan and methuselah, a gene for ageing, in Drosophila from eastern Australia",23802551,10.1111/mec.12353,"Clinal studies are a powerful tool for understanding the genetic basis of climatic adaptation. However, while clines in quantitative traits and genetic polymorphisms have been observed within and across continents, few studies have attempted to demonstrate direct links between them. The gene methuselah in Drosophila has been shown to have a major effect on stress response and longevity phenotypes based largely on laboratory studies of induced mutations in the mth gene. Clinal patterns in the most common mth haplotype and for lifespan (both increasing with latitude) have been observed in North American populations of D. melanogaster, implicating climatic selection. While these clinal patterns have led some to suggest that mth influences ageing in natural populations, limited evidence on the association between the two has so far been collected. Here, we describe a significant cline in the mth haplotype in eastern Australian D. melanogaster populations that parallel the cline in North America. We also describe a cline in mth gene expression. These findings further support the idea that mth is itself under selection. In contrast, we show that lifespan has a strong nonlinear clinal pattern, increasing southwards from the tropics, but then decreasing again from mid-latitudes. Furthermore, in association studies, we find no evidence for a direct link between mth haplotype and lifespan.

The activity ofJH degradation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP, an enzyme regulating DA synthesis) were used as indicators of JH and DA levels, respectively. We demonstrated that, under normal conditions, the ubiquitous inhibition of the InR gene expression in D. melanogaster females induced an increase in the JH degradation and ALP activity. As we have already shown, this is indicative of the decrease in the concentration of the above hormones. It was also found that the total inactivation of InR does not affect the initiation ofJ H and DA metabolic system response to heat stress; however, it does affect its intensity.

Dissecting the mechanisms of linezolid resistance in a Drosophila melanogaster infection model of Staphylococcus aureus,23547139,10.1093/infdis/jit138,"Background:
      
    

    
       Mini-host models are simple experimental systems to study host-pathogen interactions. We adapted a Drosophila melanogaster infection model to evaluate the in vivo effect of different mechanisms of linezolid (LNZ) resistance in Staphylococcus aureus.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
       Fly survival was evaluated after infection with LNZ-resistant S. aureus strains NRS119 (which has mutations in 23S ribosomal RNA [rRNA]), CM-05 and 004-737X (which carry cfr), LNZ-susceptible derivatives of CM-05 and 004-737X (which lack cfr), and ATCC 29213 (an LNZ-susceptible control). Flies were then fed food mixed with LNZ (concentration, 15-500 Âµg/mL). Results were compared to those in mouse peritonitis, using LNZ via oral gavage at 80 and 120 mg/kg every 12 hours.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
       LNZ at 500 Âµg/mL in fly food protected against all strains, while concentrations of 15-250 Âµg/mL failed to protect against NRS119 (survival, 1.6%-20%). An in vivo effect of cfr was only detected at concentrations of 30 and 15 Âµg/mL. In the mouse peritonitis model, LNZ (at doses that mimic human pharmacokinetics) protected mice from challenge with the cfr+ 004-737X strain but was ineffective against the NRS119 strain, which carried 23S rRNA mutations.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:

Lack of mutagenic effect by multi-walled functionalized carbon nanotubes in the somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,23994091,10.1016/j.fct.2013.08.051,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are formed by rolling up a single graphite sheet into a tube. Among the different types of CNTs, the multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) comprise a set of concentric nanotubes with perfect structures. Several uses for MWCNTs have been suggested to be included in biological applications such as manufacturing of biosensors, carriers of drugs. However, before these materials can be put on the market, it is necessary to know their genotoxic effects. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the mutagenicity of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) functionalized in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster, using the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART). This assay detects the loss of heterozygosity of marker genes expressed phenotypically on the wings of the fly. Larvae of three days were used, resulting from ST cross, with basal levels of the cytochrome P450 and larvae of high metabolic bioactivity capacity (HB cross). They were treated with different concentrations of MWCNTs functionalized. The MH descendants, analyzed in both ST and HB crosses, had no significant effects on the frequency of mutant. Based on the results and on the experimental conditions mentioned in this study, it was concluded that MWCNTs were not mutagenic in D. melanogaster.",2013,"N M Machado, J C Lopes, R S Saturnino, E B Fagan, J C Nepomuceno, N M Machado, J C Lopes, R S Saturnino, E B Fagan, J C Nepomuceno"

Capping protein beta is required for actin cytoskeleton organisation and cell migration during Drosophila oogenesis,23339103,10.1002/cbin.10025,"Capping protein (CP) is a well-characterised actin-binding protein important for regulation of actin filament (AF) assembly.

[1996] J Cell Biol 133: 1293-305). The cpb level is reduced in the Drosophila bristle actin cytoskeleton and becomes disorganised with abnormal morphology. A reduced level of the CP protein in ovary results in disruption of oocyte determination, and disturbance of nurse cell (NC) cortical integrity and dumping. We describe novel defects appearing in cpb mutants during oogenesis, in which cpb plays an important role in border and centripetal follicle cell migration, ring canal development and cytoplasmic AF formation. The number of long cytoplasmic AFs was dramatically reduced in cpb hypomorphs and abnormal actin aggregates was seen on the inner side of NC membranes. A hypothesis to explain the formation of abnormal short-cut cytoplasmic AFs and actin aggregates in the cpb mutant NCs was proffered, along with a discussion of the reasons for 'dumpless' phenotype formation in the mutants.",2013,"Anna A Ogienko, Dmitry A Karagodin, Valentina V Lashina, Sergey I Baiborodin, Eugeniya S Omelina, Elina M Baricheva, Anna A Ogienko, Dmitry A Karagodin, Valentina V Lashina, Sergey I Baiborodin, Eugeniya S Omelina, Elina M Baricheva"

"Gene duplication in the major insecticide target site, Rdl, in Drosophila melanogaster",23959864,10.1073/pnas.1311341110,"The Resistance to Dieldrin gene, Rdl, encodes a GABA-gated chloride channel subunit that is targeted by cyclodiene and phenylpyrazole insecticides. The gene was first characterized in Drosophila melanogaster by genetic mapping of resistance to the cyclodiene dieldrin. The 4,000-fold resistance observed was due to a single amino acid replacement, Ala(301) to Ser. The equivalent change was subsequently identified in Rdl orthologs of a large range of resistant insect species. Here, we report identification of a duplication at the Rdl locus in D. melanogaster. The 113-kb duplication contains one WT copy of Rdl and a second copy with two point mutations: an Ala(301) to Ser resistance mutation and Met(360) to Ile replacement. Individuals with this duplication exhibit intermediate dieldrin resistance compared with single copy Ser(301) homozygotes, reduced temperature sensitivity, and altered RNA editing associated with the resistant allele. Ectopic recombination between Roo transposable elements is involved in generating this genomic rearrangement. The duplication phenotypes were confirmed by construction of a transgenic, artificial duplication integrating the 55.7-kb Rdl locus with a Ser(301) change into an Ala(301) background. Gene duplications can contribute significantly to the evolution of insecticide resistance, most commonly by increasing the amount of gene product produced. Here however, duplication of the Rdl target site creates permanent heterozygosity, providing unique potential for adaptive mutations to accrue in one copy, without abolishing the endogenous role of an essential gene.",2013,"Emily J Remnant, Robert T Good, Joshua M Schmidt, Christopher Lumb, Charles Robin, Phillip J Daborn, Philip Batterham, Emily J Remnant, Robert T Good, Joshua M Schmidt, Christopher Lumb, Charles Robin, Phillip J Daborn, Philip Batterham"
Ovulation in Drosophila is controlled by secretory cells of the female reproductive tract,23599892,10.7554/eLife.00415,"How oocytes are transferred into an oviduct with a receptive environment remains poorly known. We found that glands of the Drosophila female reproductive tract, spermathecae and/or parovaria, are required for ovulation and to promote sperm storage. Reducing total secretory cell number by interferring with Notch signaling during development blocked ovulation. Knocking down expression after adult eclosion of the nuclear hormone receptor Hr39, a master regulator of gland development, slowed ovulation and blocked sperm storage. However, ovulation (but not sperm storage) continued when only canonical protein secretion was compromised in adult glands. Our results imply that proteins secreted during adulthood by the canonical secretory pathway from female reproductive glands are needed to store sperm, while a non-canonical glandular secretion stimulates ovulation. Our results suggest that the reproductive tract signals to the ovary using glandular secretions, and that this pathway has been conserved during evolution.

Here I present a simple protocol to genetically induce, observe and then analyze the progression of tumors in Drosophila larvae.

Broad RNA interference-mediated antiviral immunity and virus-specific inducible responses in Drosophila,23255357,10.4049/jimmunol.1102486,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a good model to unravel the molecular mechanisms of innate immunity and has led to some important discoveries about the sensing and signaling of microbial infections. The response of Drosophila to virus infections remains poorly characterized and appears to involve two facets. On the one hand, RNA interference involves the recognition and processing of dsRNA into small interfering RNAs by the host RNase Dicer-2 (Dcr-2), whereas, on the other hand, an inducible response controlled by the evolutionarily conserved JAK-STAT pathway contributes to the antiviral host defense. To clarify the contribution of the small interfering RNA and JAK-STAT pathways to the control of viral infections, we have compared the resistance of flies wild-type and mutant for Dcr-2 or the JAK kinase Hopscotch to infections by seven RNA or DNA viruses belonging to different families. Our results reveal a unique susceptibility of hop mutant flies to infection by Drosophila C virus and cricket paralysis virus, two members of the Dicistroviridae family, which contrasts with the susceptibility of Dcr-2 mutant flies to many viruses, including the DNA virus invertebrate iridescent virus 6. Genome-wide microarray analysis confirmed that different sets of genes were induced following infection by Drosophila C virus or by two unrelated RNA viruses, Flock House virus and Sindbis virus. Overall, our data reveal that RNA interference is an efficient antiviral mechanism, operating against a large range of viruses, including a DNA virus.

Ferritin is the key to dietary iron absorption and tissue iron detoxification in Drosophila melanogaster,23064556,10.1096/fj.12-213595,"Mammalian ferritin is predominantly in the cytosol, with a minor portion found in plasma. In most insects, including Drosophila melanogaster, ferritin belongs to the secretory type. The functional role of secretory ferritin in iron homeostasis remains poorly understood in insects as well as in mammalians. Here we used Drosophila to dissect the involvement of ferritin in insect iron metabolism. Midgut-specific knockdown of ferritin resulted in iron accumulation in the gut but systemic iron deficiency (37% control), accompanied by retarded development and reduced survival (3% survival), and was rescued by dietary iron supplementation (50% survival) or exacerbated by iron depletion (0% survival). These results suggest an essential role of ferritin in removing iron from enterocytes across the basolateral membrane. Expression of wild-type ferritin in the midgut, especially in the iron cell region, could significantly rescue ferritin-null mutants (first-instar larvae rescued up to early adults), indicating iron deficiency as the major cause of early death for ferritin flies. In many nonintestinal tissues, tissue-specific ferritin knockdown also caused local iron accumulation (100% increase) and resulted in severe tissue damage, as evidenced by cell loss. Overall, our study demonstrated Drosophila ferritin is essential to two key aspects of iron homeostasis: dietary iron absorption and tissue iron detoxification.",2013,"Xiaona Tang, Bing Zhou, Xiaona Tang, Bing Zhou"
Mating regulates neuromodulator ensembles at nerve termini innervating the Drosophila reproductive tract,24631240,10.1016/j.cub.2014.02.042,"Upon mating, regions of the female reproductive tract mature and alter their function [1-3], for example to facilitate storage of sperm or control the release of eggs [4-6]. The female's nervous system and neuromodulators play important roles in her responses to mating [7-13]. However, it is difficult to reconcile the reproductive tract's many changing but coordinated events with the small set of neuromodulators present [14-18]. We hypothesized that each part of the reproductive tract contains a characteristic combination of neuromodulators that confer unique identities on each region and that postmating changes in these combinations coordinate subsequent actions. We examined the presence, locations, and levels of neuromodulators and related molecules (""signaling molecules"") in the reproductive tract of Drosophila melanogaster females before and after mating: the biogenic amine octopamine, which regulates ovulation rate in Drosophila and locusts [7, 14-20]; serotonin, which regulates muscle contraction in locust oviducts [21]; and the FMRF amide dromyosuppressin, which regulates contraction of Drosophila heart muscle [22] and may regulate muscle contractions in the reproductive tract, if it is expressed there. We find that separate aspects of mating (sperm, seminal proteins, and physical effects) independently modulate the release of signaling molecules. Each reproductive tract subregion displays a characteristic combination of signaling molecule release, resulting in a unique functional identity. These patterns, and thus functions, change reproducibly after mating. Thus, one event (mating) promotes new combinations of signaling molecules that endow different parts of the reproductive tract with unique temporal and spatial identities that facilitate many aspects of fertilization.",2014,"Yael Heifetz, Moshe Lindner, Yuval Garini, Mariana F Wolfner, Yael Heifetz, Moshe Lindner, Yuval Garini, Mariana F Wolfner"

Flies with increased sleep for up to two days prior to a bacterial infection showed increased resistance to the infection and improved survival. These flies also had increased expression levels of a subset of anti-microbial peptide mRNA prior to infection, as well as increased NFÎºB activity during infection as indicated by in vivo luciferase reporter activity. In contrast, flies that experienced reduced sleep for up to two days prior to infection had no effect on survival or on NFÎºB activity during infection. However, flies with reduced sleep showed an altered defense mechanism, such that resistance to infection was increased, but at the expense of reduced tolerance. This effect was dependent on environmental condition.

Correlated variation and population differentiation in satellite DNA abundance among lines of Drosophila melanogaster,25512552,10.1073/pnas.1421951112,"Tandemly repeating satellite DNA elements in heterochromatin occupy a substantial portion of many eukaryotic genomes. Although often characterized as genomic parasites deleterious to the host, they also can be crucial for essential processes such as chromosome segregation. Adding to their interest, satellite DNA elements evolve at high rates; among Drosophila, closely related species often differ drastically in both the types and abundances of satellite repeats. However, due to technical challenges, the evolutionary mechanisms driving this rapid turnover remain unclear. Here we characterize natural variation in simple-sequence repeats of 2-10 bp from inbred Drosophila melanogaster lines derived from multiple populations, using a method we developed called k-Seek that analyzes unassembled Illumina sequence reads. In addition to quantifying all previously described satellite repeats, we identified many novel repeats of low to medium abundance. Many of the repeats show population differentiation, including two that are present in only some populations. Interestingly, the population structure inferred from overall satellite quantities does not recapitulate the expected population relationships based on the demographic history of D. melanogaster. We also find that some satellites of similar sequence composition are correlated across lines, revealing concerted evolution. Moreover, correlated satellites tend to be interspersed with each other, further suggesting that concerted change is partially driven by higher order structure. Surprisingly, we identified negative correlations among some satellites, suggesting antagonistic interactions. Our study demonstrates that current genome assemblies vastly underestimate the complexity, abundance, and variation of highly repetitive satellite DNA and presents approaches to understand their rapid evolutionary divergence.",2014,"Kevin H-C Wei, Jennifer K Grenier, Daniel A Barbash, Andrew G Clark, Kevin H-C Wei, Jennifer K Grenier, Daniel A Barbash, Andrew G Clark"

A small system--high-resolution study of metabolic adaptation in the central metabolic pathway to temperate climates in Drosophila melanogaster,24770333,10.1093/molbev/msu146,"In this article, we couple the geographic variation in 127 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequencies in genes of 46 enzymes of central metabolism with their associated cis-expression variation to predict latitudinal or climatic-driven gene expression changes in the metabolic architecture of Drosophila melanogaster. Forty-two percent of the SNPs in 65% of the genes show statistically significant clines in frequency with latitude across the 20 local population samples collected from southern Florida to Ontario. A number of SNPs in the screened genes are also associated with significant expression variation within the Raleigh population from North Carolina. A principal component analysis of the full variance-covariance matrix of latitudinal changes in SNP-associated standardized gene expression allows us to identify those major genes in the pathway and its associated branches that are likely targets of natural selection. When embedded in a central metabolic context, we show that these apparent targets are concentrated in the genes of the upper glycolytic pathway and pentose shunt, those controlling glycerol shuttle activity, and finally those enzymes associated with the utilization of glutamate and pyruvate. These metabolites possess high connectivity and thus may be the points where flux balance can be best shifted. We also propose that these points are conserved points associated with coupling energy homeostasis and energy sensing in mammals.

Temporal integration of cholinergic and GABAergic inputs in isolated insect mushroom body neurons exposes pairing-specific signal processing,25429149,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0714-14.2014,"GABAergic modulation of neuronal activity plays a crucial role in physiological processes including learning and memory in both insects and mammals. During olfactory learning in honeybees (Apis mellifera) and Drosophila melanogaster the temporal relation between excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory GABAergic inputs critically affects learning. However, the cellular mechanisms of temporal integration of these antagonistic inputs are unknown. To address this question, we use calcium imaging of isolated honeybee and Drosophila Kenyon cells (KCs), which are targets of cholinergic and GABAergic inputs during olfactory learning. In the whole population of honeybee KCs we find that pairing of acetylcholine (ACh) and Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) Comment: Please use the greek letter for gamma reduces the ACh-induced calcium influx, and depending on their temporal sequence, induces different forms of neuronal plasticity. After ACh-GABA pairing the calcium influx of a subsequent excitatory stimulus is increased, while GABA-ACh pairing affects the decay time leading to elevated calcium levels during the late phase of a subsequent excitatory stimulus. In an exactly defined subset of Drosophila KCs implicated in learning we find similar pairing-specific differences. Specifically the GABA-ACh pairing splits the KCs in two functional subgroups: one is only weakly inhibited by GABA and shows no neuronal plasticity and the other subgroup is strongly inhibited by GABA and shows elevated calcium levels during the late phase of a subsequent excitatory stimulus. Our findings provide evidence that insect KCs are capable of contributing to temporal processing of cholinergic and GABAergic inputs, which provides a neuronal mechanism of the differential temporal role of GABAergic inhibition during learning.",2014,"Davide Raccuglia, Uli Mueller, Davide Raccuglia, Uli Mueller"
Hygienic grooming is induced by contact chemicals in Drosophila melanogaster,25100963,10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00254,"In social insects, grooming is considered as a behavioral defense against pathogen and parasite infections since it contributes to remove microbes from their cuticle. However, stimuli which trigger this behavior are not well characterized yet. We examined if activating contact chemoreceptive sensilla could trigger grooming activities in Drosophila melanogaster. We monitored the grooming responses of decapitated flies to compounds known to activate the immune system, e.g., dead Escherichia coli (Ec) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and to tastants such as quinine, sucrose, and salt. LPS, quinine, and Ec were quite effective in triggering grooming movements when touching the distal border of the wings and the legs, while sucrose had no effect. Contact chemoreceptors are necessary and sufficient to elicit such responses, as grooming could not be elicited by LPS in poxn mutants deprived of external taste sensilla, and as grooming was elicited by light when a channel rhodopsin receptor was expressed in bitter-sensitive cells expressing Gr33a. Contact chemoreceptors distributed along the distal border of the wings respond to these tastants by an increased spiking activity, in response to quinine, Ec, LPS, sucrose, and KCl. These results demonstrate for the first time that bacterial compounds trigger grooming activities in D. melanogaster, and indicate that contact chemoreceptors located on the wings participate in the detection of such chemicals.",2014,"Aya Yanagawa, Alexandra M A Guigue, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Marion-Poll, Aya Yanagawa, Alexandra M A Guigue, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Marion-Poll"
Effects of five Ayurvedic herbs on locomotor behaviour in a Drosophila melanogaster Parkinson's disease model,25091506,10.1002/ptr.5199,"Current conventional treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) are aimed at symptom management, as there is currently no known cure or treatment that can slow down its progression.

Herbs commonly used for this purpose are Zandopa (containing Mucuna pruriens), Withania somnifera, Centella asiatica, Sida cordifolia and Bacopa monnieri. In this study, these herbs were tested for their potential ability to improve climbing ability of a fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) PD model based on loss of function of phosphatase and tensin-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1). Fruit flies were cultured on food containing individual herbs or herbal formulations, a combination of all five herbs, levodopa (positive control) or no treatment (negative control). Tests were performed in both PINK1 mutant flies and healthy wild-type (WT) flies. A significant improvement in climbing ability was observed in flies treated with B. monnieri compared with untreated PINK1 mutant flies. However, a significant decrease in climbing ability was observed in WT flies for the same herb. Centella asiatica also significantly decreased climbing ability in WT flies.

External and circadian inputs modulate synaptic protein expression in the visual system of Drosophila melanogaster,24772085,10.3389/fphys.2014.00102,"In the visual system of Drosophila melanogaster the retina photoreceptors form tetrad synapses with the first order interneurons, amacrine cells and glial cells in the first optic neuropil (lamina), in order to transmit photic and visual information to the brain. Using the specific antibodies against synaptic proteins; Bruchpilot (BRP), Synapsin (SYN), and Disc Large (DLG), the synapses in the distal lamina were specifically labeled. Then their abundance was measured as immunofluorescence intensity in flies held in light/dark (LD 12:12), constant darkness (DD), and after locomotor and light stimulation. Moreover, the levels of proteins (SYN and DLG), and mRNAs of the brp, syn, and dlg genes, were measured in the fly's head and brain, respectively. In the head we did not detect SYN and DLG oscillations. We found, however, that in the lamina, DLG oscillates in LD 12:12 and DD but SYN cycles only in DD. The abundance of all synaptic proteins was also changed in the lamina after locomotor and light stimulation. One hour locomotor stimulations at different time points in LD 12:12 affected the pattern of the daily rhythm of synaptic proteins. In turn, light stimulations in DD increased the level of all proteins studied. In the case of SYN, however, this effect was observed only after a short light pulse (15 min). In contrast to proteins studied in the lamina, the mRNA of brp, syn, and dlg genes in the brain was not cycling in LD 12:12 and DD, except the mRNA of dlg in LD 12:12. Our earlier results and obtained in the present study showed that the abundance of BRP, SYN and DLG in the distal lamina, at the tetrad synapses, is regulated by light and a circadian clock while locomotor stimulation affects their daily pattern of expression. The observed changes in the level of synaptic markers reflect the circadian plasticity of tetrad synapses regulated by the circadian clock and external inputs, both specific and unspecific for the visual system.",2014,"Wojciech Krzeptowski, Jolanta GÃ³rska-Andrzejak, Ewelina Kijak, Alicja GÃ¶rlich, ElÅ¼bieta Guzik, Gareth Moore, ElÅ¼bieta M Pyza, Wojciech Krzeptowski, Jolanta GÃ³rska-Andrzejak, Ewelina Kijak, Alicja GÃ¶rlich, ElÅ¼bieta Guzik, Gareth Moore, ElÅ¼bieta M Pyza"
Over-expression of superoxide dismutase ameliorates Cr(VI) induced adverse effects via modulating cellular immune system of Drosophila melanogaster,24505420,10.1371/journal.pone.0088181,"The evolutionarily conserved innate immune system plays critical role for maintaining the health of an organism. However, a number of environmental chemicals including metals are known to exert adverse effects on immune system. The present study assessed the in vivo effect of a major environmental chemical, Cr(VI), on cellular immune response using Drosophila melanogaster and subsequently the protective role of superoxide dismutase (SOD) based on the comparable performance of the tested anti-oxidant enzymes. The immuno-modulatory potential of Cr(VI) was demonstrated by observing a significant reduction in the total hemocyte count along with impaired phagocytic activity in exposed organism. Concurrently, a significant increase in the percentage of Annexin V-FITC positive cells, activation of DEVDase activity, generation of free radical species along with inhibition of anti-oxidant enzyme activities was observed in the hemocytes of exposed organism. In addition, we have shown that ONOO(-) is primarily responsible for Cr(VI) induced adverse effects on Drosophila hemocytes along with O2(-). While generation of O2(-)/ONOO(-) in Cr(VI) exposed Drosophila hemocytes was found to be responsible for the suppression of Drosophila cellular immune response, Cr(VI) induced alteration was significantly reduced by the over-expression of sod in Drosophila hemocytes. Overall, our results suggest that manipulation of one of the anti-oxidant genes, sod, benefits the organism from Cr(VI) induced alteration in cellular immunity.

Regulation of natural mRNAs by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway,25038084,10.1128/EC.00090-14,"The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway is a specialized mRNA degradation pathway that degrades select mRNAs. This pathway is conserved in all eukaryotes examined so far, and it triggers the degradation of mRNAs that prematurely terminate translation. Originally identified as a pathway that degrades mRNAs with premature termination codons as a result of errors during transcription, splicing, or damage to the mRNA, NMD is now also recognized as a pathway that degrades some natural mRNAs. The degradation of natural mRNAs by NMD has been identified in multiple eukaryotes, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, and humans. S. cerevisiae is used extensively as a model to study natural mRNA regulation by NMD. Inactivation of the NMD pathway in S. cerevisiae affects approximately 10% of the transcriptome. Similar percentages of natural mRNAs in the D. melanogaster and human transcriptomes are also sensitive to the pathway, indicating that NMD is important for the regulation of gene expression in multiple organisms. NMD can either directly or indirectly regulate the decay rate of natural mRNAs. Direct NMD targets possess NMD-inducing features. This minireview focuses on the regulation of natural mRNAs by the NMD pathway, as well as the features demonstrated to target these mRNAs for decay by the pathway in S. cerevisiae. We also compare NMD-targeting features identified in S. cerevisiae with known NMD-targeting features in other eukaryotic organisms.",2014,"Megan Peccarelli, Bessie W Kebaara, Megan Peccarelli, Bessie W Kebaara"

Our system permitted sensitive quantification of circulating Ilp2, including measures of Ilp2 dynamics during fasting and re-feeding, and demonstration of adaptive Ilp2 secretion in response to insulin receptor haploinsufficiency. Tissue specific dissection of this reduced insulin signaling phenotype revealed a critical role for insulin signaling in specific peripheral tissues.

H3K79 methylation: a new conserved mark that accompanies H4 hyperacetylation prior to histone-to-protamine transition in Drosophila and rat,24795146,10.1242/bio.20147302,"During spermiogenesis, haploid spermatids undergo extensive chromatin remodeling events in which histones are successively replaced by more basic protamines to generate highly compacted chromatin.

During Drosophila spermatogenesis, the Dot1-like methyltransferase Grappa (Gpp) is primarily expressed in canoe stage nuclei. The corresponding H3K79 methylation is a histone modification that precedes the histone-to-protamine transition and correlates with histone H4 hyperacetylation. When acetylation was inhibited in cultured Drosophila testes, nuclei were smaller and chromatin was compact, Gpp was little synthesized, H3K79 methylation was strongly reduced, and protamines were not synthesized. The Gpp isoform Gpp-D has a unique C-terminus, and Gpp is essential for full fertility. In rat, H3K79 methylation also correlates with H4 hyperacetylation but not with active RNA polymerase II, which might point towards a conserved function in chromatin remodeling during the histone-to-protamine transition in both Drosophila and rat.",2014,"Christine Dottermusch-Heidel, Stefanie M K GÃ¤rtner, Isabel Tegeder, Christina Rathke, Bridlin Barckmann, Marek Bartkuhn, Sudhanshu Bhushan, Klaus Steger, Andreas Meinhardt, Renate Renkawitz-Pohl, Christine Dottermusch-Heidel, Stefanie M K GÃ¤rtner, Isabel Tegeder, Christina Rathke, Bridlin Barckmann, Marek Bartkuhn, Sudhanshu Bhushan, Klaus Steger, Andreas Meinhardt, Renate Renkawitz-Pohl"
Somatic cell mutations caused by 365 nm LED-UVA due to DNA double-strand breaks through oxidative damage,25027494,10.1039/c4pp00148f,"Evidence is accumulating indicating that UVA (320-400 nm ultraviolet light) plays an important role in photo-carcinogenesis. UVA is thought to produce reactive oxygen species in irradiated cells through photo-activation of inherent photosensitizers, and was recently reported to cause DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in exposed cells. We have investigated the involvement of UVA in mutations and DNA damage in somatic cells using Drosophila melanogaster larvae. Using the Okazaki Large Spectrograph, we previously observed that longer wavelength UVA (>330 nm) was more mutagenic in post-replication repair-deficient D. melanogaster (mei-41) than in the nucleotide excision repair-deficient strain (mei-9). LED-light has recently been developed as a high-dose-rate UVA source. LED-UVA light (365 nm) was also more mutagenic in mei-41 than in mei-9. The mei-41 gene was shown to be an orthologue of the human ATR gene, which is involved in the repair of DSBs through phosphorylation of histone H2AX. In order to estimate the extent to which oxidative damage contributes to mutation, we established a new D. melanogaster strain (urate-null mutant) that is sensitive to oxidative damage and has a marker to detect somatic cell mutations. When somatic cell mutations were examined using this strain, LED-UVA was mutagenic in the urate-null strain at doses that were non-mutagenic in the urate-positive strain. In an effort to investigate the generation of DSBs, we examined the presence of phosphorylated histone H2AvD (H2AX D. melanogaster homologue). At high doses of LED-UVA (>800 kJ m(-2)), levels of phosphorylated H2AvD (Î³-H2AvD) increased significantly in the urate-null strain. Moreover, the level of Î³-H2AvD increased in the excision repair-deficient strain but not in the ATR-deficient strain following UVA-irradiation. These results supported the notion that the generation of Î³-H2AvD was mediated by the function of the mei-41 gene. It was reported that ATR functions on DSB repair in D. melanogaster.

Overexpression of dSirt2 increased complex V activity. Substitution of Lys 259 and Lys 480 with Arg in human ATP synthase Î², mimicking deacetylation, increased complex V activity, whereas substitution with Gln, mimicking acetylation, decreased activity. Mass spectrometry and proteomic experiments from wild-type and dsirt2 mitochondria identified the Drosophila mitochondrial acetylome and revealed dSirt2 as an important regulator of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Additionally, we unravel a ceramide-NAD(+)-sirtuin axis wherein increased ceramide, a sphingolipid known to induce stress responses, resulted in depletion of NAD(+) and consequent decrease in sirtuin activity.

We show that loss of Rab11 leads to accumulation of autophagosomes and late endosomes in Drosophila melanogaster. Rab11 translocates from recycling endosomes to autophagosomes in response to autophagy induction and physically interacts with Hook, a negative regulator of endosome maturation. Hook anchors endosomes to microtubules, and we show that Rab11 facilitates the fusion of endosomes and autophagosomes by removing Hook from mature late endosomes and inhibiting its homodimerization.

Endogenously imprinted genes in Drosophila melanogaster,24658702,10.1007/s00438-014-0840-6,"Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic state that results from differential processing of chromosomes during gametogenesis and which can cause differential expression of genes depending on the sex of the parent transmitting that gene. In Drosophila, many examples of imprinted marker genes have been documented and imprinting of these genes involves highly conserved epigenetic regulators. However, no endogenously imprinted genes have yet been identified. Here we present a phenotypic and transcriptional analysis of parthenogenetic (gynogenetic) and genotypically identical but sexually produced adult female Drosophila. We find that while parthenogenetic females have a superficially normal phenotype and are viable and fertile, their lifespan is extended relative to their sexually-produced counterparts. Microarray/transcriptional analysis of parthenogenetic versus sexually-produced females reveals 76 genes with consistently altered patterns of expression, 36 upregulated and 40 downregulated, some with known effects on aging. Analysis of individuals with uniparental inheritance of only portions of their genome suggest that many of these genes may be indirectly imprinted, responding to either other imprinted genes or redistribution of chromatin components that are differentially allocated to sex and autosomal heterochromatin in a sex-dependent manner during gametogenesis. As gene expression dependent on the parental origin of the genome meets the definition of genomic imprinting, our study provides evidence that endogenous genes are imprinted in Drosophila.",2014,"Lori A McEachern, Nicholas J Bartlett, Vett K Lloyd, Lori A McEachern, Nicholas J Bartlett, Vett K Lloyd"
Extension of Drosophila lifespan by cinnamon through a sex-specific dependence on the insulin receptor substrate chico,25456850,10.1016/j.exger.2014.09.019,"Cinnamon is a spice commonly used worldwide to flavor desserts, fruits, cereals, breads, and meats.

Insulin signaling is an integral pathway regulating the lifespan of laboratory organisms, such as worms, flies, and mice. We posited that if cinnamon truly improved the clinical signs of diabetes in people that it would also act on insulin signaling in laboratory organisms and increase lifespan. We found that cinnamon did extend lifespan in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. However, it had no effect on the expression levels of the 3 aging-related Drosophila insulin-like peptides nor did it alter sugar, fat, or soluble protein levels, as would be predicted. In addition, cinnamon exhibited no protective effects in males against oxidative challenges. However, in females it did confer a protective effect against paraquat, but sensitized them to iron. Cinnamon provided no protective effect against desiccation and starvation in females, but sensitized males to both. Interestingly, cinnamon protected both sexes against cold, sensitized both to heat, and elevated HSP70 expression levels. We also found that cinnamon required the insulin receptor substrate to extend lifespan in males, but not females.

Thermal adaptation of cellular membranes in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster,25382893,10.1111/1365-2435.12264,"Changes in temperature disrupt the fluidity of cellular membranes, which can negatively impact membrane integrity and cellular processes. Many ectotherms, including Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen), adjust the glycerophospholipid composition of their membranes to restore optimal fluidity when temperatures change, a type of trait plasticity termed homeoviscous adaptation.Existing data suggest that plasticity in the relative abundances of the glycerophospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) underlies cellular adaptation to temporal variability in the thermal environment. For example, laboratory populations of D. melanogaster evolved in the presence of temporally variable temperatures have greater developmental plasticity of the ratio of PE to PC (PE/PC) and greater fecundity than do populations evolved at constant temperatures.Here, we extend this work to natural populations of D. melanogaster by evaluating thermal plasticity of glycerophospholipid composition at different life stages, in genotypes isolated from Vermont, Indiana and North Carolina, USA. We also quantify the covariance between developmental and adult (reversible) plasticity, and between adult responses of the membrane to cool and warm thermal shifts.As predicted by physiological models of homeoviscous adaptation, flies from all populations decrease PE/PC and the degree of lipid unsaturation in response to warm temperatures. Furthermore, these populations have diverged in their degree of membrane plasticity. Flies from the most variable thermal environment (Vermont, USA) decrease PE/PC to a greater extent than do other populations when developed at a warm temperature, a pattern that matches our previous observation in laboratory-evolved populations. We also find that developmental plasticity and adult plasticity of PE/PC covary across genotypes, but that adult responses to cool and warm thermal shifts do not.When combined with our previous observations of laboratory-evolved populations, our findings implicate developmental plasticity of PE/PC as a mechanism of thermal adaptation in temporally variable environments. While little is known about the genetic bases of plastic responses to temperature, our observations suggest that both environmentally sensitive and environmentally specific alleles contribute to thermal adaptation of membranes, and that costs of plasticity may arise when the adult environment differs from that experienced during development.",2014,"Brandon S Cooper, Loubna A Hammad, Kristi L Montooth, Brandon S Cooper, Loubna A Hammad, Kristi L Montooth"
Metagenome-wide association of microbial determinants of host phenotype in Drosophila melanogaster,25271286,10.1128/mBio.01631-14,"Animal-associated bacteria (microbiota) affect host behaviors and physiological traits. To identify bacterial genetic determinants of microbiota-responsive host traits, we employed a metagenome-wide association (MGWA) approach in two steps. First, we measured two microbiota-responsive host traits, development time and triglyceride (TAG) content, in Drosophila melanogaster flies monoassociated with each of 41 bacterial strains. The effects of monoassociation on host traits were not confined to particular taxonomic groups. Second, we clustered protein-coding sequences of the bacteria by sequence similarity de novo and statistically associated the magnitude of the host trait with the bacterial gene contents. The animals had been monoassociated with genome-sequenced bacteria, so the metagenome content was unambiguous. This analysis showed significant effects of pyrroloquinoline quinone biosynthesis genes on development time, confirming the results of a published transposon mutagenesis screen, thereby validating the MGWA; it also identified multiple genes predicted to affect host TAG content, including extracellular glucose oxidation pathway components. To test the validity of the statistical associations, we expressed candidate genes in a strain that lacks them. Monoassociation with bacteria that ectopically expressed a predicted oxidoreductase or gluconate dehydrogenase conferred reduced Drosophila TAG contents relative to the TAG contents in empty vector controls. Consistent with the prediction that glucose oxidation pathway gene expression increased bacterial glucose utilization, the glucose content of the host diet was reduced when flies were exposed to these strains. Our findings indicate that microbiota affect host nutritional status through modulation of nutrient acquisition. Together, these findings demonstrate the utility of MGWA for identifying bacterial determinants of host traits and provide mechanistic insight into how gut microbiota modulate the nutritional status of a model host.

      To understand how certain gut bacteria promote the health of their animal hosts, we need to identify the bacterial genes that drive these beneficial relationships. This task is challenging because the bacterial communities can vary widely among different host individuals. To overcome this difficulty, we quantified how well each of 41 bacterial species protected Drosophila fruit flies from high fat content. The genomes of the chosen bacterial strains were previously sequenced, so we could statistically associate specific bacterial genes with bacterially mediated reduction in host fat content. Bacterial genes that promote glucose utilization were strongly represented in the association, and introducing these genes into the gut bacteria was sufficient to lower the animal's fat content. Our method is applicable to the study of many other host-microbe interactions as a way to uncover microbial genes important for host health.",2014,"John M Chaston, Peter D Newell, Angela E Douglas, John M Chaston, Peter D Newell, Angela E Douglas"

Myb complex functions to activate or repress transcription in a site-specific manner; however, the detailed mechanism is yet to be clearly understood. Members of the Drosophila melanogaster Myb-MuvB/dREAM complex have been known to regulate expression of a wide range of genes including those involved in regulating apoptosis. E2F and its corepressor RBF also belong to this complex and together they regulate expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, apoptosis, differentiation, and development. In the present study, we examined whether the depletion of dlin52 in developing photoreceptor neurons results in enhanced apoptosis and disorganisation of the ommatidia. Strikingly, we found that dLin52 is essential for transcriptional repression of the pro-apoptotic gene, hid; decrease in dlin52 levels led to dramatic induction of hid and apoptosis in eye-antennal discs. Reduction of Rpd3 (HDAC1), another member of the dREAM complex, also led to marginal upregulation of Hid. In addition, we also demonstrated that an optimum level of dLin52 is needed for dE2F1/2 activity on the hid promoter. dlin52 cooperates with dRBF and dE2F1/2 for recruitment of repressor complex on the hid promoter. Preliminary data indicate that Rpd3/HDAC1 also contributes to hid repression. Based on the findings, we conclude that dLin52 functions as a co-factor and modulates activity of members of dMyb/dREAM complex at hid promoter, thus regulating apoptosis by repressing this pro-apoptotic gene in the developing Drosophila eye.",2014,"Pradeep Kumar Bhaskar, Satya Surabhi, Bipin Kumar Tripathi, Ashim Mukherjee, Mousumi Mutsuddi, Pradeep Kumar Bhaskar, Satya Surabhi, Bipin Kumar Tripathi, Ashim Mukherjee, Mousumi Mutsuddi"
Hypoxia activates IKK-NF-ÎºB and the immune response in Drosophila melanogaster,24993778,10.1042/BSR20140095,"Hypoxia, or low oxygen availability, is an important physiological and pathological stimulus for multicellular organisms. Molecularly, hypoxia activates a transcriptional programme directed at restoration of oxygen homoeostasis and cellular survival. In mammalian cells, hypoxia not only activates the HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) family, but also additional transcription factors such as NF-ÎºB (nuclear factor ÎºB). Here we show that hypoxia activates the IKK-NF-ÎºB [IÎºB (inhibitor of nuclear factor ÎºB)-NF-ÎºB] pathway and the immune response in Drosophila melanogaster. We show that NF-ÎºB activation is required for organism survival in hypoxia. Finally, we identify a role for the tumour suppressor Cyld, as a negative regulator of NF-ÎºB in response to hypoxia in Drosophila. The results indicate that hypoxia activation of the IKK-NF-ÎºB pathway and the immune response is an important and evolutionary conserved response.",2014,"Daniel Bandarra, John Biddlestone, Sharon Mudie, H Arno Muller, Sonia Rocha, Daniel Bandarra, John Biddlestone, Sharon Mudie, H Arno Muller, Sonia Rocha"
Patterns of molecular evolution of the germ line specification gene oskar suggest that a novel domain may contribute to functional divergence in Drosophila,24407548,10.1007/s00427-013-0463-7,"In several metazoans including flies of the genus Drosophila, germ line specification occurs through the inheritance of maternally deposited cytoplasmic determinants, collectively called germ plasm. The novel insect gene oskar is at the top of the Drosophila germ line specification pathway, and also plays an important role in posterior patterning. A novel N-terminal domain of oskar (the Long Oskar domain) evolved in Drosophilids, but the role of this domain in oskar functional evolution is unknown. Trans-species transgenesis experiments have shown that oskar orthologs from different Drosophila species have functionally diverged, but the underlying selective pressures and molecular changes have not been investigated. As a first step toward understanding how Oskar function could have evolved, we applied molecular evolution analysis to oskar sequences from the completely sequenced genomes of 16 Drosophila species from the Sophophora subgenus, Drosophila virilis and Drosophila immigrans. We show that overall, this gene is subject to purifying selection, but that individual predicted structural and functional domains are subject to heterogeneous selection pressures. Specifically, two domains, the Drosophila-specific Long Osk domain and the region that interacts with the germ plasm protein Lasp, are evolving at a faster rate than other regions of oskar. Further, we provide evidence that positive selection may have acted on specific sites within these two domains on the D. virilis branch. Our domain-based analysis suggests that changes in the Long Osk and Lasp-binding domains are strong candidates for the molecular basis of functional divergence between the Oskar proteins of D. melanogaster and D. virilis. This molecular evolutionary analysis thus represents an important step towards understanding the role of an evolutionarily and developmentally critical gene in germ plasm evolution and assembly.",2014,"Abha Ahuja, Cassandra G Extavour, Abha Ahuja, Cassandra G Extavour"
Evolution of the techniques used in studying associative olfactory learning and memory in adult Drosophila in vivo: a historical and technical perspective,24149895,10.1007/s10158-013-0163-z,"Drosophila melanogaster behavioral mutants have been isolated in which the ability to form associative olfactory memories has been disrupted primarily by altering cyclic adenosine monophosphate signal transduction. Unfortunately, the small size of the fruit fly and its neurons has made the application of neurobiological techniques typically used to investigate the physiology underlying these behaviors daunting. However, the realization that adult fruit flies could tolerate a window in the head capsule allowing access to the central structures thought to be involved plus the development of genetically expressed reporters of neuronal function has allowed a meteoric expansion of this field over the last decade. This review attempts to summarize the evolution of the techniques involved from the first use of a window to access these brain areas thought to be involved in associative olfactory learning and memory, the mushroom bodies and antennal lobes, to the current refinements which allow both high-resolution multiphoton imaging and patch clamping of identified neurons while applying the stimuli used in the behavioral protocols.

Drosophila melanogaster cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes is a lysosomal protein essential for fly development,25173815,10.1016/j.bbamcr.2014.08.012,"Mammalian cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes is a lysosomal glycoprotein implicated in cellular growth and differentiation. The genome of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster encodes a putative orthologue (dCREG), suggesting evolutionarily conserved physiological functions of this protein. In D. melanogaster S2 cells, dCREG was found to localize in lysosomes. Further studies revealed that intracellular dCREG is subject of proteolytic maturation. Processing and turnover could be substantially reduced by RNAi-mediated silencing of cathepsin L. In contrast to mammalian cells, lysosomal delivery of dCREG does not depend on its carbohydrate moiety. Furthermore, depletion of the putative D. melanogaster lysosomal sorting receptor lysosomal enzyme receptor protein did not compromise cellular retention of dCREG. We also investigated the developmental consequences of dCREG ablation in whole D. melanogaster flies. Ubiquitous depletion of dCREG proved lethal at the late pupal stage once a knock-down efficiency of >95% was achieved. These results demonstrate that dCREG is essential for proper completion of fly development.",2014,"Elisabeth Kowalewski-Nimmerfall, Philipp SchÃ¤hs, Daniel Maresch, Dubravko Rendic, Helmut KrÃ¤mer, Lukas Mach"
Host adaptation to viruses relies on few genes with different cross-resistance properties,24711428,10.1073/pnas.1400378111,"Host adaptation to one parasite may affect its response to others. However, the genetics of these direct and correlated responses remains poorly studied. The overlap between these responses is instrumental for the understanding of host evolution in multiparasite environments. We determined the genetic and phenotypic changes underlying adaptation of Drosophila melanogaster to Drosophila C virus (DCV). Within 20 generations, flies selected with DCV showed increased survival after DCV infection, but also after cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) and flock house virus (FHV) infection. Whole-genome sequencing identified two regions of significant differentiation among treatments, from which candidate genes were functionally tested with RNAi. Three genes were validated--pastrel, a known DCV-response gene, and two other loci, Ubc-E2H and CG8492. Knockdown of Ubc-E2H and pastrel also led to increased sensitivity to CrPV, whereas knockdown of CG8492 increased susceptibility to FHV infection.

The life-span and health-span enhancing actions of the fruits of pomegranate (Punica granatum L.), a well-known Rasayana, were tested on Drosophila melanogaster (fruitfly) model. Supplementation of standard corn meal with 10% (v/v) pomegranate juice (PJ) extended the life-span of male and female flies by 18 and 8%, respectively. When male and female flies were mixed and reared together, there was 19% increase in the longevity of PJ fed flies, as assessed by MSD, the median survival day (24.8). MSD for control and resveratrol (RV) groups was at 20.8 and 23.1 days, respectively. A two-fold enhancement in fecundity, improved resistance to oxidative stress (H2O2 and paraquat induced) and to Candida albicans infection were observed in PJ fed flies. Further, the flies in the PJ fed group were physically active over an extended period of time, as assessed by the climbing assay.

Genetic dissection of photoreceptor subtype specification by the Drosophila melanogaster zinc finger proteins elbow and no ocelli,24625735,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004210,"The elbow/no ocelli (elb/noc) complex of Drosophila melanogaster encodes two paralogs of the evolutionarily conserved NET family of zinc finger proteins. These transcriptional repressors share a conserved domain structure, including a single atypical C2H2 zinc finger. In flies, Elb and Noc are important for the development of legs, eyes and tracheae. Vertebrate NET proteins play an important role in the developing nervous system, and mutations in the homolog ZNF703 human promote luminal breast cancer. However, their interaction with transcriptional regulators is incompletely understood. Here we show that loss of both Elb and Noc causes mis-specification of polarization-sensitive photoreceptors in the 'dorsal rim area' (DRA) of the fly retina. This phenotype is identical to the loss of the homeodomain transcription factor Homothorax (Hth)/dMeis. Development of DRA ommatidia and expression of Hth are induced by the Wingless/Wnt pathway. Our data suggest that Elb/Noc genetically interact with Hth, and we identify two conserved domains crucial for this function. Furthermore, we show that Elb/Noc specifically interact with the transcription factor Orthodenticle (Otd)/Otx, a crucial regulator of rhodopsin gene transcription. Interestingly, different Elb/Noc domains are required to antagonize Otd functions in transcriptional activation, versus transcriptional repression. We propose that similar interactions between vertebrate NET proteins and Meis and Otx factors might play a role in development and disease.",2014,"Mathias F Wernet, Kerstin M Meier, Franziska Baumann-Klausener, Ruslan Dorfman, Ulrich Weihe, Thomas Labhart, Claude Desplan, Mathias F Wernet, Kerstin M Meier, Franziska Baumann-Klausener, Ruslan Dorfman, Ulrich Weihe, Thomas Labhart, Claude Desplan"

Here, we demonstrate that the TLR Tollo positively regulates growth of the Drosophila melanogaster larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Tollo mutants exhibited NMJ undergrowth, whereas increased expression of Tollo led to NMJ overgrowth. Tollo expression in the motoneuron was both necessary and sufficient for regulating NMJ growth. Dominant genetic interactions together with altered levels of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and puc-lacZ expression revealed that Tollo signals through the JNK pathway at the NMJ. Genetic interactions also revealed that the neurotrophin SpÃ¤tzle3 (Spz3) is a likely Tollo ligand. Spz3 expression in muscle and proteolytic activation via the Easter protease was necessary and sufficient to promote NMJ growth.

Optogenetic control of Drosophila using a red-shifted channelrhodopsin reveals experience-dependent influences on courtship,24363022,10.1038/nmeth.2765,"Optogenetics allows the manipulation of neural activity in freely moving animals with millisecond precision, but its application in Drosophila melanogaster has been limited.

This tool affords the opportunity to control neural activity over a broad dynamic range of stimulation intensities. Using time-resolved activation, we show that the neural control of male courtship song can be separated into (i) probabilistic, persistent and (ii) deterministic, command-like components. The former, but not the latter, neurons are subject to functional modulation by social experience, which supports the idea that they constitute a locus of state-dependent influence.

Expression of a new beta tubulin subunit is induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone in Drosophila cultured cells,3080985,10.1016/0006-291x(86)90546-2,"One polypeptide, P4, of molecular weight 55000 daltons and pHi, 5,1, is synthesized in Drosophila melanogaster Kc 0% cells only when they were treated by the insect moulting hormone, 20 hydroxyecdysone (20-HE). P4 is precipitated with vinblastine sulfate and migrates as a tubulin subunit. Immunoblot experiment confirms that P4 is a beta subunit of tubulin. This beta tubulin is recovered by in vitro translation only when mRNAs are extracted from treated cells.

The molecular through ecological genetics of abnormal abdomen. II. Ribosomal DNA polymorphism is associated with the abnormal abdomen syndrome in Drosophila mercatorum,3007282,,"Restriction endonuclease cleavage analyses of cloned and genomic DNA samples indicate that the structure of the DNA encoding the large cytoplasmic RNAs (rDNAs) is altered in Drosophila mercatorum lines which exhibit an abnormal abdomen (aa) phenotype. In a majority of the rDNA repeat units from aa flies, the 28S coding sequence is interrupted by a large [5-6 kilobase pairs (kbp)] insert. A subclone containing this inserted DNA (ins 3) hybridizes primarily to rDNA-containing sequences in in situ and genomic blot hybridization experiments. Additionally, genomic nitrocellulose blot hybridization analyses show that ins- containing rDNA repeat units are clustered in a spontaneously arising aa mutant. This rDNA alteration in D. mercatorum flies with the aa phenotype more closely resembles the bobbed (bb) defect of D. hydei than the bb defect of D. melanogaster, which involves alterations in rDNA copy number. By analogy with the other Drosophila systems, we propose that the altered D. mercatorum rDNA repeat units are defective in rRNA production at a critical stage. The lowered levels of rRNA ultimately would limit the concentration of ribosomes needed to produce large quantities of a protein (in these cases, juvenile hormone esterase) needed for normal development.",1986,"R DeSalle, J Slightom, E Zimmer, R DeSalle, J Slightom, E Zimmer"
Ultrastructure of capitate projections in the optic neuropil of Diptera,3098431,10.1007/BF00215187,"Photoreceptor axons in the first optic neuropil of the dipteran flies Musca domestica and Drosophila melanogaster was examined with electron microscopy. The objective was to determine ultrastructure, persistence and glial source of the capitate projections found within these neurons. Capitate projections are simple or compound processes of epithelial glial cells which profusely insert into form-fitting folds of axon terminals of the peripheral retinular cells (R1-6) in the synaptic plexus portion of the first optic neuropil. These neuro-glial junctions may be simple indentations, have a head with a single stalk, or possess a single, circular stalk from which 3 or 4 bulbous (glial) heads are elaborated. Using serial thick sections of Drosophila neuropil for HVEM we were able to observe that the stalks connecting nearly all capitate projections led directly to a glial cell. Thus no disembodied heads were found suspended in axoplasm. Capitate projections appeared to be persistent structures, present in young as well as senescent adults. No evolution of form was found; thus 3 distinct expressions of these glial processes (without transitional forms) are present. From freeze-fracture replicas and serial HVEM sections it was determined that there were approximately 3 capitate projections per micron 2 in Drosophila and Musca, respectively. About 800 capitate projections exist per Musca axon terminal or about 5 times the number of chemical synapses. Cp's were slightly larger in Drosophila than in Musca, although the Musca retinular axon has twice the diameter and length of that of the fruit fly.

To our surprise, sal sequences appear to be conserved in the Sophophora subgenus of the Drosophila genus but not in the Drosophila subgenus. On the other hand, the segmentation and other homeotic genes are conserved in the Drosophila subgroup as well.

During embryogenesis beta 3 is restricted to and is expressed in all of the developing muscles. During pupal development beta 3 is also expressed at high levels in developing adult muscles. In addition, early in pupal development beta 3 is expressed in the imaginal discs, while at later times beta 3 is expressed in the epidermal cells of the wing blade, the optic lobe, the ovaries, and the testes. The expression of beta 3 tubulin ceases by the end of pupal development in all of these tissues except the ovaries and testes where expression persists into the adult.

Second, analysis of all our reciprocal exchanges between the two chromosomes shows a statistically significant dependence of the position of the chromosome 2 breakpoint on that of the chromosome 3 breakpoint. Thirdly, our combined cytological and genetic approach strengthens the results of previous analyses, which suggested a strong tendency for chromosomal interchanges to be of the reciprocal type in multiple-break rearrangements.

This accumulation is correlated with the 20-OH-ecdysone induced activity of puff 75B. 75B cDNA analysis indicates that the activity of puff 75B leads to the synthesis of a protein which belongs to the steroid and thyroid hormone receptor superfamily. The highest similarity of the derived 75B protein sequence was found to the DNA and ligand binding domains of human retinoic acid receptor. A study of the tissue distribution in larvae revealed that 75B mRNA is present in most, if not all 20-OH-ecdysone target tissues.

Does postzygotic isolation result from improper dosage compensation?,2503427,,"The X chromosome invariably has the largest effect on postzygotic isolation between animal species. One explanation of this pattern is that inviability and sterility result from a breakdown in the dosage compensation of X-linked genes in hybrids. In Drosophila, such breakdown could result from divergence of the genes used to assess the X/autosomal (X/A) ratio, and thus the sex, of an individual. I test this hypothesis by introducing mutant alleles of the Sex-lethal locus into Drosophila melanogaster-Drosophila simulans hybrids. These mutants ""ignore"" any perceived anomalous X/A ratio and thus can be used to ensure proper dosage compensation in hybrids. These mutants do not rescue hybrid viability or fertility, implying that postzygotic isolation in this hybridization does not result from a disruption of dosage compensation caused by divergence of the X/A counting system.",1989,"H A Orr, H A Orr"

We have found that all three hypomorphic alleles act as site-specific hotspots for recombination when heterozygous with a wild-type homolog. Recombination between the flanking markers ri and Ki is increased 6.5-10.5-fold in the presence of Tpl hypomorphic alleles. The increased recombination was found to occur between Tpl and Ki, while recombination in other adjacent regions is unchanged. The use of isogenic Tpl+ controls, and the use of flanking intervals in the mutant chromosomes allows us to rule out the interchromosomal effect as a cause. We have also observed premeiotic recombination occurring at the Tpl hypomorphic alleles in male heterozygotes. We hypothesize that transposons are responsible for both the hypomorphic phenotype and the high frequency of recombination.",1989,"D R Dorer, A C Christensen, D R Dorer, A C Christensen"
Imaginal disc-autonomous expression of a defect in sensory bristle patterning caused by the lethal(3)ecdysoneless1 (1(3)ecd1) mutation of Drosophila melanogaster,2512110,,"The temperature-sensitive mutation 1(3)ecd1 of Drosophila melanogaster is known to autonomously impair the ability of the larval prothoracic gland to produce the steroid molting hormone ecdysone in response to stimulation by the tropic neuropeptide prothoracicotropic hormone. It is shown that autonomous expression of the 1(3)ecd1 mutation in metamorphosing imaginal tissues disrupts the spatial pattern of sensory bristles. Transfer of homozygous mutant animals to the restrictive temperature at the time of pupariation resulted in the elimination of sensory microchaetae and macrochaetae. This effect was specific to the sensory bristles; nonsensory bristles were not eliminated, nor were other types of innervated cuticular sense organs. In the case of the dorsal thoracic macrochaetae, normal ecd gene function is required during an early period of bristle development (0-18 h after puparium formation at 20 degrees C). It is during this period that important determinative events take place in developing imaginal tissues that are responsible for the establishment of bristle progenitor cells. It is proposed that the ecd gene product may be required for the response of certain classes of cells to specific, regulatory signals.",1989,"T J Sliter, T J Sliter"
A TEST OF THE ROLE OF EPISTASIS IN DIVERGENCE UNDER UNIFORM SELECTION,28564195,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1989.tb05175.x,"Five populations of Drosophila melanogaster have previously been shown to be replicably different in their responses to artificial selection for knockdown resistance to ethanol fumes (Cohan and Hoffmann, 1986). The present study tests whether this divergence could be attributed to the epistatic mechanism assumed by Wright's shifting-balance model of evolution, in which alleles favored in the genetic background of one population are not favored in that of another. If this were the mechanism of divergence, crosses between selected lines from different populations would be expected to yield an epistatic loss of the selected phenotype. However, all such crosses showed a good fit to an additive model with dominance. Divergence by an epistatic mechanism may also be associated with epistatic variance within populations, but no evidence for such epistasis was found. The populations therefore appear to have responded in different ways to selection not because of epistasis but because knockdown-resistance alleles that were common in some populations were absent (or at least less common) in others.",1989,"Frederick M Cohan, Ary A Hoffmann, Todd W Gayley, Frederick M Cohan, Ary A Hoffmann, Todd W Gayley"
Influence of food on frequency-dependent sexual activity of Drosophila melanogaster,2508615,10.1007/BF01066255,"When two types of Drosophila are in competition, the frequency dependence of mating successes frequently is measured by direct observation of copulating pairs in ""Elens-Wattiaux"" observation chambers, the relative frequency of both types being varied. The present experiments, concerning white-ebony mutants in competition with wild-type Canton-S flies, show that the presence of food in the mating chamber influences the sexual activity of flies, this influence differing in the two types when food is present. Thus, in order to have a realistic estimation of frequency dependence, it would seem prudent to conduct these experiments with food in the chamber. Three methods are used to analyze observation data: K coefficients of Petit and Ehrman, regression equations of Ayala and Campbell, and regression equations of Wattiaux and Lichtenberger. These three methods are compared and discussed.",1989,"M Lichtenberger, J Lechien, A Elens, M Lichtenberger, J Lechien, A Elens"
Mobilization of the gypsy and copia retrotransposons in Drosophila melanogaster induces reversion of the ovo dominant female-sterile mutations: molecular analysis of revertant alleles,16453884,,"The ovo locus is required for the maintenance of the female germ line in Drosophila melanogaster. In the absence of an ovo gene, males are completely normal but females have no germ-line stem cells. Three dominant mutations at the ovo locus, called ovo, were observed to revert towards recessive alleles at high frequency when ovo males were crossed to females of the strain y v f mal. We have found that this strain contains an inordinately high number of gypsy transposable elements, and crossing it with the ovo strains results in the mobilization of both gypsy and copia, with high-frequency insertions into the ovo locus: of 16 revertants examined 12 have gypsy and four have copia inserted at 4E, the ovo cytological site. Using gypsy DNA as a tag we have cloned 32 kb of wild-type DNA sequences surrounding a gypsy insertion and characterized molecular rearrangements in several independent revertants: in 10 of them gypsy appears to be inserted into the same site. The orientation of gypsy is strictly correlated with whether the neighbouring lozenge-like mutation appears in the revertants.

Spontaneous revertants or more extreme derivatives of Om(1D) alleles were nonlinearly associated with losses or gains of tom inserts. Seven of eight radiation induced derivatives of Om(1D) mutants had one breakpoint of a chromosome rearrangement in polytene section 13A which includes the Om(1D) locus. Two Om(1D) derivatives, a spontaneous revertant and an induced extreme allele, were associated with overlapping deficiencies which define a region that is likely to contain the Om(1D) coding seguences proximal to the tom insertion sites.

In the adult male and female fly, mechanosensory bristles arranged on the external terminalia are innervated by sensory neurons that arborize in the abdominal ganglion. The distribution of axonal arbors differs between males and females. In males, sensory neurons terminate in a greater variety of patterns over a larger area of neuropil than those in females. Mutations in a sex-determining gene (transformer-2, tra-2,) which regulates the development of secondary sexual characteristics in somatic tissues, cause female flies to be transformed into phenotypic males.

The knirps enhancers exhibit additive, sometimes even super-additive activities, consistent with classical gene fusion studies. In contrast, the hunchback enhancers function sub-additively in anterior regions containing saturating levels of the Bicoid activator, but function additively in regions where there are diminishing levels of the Bicoid gradient. Strikingly sub-additive behavior is also observed for snail, whereby removal of the proximal enhancer causes a significant increase in gene expression.

"Two inwardly rectifying potassium channels, Irk1 and Irk2, play redundant roles in Drosophila renal tubule function",26224687,10.1152/ajpregu.00148.2015,"Inwardly rectifying potassium channels play essential roles in renal physiology across phyla. Barium-sensitive K(+) conductances are found on the basolateral membrane of a variety of insect Malpighian (renal) tubules, including Drosophila melanogaster. We found that barium decreases the lumen-positive transepithelial potential difference in isolated perfused Drosophila tubules and decreases fluid secretion and transepithelial K(+) flux. In those insect species in which it has been studied, transcripts from multiple genes encoding inwardly rectifying K(+) channels are expressed in the renal (Malpighian) tubule. In Drosophila melanogaster, this includes transcripts of the Irk1, Irk2, and Irk3 genes. The role of each of these gene products in renal tubule function is unknown. We found that simultaneous knockdown of Irk1 and Irk2 in the principal cell of the fly tubule decreases transepithelial K(+) flux, with no additive effect of Irk3 knockdown, and decreases barium sensitivity of transepithelial K(+) flux by ??0%. Knockdown of any of the three inwardly rectifying K(+) channels individually has no effect, nor does knocking down Irk3 simultaneously with Irk1 or Irk2. Irk1/Irk2 principal cell double-knockdown tubules remain sensitive to the kaliuretic effect of cAMP. Inhibition of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase with ouabain and Irk1/Irk2 double knockdown have additive effects on K(+) flux, and 75% of transepithelial K(+) transport is due to Irk1/Irk2 or ouabain-sensitive pathways.

The Trojan Female Technique for pest control: a candidate mitochondrial mutation confers low male fertility across diverse nuclear backgrounds in Drosophila melanogaster,26495040,10.1111/eva.12297,"Pest species represent a major ongoing threat to global biodiversity. Effective management approaches are required that regulate pest numbers, while minimizing collateral damage to nontarget species. The Trojan Female Technique (TFT) was recently proposed as a prospective approach to biological pest control. The TFT draws on the evolutionary hypothesis that maternally inherited mitochondrial genomes are prone to the accumulation of male, but not female, harming mutations. These mutations could be harnessed to provide trans-generational fertility-based control of pest species. A candidate TFT mutation was recently described in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which confers male-only sterility in the specific isogenic nuclear background in which it is maintained. However, applicability of the TFT relies on mitochondrial mutations whose male-sterilizing effects are general across nuclear genomic contexts. We test this assumption, expressing the candidate TFT-mutation bearing haplotype alongside a range of nuclear backgrounds and comparing its fertility in males, relative to that of control haplotypes. We document consistently lower fertility for males harbouring the TFT mutation, in both competitive and noncompetitive mating contexts, across all nuclear backgrounds screened. This indicates that TFT mutations conferring reduced male fertility can segregate within populations and could be harnessed to facilitate this novel form of pest control.",2015,"Damian K Dowling, Daniel M Tompkins, Neil J Gemmell, Damian K Dowling, Daniel M Tompkins, Neil J Gemmell"
Ablation of insulin-producing cells prevents obesity but not premature mortality caused by a high-sugar diet in Drosophila,25520354,10.1098/rspb.2014.1720,"Ageing can be modulated by genetic as well as nutritional interventions. In female Drosophila melanogaster, lifespan is maximized at intermediate concentrations of sucrose as the carbohydrate source, and yeast as the protein source. Dampening the signal through the insulin/IGF signalling (IIS) pathway, by genetic ablation of median neurosecretory cells (mNSCs) that produce insulin-like peptides, extends lifespan and counteracts the detrimental effects of excess yeast. However, how IIS reduction impacts health on a high-sugar diet remains unclear. We find that, while the ablation of the mNSCs can extend lifespan and delay the age-related decline in the health of the neuromuscular system irrespective of the amount of dietary sugar, it cannot rescue the lifespan-shortening effects of excess sugar. On the other hand, ablation of mNSCs can prevent adult obesity resulting from excess sugar, and this effect appears independent from the canonical effector of IIS, dfoxo. Our study indicates that while treatments that reduce IIS have anti-ageing effects irrespective of dietary sugar, additional interventions may be required to achieve full benefits in humans, where excessive sugar consumption is a growing problem. At the same time, pathways regulated by IIS may be suitable targets for treatment of obesity.",2015,"Sara Naif Al Saud, Adam C Summerfield, Nazif Alic, Sara Naif Al Saud, Adam C Summerfield, Nazif Alic"
The non-proliferative nature of ascidian folliculogenesis as a model of highly ordered cellular topology distinct from proliferative epithelia,26000769,10.1371/journal.pone.0126341,"Previous studies have addressed why and how mono-stratified epithelia adopt a polygonal topology. One major additional, and yet unanswered question is how the frequency of different cell shapes is achieved and whether the same distribution applies between non-proliferative and proliferative epithelia. We compared different proliferative and non-proliferative epithelia from a range of organisms as well as Drosophila melanogaster mutants, deficient for apoptosis or hyperproliferative. We show that the distribution of cell shapes in non-proliferative epithelia (follicular cells of five species of tunicates) is distinctly, and more stringently organized than proliferative ones (cultured epithelial cells and Drosophila melanogaster imaginal discs). The discrepancy is not supported by geometrical constraints (spherical versus flat monolayers), number of cells, or apoptosis events. We have developed a theoretical model of epithelial morphogenesis, based on the physics of divided media, that takes into account biological parameters such as cell-cell contact adhesions and tensions, cell and tissue growth, and which reproduces the effects of proliferation by increasing the topological heterogeneity observed experimentally. We therefore present a model for the morphogenesis of epithelia where, in a proliferative context, an extended distribution of cell shapes (range of 4 to 10 neighbors per cell) contrasts with the narrower range of 5-7 neighbors per cell that characterizes non proliferative epithelia.",2015,"Karim Azzag, Yoann Chelin, FranÃ§ois Rousset, Emilie Le Goff, Camille Martinand-Mari, Anne-Marie Martinez, Bernard Maurin, Martine Daujat-Chavanieu, Nelly Godefroy, Julien Averseng, Paul Mangeat, Stephen Baghdiguian, Karim Azzag, Yoann Chelin, FranÃ§ois Rousset, Emilie Le Goff, Camille Martinand-Mari, Anne-Marie Martinez, Bernard Maurin, Martine Daujat-Chavanieu, Nelly Godefroy, Julien Averseng, Paul Mangeat, Stephen Baghdiguian"
Diversity of epithelial morphogenesis during eggshell formation in drosophilids,25953345,10.1242/dev.119404,"The eggshells of drosophilid species provide a powerful model for studying the origins of morphological diversity. The dorsal appendages, or respiratory filaments, of these eggshells display a remarkable interspecies variation in number and shape, and the epithelial patterning underlying the formation of these structures is an area of active research. To extend the analysis of dorsal appendage formation to include morphogenesis, we developed an improved 3D image reconstruction approach. This approach revealed considerable interspecies variation in the cell shape changes and neighbor exchanges underlying appendage formation. Specifically, although the appendage floor in Drosophila melanogaster is formed through spatially ordered neighbor exchanges, the same structure in Scaptodrosophila pattersoni is formed through extreme changes in cell shape, whereas Drosophila funebris appears to display a combination of both cellular mechanisms. Furthermore, localization patterns of Par3/Bazooka suggest a self-organized, cell polarity-based origin for the variability of appendage number in S. pattersoni. Our results suggest that species deploy different combinations of apically and basally driven mechanisms to convert a two-dimensional primordium into a three-dimensional structure, and provide new directions for exploring the molecular origins of interspecies morphological variation.",2015,"Miriam Osterfield, Trudi SchÃ¼pbach, Eric Wieschaus, Stanislav Y Shvartsman, Miriam Osterfield, Trudi SchÃ¼pbach, Eric Wieschaus, Stanislav Y Shvartsman"

In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, germline development has been extensively studied for over a century and the breadth of our knowledge has flourished in the genomics age. Intriguingly, several peculiar phenomena that trigger catastrophic germline damage described decades ago, still endure only a partial understanding of the underlying molecular causes.

This molecular control is fundamental for both normal morphogenesis and human disease. The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is evolutionarily conserved and known to be crucial for normal cellular growth and differentiation throughout the animal kingdom.

"An inexpensive, scalable behavioral assay for measuring ethanol sedation sensitivity and rapid tolerance in Drosophila",25939022,10.3791/52676,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a serious health challenge. Despite a large hereditary component to AUD, few genes have been unambiguously implicated in their etiology. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a powerful model for exploring molecular-genetic mechanisms underlying alcohol-related behaviors and therefore holds great promise for identifying and understanding the function of genes that influence AUD. The use of the Drosophila model for these types of studies depends on the availability of assays that reliably measure behavioral responses to ethanol. This report describes an assay suitable for assessing ethanol sensitivity and rapid tolerance in flies. Ethanol sensitivity measured in this assay is influenced by the volume and concentration of ethanol used, a variety of previously reported genetic manipulations, and also the length of time the flies are housed without food immediately prior to testing. In contrast, ethanol sensitivity measured in this assay is not affected by the vigor of fly handling, sex of the flies, and supplementation of growth medium with antibiotics or live yeast. Three different methods for quantitating ethanol sensitivity are described, all leading to essentially indistinguishable ethanol sensitivity results.

We modeled the larva's navigational decision to initiate turns as the output of a Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson cascade. We used reverse-correlation to fit parameters to this model; the parameterized model predicted larvae's responses to novel stimulus patterns. For multi-modal inputs, we found that larvae linearly combine olfactory and visual signals upstream of the decision to turn. We verified this prediction by measuring larvae's responses to coordinated changes in odor and light. We studied other navigational decisions and found that larvae integrated odor and light according to the same rule in all cases.

Double nexus--Doublesex is the connecting element in sex determination,25797692,10.1093/bfgp/elv005,"In recent years, our knowledge of the conserved master-switch gene doublesex (dsx) and its function in regulating the development of dimorphic traits in insects has deepened considerably. Here, a comprehensive overview is given on the properties of the male- and female-specific dsx transcripts yielding DSX(F) and DSX(M) proteins in Drosophila melanogaster, and the many downstream targets that they regulate. As insects have cell-autonomous sex determination, it was assumed that dsx would be expressed in every somatic cell, but recent research showed that dsx is expressed only when a cell is required to show its sexual identity through function or morphology. This spatiotemporal regulation of dsx expression has not only been established in D. melanogaster but in all insect species studied. Gradually, it has been appreciated that dsx could no longer be viewed as the master-switch gene orchestrating sexual development and behaviour in each cell, but instead should be viewed as the interpreter for the sexual identity of the cell, expressing this identity only on request, making dsx the central nexus of insect sex determination.",2015,"Eveline C Verhulst, Louis van de Zande, Eveline C Verhulst, Louis van de Zande"
Lack of population differentiation patterns of previously identified putatively adaptive transposable element insertions at microgeographic scales,26463587,10.1186/s13062-015-0075-4,"Background:
      
    

    
      Transposable elements (TEs) play an important role in genome function and evolution. It has been shown that TEs are a considerable source of adaptive changes in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Specifically, footprints of selection at the DNA level, the presence of population differentiation patterns across environmental gradients, and detailed mechanistic and fitness analyses of a few candidate adaptive TEs pointed to the role of TEs in environmental adaptation. However, whether the population differentiation patterns observed at large geographic scales can be replicated at a microgeographic scale has never been assessed before.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In this work, we explored the population patterns of putatively adaptive TEs at a micro-spatial scale level. We compared the frequencies of TEs, previously identified as putatively adaptive and putatively neutral, in populations collected in opposite slopes of the Evolution Canyon at Mt. Carmel in Israel separated by 200 m on average. However, the differentiation patterns previously observed across large geographic distances (2000-2200 km) were not replicated at the microscale level of the Evolution Canyon populations.

      TE insertions previously associated with D. melanogaster environmental adaptation at a macro scale level do not play such a role at the microscale level of the Evolution Canyon populations.

Generation of New Hairless Alleles by Genomic Engineering at the Hairless Locus in Drosophila melanogaster,26448463,10.1371/journal.pone.0140007,"Hairless (H) is the major antagonist within the Notch signalling pathway of Drosophila melanogaster. By binding to Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] and two co-repressors, H induces silencing of Notch target genes in the absence of Notch signals. We have applied genomic engineering to create several new H alleles. To this end the endogenous H locus was replaced with an attP site by homologous recombination, serving as a landing platform for subsequent site directed integration of different H constructs. This way we generated a complete H knock out allele HattP, reintroduced a wild type H genomic and a cDNA-construct (Hgwt, Hcwt) as well as two constructs encoding H proteins defective of Su(H) binding (HLD, HiD). Phenotypes regarding viability, bristle and wing development were recorded, and the expression of Notch target genes wingless and cut was analysed in mutant wing discs or in mutant cell clones. Moreover, genetic interactions with Notch (N5419) and Delta (DlB2) mutants were addressed. Overall, phenotypes were largely as expected: both HLD and HiD were similar to the HattP null allele, indicating that most of H activity requires the binding of Su(H). Both rescue constructs Hgwt and Hcwt were homozygous viable without phenotype. Unexpectedly, the hemizygous condition uncovered that they were not identical to the wild type allele: notably Hcwt showed a markedly reduced activity, suggesting the presence of as yet unidentified regulatory or stabilizing elements in untranslated regions of the H gene. Interestingly, Hgwt homozygous cells expressed higher levels of H protein, perhaps unravelling gene-by-environment interactions.",2015,"Heiko Praxenthaler, Thomas K Smylla, Anja C Nagel, Anette Preiss, Dieter Maier, Heiko Praxenthaler, Thomas K Smylla, Anja C Nagel, Anette Preiss, Dieter Maier"
The homo-oligomerisation of both Sas-6 and Ana2 is required for efficient centriole assembly in flies,26002084,10.7554/eLife.07236,"Sas-6 and Ana2/STIL proteins are required for centriole duplication and the homo-oligomerisation properties of Sas-6 help establish the ninefold symmetry of the central cartwheel that initiates centriole assembly.

Here we show that the Drosophila Ana2 CCCD forms a tetramer, and we solve its structure to 0.8 ?, revealing that it adopts an unusual parallel-coil topology. We also solve the structure of the Drosophila Sas-6 N-terminal domain to 2.9 ? revealing that it forms higher-order oligomers through canonical interactions. Point mutations that perturb Sas-6 or Ana2 homo-oligomerisation in vitro strongly perturb centriole assembly in vivo. Thus, efficient centriole duplication in flies requires the homo-oligomerisation of both Sas-6 and Ana2, and the Ana2 CCCD tetramer structure provides important information on how these proteins might cooperate to form a cartwheel structure.",2015,"Matthew A Cottee, Nadine Muschalik, Steven Johnson, Joanna Leveson, Jordan W Raff, Susan M Lea, Matthew A Cottee, Nadine Muschalik, Steven Johnson, Joanna Leveson, Jordan W Raff, Susan M Lea"
Digital gene expression profiling (DGE) of cadmium-treated Drosophila melanogaster,25543212,10.1016/j.etap.2014.11.024,"Cadmium is highly toxic and can cause oxidative damage, metabolic disorders, and reduced lifespan and fertility in animals. In this study, we investigated the effects of cadmium in Drosophila melanogaster, performing transcriptome analysis by using tag-based digital gene expression (DGE) profiling. Among 1970 candidate genes, 1443 were up-regulated and 527 were down-regulated following cadmium exposure. Using Gene Ontology analysis, we found that cadmium stress affects three processes: transferase activity, stress response, and the cell cycle. Furthermore, we identified five differentially expressed genes (confirmed by real-time PCR) involved in all three processes: Ald, Cdc2, skpA, tefu, and Pvr. Pathway analysis revealed that these genes were involved in the cell cycle pathway and fat digestion and absorption pathway. This study reveals the gene expression response to cadmium stress in Drosophila, it provides insights into the mechanisms of this response, and it could contribute to our understanding of cadmium toxicity in humans.",2015,"Delong Guan, Fei Mo, Yan Han, Wei Gu, Min Zhang, Delong Guan, Fei Mo, Yan Han, Wei Gu, Min Zhang"
Paramutation in Drosophila Requires Both Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Actors of the piRNA Pathway and Induces Cis-spreading of piRNA Production,26482790,10.1534/genetics.115.180307,"Transposable element activity is repressed in the germline in animals by PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a class of small RNAs produced by genomic loci mostly composed of TE sequences. The mechanism of induction of piRNA production by these loci is still enigmatic. We have shown that, in Drosophila melanogaster, a cluster of tandemly repeated P-lacZ-white transgenes can be activated for piRNA production by maternal inheritance of a cytoplasm containing homologous piRNAs. This activated state is stably transmitted over generations and allows trans-silencing of a homologous transgenic target in the female germline. Such an epigenetic conversion displays the functional characteristics of a paramutation, i.e., a heritable epigenetic modification of one allele by the other. We report here that piRNA production and trans-silencing capacities of the paramutated cluster depend on the function of the rhino, cutoff, and zucchini genes involved in primary piRNA biogenesis in the germline, as well as on that of the aubergine gene implicated in the ping-pong piRNA amplification step. The 21-nt RNAs, which are produced by the paramutated cluster, in addition to 23- to 28-nt piRNAs are not necessary for paramutation to occur. Production of these 21-nt RNAs requires Dicer-2 but also all the piRNA genes tested. Moreover, cytoplasmic transmission of piRNAs homologous to only a subregion of the transgenic locus can generate a strong paramutated locus that produces piRNAs along the whole length of the transgenes. Finally, we observed that maternally inherited transgenic small RNAs can also impact transgene expression in the soma. In conclusion, paramutation involves both nuclear (Rhino, Cutoff) and cytoplasmic (Aubergine, Zucchini) actors of the piRNA pathway. In addition, since it is observed between nonfully homologous loci located on different chromosomes, paramutation may play a crucial role in epigenome shaping in Drosophila natural populations.",2015,"Catherine Hermant, Antoine Boivin, Laure Teysset, ValÃ©rie Delmarre, Amna Asif-Laidin, Marius van den Beek, Christophe Antoniewski, StÃ©phane Ronsseray, Catherine Hermant, Antoine Boivin, Laure Teysset, ValÃ©rie Delmarre, Amna Asif-Laidin, Marius van den Beek, Christophe Antoniewski, StÃ©phane Ronsseray"
Salt-inducible kinases mediate nutrient-sensing to link dietary sugar and tumorigenesis in Drosophila,26573956,10.7554/eLife.08501,"Cancer cells demand excessive nutrients to support their proliferation but how cancer cells sense and promote growth in the nutrient favorable conditions remain incompletely understood. Epidemiological studies have indicated that obesity is a risk factor for various types of cancers. Feeding Drosophila a high dietary sugar was previously demonstrated to not only direct metabolic defects including obesity and organismal insulin resistance, but also transform Ras/Src-activated cells into aggressive tumors. Here we demonstrate that Ras/Src-activated cells are sensitive to perturbations in the Hippo signaling pathway. We provide evidence that nutritional cues activate Salt-inducible kinase, leading to Hippo pathway downregulation in Ras/Src-activated cells. The result is Yorkie-dependent increase in Wingless signaling, a key mediator that promotes diet-enhanced Ras/Src-tumorigenesis in an otherwise insulin-resistant environment. Through this mechanism, Ras/Src-activated cells are positioned to efficiently respond to nutritional signals and ensure tumor growth upon nutrient rich condition including obesity.",2015,"Susumu Hirabayashi, Ross L Cagan, Susumu Hirabayashi, Ross L Cagan"
"Standardized extract of Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) markedly offsets rotenone-induced locomotor deficits, oxidative impairments and neurotoxicity in Drosophila melanogaster",25829577,10.1007/s13197-013-1219-0,"Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha, WS) or Indian ginseng possesses multiple pharmacological properties which are mainly attributed to the active constituents, withanolides. Despite its extensive usage as a memory enhancer and a nerve tonic, few attempts have been made to ascertain its usage in the management of Parkinson's disease. In the present study, we investigated the neuroameliorative effects of WS in a rotenone (ROT) model of Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon-K). Initially, we ascertained the ability of WS-enriched diet (0-0.05 %) to protect against ROT induced lethality and locomotor phenotype in adult male flies. Further, employing a co-exposure paradigm, we investigated the propensity of WS to offset ROT-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunctions and neurotoxicity. WS conferred significant protection against ROT-induced lethality, while the survivor flies exhibited improved locomotor phenotype. Biochemical investigations revealed that ROT-induced oxidative stress was significantly diminished by WS enrichment. WS caused significant elevation in the levels of reduced GSH/non-protein thiols. Furthermore, the altered activity levels of succinate dehydrogenase, MTT, membrane bound enzymes viz., NADH-cytochrome-c reductase and succinate-cytochrome-c reductase were markedly restored to normalcy. Interestingly, ROT-induced perturbations in cholinergic function and depletion in dopamine levels were normalized by WS. Taken together these data suggests that the neuromodulatory effect of WS against ROT- induced neurotoxicity is probably mediated via suppression of oxidative stress and its potential to attenuate mitochondrial dysfunctions. Our further studies aim to understand the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms of WS and withanolides employing neuronal cell models.",2015,"M J Manjunath, Muralidhara, M J Manjunath, Muralidhara"
Inbreeding affects locomotor activity in Drosophila melanogaster at different ages,25252771,10.1007/s10519-014-9683-5,"The ability to move is essential for many behavioural traits closely related to fitness. Here we studied the effect of inbreeding on locomotor activity (LA) of Drosophila melanogaster at different ages under both dark and light regimes. We expected to find a decreased LA in inbred lines compared to control lines. We also predicted an increased differentiation between lines due to inbreeding. LA was higher in the dark compared to the light regime for both inbred and outbred control lines. As expected, inbreeding increased phenotypic variance in LA, with some inbred lines showing higher and some lower LA than control lines. Moreover, age per se did not affect LA neither in control nor in inbred lines, while we found a strong line by age interaction between inbred lines. Interestingly, inbreeding changed the daily activity pattern of the flies: these patterns were consistent across all control lines but were lost in some inbred lines. The departure in the daily pattern of LA in inbred lines may contribute to the inbreeding depression observed in inbred natural populations.",2015,"Tommaso Manenti, Cino Pertoldi, Neda Nasiri Moghadam, Mads Fristrup Schou, Anders KjÃ¦rsgaard, Sandro Cavicchi, Volker Loeschcke, Tommaso Manenti, Cino Pertoldi, Neda Nasiri Moghadam, Mads Fristrup Schou, Anders KjÃ¦rsgaard, Sandro Cavicchi, Volker Loeschcke"
Identification of multiple dityrosine bonds in materials composed of the Drosophila protein Ultrabithorax,28725173,10.1002/adfm.201502852,"The recombinant protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx), a Drosophila melanogaster Hox transcription factor, self-assembles into biocompatible materials in vitro that are remarkably extensible and strong. Here, we demonstrate that the strength of Ubx materials is due to intermolecular dityrosine bonds. Ubx materials auto-fluoresce blue, a characteristic of dityrosine, and bind dityrosine-specific antibodies. Monitoring the fluorescence of reduced Ubx fibers upon oxygen exposure reveals biphasic bond formation kinetics. Two dityrosine bonds in Ubx were identified by site-directed mutagenesis followed by measurements of fiber fluorescent intensity. One bond is located between the N-terminus and the homeodomain (Y4/Y296 or Y12/Y293), and another bond is formed by Y167 and Y240. Fiber fluorescence closely correlates with fiber strength, demonstrating that these bonds are intermolecular. To our knowledge, this is the first identification of specific residues that participate in dityrosine bonds in protein-based materials. The percentage of Ubx molecules harboring both bonds can be decreased or increased by mutagenesis, providing an additional mechanism to control the mechanical properties of Ubx materials. Duplication of tyrosine-containing motifs in Ubx increases dityrosine content in Ubx fibers, suggesting these motifs could be inserted in other self-assembling proteins to strengthen the corresponding materials.",2015,"David W Howell, Shang-Pu Tsai, Kelly Churion, Jan Patterson, Colette Abbey, Joshua T Atkinson, Dustin Porterpan, Yil-Hwan You, Kenith E Meissner, Kayla J Bayless, Sarah E Bondos, David W Howell, Shang-Pu Tsai, Kelly Churion, Jan Patterson, Colette Abbey, Joshua T Atkinson, Dustin Porterpan, Yil-Hwan You, Kenith E Meissner, Kayla J Bayless, Sarah E Bondos"
Reverse-correlation analysis of navigation dynamics in Drosophila larva using optogenetics,25942453,10.7554/eLife.06225,"Neural circuits for behavior transform sensory inputs into motor outputs in patterns with strategic value. Determining how neurons along a sensorimotor circuit contribute to this transformation is central to understanding behavior. To do this, a quantitative framework to describe behavioral dynamics is needed. In this study, we built a high-throughput optogenetic system for Drosophila larva to quantify the sensorimotor transformations underlying navigational behavior. We express CsChrimson, a red-shifted variant of channelrhodopsin, in specific chemosensory neurons and expose large numbers of freely moving animals to random optogenetic activation patterns. We quantify their behavioral responses and use reverse-correlation analysis to uncover the linear and static nonlinear components of navigation dynamics as functions of optogenetic activation patterns of specific sensory neurons. We find that linear-nonlinear models accurately predict navigational decision-making for different optogenetic activation waveforms. We use our method to establish the valence and dynamics of navigation driven by optogenetic activation of different combinations of bitter-sensing gustatory neurons. Our method captures the dynamics of optogenetically induced behavior in compact, quantitative transformations that can be used to characterize circuits for sensorimotor processing and their contribution to navigational decision making.",2015,"Luis Hernandez-Nunez, Jonas Belina, Mason Klein, Guangwei Si, Lindsey Claus, John R Carlson, Aravinthan Dt Samuel, Luis Hernandez-Nunez, Jonas Belina, Mason Klein, Guangwei Si, Lindsey Claus, John R Carlson, Aravinthan Dt Samuel"
The Ran Pathway in Drosophila melanogaster Mitosis,26636083,10.3389/fcell.2015.00074,"Over the last two decades, the small GTPase Ran has emerged as a central regulator of both mitosis and meiosis, particularly in the generation, maintenance, and regulation of the microtubule (MT)-based bipolar spindle. Ran-regulated pathways in mitosis bear many similarities to the well-characterized functions of Ran in nuclear transport and, as with transport, the majority of these mitotic effects are mediated through affecting the physical interaction between karyopherins and Spindle Assembly Factors (SAFs)-a loose term describing proteins or protein complexes involved in spindle assembly through promoting nucleation, stabilization, and/or depolymerization of MTs, through anchoring MTs to specific structures such as centrosomes, chromatin or kinetochores, or through sliding MTs along each other to generate the force required to achieve bipolarity. As such, the Ran-mediated pathway represents a crucial functional module within the wider spindle assembly landscape. Research into mitosis using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster has contributed substantially to our understanding of centrosome and spindle function. However, in comparison to mammalian systems, very little is known about the contribution of Ran-mediated pathways in Drosophila mitosis. This article sets out to summarize our understanding of the roles of the Ran pathway components in Drosophila mitosis, focusing on the syncytial blastoderm embryo, arguing that it can provide important insights into the conserved functions on Ran during spindle formation.",2015,"Jack W C Chen, Amy R Barker, James G Wakefield, Jack W C Chen, Amy R Barker, James G Wakefield"
Dietary protein:carbohydrate balance is a critical modulator of lifespan and reproduction in Drosophila melanogaster: a test using a chemically defined diet,25728576,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2015.02.007,"Macronutrient balance is an important determinant of fitness in many animals, including insects. Previous studies have shown that altering the concentrations of yeast and sugar in the semi-synthetic media has a profound impact on lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting that dietary protein:carbohydrate (P:C) balance is the main driver of lifespan and ageing processes. However, since yeast is rich in multiple nutrients other than proteins, this lifespan-determining role of dietary P:C balance needs to be further substantiated through trials using a chemically-defined, synthetic diet. In the present study, the effects of dietary P:C balance on lifespan and fecundity were investigated in female D. melanogaster flies fed on one of eight isocaloric synthetic diets differing in P:C ratio (0:1, 1:16, 1:8, 1:4, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1 or 4:1). Lifespan and dietary P:C ratio were related in a convex manner, with lifespan increasing to a peak at the two intermediate P:C ratios (1:2 and 1:4) and falling at the imbalanced ratios (0:1 and 4:1). Ingesting nutritionally imbalanced diets not only caused an earlier onset of senescence but also accelerated the age-dependent increase in mortality. Egg production was suppressed when flies were fed on a protein-deficient food (0:1), but increased with increasing dietary P:C ratio. Long-lived flies at the intermediate P:C ratios (1:2 and 1:4) stored a greater amount of lipids than those short-lived ones at the two imbalanced ratios (0:1 and 4:1). These findings provide a strong support to the notion that adequate dietary P:C balance is crucial for extending lifespan in D. melanogaster and offer new insights into how dietary P:C balance affects lifespan and ageing through its impacts on body composition.",2015,"Kwang Pum Lee, Kwang Pum Lee"
Increased H??efflux is sufficient to induce dysplasia and necessary for viability with oncogene expression,25793441,10.7554/eLife.03270,"Intracellular pH (pHi) dynamics is increasingly recognized as an important regulator of a range of normal and pathological cell behaviors. Notably, increased pHi is now acknowledged as a conserved characteristic of cancers and in cell models is confirmed to increase proliferation and migration as well as limit apoptosis. However, the significance of increased pHi for cancer in vivo remains unresolved. Using Drosophila melanogaster, we show that increased pHi is sufficient to induce dysplasia in the absence of other transforming cues and potentiates growth and invasion with oncogenic Ras. Using a genetically encoded biosensor we also confirm increased pHi in situ. Moreover, in Drosophila models and clonal human mammary cells we show that limiting H(+) efflux with oncogenic Raf or Ras induces acidosis and synthetic lethality. Further, we show lethality in invasive primary tumor cell lines with inhibiting H(+) efflux. Synthetic lethality with reduced H(+) efflux and activated oncogene expression could be exploited therapeutically to restrain cancer progression while limiting off-target effects.",2015,"Bree K Grillo-Hill, Changhoon Choi, Maite Jimenez-Vidal, Diane L Barber, Bree K Grillo-Hill, Changhoon Choi, Maite Jimenez-Vidal, Diane L Barber"

Electrophysiology and imaging can be applied in behaving individuals to examine the computations performed by each neuron, and even the entire population of relevant neurons in a particular region, because of the small size of the brain. Moreover, a rich repertoire of behaviors that can be studied is expanding to include those requiring cognitive abilities. Thus, the fly brain is an attractive system in which to explore both computations and mechanisms underlying behavior at levels spanning from genes through neurons to circuits.

A subsequent simultaneous expansion of HD determinants and P elements occurred. We analyzed the current distribution of HD determinants in natural populations of D. melanogaster and found no evidence of their further spread. However, full-sized P elements were identified in the genomes of all analyzed natural D. melanogaster strains independent of their cytotypes. Thus, the expansion of P elements does not correlate with the expansion of HD determinants. We found that the ovaries of dysgenic females did not contain germ cells despite the equal number of primordial germ cells in early stages in dysgenic and non-dysgenic embryos.

Here, we investigate molecular evolution of a subset of Drosophila mojavensis and Drosophila arizonae reproductive tract genes. These include genes that are transcriptionally regulated by conspecific mating in females, many of which are misregulated in heterospecific crosses, and a set of male genes whose transcripts are transferred to females during mating. As a group, misregulated female genes are not more divergent and do not appear to evolve under different selection pressures than other female reproductive genes. Male transferred genes evolve at a higher rate than testis-expressed genes, and at a similar rate compared to accessory gland protein genes, which are known to evolve rapidly. Four of the individual male transferred genes show patterns of divergent positive selection between D. mojavensis and D. arizonae. Three of the four genes belong to the sperm-coating protein-like family, including an ortholog of antares, which influences female fertility and receptivity in Drosophila melanogaster.

Oral administration of CNFs at a concentration of 1,000 Î¼g/mL had adverse effects on fly physiology. Long-term administration of a high dose of CNFs (1,000 Î¼g/mL) reduced larval viability based on the pupa:egg ratio, adult fly lifespan, reproductive activity, climbing activity, and survival rate in response to starvation stress. However, CNFs at a low concentration (100 Î¼g/mL) did not show any significant deleterious effect on developmental rate or fecundity. Furthermore, long-term administration of a low dose of CNFs (100 Î¼g/mL) increased lifespan and climbing ability, coincident with mild reactive oxygen species generation and stimulation of the antioxidant system.

There is also evidence for inversion breakpoint reuse at different time scales. Here, we have characterized the breakpoints of two inversions of D. subobscura -O4 and O8- involved in complex arrangements that are frequent in the warm parts of the species distribution area. The duplications detected at their breakpoints are consistent with their origin through the staggered-break mechanism, which further supports it as the prevalent mechanism in D. subobscura.

Here, we use two approaches to investigate natural variation in D. melanogaster NaCl tolerance. We describe four D. melanogaster lines that were selected for different degrees of NaCl tolerance, and present data on their survival, development, and pupation position when raised on varying NaCl concentrations. After finding evidence for natural variation in salt tolerance, we present the results of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping of natural variation in larval and pupal NaCl tolerance, and identify different genomic regions associated with NaCl tolerance during larval and pupal development.",2016,"Craig A L Riedl, Sara Oster, Macarena Busto, Trudy F C Mackay, Marla B Sokolowski"

Shared and distinct mechanisms of atonal regulation in Drosophila ocelli and compound eyes,27565023,10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.08.025,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has two types of external visual organs, a pair of compound eyes and a group of three ocelli. At the time of neurogenesis, the proneural transcription factor Atonal mediates the transition from progenitor cells to differentiating photoreceptor neurons in both organs. In the developing compound eye, atonal (ato) expression is directly induced by transcriptional regulators that confer retinal identity, the Retinal Determination (RD) factors. Little is known, however, about control of ato transcription in the ocelli. Here we show that a 2kb genomic DNA fragment contains distinct and common regulatory elements necessary for ato induction in compound eyes and ocelli. The three binding sites that mediate direct regulation by the RD factors Sine oculis and Eyeless in the compound eye are also required in the ocelli. However, in the latter, these sites mediate control by Sine oculis and the other Pax6 factor of Drosophila, Twin of eyeless, which can bind the Pax6 sites in vitro. Moreover, the three sites are differentially utilized in the ocelli: all three are similarly essential for atonal induction in the posterior ocelli, but show considerable redundancy in the anterior ocellus. Strikingly, this difference parallels the distinct control of ato transcription in the posterior and anterior progenitors of the developing compound eyes. From a comparative perspective, our findings suggest that the ocelli of arthropods may have originated through spatial partitioning from the dorsal edge of an ancestral compound eye.",2016,"Qingxiang Zhou, Dana F DeSantis, Markus Friedrich, Francesca Pignoni, Qingxiang Zhou, Dana F DeSantis, Markus Friedrich, Francesca Pignoni"

Oviposition preferences for ethanol depend on spatial arrangement and differ dramatically among closely related Drosophila species,27694106,10.1242/bio.019380,"Recent work on the model fly Drosophila melanogaster has reported inconsistencies in their preference for laying eggs on intermediate concentrations of ethanol. In this study, we resolve this discrepancy by showing that this species strongly prefers ovipositing on ethanol when it is close to a non-ethanol substrate, but strongly avoids ethanol when options are farther apart. We also show fluidity of these behaviors among other Drosophila species: D. melanogaster is more responsive to ethanol than close relatives in that it prefers ethanol more than other species in the close-proximity case, but avoids ethanol more than other species in the distant case. In the close-proximity scenario, the more ethanol-tolerant species generally prefer ethanol more, with the exception of the island endemic D. santomea This species has the lowest tolerance in the clade, but behaves like D. melanogaster We speculate that this could be an adaptation to protect eggs from parasites or predators such as parasitoid wasps, as larvae migrate to non-toxic substrates after hatching. These natural differences among species are an excellent opportunity to study how genes and brains evolve to alter ethanol preferences, and provide an interesting model for genetic variation in preferences in other organisms, including humans.",2016,"Matt Sumethasorn, Thomas L Turner, Matt Sumethasorn, Thomas L Turner"
Neural clocks and Neuropeptide F/Y regulate circadian gene expression in a peripheral metabolic tissue,27077948,10.7554/eLife.13552,"Metabolic homeostasis requires coordination between circadian clocks in different tissues. Also, systemic signals appear to be required for some transcriptional rhythms in the mammalian liver and the Drosophila fat body. Here we show that free-running oscillations of the fat body clock require clock function in the PDF-positive cells of the fly brain. Interestingly, rhythmic expression of the cytochrome P450 transcripts, sex-specific enzyme 1 (sxe1) and Cyp6a21, which cycle in the fat body independently of the local clock, depends upon clocks in neurons expressing neuropeptide F (NPF). NPF signaling itself is required to drive cycling of sxe1 and Cyp6a21 in the fat body, and its mammalian ortholog, Npy, functions similarly to regulate cycling of cytochrome P450 genes in the mouse liver. These data highlight the importance of neuronal clocks for peripheral rhythms, particularly in a specific detoxification pathway, and identify a novel and conserved role for NPF/Npy in circadian rhythms.",2016,"Renske Erion, Anna N King, Gang Wu, John B Hogenesch, Amita Sehgal, Renske Erion, Anna N King, Gang Wu, John B Hogenesch, Amita Sehgal"
Selection on Inversion Breakpoints Favors Proximity to Pairing Sensitive Sites in Drosophila melanogaster,27343234,10.1534/genetics.116.190389,"Chromosomal inversions are widespread among taxa, and have been implicated in a number of biological processes including adaptation, sex chromosome evolution, and segregation distortion. Consistent with selection favoring linkage between loci, it is well established that length is a selected trait of inversions. However, the factors that affect the distribution of inversion breakpoints remain poorly understood. ""Sensitive sites"" have been mapped on all euchromatic chromosome arms in Drosophila melanogaster, and may be a source of natural selection on inversion breakpoint positions. Briefly, sensitive sites are genomic regions wherein proximal structural rearrangements result in large reductions in local recombination rates in heterozygotes. Here, I show that breakpoints of common inversions are significantly more likely to lie within a cytological band containing a sensitive site than are breakpoints of rare inversions. Furthermore, common inversions for which neither breakpoint intersects a sensitive site are significantly longer than rare inversions, but common inversions whose breakpoints intersect a sensitive site show no evidence for increased length. I interpret these results to mean that selection favors inversions whose breakpoints disrupt synteny near to sensitive sites, possibly because these inversions suppress recombination in large genomic regions. To my knowledge this is the first evidence consistent with positive selection acting on inversion breakpoint positions.",2016,"Russell B Corbett-Detig, Russell B Corbett-Detig"
The Role of Lipid Competition for Endosymbiont-Mediated Protection against Parasitoid Wasps in Drosophila,27406568,10.1128/mBio.01006-16,"Insects commonly harbor facultative bacterial endosymbionts, such as Wolbachia and Spiroplasma species, that are vertically transmitted from mothers to their offspring. These endosymbiontic bacteria increase their propagation by manipulating host reproduction or by protecting their hosts against natural enemies. While an increasing number of studies have reported endosymbiont-mediated protection, little is known about the mechanisms underlying this protection. Here, we analyze the mechanisms underlying protection from parasitoid wasps in Drosophila melanogaster mediated by its facultative endosymbiont Spiroplasma poulsonii Our results indicate that S. poulsonii exerts protection against two distantly related wasp species, Leptopilina boulardi and Asobara tabida S. poulsonii-mediated protection against parasitoid wasps takes place at the pupal stage and is not associated with an increased cellular immune response. In this work, we provide three important observations that support the notion that S. poulsonii bacteria and wasp larvae compete for host lipids and that this competition underlies symbiont-mediated protection. First, lipid quantification shows that both S. poulsonii and parasitoid wasps deplete D. melanogaster hemolymph lipids. Second, the depletion of hemolymphatic lipids using the Lpp RNA interference (Lpp RNAi) construct reduces wasp success in larvae that are not infected with S. poulsonii and blocks S. poulsonii growth. Third, we show that the growth of S. poulsonii bacteria is not affected by the presence of the wasps, indicating that when S. poulsonii is present, larval wasps will develop in a lipid-depleted environment. We propose that competition for host lipids may be relevant to endosymbiont-mediated protection in other systems and could explain the broad spectrum of protection provided.

      Virtually all insects, including crop pests and disease vectors, harbor facultative bacterial endosymbionts. They are vertically transmitted from mothers to their offspring, and some protect their host against pathogens. Here, we studied the mechanism of protection against parasitoid wasps mediated by the Drosophila melanogaster endosymbiont Spiroplasma poulsonii Using genetic manipulation of the host, we provide strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that competition for host lipids underlies S. poulsonii-mediated protection against parasitoid wasps. We propose that lipid competition-based protection may not be restricted to Spiroplasma bacteria but could also apply other endosymbionts, notably Wolbachia bacteria, which can suppress human disease-causing viruses in insect hosts.",2016,"Juan C Paredes, Jeremy K Herren, Fanny SchÃ¼pfer, Bruno Lemaitre, Juan C Paredes, Jeremy K Herren, Fanny SchÃ¼pfer, Bruno Lemaitre"
The Insulin-Like Proteins dILPs-2/5 Determine Diapause Inducibility in Drosophila,27689881,10.1371/journal.pone.0163680,"Diapause is an actively induced dormancy that has evolved in Metazoa to resist environmental stresses. In temperate regions, many diapausing insects overwinter at low temperatures by blocking embryonic, larval or adult development. Despite its Afro-tropical origin, Drosophila melanogaster migrated to temperate regions of Asia and Europe where females overwinter as adults by arresting gonadal development (reproductive diapause) at temperatures <13Â°C. Recent work in D. melanogaster has implicated the developmental hormones dILPs-2 and/or dILP3, and dILP5, homologues of vertebrate insulin/insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), in reproductive arrest. However, polymorphisms in timeless (tim) and couch potato (cpo) dramatically affect diapause inducibility and these dILP experiments could not exclude this common genetic variation contributing to the diapause phenotype. Here, we apply an extensive genetic dissection of the insulin signaling pathway which allows us to see both enhancements and reductions in egg development that are independent of tim and cpo variations. We show that a number of manipulations dramatically enhance diapause to ~100%. These include ablating, or reducing the excitability of the insulin-producing cells (IPCs) that express dILPs-2,3,5 employing the dilp2,3,5-/- triple mutant, desensitizing insulin signaling using a chico mutation, or inhibiting dILP2 and 5 in the hemolymph by over-expressing Imaginal Morphogenesis Protein-Late 2 (Imp-L2). In addition, triple mutant dilp2,3,5-/- females maintain high levels of diapause even when temperatures are raised in adulthood to 19Â°C. However at 22Â°C, these females all show egg development revealing that the effects are conditional on temperature and not a general female sterility. In contrast, over-expression of dilps-2/5 or enhancing IPC excitability, led to levels of ovarian arrest that approached zero, underscoring dILPs-2 and 5 as key antagonists of diapause.",2016,"Luca Schiesari, Gabriele Andreatta, Charalambos P Kyriacou, Michael B O'Connor, Rodolfo Costa, Luca Schiesari, Gabriele Andreatta, Charalambos P Kyriacou, Michael B O'Connor, Rodolfo Costa"
Dynamics of memory-guided choice behavior in Drosophila,27725473,10.2183/pjab.92.346,"Memory retrieval requires both accuracy and speed. Olfactory learning of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster serves as a powerful model system to identify molecular and neuronal substrates of memory and memory-guided behavior. The behavioral expression of olfactory memory has traditionally been tested as a conditioned odor response in a simple T-maze, which measures the result, but not the speed, of odor choice. Here, we developed multiplexed T-mazes that allow video recording of the choice behavior. Automatic fly counting in each arm of the maze visualizes choice dynamics. Using this setup, we show that the transient blockade of serotonergic neurons slows down the choice, while leaving the eventual choice intact. In contrast, activation of the same neurons impairs the eventual performance leaving the choice speed unchanged. Our new apparatus contributes to elucidating how the speed and the accuracy of memory retrieval are implemented in the fly brain.",2016,"Toshiharu Ichinose, Hiromu Tanimoto, Toshiharu Ichinose, Hiromu Tanimoto"
Rapid divergence and convergence of life-history in experimentally evolved Drosophila melanogaster,27431916,10.1111/evo.13006,"Laboratory selection experiments are alluring in their simplicity, power, and ability to inform us about how evolution works. A longstanding challenge facing evolution experiments with metazoans is that significant generational turnover takes a long time. In this work, we present data from a unique system of experimentally evolved laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster that have experienced three distinct life-history selection regimes. The goal of our study was to determine how quickly populations of a certain selection regime diverge phenotypically from their ancestors, and how quickly they converge with independently derived populations that share a selection regime. Our results indicate that phenotypic divergence from an ancestral population occurs rapidly, within dozens of generations, regardless of that population's evolutionary history. Similarly, populations sharing a selection treatment converge on common phenotypes in this same time frame, regardless of selection pressures those populations may have experienced in the past. These patterns of convergence and divergence emerged much faster than expected, suggesting that intermediate evolutionary history has transient effects in this system.

The pdm3 Locus Is a Hotspot for Recurrent Evolution of Female-Limited Color Dimorphism in Drosophila,27546577,10.1016/j.cub.2016.07.016,"Sex-limited polymorphisms are an intriguing form of sexual dimorphism that offer unique opportunities to reconstruct the evolutionary changes that decouple male and female traits encoded by a shared genome. We investigated the genetic basis of a Mendelian female-limited color dimorphism (FLCD) that segregates in natural populations of more than 20 species of the Drosophila montium subgroup. In these species, females have alternative abdominal color morphs, light and dark, whereas males have only one color morph in each species. A comprehensive molecular phylogeny of the montium subgroup supports multiple origins of FLCD. Despite this, we mapped FLCD to the same locus in four distantly related species-the transcription factor POU domain motif 3 (pdm3), which acts as a repressor of abdominal pigmentation in D. melanogaster. In D. serrata, FLCD maps to a structural variant in the first intron of pdm3; however, this variant is not found in the three other species-D. kikkawai, D. leontia, and D. burlai-and sequence analysis strongly suggests the pdm3 alleles responsible for FLCD originated independently at least three times. We propose that cis-regulatory changes in pdm3 form sexually dimorphic and monomorphic alleles that segregate within species and are preserved, at least in one species, by structural variation. Surprisingly, pdm3 has not been implicated in the evolution of sex-specific pigmentation outside the montium subgroup, suggesting that the genetic paths to sexual dimorphism may be constrained within a clade but variable across clades.",2016,"Amir Yassin, Emily K Delaney, Adam J Reddiex, Thaddeus D Seher, HÃ©loÃ¯se Bastide, Nicholas C Appleton, Justin B Lack, Jean R David, Stephen F Chenoweth, John E Pool, Artyom Kopp, Amir Yassin, Emily K Delaney, Adam J Reddiex, Thaddeus D Seher, HÃ©loÃ¯se Bastide, Nicholas C Appleton, Justin B Lack, Jean R David, Stephen F Chenoweth, John E Pool, Artyom Kopp"
Blastoderm segmentation in Oncopeltus fasciatus and the evolution of insect segmentation mechanisms,27708151,10.1098/rspb.2016.1745,"Segments are formed simultaneously in the blastoderm of the fly Drosophila melanogaster through a hierarchical cascade of interacting transcription factors. Conversely, in many insects and in all non-insect arthropods most segments are formed sequentially from the posterior. We have looked at segmentation in the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus. Posterior segments are formed sequentially, through what is probably the ancestral arthropod mechanism. Formation of anterior segments bears many similarities to the Drosophila segmentation mode. These segments appear nearly simultaneously in the blastoderm, via a segmentation cascade that involves orthologues of Drosophila gap genes working through a functionally similar mechanism. We suggest that simultaneous blastoderm segmentation evolved at or close to the origin of holometabolous insects, and formed the basis for the evolution of the segmentation mode seen in Drosophila We discuss the changes in segmentation mechanisms throughout insect evolution, and suggest that the appearance of simultaneous segmentation as a novel feature of holometabolous insects may have contributed to the phenomenal success of this group.",2016,"Reut Stahi, Ariel D Chipman, Reut Stahi, Ariel D Chipman"

The consequences of alternative splicing on the phenotype are well documented, but the impact of the environment on alternative splicing is not yet clear. We studied variation in alternative splicing among four different temperatures, 13, 18, 23, and 29Â°, in two Drosophila melanogaster genotypes. We show plasticity of alternative splicing with up to 10% of the expressed genes being differentially spliced between the most extreme temperatures for a given genotype. Comparing the two genotypes at different temperatures, we found <1% of the genes being differentially spliced at 18Â°. At extreme temperatures, however, we detected substantial differences in alternative splicing-with almost 10% of the genes having differential splicing between the genotypes: a magnitude similar to between species differences. Genes with differential alternative splicing between genotypes frequently exhibit dominant inheritance. Remarkably, the pattern of surplus of differences in alternative splicing at extreme temperatures resembled the pattern seen for gene expression intensity. Since different sets of genes were involved for the two phenotypes, we propose that purifying selection results in the reduction of differences at benign temperatures. Relaxed purifying selection at temperature extremes, on the other hand, may cause the divergence in gene expression and alternative splicing between the two strains in rarely encountered environments.",2016,"Ana Marija JakÅ¡i?, Christian SchlÃ¶tterer, Ana Marija JakÅ¡i?, Christian SchlÃ¶tterer"

Our results show how the specificity of one RBP (Pum) is modulated by cooperative RNA recognition with a second RBP (Nos) to synergistically repress mRNAs. Crystal structures of Nos-Pum-RNA complexes reveal that Nos embraces Pum and RNA, contributes sequence-specific contacts, and increases Pum RNA-binding affinity. Nos shifts the recognition sequence and promotes repression complex formation on mRNAs that are not stably bound by Pum alone, explaining the preponderance of sub-optimal Pum sites regulated in vivo.

Bcl-2 homologue Debcl enhances Î±-synuclein-induced phenotypes in Drosophila,27672511,10.7717/peerj.2461,"Background:
      
    

    
      Parkinson disease (PD) is a debilitating movement disorder that afflicts 1-2% of the population over 50 years of age. The common hallmark for both sporadic and familial forms of PD is mitochondrial dysfunction. Mammals have at least twenty proapoptotic and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, in contrast, only two Bcl-2 family genes have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster, the proapoptotic mitochondrial localized Debcl and the antiapoptotic Buffy. The expression of the human transgene Î±-synuclein, a gene that is strongly associated with inherited forms of PD, in dopaminergic neurons (DA) of Drosophila, results in loss of neurons and locomotor dysfunction to model PD in flies. The altered expression of Debcl in the DA neurons and neuron-rich eye and along with the expression of Î±-synuclein offers an opportunity to highlight the role of Debcl in mitochondrial-dependent neuronal degeneration and death.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The directed overexpression of Debcl using the Ddc-Gal4 transgene in the DA of Drosophila resulted in flies with severely decreased survival and a premature age-dependent loss in climbing ability. The inhibition of Debcl resulted in enhanced survival and improved climbing ability whereas the overexpression of Debcl in the Î±-synuclein-induced Drosophila model of PD resulted in more severe phenotypes. In addition, the co-expression of Debcl along with Buffy partially counteracts the Debcl-induced phenotypes, to improve the lifespan and the associated loss of locomotor ability observed. In complementary experiments, the overexpression of Debcl along with the expression of Î±-synuclein in the eye, enhanced the eye ablation that results from the overexpression of Debcl. The co-expression of Buffy along with Debcl overexpression results in the rescue of the moderate developmental eye defects. The co-expression of Buffy along with inhibition of Debcl partially restores the eye to a roughened eye phenotype.
    

    
  


        Discussion:
      
    

    
      The overexpression of Debcl in DA neurons produces flies with shortened lifespan and impaired locomotor ability, phenotypes that are strongly associated with models of PD in Drosophila. The co-expression of Debcl along with Î±-synuclein enhanced the PD-like phenotypes. The co-expression of Debcl along with Buffy suppresses these phenotypes. Complementary experiments in the Drosophila eye show similar trends during development. Taken all together these results suggest a role for Debcl in neurodegenerative disorders.",2016,"P Githure M'Angale, Brian E Staveley, P Githure M'Angale, Brian E Staveley"

An emerging hypothesis postulates that reduced GABAergic inhibition of excitatory neurons is a key component in the pathophysiology of FXS. Here, we directly test this idea in a FXS Drosophila model. We show that FXS flies exhibit strongly impaired olfactory behaviors. In line with this, olfactory representations are less odor specific due to broader response tuning of excitatory projection neurons. We find that impaired inhibitory interactions underlie reduced specificity in olfactory computations. Finally, we show that defective lateral inhibition across projection neurons is caused by weaker inhibition from GABAergic interneurons. We provide direct evidence that deficient inhibition impairs sensory computations and behavior in an in vivo model of FXS. Together with evidence of impaired inhibition in autism and Rett syndrome, these findings suggest a potentially general mechanism for intellectual disability.",2017,"Luis M Franco, Zeynep Okray, Gerit A Linneweber, Bassem A Hassan, Emre Yaksi, Luis M Franco, Zeynep Okray, Gerit A Linneweber, Bassem A Hassan, Emre Yaksi"

To test the effect of the physical mating environment on purging, we use experimental evolution in Drosophila melanogaster to track the frequency of four separate deleterious mutations in replicate populations that experience polygamy under either a simple or structurally complex mating arena while controlling for arena size. Consistent with past results suggesting a greater net benefit of polygamy in a complex environment, two of the mutations were purged significantly faster in this environment.

SIK3-HDAC4 signaling regulates Drosophila circadian male sex drive rhythm via modulating the DN1 clock neurons,28743754,10.1073/pnas.1620483114,"The physiology and behavior of many organisms are subject to daily cycles. In Drosophila melanogaster the daily locomotion patterns of single flies are characterized by bursts of activity at dawn and dusk. Two distinct clusters of clock neurons-morning oscillators (M cells) and evening oscillators (E cells)-are largely responsible for these activity bursts. In contrast, male-female pairs of flies follow a distinct pattern, most notably characterized by an activity trough at dusk followed by a high level of male courtship during the night. This male sex drive rhythm (MSDR) is mediated by the M cells along with DN1 neurons, a cluster of clock neurons located in the dorsal posterior region of the brain. Here we report that males lacking Salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) expression in M cells exhibit a short period of MSDR but a long period of single-fly locomotor rhythm (SLR). Moreover, lack of Sik3 in M cells decreases the amplitude of PERIOD (PER) cycling in DN1 neurons, suggesting that SIK3 non-cell-autonomously regulates DN1 neurons' molecular clock. We also show that Sik3 reduction interferes with circadian nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), a SIK3 phosphorylation target, in clock neurons and that constitutive HDAC4 localization in the nucleus shortens the period of MSDR. Taking these findings together, we conclude that SIK3-HDAC4 signaling in M cells regulates MSDR by regulating the molecular oscillation in DN1 neurons.",2017,"Shinsuke Fujii, Patrick Emery, Hubert Amrein, Shinsuke Fujii, Patrick Emery, Hubert Amrein"
"A Kinome RNAi Screen in Drosophila Identifies Novel Genes Interacting with Lgl, aPKC, and Crb Cell Polarity Genes in Epithelial Tissues",28611255,10.1534/g3.117.043513,"In both Drosophila melanogaster and mammalian systems, epithelial structure and underlying cell polarity are essential for proper tissue morphogenesis and organ growth. Cell polarity interfaces with multiple cellular processes that are regulated by the phosphorylation status of large protein networks. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that coordinate cell polarity with tissue growth, we screened a boutique collection of RNAi stocks targeting the kinome for their capacity to modify Drosophila ""cell polarity"" eye and wing phenotypes. Initially, we identified kinase or phosphatase genes whose depletion modified adult eye phenotypes associated with the manipulation of cell polarity complexes (via overexpression of Crb or aPKC). We next conducted a secondary screen to test whether these cell polarity modifiers altered tissue overgrowth associated with depletion of Lgl in the wing. These screens identified Hippo, Jun kinase (JNK), and Notch signaling pathways, previously linked to cell polarity regulation of tissue growth. Furthermore, novel pathways not previously connected to cell polarity regulation of tissue growth were identified, including Wingless (Wg/Wnt), Ras, and lipid/Phospho-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways. Additionally, we demonstrated that the ""nutrient sensing"" kinases Salt Inducible Kinase 2 and 3 (SIK2 and 3) are potent modifiers of cell polarity phenotypes and regulators of tissue growth. Overall, our screen has revealed novel cell polarity-interacting kinases and phosphatases that affect tissue growth, providing a platform for investigating molecular mechanisms coordinating cell polarity and tissue growth during development.",2017,"Linda M Parsons, Nicola A Grzeschik, Kasun Amaratunga, Peter Burke, Leonie M Quinn, Helena E Richardson, Linda M Parsons, Nicola A Grzeschik, Kasun Amaratunga, Peter Burke, Leonie M Quinn, Helena E Richardson"
Molecular basis of fatty acid taste in Drosophila,29231818,10.7554/eLife.30115,"Behavioral studies have established that Drosophila appetitive taste responses towards fatty acids are mediated by sweet sensing Gustatory Receptor Neurons (GRNs). Here we show that sweet GRN activation requires the function of the Ionotropic Receptor genes IR25a, IR76b and IR56d. The former two IR genes are expressed in several neurons per sensillum, while IR56d expression is restricted to sweet GRNs. Importantly, loss of appetitive behavioral responses to fatty acids in IR25a and IR76b mutant flies can be completely rescued by expression of respective transgenes in sweet GRNs. Interestingly, appetitive behavioral responses of wild type flies to hexanoic acid reach a plateau at ~1%, but decrease with higher concentration, a property mediated through IR25a/IR76b independent activation of bitter GRNs. With our previous report on sour taste, our studies suggest that IR-based receptors mediate different taste qualities through cell-type specific IR subunits.",2017,"Ji-Eun Ahn, Yan Chen, Hubert Amrein, Ji-Eun Ahn, Yan Chen, Hubert Amrein"
Evolution of the metabolome in response to selection for increased immunity in populations of Drosophila melanogaster,29149207,10.1371/journal.pone.0188089,"We used NMR-based metabolomics to test two hypotheses-(i) there will be evolved differences in the metabolome of selected and control populations even under un-infected conditions and (ii) post infection, the metabolomes of the selected and control populations will respond differently. We selected replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster for increased survivorship (I) against a gram-negative pathogen. We subjected the selected (I) and their control populations (S) to three different treatments: (1) infected with heat-killed bacteria (i), (2) sham infected (s), and (3) untreated (u). We performed 1D and 2D NMR experiments to identify the metabolic differences. Multivariate analysis of the metabolic profiles of the untreated (Iu and Su) flies yielded higher concentrations of lipids, organic acids, sugars, amino acids, NAD and AMP in the Iu treatment as compared to the Su treatment, showing that even in the absence of infection, the metabolome of the I and S regimes was different. In the S and I regimes, post infection/injury, concentration of metabolites directly or indirectly associated with energy related pathways (lipids, organic acids, sugars) declined while the concentration of metabolites that are probably associated with immune response (amino acids) increased. However, in most cases, the I regime flies had a higher concentration of such metabolites even under un-infected conditions. The change in the metabolite concentration upon infection/injury was not always comparable between I and S regimes (in case of lactate, alanine, leucine, lysine, threonine) indicating that the I and S regimes had evolved to respond differentially to infection and to injury.",2017,"Navdeep Gogna, Rakesh Sharma, Vanika Gupta, Kavita Dorai, N G Prasad, Navdeep Gogna, Rakesh Sharma, Vanika Gupta, Kavita Dorai, N G Prasad"
"Expression of a Drosophila glutathione transferase in Arabidopsis confers the ability to detoxify the environmental pollutant, and explosive, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene",27924627,10.1111/nph.14326,"The explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) is a significant, global environmental pollutant that is both toxic and recalcitrant to degradation. Given the sheer scale and inaccessible nature of contaminated areas, phytoremediation may be a viable clean-up approach. Here, we have characterized a Drosophila melanogaster glutathione transferase (DmGSTE6) which has activity towards TNT. Recombinantly expressed, purified DmGSTE6 produces predominantly 2-glutathionyl-4,6-dinitrotoluene, and has a 2.5-fold higher Maximal Velocity (Vmax ), and five-fold lower Michaelis Constant (Km ) than previously characterized TNT-active Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) GSTs. Expression of DmGSTE6 in Arabidopsis conferred enhanced resistance to TNT, and increased the ability to remove TNT from contaminated soil relative to wild-type plants. Arabidopsis lines overexpressing TNT-active GSTs AtGST-U24 and AtGST-U25 were compromised in biomass production when grown in the absence of TNT. This yield drag was not observed in the DmGSTE6-expressing Arabidopsis lines. We hypothesize that increased levels of endogenous TNT-active GSTs catalyse excessive glutathionylation of endogenous substrates, depleting glutathione pools, an activity that DmGST may lack. In conclusion, DmGSTE6 has activity towards TNT, producing a compound with potential for further biodegradation. Selecting or manipulating plants to confer DmGSTE6-like activity could contribute towards development of phytoremediation strategies to clean up TNT from polluted military sites.",2017,"Kyriakos Tzafestas, Maria M Razalan, Ivan Gyulev, Aslam M A Mazari, Bengt Mannervik, Elizabeth L Rylott, Neil C Bruce, Kyriakos Tzafestas, Maria M Razalan, Ivan Gyulev, Aslam M A Mazari, Bengt Mannervik, Elizabeth L Rylott, Neil C Bruce"
Methods for studying the metabolic basis of Drosophila development,28556549,10.1002/wdev.280,"The field of metabolic research has experienced an unexpected renaissance. While this renewed interest in metabolism largely originated in response to the global increase in diabetes and obesity, studies of metabolic regulation now represent the frontier of many biomedical fields. This trend is especially apparent in developmental biology, where metabolism influences processes ranging from stem cell differentiation and tissue growth to sexual maturation and reproduction. In this regard, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a powerful tool for dissecting conserved mechanisms that underlie developmental metabolism, often with a level of detail that is simply not possible in other animals. Here we describe why the fly is an ideal system for exploring the relationship between metabolism and development, and outline a basic experimental strategy for conducting these studies.

Uncoupling apical constriction from tissue invagination,28263180,10.7554/eLife.22235,"Apical constriction is a widely utilized cell shape change linked to folding, bending and invagination of polarized epithelia. It remains unclear how apical constriction is regulated spatiotemporally during tissue invagination and how this cellular process contributes to tube formation in different developmental contexts. Using Drosophila salivary gland (SG) invagination as a model, we show that regulation of folded gastrulation expression by the Fork head transcription factor is required for apicomedial accumulation of Rho kinase and non-muscle myosin II, which coordinate apical constriction. We demonstrate that neither loss of spatially coordinated apical constriction nor its complete blockage prevent internalization and tube formation, although such manipulations affect the geometry of invagination. When apical constriction is disrupted, compressing force generated by a tissue-level myosin cable contributes to SG invagination. We demonstrate that fully elongated polarized SGs can form outside the embryo, suggesting that tube formation and elongation are intrinsic properties of the SG.",2017,"SeYeon Chung, Sangjoon Kim, Deborah J Andrew, SeYeon Chung, Sangjoon Kim, Deborah J Andrew"
Efficient Screening of CRISPR/Cas9-Induced Events in Drosophila Using a Co-CRISPR Strategy,27793971,10.1534/g3.116.036723,"Genome editing using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and associated nuclease (Cas9) enables specific genetic modifications, including deletions, insertions, and substitutions in numerous organisms, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster One challenge of the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be the laborious and time-consuming screening required to find CRISPR-induced modifications due to a lack of an obvious phenotype and low frequency after editing. Here we apply the successful co-CRISPR technique in Drosophila to simultaneously target a gene of interest and a marker gene, ebony, which is a recessive gene that produces dark body color and has the further advantage of not being a commonly used transgenic marker. We found that Drosophila broods containing higher numbers of CRISPR-induced ebony mutations (""jackpot"" lines) are significantly enriched for indel events in a separate gene of interest, while broods with few or no ebony offspring showed few mutations in the gene of interest. Using two different PAM sites in our gene of interest, we report that ??1% (52-70%) of flies from the ebony-enriched broods had an indel in DNA near either PAM site. Furthermore, this marker mutation system may be useful in detecting the less frequent homology-directed repair events, all of which occurred in the ebony-enriched broods. By focusing on the broods with a significant number of ebony flies, successful identification of CRISPR-induced events is much faster and more efficient.

The glycosylation pathway is required for the secretion of Slit and for the maintenance of the Slit receptor Robo on axons,28634210,10.1126/scisignal.aam5841,"Slit proteins act as repulsive axon guidance cues by activating receptors of the Roundabout (Robo) family. During early neurogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, Slit prevents the growth cones of longitudinal tract neurons from inappropriately crossing the midline, thus restricting these cells to trajectories parallel to the midline. Slit is expressed in midline glial cells, and Robo is present in longitudinal axon tracts and growth cones. We showed that the enzyme Mummy (Mmy) controlled Slit-Robo signaling through mechanisms that affected both the ligand and the receptor. Mmy was required for the glycosylation of Slit, which was essential for Slit secretion. Mmy was also required for maintaining the abundance and spatial distribution of Robo through an indirect mechanism that was independent of Slit secretion. Moreover, secretion of Slit was required to maintain the fasciculation and position of longitudinal axon tracts, thus maintaining the hardwiring of the nervous system. Thus, Mmy is required for Slit secretion and for maintaining Robo abundance and distribution in the developing nervous system in Drosophila.",2017,"Mary Ann Manavalan, Vatsala Ruvini Jayasinghe, Rickinder Grewal, Krishna Moorthi Bhat, Mary Ann Manavalan, Vatsala Ruvini Jayasinghe, Rickinder Grewal, Krishna Moorthi Bhat"

On the other hand, behaviors preventing an extensive contact with the microbes and thus reducing the risk of infection have been described. However, these reactions ranging from microbes aversion to intestinal transit increase or food intake decrease have been rarely defined at the molecular level. In this study, we set up an experimental system that allowed us to rapidly identify and quantify food intake decreases in Drosophila larvae exposed to media contaminated with bacteria. Specifically, we report a robust dose-dependent food intake decrease following exposure to the bacteria Erwinia carotovora carotovora strain Ecc15. We demonstrate that this response does not require Imd innate immune pathway, but rather the olfactory neuronal circuitry, the Trpa1 receptor and the evf virulence factor.

Dietary consumption of monosodium L-glutamate induces adaptive response and reduction in the life span of Drosophila melanogaster,28303588,10.1002/cbf.3259,"Adaptive response is the ability of an organism to better counterattack stress-induced damage in response to a number of different cytotoxic agents. Monosodium L-glutamate (MSG), the sodium salt of amino acid glutamate, is commonly used as a food additive. We investigated the effects of MSG on the life span and antioxidant response in Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster). Both genders (1 to 3 days old) of flies were fed with diet containing MSG (0.1, 0.5, and 2.5-g/kg diet) for 5 days to assess selected antioxidant and oxidative stress markers, while flies for longevity were fed for lifetime. Thereafter, the longevity assay, hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species levels were determined. Also, catalase, glutathione S-transferase and acetylcholinesterase activities, and total thiol content were evaluated in the flies. We found that MSG reduced the life span of the flies by up to 23% after continuous exposure. Also, MSG increased reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and H2 O2 generations and total thiol content as well as the activities of catalase and glutathione S-transferase in D. melanogaster (P < .05). In conclusion, consumption of MSG for 5 days by D. melanogaster induced adaptive response, but long-term exposure reduced life span of flies.

Neuroligins Nlg2 and Nlg4 Affect Social Behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,28740469,10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00113,"The genome of Drosophila melanogaster includes homologs to approximately one-third of the currently known human disease genes. Flies and humans share many biological processes, including the principles of information processing by excitable neurons, synaptic transmission, and the chemical signals involved in intercellular communication. Studies on the molecular and behavioral impact of genetic risk factors of human neuro-developmental disorders [autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, and Tourette syndrome] increasingly use the well-studied social behavior of D. melanogaster, an organism that is amenable to a large variety of genetic manipulations. Neuroligins (Nlgs) are a family of phylogenetically conserved postsynaptic adhesion molecules present (among others) in nematodes, insects, and mammals. Impaired function of Nlgs (particularly of Nlg 3 and 4) has been associated with ASDs in humans and impaired social and communication behavior in mice. Making use of a set of behavioral and social assays, we, here, analyzed the impact of two Drosophila Nlgs, Dnlg2 and Dnlg4, which are differentially expressed at excitatory and inhibitory central nervous synapses, respectively. Both Nlgs seem to be associated with diurnal activity and social behavior.

A 'phenotypic hangover': the predictive adaptive response and multigenerational effects of altered nutrition on the transcriptome of Drosophila melanogaster,29492318,10.1093/eep/dvx019,"The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease hypothesis predicts that early-life environmental exposures can be detrimental to later-life health and that mismatch between the pre- and post-natal environment may contribute to the growing non-communicable disease epidemic. Within this is an increasingly recognized role for epigenetic mechanisms; for example, epigenetic modifications can be influenced by nutrition and can alter gene expression in mothers and offspring. Currently, there are few whole-genome transcriptional studies of response to nutritional alteration. Thus, we sought to explore how nutrition affects the expression of genes involved in epigenetic processes in Drosophila melanogaster. We manipulated Drosophila food macronutrient composition at the F0 generation, mismatched F1 offspring back to a standard diet and analysed the transcriptome of the F0-F3 generations by RNA sequencing. At F0, the altered (high-protein, low-carbohydrate) diet increased expression of genes classified as having roles in epigenetic processes, with co-ordinated down-regulation of genes involved in immunity, neurotransmission and neurodevelopment, oxidative stress and metabolism. Upon reversion to standard nutrition, mismatched F1 and F2 generations displayed multigenerational inheritance of altered gene expression. By the F3 generation, gene expression had reverted to F0 (matched) levels. These nutritionally induced gene expression changes demonstrate that dietary alterations can up-regulate epigenetic genes, which may influence the expression of genes with broad biological functions. Furthermore, the multigenerational inheritance of the gene expression changes in F1 and F2 mismatched generations suggests a predictive adaptive response to maternal nutrition, aiding the understanding of the interaction between maternal diet and offspring health, with direct implications for the current non-communicable disease epidemic.",2017,"Amy J Osborne, Peter K Dearden, Amy J Osborne, Peter K Dearden"
The neurogenetics of group behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,28057826,10.1242/jeb.141457,"Organisms rarely act in isolation. Their decisions and movements are often heavily influenced by direct and indirect interactions with conspecifics. For example, we each represent a single node within a social network of family and friends, and an even larger network of strangers. This group membership can affect our opinions and actions. Similarly, when in a crowd, we often coordinate our movements with others like fish in a school, or birds in a flock. Contributions of the group to individual behaviors are observed across a wide variety of taxa but their biological mechanisms remain largely unknown. With the advent of powerful computational tools as well as the unparalleled genetic accessibility and surprisingly rich social life of Drosophila melanogaster, researchers now have a unique opportunity to investigate molecular and neuronal determinants of group behavior. Conserved mechanisms and/or selective pressures in D. melanogaster can likely inform a much wider phylogenetic scale. Here, we highlight two examples to illustrate how quantitative and genetic tools can be combined to uncover mechanisms of two group behaviors in D. melanogaster: social network formation and collective behavior. Lastly, we discuss future challenges towards a full understanding how coordinated brain activity across many individuals gives rise to the behavioral patterns of animal societies.",2017,"Pavan Ramdya, Jonathan Schneider, Joel D Levine"
Transcriptome Profiling of Neurosensory Perception Genes in Wing Tissue of Two Evolutionary Distant Insect Orders: Diptera (Drosophila melanogaster) and Hemiptera (Acyrthosiphon pisum),29075833,10.1007/s00239-017-9814-8,"The neurogenesis and neuronal functions in insect wing have been understudied mainly due to technical hindrances that have prevented electrophysiology studies for decades. The reason is that the nano-architecture of the wing chemosensory bristles hampers the receptors accessibility of odorants/tastants to receptors in fixed setup, whereas in nature, the wing flapping mixes these molecules in bristle lymph. In this report, we analyzed the transcriptome of the wing tissue of two species phylogenetically strongly divergent: Drosophila melanogaster a generic model for diptera order (complete metamorphosis) and the aphid acyrthosiphon pisum, representative of hemiptera order (incomplete metamorphosis) for which a conditional winged/wingless polyphenism is under control of population density and resources. The transcriptome shows that extensive gene networks involved in chemosensory perception are active in adult wing for both species. Surprisingly, the specific transcripts of genes that are commonly found in eye were present in Drosophila wing but not in aphid. The analysis reveals that in the aphid conditional wing, expressed genes show strong similarities with those in the gut epithelia. This suggests that the epithelial cell layer between the cuticle sheets is persistent at least in young aphid adult, whereas it disappears after emergence in Drosophila. Despite marked differences between the two transcriptomes, the results highlight the probable universalism of wing chemosensory function in the holometabolous and hemimetabolous orders of winged insects.",2017,"Sandra Agnel, Martine da Rocha, Alain Robichon, Sandra Agnel, Martine da Rocha, Alain Robichon"
Optical Quantification of Intracellular pH in Drosophila melanogaster Malpighian Tubule Epithelia with a Fluorescent Genetically-encoded pH Indicator,28829430,10.3791/55698,"Epithelial ion transport is vital to systemic ion homeostasis as well as maintenance of essential cellular electrochemical gradients. Intracellular pH (pHi) is influenced by many ion transporters and thus monitoring pHi is a useful tool for assessing transporter activity. Modern Genetically Encoded pH-Indicators (GEpHIs) provide optical quantification of pHi in intact cells on a cellular and subcellular scale. This protocol describes real-time quantification of cellular pHi regulation in Malpighian Tubules (MTs) of Drosophila melanogaster through ex vivo live-imaging of pHerry, a pseudo-ratiometric GEpHI with a pKa well-suited to track pH changes in the cytosol. Extracted adult fly MTs are composed of morphologically and functionally distinct sections of single-cell layer epithelia, and can serve as an accessible and genetically tractable model for investigation of epithelial transport. GEpHIs offer several advantages over conventional pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes and ion-selective electrodes. GEpHIs can label distinct cell populations provided appropriate promoter elements are available. This labeling is particularly useful in ex vivo, in vivo, and in situ preparations, which are inherently heterogeneous. GEpHIs also permit quantification of pHi in intact tissues over time without need for repeated dye treatment or tissue externalization. The primary drawback of current GEpHIs is the tendency to aggregate in cytosolic inclusions in response to tissue damage and construct over-expression. These shortcomings, their solutions, and the inherent advantages of GEpHIs are demonstrated in this protocol through assessment of basolateral proton (H+) transport in functionally distinct principal and stellate cells of extracted fly MTs. The techniques and analysis described are readily adaptable to a wide variety of vertebrate and invertebrate preparations, and the sophistication of the assay can be scaled from teaching labs to intricate determination of ion flux via specific transporters.",2017,"Adam J Rossano, Michael F Romero, Adam J Rossano, Michael F Romero"

The homologous genes from two related Drosophila species (D. erecta and D. yakuba) have been introduced into the D. melanogaster genome by P-factor-mediated transformation. When the resulting transformant lines were assayed for expression of the introduced genes, near-normal patterns of expression were seen. This demonstrates that the cis-acting regulatory sequences of the introduced Sgs-3-homologous glue genes are capable of interacting effectively with the transcriptional machinery of D. melanogaster. We have also determined the sequences of the Sgs-3-homologous glue genes from D. simulans, D. erecta and D. yakuba. These sequences were compared and used in two ways. The first was to locate conserved sequence elements in regions known to be involved in regulation of the gene. Several such elements were found; they represent potential sites of cis-acting regulatory sequences. Second, we looked at the evolution of the glue gene protein-coding regions. A very rapidly evolving central region of the protein-coding sequences was found; this region contains a striking series of tandem repeats of a five amino acid residue sequence in all four species.

To analyze the regulation of the alcohol dehydrogenase genes from these two species, their homologous alcohol dehydrogenase genes were cloned and introduced, via P element-mediated transformation, into the germ line of Drosophila melanogaster. Histochemical and electrophoretic analyses of larval transformants demonstrate that major differences in the tissue-specific levels of alcohol dehydrogenase production are characteristic of the alcohol dehydrogenase genes themselves.

Epigenetic factors Polycomb (Pc) and Suppressor of zeste (Su(z)2) negatively regulate longevity in Drosophila melanogaster,29177687,10.1007/s10522-017-9737-1,"The process of aging is a hallmark of the natural life span of all organisms and individuals within a population show variability in the measures of age related performance. Longevity and the rate of aging are influenced by several factors such as genetics, nutrition, stress, and environment. Many studies have focused on the genes that impact aging and there is increasing evidence that epigenetic factors regulate these genes to control life span. Polycomb (PcG) and trithorax (trxG) protein complexes maintain the expression profiles of developmentally important genes and regulate many cellular processes. Here, we report that mutations of PcG and trxG members affect the process of aging in Drosophila melanogaster, with perturbations mostly associated with retardation in aging. We find that mutations in polycomb repressive complex (PRC1) components Pc and Su(z)2 increase fly survival. Using an inducible UAS-GAL4 system, we show that this effect is tissue-specific; knockdown in fat body, but not in muscle or brain tissues, enhances life span. We hypothesize that these two proteins influence life span via pathways independent of their PRC1 functions, with distinct effects on response to oxidative stress.

"Comparative analysis of FKBP family protein: evaluation, structure, and function in mammals and Drosophila melanogaster",29587629,10.1186/s12861-018-0167-3,"Background:
      
    

    
      FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs) have become the subject of considerable interest in several fields, leading to the identification of several cellular and molecular pathways in which FKBPs impact prenatal development and pathogenesis of many human diseases.
    

    
  


        Main body:
      
    

    
      This analysis revealed differences between how mammalian and Drosophila FKBPs mechanisms function in relation to the immunosuppressant drugs, FK506 and rapamycin. Differences that could be used to design insect-specific pesticides. (1) Molecular phylogenetic analysis of FKBP family proteins revealed that the eight known Drosophila FKBPs share homology with the human FKBP12. This indicates a close evolutionary relationship, and possible origination from a common ancestor. (2) The known FKBPs contain FK domains, that is, a prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) domain that mediates immune suppression through inhibition of calcineurin. The dFKBP59, CG4735/Shutdown, CG1847, and CG5482 have a Tetratricopeptide receptor domain at the C-terminus, which regulates transcription and protein transportation. (3) FKBP51 and FKBP52 (dFKBP59), along with Cyclophilin 40 and protein phosphatase 5, function as Hsp90 immunophilin co-chaperones within steroid receptor-Hsp90 heterocomplexes. These immunophilins are potential drug targets in pathways associated with normal physiology and may be used to treat a variety of steroid-based diseases by targeting exocytic/endocytic cycling and vesicular trafficking. (4) By associating with presinilin, a critical component of the Notch signaling pathway, FKBP14 is a downstream effector of Notch activation at the membrane. Meanwhile, Shutdown associates with transposons in the PIWI-interacting RNA pathway, playing a crucial role in both germ cells and ovarian somas. Mutations in or silencing of dFKBPs lead to early embryonic lethality in Drosophila. Therefore, further understanding the mechanisms of FK506 and rapamycin binding to immunophilin FKBPs in endocrine, cardiovascular, and neurological function in both mammals and Drosophila would provide prospects in generating unique, insect specific therapeutics targeting the above cellular signaling pathways.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:

The Drosophila junctophilin gene is functionally equivalent to its four mammalian counterparts and is a modifier of a Huntingtin poly-Q expansion and the Notch pathway,29208631,10.1242/dmm.029082,"Members of the Junctophilin (JPH) protein family have emerged as key actors in all excitable cells, with crucial implications for human pathophysiology. In mammals, this family consists of four members (JPH1-JPH4) that are differentially expressed throughout excitable cells. The analysis of knockout mice lacking JPH subtypes has demonstrated their essential contribution to physiological functions in skeletal and cardiac muscles and in neurons. Moreover, mutations in the human JPH2 gene are associated with hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies; mutations in JPH3 are responsible for the neurodegenerative Huntington's disease-like-2 (HDL2), whereas JPH1 acts as a genetic modifier in Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2K peripheral neuropathy. Drosophila melanogaster has a single junctophilin (jp) gene, as is the case in all invertebrates, which might retain equivalent functions of the four homologous JPH genes present in mammalian genomes. Therefore, owing to the lack of putatively redundant genes, a jpDrosophila model could provide an excellent platform to model the Junctophilin-related diseases, to discover the ancestral functions of the JPH proteins and to reveal new pathways. By up- and downregulation of Jp in a tissue-specific manner in Drosophila, we show that altering its levels of expression produces a phenotypic spectrum characterized by muscular deficits, dilated cardiomyopathy and neuronal alterations. Importantly, our study has demonstrated that Jp modifies the neuronal degeneration in a Drosophila model of Huntington's disease, and it has allowed us to uncover an unsuspected functional relationship with the Notch pathway. Therefore, this Drosophila model has revealed new aspects of Junctophilin function that can be relevant for the disease mechanisms of their human counterparts.",2018,"Eduardo Calpena, VÃ­ctor LÃ³pez Del Amo, Mouli Chakraborty, Beatriz LlamusÃ­, RubÃ©n Artero, Carmen EspinÃ³s, MÃ¡ximo I Galindo, Eduardo Calpena, VÃ­ctor LÃ³pez Del Amo, Mouli Chakraborty, Beatriz LlamusÃ­, RubÃ©n Artero, Carmen EspinÃ³s, MÃ¡ximo I Galindo"
Mechanisms of Non-canonical Signaling in Health and Disease: Diversity to Take Therapy up a Notch?,30030827,10.1007/978-3-319-89512-3_9,"Non-canonical Notch signaling encompasses a wide range of cellular processes, diverging considerably from the established paradigm. It can dispense of ligand, proteolytic or nuclear activity. Non-canonical Notch signaling events have been studied mostly in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the organism in which Notch was identified first and a powerful model for understanding signaling outcomes. However, non-canonical events are ill-defined and their involvement in human physiology is not clear, hampering our understanding of diseases arising from Notch signaling alterations. At a time in which therapies based on specific targeting of Notch signaling are still an unfulfilled promise, detailed understanding of non-canonical Notch events might be key to devising more specific and less toxic pharmacologic options. Based on the blueprint of non-canonical signaling in Drosophila, here, we review and rationalize current evidence about non-canonical Notch signaling. Our effort might inform Notch biologists developing new research avenues and clinicians seeking future treatment of Notch-dependent diseases.",2018,"Victor Alfred, Thomas Vaccari, Victor Alfred, Thomas Vaccari"
Drosophila as a Model System to Study Cell Signaling in Organ Regeneration,29750169,10.1155/2018/7359267,"Regeneration is a fascinating phenomenon that allows organisms to replace or repair damaged organs or tissues. This ability occurs to varying extents among metazoans. The rebuilding of the damaged structure depends on regenerative proliferation that must be accompanied by proper cell fate respecification and patterning. These cellular processes are regulated by the action of different signaling pathways that are activated in response to the damage. The imaginal discs of Drosophila melanogaster have the ability to regenerate and have been extensively used as a model system to study regeneration. Drosophila provides an opportunity to use powerful genetic tools to address fundamental problems about the genetic mechanisms involved in organ regeneration. Different studies in Drosophila have helped to elucidate the genes and signaling pathways that initiate regeneration, promote regenerative growth, and induce cell fate respecification. Here we review the signaling networks involved in regulating the variety of cellular responses that are required for discs regeneration.",2018,"Sara Ahmed-de-Prado, Antonio Baonza, Sara Ahmed-de-Prado, Antonio Baonza"
Drosophila melanogaster as a Model for Diabetes Type 2 Progression,29854726,10.1155/2018/1417528,"Drosophila melanogaster has been used as a very versatile and potent model in the past few years for studies in metabolism and metabolic disorders, including diabetes types 1 and 2. Drosophila insulin signaling, despite having seven insulin-like peptides with partially redundant functions, is very similar to the human insulin pathway and has served to study many different aspects of diabetes and the diabetic state. Yet, very few studies have addressed the chronic nature of diabetes, key for understanding the full-blown disease, which most studies normally explore. One of the advantages of having Drosophila mutant viable combinations at different levels of the insulin pathway, with significantly reduced insulin pathway signaling, is that the abnormal metabolic state can be studied from the onset of the life cycle and followed throughout. In this review, we look at the chronic nature of impaired insulin signaling.

The Fly Way of Antiviral Resistance and Disease Tolerance,30366519,10.1016/bs.ai.2018.08.002,"Like humans, insects face the threat of viral infection. Despite having repercussions on human health and disease, knowledge gaps exist for how insects cope with viral pathogens. Drosophila melanogaster serves as an ideal insect model due to its genetic tractability. When encountering a pathogen, two major approaches to fight disease are resistance strategies and tolerance strategies. Disease resistance strategies promote the health of the infected host by reducing pathogen load. Multiple disease resistance mechanisms have been identified in Drosophila: RNA interference, Jak/STAT signaling, Toll signaling, IMD signaling, and autophagy. Disease tolerance mechanisms, in contrast, do not reduce pathogen load directly, but rather mitigate the stress and damage incurred by infection. The main benefit of tolerance mechanisms may therefore be to provide the host with time to engage antiviral resistance mechanisms that eliminate the threat. In this review, antiviral resistance mechanisms used by Drosophila will be described and compared to mammalian antiviral mechanisms. Disease tolerance will then be explained in a broader context as this is a burgeoning field of study.",2018,"Jonathan Chow, Jonathan C Kagan, Jonathan Chow, Jonathan C Kagan"
Unexpected role of the IMD pathway in Drosophila gut defense against Staphylococcus aureus,29108998,10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.11.004,"In this study, fruit fly of the genus Drosophila is utilized as a suitable model animal to investigate the molecular mechanisms of innate immunity. To combat orally transmitted pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, the Drosophila gut is armed with the peritrophic matrix, which is a physical barrier composed of chitin and glycoproteins: the Duox system that produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn sterilize infected microbes, and the IMD pathway that regulates the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which in turn control ROS-resistant pathogens. However, little is known about the defense mechanisms against Gram-positive bacteria in the fly gut. Here, we show that the peritrophic matrix protects Drosophila against Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus. We also define the few roles of ROS in response to the infection and show that the IMD pathway is required for the clearance of ingested microbes, possibly independently from AMP expression. These findings provide a new aspect of the gut defense system of Drosophila, and helps to elucidate the processes of gut-microbe symbiosis and pathogenesis.",2018,"Aki Hori, Shoichiro Kurata, Takayuki Kuraishi, Aki Hori, Shoichiro Kurata, Takayuki Kuraishi"
Renal neuroendocrine control of desiccation and cold tolerance by Drosophila suzukii,28714258,10.1002/ps.4663,"Background:
      
    

    
      Neuropeptides are central to the regulation of physiological and behavioural processes in insects, directly impacting cold and desiccation survival. However, little is known about the control mechanisms governing these responses in Drosophila suzukii. The close phylogenetic relationship of D. suzukii with Drosophila melanogaster allows, through genomic and functional studies, an insight into the mechanisms directing stress tolerance in D. suzukii.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Capability (Capa), leucokinin (LK), diuretic hormone 44 (DH44 ) and DH31 neuropeptides demonstrated a high level of conservation between D. suzukii and D. melanogaster with respect to peptide sequences, neuronal expression, receptor localisation, and diuretic function in the Malpighian tubules. Despite D. suzukii's ability to populate cold environments, it proved sensitive to both cold and desiccation. Furthermore, in D. suzukii, Capa acts as a desiccation- and cold stress-responsive gene, while DH44 gene expression is increased only after desiccation exposure, and the LK gene after nonlethal cold stress recovery.

Inverse European Latitudinal Cline at the timeless Locus of Drosophila melanogaster Reveals Selection on a Clock Gene: Population Genetics of ls-tim,29183263,10.1177/0748730417742309,"The spread of adaptive genetic variants in populations is a cornerstone of evolutionary theory but with relatively few biologically well-understood examples. Previous work on the ls-tim variant of timeless, which encodes the light-sensitive circadian regulator in Drosophila melanogaster, suggests that it may have originated in southeastern Italy. Flies characterized by the new allele show photoperiod-related phenotypes likely to be adaptive in seasonal environments. ls-tim may be spreading from its point of origin in Italy by directional selection, but there are alternative explanations for its observed clinal geographical distribution, including balancing selection and demography. From population analyses of ls-tim frequencies collected on the eastern side of the Iberian Peninsula, we show that ls-tim frequencies are inverted compared with those in Italy. This pattern is consistent with a scenario of directional selection rather than latitude-associated balancing selection. Neutrality tests further reveal the signature of directional selection at the ls-tim site, which is reduced a few kb pairs either side of ls-tim. A reanalysis of allele frequencies from a large number of microsatellite loci do not demonstrate any frequent ls-tim-like spatial patterns, so a general demographic effect or population expansion from southeastern Italy cannot readily explain current ls-tim frequencies. Finally, a revised estimate of the age of ls-tim allele using linkage disequilibrium and coalescent-based approaches reveals that it may be only 300 to 3000 years old, perhaps explaining why it has not yet gone to fixation. ls-tim thus provides a rare temporal snapshot of a new allele that has come under selection before it reaches equilibrium.",2018,"Valeria Zonato, Stefano Vanin, Rodolfo Costa, Eran Tauber, Charalambos P Kyriacou, Valeria Zonato, Stefano Vanin, Rodolfo Costa, Eran Tauber, Charalambos P Kyriacou"
Lithocholic Acid Improves the Survival of Drosophila Melanogaster,30051966,10.1002/mnfr.201800424,"Scope:
      
    

    
      Primary bile acids are produced in the liver, whereas secondary bile acids, such as lithocholic acid (LCA), are generated by gut bacteria from primary bile acids that escape the ileal absorption. Besides their well-known function as detergents in lipid digestion, bile acids are important signaling molecules mediating effects on the host's metabolism.
    

    
  


        Methods and results:
      
    

    
      Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) are supplemented with 50 Î¼mol L-1 LCA either for 30 days or throughout their lifetime. LCA supplementation results in a significant induction of the mean (+12 days), median (+10 days), and maximum lifespan (+ 11 days) in comparison to untreated control flies. This lifespan extension is accompanied by an induction of spargel (srl), the fly homolog of mammalian PPAR-Î³ co-activator 1Î± (PGC1Î±). In wild-type flies, the administration of antibiotics abrogates both the LCA-mediated lifespan induction as well as the upregulation of srl.

      It is shown that the secondary bile acid LCA significantly induces the mean, the median, and the maximum survival in D. melanogaster.

Endocytosis is entirely blocked at an early stage in Flower-deficient CTLs and is rescued to wild-type level by reintroducing Flower or by raising extracellular calcium.

Using behavioral functional screening, we pinpoint that expression of the mitochondrial reactive oxygen scavenger SOD2 in cholinergic projection neurons is necessary and sufficient to prevent smell degeneration in aging flies. Together, our data suggest that oxidative stress induced axonal degeneration in a single class of neurons drives the functional decline of an entire neural network and the behavior it controls.

Juvenile hormone reveals mosaic developmental programs in the metamorphosing optic lobe of Drosophila melanogaster,29618455,10.1242/bio.034025,"The development of the adult optic lobe (OL) of Drosophila melanogaster is directed by a wave of ingrowth of the photoreceptors over a 2-day period at the outset of metamorphosis, which is accompanied by the appearance of the pupal-specific transcription factor Broad-Z3 (Br-Z3) and expression of early drivers in OL neurons. During this time, there are pulses of ecdysteroids that time the metamorphic events. At the outset, the transient appearance of juvenile hormone (JH) prevents precocious development of the OL caused by the ecdysteroid peak that initiates pupariation, but the artificial maintenance of JH after this time misdirects subsequent development. Axon ingrowth, Br-Z3 appearance and the expression of early drivers were unaffected, but aspects of later development such as the dendritic expansion of the lamina monopolar neurons and the expression of late drivers were suppressed. This effect of the exogenous JH mimic (JHM) pyriproxifen is lost by 24 h after pupariation.

MATING PREFERENCE AND ITS RELEVANCE TO ADAPTATION IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER: INVERSION POLYMORPHISM AND DDT RESISTANCE,28561499,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1985.tb00450.x,"The importance of adult mating success as a component of fitness influencing inversion polymorphism in two DDT-resistant populations of Drosophila melanogaster was investigated. The polymorphism involved In(3R)P and the Standard (St) gene arrangement. In population 731R the St/St females showed greater mating propensity than In/In females, while in population J2 the In/In females showed a significant positive association between mating propensity and the percentage of St/St males present. Mating preference data showed that St/St males were selectively favored over In/In males in both populations. No differences were observed between St/St and St/In karyotypes in either population. Frequency-dependent mating in the form of a rare male mating disadvantage for the In/In males tested against the St/St males in 731R was observed; the St/St males in this case showed a marginally significant rare male mating advantage. Thus, mating success as well as previously measured fecundity and fertility all indicate a selective advantage of the St chromosome over the In chromosome in both populations. This fitness relationship does not predict the equilibrium condition of 70-80% St/In, 20-30% In/In, and 0-10% St/St found in the DDT environment, whereas previously collected larval viability data and estimated adult survivorship do. In at least one population (731R), the adult mating success data do predict the dynamics of the polymorphism in the absence of DDT, whereas viability does not. These results, although limited to two populations under two environments (presence or absence of DDT), suggest that the relationship between adaptation to the environment under study and various components of fitness needs to be investigated fully before assessing which fitness components are most important in determining the effects of natural selection in specific populations.",1985,"Phillip T Barnes, David J Merrell, Phillip T Barnes, David J Merrell"

Shilo and R. A. Weinberg, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78:6789-6792, 1981). We have detected Drosophila RNA sequences that also hybridize with v-myc. In an attempt to characterize these RNA sequences, we used v-myc hybridization probes to isolate Drosophila genomic segments. None of the Drosophila genomic or cDNA clones that we have isolated hybridize with the 3' exon of v-myc. Preliminary nucleotide sequence analyses have revealed sufficient homology to account for the observed hybridization between v-myc and the Drosophila clones but have failed to detect significant amino acid sequence homology. Thus is seems unlikely that the mRNA sequences or the genomic sequences that we have isolated by hybridization with v-myc represent homologs of the vertebrate myc gene. Despite the lack of structural homology between the cloned Drosophila sequences and v-myc, we have investigated the pattern of expression of those RNA species that hybridize with v-myc. Polyadenylic acid-containing transcripts of 2.7, 2.2, and 1.7 kilobases (kb) in embryos, pupae, adults, and Kc cells and an additional 1.4-kb transcript in adults were complementary to the Drosophila genomic clones and to v-myc.

The 1.7- and 2.2-kb transcripts were present after 45 min, 2 h, and 4 h of embryonic development, but by 16 h of development their levels had decreased by more than sixfold. During metamorphosis, two peaks of expression of the 1.7- and 2.2-kb transcripts were observed, at 6 and 72 h postpupariation. The 1.4-kb RNA species was first detected at 72 h postpupariation. In adults, the 1.7- and 2.2-kb transcripts were detected only in ovaries in females, whereas the 1.4-kb transcript was present in female nonovarian RNA and in males.

The authors compared effects on isoflurane induction versus recovery in syntaxin1A mutant animals by probing behavioral responses to mechanical stimuli. The authors also measured synaptic responses from the larval neuromuscular junction using sharp intracellular recordings, and performed Western blots to determine whether the truncated syntaxin1A is associated with presynaptic core complexes.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Drosophila expressing a truncated syntaxin1A (syx, n = 40) were resistant to isoflurane induction for a behavioral responsiveness endpoint (ED50 0.30 Â± 0.01% isoflurane, P < 0.001) compared with control (0.240 Â± 0.002% isoflurane, n = 40). Recovery from isoflurane anesthesia was also faster, with syx-expressing flies showing greater levels of responsiveness earlier in recovery (reaction proportion 0.66 Â± 0.48, P < 0.001, n = 68) than controls (0.22 Â± 0.42, n = 68 and 0.33 Â± 0.48, n = 66). Measuring excitatory junction potentials of larvae coexpressing the truncated syntaxin1A protein showed a greater recovery of synaptic function, compared with controls (17.39 Â± 3.19 mV and 10.29 Â± 4.88 mV, P = 0.014, n = 8 for both). The resistance-promoting truncated syntaxin1A was not associated with presynaptic core complexes, in the presence or absence of isoflurane anesthesia.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The same neomorphic syntaxin1A mutation that confers isoflurane resistance in cell culture and nematodes also produces isoflurane resistance in Drosophila. Resistance in Drosophila is, however, most evident at the level of recovery from anesthesia, suggesting that the syntaxin1A target affects anesthesia maintenance and recovery processes rather than induction. The absence of truncated syntaxin1A from the presynaptic complex suggests that the resistance-promoting effect of this molecule occurs before core complex formation.",2019,"Michael Troup, Oressia H Zalucki, Benjamin D Kottler, Shanker Karunanithi, Victor Anggono, Bruno van Swinderen, Michael Troup, Oressia H Zalucki, Benjamin D Kottler, Shanker Karunanithi, Victor Anggono, Bruno van Swinderen"
Self-regulation and the foraging gene ( PRKG1) in humans,30782798,10.1073/pnas.1809924116,"Foraging is a goal-directed behavior that balances the need to explore the environment for resources with the need to exploit those resources. In Drosophila melanogaster, distinct phenotypes have been observed in relation to the foraging gene (for), labeled the rover and sitter. Adult rovers explore their environs more extensively than do adult sitters. We explored whether this distinction would be conserved in humans. We made use of a distinction from regulatory mode theory between those who ""get on with it,"" so-called locomotors, and those who prefer to ensure they ""do the right thing,"" so-called assessors. In this logic, rovers and locomotors share similarities in goal pursuit, as do sitters and assessors. We showed that genetic variation in PRKG1, the human ortholog of for, is associated with preferential adoption of a specific regulatory mode. Next, participants performed a foraging task to see whether genetic differences associated with distinct regulatory modes would be associated with distinct goal pursuit patterns. Assessors tended to hug the boundary of the foraging environment, much like behaviors seen in Drosophila adult sitters. In a patchy foraging environment, assessors adopted more cautious search strategies maximizing exploitation. These results show that distinct patterns of goal pursuit are associated with particular genotypes of PRKG1, the human ortholog of for.",2019,"Andriy A Struk, Jhotisha Mugon, Andrea Huston, Abigail A Scholer, Gertraud Stadler, E Tory Higgins, Marla B Sokolowski, James Danckert, Andriy A Struk, Jhotisha Mugon, Andrea Huston, Abigail A Scholer, Gertraud Stadler, E Tory Higgins, Marla B Sokolowski, James Danckert"
Label-free distribution of anti-amyloid D-AIP in Drosophila melanogaster: prevention of AÎ²42-induced toxicity without side effects in transgenic flies,31077378,10.1111/jnc.14720,"Soluble oligomers of the 42-amino acid amyloid beta (AÎ²42) peptide are highly toxic and suspected as the causative agent of synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously, we have shown that a small, D-amino acid AÎ²42-oligomer interacting peptide (D-AIP) can neutralize human AÎ²42-mediated toxicity using in vitro and cell-based assays. In the present longitudinal study using a transgenic Drosophila melanogaster model, advanced live confocal imaging and mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) showed that the eight amino acid D-AIP can attenuate AÎ²42-induced toxicity in vivo. By separating male and female flies into distinct groups, the resultant distribution of ingested D-AIP was different between the sexes. The AÎ²42-induced 'rough eye' phenotype could be rescued in the female transgenics, likely because of the co-localization of D-AIP with human AÎ²42 in the female fly heads. Interestingly, the phenotype could not be rescued in the male transgenics, likely because of the co-localization of D-AIP with a confounding male-specific sex peptide (Acp70A candidate in MSI spectra) in the gut of the male flies. As a novel, more cost-effective strategy to prevent toxic amyloid formation during the early stages of AD (i.e. neutralization of toxic low-order AÎ²42 oligomers without creating larger aggregates in the process), our longitudinal study establishes that D-AIP is a stable and highly effective neutralizer of toxic AÎ²42 peptides in vivo.

The GATOR complex regulates an essential response to meiotic double-stranded breaks in Drosophila,31650955,10.7554/eLife.42149,"The TORC1 regulator GATOR1/SEACIT controls meiotic entry and early meiotic events in yeast. However, how metabolic pathways influence meiotic progression in metazoans remains poorly understood. Here we examine the role of the TORC1 regulators GATOR1 and GATOR2 in the response to meiotic double-stranded breaks (DSB) during Drosophila oogenesis. We find that in mutants of the GATOR2 component mio, meiotic DSBs trigger the constitutive downregulation of TORC1 activity and a permanent arrest in oocyte growth. Conversely, in GATOR1 mutants, high TORC1 activity results in the delayed repair of meiotic DSBs and the hyperactivation of p53. Unexpectedly, we found that GATOR1 inhibits retrotransposon expression in the presence of meiotic DSBs in a pathway that functions in parallel to p53. Thus, our studies have revealed a link between oocyte metabolism, the repair of meiotic DSBs and retrotransposon expression.",2019,"Youheng Wei, Lucia Bettedi, Chun-Yuan Ting, Kuikwon Kim, Yingbiao Zhang, Jiadong Cai, Mary A Lilly, Youheng Wei, Lucia Bettedi, Chun-Yuan Ting, Kuikwon Kim, Yingbiao Zhang, Jiadong Cai, Mary A Lilly"
A circuit-dependent ROS feedback loop mediates glutamate excitotoxicity to sculpt the Drosophila motor system,31318331,10.7554/eLife.47372,"Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is known to mediate glutamate excitotoxicity in neurological diseases. However, how ROS burdens can influence neural circuit integrity remains unclear. Here, we investigate the impact of excitotoxicity induced by depletion of Drosophila Eaat1, an astrocytic glutamate transporter, on locomotor central pattern generator (CPG) activity, neuromuscular junction architecture, and motor function. We show that glutamate excitotoxicity triggers a circuit-dependent ROS feedback loop to sculpt the motor system. Excitotoxicity initially elevates ROS, thereby inactivating cholinergic interneurons and consequently changing CPG output activity to overexcite motor neurons and muscles. Remarkably, tonic motor neuron stimulation boosts muscular ROS, gradually dampening muscle contractility to feedback-enhance ROS accumulation in the CPG circuit and subsequently exacerbate circuit dysfunction. Ultimately, excess premotor excitation of motor neurons promotes ROS-activated stress signaling that alters neuromuscular junction architecture. Collectively, our results reveal that excitotoxicity-induced ROS can perturb motor system integrity through a circuit-dependent mechanism.",2019,"Jhan-Jie Peng, Shih-Han Lin, Yu-Tzu Liu, Hsin-Chieh Lin, Tsai-Ning Li, Chi-Kuang Yao, Jhan-Jie Peng, Shih-Han Lin, Yu-Tzu Liu, Hsin-Chieh Lin, Tsai-Ning Li, Chi-Kuang Yao"

"Ilex paraguariensis Attenuates Changes in Mortality, Behavioral and Biochemical Parameters Associated to Methyl Malonate or Malonate Exposure in Drosophila melanogaster",31422521,10.1007/s11064-019-02862-w,"Methylmalonic acidemia is a genetic disease characterized by accumulation of organic acids, such as methylmalonic (MMA) and malonic (MA) acids. Considering that the accumulation of MMA and MA causes several damages due to oxidative stress, antioxidants are thought to play a pivotal role in preventing deleterious effects associated with exposure to such compounds. Ilex paraguariensis (IP) was used here to test the hypothesis that supplementation with the aqueous extract of this plant could exert protective effect against MMA or MA induced mortality, behavioral and/or biochemical changes in Drosophila melanogaster (DM). Initially, a curve time- and dose-response to MMA (1-10 mM), MA (1-10 mM) and IP (63-500 Î¼M) was performed. Thereafter, flies were concomitantly exposed to MA (5 mM), MMA (5 mM) and/or IP (250 Î¼g/mL) during 15 days for survival assay, and for 48 hs to MA (1 or 5 mM), MMA (1 or 5 mM) and/or IP (250 Î¼g/mL) for subsequent investigations. Both MMA and MA exposure resulted in higher incidence of mortality, a worse performance in the negative geotaxis assay and increased locomotion in open-field test as compared with control group. Furthermore, a marked increase in non-protein thiol (NPSH) and in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels, decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities, and decrease in MTT and resazurin reduction were noted in MMA or MA treated groups.

Emerging Mechanisms of Insulin-Mediated Antiviral Immunity in Drosophila melanogaster,31921210,10.3389/fimmu.2019.02973,"Arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses), such as Zika (ZIKV), West Nile (WNV), and dengue (DENV) virus, include some of the most significant global health risks to human populations. The steady increase in the number of cases is of great concern due to the debilitating diseases associated with each viral infection. Because these viruses all depend on the mosquito as a vector for disease transmission, current research has focused on identifying immune mechanisms used by insects to effectively harbor these viruses and cause disease in humans and other animals. Drosophila melanogaster are a vital model to study arboviral infections and host responses as they are a genetically malleable model organism for experimentation that can complement analysis in the virus' natural vectors. D. melanogaster encode a number of distinct mechanisms of antiviral defense that are found in both mosquito and vertebrate animal systems, providing a viable model for study. These pathways include canonical antiviral modules such as RNA interference (RNAi), JAK/STAT signaling, and the induction of STING-mediated immune responses like autophagy. Insulin signaling plays a significant role in host-pathogen interactions. The exact mechanisms of insulin-mediated immune responses vary with each virus type, but nevertheless ultimately demonstrates that metabolic and immune signaling are coupled for antiviral immunity in an arthropod model.

Convergent Evidence From Humans and Drosophila melanogaster Implicates the Transcription Factor MEF2B/Mef2 in Alcohol Sensitivity,31241765,10.1111/acer.14138,"Background:
      
    

    
      Self-Rating of the Effects of Alcohol (SRE) measures level of response to ethanol (EtOH) in humans. Interestingly, there is a positive relationship between the SRE and risk for abusing alcohol, suggesting mechanistic connections between SRE and alcohol abuse.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      To identify candidate genes with a role in SRE and alcohol-related behavior more generally, we coupled human genetic analyses with studies in Drosophila melanogaster. We first performed a gene-based analysis of Genomewide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics for SRE in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children sample. Based on prior findings in humans, orthology to fly genes, and the availability of genetic reagents, we selected a subset of these genes for studies on EtOH behavior in Drosophila.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We found 37 genes with nominal associations in our SRE GWAS. We explored the role of 6 orthologous genes in Drosophila EtOH sedation and rapid tolerance. We found that the transcription factor Mef2 is required for normal EtOH sedation in flies. Pan-neuronal expression of 2 independent Mef2 RNAi transgenes significantly reduced Mef2 expression and made flies resistant to EtOH sedation. Additionally, flies with multiple independent mutant alleles of Mef2 were also resistant to EtOH sedation, confirming a role for Mef2 in this behavior. Altered expression of Mef2 did not change EtOH rapid tolerance or cause a net change in internal EtOH concentrations.

Bioinformatic prediction of critical genes and pathways involved in longevity in Drosophila melanogaster,31327054,10.1007/s00438-019-01589-1,"The pursuit of longevity has been the goal of humanity since ancient times. Genetic alterations have been demonstrated to affect lifespan. As increasing numbers of pro-longevity genes and anti-longevity genes have been discovered in Drosophila, screening for functionally important genes among the large number of genes has become difficult. The aim of the present study was to explore critical genes and pathways affecting longevity in Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, 168 genes associated with longevity in D. melanogaster were collected from the Human Ageing Genomic Resources (HAGR) database. Network clustering analysis, network topological analysis, and pathway analysis were integrated to identify key genes and pathways. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was applied to verify the expression of genes in representative pathways and of predicted genes derived from the gene-gene sub-network. Our results revealed that six key pathways might be associated with longevity, including the longevity-regulating pathway, the peroxisome pathway, the mTOR-signalling pathway, the FOXO-signalling pathway, the AGE-RAGE-signalling pathway in diabetic complications, and the TGF-beta-signalling pathway. Moreover, the results revealed that six key genes in representative pathways, including Cat, Ry, S6k, Sod, Tor, and Tsc1, and the predicted genes Jra, Kay, and Rheb exhibited significant expression changes in ageing D. melanogaster strain w1118 compared to young ones.

Deleterious Effects of Neonicotinoid Pesticides on Drosophila melanogaster Immune Pathways,31575764,10.1128/mBio.01395-19,"Neonicotinoid insecticides are common agrochemicals that are used to kill pest insects and improve crop yield. However, sublethal exposure can exert unintentional toxicity to honey bees and other beneficial pollinators by dysregulating innate immunity. Generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by the dual oxidase (Duox) pathway is a critical component of the innate immune response, which functions to impede infection and maintain homeostatic regulation of the gut microbiota. Despite the importance of this pathway in gut immunity, the consequences of neonicotinoid exposure on Duox signaling have yet to be studied. Here, we use a Drosophila melanogaster model to investigate the hypothesis that imidacloprid (a common neonicotinoid) can affect the Duox pathway. The results demonstrated that exposure to sublethal imidacloprid reduced H2O2 production by inhibiting transcription of the Duox gene. Furthermore, the reduction in Duox expression was found to be a result of imidacloprid interacting with the midgut portion of the immune deficiency pathway. This impairment led to a loss of microbial regulation, as exemplified by a compositional shift and increased total abundance of Lactobacillus and Acetobacter spp. (dominant microbiota members) found in the gut. In addition, we demonstrated that certain probiotic lactobacilli could ameliorate Duox pathway impairment caused by imidacloprid, but this effect was not directly dependent on the Duox pathway itself. This study is the first to demonstrate the deleterious effects that neonicotinoids can have on Duox-mediated generation of H2O2 and highlights a novel coordination between two important innate immune pathways present in insects.IMPORTANCE Sublethal exposure to certain pesticides (e.g., neonicotinoid insecticides) is suspected to contribute to honey bee (Apis mellifera) population decline in North America. Neonicotinoids are known to interfere with immune pathways in the gut of insects, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We used a Drosophila melanogaster model to understand how imidacloprid (a common neonicotinoid) interferes with two innate immune pathways-Duox and Imd. We found that imidacloprid dysregulates these pathways to reduce hydrogen peroxide production, ultimately leading to a dysbiotic shift in the gut microbiota. Intriguingly, we found that presupplementation with probiotic bacteria could mitigate the harmful effects of imidacloprid. Thus, these observations uncover a novel mechanism of pesticide-induced immunosuppression that exploits the interconnectedness of two important insect immune pathways.",2019,"John A Chmiel, Brendan A Daisley, Jeremy P Burton, Gregor Reid, John A Chmiel, Brendan A Daisley, Jeremy P Burton, Gregor Reid"
Role of Rhodopsins as Circadian Photoreceptors in the Drosophila melanogaster,30634679,10.3390/biology8010006,"Light profoundly affects the circadian clock and the activity levels of animals.

Rapid embryonic cell cycles defer the establishment of heterochromatin by Eggless/SetDB1 in Drosophila,30808658,10.1101/gad.321646.118,"Acquisition of chromatin modifications during embryogenesis distinguishes different regions of an initially naÃ¯ve genome. In many organisms, repetitive DNA is packaged into constitutive heterochromatin that is marked by di/trimethylation of histone H3K9 and the associated protein HP1a. These modifications enforce the unique epigenetic properties of heterochromatin. However, in the early Drosophila melanogaster embryo, the heterochromatin lacks these modifications, which appear only later, when rapid embryonic cell cycles slow down at the midblastula transition (MBT). Here we focus on the initial steps restoring heterochromatic modifications in the embryo. We describe the JabbaTrap, a technique for inactivating maternally provided proteins in embryos. Using the JabbaTrap, we reveal a major requirement for the methyltransferase Eggless/SetDB1 in the establishment of heterochromatin. In contrast, other methyltransferases contribute minimally. Live imaging reveals that endogenous Eggless gradually accumulates on chromatin in interphase but then dissociates in mitosis, and its accumulation must restart in the next cell cycle. Cell cycle slowing as the embryo approaches the MBT permits increasing accumulation and action of Eggless at its targets. Experimental manipulation of interphase duration shows that cell cycle speed regulates Eggless. We propose that developmental slowing of the cell cycle times embryonic heterochromatin formation.",2019,"Charles A Seller, Chun-Yi Cho, Patrick H O'Farrell, Charles A Seller, Chun-Yi Cho, Patrick H O'Farrell"
Hydroxycitric Acid Tripotassium Inhibits Calcium Oxalate Crystal Formation in the Drosophila Melanogaster Model of Hyperoxaluria,31099342,10.12659/MSM.913637,"BACKGROUND Hydroxycitric acid is a potential lithontriptic agent for calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones in the kidneys. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficiency of hydroxycitric acid tripotassium (K-HCA) against CaOx crystal formation using Drosophila melanogaster hyperoxaluria models. MATERIAL AND METHODS Wild-type D. melanogaster were fed standard medium with ethylene glycol or sodium oxalate added to induce hyperoxaluria. Their Malpighian tubules were dissected and observed under a microscope every 3 days. Crystal deposit score of each Malpighian tubule were evaluated under a magnification of ?200. Using hyperoxaluria Drosophila models, we investigated the inhibitory efficiency of hydroxycitrate acid tripotassium and citric acid tripotassium (K-CA) against CaOx crystal formation. The survival rate of each group was also assessed. RESULTS When fed with 0.05% NaOx, the CaOx formation in Malpighian tubules increased significantly, without reduction of life span. Therefore, we selected 0.05% NaOx-induced hyperoxaluria models for the further investigations. After treatment, the stone scores showed that K-CA and K-HCA both significantly inhibit the formation of CaOx crystals in a dose-dependent manner, and with smaller dosage (0.01%), K-HCA was more efficient than K-CA. Moreover, after treatment of K-CA or K-HCA, the life span in different groups did not change, reflecting the safety to life. CONCLUSIONS The hyperoxaluria Drosophila models fed on 0.05% NaOx diet might be a useful tool to screen novel agents for the management of CaOx stones.

Therefore, carefully designed statistical measures are required in order to properly describe the characteristics of the fixation behavior and to quantify the orientation memory exhibited by the fruit flies. To this end, we propose a set of analytical methods. First, we defined the deviation angle which is used to quantify the deviation of the fruit fly's heading from the landmark positions. The deviation angle is defined based on the fruit fly's perspective and is able to reveal more task-relevant movement patterns than the commonly used definition which is based on the ""observer's perspective.""

Can Therapeutic Hypothermia Diminish the Impact of Traumatic Brain Injury in Drosophila melanogaster?,30733630,10.1177/1179069518824852,"Background/main objectives:
      
    

    
      No effective strategy exists to treat the well-recognized, devastating impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is the brain degeneration likely caused by repeated head trauma. The goals of this project were (1) to study the effects of single and recurrent TBI (rTBI) on Drosophila melanogaster's (a) life span, (b) response to sedatives, and (c) behavioral responses to light and gravity and (2) to determine whether therapeutic hypothermia can mitigate the deleterious effects of TBI.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Five experimental groups were created: (1) control, (2) single TBI or concussion; (3) concussion + hypothermia, (4) rTBI, and (5) rTBI + hypothermia. A ""high-impact trauma"" (HIT) device was built, which used a spring-based mechanism to propel flies against the wall of a vial, causing mechanical damage to the brain. Hypothermia groups were cooled to 15Â°C for 3 minutes. Group differences were analyzed with chi-square tests for the categorical variables and with ANOVA tests for the continuous variables.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Survival curve analysis showed that rTBI can decrease Drosophila lifespan and hypothermia diminished this impact. Average sedation time for control vs concussion vs concussion + hypothermia was 78 vs 52 vs 61 seconds (P < .0001). Similarly, rTBI vs rTBI/hypothermia groups took 43 vs 59 seconds (P < .0001). Concussed flies preferred dark environments compared with control flies (risk ratio 3.3, P < .01) while flies who were concussed and cooled had a risk ratio of 2.7 (P < .01). Flies with rTBI were almost 4 times likely to prefer the dark environment but only 3 times as likely if they were cooled, compared with controls. Geotaxis was significantly affected by rTBI only and yet less so if rTBI flies were cooled.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Hypothermia successfully mitigated many deleterious effects of single TBI and rTBI in Drosophila and may represent a promising breakthrough in the treatment of human TBI.",2019,"Shan Lateef, Aubrie Holman, Jessica Carpenter, Jennifer James, Shan Lateef, Aubrie Holman, Jessica Carpenter, Jennifer James"
A Multivariate Genome-Wide Association Study of Wing Shape in Drosophila melanogaster,30792267,10.1534/genetics.118.301342,"Due to the complexity of genotype-phenotype relationships, simultaneous analyses of genomic associations with multiple traits will be more powerful and informative than a series of univariate analyses. However, in most cases, studies of genotype-phenotype relationships have been analyzed only one trait at a time. Here, we report the results of a fully integrated multivariate genome-wide association analysis of the shape of the Drosophila melanogaster wing in the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel. Genotypic effects on wing shape were highly correlated between two different laboratories. We found 2396 significant SNPs using a 5% false discovery rate cutoff in the multivariate analyses, but just four significant SNPs in univariate analyses of scores on the first 20 principal component axes. One quarter of these initially significant SNPs retain their effects in regularized models that take into account population structure and linkage disequilibrium. A key advantage of multivariate analysis is that the direction of the estimated phenotypic effect is much more informative than a univariate one. We exploit this fact to show that the effects of knockdowns of genes implicated in the initial screen were on average more similar than expected under a null model. A subset of SNP effects were replicable in an unrelated panel of inbred lines. Association studies that take a phenomic approach, considering many traits simultaneously, are an important complement to the power of genomics.",2019,"William Pitchers, Jessica Nye, Eladio J MÃ¡rquez, Alycia Kowalski, Ian Dworkin, David Houle, William Pitchers, Jessica Nye, Eladio J MÃ¡rquez, Alycia Kowalski, Ian Dworkin, David Houle"
A genome-wide enhancer/suppressor screen for Dube3a interacting genes in Drosophila melanogaster,30787400,10.1038/s41598-019-38663-y,"The genetics underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are complex. Approximately 3-5% of ASD cases arise from maternally inherited duplications of 15q11.2-q13.1, termed Duplication 15q syndrome (Dup15q). 15q11.2-q13.1 includes the gene UBE3A which is believed to underlie ASD observed in Dup15q syndrome. UBE3A is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets proteins for degradation and trafficking, so finding UBE3A substrates and interacting partners is critical to understanding Dup15q ASD. In this study, we take an unbiased genetics approach to identify genes that genetically interact with Dube3a, the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of UBE3A. We conducted an enhancer/suppressor screen using a rough eye phenotype produced by Dube3a overexpression with GMR-GAL4. Using the DrosDel deficiency kit, we identified 3 out of 346 deficiency lines that enhanced rough eyes when crossed to two separate Dube3a overexpression lines, and subsequently identified IA2, GABA-B-R3, and lola as single genes responsible for rough eye enhancement. Using the FlyLight GAL4 lines to express uas-Dube3a + uas-GFP in the endogenous lola pattern, we observed an increase in the GFP signal compared to uas-GFP alone, suggesting a transcriptional co-activation effect of Dube3a on the lola promoter region. These findings extend the role of Dube3a/UBE3A as a transcriptional co-activator, and reveal new Dube3a interacting genes.",2019,"Kevin A Hope, Addison McGinn, Lawrence T Reiter, Kevin A Hope, Addison McGinn, Lawrence T Reiter"

Rab-mediated trafficking in the secondary cells of Drosophila male accessory glands and its role in fecundity,30426623,10.1111/tra.12622,"The male seminal fluid contains factors that affect female post-mating behavior and physiology. In Drosophila, most of these factors are secreted by the two epithelial cell types that make up the male accessory gland: the main and secondary cells. Although secondary cells represent only ~4% of the cells of the accessory gland, their contribution to the male seminal fluid is essential for sustaining the female post-mating response. To better understand the function of the secondary cells, we investigated their molecular organization, particularly with respect to the intracellular membrane transport machinery. We determined that large vacuole-like structures found in the secondary cells are trafficking hubs labeled by Rab6, 7, 11 and 19. Furthermore, these organelles require Rab6 for their formation and many are essential in the process of creating the long-term postmating behavior of females. In order to better serve the intracellular membrane and protein trafficking communities, we have created a searchable, online, open-access imaging resource to display our complete findings regarding Rab localization in the accessory gland.",2019,"Elodie Prince, Benjamin Kroeger, Dragan Gligorov, Clive Wilson, Suzanne Eaton, FranÃ§ois Karch, Marko Brankatschk, Robert K Maeda, Elodie Prince, Benjamin Kroeger, Dragan Gligorov, Clive Wilson, Suzanne Eaton, FranÃ§ois Karch, Marko Brankatschk, Robert K Maeda"
Cep97 Is Required for Centriole Structural Integrity and Cilia Formation in Drosophila,32589908,10.1016/j.cub.2020.05.078,"Centrioles are highly elaborate microtubule-based structures responsible for the formation of centrosomes and cilia. Despite considerable variation across species and tissues within any given tissue, their size is essentially constant [1, 2]. While the diameter of the centriole cylinder is set by the dimensions of the inner scaffolding structure of the cartwheel [3], how centriole length is set so precisely and stably maintained over many cell divisions is not well understood. Cep97 and CP110 are conserved proteins that localize to the distal end of centrioles and have been reported to limit centriole elongation in vertebrates [4, 5]. Here, we examine Cep97 function in Drosophila melanogaster. We show that Cep97 is essential for formation of full-length centrioles in multiple tissues of the fly. We further identify the microtubule deacetylase Sirt2 as a Cep97 interactor. Deletion of Sirt2 likewise affects centriole size. Interestingly, so does deletion of the acetylase Atat1, indicating that loss of stabilizing acetyl marks impairs centriole integrity. Cep97 and CP110 were originally identified as inhibitors of cilia formation in vertebrate cultured cells [6], and loss of CP110 is a widely used marker of basal body maturation. In contrast, in Drosophila, Cep97 appears to be only transiently removed from basal bodies and loss of Cep97 strongly impairs ciliogenesis. Collectively, our results support a model whereby Cep97 functions as part of a protective cap that acts together with the microtubule acetylation machinery to maintain centriole stability, essential for proper function in cilium biogenesis.",2020,"Jeroen Dobbelaere, Marketa Schmidt Cernohorska, Martina Huranova, Dea Slade, Alexander Dammermann, Jeroen Dobbelaere, Marketa Schmidt Cernohorska, Martina Huranova, Dea Slade, Alexander Dammermann"
Pits and CtBP Control Tissue Growth in Drosophila melanogaster with the Hippo Pathway Transcription Repressor Tgi,32122936,10.1534/genetics.120.303147,"The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling network that regulates organ size, cell fate, and tumorigenesis. In the context of organ size control, the pathway incorporates a large variety of cellular cues, such as cell polarity and adhesion, into an integrated transcriptional response. The central Hippo signaling effector is the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie, which controls gene expression in partnership with different transcription factors, most notably Scalloped. When it is not activated by Yorkie, Scalloped can act as a repressor of transcription, at least in part due to its interaction with the corepressor protein Tgi. The mechanism by which Tgi represses transcription is incompletely understood, and therefore we sought to identify proteins that potentially operate together with Tgi. Using an affinity purification and mass-spectrometry approach we identified Pits and CtBP as Tgi-interacting proteins, both of which have been linked to transcriptional repression. Both Pits and CtBP were required for Tgi to suppress the growth of the Drosophila melanogaster eye and CtBP loss suppressed the undergrowth of yorkie mutant eye tissue. Furthermore, as reported previously for Tgi, overexpression of Pits repressed transcription of Hippo pathway target genes. These findings suggest that Tgi might operate together with Pits and CtBP to repress transcription of genes that normally promote tissue growth. The human orthologs of Tgi, CtBP, and Pits (VGLL4, CTBP2, and IRF2BP2) have previously been shown to physically and functionally interact to control transcription, implying that the mechanism by which these proteins control transcriptional repression is conserved throughout evolution.",2020,"Joseph H A Vissers, Lucas G Dent, Colin M House, Shu Kondo, Kieran F Harvey, Joseph H A Vissers, Lucas G Dent, Colin M House, Shu Kondo, Kieran F Harvey"
Adverse effects of textile dyes on antioxidant enzymes and cholinesterase activities in Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon R +),32838564,10.1080/01480545.2020.1809671,"The effluents from textile dyeing industry are causing water pollution and may transform into more toxic and carcinogenic chemical species by environmental conditions. Therefore systemic toxicity of textile dyes is major health concern. Hence, this study sought to examine the toxic effect of disperse textile dyes on important systemic enzymes in the larvae of wild type Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon R+). Drosophila larvae were fed with corn-sugar-yeast diets containing two disperse dyes, Disperse blue-124 and Disperse black-9 (1, 10 and 100 mg/mL) for 2 days (48 h) and subsequent the enzymatic estimations were carried out using larval homogenate. In silico molecular docking studies were also performed to analyze the binding interaction of these dyes with acetyl choline esterase enzyme. Disperse black 9 shows more strong binding by occupying a groove and forming one hydrogen bond with Tyr465 of acetyl choline esterase enzyme while Disperse blue-124 shows surface binding without forming any hydrogen bond. Drosophila larvae fed on these dyes exhibited a dose-dependent increase in acetyl choline esterase enzymatic activity (1.8 fold increase with Disperse black-9, 100 mg/mL) while 4.4-folds Disperse blue-124, 100 mg/mL). Both Disperse Blue and Disperse Black dyes altered the activities of antioxidant enzymes Catalase (CAT, increased more than 2.5 fold), Superoxide dismutase (SOD, increased more than two folds) and showed a dose-dependent increase in Xanthine oxidase and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels (more than 3 folds). Therefore both the disperse dyes were found to dysregulate the activities of antioxidant enzymes which may be the underlying mechanism for their toxic effects.",2020,"Shaista Rahimi, Mahendra P Singh, Jeena Gupta, Shaista Rahimi, Mahendra P Singh, Jeena Gupta"
Dopamine modulates the optomotor response to unreliable visual stimuli in Drosophila melanogaster,31834948,10.1111/ejn.14648,"State-dependent modulation of sensory systems has been studied in many organisms and is possibly mediated through neuromodulators such as monoamine neurotransmitters. Among these, dopamine is involved in many aspects of animal behaviour, including movement control, attention, motivation and cognition. However, the precise neural mechanism underlying dopaminergic modulation of behaviour induced by sensory stimuli remains poorly understood. Here, we used Drosophila melanogaster to show that dopamine can modulate the optomotor response to moving visual stimuli including noise. The optomotor response is the head-turning response to moving objects, which is observed in most sight-reliant animals including mammals and insects. First, the effects of the dopamine system on the optomotor response were investigated in mutant flies deficient in dopamine receptors D1R1 or D1R2, which are involved in the modulation of sleep-arousal in flies. We examined the optomotor response in D1R1 knockout (D1R1 KO) and D1R2 knockout (D1R2 KO) flies and found that it was not affected in D1R1 KO flies; however, it was significantly reduced in D1R2 KO flies compared with the wild type. Using cell-type-specific expression of an RNA interference construct of D1R2, we identified the fan-shaped body, a part of the central complex, responsible for dopamine-mediated modulation of the optomotor response. In particular, pontine cells in the fan-shaped body seemed important in the modulation of the optomotor response, and their neural activity was required for the optomotor response. These results suggest a novel role of the central complex in the modulation of a behaviour based on the processing of sensory stimulations.",2020,"Masumi Akiba, Kentaro Sugimoto, Risa Aoki, Ryo Murakami, Tomoyuki Miyashita, Riho Hashimoto, Anna Hiranuma, Junji Yamauchi, Taro Ueno, Takako Morimoto, Masumi Akiba, Kentaro Sugimoto, Risa Aoki, Ryo Murakami, Tomoyuki Miyashita, Riho Hashimoto, Anna Hiranuma, Junji Yamauchi, Taro Ueno, Takako Morimoto"
An interplay between immune response and neurodegenerative disease progression: An assessment using Drosophila as a model,32683186,10.1016/j.jneuroim.2020.577302,"Neurodegeneration, the slow and progressive loss of neurons in the central nervous system has become a major challenge to public health worldwide particularly with elderly people. Until recently, the brain and immune system were studied exclusively, independent of each other representing two distinct systems. Recent studies ensue crosstalk between these two systems to maintain homeostasis. Though the progressive loss of specific neuronal subsets is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disease, emerging evidences indicate that immune response also plays a critical role in disease progression. Due to conservation of mechanisms that govern neural development and innate immune activation in flies and humans, and availability of powerful genetic tools, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is one of the best model organisms to investigate the immune response in neurodegenerative disease.

The largest conserved block contains the Runt domain, a DNA and protein binding domain conserved in a small family of mammalian transcription factors. The functional properties of the Runt domain from the D. melanogaster gene and the human AML1 (acute myeloid leukemia 1) gene were compared in vitro and in vivo. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays with Runt/AML1 chimeras demonstrated that the different DNA binding properties of Runt and AML1 are due to differences within their respective Runt domains. Ectopic expression experiments indicated that proteins containing the AML1 Runt domain function in Drosophila embryos and that sequences outside of this domain are important in vivo.",1995,"M E Pepling, J P Gergen, M E Pepling, J P Gergen"
Distribution of PCNA during postblastoderm cell division cycles in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo: effect of a string- mutation,7796467,10.1247/csf.20.47,"We used immunocytochemical methods and a specific antibody to identify proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in Drosophila embryos during the postblastoderm cell division cycles. The strong nuclear staining observed during interphase disappeared at prophase, staining remained nil throughout the remaining mitotic (M) phases and reappeared in nuclei at the next interphase. As the embryos with the homozygous string- mutation sustained the strong staining signal in nuclei throughout embryonic development, disappearance of the staining signal probably depends on string function and is coupled with the onset of mitosis. When cells in embryos were arrested at M phase following treatment with TN-16 or Vinblastine, the staining signal with the anti-PCNA antibody was lost. However, Western blots showed that the level of PCNA protein in M phase-arrested embryos did not decrease. Therefore, the disappearance of staining signals is apparently due to reorganization of PCNA protein in the multiprotein complex in nuclei, rendering it inaccessible to the antibody, rather than to the degradation of PCNA protein. In contrast to findings in developing embryos, cultured Drosophila Kc cells stained strongly with the anti-PCNA antibody, during both interphase and the M phase. In genetic crossing experiments of transgenic flies carrying the lacZ gene under the control of the PCNA gene regulatory region (-607 to +137 with respect to the transcription initiation site) with string- mutant files, the PCNA gene promoter seems to function in a manner independent of cell cycle progression or of functions of the string gene.",1995,"M Yamaguchi, Y Nishimoto, F Hirose, A Matsukage, M Yamaguchi, Y Nishimoto, F Hirose, A Matsukage"

The genomic organization of the region containing the Drosophila melanogaster rpL7a (Surf-3) gene differs from those of the mammalian and avian Surfeit loci,7739520,10.1128/mcb.15.5.2367,"The Surf-3 gene of the unusually tight mouse Surfeit locus gene cluster has been identified as the highly conserved ribosomal protein gene L7a (rpL7a). The topography and juxtaposition of the Surfeit locus genes are conserved for the 600 million years of divergent evolution between mammals and birds. This suggests cis interaction and/or coregulation of the genes and suggests that, within this locus, gene organization plays an important role in gene expression. The further evolutionary conservation of the organization of the Surfeit locus was investigated. A cDNA encoding the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of the Surf-3/rpL7a gene was cloned, was shown to be present as a single copy, and was expressed constitutively at high levels throughout development. Genomic cosmid clones encompassing the gene and its surrounding DNA were isolated. The gene was determined to have five introns, of which two were located in the 5' untranslated region of the gene. The remaining three introns had splice sites at positions equivalent to those found in the Surf-3/rpL7a mammalian homologs. S1 analysis and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends both confirmed the start of transcription to occur in a polypyrimidine tract in the absence of a TATA box in the promoter. The genomic region around the Surf-3/rpL7a gene was analyzed by low-stringency hybridization with murine Surfeit gene probes, by partial sequence analysis, and by hybridization of fragments to Northern (RNA) blots. No homologs of other members of the Surfeit gene cluster were detected in close proximity to the D. melanogaster Surf-3/rpL7a gene. However, a gene which was detected directly 3' to the Surf-3/rpL7a gene was shown to encode a homolog of a mammalian serine-pyruvate aminotransferase.",1995,"N Armes, M Fried, N Armes, M Fried"
Conditional hitchhiking of mitochondrial DNA: frequency shifts of Drosophila melanogaster mtDNA variants depend on nuclear genetic background,8582617,,"Tests were performed of the selective neutrality of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants from geographic populations of Drosophila melanogaster in Argentina (ARG) and Central Africa (CAF). The two populations were completely reproductively compatible. The two distinct mtDNA haplotypes from the two populations were competed in replicate experimental populations on three nuclear genetic backgrounds: homozygous ARG, homozygous CAF, or hybrid ARG/CAF. Mitochondrial haplotype frequencies did not change significantly on either of the two homozygous nuclear backgrounds, and there was no change after experimental perturbation of haplotype frequencies. On the hybrid background, the ARG haplotype frequency increased significantly for the first two generations in all replicate populations but then did not change in subsequent generations. After perturbation, the ARG haplotype frequency increased in only one of four replicates. There is no evidence for selective differences among mtDNA variants in homozygous nuclear contexts or for nuclear-mitochondrial coadaptation. While some ""fitness"" difference among mtDNA variants is required to account for the observed frequency shifts, it appears that in these hybrid populations, mtDNA is hitchhiking on fitness variation among hybrid segregating nuclear genes. These results have implications for the use of mtDNA in the study of hybrid zones and gene flow.",1995,"S T Kilpatrick, D M Rand, S T Kilpatrick, D M Rand"

"Flamenco, a gene controlling the gypsy retrovirus of Drosophila melanogaster",7713426,,"Gypsy is an endogenous retrovirus of Drosophila melanogaster. It is stable and does not transpose with detectable frequencies in most Drosophila strains. However, we have characterized unstable strains, known as MG, in which it transposes at high frequency. These stocks contain more copies of gypsy than usual stocks. Transposition results in mutations in several genes such as ovo and cut. They are stable and are due to gypsy insertions. Integrations into the ovoD1 female sterile-dominant mutation result in a null allele of the gene and occurrence of fertile females. This phenomenon, known as the ovoD1 reversion assay, can be used to quantitate gypsy activity. We have shown that the properties of MG strains result from mutation of a host gene that we called flamenco (flam). It has a strict maternal effect on gypsy mobilization: transposition occurs at high frequency only in the germ line of the progeny of females homozygous for mutations of the gene. It is located at position 65.9 (20A1-3) on the X chromosome. The mutant allele present in MG strains is essentially recessive.

When a hsp82 heat shock promoter-Mos1 construct was used to supply mariner transposase, excision products were also recovered from the Queensland fruitfly Bactrocera tryoni. Analysis of DNA sequences at empty excision sites led us to hypothesise that the mariner excision/repair process involves the formation of a heteroduplex at the excision breakpoint.

We report here the genetic characterization and cloning of Mothers against dpp (Mad), a gene identified in two such screens. Mad loss-of-function mutations interact with dpp alleles to enhance embryonic dorsal-ventral patterning defects, as well as adult appendage defects, suggesting a role for Mad in mediating some aspect of dpp function. In support of this, homozygous Mad mutant animals exhibit defects in midgut morphogenesis, imaginal disk development and embryonic dorsal-ventral patterning that are very reminiscent of dpp mutant phenotypes. We cloned the Mad region and identified the Mad transcription unit through germline transformation rescue. We sequenced a Mad cDNA and identified three Mad point mutations that alter the coding information.

"The ovarian tumor protein isoforms of Drosophila melanogaster exhibit differences in function, expression, and localization",7851643,10.1006/dbio.1995.1017,"The Drosophila melanogaster ovarian tumor (otu) gene, required for normal proliferation and differentiation of the female germ-line, encodes two cytoplasmic protein isoforms, 98 and 104 kDa.

Analysis of transformants expressing only one of the otu isoforms showed that the 104-kDa isoform (otu-104) can rescue all classes of otu mutants, whereas only differentiated mutants are rescued to a significant extent by the 98-kDa isoform (otu-98). Western analysis of protein extracts prepared from ovaries of various developmental stages indicated that otu-104 predominates in predifferentiated stages, while otu-98 is prevalent in differentiated egg chambers. Immunolocalization experiments demonstrated that otu protein is present in the cytoplasm of oogonial stem cells that populate third instar larvae and in all germ-line-derived cells until late in oogenesis. In stage 10 egg chambers, otu protein shifts to the subcortical region of nurse cells. This type of analysis also showed that upon formation of a 16-cell syncytium otu-104, but not otu-98, preferentially accumulates in the developing oocyte cytoplasm. The otu mutant protein does not show this pattern of enhanced accumulation, nor does it occur in ovaries of egalitarian and Bicaudal-D mutants, which are defective in oocyte determination. Thus, these studies indicate that the 104-kDa isoform is required for normal proliferation of female germline cells and perhaps for oocyte differentiation. The 98-kDa isoform appears to be dispensable but can provide an otu function needed for the completion of oocyte maturation.",1995,"G L Sass, A R Comer, L L Searles, G L Sass, A R Comer, L L Searles"
Analysis of copia sequence variation within and between Drosophila species,7877499,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040193,"The sequences of the 5' long-terminal repeat (LTR) and adjacent leader regions of 27 full-length copia elements isolated from natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. mauritiana are presented.

LTRs and adjacent 5' leader regions of elements isolated from D. simulans and D. mauritiana are structurally similar to one another and carry substantial deletional variation mapping to regions previously identified as being of potential importance for copia expression.",1995,"A K Csink, J F McDonald, A K Csink, J F McDonald"
Serrate expression can functionally replace Delta activity during neuroblast segregation in the Drosophila embryo,7720588,,Serrate and Delta encode structurally related proteins in D. melanogaster that bind within a common extracellular region on the NOTCH receptor molecule. We used ectopic expression to determine if SERRATE could mediate in vivo functions parallel or antagonistic to those proposed for the putative NOTCH ligand DELTA. Our results demonstrate that Serrate can replace Delta gene function during embryonic neuroblast segregation and that expression of Serrate leads to a NOTCH-dependent suppression of achaete expression in proneural clusters. Our findings strongly suggest that SERRATE functions as an alternative ligand capable of NOTCH activation.,1995,"Y Gu, N A Hukriede, R J Fleming, Y Gu, N A Hukriede, R J Fleming"
Regulation of choline acetyltransferase/lacZ fusion gene expression in putative cholinergic neurons of Drosophila melanogaster,8586966,10.1002/neu.480280107,"We have analyzed the distribution of putative cholinergic neurons in whole-mount preparations of adult Drosophila melanogaster. Putative cholinergic neurons were visualized by X-gal staining of P-element transformed flies carrying a fusion gene consisting of 5' flanking DNA from the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) gene and lacZ reporter gene. We have previously demonstrated that cryostat sections of transgenic flies carrying 7.4 kb of ChAT 5' flanking DNA show reporter gene expression in a pattern essentially similar to the known distribution of ChAT protein. Whole-mount staining of these same flies by X-gal should thus represent the overall distribution of ChAT-positive neurons. Extensive staining was observed in the cephalic, thoracic, and stomodeal ganglia, primary sensory neurons in antenna, maxillary palps, labial palps, leg, wing, and male genitalia. Primary sensory neurons associated with photoreceptors and tactile receptors were not stained. We also examined the effects of partial deletions of the 7.4 kb fragment on reporter gene expression. Deletion of the 7.4 kb fragment to 1.2 kb resulted in a dramatic reduction of X-gal staining in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). This indicates that important regulatory elements for ChAT expression in the PNS exist in the distal region of the 7.4 kb fragment. The distal parts of the 7.4 kb fragment, when fused to a basal heterologous promoter, can independently confer gene expression in subsets of putative cholinergic neurons. With these constructs, however, strong ectopic expression was also observed in several non-neuronal tissues.",1995,"T Kitamoto, K Ikeda, P M Salvaterra, T Kitamoto, K Ikeda, P M Salvaterra"

Molecular phylogeny and divergence times of drosophilid species,7739381,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040214,"The phylogenetic relationships and divergence times of 39 drosophilid species were studied by using the coding region of the Adh gene. Four genera--Scaptodrosophila, Zaprionus, Drosophila, and Scaptomyza (from Hawaii)--and three Drosophila subgenera--Drosophila, Engiscaptomyza, and Sophophora--were included. After conducting statistical analyses of the nucleotide sequences of the Adh, Adhr (Adh-related gene), and nuclear rRNA genes and a 905-bp segment of mitochondrial DNA, we used Scaptodrosophila as the outgroup. The phylogenetic tree obtained showed that the first major division of drosophilid species occurs between subgenus Sophophora (genus Drosophila) and the group including subgenera Drosophila and Engiscaptomyza plus the genera Zaprionus and Scaptomyza. Subgenus Sophophora is then divided into D. willistoni and the clade of D. obscura and D. melanogaster species groups. In the other major drosophilid group, Zaprionus first separates from the other species, and then D. immigrans leaves the remaining group of species. This remaining group then splits into the D. repleta group and the Hawaiian drosophilid cluster (Hawaiian Drosophila, Engiscaptomyza, and Scaptomyza). Engiscaptomyza and Scaptomyza are tightly clustered. Each of the D. repleta, D. obscura, and D. melanogaster groups is monophyletic. The splitting of subgenera Drosophila and Sophophora apparently occurred about 40 Mya, whereas the D. repleta group and the Hawaiian drosophilid cluster separated about 32 Mya. By contrast, the splitting of Engiscaptomyza and Scaptomyza occurred only about 11 Mya, suggesting that Scaptomyza experienced a rapid morphological evolution. The D. obscura and D. melanogaster groups apparently diverged about 25 Mya. Many of the D. repleta group species studied here have two functional Adh genes (Adh-1 and Adh-2), and these duplicated genes can be explained by two duplication events.",1995,"C A Russo, N Takezaki, M Nei, C A Russo, N Takezaki, M Nei"
"Analysis of a vitellogenin gene of the mosquito, Aedes aegypti and comparisons to vitellogenins from other organisms",7550249,10.1016/0965-1748(95)00037-v,"A genomic clone of the Aedes aegypti vitellogenin A1 gene was sequenced including 2015 bp of 5' untranscribed sequence, 6369 bp of open reading frame interrupted by two introns, and a short 3' untranslated region. Primer extension was used to identify the transcription initiation site. The amino termini of the large and small subunits were located by N-terminal sequencing of vitellin purified from eggs. The length of the signal sequence and the position of the cleavage site between the two subunits were also determined. Three sequential imperfect repeats were found near the beginning of the small subunit. The sequence of the coding region appears to be polymorphic. Comparison of the signal sequences of seven insect vitellogenin genes revealed several conserved leucines, and a conserved position of an intron. However, the signal sequences are not conserved between these genes and the yolk protein genes of Cyclorraphid Dipteran insects. The cleavage sites between the small and large subunits in the vitellogenins of the mosquito, A. aegypti, sawfly, Athalia rosae, boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis, and silkworm, Bombyx mori are flanked by sequences rich in serine. Pairwise dot matrix analysis at the protein level showed that the mosquito, boll weevil and silkworm vitellogenins are significantly related with approx. 50% similarity. One region of the three insect vitellogenin genes, near the N-terminal of the large subunit, showed the highest levels of similarity, from 57.5 to 64.4%. The position of cysteines in insect vitellogenins is conserved, particularly in the C-terminus of the large subunit. Dot matrix comparison of the mosquito vitellogenin with that of Xenopus laevis and Caenorhabditis elegans showed much lower, but still significant degrees of relationship. Pairwise comparisons of the mosquito vitellogenin and the Drosophila melanogaster yolk proteins did not show significant similarities. Potential regulatory regions in the mosquito VgA1 gene were identified by comparison to regulatory elements known from other organisms, especially D. melanogaster, which could provide useful information for further functional analysis.",1995,"P Romans, Z Tu, Z Ke, H H Hagedorn, P Romans, Z Tu, Z Ke, H H Hagedorn"
Transposable elements map in a conserved pattern of distribution extending from beta-heterochromatin to centromeres in Drosophila melanogaster,7664614,10.1007/BF00344228,"In situ hybridisation to mitotic chromosomes shows that sequences homologous to different Drosophila melanogaster transposable elements are widely distributed not only in beta but also in alpha-heterochromatin.

They colocalise with known satellite sequences in several regions, but are also located in places where no known sequence has been mapped so far. The pattern of hybridisation is dinstinctive and specific for each element, and presents constant features in six different D. melanogaster strains studied.

Sh mutants were more sensitive in the knock-down response after gamma-ray irradiation than wild types. There were a great amount of sex difference in the knock-down response, males being more sensitive than females, but not in the killing response. The sex difference was larger than gene dosage effect on X chromosome in females. Genetical analysis revealed that the sensitivity of the knock-down response is an incompletely dominant character without maternal effects. The leg-shaking response, which had previously been reported to be induced by ether treatment, was demonstrated in the head-removed flies of Sh mutants. It was found to be the most sensitive among the responses tested, and may involve changes in K+ channel. The knock-down response may be related to expansion of the leg-shaking response. The killing response should have causes different from the leg-shaking and the knock-down responses judging from the lack of correlation with them.",1995,"T Megumi, S Gamo, T Ohonishi, Y Tanaka, T Megumi, S Gamo, T Ohonishi, Y Tanaka"
"The human archain gene, ARCN1, has highly conserved homologs in rice and Drosophila",7782067,10.1016/0888-7543(95)80087-3,"A novel human gene, ARCN1, has been identified in chromosome band 11q23.3. It maps approximately 50 kb telomeric to MLL, a gene that is disrupted in a number of leukemia-associated translocation chromosomes. cDNA clones representing ARCN1 hybridize to 4-kb mRNA species present in all tissues tested. Sequencing of cDNAs suggests that at least two forms of mRNA with alternative 5' ends are present within the cell. The mRNA with the longest open reading frame gives rise to a protein of 57 kDa. Although the sequence reported is novel, remarkable similarity is observed with two predicted protein sequences from partial DNA sequences generated by rice (Oryza sativa) and fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) genome projects. The degree of sequence conservation is comparable to that observed for highly conserved structural proteins, such as heat shock protein HSP70, and is greater than that of gamma-tubulin and heat shock protein HSP60. A more distant relationship to the group of clathrin-associated proteins suggests a possible role in vesicle structure or trafficking.

Molecular characterization of the breakpoints of an inversion fixed between Drosophila melanogaster and D. subobscura,7705632,,"The two breakpoints of a chromosomal inversion fixed since the split of Drosophila melanogaster and D. subobscura lineages have been isolated and sequenced in both species.

Close to one of these breakpoints a new transcription unit (bcn92) has been identified in both species. The inversion fixed between D. melanogaster and D. subobscura does not seem to have broken any transcription unit. Neither complete nor defective transposable elements were found in the regions encompassing the breakpoints.

Retrotransposon insertion induces an isozyme of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in Drosophila melanogaster,8618845,10.1073/pnas.92.26.12065,"The insertion of the blood retrotransposon into the untranslated region of exon 7 of the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-encoding gene (Gpdh) in Drosophila melanogaster induces a GPDH isozyme-GPDH-4-and alters the pattern of expression of the three normal isozymes-GPDH-1 to GPDH-3. The process of transcript terminus formation inside the retrotransposon insertion reduces the level of the Gpdh transcript that contains exon 8 and increases the level of the transcript that contains exons 1-7. The induced GPDH-4 isozyme is a translation product of the three transcripts that contain fragments of the blood retrotransposon. The mechanism of mutagenesis by the blood insertion is postulated to involve the pause or termination of transcription within the blood sequence, which in turn is caused by the interference of a DNA-binding protein with the RNA polymerase. Thus, we show the formation of a new functional GPDH protein by the insertion of a transposable element and discuss the evolutionary significance of this phenomenon.",1995,"T M Wilanowski, J B Gibson, J E Symonds, T M Wilanowski, J B Gibson, J E Symonds"

Sequential gene activation by ecdysone in Drosophila melanogaster: the hierarchical equivalence of early and early late genes,7743931,,"Ecdysteroids are key regulators of insect development. In Drosophila melanogaster the late larval response to ecdysone is characterised by a precise sequential activation of members of the superfamily of nuclear receptors (DHR3, DHR39, EcR, E75, E78, FTZ-F1, usp). Many of these genes are localised in the polytene chromosome puffs of the salivary gland previously classified as intermoult, early or early-late puff loci. Ashburner et al. (Ashburner, M., Chihara, C., Meltzer, P. and Richards, G. (1974) Cold Spring Harbour Symp. Quant. Biol. 38, 655-662) proposed a formal model describing interactions between ecdysone, its receptor and the early and late puffs during this ecdysone response. To integrate transcripts from the intermoult and early-late puffs into this model, we have used a micro RT-PCR assay to study their hormonal regulation using salivary gland culture protocols first used in the puffing analyses. We show that transcripts from certain early-late puffs are induced in parallel with the early transcripts and are thus hierarchically equivalent. In vivo the profile of the increase in hormone titre, the sensitivity of different promoters to hormone and the rate of transcript accumulation must contribute to the temporal differences in expression observed between these two classes.",1995,"F Huet, C Ruiz, G Richards, F Huet, C Ruiz, G Richards"

Gas-chromatographic analysis of sexual mosaics reveals that the sex specificity of hydrocarbons is located in the abdomen. This explains previous observations that D. melanogaster males display the strongest courtship toward mosaics with female abdomens. We also show that males of the sibling species Drosophila simulans preferentially court D. melanogaster mosaics with male abdomens. Because the primary male hydrocarbon in D. melanogaster is also the primary female hydrocarbon in D. simulans, this supports the idea that interspecific differences in cuticular hydrocarbons contribute to sexual isolation.",1995,"J A Coyne, R Oyama"
Differences in DNA sequence recognition by the heat-shock factors of Drosophila melanogaster and the parasitic helminth Schistosoma mansoni,7578247,10.1016/0167-4781(95)00151-6,"It was recently shown that schistosome extracts contain heat-shock factor (HSF) activity that correlates with the pattern of hsp70 mRNA levels at different developmental stages of the parasite (Levy-Holtzman and Schechter (1994) Parasitology 108, 35-42). To extend our understanding of the HSF activity revealed in extracts of Schistosoma mansoni (Sm), it was further analyzed by competition experiments and compared with the well characterized HSF of Drosophila melanogaster (Dm). The interactions of HSF in Sm extracts (SmHSF) and HSF of Dm (DmHSF) with 32P-labeled heat shock element (HSE) probes, with and without unlabeled competitor DNA probes (HSE-related oligos), were analyzed by gel retardation assay. The binding and inhibition studies demonstrated that SmHSF and DmHSF differ in HSE sequence recognition: an array of three nGAAn inverted repeats according to the ideal consensus sequence (nGAAnnTTCnnGAAn) is recognized by DmHSF, but not by SmHSF. In the schistosome, binding is attained only when the third pentamer is a variant, composed of nGTAn instead of nGAAn. The presence of this variant in the promoter of the hsp70 gene of the parasite suggests coevolution of the variant sequence together with the SmHSF which interacts efficiently with the variant, but not with the ideal HSE sequence. Further inhibition studies revealed additional differences between SmHSF and DmHSF in recognition of the first and second nGAAn pentamers of HSE. In analogy to other systems of ligand-protein interactions, we propose that the complementarity between the HSE ligand and the HSF protein is higher in SmHSF, as compared to DmHSF.",1995,"R Levy-Holtzman, J Clos, I Schechter, R Levy-Holtzman, J Clos, I Schechter"

In agreement with previously reported studies on native insect GABA receptors and native expressed vertebrate GABA receptors, acetylation of the bridgehead hydroxyl group (picrotoxinin acetate) greatly reduced the activity of the molecule, but surprisingly, substitution with flourine at the same position also reduced the activity. Conversion of the terminal isopropenyl group to an acetyl (alpha-picrotoxinone) or hydration of the double bond (picrotin) also reduced activity, in agreement with findings for native insect and mammalian receptors. The present results suggest that interactions of convulsants with homo-oligomeric and multimeric GABA receptors are qualitatively similar.

Several regions were shown independently of each other to confer nutritional regulation on the expression of the yp1 and yp2 genes. This regulation can be induced both on the yp promoter and the heterologous Drosophila heat-shock 70 (hsp 70) promoter. The redundancy of sequences conferring a nutritional response on the yp genes is similar to that observed for the female specificity of these genes and suggest that several DNA binding proteins interact to provide the correct regulation of these genes. These results suggest that nutrition acts to modify the level of a trans-acting factor in the fat body.

Meiosis in Drosophila males. I. The question of separate conjunctive mechanisms for the XY and autosomal bivalents,7821091,10.1007/BF00417883,"The conjunctive mechanism of the XY bivalent is believed to differ from that of the autosomal bivalents in the achiasmate Drosophila melanogaster male. It has been proposed that hypothetical cohesive elements, termed collochores, hold the X and Y chromosomes together at or near their nucleolar organizing regions (NORs) and that collochores are not exhibited by autosomal bivalents. In electron micrographs, unique fibrillar material is observed between the X and Y chromosomes at the synaptic site. Recently, the 240 bp nontranscribed spacer associated with rRNA genes at the NOR has been implicated as the essential DNA sequence for XY pairing. To test whether this DNA sequence is always associated with XY pairing and to determine its relationship to the unique fibrillar material, we studied the XY bivalent in Drosophila simulans. The D. simulans Y chromosome has few, if any, rRNA genes, but does have a large block (3,000 kb or 12,500 copies) of the nontranscribed spacer repeat located at the distal end of its long arm. This is in contrast to the D. melanogaster Y, which has the repeat located among rRNA genes on its short arm. Using light and electron microscopy, we show that the X does indeed pair with the distal end of the long arm of the D. simulans Y. However, no fibrillar material is evident in serial thin sections of the D. simulans XY bivalent, suggesting that this material (in D. melanogaster) may be remnants of the NOR rather than a morphological manifestation of the hypothetical collochores.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1994,"J G Ault, C L Rieder, J G Ault, C L Rieder"

Dynamic equilibrium between insertion and excision of P elements in highly inbred lines from an M' strain of Drosophila melanogaster,7807536,10.1007/BF00173415,"Six highly inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster extracted from an M' strain (in the P/M system of hybrid dysgenesis) were studied for the evolution of the number and chromosomal location of complete and defective P elements through generations 52-200. These lines possessed full-sized P elements but differed in their cytotype (M or P). Three lines with P cytotype and full-sized P elements at site 1A had a constant P copy number over generations with low rates of insertion and excision. Three lines with M cytotype and at least one full-sized P element accumulated P copies over the generations and reached a plateau near generation 196, at which rates of transposition and excision were equal to 1.2 x 10(-3) to 3 x 10(-3) events per element per generation. At that time these three lines still presented an M cytotype, produced transposase, and were able to regulate P copy number. The similarity at equilibrium between insertion and excision rates was exactly what was expected from theoretical models for a self-regulated element. The large number of generations necessary to attain the equilibrium in copy number indicates, however, that caution may be de rigueur when testing theoretical models of copy-number containment based on transposition and excision-rate comparison.",1994,"C BiÃ©mont, C BiÃ©mont"
Characterization of the KLP68D kinesin-like protein in Drosophila: possible roles in axonal transport,7525600,10.1083/jcb.127.4.1041,"This paper describes the molecular and biochemical properties of KLP68D, a new kinesin-like motor protein in Drosophila melanogaster. Sequence analysis of a full-length cDNA encoding KLP68D demonstrates that this protein has a domain that shares significant sequence identity with the entire 340-amin acid kinesin heavy chain motor domain. Sequences extending beyond the motor domain predict a region of alpha-helical coiled-coil followed by a globular ""tail"" region; there is significant sequence similarity between the alpha-helical coiled-coil region of the KLP68D protein and similar regions of the KIF3 protein of mouse and the KRP85 protein of sea urchin. This finding suggests that all three proteins may be members of the same family, and that they all perform related functions. KLP68D protein produced in Escherichia coli is, like kinesin itself, a plus-end directed microtubule motor. In situ hybridization analysis of KLP68D RNA in Drosophila embryos indicates that the KLP68D gene is expressed primarily in the central nervous system and in a subset of the peripheral nervous system during embryogenesis. Thus, KLP68D may be used for anterograde axonal transport and could conceivably move cargoes in fly neurons different than those moved by kinesin heavy chain or other plus-end directed motors.",1994,"P A Pesavento, R J Stewart, L S Goldstein, P A Pesavento, R J Stewart, L S Goldstein"
Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis coupled with stratified DNA sequencing reveals reduced sequence variation in the su(s) and su(wa) regions of the Drosophila melanogaster X chromosome,8197115,10.1073/pnas.91.11.4658,"Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis followed by DNA sequencing of stratified sub-samples was used to survey DNA polymorphism in the su(s) and su(wa) regions in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster. su(s) and su(wa) are located near the telomere of the X chromosome, where the rate of crossing over per kilobase of DNA monotonically decreases toward the tip. SSCP was assessed in 12 noncoding segments amplified from the su(s) region (3213 bp) and in 8 noncoding segments amplified from the su(wa) region (1955 bp). Sets of segments were multiplexed in a single electrophoretic lane to increase the number of base pairs assayed per lane. Eight segments were monomorphic, and the other 12 segments exhibited two to four SSCP classes. Only four within-SSCP-class DNA sequence differences (a single nucleotide substitution) were observed among 24,360 bp compared within classes. The between-SSCP-class DNA sequence comparisons revealed 27 substitutions and 9 insertion/deletion polymorphisms. The average numbers of substitutional differences per site were 0.0010 and 0.0021 for su(s) and su(wa), respectively. These values are intermediate between those reported for the more distal y-ASC region (0.0004) and the more proximal Pgd locus (0.0024). This observation is consistent with the prediction of the hitchhiking-effect model-i.e., a monotonic increase in polymorphism as a function of crossing over per kilobase.",1994,"M AguadÃ©, W Meyers, A D Long, C H Langley, M AguadÃ©, W Meyers, A D Long, C H Langley"
Mapping RNA regions in eukaryotic ribosomes that are accessible to methidiumpropyl-EDTA.Fe(II) and EDTA.Fe(II),8060991,10.1021/bi00199a004,Methidiumpropyl-EDTA.Fe(II) [MPE.Fe(II)] and EDTA.Fe(II) were used to investigate the structure of Drosophila melanogaster ribosomes. Cleavage reactions were performed on intact ribosomes in cell lysates in vitro and analyzed by primer extension with reverse transcriptase using oligodeoxynucleotide primers. Regions of 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) which are accessible to MPE.Fe(II) and EDTA.Fe(II) are located almost exclusively within expansion segments. The accessibility of these regions to cleavage indicates that they are likely exposed on the surface of eukaryotic ribosomes. These results provide information about the overall tertiary structure of rRNA in ribosomes.,1994,"H Han, A Schepartz, M Pellegrini, P B Dervan, H Han, A Schepartz, M Pellegrini, P B Dervan"
Inversion polymorphism and extra bristles in Indian natural populations of Drosophila ananassae: joint variation,7989220,10.1038/hdy.1994.188,"Five Indian natural populations of Drosophila ananassae were analysed for chromosome inversions and the presence of individuals with extra scutellar bristles in the F1 progeny of isofemale lines initiated from naturally impregnated females. Three commonly occurring inversions were found in these populations with varying frequencies as was the number of individuals with extra bristles (e.b.). Female individuals were more often found to carry extra scutellar bristles than were males. This result reveals that polygenic loci responsible for the determination of e.b. are widespread in Indian natural populations of D. ananassae. A significant positive correlation between the inversion frequency and the number of individuals with e.b. was detected in the isofemale lines of all the five populations. The 2L inversion, alpha, was found to be closely associated with individuals with the e.b. phenotype. The observed results are compared with earlier results obtained for D. melanogaster. The association of the alpha inversion with the e.b. phenotype is discussed in relation to chromosomal evolution in the melanogaster species group.",1994,"A Das, S Mohanty, B B Parida, A Das, S Mohanty, B B Parida"

Modifications were also proposed: (1) The Rare cosmopolitans were limited to the 3 inversions, In(3L)M, In(3R)C and In(3R)Mo, instead of 8 inversions originally included. (2) Ambiguity between Endemic and Unique was noted and discussed. Data were presented to show that repeated surveys of the usual scale in a natural population indeed detected Endemic inversions which otherwise would have been classified as Unique inversions.

Sepiapterin reductase and the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin in Drosophila melanogaster,7951268,10.1016/0965-1748(94)90019-1,"Ammonium sulfate fractionation and standard column chromatography techniques have been used to purify the enzyme sepiapterin reductase to electrophoretic homogeneity from pupae of Drosophila melanogaster. This purification constitutes a 1000-fold increase in the specific activity of the enzyme. The native molecular weight of the enzyme was determined to be ca 67,000 Da, while the subunit molecular weight is estimated to be 36,000-39,000 Da. The apparent Km for 6-lactoyltetrahydropterin (lactoyl-H4pterin) is 50 microns. The Drosophila enzyme is sensitive to inhibition by the biogenic amine, N-acetyl serotonin, and (to a lesser extent) melatonin, but its activity is not affected by serotonin, epinephrine or norepinephrine. The enzyme was shown to be an integral component of the Drosophila enzyme system which functions in catalyzing the conversion of dihydroneopterin triphosphate (H2NTP) to (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4biopterin). It appears that although purified Drosophila sepiapterin reductase can catalyze low levels of conversion of 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin (pyruvoyl-H4pterin) to H4 biopterin in the presence of NADPH, the efficient conversion of pyruvoyl-H4pterin to H4biopterin requires the presence of both sepiapterin reductase and pyruvoyl-H4pterin reductase.",1994,"J P Primus, G M Brown, J P Primus, G M Brown"
Interspecific transgenic analysis of basal versus heat-shock-induced expression of a Drosophila pseudoobscura hsp82-neo fusion gene in D. melanogaster,28305933,10.1007/BF00361104,"Drosophila melanogaster transformants containing a D. pseudoobscura hsp82-neo fusion gene were used to examine the relationship between chromosome structure and its variation to transcriptional activation and gene expression. At normal temperatures (25Â° C) transgenic hsp82-neo was transcribed in diffuse polytene chromosomal bands encoding antibiotic G418-resistance without intensive puff formation. Substantial basal expression of the transgene was observed in all tissues examined: salivary glands, brain, ventral ganglion, foregut, gastric caeca, midgut, imaginal discs, nurse cells and oocytes. In addition, basal hsp82-neo expression occurred throughout embryogenesis. In third-instar larvae subjected to optimal heat shock (36Â° C), novel heat-shock puffs at the transgene insertion sites in polytene salivary gland chromosomes resulted from a five-fold higher hsp82-neo transcription. Even at extreme heat shock (38Â° C) the transgene puffs corresponded to transcriptionally active sites. RNA probe protections showed that the natural intron of the D. pseudoobscura hsp82-neo transgene was efficiently removed from pre-mRNA by the D. melanogaster splicing machinery at 25-36Â° C. Upon extreme heat shock above 37Â° C intron splicing was inhibited. During recovery (25Â° C) from heat shock (36Â° C/20 min) the heat-induced hsp82-neo transcription was rapidly repressed and all novel transgene puffs regressed. The basal level of transcription of hsp82-neo pre-mRNA was restored within 1-2 h. The hsp82-neo mRNA returned to basal level within 3-4 h. Overall, these results demonstrate a conservation of cis-regulatory elements and trans-regulatory factors which is needed for faithful expression across the species barrier of the D. pseudoobscura hsp82-neo transgene in D. melanogaster.",1994,"Heinz Sass, Heinz Sass"
Nucleotide sequence of the genomic region encompassing Adh and Adh-dup genes of D. lebanonensis (Scaptodrosophila): gene expression and evolutionary relationships,8028024,10.1007/BF00178845,"The region of the genome of D. lebanonensis that contains the Adh gene and the downstream Adh-dup gene was sequenced. The structure of the two genes is the same as has been described for D. melanogaster. Adh has two promoters and Adh-dup has only one putative promoter. The levels of expression of the two genes in this species are dramatically different. Hybridizing the same Northern blots with a specific probe for Adh-dup, we did not find transcripts for this gene in D. lebanonensis. The level of Adh distal transcript in adults of D. lebanonensis is five times greater than that of D. melanogaster adults. The maximum levels of proximal transcript are attained at different larval stages in the two species, being three times higher in D. melanogaster late-second-instar larvae than in D. lebanonensis first-instar larvae. The level of Adh transcripts allowed us to determine distal and proximal initiation transcription sites, the position of the first intron, the use of two polyadenylation signals, and the heterogeneity of polyadenylation sites. Temporal and spatial expression profiles of the Adh gene of D. lebanonensis show qualitative differences compared with D. melanogaster. Adh and Adh-dup evolve differently as shown by the synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates for the coding region of both genes when compared across two species of the melanogaster group, two of the obscura group of the subgenus Sophophora and D. lebanonensis of the victoria group of the subgenus Scaptodrsophila. Synonymous rates for Adh are approximately half those for Adh-dup, while nonsynonymous rates for Adh are generally higher than those for Adh-dup. Adh shows 76.8% identities at the protein level and 70.2% identities at the nucleotide level while Adh-dup shows 83.7% identities at the protein level and 67.5% identities at the nucleotide level. Codon usage for Adh-dup is shown to be less biased than for Adh, which could explain the higher synonymous rates and the generally lower nonsynonymous substitution rates in Adh-dup compared with Adh. Phylogenetic trees reconstructed by distance matrix and parsimony methods show that Sophophora and Scaptodrosophila subgenera diverged shortly after the separation from the Drosophila subgenus.",1994,"E Juan, M Papaceit, A Quintana, E Juan, M Papaceit, A Quintana"

The peaks mean values usually corresponded to ALS of the parents. A major peak of mortality was detected in hybrid males, and its mean was higher than ALS values characteristic of both parents.

Localized expression of a novel micropia-like element in the blastoderm of Drosophila melanogaster is dependent on the anterior morphogen bicoid,8055714,10.1007/BF00352316,"We have identified a novel transposon-like element of Drosophila melanogaster that is present in approximately 20 copies in the genome. It codes for a polyprotein containing the diagnostic sequence motifs for a nucleic acid binding CCHC protein, a proteinase, a reverse transcriptase and an integrase as typically found in retroviruses. Owing to its early expression in the blastoderm embryo, and its close relationship to micropia, a previously identified Drosophila retrotransposon, we termed the novel element ""blastopia"". The spatially restricted expression of blastopia transcripts in head anlagen of the blastoderm embryo is under the direct or indirect control of the Drosophila morphogen bicoid, which is normally required to establish the anterior pattern elements in the embryo. Our results suggest that a blastopia element acts as an ""enhancer trap"", and thereby participates in the control of an as yet unidentified gene normally expressed in the head anlagen of the embryo.",1994,"G Frommer, R Schuh, H JÃ¤ckle, G Frommer, R Schuh, H JÃ¤ckle"

Interspecific comparison of Drosophila serendipity delta and beta: multimodular structure of these C2H2 zinc finger proteins,8006993,10.1007/BF00176088,"The Drosophila serendipity (sry) beta and delta genes, which resulted from a gene duplication event, provide an interesting model for the evolutionary diversification in structure and function of C2H2 zinc finger proteins. We examined here the divergence of the sry beta and delta proteins over an estimated period of 45 million years by comparing their predicted sequences in D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, and D. subobscura. Between orthologs, i.e., pairs of either sry beta or sry delta, the NH2-proximal region delineated by pairs of C-X2-C motifs and the DNA-binding finger domain are highly conserved. Sequence conservation operates over the entire finger domain, including the links separating adjacent fingers, even though each has a unique sequence different from the widespread TGEKP motif. In contrast, the sequence of the central acidic region has extensively diverged and differs between species in the number of amino acids, probably because of slippage-driven mutations. The NH2-terminal region and fingers 1, 5, and 6 differentiate the sry beta and delta proteins while zinc fingers 2, 3, and 4 are virtually identical in these two paralogs. A nuclear localization signal of the SV40T antigen type, preceded by a potential CKII phosphorylation regulatory site, is conserved in sry delta but not found in sry beta. The interspecific conserved regions correlate well with the positions of zygotic lethal mutations in the D. melanogaster sry delta protein. Furthermore, P-element transformation experiments show that a transgenic copy of the D. pseudoobscura sry delta gene rescues the sry delta mutant phenotype. Convergence of genetic and structural data on the sry proteins supports a multimodular function and mode of evolution of these C2H2 finger proteins.",1994,"P Ferrer, M Crozatier, C Salles, A Vincent, P Ferrer, M Crozatier, C Salles, A Vincent"
Phenotypic expression of ADH regulatory genes in Drosophila melanogaster: a comparative study between a paleartic and a tropical population,7729695,10.1007/BF01429218,"In vitro ADH activity was studied in D. melanogaster males from two sets of third chromosome substitution lines, one from a paleartic population (Gigean, France), the other from a tropical population (Brazzaville, Congo). As a linear model with raw ADH activity dependent on fresh weight was significant in both sets of lines, the raw activity was adjusted by regression on weight. Two main results were found: (a) the well-known substantial intrapopulation variability; and (b) third chromosome geographical origin did not affect the mean ADH activity. Unlike the structural Adh gene polymorphism which allows the two populations to be distinguished, the polymorphism of the third chromosome ADH regulatory genes (or more exactly their phenotypic expression) does not allow to discriminate between them. These results are discussed in the context of the adaptation of D. melanogaster to the alcoholic substrates in light of a model proposed by Hedrick and McDonald (1980) in order to interpret variations in both structural and regulatory gene polymorphisms.",1994,"H MerÃ§ot, H MerÃ§ot"
Genetic analysis of Stellate elements of Drosophila melanogaster,7896100,,"Repeated elements are remarkably important for male meiosis and spermiogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Pairing of the X and Y chromosomes is mediated by the ribosomal RNA genes of the Y chromosome and X chromosome heterochromatin, spermiogenesis depends on the fertility factors of the Y chromosome. Intriguingly, a peculiar genetic system of interaction between the Y-linked crystal locus and the X-linked Stellate elements seem to be also involved in male meiosis and spermiogenesis. Deletion of the crystal element of the Y, via an interaction with the Stellate elements of the X, causes meiotic abnormalities, gamete-genotype dependent failure of sperm development (meiotic drive), and deposition of protein crystals in spermatocytes. The current hypothesis is that the meiotic abnormalities observed in cry- males is due to an induced overexpression of the normally repressed Ste elements. An implication of this hypothesis is that the strength of the abnormalities would depend on the amount of the Ste copies. To test this point we have genetically and cytologically examined the relationship of Ste copy number and organization to meiotic behavior in cry- males. We found that heterochromatic as well as euchromatic Ste repeats are functional and that the abnormality in chromosome condensation and the frequency of nondisjunction are related to Ste copy number. Moreover, we found that meiosis is disrupted after synapsis and that cry-induced meiotic drive is probably not mediated by Ste.",1994,"G Palumbo, S Bonaccorsi, L G Robbins, S Pimpinelli, G Palumbo, S Bonaccorsi, L G Robbins, S Pimpinelli"
Activity of aromatic amines in the eye: w/w+ somatic assay of Drosophila melanogaster,8050419,10.1002/em.2850240110,"Aromatic amines represent a category of classical environmental hazards which require biotransformation in order to exert their mutagenic and carcinogenic effects.

The predicted protein structure, based on the hydropathy profile and placement of key aa residues, reveals a seven-transmembrane structure typical of a rhodopsin. Unlike the previously characterised insect visual pigments which have 3-hydroxy retinal in their binding sites, mantid rhodopsin contains 11-cis retinal.

Conservation of wingless patterning functions in the short-germ embryos of Tribolium castaneum,8107804,10.1038/367460a0,"During embryogenesis, all insects reach a conserved, or phylotypic, stage at which all future segments are present. Different insects, however, arrive at this stage by overtly different pathways. In the long-germ insect Drosophila melanogaster, segmentation of the entire embryo occurs nearly simultaneously and results from the action of a cascade of transcriptional regulatory factors that operate in the acellular environment of the syncytial blastoderm. In short-germ insects, segmentation occurs in an anterior-to-posterior sequence, within a cellular environment, and might then be dependent on intercellular signalling. To compare the molecular mechanisms of segmentation, we have isolated a homologue of the Drosophila wingless gene, a mediator of cell-cell communications, from the short-germ beetle Tribolium castaneum. The principal features of wingless expression patterns in Drosophila are conserved in Tribolium, including its early deployment in rostral and caudal domains in the blastoderm, its segmental iteration in cells immediately anterior to cells expressing the engrailed gene, and its later restriction to a ventral sector of the developing appendages.",1994,"L M Nagy, S Carroll, L M Nagy, S Carroll"

Relationship between benzo(a)pyrene-DNA adducts and somatic mutation and recombination in Drosophila melanogaster,8162890,10.1002/em.2850230304,"The evaluation of the relationship between the dose to DNA of a mutagen/carcinogen and in vivo somatic cell mutagenesis may provide information on the mechanisms leading to induced mutational events. This can be achieved, for example, by coupling test systems that permit the detection of somatic mutation and recombination on the basis of phenotypic changes in cuticular structures of Drosophila melanogaster, with methods for the quantitation of carcinogen-DNA adducts such as the 32P-postlabeling technique. In this article, we evaluate the quantitative relationship between BaP-DNA adduct formation, determined by 32P-postlabeling, and the induction of mutant cells in the wing marker version of the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster. The total single clones in the trans-heterozygous mwh/flr3 flies show a linear relationship with the BaP-DNA adduct levels, suggesting a single hit mechanism for the genetic damage giving rise to this type of clones. In contrast, the twin clones (which are of recombinational origin) display a linear-quadratic relationship with the adduct levels, suggesting that multiple hits may be involved in generating these clones. The total single clones in the mwh/TM3, Ser flies (in which mitotic recombination is suppressed) show a logarithmic relationship with the adduct levels. The discussion of these data in terms of the pathways that may be involved in the repair of the BaP-DNA adducts leads to the suggestion that in Drosophila melanogaster the repair of Bap metabolite-DNA adducts in somatic cells may proceed, in large part, via post-replicative recombinational repair.",1994,"M Zordan, M Osti, S Pavanello, R Costa, A G Levis, M Zordan, M Osti, S Pavanello, R Costa, A G Levis"

Evolutionary inferences from DNA variation at the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase locus in natural populations of drosophila: selection and geographic differentiation,8138153,,"Several allozyme-coding genes in Drosophila melanogaster show patterns suggesting that polymorphisms at these loci are targets of balancing selection. An important question is whether these genes have similar distributions of underlying DNA sequence variation which would indicate similar evolutionary processes occurring in this class of loci. One such locus, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Pgd), has previously been shown to exhibit clinal variation for Fast/Slow electromorph variation in the United States and Australia, unusually large electromorph frequency differences between the United States and Africa, and other patterns indicative of selection. We measured four-cutter DNA restriction site and allozyme variation at Pgd among 142 D. melanogaster X chromosomes collected from several geographic regions including North Carolina, California, and Zimbabwe (Africa). We also sequenced a representative sample of 13 D. melanogaster Pgd genes collected in North Carolina and a single copy of Pgd from the sibling species, Drosophila simulans. While some population genetic models predict excess DNA polymorphism in genes which are targets of balancing selection, the D. melanogaster samples from the United States had significantly reduced levels of DNA polymorphism and extraordinarily high levels of linkage disequilibrium, providing evidence of hitchhiking effects of advantageous mutants at Pgd or at linked sites. Therefore, while selection has probably influenced the distribution of DNA variation at Pgd, the precise nature of these selective events remains obscure. Since the Pgd region appears to have low rates of crossing over, the reduced level of variation at this locus supports the idea that recombination rates are important determinants of levels of DNA polymorphism in natural populations. Furthermore, while patterns of allozyme variation are very similar at Pgd and Adh, the DNA data show that the evolutionary histories of these genes are dramatically different. We observed extensive differences in the amount and distribution of variation in D. melanogaster Pgd samples from the United States and Zimbabwe which cannot be explained by differential selection on the Fast/Slow polymorphism in these two geographic regions. Thus, genetic drift among partially isolated populations has also been an important factor in determining the distribution of variation at Pgd in D. melanogaster. Finally, we assayed four-cutter variation at Pgd in a sample of 19 D. simulans X chromosomes and observed reduced levels of DNA variability and high levels of linkage disequilibrium. These patterns are consistent with predictions of some hitchhiking models.",1994,"D J Begun, C F Aquadro, D J Begun, C F Aquadro"
"Genetic control of early embryogenesis in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum",11540629,10.1093/icb/34.3.343,"The power of genetic analysis possible with the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has yielded a detailed understanding of pattern formation controlled by homeotic and segmentation genes in early embryogenesis. We are studying the genetic regulation of embryogenesis in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. The dynamic process of germ rudiment formation and sequential segmentation exhibited by Tribolium provides a context different than Drosophila within which to assess the function of homeotic and segmentation gene homologs. Our analyses of the genes in the HOM-C suggest many similarities in structure and function with the well-characterized Drosophila genes. Abdominal resembles its Drosophila homolog abdominal-A in functioning to establish segmental identities in the abdomen, such that in each case mutations result in homeotic transformations to PS6. Although the anterior functional boundary of abdominal-A homologs is precisely conserved, the domain within which Abdominal is important extends more posterior than that of abdominal-A. The final expression pattern of the segmentation gene engrailed in Tribolium is identical to Drosophila, suggesting that these homologs are involved in a conserved developmental process. However, as expected the development of that pattern is different; engrailed stripes anticipate the formation of each new segment as they appear sequentially in the elongating germ band. Although the grasshopper even-skipped and fushi tarazu homologs are not apparently important in segmentation, the expression patterns of the Tribolium homologs strongly suggest that they have gained a role in segmentation in the lineage leading to beetles and flies. Nevertheless, differences between Tribolium and Drosophila in the dynamics of even-skipped expression and the fushi tarazu mutant phenotype indicate divergence in the regulation and roles of these genes.",1994,"S J Brown, J K Parrish, R E Denell, R W Beeman, S J Brown, J K Parrish, R E Denell, R W Beeman"
Position-effect variegation and z1 mediated white repression in the In(1)wis system in Drosophila melanogaster,8144360,10.1111/j.1601-5223.1993.00209.x,"We have characterized a new X-chromosomal inversion in Drosophila melanogaster, extending from just distal of white to just proximal of the bb locus. The inversion places the w-isoxanthopterinless (wis) allele close to heterochromatin and under the influence of position-effect variegation (PEV). The wis gene activity is also regulated by chromosome pairing-dependent z1-mediated repression. By changing the environment, using specific second site modifiers, altering the amount of heterochromatin, and disturbing the chromosome pairing, we have been able to separately affect the two regulatory phenomena and analyse their respective impact on the wis regulation. We provide evidence that under normal conditions PEV and z1 mediated white repression are additive. However, at extreme levels of wis repression by PEV, changes in the z1-mediated interactions are not observable. This indicates that PEV is epistatic to z1-mediated regulation of wis. We also show that deficiencies in the short arm of Y act as suppressors of the z1-mediated white repression. This suppression does not influence PEV and is thus not due to the lower amount of heterochromatin. We propose that nonhomologous chromosome pairing between X and Y is important for the synapsis-dependent z1-mediated repression of white transcription activity in this system.",1993,"A Rasmuson-Lestander, J Larsson, B Rasmuson, A Rasmuson-Lestander, J Larsson, B Rasmuson"

Where checked (D. pseudoobscura), a positive correlation was found between the amount of cytoplasm injected and the number of pattern elements formed, suggesting threshold effects upon target genes as with the endogenous bcd product. By polymerase chain reaction, fragments from a bcd-orthologous homeobox were cloned from the three blowfly species. The derived sequence of 43 amino acids was identical in all blowflies and the housefly but differed at 4 positions from the orthologous D. melanogaster sequence. Localization of the mRNA recognized by the respective fragments in the blowflies Lucilia and Phormia resembled that known from D. melanogaster, while Calliphora - the blowfly species lacking rescue activity -showed remarkable differences of localization in both ovarian follicles and the deposited egg cell. This surprising divergence within a morphologically rather uniform family of cyclorrhaphic dipterans should be of interest from both functional and evolutionary points of view.",1993,"R SchrÃ¶der, K Sander"
Individual repeats of Drosophila Myb can function in transformation by v-Myb,8230457,10.1128/JVI.67.12.7332-7339.1993,"The v-Myb protein binds to specific DNA sequences and can regulate gene expression. The DNA-binding domain of v-Myb contains the second and third of the three highly conserved tandem repeats found in c-Myb. In general, the ability of mutant forms of v-Myb to transform correlates with their ability to trans activate transcription. Two mutations within the DNA-binding domain of v-Myb which preserve DNA binding in vitro but fail to trans activate or transform have been described. These results suggested that this highly conserved domain might function in specific protein-protein interactions, as well as in DNA binding. We therefore tested the ability of a related protein domain from Drosophila melanogaster to substitute functionally for the homologous region of v-Myb. We found that either the second or third repeat of Drosophila Myb, but not both, could function in trans-activation and transformation by v-Myb. The hybrid containing both the second and third repeats of Drosophila Myb bound to DNA but failed to trans activate transcription either in the context of v-Myb or as a v-Myb-VP16 fusion protein. These results demonstrate that although the protein-DNA contacts made by the Myb repeats have been conserved during the evolution of animals, the protein-protein interactions have diverged.",1993,"X Bin, J S Lipsick, X Bin, J S Lipsick"
Spontaneous mutation for a quantitative trait in Drosophila melanogaster. II. Distribution of mutant effects on the trait and fitness,8319901,10.1017/s0016672300031220,"Starting from a completely homozygous population of Drosophila melanogaster, lines have been derived and subjected to 47 generations of divergent selection for abdominal bristle number (20 lines selected in each direction) or to 60-67 generations of inbreeding (100 B lines maintained by a single brother-sister mating, 100 C lines maintained by two double first cousin matings). In the selected lines, 25 were identified carrying at least 30 mutations affecting bristle number. A large fraction of these mutations (42%) were lethals. Non-lethal mutations had smaller effects on the trait, were predominantly additive and had no detectable pleiotropic effects on fitness. In the inbred lines, 21 mutations affecting bristles were individually analysed. Deleterious mutations had the largest effects on the trait (irrespective of sign) and showed recessive gene action (complete or incomplete). The rest were predominantly additive and had smaller effects. Thus, both procedures identify a quasi-neutral class of additive mutations which should be close to that responsible for standing variation in natural populations. Moreover, the results indicate a leptokurtic distribution of mutant effects, consistent with a model of natural selection acting on bristles through pleiotropic effects of pertinent loci on fitness. Consequently, neutral additive alleles of considerable effect can be found segregating at intermediate frequencies in natural populations.",1993,"M A LÃ³pez, C LÃ³pez-Fanjul, M A LÃ³pez, C LÃ³pez-Fanjul"
Drosophila melanogaster male germ line-specific transcripts with autosomal and Y-linked genes,8514138,,"We have identified of set of related transcripts expressed in the germ line of male Drosophila melanogaster. Surprisingly, while one of the corresponding genes is autosomal the remainder are located on the Y chromosome. The autosomal locus, at 77F on chromosome arm 3L, corresponds to the previously described transcription unit 18c, located in the first intron of the gene for an RI subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The Y chromosome copies have been mapped to region h18-h19 on the cytogenetic map of the Y outside of any of the regions required for male fertility. In contrast to D. melanogaster, where Y-linked copies were found in nine different wild-type strains, no Y-linked copies were found in sibling species. Several apparently Y-derived cDNA clones and one Y-linked genomic clone have been sequenced. The Y-derived genomic DNA shares the same intron/exon structure as the autosomal copy as well as related flanking sequences suggesting that it transposed to the Y from the autosomal locus. However, this particular Y-linked copy cannot encode a functional polypeptide due to a stop codon at amino acid position 72. Divergence among five different cDNA clones ranges from 1.5 to 6% and includes a large number of third position substitutions. We have not yet obtained a full-length cDNA from a Y-linked gene and therefore cannot conclude that the D. melanogaster Y chromosome contains functional protein-coding genes. The autosomal gene encodes a predicted polypeptide with 45% similarity to histones of the H5 class and more limited similarity to cysteine-rich protamines. This protein may be a distant relative of the histone H1 family perhaps involved in sperm chromatin condensation.",1993,"S R Russell, K Kaiser, S R Russell, K Kaiser"
Pigment-dispersing hormone-immunoreactive neurons in the nervous system of wild-type Drosophila melanogaster and of several mutants with altered circadian rhythmicity,8276996,10.1002/cne.903370202,"Antisera against the crustacean pigment-dispersing hormone (beta-PDH) were used in immunocytochemical preparations to investigate the anatomy of PDH-immunoreactive neurons in the nervous system of wild-type Drosophila melanogaster and in that of several brain mutants of this species, some of which express altered circadian rhythmicity. In the wild-type and in all rhythmic mutants (small optic lobes, sine oculis, small optic lobes; sine oculis), eight cell bodies at the anterior base of the medulla (PDFMe neurons) exhibit intense PDH-like immunoreactivity. Four of the eight somata are large and four are smaller. The four large PDFMe neurons have wide tangential arborizations in the medulla and send axons via the posterior optic tract to the contralateral medulla. Fibers from the four small PDFMe neurons ramify in the median protocerebrum dorsal to the calyces of the mushroom bodies. Their terminals are adjacent to other PDH-immunoreactive somata (PDFCa neurons) which send axons via the median bundle into the tritocerebrum. The results suggest a possible involvement of the PDFMe neurons in the circadian pacemaking system of Drosophila. The location and size of the PDFMe neurons are identical with those of neurons containing the period protein which is essential for circadian rhythmicity. Changes in the arborizations of the PDFMe neurons in small optic lobes; sine oculis mutants are suited to explain the splitting in the locomotor rhythm of these flies. In the arrhythmic mutant, disconnected, the PDFMe neurons are absent. The arrhythmic mutant per0, however, shows normal PDH immunoreactivity and therefore, does not prevent the expression of PDH-like peptides in these neurons.",1993,"C Helfrich-FÃ¶rster, U Homberg, C Helfrich-FÃ¶rster, U Homberg"

All six genes are, in fact, arranged in a tightly linked cluster spanning a DNA segment of only 11 kb. With the exception of ng-4, all the clustered genes are highly expressed only during the larval life and share the same tissue-specificity, being mainly transcribed within the salivary glands. In addition, two members of the cluster, ng-1 and ng-2, show a very high degree of sequence homology, clearly indicating that they are related to each other by means of a duplication event. Interestingly to note, the entire cluster shows a peculiar genomic location, extending across two introns of the memory gene dunce, a large gene of Drosophila whose organization has proved to be remarkably complex.",1993,"M Furia, P P D'Avino, S Crispi, D Artiaco, L C Polito, M Furia, P P D'Avino, S Crispi, D Artiaco, L C Polito"

Wavelength-dependent effects of light on magnetic compass orientation in Drosophila melanogaster,8510055,10.1007/BF00216612,"1. Wildtype Oregon-R Drosophila melanogaster were trained in the ambient magnetic field to a horizontal gradient of 365 nm light emanating from one of the 4 cardinal compass directions and were subsequently tested in a visually-symmetrical, radial 8-arm maze in which the magnetic field alignment could be varied. When tested under 365 nm light, flies exhibited consistent magnetic compass orientation in the direction from which light had emanated in training. 2. When the data were analyzed by sex, males exhibited a strong and consistent magnetic compass response while females were randomly oriented with respect to the magnetic field. 3. When tested under 500 nm light of the same quantal flux, females were again randomly oriented with respect to the magnetic field, while males exhibited a 90 degree clockwise shift in magnetic compass orientation relative to the trained direction. 4. This wavelength-dependent shift in the direction of magnetic compass orientation suggests that Drosophila may utilize a light-dependent magnetic compass similar to that demonstrated previously in an amphibian. However, the data do not exclude the alternative hypothesis that a change in the wavelength of light has a non-specific effect on the flies' behavior, i.e., causing the flies to exhibit a different form of magnetic orientation behavior.",1993,"J B Phillips, O Sayeed, J B Phillips, O Sayeed"

In agreement with theory, larger responses in each direction were achieved by those lines selected at greater effective population sizes. A large fraction of mutations were lethals (10/30).

Paraquat selection identifies X-linked oxygen defense genes in Drosophila melanogaster,8458566,10.1139/g93-021,"We have previously shown that homozygous mutants of Drosophila melanogaster deficient in the oxygen radical scavengers, CuZn superoxide dismutase or urate, are adult viable and yet hypersensitive to the oxygen radical-generating agent, paraquat. Thus, paraquat could be used as a selective agent to identify adult-viable mutants potentially defective in other, perhaps unknown, oxygen defense functions. Here we report the successful use of paraquat hypersensitivity in the isolation of X-linked, ethylmethanesulfonate-induced mutations affecting oxygen defense in Drosophila melanogaster. Two paraquat hypersensitive mutants were identified that, by complementation analysis, were shown to be new alleles of the maroon-like gene. In addition to paraquat hypersensitivity, both alleles confer a maternally affected dark brown eye color and a complete lack of enzymatically active xanthine dehydrogenase, both of which are characteristic phenotypes of known maroon-like alleles. We conclude that the lack of xanthine dehydrogenase in these mutants leads to the absence of urate, which is the proximate cause of paraquat sensitivity. Because our search for such mutants on the X chromosome revealed two alleles of only a single selectable gene, we anticipate that the total number of major oxygen defense genes in the complete Drosophila genome may not be large.",1993,"J M Humphreys, A J Hilliker, J P Phillips, J M Humphreys, A J Hilliker, J P Phillips"

We show here the existence of two additional regions which confer female fat body-specific expression on an Adh reporter gene and on the native yp2 gene, respectively. This suggests some redundancy in the regulation of expression of the yp genes. Computer searches for putative binding sites for the DSX protein, which regulates sex-specific expression of the yp genes, revealed several such sites in our constructs. However, the significance of these is unclear since many such sites also occur in genes which one would not expect to be regulated in a sex-specific manner (e.g. Adh, Actin 5C).

Toxicity and pathology of crude broth filtrate produced by Hirsutella thompsonii var. thompsonii in shake culture,8463709,10.1006/jipa.1993.1025,"Metabolic products secreted by the fungal mycelia of Hirsutella thompsonii var. thompsonii (CBS 556.77D) in a defined culture broth in shake culture were tested for toxicity to Galleria mellonella larvae and Drosophila melanogaster adults via injection and per os application, respectively. In addition, the toxic effect of broth filtrate was observed in vitro in a cell line of Bombyx mori. Czapek-Dox broth fortified with 1% yeast extract stimulated more rapid mycelial growth and correspondingly more toxin production in time. At 25-30 degrees C, metabolic toxin(s) was detected in broth via bioassay at about 4-5 days postinoculation when mycelial biomass reached 5 mg/ml (dry wt). At these temperatures, biological activity of the filtrate peaked at about 8-10 days when mycelial growth reached a maximum (10 mg/ml, dry wt). This suggests a positive relationship between toxic metabolite and mycelial production. After 10 days, the toxicity of the filtrate appeared to decline gradually. Pathogenicity symptoms of the metabolites developed slowly in both G. mellonella and D. melanogaster. Early signs of lethargy appeared at 4 days postinjection and cumulative mortality of G. mellonella larvae was low after 1 week; however, the percentage of mortality reached 98-100% after 14 days.

However, previous studies have not detected cross-hybridization between the DNA of Drosophila melanogaster and the terminal DNA sequences of any of several organisms tested. Recently, the first terminal DNA clone from a multicellular invertebrate, that of Ascaris lumbricoides, was reported also to consist of a tandem reiteration of a short sequence similar to those previously identified for other eukaryotes.

For the benomyl preparation (Benlate) and the mancozebe preparation (Dithane M45), there was an overall reduction of the egg mass on treated media but not on untreated media. There appears to be an essential repulsive effect which perturbs egg laying and causes a retention of eggs. However, after 3 to 4 weeks the quantity of egg mass also diminished on untreated media. Once the treatment was terminated the capacity to lay eggs partially returned. The copper sulfate preparation (Bouillie bordelaise) also exhibited a repulsive effect as exhibited by a retention of a certain number of eggs, but there was a more direct and fast effect on fecundity. Effect was more brutal with the dichlofluanide preparation (EuparÃ¨ne), and rapidly irreversible: the egg masses were very reduced after only one week of treatment on both treated and untreated media, and after termination of treatment there was an incomplete and temporary recuperation of the capacity to lay eggs. The results presented here are in agreement with those obtained previously concerning longevity.

(3) Noncoding introns and 3' and 5' flanking DNA shows less polymorphism than silent sites within coding DNA. (4) X-linked genes are less variable than autosomal genes. (5) Transition (Ts) and transversion (Tv) polymorphisms are about equally frequent in non-coding DNA and at fourfold degenerate sites in coding DNA while Ts polymorphisms outnumber Tv polymorphisms by about 2:1 in total coding DNA. The increased Ts polymorphism in coding regions is likely due to the structure of the genetic code: silent changes are more often Ts's than are replacement substitutions. (6) The proportion of replacement polymorphisms is significantly higher in D. melanogaster than in D. simulans. (7) The level of variation in coding DNA and the adjacent noncoding DNA is significantly correlated indicating regional effects, most notably recombination. (8) Surprisingly, the level of polymorphism at silent coding sites in D. melanogaster is positively correlated with degree of codon usage bias. (9) Three proposed tests of the neutral theory of DNA polymorphisms have been performed on the data: Tajima's test, the HKA test, and the McDonald-Kreitman test. About half of the loci fail to conform to the expectations of neutral theory by one of the tests. We conclude that many variables are affecting levels of DNA polymorphism in Drosophila, from properties of nucleotides to population history and, perhaps, mating structure. No simple, all encompassing explanation satisfactorily accounts for the data.",1996,"E N Moriyama, J R Powell, E N Moriyama, J R Powell"
Daily rhythms in cells of the fly's optic lobe: taking time out from the circadian clock,8799974,10.1016/S0166-2236(96)10033-3,"Considerable progress has recently been reported in locating the cellular basis and molecular mechanisms of the circadian clock in the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster. To advance beyond the clock, towards the outputs that lie between the clock itself and the circadian rhythms in behaviour that it regulates, will present new challenges. This is because most behaviours are generated by complex neuronal circuits, which are themselves difficult to unravel. Recently described anatomical changes in the optic lobe of the related housefly, Musca domestica, exhibit a circadian rhythm that is, by contrast, relatively easy to assay. This rhythm is apparently controlled by at least two sets of diffuse modulatory neurones. One of these, immunoreactive to the peptide pigment-dispersing hormone, also expresses in Drosophila the product of the period (per) gene, the most widely studied of the so-called clock genes that are essential for the correct expression of circadian rhythmicity. The second, called LBO5HT, is immunoreactive to 5-HT, a widely invoked transmitter system in insect circadian rhythms. The identification of these elements, and a widening cascade of events which their actions apparently trigger, opens up new opportunities to examine old problems in the regulation of circadian rhythms in the nervous system.",1996,"I A Meinertzhagen, E Pyza, I A Meinertzhagen, E Pyza"
Rapid activation of calcium-sensitive Na+/H+ exchange induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone in salivary gland cells of Drosophila melanogaster,8822267,10.1016/0303-7207(95)03699-7,"Ecdysteroids play an important role in the larval moulting process of insects. 20-Hydroxyecdysone (20E) causes the induction of specific 'puffs' in polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster salivary gland cells. Although it is known that inorganic ions control pretranscriptional processes in the cell nucleus, the intracellular mechanisms of gene activation are still unclear. Therefore, we examined the effects of 20E on plasma membrane ion transport of Drosophila melanogaster salivary gland cells. Isolated glands of the third larval stage were superfused with a solution mimicking the haemolymph. The relative K+ conductance of the cell membrane (tK+) was measured with microelectrodes by performing ion substitution experiments. Under control conditions tK+ averaged to 0.16 + 0.02 (n = 15). Addition of 5 x 10(-6) M 20E increased tK+ within 2 min by 19.1 +/- 4.2% (n = 15). This rapid response to 20E was elicited only in the presence of calcium. Moreover, starting from a steady-state intracellular pH of 7.20-7.60, 20E induced a rise in cytoplasmic pH by 0.27 +/- 0.06 (n = 6) within minutes. Amiloride (10(-3) M), a blocker of plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchange, prevented the 20E-induced intracellular alkalinization. We conclude that 20E activates a calcium-sensitive plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchange leading to a rise of plasma membrane K+ conductance and intracellular alkalinization both being prerequisites for steroid hormone induced gene activation.",1996,"S Schneider, S WÃ¼nsch, A Schwab, H Oberleithner, S Schneider, S WÃ¼nsch, A Schwab, H Oberleithner"
Large deletions induced in the white gene of Drosophila melanogaster by the antitumoral drug cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum(II): influence of non-homologous recombination,8841485,10.1016/0027-5107(96)00059-0,"We have studied two mutants carrying large deletions induced in the white gene of Drosophila by the antitumoral drug cisplatin. The breakpoints of the deletions were located by southern analysis and the sequences of the deletion junctions were determined. Two base-pair repeats are associated with the ends of these deletions; one of the repeats is preserved in the new junction after the deletion. DNA sequences such as A-T rich, alternating purine/pyrimidine tracts, polypurine-polypyrimidine tracts and topoisomerase I and II cleavage sites are found near the junctions.

"Conditioned visual flight orientation in Drosophila: dependence on age, practice, and diet",10456076,10.1101/lm.3.1.49,"Orientation preferences for visual patterns can be conditioned in tethered flies (Drosophila melanogaster) at the flight simulator. In a reversal conditioning procedure using heat as reinforcement, flies can be trained to successively prefer different flight orientations with respect to the patterns. As in many learning paradigms, conditioned responses are highly variable. Although during training most flies reliably avoid the heat and the corresponding flight orientations, in subsequent learning tests without heat some show no consistent preference for the permissive orientations. We have started to investigate the interindividual differences in learning performance and describe here three significant variables: the age of the animals, their experience in the flight simulator prior to the experiment, and the composition of the fly food. Flies learn more reliably at 3-4 days than at 1-2 days of age but learning indices do not increase further in even older flies. Learning is improved if flies are allowed to become familiar with the flight simulator before the start of the conditioning procedure. Most important, poor nutrition causes complete amnesia within three or four generations. The reverse shift from poor to nutritious food restores learning ability with an even longer delay.",1996,"A Guo, L Li, S Z Xia, C H Feng, R Wolf, M Heisenberg, A Guo, L Li, S Z Xia, C H Feng, R Wolf, M Heisenberg"
"Morewright (mwr), a new meiotic mutant of Drosophila melanogaster affecting nonexchange chromosome segregation",8978058,,"A new meiotic mutation, morewright (mwr) was identified by screening for new mutations that act as dominant enhancers of the dosage-sensitive Drosophila melanogaster female meiotic mutant, nodDTW.mwr is a recessive meiotic mutant, specifically impairing the segregation of nonexchange chromosomes. Cytological evidence suggests that the meiotic defect in mwr/mwr females is in homologue recognition because the chromosomes appear to be misaligned on an intact spindle. The mwr mutation was recovered during a screen of random P-element insertions on a chromosome with a single insertion located at 50C. The P-element insertion is a recessive female-sterile mutation. While excision of the P element from the mwr-bearing chromosome partially relieves the female sterility, the excisions retain the dominant nodDTW-enhancing activity. The mwr meiotic phenotype maps very close to the female-sterile P insertion. Thus the mwr locus appears to encode a function required for partner recognition in meiosis, although its relationship to the neighboring female-sterile mutation remains to be elucidated.",1996,"R S Rasooly, R S Rasooly"
Comparison of an Esterase Associated with Organophosphate Resistance in Lucilia cuprina with an Orthologue Not Associated with Resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,8980033,10.1006/pest.1996.0038,"Orthologous E3 and EST23 carboxylesterases have been enriched over 200-fold from organophosphate (OP) susceptible strains of Lucilia cuprina and Drosophila melanogaster, respectively. Mutants of E3 are associated with OP resistance but no resistance mutations of EST23 are known. The behaviours of the two enzymes were very similar during purification which involved differential centrifugation followed by three or four ion exchange and gel filtration chromatographic steps. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and histochemical staining for esterase activity revealed no other esterases in the enriched material. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (native followed by denaturing) showed that a major 70-kDa component of each preparation comigrates with E3 and EST23 activities, respectively. Kinetic properties of the enzymes are also very similar. Estimates of Km, Kcat, and Kcat/Km for alpha-naphthyl acetate are 42 Â± 18 &mu;M, 19 sec-1, and 4.6 x 10(5) M-1 sec-1, respectively, for E3, and 62 Â± 25 &mu;M, 23 sec-1, and 3.7 x 10(5) M-1 sec-1, for EST23. Both enzymes are potently inhibited by dibrom and less potently by another OP, diisopropylflurophosphate. E3 is also potently inhibited by paraoxon, whereas EST23 is at least 8-fold less susceptible to inhibition by paraoxon. This supports previous analyses of crude homogenates which showed that E3 is more susceptible to inhibition by paraoxon and fenitrooxon than is EST23 or the target site for OP action, acetylcholinesterase. It is proposed that the unusual affinity of E3 for such OPs is a necessary precondition for mutations that enable it to confer OP resistance on L. cuprina.",1996,"AG Parker, PM Campbell, ME Spackman, RJ Russell, JG Oakeshott, AG Parker, PM Campbell, ME Spackman, RJ Russell, JG Oakeshott"
Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of the Drosophila melanogaster olfactory mutation Indifferent,8978046,,"Two Drosophila melanogaster third chromosomes carrying the EMS-induced mutations IndifferentA (IndfA) and IndifferentB (IndfB), previously isolated from larvae showing an anosmia when stimulated with nonanol, were recombined with a multi-marked chromosome in order to localize the mutant character(s). Recombinant strains were tested for their larval olfactory responses and classed as either mutant or wild type; both Indf characters were found to be located on the right arm of the chromosome, between ebony and claret. Deletion mapping suggests that the Indifferent wild-type character is a haplo-insufficiency and that IndfA and IndfB are located in cytological region 96A2-7. Deficiencies and both mutant strains were tested with 14 closely related odors (alcohols, acetates, acids and methyl esters, between eight and 10 carbons long). When stimulated with methyl octanoate, IndfA and IndfB appeared recessive; noncomplementation was observed for this phenotype in IndfA/IndfB hybrids indicating that the two characters are allelic. The overall responses of IndfA, IndfB and the deficiencies indicate that Indf is involved in processing organic odors of between eight and 10 carbons in length.",1996,"M Cobb, M Cobb"

Ingestion of this non-hereditary virus early in the life-cycle has a positive effect. Demographic parameters measured on DCV-free and DCV-infected populations of the same genotype enabled us to compute the population growth rates (multiplication rates) by means of matrix models. The DCV-infected sample had a larger growth rate both for low and high larval densities. Since it is not possible to experiment on a mixed population where DCV-free and DCV-infected individuals live together, a model combining competition and contamination was used. Simulations showed that coexistence of free and infected animals can occur. Such a result leads us to question the relation between population growth rate and fitness.",1996,"M Thomas-Orillard, S Legendre, M Thomas-Orillard, S Legendre"
"The accessory gland proteins in male Drosophila: structural, reproductive, and evolutionary aspects",8698082,10.1007/BF01969718,"Recent results from biochemical and molecular genetic studies of the accessory gland proteins in male Drosophila are reviewed. The most prominent feature is the species-specific variability. However, the analysis of the sex peptide in D. melanogaster shows that there is a strong homology in the molecular structure to the closely related sibling species, and that divergence increases with increasing phylogenetic distance. For this reason the sex peptide, after being transferred to the female genital tract during copulation, reduces receptivity and increases oviposition only in virgin females belonging to the same species group and subgroup. Even though studies were hitherto limited to a small number of the secretory components, it is evident that the accessory gland proteins play a key role in reproductive success of the fruit fly by changing female sexual behavior, supporting sperm transfer, storage and displacement. Thus, genes encoding the accessory gland proteins are apparently under strong evolutionary selection.",1996,"P S Chen, P S Chen"
The colonization of organges by the cosmopolitan Drosophila,28307873,10.1007/BF00333733,"The guild of ""cosmopolitan"" Drosophila coexist almost worldwide and yet the mechanisms that underlie this coexistence are unknown. The larval resource of the guild is decaying fruit and vegetables, but the species show little specialization and can coexist on a single resource, such as oranges. In southern California the guild includes D. simulans (SIM), D. melanogaster (MEL), D. pseudoobscura (OBS), D. immigrans (IMM), D. hydei (HYD) and D. busckii (BUS). These species show consistent differences in their colonization of decaying organges, differences that may promote their coexistence. This study tested whether the colonization pattern of a species is determined primarily by attraction to specific resource types (decayed or fresh organges), by ability to colonize new resource patches, or by dependence on a successional sequence of Drosophila species. The experiments compared oranges that were pre-aged prior to a colonization period and showed that the colonization pattern of each species (except OBS) was driven primarily by its decay-dependent attraction to oranges. While OBS exhibited a pattern of colonization independent of pre-aging, the remaining species all showed some preference for older (7-day pre-aged) over fresh oranges. Their overall pattern of attraction, ordered by high relative abundance on fresher organges, was SIM>MEL=IMM>HYD=BUS. BUS, a specialist on decaying plant material, was the only species that showed a preference for 11-day over 7-day oranges. Pre-aging the oranges under covers, to prevent prior colonization by Drosophila, did not change the interspecific pattern of colonization, indicating that microbial decay was driving the changes in attraction. The patterns of attraction separated two ecologically similar pairs (SIM from MEL; IMM from HYD) and published data on ethanol tolerance show that, in each pair, the earliest colonizer has the lower tolerance. This suggests an important interplay between colonization patterns and physiological optima.",1996,"Leonard Nunney, Leonard Nunney"

Sternopleural is a regulatory mutation of wingless with both dominant and recessive effects on larval development of Drosophila melanogaster,8846894,,The Drosophila wingless (wg) gene encodes a secreted signaling protein that is required for many separate patterning events in both embryonic and larval development. wg functions in the development of the adult structures have been studied using the conditional mutant wgts and also using regulatory mutations of wg that reduce larval functions. Here we present evidence that Sternopleural (Sp) is another regulatory allele of wg that affects a subset of larval functions. Sp has both a recessive loss-of-function component and a gain-of-function component. The loss-of-function component reflects a reduction of wg activity in the notum and in the antenna. The gain-of-function component apparently leads to ectopic wg activity in the dorsal first and second leg disc and thereby generates the dominant Sp phenotype. Sp and other wg alleles show a complex pattern of complementation. We present evidence that these genetic properties are due to transvection. These results have implications for the genetic definition of a null allele at loci subject to transvection.,1996,"C J Neumann, S M Cohen, C J Neumann, S M Cohen"
Differential incorporation of cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives into ecdysteroids by the larval ring glands and adult ovaries of Drosophila melanogaster: a putative explanation for the l(3)ecd1 mutation,9014338,10.1016/s0965-1748(96)00059-8,"Studies in vitro revealed that intact ring glands of Drosophila melanogaster convert tritiated cholesterol (C) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25C) via 7-dehydrocholesterol (7dC) and 7-dehydro-25-hydroxycholesterol (7d25C), respectively, to ecdysone (E) and 2-deoxyecdysone (2dE), while both intact and homogenized ovaries synthesize only 2dE from these precursors. Emulsified 7d25C was incorporated directly into ecdysteroids by these tissue preparations at a much greater rate than was 7d25C made in situ from 25C. To probe the basis of the biochemical defect in the ecdysteroid deficient conditional mutant ecdysoneless (ecd1), the differential incorporation into ecdysteroids of C (via 7dC), and particularly of 25C (via 7d25C), was measured relative to that observed after the incubation of 7d25C directly with both wild type and mutant tissues in vitro at 30 degrees C, the restrictive temperature. Both C and 25C were equally 7,8-dehydrogenated in situ to 7dC or 7d25C, respectively, by both wild type and mutant tissues at 30 degrees C. However, the rate of subsequent conversion of either of these delta 5,7-sterol intermediates synthesized in situ to ecdysteroids was reduced an average of 50% in the mutant tissues relative to the wild type. Yet, when emulsified 7d25C was incubated directly with either the wild type or mutant tissues at the restrictive temperature, the amplified rate of conversion of the freely available 7d25C to ecdysteroid by these tissues was identical. These data suggest that the defect in ecd1 tissue-mediated ecdysteroidogenesis does not involve a ""hit"" on any of the enzymes involved in either the 7,8-dehydrogenation of C or 25C or in the subsequent oxidation of 7d25C or 7dC to ecdysteroid. Rather, the mutation appears to affect the expression of a gene governing the translocation of delta 5,7-sterol intermediates from the subcellular compartment where they are synthesized and/or stored to the site of subsequent oxidation to ecdysteroid.",1996,"J T Warren, J S Bachmann, J D Dai, L I Gilbert, J T Warren, J S Bachmann, J D Dai, L I Gilbert"
Genetic and molecular studies of olfaction in Drosophila,8894304,10.1002/9780470514948.ch20,"Drosophila melanogaster, an insect amenable to convenient molecular and genetic manipulation, has a highly sensitive olfactory system. A number of Drosophila olfactory mutants have been isolated and characterized. The smellblind mutant has a defect affecting a voltage-gated Na+ channel. The norpA mutant, defective in a phospholipase C, has a reduced response to odorants in one type of olfactory organ, providing genetic evidence for use of the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate signal transduction pathway in olfaction. Since the norpA gene is also required for phototransduction, this work demonstrates overlap in the molecular genetic basis of vision and olfaction. Interestingly, genetic analysis indicates that some olfactory information flows through a pathway which does not depend on norpA. Some mutants, such as ptg, acj6 and Sco, show odorant specificity, in the sense that some odorant responses are greatly reduced, whereas others are little affected, if at all. Some, but not all, mutations affect both larval and adult olfactory responses. Two tightly-linked Drosophila genes encode homologues of moth pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs). Genetic analysis may help determine whether PBPs facilitate transit of pheromones to or from olfactory receptor neurons. Information from Drosophila could be useful in designing means of controlling mosquitoes. It may also be possible to study olfactory genes, such as those encoding PBPs, from other insects by mutating them, introducing them into Drosophila and analysing their function in vivo.",1996,"D S Hekmat-Scafe, J R Carlson, D S Hekmat-Scafe, J R Carlson"

One strain carried 12 extra copies of the Hsp70 gene at a single insertion site (extra-copy strain) and the other carried remnants of the transgene construct but lacked the extra copies of Hsp70 (excision strain). Hsp70 levels in whole-body lysates of larvae and pupae were measured by ELISA with an Hsp70-specific antibody. In both extra-copy and excision strains, Hsp70 was undetectable prior to heat shock. Hsp70 concentrations were higher in the extra-copy strain than in the excision strain at most time points during and after heat shock. Pretreatment (i.e. exposure to 36 degrees C before heat shock) significantly improved thermotolerance, and this improvement was greater and more rapid in larvae and pupae of the extra-copy strain than in those of the excision strain. The experimental conditions resemble thermal regimes actually experienced by Drosophila in the field.

The determination of sensory mother cells at this stage of development was confirmed by expression of the neuralized gene in a subset of the proliferating histoblasts. Ectopic expression of wg leads to the appearance of ectopic bristles and expanded tergite and sternite, indicating that wg expression is sufficient to promote both bristle formation and tergite/sternite differentiation. wg is expressed in the dividing and spreading histoblast population in a restricted pattern which may determine the spatial arrangement of cuticular elements.",1996,"A D Shirras, J P Couso, A D Shirras, J P Couso"
Immunocytochemical electron microscopic study and Western blot analysis of troponin in striated muscle of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and in several muscle cell types of the earthworm Eisenia foetida,8808389,10.1002/(SICI)1097-0185(199602)244:2<148::AID-AR2>3.0.CO;2-Y,"Background:
      
    

    
      There is little information about troponin in invertebrate muscles, and no previous references to this protein in annelid muscles have been found. The aim of this paper was to study the presence and distribution of troponin in different muscle cell types from the earthworm Eisenia foetida (the muscular body wall, and the inner and outer muscular layer of the pseudoheart). These results were compared with those obtained in the transversely striated muscle of Drosophila melanogaster and in skeletal and smooth muscles of the mouse.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Immunocytochemical electron microscopic study and Western blot analysis using anti-TnT antibodies were employed in this study.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Troponin immunoreaction was detected in the mouse skeletal muscle, the fly flight muscle, and earthworm obliquely striated muscles (body wall musculature and inner muscular layer of the pseudoheart). Immunolabeling for TnT in all these muscle cells appeared in moderate amounts at any point along the sarcomere length, except for the central zone of the A band (H band). This suggests that troponin molecules were located along the thin filaments. The density of immunogold particles was similar in the three muscles, and thus the amount of troponin in each muscle type was proportional to the number and length of actin filaments in each. Troponin was found in neither the mouse smooth muscle nor the outer muscular layer of the earthworm pseudoheart. The latter muscle showed an ultrastructural pattern that was intermediate between obliquely striated and smooth muscle. The estimated molecular weight for TnT in the earthworm was 55 kDa; this is higher than the weight of this protein in the mouse skeletal muscle (40 kDa) but similar to that of the D. melanogaster muscle (52 kDa).
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Troponin is present in both types of striated muscle (transversely striated and obliquely striated) of the earthworm with a distribution that is very similar to that observed in the mammalian striated muscle. As in vertebrates, troponin is absent in the smooth muscle of the earthworm. Discrepancies in the classification of some invertebrate muscles are common in the literature, and the use of distinctive markers, such as troponin, may improve our understanding of the nature and properties of many invertebrate muscles showing an ultrastructural pattern that does not resemble any of the classic muscle types.",1996,"M Royuela, R GarcÃ­a-Anchuelo, M Paz de Miguel, M I Arenas, B Fraile, R Paniagua, M Royuela, R GarcÃ­a-Anchuelo, M Paz de Miguel, M I Arenas, B Fraile, R Paniagua"

In addition to being different in gene number, the cluster of genes in D. virilis differs dramatically in intron-exon structure from the maltase genes in D. melanogaster, the transcriptional orientation of the genes in the cluster also differs between the species. Our findings support a model in which the maltase gene cluster in D. virilis and D. melanogaster evolved independently. Furthermore, while in D. melanogaster the maltase gene cluster lies only 10 kb distant from the larval cuticle gene cluster, the maltase and larval cuticle gene clusters in D. virilis are located very far apart and on a different chromosome than that expected from the known chromosome arm homologies between D. virilis and D. melanogaster.

Autosomal mutations affecting adhesion between wing surfaces in Drosophila melanogaster,9136017,,"Integrins are evolutionarily conserved transmembrane alpha,beta heterodimeric receptors involved in cell-to-matrix and cell-to-cell adhesions. In Drosophila the position-specific (PS) integrins mediate the formation and maintenance of junctions between muscle and epidermis and between the two epidermal wing surfaces.

In Drosophila, somatic clones of mutations in PS integrin genes disrupt adhesion between wing surfaces to produce wing blisters. To identify other genes whose products function in adhesion between wing surfaces, we conducted a screen for autosomal mutations that produce blisters in somatic wing clones. We isolated 76 independent mutations in 25 complementation groups, 15 of which contain more than one allele. Chromosomal sites were determined by deficiency mapping, and genetic interactions with mutations in the beta PS integrin gene myospheroid were investigated. Mutations in four known genes (blistered, Delta, dumpy and mastermind) were isolated.

AN INTERACTION BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE AND GENETIC VARIATION FOR BODY SIZE FOR THE FITNESS OF ADULT FEMALE DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,28565476,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb03964.x,"- Drosophila and other ectotherms show geographic genetic variation in body size, with larger individuals at higher latitudes and altitudes. Temperature is implicated as an important selective agent because long-term laboratory culture of Drosophila leads to the evolution of larger body size at lower temperatures. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that, in Drosophila melanogaster, larger size is favored at lower temperatures in part because of selection on adult females. We used replicated lines of D. melanogaster artificially selected for increased and decreased wing area with constant cell area. The resulting size differences between the selected lines were due solely to differences in cell number, and thereby were similar to the cellular basis of clinal variation in body size in nature. We examined life-history traits of adult females at 18 and 25Â°C. Rearing for two generations at the two temperatures did not affect the extent of the size differences between lines from the different selection regimes. There was a strong interaction between temperature and size selection for both survival and lifetime reproductive success, with larger females living significantly longer and producing more offspring over their lifetime only when reared and tested in the colder environment. There was also an increase in average daily progeny production in large-line females relative to the control and small lines again, only in the colder environment. Thus, the females from the large selection lines were relatively fitter at the colder temperature. At both experimental temperatures, especially the lower one, the small- line females rescheduled their progeny production to later ages. Larger body size may have evolved at higher latitudes and altitudes because of the advantages to the adult female of being larger at lower temperatures.",1997,"Jennie McCabe, Linda Partridge, Jennie McCabe, Linda Partridge"
[The effect of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine on the lifespan and behavior of Drosophila melanogaster],9518304,,"In this study, we have examined the effect of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporated into DNA of Drosophila nerve cells after incubation of larvae in the analog-containing medium on the duration of lifespan and behavior (photoactivity) of adult flies. 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporated into DNA decreases the lifespan of adult animals. In contrast to the control, the curves describing the probability of death become bimodal at higher doses of the analog (above 35 (g/ml). As the dose of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine decreases, photoactivity of the flies diminishes, and the distribution into fractions with different activity becomes broader. The data obtained provide evidence that the modification of DNA with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine drastically changes the expression of tissue-specific genes in nerve ganglia of Drosophila and at the same time diminishes the duration of insects lifespan. These observations suggest that genome of the nerve cells appears to be a probable initial substrate of Drosophila aging.",1997,"A I Potapenko, E G Rudakovskaia, N A Kozhevnikova, I D Putrina, A P Akif'ev, A I Potapenko, E G Rudakovskaia, N A Kozhevnikova, I D Putrina, A P Akif'ev"
The lack of mutational variance for fluctuating and directional asymmetry in Drosophila melanogaster,9061970,10.1098/rspb.1997.0033,"Starting from a completely homozygous population of Drosophila melanogaster, lines were derived and independently maintained by a single brother-sister mating in each generation. Two bilateral traits--sternopleural bristle number and wing length--were individually scored on the right-(R) and left-hand (L) sides. Directional (DA) and fluctuating (FA) asymmetries were represented by the signed (R-L) and unsigned magnitude of R-L difference, respectively. Mutational variances (the mutational rate of input of genetic variation) and heritabilities (the mutational variance scaled by the environmental variance) of R, L, (R-L) and magnitude of R-L were calculated from the between-line divergence after a number of generations of mutation accumulation (bristle number: 171 lines, 122 generations; wing length: 148 lines, 170 generations). Mutational heritabilities of R and L were all significant, ranging from 0.73 x 10(-3)-2.10 x 10(-3). Those of (R-L) and magnitude of R-L were two orders of magnitude smaller and nonsignificant, ranging from -1.95 x 10(-5)-5.49 x 10(-5). These results imply that mutations affecting the DA or FA of bristle number and wing length have not been fixed in the lines or alternatively, that their effects were too small to be detected. In the population under study, the data strongly suggest that FA reflects only developmental noise due to non-genetic processes.",1997,"J L Monedero, D ChavarrÃ­as, C LÃ³pez-Fanjul, J L Monedero, D ChavarrÃ­as, C LÃ³pez-Fanjul"
Partial characterization of a fatty acid desaturase gene in Drosophila melanogaster,9501419,10.1016/s0965-1748(97)00077-5,"The open reading frame of a gene encoding a protein homologous to vertebrate fatty acid desaturases has been characterized in Drosophila melanogaster. This is the first description of a desaturase sequence in insects. Two cDNAs were cloned: the combined 1.5 kb nucleotide sequences indicate that the gene encodes a polypeptide of 383 amino acid residues with a high sequence similarity to the well defined delta 9 desaturases from rat and yeast and desaturases from carp and tick. The Drosophila protein contains two histidine cluster motifs (HXXHH) and two hydrophobic regions which are conserved among all desaturases, whereas the amino and carboxy ends look more variable. The desaturase gene seems to be expressed in adults at a low level, with a greater prevalence in females than in males. Two genomic sequences have been amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and have a very similar open reading frame but a different organization; one with three introns and the other without introns. Both seem to correspond to two distinct genes and have been named ""desat locus"". They are localized to a single locus, 87C, on the right arm of the third chromosome.

Reduced response amplitudes were recorded for all odorants tested, and the physiological defect was shown to map to the lz locus. The structure of the maxillary palp sensilla is described by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at high magnification, initially in the wild-type. A linear arrangement of pores, connected by furrows, was found in one class of sensilla, the basiconic sensilla. In the lz3 mutant, morphological alterations in the basiconic sensilla and duplications of sensilla are documented by SEM.

However, enzymatic activities in their activated states were much lower than in the wild type, whereas the existence of prophenoloxidase proteins was demonstrated.

We have isolated the cDNA for Drosophila melanogaster AdoHcyase by screening a Drosophila ovarian expression library. The 1584-nucleotide cDNA encodes a protein of 431 amino acids, showing 80.5% identity with human AdoHcyase. Southern analysis of genomic DNA and in situ hybridization to salivary gland chromosomes indicate that a single gene encodes the D. melanogaster AdoHcyase. The gene resides in region 13C1-2 on the X chromosome. Transcript analysis shows a single AdoHcyase mRNA present in unfertilized eggs, and, at a more or less constant level of expression, in all developmental stages tested, ranging from early embryos to adults. The deduced amino acid sequence was compared to a putative AdoHcyase-like protein encoded by a cDNA mapping to the 89E region of the second chromosome and showing much lower similarity to known AdoHcyases.

Evolution of foraging behavior in Drosophila by density-dependent selection,9207098,10.1073/pnas.94.14.7373,"One of the rare examples of a single major gene underlying a naturally occurring behavioral polymorphism is the foraging locus of Drosophila melanogaster. Larvae with the rover allele, forR, have significantly longer foraging path lengths on a yeast paste than do those homozygous for the sitter allele, fors. These variants do not differ in general activity in the absence of food. The evolutionary significance of this polymorphism is not as yet understood. Here we examine the effect of high and low animal rearing densities on the larval foraging path-length phenotype and show that density-dependent natural selection produces changes in this trait. In three unrelated base populations the long path (rover) phenotype was selected for under high-density rearing conditions, whereas the short path (sitter) phenotype was selected for under low-density conditions. Genetic crosses suggested that these changes resulted from alterations in the frequency of the fors allele in the low-density-selected lines. Further experiments showed that density-dependent selection during the larval stage rather than the adult stage of development was sufficient to explain these results. Density-dependent mechanisms may be sufficient to maintain variation in rover and sitter behavior in laboratory populations.",1997,"M B Sokolowski, H S Pereira, K Hughes, M B Sokolowski, H S Pereira, K Hughes"
The developmental genetics of hybrid inviability: a mitotic defect in Drosophila hybrids,9093855,,"We report studies of the developmental basis of hybrid inviability in the Drosophila melanogaster complex. The pathology of these hybrids closely resembles that of mitotic mutants in D. melanogaster. We use mosaic and cytological analyses to show that hybrid male inviability is associated with, and probably caused by, a defect in mitotic cell division. In the mosaic study, we find that male clones produced in otherwise female hybrids are not cell lethal but are very small, probably reflecting defects in mitotic proliferation. Cytological inspection of larval neuroblasts reveals a profound mitotic defect in hybrids: chromosomes show a near-complete failure to condense even after 2 hr of incubation in colchicine. Both the defect in clonal proliferation and in chromatin condensation are rescued by mutations known to rescue normally inviable hybrid males. We present a simple model in which hybrid inviability is partly or entirely caused by a mitotic defect; this defect is, in turn, caused by an interaction between the Hybrid male rescue (Hmr) locus of D. melanogaster and autosomal gene(s) from D. melanogaster's sister species.",1997,"H A Orr, L D Madden, J A Coyne, R Goodwin, R S Hawley"
Behavioral and Electrophysiologic Responses of Drosophila melanogaster to Prolonged Periods of Anoxia,12769903,10.1016/s0022-1910(96)00084-4,"Sensitivity to anoxia varies tremendously among phyla and species. Most mammals are exquisitely sensitive to low concentrations of inspired oxygen, while some fish, turtles and crustacea are very resistant. To determine the basis of anoxia tolerance, it would be useful to utilize a model system which can yield mechanistic answers. We studied the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to determine its anoxia resistance since this organism has been previously studied using a variety of approaches and has proven to be very useful in a number of areas of biology. Flies were exposed to anoxia for periods of 5-240 min, and, after 1-2 min in anoxia, Drosophila lost coordination, fell down, and became motionless. However, they tolerated a complete nitrogen atmosphere for up to 4 h following which they recovered. In addition, a nonlinear relation existed between time spent in anoxia and time to recovery. Extracellular recordings from flight muscles in response to giant fiber stimulation revealed complete recovery of muscle-evoked response, a response that was totally absent during anoxia. Mean O(2) consumption per gram of tissue was substantially reduced in low O(2) concentrations (20% of control). We conclude from these studies that: (1) Drosophila melanogaster is very resistant to anoxia and can be useful in the study of mechanisms of anoxia tolerance; and (2) the profound decline in metabolic rate during periods of low environmental O(2) levels contributes to the survival of Drosophila.

"Natural selection and the frequency distributions of ""silent"" DNA polymorphism in Drosophila",9136019,,"In Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Drosophila melanogaster, codon bias may be maintained by a balance among mutation pressure, genetic drift, and natural selection favoring translationally superior codons. Under such an evolutionary model, silent mutations fall into two fitness categories: preferred mutations that increase codon bias and unpreferred changes in the opposite direction. This prediction can be tested by comparing the frequency spectra of synonymous changes segregating within populations; natural selection will elevate the frequencies of advantageous mutations relative to that of deleterious changes. The frequency distributions of preferred and unpreferred mutations differ in the predicted direction among 99 alleles of two D. pseudoobscura genes and five alleles of eight D. simulans genes. This result confirms the existence of fitness classes of silent mutations. Maximum likelihood estimates suggest that selection intensity at silent sites is, on average, very weak in both D. pseudoobscura and D. simulans (magnitude of NS approximately 1). Inference of evolutionary processes from within-species sequence variation is often hindered by the assumption of a stationary frequency distribution. This assumption can be avoided when identifying the action of selection and tested when estimating selection intensity.",1997,"H Akashi, S W Schaeffer, H Akashi, S W Schaeffer"

Subsequently, the cDNA for this gene was sequenced, and the identified open reading frame was named ypsilon schachtel (yps). The expression pattern of yps indicates that this gene is expressed throughout development with the highest level of expression found in adult flies. In situ hybridization shows that the yps mRNA is maternally loaded into the egg cytoplasm. In addition, there appears to be expression of yps mRNA in mesodermal tissue during embryogenesis. YPS, while containing a conserved CSD, is novel in that it completely lacks the alternating acidic and basic regions found in the C-terminus of the other vertebrate eukaryotic Y-box proteins. The CSD of yps was purified and gel-shift analysis showed that this domain can interact with RNA.

Treatment with BUDR distorted the form of survival curves and caused death of insects immediately after exclusion.

Molecular population genetics of Drosophila immune system genes,9335607,,"A striking aspect of many vertebrate immune system is the exceptionally high level of polymorphism they harbor. A convincing case can be made that this polymorphism is driven by the diversity of pathogens that face selective pressures to evade attack by the host immune system. Different organisms accomplish a defense against diverse pathogens through mechanisms that differ widely in their requirements for specific recognition. It has recently been shown that innate defense mechanisms, which use proteins with broad-spectrum bactericidal properties, are common to both primitive and advanced organisms. In this study we characterize DNA sequence variation in six pathogen defense genes of Drosophila melanogaster and D. mauritiana, including Andropin; cecropin genes CecA1, CecA2, CecB, and CecC; and Diptericin. The necessity for protection against diverse pathogens, which themselves may evolve resistance to insect defenses, motivates a population-level analysis. Estimates of variation levels show that the genes are not exceptionally polymorphic, but Andropin and Diptericin have patterns of variation that differ significantly from neutrality.

Reproduction had a much more marked effect on fertility than survival: males with a history of reproduction showed complete sterility at a time when upwards of 80% of their cohort were still alive. Analyses of survival rates alone gave a misleading measure of the impact of ageing. Sterility appeared to be attributable mainly to a reduction in sperm count. Early reproduction caused permanent, irreversible damage to both survival and fecundity, with risk playing an apparently minor role. Individual differences in frailty appeared to be of little consequence for the interpretation of these reversal experiments, although its possible occurrence made definite detection of risk difficult.",1997,"L Partridge, N Prowse, L Partridge, N Prowse"

Although the punt gene was originally identified based on its requirement for embryonic dorsal closure, we have documented multiple periods of punt activity throughout the Drosophila life cycle. We demonstrate that potentially related embryonic punt phenotypes, defects in dorsoventral patterning and dorsal closure, correspond to distinct maternal and zygotic requirements for punt. In addition, we document postembryonic requirements for punt activity. The tight correspondence between both embryonic and postembryonic loss-of-function punt and dpp phenotypes implicates a role for Punt in mediating virtually all Dpp signaling events in Drosophila. Finally, our comparison of punt homoallelic and heteroallelic phenotypes provides direct evidence for interallelic complementation.

The rate of ecdysteroid synthesis by the ovaries, but not JH production, increased within 12h of a temperature upshift to 25 degrees C from a basal level of 20+/-1pg/10 pair of ovaries/5h to a sustained level of 150+/-20pg/10 pair/5h. Vitellogenic oocytes were noted in all females within 12h of this temperature upshift. Diapause was also terminated by the injection of 1&mgr;g of 20-hydroxyecdysone into the abdomens of diapausing females as determined by an increase in ovary size, and the appearance of vitellogenic oocytes as compared to controls. These results are consistent with a revised model for the regulation of yolk protein uptake by ovaries in which ecdysteroids, and not JHs, play the prominent role.",1998,"L I. Gilbert, R B.

Stereotypic behavioral responses to free-base cocaine and the development of behavioral sensitization in Drosophila,9427649,10.1016/s0960-9822(98)70041-7,"Cocaine abuse is a large social and economic problem that has received much public and scientific attention in recent years. Rodent and primate models have been used to study the behavioral and neurological effects of cocaine. Repeated intermittent doses of cocaine lead to progressive increases in both locomotor activity and stereotyped behaviors known as 'reverse tolerance' or behavioral sensitization, which may model the behavioral and neurochemical processes occurring in cocaine-addicted humans [1]. The biological basis of sensitization is poorly understood. We report that free-base cocaine administered in volatile form to the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster induces multiple reflexive motor responses that resemble cocaine-induced behaviors in rodents. These behaviors are both dose dependent and sexually dimorphic. Furthermore, Drosophila develops a behavioral sensitization to intermittent doses of cocaine. These results suggest that the pathways leading to cocaine-induced responses and sensitization are evolutionarily conserved between Drosophila and higher vertebrates, and that this genetically tractable animal can be used as a new model system to help determine the biological mechanisms underlying these processes.",1998,"C McClung, J Hirsh, C McClung, J Hirsh"
Understanding the genetic basis of morphological evolution: the role of homeotic genes in the diversification of the arthropod bauplan,9654031,,"Due to the segmental organization of their body plans, arthropods can be considered the paradigmatic modular organisms. In the past two decades, genetic studies of the homeotic (Hox) genes in Drosophila melanogaster have provided initial insight into the molecular mechanisms that govern the establishment of segmental identity. In this review, we will address the question of the possible role of four Hox genes: labial (lab), proboscipedia (pb), Deformed (Dfd), and Sex combs reduced (Scr) in the morphological evolution of arthropods, particularly with respect to the evolution of the head and head structures in insects. Overall, these preliminary studies illustrate the role that some of the Hox genes expressed in the insect head have played in the morphological evolution of hexapods and likely arthropods in general.",1998,"A Popadi?, A Abzhanov, D Rusch, T C Kaufman, A Popadi?, A Abzhanov, D Rusch, T C Kaufman"
Age dependence of the copia transposition rate is positively associated with copia transcript abundance in a Drosophila melanogaster isogenic line,9671033,10.1007/s004380050778,"In males of an inbred Drosophila melanogaster line (2b), a significant age dependence of the transposition rate of the retrotransposon copia was noted. Among males of seven different age groups, the lowest transposition rate was detected in 12- to 15-day-old males, and the highest transposition rates were observed in 1- to 3- and in 24- to 27-day-old males: rates of 0.36 +/- 0.07, 1.09 +/- 0.20 and 117 +/- 0.27 transpositions per generation per gamete, respectively, were measured. This type of age dependence of the transposition rate indicates that copia transpositions do not occur in stem cells. Clusters of copia transpositions were detected, which confirms that copia transpositions occur at premeiotic stages of spermatogenesis. A positive association between copia transposition rate and copia transcript abundance in the testes was demonstrated for 1- to 3-, 12- to 15- and 24- to 27-day-old males, as well as for 1- to 3-day-old males of two closely related sublines of the 2b line that differed in copia transposition rate. Thus, copia transposition rate in males is apparently regulated at the level of copia RNA abundance in testes. The age dependence of the copia transposition rate and copia transcript abundance within the 2b line demonstrates that the physiological state of the host may affect expression and transposition of the retroelement.",1998,"D A Filatov, T V Morozova, E G Pasyukova, D A Filatov, T V Morozova, E G Pasyukova"

HERITABLE VARIATION FOR FECUNDITY IN FIELD-COLLECTED DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER AND THEIR OFFSPRING REARED UNDER DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURES,28568166,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1998.tb05146.x,"Heritable variation for fitness components is normally measured under favorable laboratory conditions, but organisms in the field experience variable conditions that are often stressful and may affect the expression of heritable variation. We examined heritable variation for early fecundity in three samples of Drosophila melanogaster from the field. Flies were obtained from a rotting fruit pile in summer, autumn, and spring, and progeny were reared under laboratory conditions. Field parents were tested for fecundity at 14Â°C or 28Â°C depending on ambient temperatures. Wing/thorax length ratios measured on flies from the spring collection suggested that flies had developed at around 20Â°C. Progeny were reared and tested at 14Â°C, 25Â°C, and 28Â°C. In the summer collection, parent-offspring regression coefficients were high and significant, compared to nonsignificant values obtained in two of three autumn comparisons. In the spring collection, parent-offspring regressions were negative regardless of testing temperature, suggesting that field females with a high fecundity produced offspring with low scores. Comparisons of F1 and F2 laboratory generations indicated intermediate heritabilities for fecundity in the laboratory. The lower bound heritability estimate for fecundity in field individuals was 37% in summer and 59% in autumn. Estimates of field heritability and evolvability for wing length measured in the spring collection were lower than in the laboratory. The results indicate that heritabilities and additive genetic variances for fecundity can be high in field-reared flies, but that results may vary between field collections.",1998,"Carla M SgrÃ², Ary A Hoffmann, Carla M SgrÃ², Ary A Hoffmann"
Evolutionary history and mechanism of the Drosophila cecropin gene family,9553148,10.1007/s002510050379,"Upon bacterial infection, insects secrete a set of synthesized antibacterial proteins into the hemolymph and initiate synergistic destruction of invaders. Cecropin is one such antibacterial protein which is also found in vertebrates. To study the evolutionary history and mechanism of the Cecropin gene family, we determined DNA sequences of one isogenic In(3R)C and six isofemale lines of Drosophila melanogaster as well as one line of D. simulans and of D. yakuba. The phylogenetic analysis of these sequences together with those published for D. virilis and Sarcophaga peregrina reveals frequent gene re-organization. It was also found that silent nucleotide differences within D. melanogaster are quite heterogeneous across the gene region of approximately 3 kilobases and the extent of polymorphism is unusually usually high. These data suggest that the Cecropin gene region of D. melanogaster underwent intragenic recombination as well as introgression from a closely related sibling species, D. simulans.",1998,"A Date, Y Satta, N Takahata, S I Chigusa"
Isolation and characterization of the Drosophila melanogaster cDNA encoding the sepiapterin reductase,9838142,10.1016/s0167-4781(98)00222-x,"We have isolated and characterized the cDNA encoding Drosophila melanogaster sepiapterin reductase (SR). The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence was 29% identical to those of mammalian SRs. The active site residues proposed from the three-dimensional structure of mouse SR are well conserved in Drosophila SR. The protein-coding region of the cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli as a histidine fusion protein, and the resulting recombinant protein proved to have SR activity. The SR activity of the recombinant protein was inhibited by two indoleamines, N-acetyl serotonin and melatonin. Southern analysis suggests that the Drosophila SR gene is encoded by a single copy gene. RNA blot analysis revealed that the gene expresses 1.5 kb mRNA in both adult heads and bodies.",1998,"C Seong, Y A Kim, H J Chung, D Park, J Yim, K Baek, Y S Park, K Han, J Yoon, C Seong, Y A Kim, H J Chung, D Park, J Yim, K Baek, Y S Park, K Han, J Yoon"
Transgenic Drosophila expressing human amyloid precursor protein show gamma-secretase activity and a blistered-wing phenotype,9811864,10.1073/pnas.95.23.13703,"The importance of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) became apparent through the identification of distinct mutations in the APP gene, causing early onset familial AD with the accumulation of a 4-kDa peptide fragment (betaA4) in amyloid plaques and vascular deposits. However, the physiological role of APP is still unclear. In this work, Drosophila melanogaster is used as a model system to analyze the function of APP by expressing wild-type and various mutant forms of human APP in fly tissue culture cells as well as in transgenic fly lines. After expression of full-length APP forms, secretion of APP but not of betaA4 was observed in both systems. By using SPA4CT, a short APP form in which the signal peptide was fused directly to the betaA4 region, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic tail, we observed betaA4 release in flies and fly-tissue culture cells. Consequently, we showed a gamma-secretase activity in flies. Interestingly, transgenic flies expressing full-length forms of APP have a blistered-wing phenotype. As the wing is composed of interacting dorsal and ventral epithelial cell layers, this phenotype suggests that human APP expression interferes with cell adhesion/signaling pathways in Drosophila, independently of betaA4 generation.",1998,"A Fossgreen, B BrÃ¼ckner, C Czech, C L Masters, K Beyreuther, R Paro, A Fossgreen, B BrÃ¼ckner, C Czech, C L Masters, K Beyreuther, R Paro"

They not only regulate mammalian homeotic genes by analogy with their Drosophila counterparts, but also have some influence on the growth and differentiation of B lymphocytes.

Thus we would like to propose that mammalian PcG genes can be categorized as a new type of immediate early gene.",1998,"M Hasegawa, O Tetsu, R Kanno, H Inoue, H Ishihara, M Kamiyasu, M Taniguchi, M Kanno, M Hasegawa, O Tetsu, R Kanno, H Inoue, H Ishihara, M Kamiyasu, M Taniguchi, M Kanno"
Hydrogen peroxide production in immune-reactive Drosophila melanogaster,9920305,,"Upon infection with the wasp parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi, the blood cells or hemocytes of Drosophila melanogaster larvae become activated and manifest a type of communal phagocytosis wherein eggs of the parasitoid are enveloped by multicellular, melanotic capsules. Hemocytes engaged in this collaborative response generate reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI). These molecules, together with melanogenic intermediates, are believed to destroy intrahemocoelic parasites. Cellular uptake of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF-DA) and the oxidation of its deacetylated form (DCF) to yield the fluorescent product dichlorofluorescein (DC) was used as an intracellular probe for oxidant generation. The selective uptake of the fluorescent probe only by activated plasmatocytes from immune-reactive larvae identified these hemocytes as the source of ROI. Inhibition of DCF oxidation by catalase established hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as 1 of the principal oxidants generated during melanotic encapsulation. A sensitive spectrometric assay for assessing iron oxidation and complex formation with xylenol orange (FOX assay) also was used to document in vitro-enhanced H2O2-mediated oxidations by hemolymph from immune-competent larvae. Cumulative evidence now establishes both superoxide anion (O2-*) and its dismutation product H2O2 in the cellular encapsulation response of D. melanogaster.",1998,"A J Nappi, E Vass, A J Nappi, E Vass"
DISENTANGLING THE EFFECTS OF MATING PROPENSITY AND MATING CHOICE IN DROSOPHILA,28568139,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1998.tb05145.x,"Incipient sexual isolation between genotypes, lines, or populations of the same species is commonly measured in Drosophila by choice tests. Results of these tests are known to be influenced, in an undetermined manner, by the mating propensity of competitors and by discriminatory factors during courtship. We have approached the problem by measuring male and female propensities in separate, independent tests, and by examining whether these estimates could explain the results of the choice tests. First, male and female choice tests were used to measure sexual isolation between populations of Drosophila melanogaster and between populations of D. simulans. Significant deviations from random mating occurred in 31 out of 48 tests, in agreement with the propensity values of the tested genotypes. We conclude that mating propensity instead of discrimination is directly involved in the estimation of sexual isolation in our populations, and advise against the application of male and female choice tests to assess intraspecific isolation without a proper knowledge of the mating propensities of competing individuals. Second, multiple choice tests were used to assess isolation between D. melanogaster populations. In examining the dynamics of matings throughout the test, we show that if competing individuals differ in mating propensities and tests are long enough to allow most matings to happen, a spurious sexual isolation can appear. We recommend that multiple choice tests be terminated once 50 percent of matings had been observed.",1998,"Pelayo Casares, Maria C Carracedo, Beatriz Del Rio, Rafael Pineiro, Lucia Garcia-Florez, Ana R Barros, Pelayo Casares, Maria C Carracedo, Beatriz Del Rio, Rafael Pineiro, Lucia Garcia-Florez, Ana R Barros"
Mutation and evolution of microsatellites in Drosophila melanogaster,9720288,,"Levels of nucleotide polymorphism in the Drosophila melanogaster genome are correlated with rates of recombination. This relationship may be due to hitchhiking of advantageous mutations (selective sweeps) or to continual removal of deleterious mutations from the genome (background selection). One test of the relative contributions of selective sweeps and background selection to the observed levels of variation in the genome of D. melanogaster is to compare levels of nucleotide variability (with a mutation rate on the order of 10(-9) per nucleotide per generation) with more rapidly evolving DNA loci such as microsatellites. This test depends critically on details of the mutational process of microsatellites. In this paper, we summarize our studies of microsatellite characteristics and mutation rates in D. melanogaster. We find that D. melanogaster microsatellites are short and have a mutation rate (6.5 x 10(-6) per locus per generation) several orders of magnitude lower than mammals studied to date. We further show that genetic variation at 18 dinucleotide repeat microsatellites in a population of D. melanogaster from Maryland is correlated with regional rates of recombination. These and other microsatellite data suggest that both background selection and selective sweeps may contribute to the correlation between DNA sequence variation and recombination in Drosophila.",1998,"M D Schug, C M Hutter, M A Noor, C F Aquadro"
Functional analysis of conserved domains in the phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator. Molecular cloning of the homologues from Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae,9737869,10.1021/bi980496l,"Phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator (PTPA), a 37 kDa cytosolic protein that specifically activates the phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activity of the dimeric form of PP2A, was cloned from Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Sequence alignment of PTPA from yeast to human revealed highly conserved regions including the type B fragment of the putative PTPA ATP binding site. We generated PTPA deletion mutants of these conserved regions as well as point mutations within regions that were suggested to be functionally important. The recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli and subsequently purified. Activity measurements, linked with immunological detection, revealed that most of the well-conserved regions are essential for PTPA activity. However, neither the type A fragment of the putative ATP binding site nor the cysteine-rich region, present in all but the Drosophila and yeast homologues, appeared to be essential for PTPA activity. Moreover, we observed that PTPA truncated at glycine266 behaves as a dominant negative mutant since it is inhibitory to the wild-type PTPA.",1998,"C Van Hoof, V Janssens, A Dinishiotu, W Merlevede, J Goris, C Van Hoof, V Janssens, A Dinishiotu, W Merlevede, J Goris"
The paternal effect gene ms(3)sneaky is required for sperm activation and the initiation of embryogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,9630751,10.1006/dbio.1997.8852,"Although a large number of maternal factors are known to be essential for fertilization or the earliest stages of embryogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, the role of paternally supplied products is not clearly understood. Paternal effect mutations provide a means to identify factors specifically required by the sperm after its entry into the egg. Here we describe the third strict paternal effect gene to be identified in Drosophila ms(3)sneaky(snky), which defines the earliest developmental arrest phenotype so far described. Characterization of two independently isolated snky mutations showed that they affected male fertility, but not viability or female fertility. Cytological analyses showed that spermatogenesis proceeded normally in snky males. However, the snky defect was evident after sperm entry into the egg; snky sperm did not undergo nuclear decondensation, form a functional male pronucleus, or initiate mitotic divisions in the egg. Immunolocalization of tubulin and Drosophila Centrosomin, a known centrosomal component, showed that snky-inseminated eggs failed to reconstitute a microtubule-organizing center. In addition, snky sperm chromatin retained the histochemical properties of mature sperm chromatin for several hours after sperm entry, showed reduced staining with membrane-impermeant nuclear dyes, and failed to replicate. We conclude that the snky+ product is required for the initial response of the sperm to cytoplasmic cues in the egg and for the subsequent initiation of embryogenesis in Drosophila. We suggest that all of the snky defects can be explained by the failure of the sperm plasma membrane to break down after entry into the egg.",1998,"K R Fitch, B T Wakimoto, K R Fitch, B T Wakimoto"
Genotoxic activity of four inhibitors of DNA topoisomerases in larval cells of Drosophila melanogaster as measured in the wing spot assay,9639703,10.1016/s1383-5718(98)00031-x,"Four inhibitors of DNA topoisomerases namely nalidixic acid, camptothecin, m-amsacrine and etoposide, have been evaluated for genotoxic effects in the wing spot test of Drosophila melanogaster. This assay assesses somatic recombination and mutational events. We studied nalidixic acid as an inhibitor of bacterial DNA gyrase, camptothecin as a topoisomerase I inhibitor, as well as m-amsacrine and etoposide as topoisomerse II inhibitors. The genotoxic effects were determined from the appearance of wing spots in flies trans-heterozygous for the recessive markers multiple wing hairs (mwh) and flare, as well as in flies heterozygous for mwh and the multiply inverted TM3 balancer chromosome. From our results it appears that whilst nalidixic acid and m-amsacrine were compounds that did not increase the incidence of mutant clones, camptothecin and etoposide proved to be significantly genotoxic in this test, being camptothecin more effective than etoposide. A significant proportion of the total spot induction was due to mitotic recombination, confirming previously reported data. On the other hand, the cotreatments of each topoisomerase inhibitor with the alkylating agent ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) indicate that, while nalidixic acid, m-amsacrine and etoposide show a tendency to an antagonistic interaction, camptothecin shows an additive effect, suggesting mechanistic differences between the activity of the four inhibitors of DNA topoisomerases studied.",1998,"C Torres, A Creus, R Marcos, C Torres, A Creus, R Marcos"
Patterns of base composition within the genes of Drosophila melanogaster,9545464,10.1007/pl00006334,"Base composition is not uniform across the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Earlier analyses have suggested that there is variation in composition in D. melanogaster on both a large scale and a much smaller, within-gene, scale. Here we present analyses on 117 genes which have reliable intron/exon boundaries and no known alternative splicing. We detect significant heterogeneity in G+C content among intron segments from the same gene, as well as a significant positive correlation between the intron and the third codon position G+C content within genes. Both of these observations appear to be due, in part, to an overall decline in intron and third codon position G+C content along Drosophila genes with introns. However, there is also evidence of an increase in third codon position G+C content at the start of genes; this is particularly evident in genes without introns. This is consistent with selection acting against preferred codons at the start of genes.",1998,"R M Kliman, A Eyre-Walker, R M Kliman, A Eyre-Walker"
DNA supercoiling factor localizes to puffs on polytene chromosomes in Drosophila melanogaster,9774687,10.1128/mcb.18.11.6737,"DNA supercoiling factor (SCF) was first identified in silkworm as a protein that generates negative supercoils in DNA in conjunction with eukaryotic topoisomerase II. To analyze the in vivo role of the factor, we cloned a cDNA encoding Drosophila melanogaster SCF. Northern analysis revealed 1.6- and 1.8-kb mRNAs throughout development. The longer mRNA contains an open reading frame that shares homology with mouse reticulocalbin whereas the shorter one encodes a truncated version lacking the N-terminal signal peptide-like sequence. An antibody against SCF detected a 45-kDa protein in the cytoplasmic fraction and a 30-kDa protein in the nuclear fraction of embryonic extracts. Immunoprecipitation suggests that the 30-kDa protein interacts with topoisomerase II in the nucleus, and hence that it is a functional form of SCF. Immunostaining of blastoderm embryos showed that SCF is present in nuclei during interphase but is excluded from mitotic chromosomes. In larvae, the antibody stained the nuclei of several tissues including a posterior part of the salivary gland. This latter staining was associated with natural or ecdysteroid-induced puffs on polytene chromosomes. Upon heat treatment of larvae, the staining on the endogenous puffs disappeared, and strong staining appeared on heat shock puffs. These results implicate SCF in gene expression.",1998,"M Kobayashi, N Aita, S Hayashi, K Okada, T Ohta, S Hirose, M Kobayashi, N Aita, S Hayashi, K Okada, T Ohta, S Hirose"
Expression of the GPDH-4 isozyme of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in three Drosophila species,9839437,10.1038/sj.hdy.6883890,"A fourth recently discovered isozyme of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH-4) in Drosophila melanogaster is shown to be a translational product of the Gpdh transcript which contains exons 1 through 7. This transcript was also found in two other Drosophila species, D. busckii and D. virilis. In contrast to D. melanogaster and D. busckii, the Gpdh transcript containing exons 1-6 is absent in D. virilis adults. The reason for this difference between D. virilis and the two other species is intriguing but remains elusive.

Homologous chromosome pairing in Drosophila melanogaster proceeds through multiple independent initiations,9531544,10.1083/jcb.141.1.5,"The dynamics by which homologous chromosomes pair is currently unknown. Here, we use fluorescence in situ hybridization in combination with three-dimensional optical microscopy to show that homologous pairing of the somatic chromosome arm 2L in Drosophila occurs by independent initiation of pairing at discrete loci rather than by a processive zippering of sites along the length of chromosome. By evaluating the pairing frequencies of 11 loci on chromosome arm 2L over several timepoints during Drosophila embryonic development, we show that all 11 loci are paired very early in Drosophila development, within 13 h after egg deposition. To elucidate whether such pairing occurs by directed or undirected motion, we analyzed the pairing kinetics of histone loci during nuclear cycle 14. By measuring changes of nuclear length and correlating these changes with progression of time during cycle 14, we were able to express the pairing frequency and distance between homologous loci as a function of time. Comparing the experimentally determined dynamics of pairing to simulations based on previously proposed models of pairing motion, we show that the observed pairing kinetics are most consistent with a constrained random walk model and not consistent with a directed motion model. Thus, we conclude that simple random contacts through diffusion could suffice to allow pairing of homologous sites.",1998,"J C Fung, W F Marshall, A Dernburg, D A Agard, J W Sedat, J C Fung, W F Marshall, A Dernburg, D A Agard, J W Sedat"
