"A program for annotating and predicting the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms, SnpEff: SNPs in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster strain w1118; iso-2; iso-3",22728672,10.4161/fly.19695,"We describe a new computer program, SnpEff, for rapidly categorizing the effects of variants in genome sequences. Once a genome is sequenced, SnpEff annotates variants based on their genomic locations and predicts coding effects. Annotated genomic locations include intronic, untranslated region, upstream, downstream, splice site, or intergenic regions. Coding effects such as synonymous or non-synonymous amino acid replacement, start codon gains or losses, stop codon gains or losses, or frame shifts can be predicted. Here the use of SnpEff is illustrated by annotating ~356,660 candidate SNPs in ~117 Mb unique sequences, representing a substitution rate of ~1/305 nucleotides, between the Drosophila melanogaster w(1118); iso-2; iso-3 strain and the reference y(1); cn(1) bw(1) sp(1) strain. We show that ~15,842 SNPs are synonymous and ~4,467 SNPs are non-synonymous (N/S ~0.28). The remaining SNPs are in other categories, such as stop codon gains (38 SNPs), stop codon losses (8 SNPs), and start codon gains (297 SNPs) in the 5'UTR. We found, as expected, that the SNP frequency is proportional to the recombination frequency (i.e., highest in the middle of chromosome arms). We also found that start-gain or stop-lost SNPs in Drosophila melanogaster often result in additions of N-terminal or C-terminal amino acids that are conserved in other Drosophila species. It appears that the 5' and 3' UTRs are reservoirs for genetic variations that changes the termini of proteins during evolution of the Drosophila genus. As genome sequencing is becoming inexpensive and routine, SnpEff enables rapid analyses of whole-genome sequencing data to be performed by an individual laboratory.",2012,"Pablo Cingolani, Adrian Platts, Le Lily Wang, Melissa Coon, Tung Nguyen, Luan Wang, Susan J Land, Xiangyi Lu, Douglas M Ruden, Pablo Cingolani, Adrian Platts, Le Lily Wang, Melissa Coon, Tung Nguyen, Luan Wang, Susan J Land, Xiangyi Lu, Douglas M Ruden"
Functional relevance of the newly evolved sperm dynein intermediate chain multigene family in Drosophila melanogaster males,23181161,10.4161/cib.21136,"In many animal species, traits associated with male fitness evolve rapidly. Intersexual conflict and male-male competition have been suggested to drive this rapid evolution. These fast evolutionary dynamics result in elevated rates of amino acid replacement and modification of gene expression attributes. Gene acquisition is another mechanism that might contribute to fitness differences among males. However, empirical evidence of fitness effects associated with newly evolved genes is scarce. The Sdic multigene family originated within the last 5.4 myr in the lineage that leads to D. melanogaster and encodes a sperm dynein intermediate chain presumably involved in sperm motility. The silencing of the Sdic multigene family, followed by the screening of relevant phenotypes, supports the role of the Sdic multigene family in sperm competition. The case of the Sdic multigene family illustrates the flexibility of genetic networks in incorporating lineage-specific gene novelties that can trigger an evolutionary arms race between males.",2012,"Shu-Dan Yeh, Tiffanie Do, Mashya Abbassi, JosÃ© M Ranz, Shu-Dan Yeh, Tiffanie Do, Mashya Abbassi, JosÃ© M Ranz"

A biomechanical analysis of ventral furrow formation in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo,22511944,10.1371/journal.pone.0034473,"The article provides a biomechanical analysis of ventral furrow formation in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo. Ventral furrow formation is the first large-scale morphogenetic movement in the fly embryo. It involves deformation of a uniform cellular monolayer formed following cellularisation, and has therefore long been used as a simple system in which to explore the role of mechanics in force generation. Here we use a quantitative framework to carry out a systematic perturbation analysis to determine the role of each of the active forces observed. The analysis confirms that ventral furrow invagination arises from a combination of apical constriction and apical-basal shortening forces in the mesoderm, together with a combination of ectodermal forces. We show that the mesodermal forces are crucial for invagination: the loss of apical constriction leads to a loss of the furrow, while the mesodermal radial shortening forces are the primary cause of the internalisation of the future mesoderm as the furrow rises. Ectodermal forces play a minor but significant role in furrow formation: without ectodermal forces the furrow is slower to form, does not close properly and has an aberrant morphology. Nevertheless, despite changes in the active mesodermal and ectodermal forces lead to changes in the timing and extent of furrow, invagination is eventually achieved in most cases, implying that the system is robust to perturbation and therefore over-determined.",2012,"Vito Conte, Florian Ulrich, Buzz Baum, Jose MuÃ±oz, Jim Veldhuis, Wayne Brodland, Mark Miodownik, Vito Conte, Florian Ulrich, Buzz Baum, Jose MuÃ±oz, Jim Veldhuis, Wayne Brodland, Mark Miodownik"
Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for invasive aspergillosis,22328395,10.1007/978-1-61779-539-8_32,"Mammalian hosts have traditionally been considered the ""gold standard"" models for studying pathogenesis and antifungal drug activity in invasive aspergillosis (IA). Nevertheless, logistical, economical, and ethical constraints make these host systems difficult to use for high-throughput screening of putative Aspergillus virulence factors and novel antifungal compounds. Here, we present Drosophila melanogaster, a heterologous non-vertebrate host with conserved innate immunity and genetic tractability, as an alternative, easy-to-use, and inexpensive pathosystem for studying Aspergillus pathogenesis and antifungal activity. We describe three different infection protocols (i.e., injection, rolling, ingestion) that introduce Aspergillus conidia at different anatomical sites of Toll-deficient Drosophila flies. These reproducible assays can be used to (1) determine the virulence of various Aspergillus strains and to (2) assess the anti-Aspergillus activity of orally absorbed antifungal agents in vivo.

Chromosome conformation capture on chip in single Drosophila melanogaster tissues,22525789,10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.04.003,"Chromosomes are protein-DNA complexes that encode life. In a cell nucleus, chromosomes are folded in a highly specific manner, which connects strongly to some of their paramount functions, such as DNA replication and gene transcription. Chromosome conformation capture methodologies allow researchers to detect chromosome folding, by quantitatively measuring which genomic sequences are in close proximity in nuclear space. Here, we describe a modified chromosome conformation capture on chip (4C) protocol, which is specifically designed for detection of chromosome folding in a single Drosophila melanogaster tissue. Our protocol enables 4C analyses on a limited number of cells, which is crucial for fly tissues, because these contain relatively low numbers of cells. We used this protocol to demonstrate that target genes of Polycomb group proteins interact with each other in nuclear space of third instar larval brain cells. Major benefits of using D. melanogaster in 4C studies are: (1) powerful and tractable genetic approaches can be incorporated; (2) short generation time allows use of complex genotypes; and (3) compact and well annotated genome. We anticipate that our sensitized 4C method will be generally applicable to detect chromosome folding in other fly tissues.",2012,"Bas Tolhuis, Marleen Blom, Maarten van Lohuizen, Bas Tolhuis, Marleen Blom, Maarten van Lohuizen"
"Crystal structure of Diedel, a marker of the immune response of Drosophila melanogaster",22442689,10.1371/journal.pone.0033416,"Background:
      
    

    
      The Drosophila melanogaster gene CG11501 is up regulated after a septic injury and was proposed to act as a negative regulator of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Diedel, the CG11501 gene product, is a small protein of 115 residues with 10 cysteines.
    

    
  


        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      We have produced Diedel in Drosophila S2 cells as an extra cellular protein thanks to its own signal peptide and solved its crystal structure at 1.15 ? resolution by SIRAS using an iodo derivative. Diedel is composed of two sub domains SD1 and SD2. SD1 is made of an antiparallel Î²-sheet covered by an Î±-helix and displays a ferredoxin-like fold. SD2 reveals a new protein fold made of loops connected by four disulfide bridges. Further structural analysis identified conserved hydrophobic residues on the surface of Diedel that may constitute a potential binding site. The existence of two conformations, cis and trans, for the proline 52 may be of interest as prolyl peptidyl isomerisation has been shown to play a role in several physiological mechanisms. The genome of D. melanogaster contains two other genes coding for proteins homologous to Diedel, namely CG43228 and CG34329. Strikingly, apart from Drosophila and the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, Diedel-related sequences were exclusively identified in a few insect DNA viruses of the Baculoviridae and Ascoviridae families.
    

    
  


        Conclusion/significance:
      
    

    
      Diedel, a marker of the Drosophila antimicrobial/antiviral response, is a member of a small family of proteins present in drosophilids, aphids and DNA viruses infecting lepidopterans. Diedel is an extracellular protein composed of two sub-domains. Two special structural features (hydrophobic surface patch and cis/trans conformation for proline 52) may indicate a putative interaction site, and support an extra cellular signaling function for Diedel, which is in accordance with its proposed role as negative regulator of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.",2012,"Franck Coste, Cordula Kemp, Vanessa Bobezeau, Charles Hetru, Christine Kellenberger, Jean-Luc Imler, Alain Roussel, Franck Coste, Cordula Kemp, Vanessa Bobezeau, Charles Hetru, Christine Kellenberger, Jean-Luc Imler, Alain Roussel"

We review the current state of knowledge regarding adult hormone production and titers and discuss receptor expression and activity in order to identify potential mechanisms which explain the observed mutant phenotypes. Finally, we describe future research directions focused on identifying isoform-specific functions of EcR, distinguishing effects from EcR/USP gene activation and repression, and determining how ecdysone signaling impacts different tissue types.",2012,"Christoph C Schwedes, Ginger E Carney, Christoph C Schwedes, Ginger E Carney"
Evolution of BMP signaling in Drosophila oogenesis: a receptor-based mechanism,22768927,10.1016/j.bpj.2012.03.026,"The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway is a conserved regulator of cellular and developmental processes in animals. The mechanisms underlying BMP signaling activation differ among tissues and mostly reflect changes in the expression of pathway components. BMP signaling is one of the major pathways responsible for the patterning of the Drosophila eggshell, a complex structure derived from a layer of follicle cells (FCs) surrounding the developing oocyte. Activation of BMP signaling in the FCs is dynamic. Initially, signaling is along the anterior-posterior (A/P) axis; later, signaling acquires dorsal-ventral (D/V) polarity. These dynamics are regulated by changes in the expression pattern of the type I BMP receptor thickveins (tkv). We recently found that signaling dynamics and TKV patterning are highly correlated in the FCs of multiple Drosophila species. In addition, we showed that signaling patterns are spatially different among species. Here, we use a mathematical model to simulate the dynamics and differences of BMP signaling in numerous species. This model predicts that qualitative and quantitative changes in receptor expression can lead to differences in the spatial pattern of BMP signaling. We tested these predications experimentally in three different Drosophila species and through genetic perturbations of BMP signaling in D. melanogaster. On the basis of our results, we concluded that changes in tkv patterning can account for the experimentally observed differences in the patterns of BMP signaling in multiple Drosophila species.",2012,"Matthew G Niepielko, Kuhn Ip, Jitendra S Kanodia, Desmond S Lun, Nir Yakoby, Matthew G Niepielko, Kuhn Ip, Jitendra S Kanodia, Desmond S Lun, Nir Yakoby"
Mink1 regulates Î²-catenin-independent Wnt signaling via Prickle phosphorylation,22037766,10.1128/MCB.06320-11,"Î²-Catenin-independent Wnt signaling pathways have been implicated in the regulation of planar cell polarity (PCP) and convergent extension (CE) cell movements. Prickle, one of the core proteins of these pathways, is known to asymmetrically localize proximally at the adherens junction of Drosophila melanogaster wing cells and to locally accumulate within plasma membrane subdomains in cells undergoing CE movements during vertebrate development. Using mass spectrometry, we have identified the Ste20 kinase Mink1 as a Prickle-associated protein and found that they genetically interact during the establishment of PCP in the Drosophila eye and CE in Xenopus laevis embryos. We show that Mink1 phosphorylates Prickle on a conserved threonine residue and regulates its Rab5-dependent endosomal trafficking, a process required for the localized plasma membrane accumulation and function of Prickle. Mink1 also was found to be important for the clustering of Vangl within plasma membrane puncta.

"Allelic imbalance in Drosophila hybrid heads: exons, isoforms, and evolution",22319150,10.1093/molbev/msr318,"Unraveling how regulatory divergence contributes to species differences and adaptation requires identifying functional variants from among millions of genetic differences. Analysis of allelic imbalance (AI) reveals functional genetic differences in cis regulation and has demonstrated differences in cis regulation within and between species. Regulatory mechanisms are often highly conserved, yet differences between species in gene expression are extensive. What evolutionary forces explain widespread divergence in cis regulation? AI was assessed in Drosophila melanogaster-Drosophila simulans hybrid female heads using RNA-seq technology. Mapping bias was virtually eliminated by using genotype-specific references. Allele representation in DNA sequencing was used as a prior in a novel Bayesian model for the estimation of AI in RNA. Cis regulatory divergence was common in the organs and tissues of the head with 41% of genes analyzed showing significant AI. Using existing population genomic data, the relationship between AI and patterns of sequence evolution was examined. Evidence of positive selection was found in 30% of cis regulatory divergent genes. Genes involved in defense, RNAi/RISC complex genes, and those that are sex regulated are enriched among adaptively evolving cis regulatory divergent genes. For genes in these groups, adaptive evolution may play a role in regulatory divergence between species. However, there is no evidence that adaptive evolution drives most of the cis regulatory divergence that is observed.

The role of Drosophila Piezo in mechanical nociception,22343891,10.1038/nature10801,"Transduction of mechanical stimuli by receptor cells is essential for senses such as hearing, touch and pain. Ion channels have a role in neuronal mechanotransduction in invertebrates; however, functional conservation of these ion channels in mammalian mechanotransduction is not observed. For example, no mechanoreceptor potential C (NOMPC), a member of transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family, acts as a mechanotransducer in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans; however, it has no orthologues in mammals. Degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) family members are mechanotransducers in C. elegans and potentially in D. melanogaster; however, a direct role of its mammalian homologues in sensing mechanical force has not been shown. Recently, Piezo1 (also known as Fam38a) and Piezo2 (also known as Fam38b) were identified as components of mechanically activated channels in mammals. The Piezo family are evolutionarily conserved transmembrane proteins. It is unknown whether they function in mechanical sensing in vivo and, if they do, which mechanosensory modalities they mediate. Here we study the physiological role of the single Piezo member in D. melanogaster (Dmpiezo; also known as CG8486). Dmpiezo expression in human cells induces mechanically activated currents, similar to its mammalian counterparts. Behavioural responses to noxious mechanical stimuli were severely reduced in Dmpiezo knockout larvae, whereas responses to another noxious stimulus or touch were not affected. Knocking down Dmpiezo in sensory neurons that mediate nociception and express the DEG/ENaC ion channel pickpocket (ppk) was sufficient to impair responses to noxious mechanical stimuli. Furthermore, expression of Dmpiezo in these same neurons rescued the phenotype of the constitutive Dmpiezo knockout larvae. Accordingly, electrophysiological recordings from ppk-positive neurons revealed a Dmpiezo-dependent, mechanically activated current. Finally, we found that Dmpiezo and ppk function in parallel pathways in ppk-positive cells, and that mechanical nociception is abolished in the absence of both channels. These data demonstrate the physiological relevance of the Piezo family in mechanotransduction in vivo, supporting a role of Piezo proteins in mechanosensory nociception.",2012,"Sung Eun Kim, Bertrand Coste, Abhishek Chadha, Boaz Cook, Ardem Patapoutian, Sung Eun Kim, Bertrand Coste, Abhishek Chadha, Boaz Cook, Ardem Patapoutian"
CHD1 contributes to intestinal resistance against infection by P. aeruginosa in Drosophila melanogaster,22912810,10.1371/journal.pone.0043144,"Drosophila SNF2-type ATPase CHD1 catalyzes the assembly and remodeling of nucleosomal arrays in vitro and is involved in H3.3 incorporation in viin vivo during early embryo development. Evidence for a role as transcriptional regulator comes from its colocalization with elongating RNA polymerase II as well as from studies of fly Hsp70 transcription. Here we used microarray analysis to identify target genes of CHD1. We found a fraction of genes that were misregulated in Chd1 mutants to be functionally linked to Drosophila immune and stress response. Infection experiments using different microbial species revealed defects in host defense in Chd1-deficient adults upon oral infection with P. aeruginosa but not upon septic injury, suggesting a so far unrecognized role for CHD1 in intestinal immunity. Further molecular analysis showed that gut-specific transcription of antimicrobial peptide genes was overactivated in the absence of infection in Chd1 mutant flies. Moreover, microbial colonization of the intestine was elevated in Chd1 mutants and oral infection resulted in strong enrichment of bacteria in the body cavity indicating increased microbial passage across intestinal epithelia. However, we did not detect enhanced epithelial damage or alterations of the intestinal stem cell population. Collectively, our data provide evidence that intestinal resistance against infection by P. aeruginosa in Drosophila is linked to maintaining proper balance of gut-microbe interactions and that the chromatin remodeler CHD1 is involved in regulating this aspect.",2012,"Johanna Sebald, Stefano Morettini, Valerie Podhraski, Cornelia Lass-FlÃ¶rl, Alexandra Lusser, Johanna Sebald, Stefano Morettini, Valerie Podhraski, Cornelia Lass-FlÃ¶rl, Alexandra Lusser"

However, we have observed abnormal wing phenotypes; this is a result of the activity of critical wing developing genes, e.g., components of the Notch or Wg pathway, that are up- or down-regulated under the control of the GMR-GAL4 driver. X-gal staining confirmed that UAS-LacZ is expressed in third-instar larva wing imaginal discs, as well as in eye discs, when driven by the GMR-GAL4 driver. Furthermore, we found that GMR-GAL4 also drives UAS-LacZ expression in other tissues, such as brain, trachea, and leg discs.

Evolution and function of the extended miR-2 microRNA family,22336713,10.4161/rna.19160,"MicroRNAs are essential post-transcriptional regulators. Many animal microRNAs are clustered in the genome, and it has been shown that clustered microRNAs may be transcribed as a single transcript. Polycistronic microRNAs are often members of the same family, suggesting a role of tandem duplication in the emergence of clusters. The mir-2 microRNA family is the largest in Drosophila melanogaster, with 8 members that are mostly clustered in the genome. Previous studies suggest that the copy number and genomic distribution of mir-2 family members has been subject to significant change during evolution. The effects of such changes on their function are still unknown. Here we study the evolution of function in the mir-2 family. Our analyses show that, in spite of the change in number and organization among invertebrates, most mir-2 loci produce very similar mature microRNA products. Multiple mature miR-2 sequences are predicted to target genes involved in neural development in Drosophila. These targeting properties are conserved in the distant species Caenorhabditis elegans. Duplication followed by functional diversification is frequent during protein-coding gene evolution. However, our results suggest that the production of microRNA clusters by gene duplication rarely involves functional changes. This pattern of functional redundancy among clustered paralogous microRNAs reflects birth-and-death evolutionary dynamics. However, we identified a small number of mir-2 sequences in Drosophila that may have undergone functional shifts associated with genomic rearrangements. Therefore, redundancy in microRNA families may facilitate the acquisition of novel functional features.",2012,"Antonio Marco, Katarzyna Hooks, Sam Griffiths-Jones, Antonio Marco, Katarzyna Hooks, Sam Griffiths-Jones"

Induction of GFPRNAi construct also alters the response of lifespan to nutrition, exacerbating the lifespan-shortening effects of food containing a high quantity of yeast.

Population transcriptomics of cactus host shifts in Drosophila mojavensis,22512269,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05549.x,"In the presence of environmental change, natural selection can shape the transcriptome. Under a scenario of environmental change, genotypes that are better able to modulate gene expression to maximize fitness will tend to be favoured. Therefore, it is important to examine gene expression at the population level to distinguish random or neutral gene expression variation from the pattern produced by natural selection. This study investigates the natural variation in transcriptional response to a cactus host shift utilizing the mainland Sonora population of Drosophila mojavensis. Drosophila mojavensis is a cactophilic species composed of four cactus host populations endemic to the deserts of North America. Overall, the change in cactus host was associated with a significant reduction in larval viability as well as the differential expression of 21% of the genome (3109 genes). Among the genes identified were a set of genes previously known to be involved in xenobiotic metabolism, as well as genes involved in cellular energy production, oxidoreductase/carbohydrate metabolism, structural components and mRNA binding. Interestingly, of the 3109 genes whose expression was affected by host use, there was a significant overrepresentation of genes that lacked an orthologous call to the D. melanogaster genome, suggesting the possibility of an accelerated rate of evolution in these genes. Of the genes with a significant cactus effect, the majority, 2264 genes, did not exhibit a significant cactus-by-line interaction.

We describe the structure of the Drosophila Adar locus and use ModENCODE information to supplement published data on Adar gene transcription, and splicing. We discuss the roles of ADAR in Drosophila in terms of the two main types of RNA molecules edited and roles of ADARs as RNA-binding proteins. Site-specific RNA editing events in transcripts encoding ion channel subunits were initially found serendipitously and subsequent directed searches for editing sites and transcriptome sequencing have now led to 972 edited sites being identified in 597 transcripts. Four percent of D. melanogaster transcripts are site-specifically edited and these encode a wide range of largely membrane-associated proteins expressed particularly in CNS. Electrophysiological studies on the effects of specific RNA editing events on ion channel subunits do not suggest that loss of RNA editing events in ion channels consistently produce a particular outcome such as making Adar mutant neurons more excitable. This possibility would have been consistent with neurodegeneration seen in Adar mutant fly brains. A further set of ADAR targets are dsRNA intermediates in siRNA generation, derived from transposons and from structured RNA loci. Transcripts with convergent overlapping 3' ends are also edited and the first discovered instance of RNA editing in Drosophila, in the Rnp4F transcript, is an example. There is no evidence yet to show that Adar antagonizes RNA interference in Drosophila. Evidence has been obtained that catalytically inactive ADAR proteins exert effects on microRNA generation and RNA interference.

In Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells, three MT tip-localizing proteins, Msps/XMAP215, EB1, and Sentin (an EB1 cargo protein), have been identified as being critical for accelerating MT growth and promoting catastrophe events, thus resulting in the formation of dynamic MTs. However, the molecular activity of each protein and the basis of the modulation of MT dynamics by these three factors are unknown. In this paper, we showed in vitro that XMAP215(msps) had a potent growth-promoting activity at a wide range of tubulin concentrations, whereas Sentin, when recruited by EB1 to the growing MT tip, accelerated growth and also increased catastrophe frequency. When all three factors were combined, the growth rate was synergistically enhanced, and rescue events were observed most frequently, but frequent catastrophes restrained the lengthening of the MTs. We propose that MT dynamics are promoted by the independent as well as the cooperative action of XMAP215(msps) polymerase and the EB1-Sentin duo.",2012,"Wenjing Li, Takashi Moriwaki, Tomomi Tani, Takashi Watanabe, Kozo Kaibuchi, Gohta Goshima, Wenjing Li, Takashi Moriwaki, Tomomi Tani, Takashi Watanabe, Kozo Kaibuchi, Gohta Goshima"
Conversion of the chill susceptible fruit fly larva (Drosophila melanogaster) to a freeze tolerant organism,22331891,10.1073/pnas.1119986109,"Among vertebrates, only a few species of amphibians and reptiles tolerate the formation of ice crystals in their body fluids. Freeze tolerance is much more widespread in invertebrates, especially in overwintering insects. Evolutionary adaptations for freeze tolerance are considered to be highly complex. Here we show that surprisingly simple laboratory manipulations can change the chill susceptible insect to the freeze tolerant one. Larvae of Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly of tropical origin with a weak innate capacity to tolerate mild chilling, can survive when approximately 50% of their body water freezes. To achieve this goal, synergy of two fundamental prerequisites is required: (i) shutdown of larval development by exposing larvae to low temperatures (dormancy) and (ii) incorporating the free amino acid proline in tissues by feeding larvae a proline-augmented diet (cryopreservation).",2012,"VladimÃ­r KoÅ¡tÃ¡l, Petr ?imek, Helena ZahradnÃ­?kovÃ¡, Jana CimlovÃ¡, TomÃ¡Å¡ ?t?tina, VladimÃ­r KoÅ¡tÃ¡l, Petr ?imek, Helena ZahradnÃ­?kovÃ¡, Jana CimlovÃ¡, TomÃ¡Å¡ ?t?tina"
Properties and secretory mechanism of Musca domestica digestive chymotrypsin and its relation with Drosophila melanogaster homologs,22808532,10.1016/j.ibmb.2012.03.005,"Musca domestica larvae present two different digestive chymotryptic activities found in the posterior midgut (PMG): one major soluble activity in the lumen and another minor present in cell membrane fractions. Both soluble and membrane-bound chymotryptic activities have different half lives of thermal inactivation (46 Â°C) in the presence and absence of 10 mM Triton X-100, indicating that they are two different molecular species. Purified soluble chymotryptic activity has pH optimum 7.4 and a molecular mass of 28 kDa in SDS-PAGE. It does not cleave short substrates, such as Suc-F-MCA, preferring longer substrates, such as Suc-AAPF-MCA, with a primary specificity (kcat/Km) for Phe rather than Tyr and Leu residues. In-gel activity revealed a unique band against S-AAPF-MCA with the same migration as purified chymotrypsin. One chymotrypsinogen-like sequence (MdChy1) was sequenced, cloned and recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli (DE3) Star. MdChy1 is expressed in the proximal posterior midgut (PMG1), as seen by RT-PCR. Expression analysis of other chymotrypsin genes revealed genes expressed at the anterior midgut (AMG) and PMG. Western blot of M. domestica midgut tissues using anti-MdChy1 antiserum showed a single band in samples from AMG and PMG, co-migrating with recombinant and purified enzymes. Immunogold labeling corresponding to Mdchy1 was found in small vesicles (thus indicating exocytosis) and in the lumen of AMG and PMG, corroborating the existence of two similar groups of chymotrypsins. Transcriptomes of M. domestica AMG and whole midgut prepared by pyrosequencing disclosed 41 unique sequences of chymotrypsin-like enzymes (19 probably functional), from which MdChy1 is highly expressed.

A molten globule-to-ordered structure transition of Drosophila melanogaster crammer is required for its ability to inhibit cathepsin,22150223,10.1042/BJ20111360,"Drosophila melanogaster crammer is a novel cathepsin inhibitor that is involved in LTM (long-term memory) formation. The mechanism by which the inhibitory activity is regulated remains unclear. In the present paper we have shown that the oligomeric state of crammer is pH dependent. At neutral pH, crammer is predominantly dimeric in vitro as a result of disulfide bond formation, and is monomeric at acidic pH. Our inhibition assay shows that monomeric crammer, not disulfide-bonded dimer, is a strong competitive inhibitor of cathepsin L. Crammer is a monomeric molten globule in acidic solution, a condition that is similar to the environment in the lysosome where crammer is probably located. Upon binding to cathepsin L, however, crammer undergoes a molten globule-to-ordered structural transition. Using high-resolution NMR spectroscopy, we have shown that a cysteine-to-serine point mutation at position 72 (C72S) renders crammer monomeric at pH 6.0 and that the structure of the C72S variant highly resembles that of wild-type crammer in complex with cathepsin L at pH 4.0.

Huntingtin aggregation kinetics and their pathological role in a Drosophila Huntington's disease model,22095086,10.1534/genetics.111.133710,"Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder resulting from expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the Huntingtin protein. Mutant Huntingtin forms intracellular aggregates within neurons, although it is unclear whether aggregates or more soluble forms of the protein represent the pathogenic species. To examine the link between aggregation and neurodegeneration, we generated Drosophila melanogaster transgenic strains expressing fluorescently tagged human huntingtin encoding pathogenic (Q138) or nonpathogenic (Q15) proteins, allowing in vivo imaging of Huntingtin expression and aggregation in live animals. Neuronal expression of pathogenic Huntingtin leads to pharate adult lethality, accompanied by formation of large aggregates within the cytoplasm of neuronal cell bodies and neurites. Live imaging and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) analysis of pathogenic Huntingtin demonstrated that new aggregates can form in neurons within 12 hr, while preexisting aggregates rapidly accumulate new Huntingtin protein within minutes. To examine the role of aggregates in pathology, we conducted haplo-insufficiency suppressor screens for Huntingtin-Q138 aggregation or Huntingtin-Q138-induced lethality, using deficiencies covering ~80% of the Drosophila genome. We identified two classes of interacting suppressors in our screen: those that rescue viability while decreasing Huntingtin expression and aggregation and those that rescue viability without disrupting Huntingtin aggregation. The most robust suppressors reduced both soluble and aggregated Huntingtin levels, suggesting toxicity is likely to be associated with both forms of the mutant protein in Huntington's disease.",2012,"Kurt R Weiss, Yoko Kimura, Wyan-Ching Mimi Lee, J Troy Littleton, Kurt R Weiss, Yoko Kimura, Wyan-Ching Mimi Lee, J Troy Littleton"

Determining the genetic basis of signal divergence will help to understand signal evolution by sexual selection and its role in the speciation process. An earlier study investigated quantitative trait locus for male courtship song carrier frequency (FRE) in Drosophila montana using microsatellite markers. We refined this study by adding to the linkage map markers for 10 candidate genes known to affect song production in Drosophila melanogaster. We also extended the analyses to additional song characters (pulse train length (PTL), pulse number (PN), interpulse interval, pulse length (PL) and cycle number (CN)). Our results indicate that loci in two different regions of the genome control distinct features of the courtship song. Pulse train traits (PTL and PN) mapped to the X chromosome, showing significant linkage with the period gene. In contrast, characters related to song pulse properties (PL, CN and carrier FRE) mapped to the region of chromosome 2 near the candidate gene fruitless, identifying these genes as suitable loci for further investigations.

We compared mating and nonmating individuals to test whether mating was nonrandom with respect to relatedness. Consistent with optimal inbreeding, males were more closely related to their mate than to randomly sampled females. However, all individuals collected mating showed higher relatedness and males were not significantly more related to their mate than to other mating females. We also found a negative relationship between relatedness and fecundity.

Destruction complex function in the Wnt signaling pathway of Drosophila requires multiple interactions between Adenomatous polyposis coli 2 and Armadillo,22174073,10.1534/genetics.111.133280,"The tumor suppressor Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) negatively regulates Wnt signaling through its activity in the destruction complex. APC binds directly to the main effector of the pathway, Î²-catenin (Î²cat, Drosophila Armadillo), and helps to target it for degradation. In vitro studies demonstrated that a nonphosphorylated 20-amino-acid repeat (20R) of APC binds to Î²cat through the N-terminal extended region of a 20R. When phosphorylated, the phospho-region of an APC 20R also binds Î²cat and the affinity is significantly increased. These distinct APC-Î²cat interactions suggest different models for the sequential steps of destruction complex activity. However, the in vivo role of 20R phosphorylation and extended region interactions has not been rigorously tested. Here we investigated the functional role of these molecular interactions by making targeted mutations in Drosophila melanogaster APC2 that disrupt phosphorylation and extended region interactions and deletion mutants missing the Armadillo binding repeats. We tested the ability of these mutants to regulate Wnt signaling in APC2 null and in APC2 APC1 double-null embryos. Overall, our in vivo data support the role of phosphorylation and extended region interactions in APC2's destruction complex function, but suggest that the extended region plays a more significant functional role. Furthermore, we show that the Drosophila 20Rs with homology to the vertebrate APC repeats that have the highest affinity for Î²cat are functionally dispensable, contrary to biochemical predictions. Finally, for some mutants, destruction complex function was dependent on APC1, suggesting that APC2 and APC1 may act cooperatively in the destruction complex.",2012,"Ezgi Kunttas-Tatli, Meng-Ning Zhou, Sandra Zimmerman, Olivia Molinar, Fangyuan Zhouzheng, Krista Carter, Megha Kapur, Alys Cheatle, Richard Decal, Brooke M McCartney, Ezgi Kunttas-Tatli, Meng-Ning Zhou, Sandra Zimmerman, Olivia Molinar, Fangyuan Zhouzheng, Krista Carter, Megha Kapur, Alys Cheatle, Richard Decal, Brooke M McCartney"
Sex-specific effects of developmental environment on reproductive trait expression in Drosophila melanogaster,22957145,10.1002/ece3.243,"Variation in the expression of reproductive traits provides the raw material upon which sexual selection can act. It is therefore important to understand how key factors such as environmental variation influence the expression of reproductive traits, as these will have a fundamental effect on the evolution of mating systems. It is also important to consider the effects of environmental variation upon reproductive traits in both sexes and to make comparisons with the environment to which the organism is adapted. In this study, we addressed these issues in a systematic study of the effect of a key environmental factor, variation in larval density, on reproductive trait expression in male and female Drosophila melanogaster. To do this, we compared reproductive trait expression when flies were reared under controlled conditions at eight different larval densities that covered a 20-fold range. Then, to place these results in a relevant context, we compared the results to those from flies sourced directly from stock cages. Many reproductive traits were surprisingly insensitive to variation in larval density. A notable exception was nonlinear variation in female fecundity. In contrast, we found much bigger differences in comparisons with flies from stock cages-including differences in body size, latency to mate, copulation duration, fecundity, and male share of paternity in a competitive environment. For a number of traits, even densities of 1000 larvae per vial (125 larvae per mL of food) did not phenocopy stock cage individuals. This study reveals novel patterns of sex-specific sensitivity to environmental variation that will influence the strength of sexual selection. It also illustrates the importance of comparisons with the environment to which individuals are adapted.",2012,"Dominic A Edward, Tracey Chapman, Dominic A Edward, Tracey Chapman"
Evolution of foraging behaviour in response to chronic malnutrition in Drosophila melanogaster,22696523,10.1098/rspb.2012.0966,"Chronic exposure to food of low quality may exert conflicting selection pressures on foraging behaviour. On the one hand, more active search behaviour may allow the animal to find patches with slightly better, or more, food; on the other hand, such active foraging is energetically costly, and thus may be opposed by selection for energetic efficiency. Here, we test these alternative hypotheses in Drosophila larvae. We show that populations which experimentally evolved improved tolerance to larval chronic malnutrition have shorter foraging path length than unselected control populations. A behavioural polymorphism in foraging path length (the rover-sitter polymorphism) exists in nature and is attributed to the foraging locus (for). We show that a sitter strain (for(s2)) survives better on the poor food than the rover strain (for(R)), confirming that the sitter foraging strategy is advantageous under malnutrition. Larvae of the selected and control populations did not differ in global for expression. However, a quantitative complementation test suggests that the for locus may have contributed to the adaptation to poor food in one of the selected populations, either through a change in for allele frequencies, or by interacting epistatically with alleles at other loci. Irrespective of its genetic basis, our results provide two independent lines of evidence that sitter-like foraging behaviour is favoured under chronic larval malnutrition.",2012,"Roshan K Vijendravarma, Sunitha Narasimha, Tadeusz J Kawecki, Roshan K Vijendravarma, Sunitha Narasimha, Tadeusz J Kawecki"

We found a positive relationship between thermotolerance and the patterns of hsp90 transcript expression in both species.

A secreted MMP is required for reepithelialization during wound healing,22262460,10.1091/mbc.E11-09-0745,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are extracellular proteases highly expressed at wound sites. However, the precise function of MMPs during reepithelialization in vivo has been elusive in mammalian models because of the high level of redundancy among the 24 mammalian MMPs. For this reason we used Drosophila melanogaster, whose genome encodes only two MMPs-one secreted type (Mmp1) and one membrane-anchored type (Mmp2)-to study the function and regulation of the secreted class of MMPs in vivo. In the absence of redundancy, we found that the Drosophila secreted MMP, Mmp1, is required in the epidermis to facilitate reepithelialization by remodeling the basement membrane, promoting cell elongation and actin cytoskeletal reorganization, and activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling. In addition, we report that the jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway upregulates Mmp1 expression after wounding, but that Mmp1 is expressed independent of the JNK pathway in unwounded epidermis. When the JNK pathway is ectopically activated to overexpress Mmp1, the rate of healing is accelerated in an Mmp1-dependent manner. A primary function of Mmp1, under the control of the JNK pathway, is to promote basement membrane repair, which in turn may permit cell migration and the restoration of a continuous tissue.",2012,"Laura J Stevens, Andrea Page-McCaw, Laura J Stevens, Andrea Page-McCaw"

Genetic variation in odorant receptors contributes to variation in olfactory behavior in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster,22038943,10.1093/chemse/bjr097,"Chemoreception is a principle modality by which organisms gain information from their environment, and extensive variation in odor-mediated behavior has been documented within and among species. To examine the mechanisms by which sensory systems mediate these responses, we ask to what extent variation in Drosophila melanogaster odorant receptor genes contributes to variation in odor-mediated behavior. Significant differences in behavioral responses to structurally similar odorants, methyl hexanoate and ethyl hexanoate, were found in a natural population. Polymorphisms in 3 genomic regions (Or22a/Or22b, Or35a, and Or47a) were identified and associated with variation in behavior to these esters. Overall similarity in association profiles for both odorants was observed, except for Or47a in which polymorphisms were associated solely with variation in responses to ethyl hexanoate. Our analyses were then extended to examine polymorphisms in 3 odorant receptors previously reported to contribute to variation in olfactory behavior for the chemically distinct odorants benzaldehyde and acetophenone. Two Or10a polymorphisms were associated with variation in response to ethyl hexanoate. Finally, differences in Or35a and Or47a expression were associated with variation in responses to ethyl hexanoate. These results demonstrate that the genetic variation at the peripheral sensory stage plays a role in mediating differences in odor-mediated behavior.",2012,"P K Richgels, S M Rollmann, P K Richgels, S M Rollmann"

Prion-induced toxicity in PrP transgenic Drosophila,22314254,10.1016/j.yexmp.2012.01.005,"Prion diseases are fatal transmissible neurodegenerative diseases of humans and various vertebrate species. In their natural hosts these conditions are characterised by prolonged incubation times prior to the onset of clinical signs of terminal disease. Accordingly, tractable models of mammalian prion disease are required in order to better understand the mechanisms of prion replication and prion-induced neurotoxicity. Transmission of prion diseases can occur across a species barrier and this is facilitated in recipients transgenic for the same PrP gene as the individual from which the infectious prions are derived. Here we have tested the hypothesis that exogenous ovine prions can induce neurotoxicity in Drosophila melanogaster transgenic for ovine PrP. Drosophila that expressed ovine PrP pan neuronally and inoculated with ovine prions at the larval stage by oral exposure to scrapie-infected sheep brain homogenate showed markedly accelerated locomotor and survival defects. ARQ PrP transgenic Drosophila exposed to scrapie-infected brain homogenate showed a significant and progressive reduction in locomotor activity compared to similar flies exposed to normal sheep brain homogenate. The prion-induced locomotor defect was accompanied by the accumulation of potentially misfolded PrP in the brains of prion-inoculated flies. VRQ PrP transgenic Drosophila, which expressed less ovine PrP than ARQ flies, showed a reduced median survival compared to similar flies exposed to normal sheep brain homogenate.

Sexual selection is ineffectual or inhibits the purging of deleterious mutations in Drosophila melanogaster,22759290,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01584.x,"The effects of sexual selection on population mean fitness are unclear and a subject of debate. Recent models propose that, because reproductive success may be condition dependent, much of the genome may be a target of sexual selection. Under this scenario, mutations that reduce health, and thus nonsexual fitness, may also be deleterious with respect to reproductive success, meaning that sexual selection may contribute to the purging of deleterious alleles. We tested this hypothesis directly by subjecting replicate Drosophila melanogaster populations to two treatments that altered the opportunity for sexual selection and then tracked changes in the frequency of six separate deleterious alleles with recessive and visible phenotypic effects. While natural selection acted to decrease the frequency of all six mutations, the addition of sexual selection did not aid in the purging of any of them, and for three of them appears to have hampered it. Courtship and mating have harmful effects in this species and mate choice assays showed that males directed more courtship and mating behavior toward wild-type over mutant females, providing a likely explanation for sexual selection's cost. Whether this cost extends to other mutations (e.g., those lacking visible phenotypic effects) is an important topic for future research.",2012,"Devin Arbuthnott, Howard D Rundle, Devin Arbuthnott, Howard D Rundle"
Sex-biased mortality associated with inbreeding in Drosophila melanogaster,24636623,10.1186/1471-2148-14-51,"Background:
      
    

    
      One proposed consequence of inbreeding is a skewed sex ratio arising from sex specific mortality in the homogametic sex caused by inbreeding on the sex chromosome. However, recent work suggests that random distortions in sex ratio due to autosomal inbreeding may be of greater importance. In this study, we investigate the effect of biologically realistic levels of inbreeding on sex ratio and sex specific mortality in Drosophila melanogaster. We use two pedigree crossing designs to either maximise or minimise inbreeding on the X-chromosome whilst producing identical autosomal inbreeding.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We found increased female mortality and male biased sex ratios associated with inbreeding in our high, but not low, X-inbreeding pedigree. While our results are more consistent with being driven by inbreeding on the X-chromosome than on the autosomes, the marked difference between treatments does not fit closely the expectations of either model.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our results are only partly consistent with the hypothesis that inbreeding on the X-chromosome can cause greater fitness reductions in the homogametic sex. Whilst the results of our study are not conclusive, they suggest that directional distortions in sex ratio due to inbreeding can occur, and highlight the need for further investigation on this topic.",2014,"Stephen P Robinson, Leigh W Simmons, W Jason Kennington, Stephen P Robinson, Leigh W Simmons, W Jason Kennington"

Novel Drosophila viruses encode host-specific suppressors of RNAi,25032815,10.1371/journal.ppat.1004256,"The ongoing conflict between viruses and their hosts can drive the co-evolution between host immune genes and viral suppressors of immunity. It has been suggested that an evolutionary 'arms race' may occur between rapidly evolving components of the antiviral RNAi pathway of Drosophila and viral genes that antagonize it. We have recently shown that viral protein 1 (VP1) of Drosophila melanogaster Nora virus (DmelNV) suppresses Argonaute-2 (AGO2)-mediated target RNA cleavage (slicer activity) to antagonize antiviral RNAi. Here we show that viral AGO2 antagonists of divergent Nora-like viruses can have host specific activities. We have identified novel Nora-like viruses in wild-caught populations of D. immigrans (DimmNV) and D. subobscura (DsubNV) that are 36% and 26% divergent from DmelNV at the amino acid level. We show that DimmNV and DsubNV VP1 are unable to suppress RNAi in D. melanogaster S2 cells, whereas DmelNV VP1 potently suppresses RNAi in this host species. Moreover, we show that the RNAi suppressor activity of DimmNV VP1 is restricted to its natural host species, D. immigrans. Specifically, we find that DimmNV VP1 interacts with D. immigrans AGO2, but not with D. melanogaster AGO2, and that it suppresses slicer activity in embryo lysates from D. immigrans, but not in lysates from D. melanogaster. This species-specific interaction is reflected in the ability of DimmNV VP1 to enhance RNA production by a recombinant Sindbis virus in a host-specific manner. Our results emphasize the importance of analyzing viral RNAi suppressor activity in the relevant host species. We suggest that rapid co-evolution between RNA viruses and their hosts may result in host species-specific activities of RNAi suppressor proteins, and therefore that viral RNAi suppressors could be host-specificity factors.",2014,"JoÃ«l T van Mierlo, Gijs J Overheul, Benjamin Obadia, Koen W R van Cleef, Claire L Webster, Maria-Carla Saleh, Darren J Obbard, Ronald P van Rij, JoÃ«l T van Mierlo, Gijs J Overheul, Benjamin Obadia, Koen W R van Cleef, Claire L Webster, Maria-Carla Saleh, Darren J Obbard, Ronald P van Rij"
A distinct type of heterochromatin at the telomeric region of the Drosophila melanogaster Y chromosome,24475122,10.1371/journal.pone.0086451,"Heterochromatin assembly and its associated phenotype, position effect variegation (PEV), provide an informative system to study chromatin structure and genome packaging. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the Y chromosome is entirely heterochromatic in all cell types except the male germline; as such, Y chromosome dosage is a potent modifier of PEV. However, neither Y heterochromatin composition, nor its assembly, has been carefully studied. Here, we report the mapping and characterization of eight reporter lines that show male-specific PEV. In all eight cases, the reporter insertion sites lie in the telomeric transposon array (HeT-A and TART-B2 homologous repeats) of the Y chromosome short arm (Ys). Investigations of the impact on the PEV phenotype of mutations in known heterochromatin proteins (i.e., modifiers of PEV) show that this Ys telomeric region is a unique heterochromatin domain: it displays sensitivity to mutations in HP1a, EGG and SU(VAR)3-9, but no sensitivity to Su(z)2 mutations. It appears that the endo-siRNA pathway plays a major targeting role for this domain. Interestingly, an ectopic copy of 1360 is sufficient to induce a piRNA targeting mechanism to further enhance silencing of a reporter cytologically localized to the Ys telomere. These results demonstrate the diversity of heterochromatin domains, and the corresponding variation in potential targeting mechanisms.",2014,"Sidney H Wang, Ruth Nan, Maria C Accardo, Monica Sentmanat, Patrizio Dimitri, Sarah C R Elgin, Sidney H Wang, Ruth Nan, Maria C Accardo, Monica Sentmanat, Patrizio Dimitri, Sarah C R Elgin"
Transcriptomic analysis of sexual differentiation in somatic tissues of Drosophila melanogaster: successes and caveats,24356334,10.1159/000357262,"The advent of high-throughput technologies to analyze RNA expression levels and transcript structure has brought renewed attention to the age-old question of what differentiates males from females. In Drosophila, the characterized somatic sex determination cascade includes proteins implicated in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing as well as at least 2 transcription factors at its base. Both DNA microarrays and RNA-Seq have been applied in a number of studies to determine the identities, expression levels and structure of transcripts expressed differentially in the 2 sexes, with remarkably divergent results in the number, structure and identity of affected transcripts. We briefly summarize these reports and discuss the reasons for the apparent discrepancies based upon the different conditions used for sample preparation and data analysis.",2014,"M-L Samson, L Rabinow, M-L Samson, L Rabinow"
Differences in neural circuitry guiding behavioral responses to polarized light presented to either the dorsal or ventral retina in Drosophila,24912584,10.3109/01677063.2014.922556,"Linearly polarized light (POL) serves as an important cue for many animals, providing navigational information, as well as directing them toward food sources and reproduction sites. Many insects detect the celestial polarization pattern, or the linearly polarized reflections off of surfaces, such as water. Much progress has been made toward characterizing both retinal detectors and downstream circuit elements responsible for celestial POL vision in different insect species, yet much less is known about the neural basis of how polarized reflections are detected. We previously established a novel, fully automated behavioral assay for studying the spontaneous orientation response of Drosophila melanogaster populations to POL stimuli presented to either the dorsal, or the ventral halves of the retina. We identified separate retinal detectors mediating these responses: the 'Dorsal Rim Area' (DRA), which had long been implicated in celestial POL vision, as well as a previously uncharacterized 'ventral polarization area' (VPA). In this study, we investigate whether DRA and VPA use the same or different downstream circuitry, for mediating spontaneous behavioral responses. We use homozygous mutants, or molecular genetic circuit-breaking tools (silencing, as well as rescue of synaptic activity), in combination with our behavioral paradigm. We show that responses to dorsal versus ventral stimulation involve previously characterized optic lobe neurons, like lamina monopolar cell L2 and medulla cell types Dm8/Tm5c. However, using different experimental conditions, we show that important differences exist between the requirement of these cell types downstream of DRA versus VPA. Therefore, while the neural circuits underlying behavioral responses to celestial and reflected POL cues share important building blocks, these elements play different functional roles within the network.",2014,"Mariel M Velez, Daryl Gohl, Thomas R Clandinin, Mathias F Wernet, Mariel M Velez, Daryl Gohl, Thomas R Clandinin, Mathias F Wernet"
Evolution in an ancient detoxification pathway is coupled with a transition to herbivory in the drosophilidae,24974374,10.1093/molbev/msu201,"Chemically defended plant tissues present formidable barriers to herbivores. Although mechanisms to resist plant defenses have been identified in ancient herbivorous lineages, adaptations to overcome plant defenses during transitions to herbivory remain relatively unexplored. The fly genus Scaptomyza is nested within the genus Drosophila and includes species that feed on the living tissue of mustard plants (Brassicaceae), yet this lineage is derived from microbe-feeding ancestors. We found that mustard-feeding Scaptomyza species and microbe-feeding Drosophila melanogaster detoxify mustard oils, the primary chemical defenses in the Brassicaceae, using the widely conserved mercapturic acid pathway. This detoxification strategy differs from other specialist herbivores of mustard plants, which possess derived mechanisms to obviate mustard oil formation. To investigate whether mustard feeding is coupled with evolution in the mercapturic acid pathway, we profiled functional and molecular evolutionary changes in the enzyme glutathione S-transferase D1 (GSTD1), which catalyzes the first step of the mercapturic acid pathway and is induced by mustard defense products in Scaptomyza. GSTD1 acquired elevated activity against mustard oils in one mustard-feeding Scaptomyza species in which GstD1 was duplicated. Structural analysis and mutagenesis revealed that substitutions at conserved residues within and near the substrate-binding cleft account for most of this increase in activity against mustard oils. Functional evolution of GSTD1 was coupled with signatures of episodic positive selection in GstD1 after the evolution of herbivory. Overall, we found that preexisting functions of generalized detoxification systems, and their refinement by natural selection, could play a central role in the evolution of herbivory.",2014,"Andrew D Gloss, Daniel G VassÃ£o, Alexander L Hailey, Anna C Nelson Dittrich, Katharina Schramm, Michael Reichelt, Timothy J Rast, Andrzej Weichsel, Matthew G Cravens, Jonathan Gershenzon, William R Montfort, Noah K Whiteman, Andrew D Gloss, Daniel G VassÃ£o, Alexander L Hailey, Anna C Nelson Dittrich, Katharina Schramm, Michael Reichelt, Timothy J Rast, Andrzej Weichsel, Matthew G Cravens, Jonathan Gershenzon, William R Montfort, Noah K Whiteman"
Â¹Â³C NMR metabolomics: applications at natural abundance,25140385,10.1021/ac502346h,"(13)C NMR has many advantages for a metabolomics study, including a large spectral dispersion, narrow singlets at natural abundance, and a direct measure of the backbone structures of metabolites. However, it has not had widespread use because of its relatively low sensitivity compounded by low natural abundance. Here we demonstrate the utility of high-quality (13)C NMR spectra obtained using a custom (13)C-optimized probe on metabolomic mixtures. A workflow was developed to use statistical correlations between replicate 1D (13)C and (1)H spectra, leading to composite spin systems that can be used to search publicly available databases for compound identification. This was developed using synthetic mixtures and then applied to two biological samples, Drosophila melanogaster extracts and mouse serum. Using the synthetic mixtures we were able to obtain useful (13)C-(13)C statistical correlations from metabolites with as little as 60 nmol of material. The lower limit of (13)C NMR detection under our experimental conditions is approximately 40 nmol, slightly lower than the requirement for statistical analysis. The (13)C and (1)H data together led to 15 matches in the database compared to just 7 using (1)H alone, and the (13)C correlated peak lists had far fewer false positives than the (1)H generated lists. In addition, the (13)C 1D data provided improved metabolite identification and separation of biologically distinct groups using multivariate statistical analysis in the D. melanogaster extracts and mouse serum.",2014,"Chaevien S Clendinen, Brittany Lee-McMullen, Caroline M Williams, Gregory S Stupp, Krista Vandenborne, Daniel A Hahn, Glenn A Walter, Arthur S Edison, Chaevien S Clendinen, Brittany Lee-McMullen, Caroline M Williams, Gregory S Stupp, Krista Vandenborne, Daniel A Hahn, Glenn A Walter, Arthur S Edison"
Sex-biased expression of microRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster,24694940,10.1098/rsob.140024,"Most animals have separate sexes. The differential expression of gene products, in particular that of gene regulators, is underlying sexual dimorphism. Analyses of sex-biased expression have focused mostly on protein-coding genes. Several lines of evidence indicate that microRNAs, a class of major gene regulators, are likely to have a significant role in sexual dimorphism. This role has not been systematically explored so far. Here, I study the sex-biased expression pattern of microRNAs in the model species Drosophila melanogaster. As with protein-coding genes, sex-biased microRNAs are associated with the reproductive function. Strikingly, contrary to protein-coding genes, male-biased microRNAs are enriched in the X chromosome, whereas female microRNAs are mostly autosomal. I propose that the chromosomal distribution is a consequence of high rates of de novo emergence, and a preference for new microRNAs to be expressed in the testis. I also suggest that demasculinization of the X chromosome may not affect microRNAs. Interestingly, female-biased microRNAs are often encoded within protein-coding genes that are also expressed in females. MicroRNAs with sex-biased expression do not preferentially target sex-biased gene transcripts. These results strongly suggest that the sex-biased expression of microRNAs is mainly a consequence of high rates of microRNA emergence in the X chromosome (male bias) or hitchhiked expression by host genes (female bias).",2014,"Antonio Marco, Antonio Marco"
Dietary intake of Curcuma longa and Emblica officinalis increases life span in Drosophila melanogaster,24967413,10.1155/2014/910290,"Intake of food and nutrition plays a major role in affecting aging process and longevity. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the ageing process are still unclear. To this respect, diet has been considered to be a determinant of ageing process. In order to better illustrate this, we used Drosophila melanogaster as a model and fed them orally with different concentrations of two commonly used Indian medicinal plant products, Curcuma longa (rhizome) and Emblica officinalis (fruit). The results revealed significant increase in life span of Drosophila flies on exposure to both the plant products, more efficiently by C. Longa than by E. officinalis. In order to understand whether the increase in lifespan was due to high-antioxidant properties of these medicinal plants, we performed enzymatic assays to assess the SOD and catalase activities in case of both treated and control Drosophila flies. Interestingly, the results support the free radical theory of aging as both these plant derivatives show high reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activities.",2014,"Shilpa Rawal, Pavneet Singh, Ayush Gupta, Sujata Mohanty, Shilpa Rawal, Pavneet Singh, Ayush Gupta, Sujata Mohanty"
Natural variation in the strength and direction of male mating preferences for female pheromones in Drosophila melanogaster,24489930,10.1371/journal.pone.0087509,"Many animal species communicate using chemical signals. In Drosophila, cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are involved in species and sexual identification, and have long been thought to act as stimulatory pheromones as well. However, a previous study reported that D. melanogaster males were more attracted to females that were lacking CHCs. This surprising result is consistent with several evolutionary hypotheses but is at odds with other work demonstrating that female CHCs are attractive to males. Here, we investigated natural variation in male preferences for female pheromones using transgenic flies that cannot produce CHCs. By perfuming females with CHCs and performing mate choice tests, we found that some male genotypes prefer females with pheromones, some have no apparent preference, and at least one male genotype prefers females without pheromones. This variation provides an excellent opportunity to further investigate the mechanistic causes and evolutionary implications of divergent pheromone preferences in D. melanogaster males.",2014,"Alison Pischedda, Michael P Shahandeh, Wesley G Cochrane, Veronica A Cochrane, Thomas L Turner"
"A homeostatic sleep-stabilizing pathway in Drosophila composed of the sex peptide receptor and its ligand, the myoinhibitory peptide",25333796,10.1371/journal.pbio.1001974,"Sleep, a reversible quiescent state found in both invertebrate and vertebrate animals, disconnects animals from their environment and is highly regulated for coordination with wakeful activities, such as reproduction. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has proven to be a valuable model for studying the regulation of sleep by circadian clock and homeostatic mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that the sex peptide receptor (SPR) of Drosophila, known for its role in female reproduction, is also important in stabilizing sleep in both males and females. Mutants lacking either the SPR or its central ligand, myoinhibitory peptide (MIP), fall asleep normally, but have difficulty in maintaining a sleep-like state. Our analyses have mapped the SPR sleep function to pigment dispersing factor (pdf) neurons, an arousal center in the insect brain. MIP downregulates intracellular cAMP levels in pdf neurons through the SPR. MIP is released centrally before and during night-time sleep, when the sleep drive is elevated. Sleep deprivation during the night facilitates MIP secretion from specific brain neurons innervating pdf neurons. Moreover, flies lacking either SPR or MIP cannot recover sleep after the night-time sleep deprivation. These results delineate a central neuropeptide circuit that stabilizes the sleep state by feeding a slow-acting inhibitory input into the arousal system and plays an important role in sleep homeostasis.",2014,"Yangkyun Oh, Sung-Eun Yoon, Qi Zhang, Hyo-Seok Chae, Ivana DaubnerovÃ¡, Orie T Shafer, Joonho Choe, Young-Joon Kim, Yangkyun Oh, Sung-Eun Yoon, Qi Zhang, Hyo-Seok Chae, Ivana DaubnerovÃ¡, Orie T Shafer, Joonho Choe, Young-Joon Kim"

Parallel geographic variation in Drosophila melanogaster,24610860,10.1534/genetics.114.161463,"Drosophila melanogaster, an ancestrally African species, has recently spread throughout the world, associated with human activity. The species has served as the focus of many studies investigating local adaptation relating to latitudinal variation in non-African populations, especially those from the United States and Australia. These studies have documented the existence of shared, genetically determined phenotypic clines for several life history and morphological traits. However, there are no studies designed to formally address the degree of shared latitudinal differentiation at the genomic level. Here we present our comparative analysis of such differentiation. Not surprisingly, we find evidence of substantial, shared selection responses on the two continents, probably resulting from selection on standing ancestral variation. The polymorphic inversion In(3R)P has an important effect on this pattern, but considerable parallelism is also observed across the genome in regions not associated with inversion polymorphism. Interestingly, parallel latitudinal differentiation is observed even for variants that are not particularly strongly differentiated, which suggests that very large numbers of polymorphisms are targets of spatially varying selection in this species.",2014,"Josie A Reinhardt, Bryan Kolaczkowski, Corbin D Jones, David J Begun, Andrew D Kern, Josie A Reinhardt, Bryan Kolaczkowski, Corbin D Jones, David J Begun, Andrew D Kern"

"Apocrine secretion in Drosophila salivary glands: subcellular origin, dynamics, and identification of secretory proteins",24732043,10.1371/journal.pone.0094383,"In contrast to the well defined mechanism of merocrine exocytosis, the mechanism of apocrine secretion, which was first described over 180 years ago, remains relatively uncharacterized. We identified apocrine secretory activity in the late prepupal salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster just prior to the execution of programmed cell death (PCD). The excellent genetic tools available in Drosophila provide an opportunity to dissect for the first time the molecular and mechanistic aspects of this process. A prerequisite for such an analysis is to have pivotal immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, biochemical and proteomic data that fully characterize the process. Here we present data showing that the Drosophila salivary glands release all kinds of cellular proteins by an apocrine mechanism including cytoskeletal, cytosolic, mitochondrial, nuclear and nucleolar components. Surprisingly, the apocrine release of these proteins displays a temporal pattern with the sequential release of some proteins (e.g. transcription factor BR-C, tumor suppressor p127, cytoskeletal Î²-tubulin, non-muscle myosin) earlier than others (e.g. filamentous actin, nuclear lamin, mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase). Although the apocrine release of proteins takes place just prior to the execution of an apoptotic program, the nuclear DNA is never released. Western blotting indicates that the secreted proteins remain undegraded in the lumen. Following apocrine secretion, the salivary gland cells remain quite vital, as they retain highly active transcriptional and protein synthetic activity.",2014,"Robert FarkaÅ¡, Zuzana ?atkovÃ¡, Lucia MentelovÃ¡, PÃ©ter LÃ¶w, Denisa Be?ovÃ¡-LiszekovÃ¡, Milan Be?o, MiklÃ³s Sass, Pavel ?ehulka, Helena ?ehulkovÃ¡, Otakar RaÅ¡ka, LubomÃ­r KovÃ¡?ik, Jana ?migovÃ¡, Ivan RaÅ¡ka, Bernard M Mechler, Robert FarkaÅ¡, Zuzana ?atkovÃ¡, Lucia MentelovÃ¡, PÃ©ter LÃ¶w, Denisa Be?ovÃ¡-LiszekovÃ¡, Milan Be?o, MiklÃ³s Sass, Pavel ?ehulka, Helena ?ehulkovÃ¡, Otakar RaÅ¡ka, LubomÃ­r KovÃ¡?ik, Jana ?migovÃ¡, Ivan RaÅ¡ka, Bernard M Mechler"

Cdc42 genetically interacts with the cardiogenic transcription factor tinman; with dDAAM which belongs to the family of actin organizing formins; and with zipper, which encodes nonmuscle myosin II. Zipper is required for heart lumen formation, and its spatiotemporal activity at the prospective luminal surface is controlled by Cdc42. Heart-specific expression of activated Cdc42, or the regulatory formins dDAAM and Diaphanous caused mislocalization of Zipper and induced ectopic heart lumina, as characterized by luminal markers such as the extracellular matrix protein Slit.

Do males matter? Testing the effects of male genetic background on female meiotic crossover rates in Drosophila melanogaster,24889512,10.1111/evo.12455,"Meiotic recombination is a critical genetic process as well as a pivotal evolutionary force. Rates of crossing over are highly variable within and between species, due to both genetic and environmental factors. Early studies in Drosophila implicated female genetic background as a major determinant of crossover rate and recent work has highlighted male genetic background as a possible mediator as well. Our study employed classical genetics to address how female and male genetic backgrounds individually and jointly affect crossover rates. We measured rates of crossing over in a 33 cM region of the Drosophila melanogaster X chromosome using a two-step crossing scheme exploiting visible markers. In total, we measured crossover rates of 10 inbred lines in a full diallel cross. Our experimental design facilitates measuring the contributions of female genetic background, male genetic background, and female by male genetic background interaction effects on rates of crossing over in females. Our results indicate that although female genetic background significantly affects female meiotic crossover rates in Drosophila, male genetic background and the interaction of female and male genetic backgrounds have no significant effect. These findings thus suggest that male-mediated effects are unlikely to contribute greatly to variation in recombination rates in natural populations of Drosophila.",2014,"Chad M Hunter, Nadia D Singh, Chad M Hunter, Nadia D Singh"

Neprilysins: an evolutionarily conserved family of metalloproteases that play important roles in reproduction in Drosophila,24395329,10.1534/genetics.113.160945,"Members of the M13 class of metalloproteases have been implicated in diseases and in reproductive fitness. Nevertheless, their physiological role remains poorly understood. To obtain a tractable model with which to analyze this protein family's function, we characterized the gene family in Drosophila melanogaster and focused on reproductive phenotypes. The D. melanogaster genome contains 24 M13 class protease homologs, some of which are orthologs of human proteases, including neprilysin. Many are expressed in the reproductive tracts of either sex. Using RNAi we individually targeted the five Nep genes most closely related to vertebrate neprilysin, Nep1-5, to investigate their roles in reproduction. A reduction in Nep1, Nep2, or Nep4 expression in females reduced egg laying. Nep1 and Nep2 are required in the CNS and the spermathecae for wild-type fecundity. Females that are null for Nep2 also show defects as hosts of sperm competition as well as an increased rate of depletion for stored sperm. Furthermore, eggs laid by Nep2 mutant females are fertilized normally, but arrest early in embryonic development. In the male, only Nep1 was required to induce normal patterns of female egg laying. Reduction in the expression of Nep2-5 in the male did not cause any dramatic effects on reproductive fitness, which suggests that these genes are either nonessential for male fertility or perform redundant functions. Our results suggest that, consistent with the functions of neprilysins in mammals, these proteins are also required for reproduction in Drosophila, opening up this model system for further functional analysis of this protein class and their substrates.",2014,"Jessica L Sitnik, Carmen Francis, Korneel Hens, Roger Huybrechts, Mariana F Wolfner, Patrick Callaerts, Jessica L Sitnik, Carmen Francis, Korneel Hens, Roger Huybrechts, Mariana F Wolfner, Patrick Callaerts"
The relative importance of DNA methylation and Dnmt2-mediated epigenetic regulation on Wolbachia densities and cytoplasmic incompatibility,25538866,10.7717/peerj.678,"Wolbachia pipientis is a worldwide bacterial parasite of arthropods that infects germline cells and manipulates host reproduction to increase the ratio of infected females, the transmitting sex of the bacteria. The most common reproductive manipulation, cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), is expressed as embryonic death in crosses between infected males and uninfected females. Specifically, Wolbachia modify developing sperm in the testes by unknown means to cause a post-fertilization disruption of the sperm chromatin that incapacitates the first mitosis of the embryo. As these Wolbachia-induced changes are stable, reversible, and affect the host cell cycle machinery including DNA replication and chromosome segregation, we hypothesized that the host methylation pathway is targeted for modulation during cytoplasmic incompatibility because it accounts for all of these traits. Here we show that infection of the testes is associated with a 55% increase of host DNA methylation in Drosophila melanogaster, but methylation of the paternal genome does not correlate with penetrance of CI. Overexpression and knock out of the Drosophila DNA methyltransferase Dnmt2 neither induces nor increases CI. Instead, overexpression decreases Wolbachia titers in host testes by approximately 17%, leading to a similar reduction in CI levels. Finally, strength of CI induced by several different strains of Wolbachia does not correlate with levels of DNA methylation in the host testes. We conclude that DNA methylation mediated by Drosophila's only known methyltransferase is not required for the transgenerational sperm modification that causes CI.",2014,"Daniel P LePage, Kristin K Jernigan, Seth R Bordenstein, Daniel P LePage, Kristin K Jernigan, Seth R Bordenstein"
Natural Populations of Drosophila melanogaster Reveal Features of an Uncharacterized Circadian Property: The Lower Temperature Limit of Rhythmicity,24916390,10.1177/0748730414537801,"Most cyclic biological processes are under control of a circadian molecular timing system that synchronizes these phenomena to the 24-h day. One generic property of circadian-controlled processes is that they operate within a specific temperature range, below which the manifestation of rhythm ceases. Little is known about the evolutionary relevance of the lower temperature limit of rhythmicity or about the mechanism underlying the loss of overt circadian behavior below this lower limit, especially in one model organism of chronobiology, Drosophila melanogaster. Natural populations of Drosophila are evolving under divergent selection pressures and so provide a source of diversity necessary to address these issues. Using lines derived from African populations, we find that there is natural variation in the expression of rhythmic behavior under low-temperature conditions. We found evidence that this variability is evolutionarily relevant at extremely low temperature (12 Â°C) because high-altitude populations exhibit selection for locally adapted genomes that contribute to rhythmic behavior. Lines resistant to 15 Â°C show an additional layer of diversity in their response to temperature extremes because some lines are resistant to low temperature (15 Â°C) only, whereas others are cross-resistant to high and low temperature (15 Â°C and 30 Â°C). Genetic analysis of one cold-resistant circadian line at 15 Â°C reveals that the phenotype maps to the X-chromosome but not to the core clock genes, per and sgg. Analysis of the central clock cells of this line reveals that maintenance of rhythm is associated with robust clock function, which is compromised in a standard laboratory strain. These data indicate that the cold-resistant circadian phenotype is clock based. This study highlights the importance of using natural populations to inform us of the basic features of circadian traits, especially those that might be under temperature-based selection.",2014,"Sarah E Maguire, Paul S Schmidt, Amita Sehgal, Sarah E Maguire, Paul S Schmidt, Amita Sehgal"

Here we performed a microarray study to elucidate the genes, chromosomal loci, molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components that contribute to the Î±-amanitin resistance phenotype in Drosophila melanogaster. We suggest that toxin entry blockage through the cuticle, phase I and II detoxification, sequestration in lipid particles, and proteolytic cleavage of Î±-amanitin contribute in concert to this quantitative trait.

Sexual experience enhances Drosophila melanogaster male mating behavior and success,24805129,10.1371/journal.pone.0096639,"Competition for mates is a wide-spread phenomenon affecting individual reproductive success. The ability of animals to adjust their behaviors in response to changing social environment is important and well documented. Drosophila melanogaster males compete with one another for matings with females and modify their reproductive behaviors based on prior social interactions. However, it remains to be determined how male social experience that culminates in mating with a female impacts subsequent male reproductive behaviors and mating success. Here we show that sexual experience enhances future mating success. Previously mated D. melanogaster males adjust their courtship behaviors and out-compete sexually inexperienced males for copulations. Interestingly, courtship experience alone is not sufficient in providing this competitive advantage, indicating that copulation plays a role in reinforcing this social learning. We also show that females use their sense of hearing to preferentially mate with experienced males when given a choice. Our results demonstrate the ability of previously mated males to learn from their positive sexual experiences and adjust their behaviors to gain a mating advantage. These experienced-based changes in behavior reveal strategies that animals likely use to increase their fecundity in natural competitive environments.",2014,"Sehresh Saleem, Patrick H Ruggles, Wiley K Abbott, Ginger E Carney, Sehresh Saleem, Patrick H Ruggles, Wiley K Abbott, Ginger E Carney"

The relative roles of vision and chemosensation in mate recognition of Drosophila melanogaster,24902744,10.1242/jeb.105817,"Animals rely on sensory cues to classify objects in their environment and respond appropriately. However, the spatial structure of those sensory cues can greatly impact when, where and how they are perceived. In this study, we examined the relative roles of visual and chemosensory cues in the mate recognition behavior of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) using a robotic fly dummy that was programmed to interact with individual males. By pairing male flies with dummies of various shapes, sizes and speeds, or coated with different pheromones, we determined that visual and chemical cues play specific roles at different points in the courtship sequence. Vision is essential for determining whether to approach a moving object and initiate courtship, and males were more likely to begin chasing objects with the same approximate dimensions as another fly. However, whereas males were less likely to begin chasing larger dummies, once started, they would continue chasing for a similar length of time regardless of the dummy's shape. The presence of female pheromones on the moving dummy did not affect the probability that males would initiate a chase, but did influence how long they would continue chasing. Male pheromone both inhibits chase initiation and shortens chase duration. Collectively, these results suggest that male D. melanogaster use different sensory cues to progress through the courtship sequence: visual cues are dominant when deciding whether to approach an object whereas chemosensory cues determine how long the male pursues its target.",2014,"Sweta Agrawal, Steve Safarik, Michael Dickinson, Sweta Agrawal, Steve Safarik, Michael Dickinson"
Growth inhibition and differences in protein profiles in azadirachtin-treated Drosophila melanogaster larvae,24458307,10.1002/elps.201300318,"Azadirachtin A is a very effective biopesticide widely used in insect pest control.

Twenty-one spots with different intensity in azadirachtin-treated larvae were identified. These proteins are involved in cytoskeletal organization, transcription and translation, hormonal regulation, and energy metabolism.

Using Drosophila melanogaster to identify chemotherapy toxicity genes,25236447,10.1534/genetics.114.161968,"The severity of the toxic side effects of chemotherapy shows a great deal of interindividual variability, and much of this variation is likely genetically based. Simple DNA tests predictive of toxic side effects could revolutionize the way chemotherapy is carried out. Due to the challenges in identifying polymorphisms that affect toxicity in humans, we use Drosophila fecundity following oral exposure to carboplatin, gemcitabine and mitomycin C as a model system to identify naturally occurring DNA variants predictive of toxicity. We use the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR), a panel of recombinant inbred lines derived from a multiparent advanced intercross, to map quantitative trait loci affecting chemotoxicity. We identify two QTL each for carboplatin and gemcitabine toxicity and none for mitomycin. One QTL is associated with fly orthologs of a priori human carboplatin candidate genes ABCC2 and MSH2, and a second QTL is associated with fly orthologs of human gemcitabine candidate genes RRM2 and RRM2B. The third, a carboplatin QTL, is associated with a posteriori human orthologs from solute carrier family 7A, INPP4A&B, and NALCN. The fourth, a gemcitabine QTL that also affects methotrexate toxicity, is associated with human ortholog GPx4. Mapped QTL each explain a significant fraction of variation in toxicity, yet individual SNPs and transposable elements in the candidate gene regions fail to singly explain QTL peaks. Furthermore, estimates of founder haplotype effects are consistent with genes harboring several segregating functional alleles. We find little evidence for nonsynonymous SNPs explaining mapped QTL; thus it seems likely that standing variation in toxicity is due to regulatory alleles.",2014,"Elizabeth G King, Galina Kislukhin, Kelli N Walters, Anthony D Long, Elizabeth G King, Galina Kislukhin, Kelli N Walters, Anthony D Long"
Drosophila linker histone H1 coordinates STAT-dependent organization of heterochromatin and suppresses tumorigenesis caused by hyperactive JAK-STAT signaling,25177369,10.1186/1756-8935-7-16,"Background:
      
    

    
      Within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, chromatin is organized into compact, silent regions called heterochromatin and more loosely packaged regions of euchromatin where transcription is more active. Although the existence of heterochromatin has been known for many years, the cellular factors responsible for its formation have only recently been identified. Two key factors involved in heterochromatin formation in Drosophila are the H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase Su(var)3-9 and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). The linker histone H1 also plays a major role in heterochromatin formation in Drosophila by interacting with Su(var)3-9 and helping to recruit it to heterochromatin. Drosophila STAT (Signal transducer and activator of transcription) (STAT92E) has also been shown to be involved in the maintenance of heterochromatin, but its relationship to the H1-Su(var)3-9 heterochromatin pathway is unknown. STAT92E is also involved in tumor formation in flies. Hyperactive Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT signaling due to a mutation in Drosophila JAK (Hopscotch) causes hematopoietic tumors.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We show here that STAT92E is a second partner of H1 in the regulation of heterochromatin structure. H1 physically interacts with STAT92E and regulates its ectopic localization in the chromatin. Mis-localization of STAT92E due to its hyperphosphorylation or H1 depletion disrupts heterochromatin integrity. The contribution of the H1-STAT pathway to heterochromatin formation is mechanistically distinct from that of H1 and Su(var)3-9. The recruitment of STAT92E to chromatin by H1 also plays an important regulatory role in JAK-STAT induced tumors in flies. Depleting the linker histone H1 in flies carrying the oncogenic hopscotch (Tum-l) allele enhances tumorigenesis, and H1 overexpression suppresses tumorigenesis.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our results suggest the existence of two independent pathways for heterochromatin formation in Drosophila, one involving Su(var)3-9 and HP1 and the other involving STAT92E and HP1. The H1 linker histone directs both pathways through physical interactions with Su(var)3-9 and STAT92E, as well with HP1. The physical interaction of H1 and STAT92E confers a regulatory role on H1 in JAK-STAT signaling. H1 serves as a molecular reservoir for STAT92E in chromatin, enabling H1 to act as a tumor suppressor and oppose an oncogenic mutation in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.",2014,"Na Xu, Alexander V Emelyanov, Dmitry V Fyodorov, Arthur I Skoultchi, Na Xu, Alexander V Emelyanov, Dmitry V Fyodorov, Arthur I Skoultchi"

Behavioral synchronization to VS cycles required a functional clock and functional chordotonal organs and was accompanied by phase-shifts of the daily oscillations of PERIOD protein concentrations in brain clock neurons.

[Transcription factor comr acts as a direct activator in the genetic program controlling spermatogenesis in D. melanogaster],25842836,,"Cardiff University, Cardiff CF10 3AX, UK). In Drosophila melanogaster differentiation of the male germ cells is accompanied by chromatin rearrangement and activation of the specific genes. These processes are regulated by few transcription factors that belong to two classes, can and aly that form distinct functional complexes. Mechanisms of action of aly and can class transcription factors on gene expression and chromatin state remain unclear. To investigate this question we have built the whole genome binding profile of transcription factor Comr belonging to aly class using the tissue-specific DamID method. Resulting datawere correlated with gene expression in comr (aly class) and can (can class) mutant testes. It was shown that Comr is a direct activator for about 300 testis-specific genes. Furthermore a set of genes revealed decreased expression in comr mutants but did not bind Comr protein, suggesting the existence of secondary regulation. Indeed, among the Comr gene targets we found a gene coding an uncharacterized transcription factor that could be a secondary participant in the genetic pathway in spermatocytes.

A gain-of-function screen to identify genes that reduce lifespan in the adult of Drosophila melanogaster,24739137,10.1186/1471-2156-15-46,"Background:
      
    

    
      Several lines of evidence associate misregulated genetic expression with risk factors for diabetes, Alzheimer's, and other diseases that sporadically develop in healthy adults with no background of hereditary disorders. Thus, we are interested in genes that may be expressed normally through parts of an individual's life, but can cause physiological defects and disease when misexpressed in adulthood.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We attempted to identify these genes in a model organism by arbitrarily misexpressing specific genes in adult Drosophila melanogaster, using 14,133 Gene Search lines. We identified 39 ""reduced-lifespan genes"" that, when misexpressed in adulthood, shortened the flies' lifespan to less than 30% of that of control flies. About half of these genes have human orthologs that are known to be involved in human diseases. For about one-fourth of the reduced-lifespan genes, suppressing apoptosis restored the lifespan shortened by their misexpression. We determined the organs responsible for reduced lifespan when these genes were misexpressed specifically in adulthood, and found that while some genes induced reduced lifespan only when misexpressed in specific adult organs, others could induce reduced lifespan when misexpressed in various organs. This finding suggests that tissue-specific dysfunction may be involved in reduced lifespan related to gene misexpression. Gene ontology analysis showed that reduced-lifespan genes are biased toward genes related to development.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We identified 39 genes that, when misexpressed in adulthood, shortened the lifespan of adult flies.

We studied the role of MBONs in several associative learning tasks and in sleep regulation, revealing the extent to which information flow is segregated into distinct channels and suggesting possible roles for the multi-layered MBON network. We also show that optogenetic activation of MBONs can, depending on cell type, induce repulsion or attraction in flies. The behavioral effects of MBON perturbation are combinatorial, suggesting that the MBON ensemble collectively represents valence.

Does positive selection drive transcription factor binding site turnover? A test with Drosophila cis-regulatory modules,21572512,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002053,"Transcription factor binding site(s) (TFBS) gain and loss (i.e., turnover) is a well-documented feature of cis-regulatory module (CRM) evolution, yet little attention has been paid to the evolutionary force(s) driving this turnover process. The predominant view, motivated by its widespread occurrence, emphasizes the importance of compensatory mutation and genetic drift. Positive selection, in contrast, although it has been invoked in specific instances of adaptive gene expression evolution, has not been considered as a general alternative to neutral compensatory evolution. In this study we evaluate the two hypotheses by analyzing patterns of single nucleotide polymorphism in the TFBS of well-characterized CRM in two closely related Drosophila species, Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans. An important feature of the analysis is classification of TFBS mutations according to the direction of their predicted effect on binding affinity, which allows gains and losses to be evaluated independently along the two phylogenetic lineages. The observed patterns of polymorphism and divergence are not compatible with neutral evolution for either class of mutations. Instead, multiple lines of evidence are consistent with contributions of positive selection to TFBS gain and loss as well as purifying selection in its maintenance. In discussion, we propose a model to reconcile the finding of selection driving TFBS turnover with constrained CRM function over long evolutionary time.",2011,"Bin Z He, Alisha K Holloway, Sebastian J Maerkl, Martin Kreitman, Bin Z He, Alisha K Holloway, Sebastian J Maerkl, Martin Kreitman"

In Drosophila melanogaster, telomere length and stability are maintained through the retrotransposition of specialized telomeric sequences and by the specific loading of protecting capping proteins, respectively. Here, we show that the loss of the essential and evolutionarily conserved histone deacetylase Rpd3, the homolog of mammalian HDAC1, causes aberrant telomeric fusions on polytene chromosome ends. Remarkably, these telomere fusion defects are associated with a marked decrease of histone H4 acetylation, as well as an accumulation of heterochromatic epigenetic marks at telomeres, including histone H3K9 trimethylation and the heterochromatic protein HP2.

Attention in Drosophila,21906536,10.1016/B978-0-12-387003-2.00003-3,"As bluntly summarized by a psychologist over a century ago, everyone knows what attention is [James (1890). The Principles of Psychology]. Attention describes our capacity to focus perception on one or a group of related stimuli while filtering out irrelevant stimuli. The ease we have in recognizing this astounding capacity in ourselves is matched by a surprising difficulty in identifying it in others, and this is especially the case for measuring attention in other animals. Identifying and measuring attention-like processes in simple animals such as flies requires, to some extent, even more rigor than asking the same question for our closer animal relatives, such as apes and monkeys. This is because flies have completely different brains than humans do, so to study attention in these creatures one must rely purely on operational or behavioral measures rather than comparative neuroanatomy. There is a long history of using sophisticated behavioral paradigms to study visual responses in Drosophila melanogaster, and these studies have often provided early evidence of attention-like processes in flies. More recently, these fly paradigms have been applied to measuring visual attention directly, and the combination of electrophysiology with these preparations has provided insight into how a fly might pay attention. Together with more efficient methods for measuring some aspects of attention, such as stimulus suppression, these approaches should begin to uncover how visual attention might work in a small brain.",2011,"Bruno van Swinderen, Bruno van Swinderen"

However, we report in this paper that loss of TSC in the adult Drosophila midgut results in the formation of much larger ISCs that have halted cell division. These mutant ISCs expressed proper stem cell markers, did not differentiate, and had defects in multiple steps of the cell cycle. Slowing the growth by feeding rapamycin or reducing Myc was sufficient to rescue the division defect.

Nonclassical regulation of transcription: interchromosomal interactions at the malic enzyme locus of Drosophila melanogaster,21900270,10.1534/genetics.111.133231,"Regulation of transcription can be a complex process in which many cis- and trans-interactions determine the final pattern of expression.

Here we describe a novel case of trans-interaction between alleles of the Malic enzyme (Men) locus in Drosophila melanogaster that results in allele-specific, non-additive gene expression. Using both empirical biochemical and predictive bioinformatic approaches, we show that the regulatory elements of one allele are capable of interacting in trans with, and modifying the expression of, the second allele. Furthermore, we show that nonlocal factors--different genetic backgrounds--are capable of significant interactions with individual Men alleles, suggesting that these trans-effects can be modified by both locally and distantly acting elements.

Histaminergic signaling in the central nervous system of Daphnia and a role for it in the control of phototactic behavior,21525325,10.1242/jeb.054486,"Daphnia magna and Daphnia pulex are well-established model organisms in the fields of ecotoxicology and toxicogenomics. Among the many assays used for determining the effects of environmental and anthropogenic stressors on these animals is monitoring for changes in their phototactic behavior. In most arthropods, histamine has been shown to play a key role in the visual system. Currently, nothing is known about histaminergic signaling in either D. magna or D. pulex. Here, a combination of immunohistochemistry and genome mining was used to identify and characterize the histaminergic systems in these daphnids. In addition, a behavioral assay was used to assess the role of histamine in their phototactic response to ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. An extensive network of histaminergic somata, axons and neuropil was identified via immunohistochemistry within the central nervous system of both daphnids, including labeling of putative photoreceptors in the compound eye and projections from these cells to the brain. Mining of the D. pulex genome using known Drosophila melanogaster proteins identified a putative ortholog of histidine decarboxylase (the rate-limiting biosynthetic enzyme for histamine), as well as two putative histamine-gated chloride channels (hclA and hclB orthologs). Exposure of D. magna to cimetidine, an H2 receptor antagonist known to block both hclA and hclB in D. melanogaster, inhibited their negative phototactic response to UV exposure in a reversible, time-dependent manner. Taken collectively, our results show that an extensive histaminergic system is present in Daphnia species, including the visual system, and that this amine is involved in the control of phototaxis in these animals.",2011,"Matthew D McCoole, Kevin N Baer, Andrew E Christie, Matthew D McCoole, Kevin N Baer, Andrew E Christie"
Sperm of the wasted mutant are wasted when females utilize the stored sperm in Drosophila melanogaster,21670549,10.1266/ggs.86.97,"Females of many animal species store sperm after copulation for use in fertilization, but the mechanisms controlling sperm storage and utilization are largely unknown. Here we describe a novel male sterile mutation of Drosophila melanogaster, wasted (wst), which shows defects in various processes of sperm utilization. The sperm of wst mutant males are stored like those of wild-type males in the female sperm storage organs, the spermathecae and seminal receptacles, after copulation and are released at each ovulation. However, an average of thirteen times more wst sperm than wild type sperm are released at each ovulation, resulting in rapid loss of sperm stored in seminal receptacles within a few days after copulation. wst sperm can enter eggs efficiently at 5 hr after copulation, but the efficiency of sperm entry decreases significantly by 24 hr after copulation, suggesting that wst sperm lose their ability to enter eggs during storage. Furthermore, wst sperm fail to undergo nuclear decondensation, which prevents the process of fertilization even when sperm enter eggs. Our results indicate that the wst gene is essential for independent processes in the utilization of stored sperm; namely, regulation of sperm release from female storage organs, maintenance of sperm efficiency for entry into eggs, and formation of the male pronucleus in the egg at fertilization.",2011,"Takashi Ohsako, Masa-Toshi Yamamoto, Takashi Ohsako, Masa-Toshi Yamamoto"
Evolutionary genomics of Glossina morsitans immune-related CLIP domain serine proteases and serine protease inhibitors,21055483,10.1016/j.meegid.2010.10.006,"Several species of haematophagous tsetse flies (genus Glossina) are vectors for trypanosomes, the parasitic protozoans that cause Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT). Although there was a reduced incidence of HAT in the mid 1960s, decreased disease surveillance has led to a resurgence of HAT in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite being efficient vectors for HAT transmission, the prevalence of G. morsitans infection by trypanosomes in the wild is surprisingly minimal. The precise mechanisms by which G. morsitans remain refractory to trypanosome infection are largely unknown although it has been demonstrated that G. morsitans mounts a strong immune response to invading pathogens. This study identifies G. morsitans immune-related CLIP domain serine proteases and their inhibitors, serine protease inhibitors (serpin) genes. It further establishes their evolutionary relationships with counterparts in Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Bombyx mori, Manduca sexta and Culex quinquefasciatus. Multiple sequence alignments show conservation of most secondary structure elements for both CLIPs and serpins. Amino acid composition of the serpin reactive site loop (RSL) indicates that the G. morsitans serpins act through an inhibitory mechanism to the target serine protease. Similar to D. melanogaster and unlike A. gambiae, the transcriptome data suggest that G. morsitans does not contain gene expansions in their CLIP-domain serine protease and serpin families. The presence of alternatively spliced variants in the G. morsitans serpins transcriptome data mirrors that of the D. melanogaster transcriptome.",2011,"Sarah Mwangi, Edwin Murungi, Mario Jonas, Alan Christoffels, Sarah Mwangi, Edwin Murungi, Mario Jonas, Alan Christoffels"
Reconstruction and crosstalk of protein-protein interaction networks of Wnt and Hedgehog signaling in Drosophila melanogaster,22000799,10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2011.07.002,"In the last few years, researchers have an intense interest in the evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways which have crucial roles during embryonic development. The most intriguing factor of this interest is that malfunctioning of these signaling pathways (Hedgehog, Notch, Wnt etc.) leads to several human diseases, especially to cancer. This study deals with the Î²-catenin dependent branch of Wnt signaling and the Hedgehog signaling pathways which offer potential targeting points for cancer drug development. The identification of all proteins functioning in these signaling networks is crucial for the efforts of preventing tumor formation. Here, through integration of protein-protein interaction data and Gene Ontology annotations, Wnt/Î²-catenin and Hedgehog signaling networks consisting of proteins that have statistically high probability of being biologically related to these signaling pathways were reconstructed in Drosophila melanogaster. Next, by the structural network analyses, the crucial components functioning in these pathways were identified. The proteins Arm, Frizzled receptors (Fz and Fz2), Arr, Apc, Axn, Ci and Ptc were detected as the key proteins in these networks. Futhermore, the hub protein Mer having tumor suppressor function may be proposed as a putative drug target for cancer and deserves further investigation via experimental methods.

Overexpression of kermit/dGIPC is associated with lethality in Drosophila melanogaster,21344130,10.1590/s0100-879x2011007500022,"Insertional mutagenesis is an important tool for functional genomics in Drosophila melanogaster. The insertion site in the KG00562 mutant fly line has been mapped to the CG8709 (herein named DmLpin) locus and to the 3' of kermit (also called dGIPC). This mutant line presents a high lethality rate resulting from a gain of function. To obtain some insight into the biological role of the mutated locus, we have characterized the mutation and its relation to the high mortality of the KG00562 fly line. In this mutant, we did not detect one of the DmLpin transcripts, namely DmLpinK, but we did detect an unusual 2.3-kb mRNA (LpinK-w). Further investigation revealed that the LpinK-w transcript results from an aberrant splicing between the untranslated first exon of DmLpinK and the mini-white marker gene. Lack of DmLpinK or LpinK-w expression does not contribute to lethality, since heterozygous KG00562/Def7860 animals presented lethality rates comparable to those of the wild type. In contrast, the overexpression of kermit was associated with lethality of the KG00562 fly line. Significantly higher levels of kermit were detected in the Malpighian tubules of KG00562/+ flies that presented higher lethality rates than wild-type or KG00562/Def7860 animals, in which the lethality was rescued.

A Drosophila model for fetal alcohol syndrome disorders: role for the insulin pathway,21303840,10.1242/dmm.006411,"Prenatal exposure to ethanol in humans results in a wide range of developmental abnormalities, including growth deficiency, developmental delay, reduced brain size, permanent neurobehavioral abnormalities and fetal death. Here we describe the use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model for exploring the effects of ethanol exposure on development and behavior. We show that developmental ethanol exposure causes reduced viability, developmental delay and reduced adult body size. We find that flies reared on ethanol-containing food have smaller brains and imaginal discs, which is due to reduced cell division rather than increased apoptosis. Additionally, we show that, as in mammals, flies reared on ethanol have altered responses to ethanol vapor exposure as adults, including increased locomotor activation, resistance to the sedating effects of the drug and reduced tolerance development upon repeated ethanol exposure. We have found that the developmental and behavioral defects are largely due to the effects of ethanol on insulin signaling; specifically, a reduction in Drosophila insulin-like peptide (Dilp) and insulin receptor expression. Transgenic expression of Dilp proteins in the larval brain suppressed both the developmental and behavioral abnormalities displayed by ethanol-reared adult flies. Our results thus establish Drosophila as a useful model system to uncover the complex etiology of fetal alcohol syndrome.",2011,"Kimberly D McClure, Rachael L French, Ulrike Heberlein, Kimberly D McClure, Rachael L French, Ulrike Heberlein"

To shed light on this issue, we characterized the wild-type expression patterns and activity of EcR/USP in individual tissues during early adult life. EcR and usp were expressed in numerous adult tissues, but receptor activity varied depending on tissue type and adult age. Receptor activity did not detectably change in response to mating status, environmental stress, ecdysone treatment or gender but is reduced when a constitutively inactive ecdysone receptor is present.

A remarkably stable TipE gene cluster: evolution of insect Para sodium channel auxiliary subunits,22098672,10.1186/1471-2148-11-337,"Background:
      
    

    
      First identified in fruit flies with temperature-sensitive paralysis phenotypes, the Drosophila melanogaster TipE locus encodes four voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channel auxiliary subunits. This cluster of TipE-like genes on chromosome 3L, and a fifth family member on chromosome 3R, are important for the optional expression and functionality of the Para NaV channel but appear quite distinct from auxiliary subunits in vertebrates. Here, we exploited available arthropod genomic resources to trace the origin of TipE-like genes by mapping their evolutionary histories and examining their genomic architectures.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We identified a remarkably conserved synteny block of TipE-like orthologues with well-maintained local gene arrangements from 21 insect species. Homologues in the water flea, Daphnia pulex, suggest an ancestral pancrustacean repertoire of four TipE-like genes; a subsequent gene duplication may have generated functional redundancy allowing gene losses in the silk moth and mosquitoes. Intronic nesting of the insect TipE gene cluster probably occurred following the divergence from crustaceans, but in the flour beetle and silk moth genomes the clusters apparently escaped from nesting. Across Pancrustacea, TipE gene family members have experienced intronic nesting, escape from nesting, retrotransposition, translocation, and gene loss events while generally maintaining their local gene neighbourhoods. D. melanogaster TipE-like genes exhibit coordinated spatial and temporal regulation of expression distinct from their host gene but well-correlated with their regulatory target, the Para NaV channel, suggesting that functional constraints may preserve the TipE gene cluster. We identified homology between TipE-like NaV channel regulators and vertebrate Slo-beta auxiliary subunits of big-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) channels, which suggests that ion channel regulatory partners have evolved distinct lineage-specific characteristics.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      TipE-like genes form a remarkably conserved genomic cluster across all examined insect genomes.

Genotoxic effects of two nickel-compounds in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,21073980,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2010.10.008,"In view of the scarcely available information on the in vivo mutagenic and co-mutagenic activity of nickel, the genotoxic potential of two nickel-compounds, nickel chloride (NiCl(2)) and nickel sulphate (NiSO(4)), was assessed in Drosophila melanogaster by measuring two different genetic endpoints. On the one hand, we used the wing-spot assay, which is based on the principle that the loss of heterozygosity of two suitable recessive markers, multiple wing hairs (mwh) and flare-3 (flr(3)), can lead to the formation of mutant clones in the imaginal disks of larval cells. On the other hand, the in vivo comet assay, which detects single- and double-strand DNA breaks, was also used with larval haemocytes. These cells offer several advantages: they are highly sensitive to genotoxic agents, the sampling and processing methodologies are quite simple and the level of basal DNA damage is relatively low. No significant increases in the frequencies of the three categories of mutant spots (i.e. small single spots, large single spots, and twin spots) were observed in the wing-spot assay; however, NiSO(4) induced significant dose-dependent increases in DNA damage in the comet assay. In addition, the combined treatments with gamma-radiation and NiCl(2) and NiSO(4) showed a slight but significant increase in the frequency of the three categories of mutant spots compared with the frequency induced by gamma-radiation alone, indicating that both nickel compounds have a synergistic interaction. These results support the assumption that both nickel compounds could act as co-mutagens interfering with DNA-repair processes and that the in vivo comet assay is a sensitive and effective method for detecting the DNA damage induced by NiSO(4) in haemocytes of D. melanogaster.",2011,"Erico R Carmona, Amadeu Creus, R Marcos, Erico R Carmona, Amadeu Creus, R Marcos"
Beyond molting--roles of the steroid molting hormone ecdysone in regulation of memory and sleep in adult Drosophila,21444997,10.4161/fly.5.3.15477,"The molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) is an active metabolite of ecdysone and plays vital roles during ontogeny of the fruit fly Drosophila, coordinating critical developmental transitions such as molting and metamorphosis. Although 20E is known to exist throughout life in both male and female flies, its functions in adult physiology and behavior remain largely elusive. Notably, findings from previous studies suggest that this hormone may be involved in adult stress responses. Consistent with this possibility, we have found that ecdysone signaling in adult flies is activated by ""stressful"" social interactions and plays a role in the formation of long-term courtship memory [Ishimoto et al. (2009). Ecdysone signaling regulates the formation of long-term courtship memory in adult Drosophila melanogaster. PNAS 106, 6381-6386]. In addition, we recently reported that ecdysone signaling contributes to the regulation of sleep, affecting transitions between sleep and wakefulness [Ishimoto and Kitamoto. (2010).

Here in Extra Views, we first summarize our findings on the unconventional roles of 20E in regulating memory and sleep in adult flies.

Wiring economy and volume exclusion determine neuronal placement in the Drosophila brain,22119527,10.1016/j.cub.2011.10.022,"Wiring economy has successfully explained the individual placement of neurons in simple nervous systems like that of Caenorhabditis elegans [1-3] and the locations of coarser structures like cortical areas in complex vertebrate brains [4]. However, it remains unclear whether wiring economy can explain the placement of individual neurons in brains larger than that of C. elegans. Indeed, given the greater number of neuronal interconnections in larger brains, simply minimizing the length of connections results in unrealistic configurations, with multiple neurons occupying the same position in space. Avoiding such configurations, or volume exclusion, repels neurons from each other, thus counteracting wiring economy. Here we test whether wiring economy together with volume exclusion can explain the placement of neurons in a module of the Drosophila melanogaster brain known as lamina cartridge [5-13]. We used newly developed techniques for semiautomated reconstruction from serial electron microscopy (EM) [14] to obtain the shapes of neurons, the location of synapses, and the resultant synaptic connectivity. We show that wiring length minimization and volume exclusion together can explain the structure of the lamina microcircuit. Therefore, even in brains larger than that of C. elegans, at least for some circuits, optimization can play an important role in individual neuron placement.",2011,"Marta Rivera-Alba, Shiv N Vitaladevuni, Yuriy Mishchenko, Zhiyuan Lu, Shin-Ya Takemura, Lou Scheffer, Ian A Meinertzhagen, Dmitri B Chklovskii, Gonzalo G de Polavieja, Marta Rivera-Alba, Shiv N Vitaladevuni, Yuriy Mishchenko, Zhiyuan Lu, Shin-Ya Takemura, Lou Scheffer, Ian A Meinertzhagen, Dmitri B Chklovskii, Gonzalo G de Polavieja"

A subset of Drosophila integrator proteins is essential for efficient U7 snRNA and spliceosomal snRNA 3'-end formation,21078872,10.1128/MCB.00943-10,"Proper gene expression relies on a class of ubiquitously expressed, uridine-rich small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Vertebrate snRNAs are transcribed from a unique promoter, which is required for proper 3'-end formation, and cleavage of the nascent transcript involves the activity of a poorly understood set of proteins called the Integrator complex. To examine 3'-end formation in Drosophila melanogaster, we developed a cell-based reporter that monitors aberrant 3'-end formation of snRNA through the gain in expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). We used this reporter in Drosophila S2 cells to determine requirements for U7 snRNA 3'-end formation and found that processing was strongly dependent upon nucleotides located within the 3' stem-loop as well as sequences likely to comprise the Drosophila equivalent of the vertebrate 3' box. Substitution of the actin promoter for the snRNA promoter abolished proper 3'-end formation, demonstrating the conserved requirement for an snRNA promoter in Drosophila. We tested the requirement for all Drosophila Integrator subunits and found that Integrators 1, 4, 9, and 11 were essential for 3'-end formation and that Integrators 3 and 10 may be dispensable for processing. Depletion of cleavage and polyadenylation factors or of histone pre-mRNA processing factors did not affect U7 snRNA processing efficiency, demonstrating that the Integrator complex does not share components with the mRNA 3'-end processing machinery.

Functional conservation of clock output signaling between flies and intertidal crabs,22215610,10.1177/0748730411420242,"Intertidal species have both circadian and circatidal clocks. Although the behavioral evidence for these oscillators is more than 5 decades old, virtually nothing is known about their molecular clockwork. Pigment-dispersing hormones (PDHs) were originally described in crustaceans. Their insect homologs, pigment-dispersing factors (PDFs), have a prominent role as clock output and synchronizing signals released from clock neurons. We show that gene duplication in crabs has led to two PDH genes (Î²-pdh-I and Î²-pdh-II). Phylogenetically, Î²-pdh-I is more closely related to insect pdf than to Î²-pdh-II, and we hypothesized that Î²-PDH-I may represent a canonical clock output signal. Accordingly, Î²-PDH-I expression in the brain of the intertidal crab Cancer productus is similar to that of PDF in Drosophila melanogaster, and neurons that express PDH-I also show CYCLE-like immunoreactivity. Using D. melanogaster pdf-null mutants (pdf(01)) as a heterologous system, we show that Î²-pdh-I is indistinguishable from pdf in its ability to rescue the mutant arrhythmic phenotype, but Î²-pdh-II fails to restore the wild-type phenotype. Application of the three peptides to explanted brains shows that PDF and Î²-PDH-I are equally effective in inducing the signal transduction cascade of the PDF receptor, but Î²-PDH-II fails to induce a normal cascade.

Artificial selection on egg size perturbs early pattern formation in Drosophila melanogaster,20636356,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01088.x,"Pattern formation in Drosophila embryogenesis has been widely investigated as a developmental and evolutionary model of robustness. To ask whether genetic variation for pattern formation is suppressed in this system, artificial selection for divergent egg size was used to challenge the scaling of even-skipped (eve) pattern formation in mitotic cycle 14 (stage 5) embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. Three-dimensional confocal imaging revealed shifts in the allometry of eve pair-rule stripes along both anterior?posterior (A?P) and dorsoventral (D?V) axes as a correlated response to egg size selection, indicating the availability of genetic variation for this buffered trait. Environmental perturbation was not required for the manifestation of this variation. The number of nuclei at the cellular blastoderm stage also changed in response to selection, with large-egg selected lines having more than 1000 additional nuclei relative to small-egg lines. This increase in nuclear number in larger eggs does not scale with egg size, however, as nuclear density is inversely correlated with egg length. Nuclear density varies along the A?P axis but does not correlate with the shift in eve stripe allometry between the selection treatments.

Complex interplay of evolutionary forces in the ladybird homeobox genes of Drosophila melanogaster,21799919,10.1371/journal.pone.0022613,"Tandemly arranged paralogous genes lbe and lbl are members of the Drosophila NK homeobox family. We analyzed population samples of Drosophila melanogaster from Africa, Europe, North and South America, and single strains of D. sechellia, D. simulans, and D. yakuba within two linked regions encompassing partial sequences of lbe and lbl. The evolution of lbe and lbl is highly constrained due to their important regulatory functions. Despite this, a variety of forces have shaped the patterns of variation in lb genes: recombination, intragenic gene conversion and natural selection strongly influence background variation created by linkage disequilibrium and dimorphic haplotype structure. The two genes exhibited similar levels of nucleotide diversity and positive selection was detected in the noncoding regions of both genes. However, synonymous variability was significantly higher for lbe: no nonsynonymous changes were observed in this gene. We argue that balancing selection impacts some synonymous sites of the lbe gene. Stability of mRNA secondary structure was significantly different between the lbe (but not lbl) haplotype groups and may represent a driving force of balancing selection in epistatically interacting synonymous sites. Balancing selection on synonymous sites may be the first, or one of a few such observations, in Drosophila. In contrast, recurrent positive selection on lbl at the protein level influenced evolution at three codon sites. Transcription factor binding-site profiles were different for lbe and lbl, suggesting that their developmental functions are not redundant. Combined with our previous results on nucleotide variation in esterase and other homeobox genes, these results suggest that interplay of balancing and directional selection may be a general feature of molecular evolution in Drosophila and other eukaryote genomes.",2011,"Evgeniy S Balakirev, Maria Anisimova, Francisco J Ayala, Evgeniy S Balakirev, Maria Anisimova, Francisco J Ayala"
Identification of a classical bipartite nuclear localization signal in the Drosophila TEA/ATTS protein scalloped,21731746,10.1371/journal.pone.0021431,"Drosophila melanogaster wing development has been shown to rely on the activity of a complex of two proteins, Scalloped (Sd) and Vestigial (Vg).

There is also evidence that Sd is required for the nuclear translocation of Vg. Indeed, a candidate sequence which shows consensus to the bipartite family of nuclear localization signals (NLSs) has been identified within Sd previously, though it is not known if it is functional, or if additional unpredicted signals that mediate nuclear transport exist within the protein. By expressing various enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) tagged constructs within Drosophila S2 cells, we demonstrate that this NLS is indeed functional and necessary for the proper nuclear localization of Sd. Additionally, the region containing the NLS is critical for the wildtype function of ectopically expressed Sd, in the context of wing development. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified a group of five amino acids within this NLS which is critical for its function, as well as another group of two which is of lesser importance. Together with data that suggests that this sequence mediates interactions with Importin-Î±3, we conclude that the identified NLS is likely a classical bipartite signal. Further dissection of Sd has also revealed that a large portion of the C-terminal domain of the protein is required its proper nuclear localization. Finally, a Leptomycin B (LB) sensitive signal which appears to facilitate nuclear export is identified, raising the possibility that Sd also contains a nuclear export signal (NES).",2011,"Adam C Magico, John B Bell, Adam C Magico, John B Bell"
Loss of the extraproteasomal ubiquitin receptor Rings lost impairs ring canal growth in Drosophila oogenesis,21444692,10.1083/jcb.201009142,"In Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis, there are 16 germline cells that form a cyst and stay connected to each other by ring canals. Ring canals allow the cytoplasmic transport of proteins, messenger ribonucleic acids, and yolk components from the nurse cells into the oocyte. In this paper, we describe the protein Rings lost (Rngo) and show that it is required for ring canal growth in germline cysts. rngo is an essential gene, and germline clones of a rngo-null allele show defects in ovary development, including mislocalization of ring canal proteins and fusion of germline cells. Rngo appears to be a ubiquitin receptor that possesses a ubiquitin-like domain, a ubiquitin-associated domain, and a retroviral-like aspartate protease (RVP) domain. Rngo binds to ubiquitin and to the 26S proteasome and colocalizes with both in germline cells, and its RVP domain is required for dimerization of Rngo and for its function in vivo. Our results thus show, for the first time, a function for a ubiquitin receptor in Drosophila development.",2011,"Tobias Morawe, Mona Honemann-Capito, Walter von Stein, Andreas Wodarz, Tobias Morawe, Mona Honemann-Capito, Walter von Stein, Andreas Wodarz"
MicroRNA evolution by arm switching,21212805,10.1038/embor.2010.191,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate transcript stability and translation. Functional mature miRNAs are processed from one or both arms of the hairpin precursor. The miR-100/10 family has undergone three independent evolutionary events that have switched the arm from which the functional miRNA is processed. The dominant miR-10 sequences in the insects Drosophila melanogaster and Tribolium castaneum are processed from opposite arms. However, the duplex produced by Dicer cleavage has an identical sequence in fly and beetle. Expression of the Tribolium miR-10 sequence in Drosophila S2 cells recapitulates the native beetle pattern. Thus, arm usage is encoded in the primary miRNA sequence, but outside the mature miRNA duplex. We show that the predicted messenger RNA targets and inferred function of sequences from opposite arms differ significantly. Arm switching is likely to be general, and provides a fundamental mechanism to evolve the function of a miRNA locus and target gene network.",2011,"Sam Griffiths-Jones, Jerome H L Hui, Antonio Marco, Matthew Ronshaugen, Sam Griffiths-Jones, Jerome H L Hui, Antonio Marco, Matthew Ronshaugen"

We report here a meta-analysis of short RNA data from Drosophila melanogaster, aggregating published libraries with 76 data sets that we generated for the modENCODE project. In total, we began with more than 1 billion raw reads from 187 libraries comprising diverse developmental stages, specific tissue- and cell-types, mutant conditions, and/or Argonaute immunoprecipitations. We elucidated several features of known miRNA loci, including multiple phased byproducts of cropping and dicing, abundant alternative 5' termini of certain miRNAs, frequent 3' untemplated additions, and potential editing events. We also identified 49 novel genomic locations of miRNA production, and 61 additional candidate loci with limited evidence for miRNA biogenesis. Although these loci broaden the Drosophila miRNA catalog, this work supports the notion that a restricted set of cellular transcripts is competent to be specifically processed by the Drosha/Dicer-1 pathway. Unexpectedly, we detected miRNA production from coding and untranslated regions of mRNAs and found the phenomenon of miRNA production from the antisense strand of known loci to be common.

Slow inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster express as much inbreeding depression as fast inbred lines under semi-natural conditions,21416261,10.1007/s10709-011-9563-3,"Selection may reduce the deleterious consequences of inbreeding. This may be due to purging of recessive deleterious alleles or balancing selection favouring heterozygote offspring. Such selection is expected to be more efficient at slower compared to at faster rates of inbreeding. In this study we tested the impact of inbreeding and the rate of inbreeding on fitness related traits (egg productivity, egg-to-adult viability, developmental time and behaviour) under cold and benign semi-natural thermal conditions using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. We used non-inbred control and slow and fast inbred lines (both with an expected inbreeding level of 0.25). The results show that contrary to expectations the slow inbred lines do not maintain higher average fitness than the fast inbred lines. Furthermore, we found that stressful environmental conditions increased the level of inbreeding depression but the impact of inbreeding rate on the level of inbreeding depression was not affected by the environmental conditions. The results do not support the hypothesis that inbreeding depression is less severe with slow compared to fast rates of inbreeding and illustrate that although selection may be more efficient with slower rates of inbreeding this does not necessary lead to less inbreeding depression.",2011,"Torsten Nygaard Kristensen, Morten Ravn Knudsen, Volker Loeschcke, Torsten Nygaard Kristensen, Morten Ravn Knudsen, Volker Loeschcke"
Socially-responsive gene expression in male Drosophila melanogaster is influenced by the sex of the interacting partner,20980240,10.1534/genetics.110.122754,"Behavior is influenced by an organism's genes and environment, including its interactions with same or opposite sex individuals. Drosophila melanogaster perform innate, yet socially modifiable, courtship behaviors that are sex specific and require rapid integration and response to multiple sensory cues. Furthermore, males must recognize and distinguish other males from female courtship objects. It is likely that perception, integration, and response to sex-specific cues is partially mediated by changes in gene expression. Reasoning that social interactions with members of either sex would impact gene expression, we compared expression profiles in heads of males that courted females, males that interacted with other males, or males that did not interact with another fly. Expression of 281 loci changes when males interact with females, whereas 505 changes occur in response to male-male interactions. Of these genes, 265 are responsive to encounters with either sex and 240 respond specifically to male-male interactions. Interestingly, 16 genes change expression only when a male courts a female, suggesting that these changes are a specific response to male-female courtship interactions. We supported our hypothesis that socially-responsive genes can function in behavior by showing that egghead (egh) expression, which increases during social interactions, is required for robust male-to-female courtship. We predict that analyzing additional socially-responsive genes will give us insight into genes and neural signaling pathways that influence reproductive and other behavioral interactions.",2011,"Lisa L Ellis, Ginger E Carney, Lisa L Ellis, Ginger E Carney"
The GATOR1 Complex Regulates Metabolic Homeostasis and the Response to Nutrient Stress in Drosophila melanogaster,27672113,10.1534/g3.116.035337,"TORC1 regulates metabolism and growth in response to a large array of upstream inputs. The evolutionarily conserved trimeric GATOR1 complex inhibits TORC1 activity in response to amino acid limitation. In humans, the GATOR1 complex has been implicated in a wide array of pathologies including cancer and hereditary forms of epilepsy. However, the precise role of GATOR1 in animal physiology remains largely undefined. Here, we characterize null mutants of the GATOR1 components nprl2, nprl3, and iml1 in Drosophila melanogaster We demonstrate that all three mutants have inappropriately high baseline levels of TORC1 activity and decreased adult viability. Consistent with increased TORC1 activity, GATOR1 mutants exhibit a cell autonomous increase in cell growth. Notably, escaper nprl2 and nprl3 mutant adults have a profound locomotion defect. In line with a nonautonomous role in the regulation of systemic metabolism, expressing the Nprl3 protein in the fat body, a nutrient storage organ, and hemocytes but not muscles and neurons rescues the motility of nprl3 mutants. Finally, we show that nprl2 and nprl3 mutants fail to activate autophagy in response to amino acid limitation and are extremely sensitive to both amino acid and complete starvation. Thus, in Drosophila, in addition to maintaining baseline levels of TORC1 activity, the GATOR1 complex has retained a critical role in the response to nutrient stress. In summary, the TORC1 inhibitor GATOR1 contributes to multiple aspects of the development and physiology of Drosophila.",2016,"Youheng Wei, Brad Reveal, Weili Cai, Mary A Lilly, Youheng Wei, Brad Reveal, Weili Cai, Mary A Lilly"
Urm1: an essential regulator of JNK signaling and oxidative stress in Drosophila melanogaster,26715182,10.1007/s00018-015-2121-x,"Ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (Urm1) is a ubiquitin-like molecule (UBL) with the dual capacity to act both as a sulphur carrier and posttranslational protein modifier. Here we characterize the Drosophila melanogaster homologues of Urm1 (CG33276) and its E1 activating enzyme Uba4 (CG13090), and show that they function together to induce protein urmylation in vivo. Urm1 conjugation to target proteins in general, and to the evolutionary conserved substrate Peroxiredoxin 5 (Prx5) specifically, is dependent on Uba4. A complete loss of Urm1 is lethal in flies, although a small number of adult zygotic Urm1 (n123) mutant escapers can be recovered. These escapers display a decreased general fitness and shortened lifespan, but in contrast to their S. cerevisiae counterparts, they are resistant to oxidative stress. Providing a molecular explanation, we demonstrate that cytoprotective JNK signaling is increased in Urm1 deficient animals. In agreement, molecular and genetic evidence suggest that elevated activity of the JNK downstream target genes Jafrac1 and gstD1 strongly contributes to the tolerance against oxidative stress displayed by Urm1 (n123) null mutants. In conclusion, Urm1 is a UBL that is involved in the regulation of JNK signaling and the response against oxidative stress in the fruit fly.",2016,"B Khoshnood, I Dacklin, C Grabbe, B Khoshnood, I Dacklin, C Grabbe"
Chronic jet lag impairs startle-induced locomotion in Drosophila,27639775,10.1016/j.exger.2016.09.012,"Endogenous circadian clocks with ~24-h periodicity are found in most organisms from cyanobacteria to humans. Daylight synchronizes these clocks to solar time. In humans, shift-work and jet lag perturb clock synchronization, and such perturbations, when repeated or chronic, are strongly suspected to be detrimental to healthspan. Here we investigated locomotor aging and longevity in Drosophila melanogaster with genetically or environmentally disrupted clocks. We compared two mutations in period (per, a gene essential for circadian rhythmicity in Drosophila), after introducing them in a common reference genetic background: the arrhythmic per01, and perT which displays robust short 16-h rhythms. Compared to the wild type, both per mutants showed reduced longevity and decreased startle-induced locomotion in aging flies, while spontaneous locomotor activity was not impaired. The per01 phenotypes were generally less severe than those of perT, suggesting that chronic jet lag is more detrimental to aging than arrhythmicity in Drosophila. Interestingly, the adjustment of environmental light-dark cycles to the endogenous rhythms of the perT mutant fully suppressed the acceleration in the age-related decline of startle-induced locomotion, while it accelerated this decline in wild-type flies. Overall, our results show that chronic jet lag accelerates a specific form of locomotor aging in Drosophila, and that this effect can be alleviated by environmental changes that ameliorate circadian rhythm synchronization.",2016,"Alexandra Vaccaro, Serge Birman, AndrÃ© Klarsfeld, Alexandra Vaccaro, Serge Birman, AndrÃ© Klarsfeld"

The absence of four genes involved in CI from this genome, together with literature reports of low frequencies of infected flies in wild populations that contain high mitogenome polymorphism, suggests that this bacterium does not induce CI in D. incompta. Phylogenomic analysis placed Wolbachia infecting D. incompta as closely related to the wMel strain which received such name since it was originally detected in Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, phylogenetic analysis using the Wolbachia surface protein gene and five genes used for multilocus sequence typing of Wolbachia found infecting Drosophila and other arthropod species of Old and New World displayed a complex evolutionary scenario involving recent horizontal transfer bursts in all major clades of Wolbachia pipens belonging to the supergroup A in both geographical regions.",2016,"G L Wallau, M T da Rosa, F C De RÃ©, E L S Loreto, G L Wallau, M T da Rosa, F C De RÃ©, E L S Loreto"
Sex Differences in Drosophila Somatic Gene Expression: Variation and Regulation by doublesex,27172187,10.1534/g3.116.027961,"Sex differences in gene expression have been widely studied in Drosophila melanogaster Sex differences vary across strains, but many molecular studies focus on only a single strain, or on genes that show sexually dimorphic expression in many strains. How extensive variability is and whether this variability occurs among genes regulated by sex determination hierarchy terminal transcription factors is unknown. To address these questions, we examine differences in sexually dimorphic gene expression between two strains in Drosophila adult head tissues. We also examine gene expression in doublesex (dsx) mutant strains to determine which sex-differentially expressed genes are regulated by DSX, and the mode by which DSX regulates expression. We find substantial variation in sex-differential expression. The sets of genes with sexually dimorphic expression in each strain show little overlap. The prevalence of different DSX regulatory modes also varies between the two strains. Neither the patterns of DSX DNA occupancy, nor mode of DSX regulation explain why some genes show consistent sex-differential expression across strains. We find that the genes identified as regulated by DSX in this study are enriched with known sites of DSX DNA occupancy. Finally, we find that sex-differentially expressed genes and genes regulated by DSX are highly enriched on the fourth chromosome. These results provide insights into a more complete pool of potential DSX targets, as well as revealing the molecular flexibility of DSX regulation.",2016,"Michelle N Arbeitman, Felicia N New, Justin M Fear, Tiffany S Howard, Justin E Dalton, Rita M Graze, Michelle N Arbeitman, Felicia N New, Justin M Fear, Tiffany S Howard, Justin E Dalton, Rita M Graze"
Lithium-Responsive Seizure-Like Hyperexcitability Is Caused by a Mutation in the Drosophila Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel Gene paralytic,27844061,10.1523/ENEURO.0221-16.2016,"Shudderer (Shu) is an X-linked dominant mutation in Drosophila melanogaster identified more than 40 years ago. A previous study showed that Shu caused spontaneous tremors and defects in reactive climbing behavior, and that these phenotypes were significantly suppressed when mutants were fed food containing lithium, a mood stabilizer used in the treatment of bipolar disorder (Williamson, 1982). This unique observation suggested that the Shu mutation affects genes involved in lithium-responsive neurobiological processes. In the present study, we identified Shu as a novel mutant allele of the voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channel gene paralytic (para). Given that hypomorphic para alleles and RNA interference-mediated para knockdown reduced the severity of Shu phenotypes, Shu was classified as a para hypermorphic allele. We also demonstrated that lithium could improve the behavioral abnormalities displayed by other Nav mutants, including a fly model of the human generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus. Our electrophysiological analysis of Shu showed that lithium treatment did not acutely suppress Nav channel activity, indicating that the rescue effect of lithium resulted from chronic physiological adjustments to this drug. Microarray analysis revealed that lithium significantly alters the expression of various genes in Shu, including those involved in innate immune responses, amino acid metabolism, and oxidation-reduction processes, raising the interesting possibility that lithium-induced modulation of these biological pathways may contribute to such adjustments. Overall, our findings demonstrate that Nav channel mutants in Drosophila are valuable genetic tools for elucidating the effects of lithium on the nervous system in the context of neurophysiology and behavior.",2016,"Garrett A Kaas, Junko Kasuya, Patrick Lansdon, Atsushi Ueda, Atulya Iyengar, Chun-Fang Wu, Toshihiro Kitamoto, Garrett A Kaas, Junko Kasuya, Patrick Lansdon, Atsushi Ueda, Atulya Iyengar, Chun-Fang Wu, Toshihiro Kitamoto"
Variation and Evolution in the Glutamine-Rich Repeat Region of Drosophila Argonaute-2,27317784,10.1534/g3.116.031880,"RNA interference pathways mediate biological processes through Argonaute-family proteins, which bind small RNAs as guides to silence complementary target nucleic acids .

Here we combine long-read amplicon sequencing of Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines with publicly available sequence data from many insect species to show that this region evolves extremely rapidly and is hyper-variable within species. We identify distinct GRR haplotype groups in Drosophila melanogaster, and suggest that one of these haplotype groups has recently risen to high frequency in a North American population. Finally, we use published data from genome-wide association studies of viral resistance in D. melanogaster to test whether GRR haplotypes are associated with survival after virus challenge.

Discrete Mesh Approach in Morphogenesis Modelling: the Example of Gastrulation,27853896,10.1007/s10441-016-9301-4,"Morphogenesis is a general concept in biology including all the processes which generate tissue shapes and cellular organizations in a living organism. Many hybrid formalizations (i.e., with both discrete and continuous parts) have been proposed for modelling morphogenesis in embryonic or adult animals, like gastrulation. We propose first to study the ventral furrow invagination as the initial step of gastrulation, early stage of embryogenesis. We focus on the study of the connection between the apical constriction of the ventral cells and the initiation of the invagination. For that, we have created a 3D biomechanical model of the embryo of the Drosophila melanogaster based on the finite element method. Each cell is modelled by an elastic hexahedron contour and is firmly attached to its neighbouring cells. A uniform initial distribution of elastic and contractile forces is applied to cells along the model. Numerical simulations show that invagination starts at ventral curved extremities of the embryo and then propagates to the ventral medial layer. Then, this observation already made in some experiments can be attributed uniquely to the specific shape of the embryo and we provide mechanical evidence to support it. Results of the simulations of the ""pill-shaped"" geometry of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo are compared with those of a spherical geometry corresponding to the Xenopus lÃ¦vis embryo. Eventually, we propose to study the influence of cell proliferation on the end of the process of invagination represented by the closure of the ventral furrow.",2016,"J Demongeot, A Lontos, E Promayon, J Demongeot, A Lontos, E Promayon"
Inhibition of Phagocytic Killing of Escherichia coli in Drosophila Hemocytes by RNA Chaperone Hfq,27357148,10.4049/jimmunol.1501953,"An RNA chaperone of Escherichia coli, called host factor required for phage QÎ² RNA replication (Hfq), forms a complex with small noncoding RNAs to facilitate their binding to target mRNA for the alteration of translation efficiency and stability. Although the role of Hfq in the virulence and drug resistance of bacteria has been suggested, how this RNA chaperone controls the infectious state remains unknown. In the present study, we addressed this issue using Drosophila melanogaster as a host for bacterial infection. In an assay for abdominal infection using adult flies, an E. coli strain with mutation in hfq was eliminated earlier, whereas flies survived longer compared with infection with a parental strain. The same was true with flies deficient in humoral responses, but the mutant phenotypes were not observed when a fly line with impaired hemocyte phagocytosis was infected. The results from an assay for phagocytosis in vitro revealed that Hfq inhibits the killing of E. coli by Drosophila phagocytes after engulfment. Furthermore, Hfq seemed to exert this action partly through enhancing the expression of ?(38), a stress-responsive ? factor that was previously shown to be involved in the inhibition of phagocytic killing of E. coli, by a posttranscriptional mechanism. Our study indicates that the RNA chaperone Hfq contributes to the persistent infection of E. coli by maintaining the expression of bacterial genes, including one coding for ?(38), that help bacteria evade host immunity.",2016,"Akiko Shiratsuchi, Mao Nitta, Ayumi Kuroda, Chiharu Komiyama, Mitsuko Gawasawa, Naoto Shimamoto, Tran Quoc Tuan, Teppei Morita, Hiroji Aiba, Yoshinobu Nakanishi, Akiko Shiratsuchi, Mao Nitta, Ayumi Kuroda, Chiharu Komiyama, Mitsuko Gawasawa, Naoto Shimamoto, Tran Quoc Tuan, Teppei Morita, Hiroji Aiba, Yoshinobu Nakanishi"

A total of 1948 proteins from whole flies and 1480 proteins from fly heads were differentially present in hypergravity-treated flies. Gene Ontology analysis of head-specific proteomics revealed host immune response, and humoral stress proteins were significantly upregulated. Proteins related to calcium regulation, ion transport, and ATPase were decreased.

Drosophila learn efficient paths to a food source,27063671,10.1016/j.nlm.2016.03.019,"Elucidating the genetic, and neuronal bases for learned behavior is a central problem in neuroscience. A leading system for neurogenetic discovery is the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster; fly memory research has identified genes and circuits that mediate aversive and appetitive learning.

There is currently no method to dynamically control flies' access to food. In rodents, protocols that use dynamic food delivery are a central element of experimental paradigms that date back to the influential work of Skinner. This method is still commonly used in the analysis of learning, memory, addiction, feeding, and many other subjects in experimental psychology. The difficulty of microscale food delivery means this is not a technique used in fly behavior. In the present manuscript we describe a microfluidic chip integrated with machine vision and automation to dynamically control defined liquid food presentations and sensory stimuli.

Insights from the reconstitution of the divergent outer kinetochore of Drosophila melanogaster,26911624,10.1098/rsob.150236,"Accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis is crucial for cellular and organismal viability. Kinetochores connect chromosomes with spindle microtubules and are essential for chromosome segregation. These large protein scaffolds emerge from the centromere, a specialized region of the chromosome enriched with the histone H3 variant CENP-A. In most eukaryotes, the kinetochore core consists of the centromere-proximal constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN), which binds CENP-A and contains 16 subunits, and of the centromere-distal Knl1 complex, Mis12 complex, Ndc80 complex (KMN) network, which binds microtubules and contains 10 subunits. In the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, the kinetochore underwent remarkable simplifications. All CCAN subunits, with the exception of centromeric protein C (CENP-C), and two KMN subunits, Dsn1 and Zwint, cannot be identified in this organism. In addition, two paralogues of the KMN subunit Nnf1 (Nnf1a and Nnf1b) are present. Finally, the Spc105R subunit, homologous to human Knl1/CASC5, underwent considerable sequence changes in comparison with other organisms. We combined biochemical reconstitution with biophysical and structural methods to investigate how these changes reflect on the organization of the Drosophila KMN network. We demonstrate that the Nnf1a and Nnf1b paralogues are subunits of distinct complexes, both of which interact directly with Spc105R and with CENP-C, for the latter of which we identify a binding site on the Mis12 subunit.

Central cholinergic synaptic vesicle loading obeys the set-point model in Drosophila,26655826,10.1152/jn.01053.2015,"Experimental evidence shows that neurotransmitter release, from presynaptic terminals, can be regulated by altering transmitter load per synaptic vesicle (SV) and/or through change in the probability of vesicle release. The vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) loads acetylcholine into SVs at cholinergic synapses. We investigated how the VAChT affects SV content and release frequency at central synapses in Drosophila melanogaster by using an insecticidal compound, 5Cl-CASPP, to block VAChT and by transgenic overexpression of VAChT in cholinergic interneurons. Decreasing VAChT activity produces a decrease in spontaneous SV release with no change to quantal size and no decrease in the number of vesicles at the active zone. This suggests that many vesicles are lacking in neurotransmitter. Overexpression of VAChT leads to increased frequency of SV release, but again with no change in quantal size or vesicle number. This indicates that loading of central cholinergic SVs obeys the ""set-point"" model, rather than the ""steady-state"" model that better describes loading at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction. However, we show that expression of a VAChT polymorphism lacking one glutamine residue in a COOH-terminal polyQ domain leads to increased spontaneous SV release and increased quantal size.

Regulation of starvation-induced hyperactivity by insulin and glucagon signaling in adult Drosophila,27612383,10.7554/eLife.15693,"Starvation induces sustained increase in locomotion, which facilitates food localization and acquisition and hence composes an important aspect of food-seeking behavior. We investigated how nutritional states modulated starvation-induced hyperactivity in adult Drosophila. The receptor of the adipokinetic hormone (AKHR), the insect analog of glucagon, was required for starvation-induced hyperactivity. AKHR was expressed in a small group of octopaminergic neurons in the brain. Silencing AKHR+ neurons and blocking octopamine signaling in these neurons eliminated starvation-induced hyperactivity, whereas activation of these neurons accelerated the onset of hyperactivity upon starvation. Neither AKHR nor AKHR+ neurons were involved in increased food consumption upon starvation, suggesting that starvation-induced hyperactivity and food consumption are independently regulated. Single cell analysis of AKHR+ neurons identified the co-expression of Drosophila insulin-like receptor (dInR), which imposed suppressive effect on starvation-induced hyperactivity. Therefore, insulin and glucagon signaling exert opposite effects on starvation-induced hyperactivity via a common neural target in Drosophila.",2016,"Yue Yu, Rui Huang, Jie Ye, Vivian Zhang, Chao Wu, Guo Cheng, Junling Jia, Liming Wang, Yue Yu, Rui Huang, Jie Ye, Vivian Zhang, Chao Wu, Guo Cheng, Junling Jia, Liming Wang"
The nutritional and hedonic value of food modulate sexual receptivity in Drosophila melanogaster females,26777264,10.1038/srep19441,"Food and sex often go hand in hand because of the nutritional cost of reproduction. For Drosophila melanogaster females, this relationship is especially intimate because their offspring develop on food. Since yeast and sugars are important nutritional pillars for Drosophila, availability of these foods should inform female reproductive behaviours. Yet mechanisms coupling food and sex are poorly understood. Here we show that yeast increases female sexual receptivity through interaction between its protein content and its odorous fermentation product acetic acid, sensed by the Ionotropic odorant receptor neuron Ir75a. A similar interaction between nutritional and hedonic value applies to sugars where taste and caloric value only increase sexual receptivity when combined. Integration of nutritional and sensory values would ensure that there are sufficient internal nutrients for egg production as well as sufficient environmental nutrients for offspring survival. These findings provide mechanisms through which females may maximize reproductive output in changing environments.",2016,"Jenke A Gorter, Samyukta Jagadeesh, Christoph Gahr, Jelle J Boonekamp, Joel D Levine, Jean-Christophe Billeter, Jenke A Gorter, Samyukta Jagadeesh, Christoph Gahr, Jelle J Boonekamp, Joel D Levine, Jean-Christophe Billeter"
The insulin receptor substrate Chico regulates antibacterial immune function in Drosophila,27134635,10.1186/s12979-016-0072-1,"Background:
      
    

    
      Molecular and genetic studies in model organisms have recently revealed a dynamic interplay between immunity and ageing mechanisms. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, inhibition of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway prolongs lifespan, and mutations in the insulin receptor substrate Chico extend the survival of mutant flies against certain bacterial pathogens. Here we investigated the immune phenotypes, immune signaling activation and immune function of chico mutant adult flies against the virulent insect pathogen Photorhabdus luminescens as well as to non-pathogenic Escherichia coli bacteria.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We found that D. melanogaster chico loss-of-function mutant flies were equally able to survive infection by P. luminescens or E. coli compared to their background controls, but they contained fewer numbers of bacterial cells at most time-points after the infection. Analysis of immune signaling pathway activation in flies infected with the pathogenic or the non-pathogenic bacteria showed reduced transcript levels of antimicrobial peptide genes in the chico mutants than in controls. Evaluation of immune function in infected flies revealed increased phenoloxidase activity and melanization response to P. luminescens and E. coli together with reduced phagocytosis of bacteria in the chico mutants. Changes in the antibacterial immune function in the chico mutants was not due to altered metabolic activity.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our results indicate a novel role for chico in the regulation of the antibacterial immune function in D. melanogaster. Similar studies will further contribute to a better understanding of the interconnection between ageing and immunity and lead to the identification and characterization of the molecular host components that modulate both important biological processes.",2016,"Sarah McCormack, Shruti Yadav, Upasana Shokal, Eric Kenney, Dustin Cooper, Ioannis Eleftherianos, Sarah McCormack, Shruti Yadav, Upasana Shokal, Eric Kenney, Dustin Cooper, Ioannis Eleftherianos"
Transcription factor zfh1 downregulates Drosophila Imd pathway,23178405,10.1016/j.dci.2012.10.007,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has a powerful innate immune system, which culminates on the synthesis of potent antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). This is mainly controlled by two conserved signaling cascades, the Toll and the immune deficiency (Imd) pathways. Like in humans, Drosophila immune responses need to be under tight control at multiple levels to avoid harmful inflammation. We have identified the transcription factor Zn finger homeodomain 1 (zfh1) as a negative regulator of Drosophila Imd signaling. Knocking down zfh1 in Drosophila S2 cells hyperactivates Imd pathway-mediated AMP expression, whereas forced zfh1 expression blocks Imd pathway response downstream of, or parallel to, the Imd pathway transcription factor Relish. In vivo zfh1 RNAi hyperactivates CecropinB induction upon gram-negative bacterial infection. We conclude that zfh1 is an important regulator of the immune response in Drosophila.",2013,"H MyllymÃ¤ki, M RÃ¤met, H MyllymÃ¤ki, M RÃ¤met"

This method requires only two generations and a total of six crosses in vials to estimate the genetic map position of the responsible lesion with high accuracy. This genetic map position can then be reliably used to identify the mutated gene through complementation testing with an average of nine deficiencies and Sanger sequencing. We have used this approach to successfully map a collection of mutations from an ethyl methanesulfonate-based mutagenesis screen on the third chromosome. We propose that this method also may be used in conjunction with whole-genome sequencing, particularly when multiple independent alleles of the mutated locus are not available.

However this live-cell method has relied on the use of the cell permeable Hoechst 33342 DNA-intercalating dye, limiting users to flow cytometers equipped with a UV laser.

Abdominal-B and caudal inhibit the formation of specific neuroblasts in the Drosophila tail region,23903193,10.1242/dev.096099,"The central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster consists of fused segmental units (neuromeres), each generated by a characteristic number of neural stem cells (neuroblasts). In the embryo, thoracic and anterior abdominal neuromeres are almost equally sized and formed by repetitive sets of neuroblasts, whereas the terminal abdominal neuromeres are generated by significantly smaller populations of progenitor cells. Here we investigated the role of the Hox gene Abdominal-B in shaping the terminal neuromeres. We show that the regulatory isoform of Abdominal-B (Abd-B.r) not only confers abdominal fate to specific neuroblasts (e.g. NB6-4) and regulates programmed cell death of several progeny cells within certain neuroblast lineages (e.g. NB3-3) in parasegment 14, but also inhibits the formation of a specific set of neuroblasts in parasegment 15 (including NB7-3). We further show that Abd-B.r requires cooperation of the ParaHox gene caudal to unfold its full competence concerning neuroblast inhibition and specification. Thus, our findings demonstrate that combined action of Abdominal-B and caudal contributes to the size and composition of the terminal neuromeres by regulating both the number and lineages of specific neuroblasts.",2013,"Oliver Birkholz, Olaf Vef, Ana Rogulja-Ortmann, Christian Berger, Gerhard M Technau, Oliver Birkholz, Olaf Vef, Ana Rogulja-Ortmann, Christian Berger, Gerhard M Technau"
Fatty acid composition of Drosophila photoreceptor light-sensitive microvilli,24346077,10.4067/S0716-97602013000300010,"Phototransduction, the mechanism underlying the electrical response to light in photoreceptor cells, has been thoroughly investigated in Drosophila melanogaster, an essential model in signal transduction research.

These microvilli encompass the phototransduction proteins, most of which are transmembrane and exclusively rhabdomeric. Rhabdomere membrane lipids play a crucial role in the activation of the transient receptor potential ionic channels (TRP and TRPL) responsible for initiating the photoresponse. Despite its importance, rhabdomere lipid composition has not been established. We developed a novel preparation enriched in rhabdomere membranes to perform a thorough characterization of the lipidomics of Drosophila rhabdomeres.

The present study investigates the proteomic response (2D-DIGE) of adult Drosophila melanogaster acclimated at 11, 25 or 31 Â°C. As expected 11 Â°C-acclimation improved cold tolerance and 31 Â°C-acclimation improved heat tolerance. We hypothesized that the marked organismal responses to acclimation could be detected at the proteomic level assuming that changes in the abundance of specific proteins are linked to the physiological changes underlying the phenotypic response. The 31 Â°C-acclimated flies displayed a particular divergent proteomic profile where molecular chaperones made up a large number of the proteins that were modulated during heat acclimation. Many other proteins showed significant modulation during acclimation including proteins involved in iron ion and cell redox homeostasis, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, chromatin remodeling and translation, and contractile machinery. Interestingly the changes in protein abundance were often unrelated to transcriptional activity of the genes coding for the proteins, except for the most strongly expressed proteins (e.g. Hsp70). The 11 Â°C-acclimation evoked weak proteomic response despite the marked effect on the organismal phenotype.

HIF- and non-HIF-regulated hypoxic responses require the estrogen-related receptor in Drosophila melanogaster,23382692,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003230,"Low-oxygen tolerance is supported by an adaptive response that includes a coordinate shift in metabolism and the activation of a transcriptional program that is driven by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. The precise contribution of HIF-1a in the adaptive response, however, has not been determined. Here, we investigate how HIF influences hypoxic adaptation throughout Drosophila melanogaster development. We find that hypoxic-induced transcriptional changes are comprised of HIF-dependent and HIF-independent pathways that are distinct and separable. We show that normoxic set-points of carbohydrate metabolites are significantly altered in sima mutants and that these animals are unable to mobilize glycogen in hypoxia. Furthermore, we find that the estrogen-related receptor (dERR), which is a global regulator of aerobic glycolysis in larvae, is required for a competent hypoxic response. dERR binds to dHIFa and participates in the HIF-dependent transcriptional program in hypoxia. In addition, dERR acts in the absence of dHIFa in hypoxia and a significant portion of HIF-independent transcriptional responses can be attributed to dERR actions, including upregulation of glycolytic transcripts. These results indicate that competent hypoxic responses arise from complex interactions between HIF-dependent and -independent mechanisms, and that dERR plays a central role in both of these programs.",2013,"Yan Li, Divya Padmanabha, Luciana B Gentile, Catherine I Dumur, Robert B Beckstead, Keith D Baker, Yan Li, Divya Padmanabha, Luciana B Gentile, Catherine I Dumur, Robert B Beckstead, Keith D Baker"

Modeling novelty habituation during exploratory activity in Drosophila,23597866,10.1016/j.beproc.2013.04.005,"Habituation is a common form of non-associative learning in which the organism gradually decreases its response to repeated stimuli. The decrease in exploratory activity of many animal species during exposure to a novel open field arena is a widely studied habituation paradigm. However, a theoretical framework to quantify how the novelty of the arena is learned during habituation is currently missing. Drosophila melanogaster display a high mean absolute activity and a high probability for directional persistence when first introduced to a novel arena. Both measures decrease during habituation to the arena. Here, we propose a phenomenological model of habituation for Drosophila exploration based on two principles: Drosophila form a spatial representation of the arena edge as a set of connected local patches, and repeated exposure to these patches is essential for the habituation of the novelty. The level of exposure depends on the number of visitations and is quantified by a variable referred to as ""coverage"". This model was tested by comparing predictions against the experimentally measured behavior of wild type Drosophila. The novelty habituation of wild type Canton-S depends on coverage and is specifically independent of the arena radius. Our model describes the time dependent locomotor activity, ?D, of Canton-S using an experimentally established stochastic process Pn(?D), which depends on the coverage. The quantitative measures of exploration and habituation were further applied to three mutant genotypes. Consistent with a requirement for vision in novelty habituation, blind no receptor potential A(7) mutants display a failure in the decay of probability for directional persistence and mean absolute activity. The rutabaga(2080) habituation mutant also shows defects in these measures. The kurtz(1) non-visual arrestin mutant demonstrates a rapid decay in these measures, implying reduced motivation. The model and the habituation measures offer a powerful framework for understanding mechanisms associated with open field habituation.",2013,"Benjamin Soibam, Shishir Shah, Gemunu H Gunaratne, Gregg W Roman, Benjamin Soibam, Shishir Shah, Gemunu H Gunaratne, Gregg W Roman"
Histamine-HisCl1 receptor axis regulates wake-promoting signals in Drosophila melanogaster,23844178,10.1371/journal.pone.0068269,"Histamine and its two receptors, histamine-gated chloride channel subunit 1 (HisCl1) and ora transientless (Ort), are known to control photoreception and temperature sensing in Drosophila. However, histamine signaling in the context of neural circuitry for sleep-wake behaviors has not yet been examined in detail. Here, we obtained mutant flies with compromised or enhanced histamine signaling and tested their baseline sleep. Hypomorphic mutations in histidine decarboxylase (HDC), an enzyme catalyzing the conversion from histidine to histamine, caused an increase in sleep duration. Interestingly, hisCl1 mutants but not ort mutants showed long-sleep phenotypes similar to those in hdc mutants. Increased sleep duration in hisCl1 mutants was rescued by overexpressing hisCl1 in circadian pacemaker neurons expressing a neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF). Consistently, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated depletion of hisCl1 in PDF neurons was sufficient to mimic hisCl1 mutant phenotypes, suggesting that PDF neurons are crucial for sleep regulation by the histamine-HisCl1 signaling. Finally, either hisCl1 mutation or genetic ablation of PDF neurons dampened wake-promoting effects of elevated histamine signaling via direct histamine administration. Taken together, these data clearly demonstrate that the histamine-HisCl1 receptor axis can activate and maintain the wake state in Drosophila and that wake-activating signals may travel via the PDF neurons.",2013,"Yangkyun Oh, Donghoon Jang, Jun Young Sonn, Joonho Choe, Yangkyun Oh, Donghoon Jang, Jun Young Sonn, Joonho Choe"
Meta-analysis reveals that genes regulated by the Y chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster are preferentially localized to repressive chromatin,23315381,10.1093/gbe/evt005,"The Drosophila Y chromosome is a degenerated, heterochromatic chromosome with few functional genes.

Here, we present a meta-analysis of four previously published microarray studies of Y-linked regulatory variation (YRV) in D. melanogaster. We show that YRV genes are far from a random subset of the genome: They are more likely to be in repressive chromatin contexts, be expressed tissue specifically, and vary in expression within and between species than non-YRV genes. Furthermore, YRV genes are more likely to be associated with the nuclear lamina than non-YRV genes and are generally more likely to be close to each other in the nucleus (although not along chromosomes). Taken together, these results suggest that variation on the Y chromosome plays a role in modifying how the genome is distributed across chromatin compartments, either via changes in the distribution of DNA-binding proteins or via changes in the spatial arrangement of the genome in the nucleus.",2013,"Timothy B Sackton, Daniel L Hartl, Timothy B Sackton, Daniel L Hartl"
Recognition of methylated peptides by Drosophila melanogaster polycomb chromodomain,23320494,10.1021/pr3011205,"Lysine methylation is one of the important post-translational modifications (PTMs) that regulate protein functions. Up to now, proteomic identification of this PTM remains a challenge due to the lack of effective enrichment methods in mass spectrometry experiments. To address this challenge, we present here a systematic approach to predicting peptides in which lysine residues may be methylated to mediate protein-protein interactions. We used the chromodomain of the polycomb protein in Drosophila melanogaster as a model system to illustrate the success of this approach. We started with molecular dynamics simulations and free energy analyses on the histone peptides complexed with the polycomb chromodomain to understand how the binding specificity is achieved. We next conducted virtual mutagenesis to quantify each domain and peptide residue's contribution to the domain-peptide recognition, based on which scoring scheme was developed to evaluate the possibility of any lysine-containing peptides to be methylated and recognized by the chromodomain. A peptide microarray experiment on a panel of conserved histone peptides showed a satisfactory prediction accuracy of the scoring scheme. Next, we implemented a bioinformatics pipeline that integrates multiple lines of evidence including conservation, subcellular localization, and mass spectrometry data to scan the fly proteome for a systematic identification of possible methyllysine-containing peptides.

A small cohort of FRU(M) and Engrailed-expressing neurons mediate successful copulation in Drosophila melanogaster,23688386,10.1186/1471-2202-14-57,"Background:
      
    

    
      In Drosophila, male flies require the expression of the male-specific Fruitless protein (FRU(M)) within the developing pupal and adult nervous system in order to produce male courtship and copulation behaviors. Recent evidence has shown that specific subsets of FRU(M) neurons are necessary for particular steps of courtship and copulation. In these neurons, FRU(M) function has been shown to be important for determining sex-specific neuronal characteristics, such as neurotransmitter profile and morphology.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We identified a small cohort of FRU(M) interneurons in the brain and ventral nerve cord by their co-expression with the transcription factor Engrailed (En). We used an En-GAL4 driver to express a fru(M) RNAi construct in order to selectively deplete FRU(M) in these En/FRU(M) co-expressing neurons. In courtship and copulation tests, these males performed male courtship at wild-type levels but were frequently sterile. Sterility was a behavioral phenotype as these En-fru(M)RNAi males were less able to convert a copulation attempt into a stable copulation, or did not maintain copulation for long enough to transfer sperm and/or seminal fluid.

GABA(B) receptors play an essential role in maintaining sleep during the second half of the night in Drosophila melanogaster,24068350,10.1242/jeb.085563,"GABAergic signalling is important for normal sleep in humans and flies. Here we advance the current understanding of GABAergic modulation of daily sleep patterns by focusing on the role of slow metabotropic GABAB receptors in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We asked whether GABAB-R2 receptors are regulatory elements in sleep regulation in addition to the already identified fast ionotropic Rdl GABAA receptors. By immunocytochemical and reporter-based techniques we show that the pigment dispersing factor (PDF)-positive ventrolateral clock neurons (LNv) express GABAB-R2 receptors. Downregulation of GABAB-R2 receptors in the large PDF neurons (l-LNv) by RNAi reduced sleep maintenance in the second half of the night, whereas sleep latency at the beginning of the night that was previously shown to depend on ionotropic Rdl GABAA receptors remained unaltered. Our results confirm the role of the l-LNv neurons as an important part of the sleep circuit in D. melanogaster and also identify the GABAB-R2 receptors as the thus far missing component in GABA-signalling that is essential for sleep maintenance.

Here, using a set of 91 inbred Drosophila melanogaster lines from five populations, we explore patterns of diversity and recent evolution in the Wolbachia strain wMel. Within the D. melanogaster lines, we identify six major mitochondrial clades and four wMel clades. Concordant with past studies, the Wolbachia haplotypes contain an overall low level of nucleotide diversity, yet they still display geographic structuring. Using Bayesian analysis informed with demographic estimates of colonization times, we estimate that all extant D. melanogaster mitochondrial haplotypes coalesce to a Wolbachia-infected ancestor approximately 2200 years ago. Finally, we measure wMel titre within the infected flies and find that titre varies across populations, an effect attributable to host genetic factors. This demonstration of local phenotypic divergence suggests that intraspecific host genetic variation plays a key role in shaping this model symbiotic system.",2013,"Angela M Early, Andrew G Clark"
Females and males contribute in opposite ways to the evolution of gene order in Drosophila,23696898,10.1371/journal.pone.0064491,"An intriguing association between the spatial layout of chromosomes within nuclei and the evolution of chromosome gene order was recently uncovered. Chromosome regions with conserved gene order in the Drosophila genus are larger if they interact with the inner side of the nuclear envelope in D. melanogaster somatic cells. This observation opens a new door to understand the evolution of chromosomes in the light of the dynamics of the spatial layout of chromosomes and the way double-strand breaks are repaired in D. melanogaster germ lines. Chromosome regions at the nuclear periphery in somatic cell nuclei relocate to more internal locations of male germ line cell nuclei, which might prefer a gene order-preserving mechanism to repair double-strand breaks. Conversely, chromosome regions at the nuclear periphery in somatic cells keep their location in female germ line cell nuclei, which might be inaccessible for cellular machinery that causes gene order-disrupting chromosome rearrangements. Thus, the gene order stability for genome regions at the periphery of somatic cell nuclei might result from the active repair of double-strand breaks using conservative mechanisms in male germ line cells, and the passive inaccessibility for gene order-disrupting factors at the periphery of nuclei of female germ line cells. In the present article, I find evidence consistent with a DNA break repair-based differential contribution of both D. melanogaster germ lines to the stability/disruption of gene order. The importance of germ line differences for the layout of chromosomes and DNA break repair strategies with regard to other genomic patterns is briefly discussed.",2013,"Carlos DÃ­az-Castillo, Carlos DÃ­az-Castillo"
Freeze-drying as sample preparation for micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography-electrochemical separations of neurochemicals in Drosophila brains,23387977,10.1021/ac303377x,"Micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography with electrochemical detection has been used to quantify biogenic amines in freeze-dried brains of Drosophila melanogaster. Freeze-drying samples offers a way to preserve the biological sample while making dissection of these tiny samples easier and faster. Fly samples were extracted in cold acetone and dried in a rotary evaporator. Extraction and drying times were optimized in order to avoid contamination by red pigment from the fly eyes and still have intact brain structures. Single freeze-dried fly brain samples were found to produce representative electropherograms as a single hand-dissected brain sample. With utilization of the faster dissection time that freeze-drying affords, the number of brains in a fixed homogenate volume can be increased to concentrate the sample.

Transcriptional basis of the acclimation to high environmental temperature at the olfactory receptor organs of Drosophila melanogaster,23590196,10.1186/1471-2164-14-259,"Background:
      
    

    
      Environmental temperature directly affects the concentrations of chemicals in the gas phase. Therefore, if the olfactory system does not physiologically adapt to environmental conditions, it may provide inadequate information about the distance to or direction of odor sources. Previous reports have shown at the behavioral level that temperature induces changes in olfactory sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster. These changes are initiated in the main olfactory receptor organs, the antennae. In this work, we attempted to identify the particular genes responsible for olfactory adaptation to increasing temperatures in these organs based on current knowledge of the molecular basis of olfactory reception.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Whole-genome transcriptional responses to transitory temperature shifts from 21-30Â°C were analyzed in the third antennal segments of Drosophila. More than 53% of the genome was expressed in these organs; this percentage increased slightly (55%) after heat treatment. However, the expression levels increased for 26%, decreased for 21% and remained constant for 53% of the expressed genes. Analysis of the changes produced in 389 genes related to heat response and olfactory reception, according to the current functional annotations of the Drosophila gene set, showed significant differences in 95 of these genes, which are involved in the heat response (23), perireceptor events in olfaction (50), olfactory and gustatory receptors (18) and G-proteins and transduction cascades (4).
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Gene expression was altered in response to environmental heat in the antennae of Drosophila by increasing or decreasing expression. Different acclimation patterns emerged for reception through the basiconic, trichoid and coeloconic sensilla. Changes in genes with a central role in olfactory reception, such as orco, may account for part of the acclimation reported at the behavioral level.",2013,"Jacob Riveron, Tamara Boto, Esther Alcorta, Jacob Riveron, Tamara Boto, Esther Alcorta"
RNA-mediated interference and reverse transcription control the persistence of RNA viruses in the insect model Drosophila,23435119,10.1038/ni.2542,"How persistent viral infections are established and maintained is widely debated and remains poorly understood. We found here that the persistence of RNA viruses in Drosophila melanogaster was achieved through the combined action of cellular reverse-transcriptase activity and the RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) pathway. Fragments of diverse RNA viruses were reverse-transcribed early during infection, which resulted in DNA forms embedded in retrotransposon sequences. Those virus-retrotransposon DNA chimeras produced transcripts processed by the RNAi machinery, which in turn inhibited viral replication. Conversely, inhibition of reverse transcription hindered the appearance of chimeric DNA and prevented persistence. Our results identify a cooperative function for retrotransposons and antiviral RNAi in the control of lethal acute infection for the establishment of viral persistence.",2013,"Bertsy Goic, Nicolas Vodovar, Juan A Mondotte, ClÃ©ment Monot, Lionel Frangeul, HervÃ© Blanc, ValÃ©rie Gausson, Jorge Vera-Otarola, Gael Cristofari, Maria-Carla Saleh, Bertsy Goic, Nicolas Vodovar, Juan A Mondotte, ClÃ©ment Monot, Lionel Frangeul, HervÃ© Blanc, ValÃ©rie Gausson, Jorge Vera-Otarola, Gael Cristofari, Maria-Carla Saleh"
Atlas of olfactory organs of Drosophila melanogaster 2. Internal organization and cellular architecture of olfactory sensilla,18088928,10.1016/s1467-8039(00)00028-1,"Antennae and maxillary palps of Drosophila melanogaster were studied with the electron microscope on serial sections of cryofixed specimens. The number of epidermal cells roughly equals the number of sensilla, except for regions where the latter are scarce or absent. Each epidermal cell forms about two non-innervated spinules, a prominent subcuticular space and a conspicuous basal labyrinth, suggesting a high rate of fluid transport through the sensory epithelium. The internal organization and fine structure of trichoid, intermediate and basiconic sensilla is very similar. Receptor cell somata are invested by thin glial sheaths extending distad to the inner dendritic segments. Further distally, the thecogen cell forms a sleeve around the dendrites, but an extracellular dendrite sheath is absent. At the base of the cuticular apparatus, the inner sensillum-lymph space around the ciliary and outer dendritic segments is confluent with the large outer sensillum-lymph space formed by the trichogen and tormogen cells. All three auxiliary cells exhibit many features of secretory and transport cells but extend only thin basal processes towards the haemolymph sinus. The bauplan and fine structure of coeloconic sensilla differs in the following aspects: (1) the ciliary segment of the dendrites is located deeper below the base of the cuticular apparatus than in the other sensillum types; (2) a prominent dendrite sheath is always present, separating inner and outer sensillum-lymph spaces completely; (3) the apical microlamellae of the auxiliary cells are more elaborate, but free sensillum-lymph spaces are almost absent; (4) there are always four not three auxiliary cells. Morphometric data are presented on the diameter of inner and outer dendritic segments and on the size of receptor cells, as well as of the receptor and auxiliary cell nuclei. The special fine structural features of Drosophila olfactory sensilla are discussed under the aspects of sensillar function and the localization of proteins relevant for stimulus transduction.",2000,"S R Shanbhag, B MÃ¼ller, R A Steinbrecht, S R Shanbhag, B MÃ¼ller, R A Steinbrecht"
The expression pattern of a mouse doublesex-related gene is consistent with a role in gonadal differentiation,10640721,10.1016/s0925-4773(99)00282-8,"The signal for somatic sex determination in mammals, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster is chromosomal, but the overall mechanisms do not appear to be conserved between the phyla.

These data suggest that at least some aspects of the regulation of sex determination might be conserved. In humans, a doublesex-related gene (DMRT1) was identified at less than 30 kb from the critical region for sex reversal on chromosome 9p24 (TD9). In order to get insights into the role of DMRT1 in sex determination/differentiation, we have isolated DMRT1 mouse homologue (Dmrt1) and analysed its expression pattern.

By examining potential hydrogen bonding sites in the major groove, we identified a 14-bp palindromic pattern centered on the 8-bp target site duplication that is generated by P element insertion.

Cold tolerance in Drosophila: adaptive variations revealed by the analysis of starvation survival reaction norms,10838173,10.1016/s0306-4565(99)00106-0,"Three species of Drosophila were investigated for their capacity to survive without food (starvation tolerance) at seven different temperatures ranging from 0 to 25 degrees C. In all cases biphasic response curves (reaction norms) were observed, corresponding either to special deleterious effects of cold or to a progressive exhaustion of reserves proportional to metabolic rate. The temperature at which survival was longest was called the threshold temperature. The position of the threshold exhibited adaptive changes, either due to acclimation in the same species, or to genetic variations evidenced between species. In D. melanogaster, adults grown at lower temperature (12 degrees C) were more tolerant to cold than adults grown at higher temperatures (21, 25 or 30 degrees C). This acclimation process shifted, in an adaptive way, the position of the threshold temperature from 6.2 to 7.5 degrees C. A comparison of three different species grown at a single developmental temperature (21 degrees C) revealed similar but greater adaptive differences in their threshold temperature: 4.8 degrees C in the temperate D. subobscura, 7 degrees C in the cosmopolitan D. melanogaster and 14.6 degrees C in the tropical D. ananassae.",2000,"D Karan, JR David, D Karan, JR David"

Genetic control of acute ethanol-induced behaviors in Drosophila,10968649,,"Background:
      
    

    
      In most organisms in which acute ethanol exposure has been studied, it leads to similar changes in behavior. Generally, low ethanol doses activate the central nervous system, whereas high doses are sedative. Sensitivity to the acute intoxicating effects of ethanol is in part under genetic control in rodents and humans, and reduced sensitivity in humans predicts the development of alcoholism (Crabbe et al., 1994; Schuckit, 1994). We have established Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to study the mechanisms that regulate acute sensitivity to ethanol.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      We measured the effects of ethanol vapor on Drosophila locomotor behaviors by using three different assays. Horizontal locomotion was quantified in a locomotor chamber, turning behavior was assayed in narrow tubes, and ethanol-induced loss of postural control was measured in an inebriometer. Mutants with altered sensitivity to the acute effects of ethanol were generated by treatment with ethyl methane sulfonate and isolated by selection in the inebriometer. We ascertained the effects of these mutations on ethanol pharmacokinetics by measuring ethanol levels in extracts of flies at various times during and after ethanol exposure.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Among nearly 30,000 potentially mutant flies tested, we isolated 19 mutant strains with reduced and 4 strains with increased sensitivity to the acute effects of ethanol as measured in the inebriometer. Of these mutants, four showed changes in ethanol absorption. Two mutants, named barfly and tipsy to reflect their reduced and increased ethanol sensitivity in the inebriometer, respectively, were analyzed for locomotor behaviors. Both mutants exhibited ethanol-induced hyperactivity that was indistinguishable from wild type. However, barfly and tipsy displayed reduced and increased sensitivity to the sedative effects of ethanol, respectively. Finally, both mutants showed an increased rate of ethanol-induced turning behavior.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The effects of acute ethanol exposure on Drosophila locomotor behaviors are remarkably similar to those described for mammals. The analysis of mutants with altered sensitivity to ethanol revealed that the genetic pathways which regulate these responses are complex and that single genes can affect hyperactivity, turning, and sedation independently.",2000,"C M Singh, U Heberlein, C M Singh, U Heberlein"
Phosphorylation of the insect immunophilin FKBP46 by the Spodoptera frugiperda homolog of casein kinase II,10767538,10.1016/s0378-1119(00)00077-9,"Immunophilins are a family of conserved proteins found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, that exhibit peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity. Members of this family bind to immunosuppressive drugs and on this basis are divided into two classes: FKBPs bind to FK506 and rapamycin, while cyclophilins bind to cyclosporin A. In this paper, we report on insect immunophilin FKBP46 and its associated kinase. The insect FKBP46 belongs to the high-molecular-weight immunophilins and shares many characteristic features with its mammalian counterparts, but its functional role remains unclear. Here, we show that FKBP46 is phosphorylated by a protein kinase present in the nucleus of both insect Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) and human Jurkat cells. This protein kinase is immunoreactive with polyclonal antiserum raised against Drosophila melanogaster casein kinase II (CKII). We have cloned, overexpressed and characterized a new member of the CKII family derived from Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Recombinant Sf9 CKII alpha subunit shares 75% identity to human, chicken and Drosophila melanogaster homologs, whereas the Sf9 CKII beta subunit is 77% identical to rat, chicken and human. Moreover, we demonstrate that the insect immunophilin FKBP46 can be phosphorylated by human and Sf9 casein kinase II.

Dopamine-depleted females show increased resistance to copulation; 20-day-old females demonstrated an increase in copulation avoidance compared with younger (5-15-day-old) females. These changes in dopaminergic-modulated behaviors observed during aging parallel declines in whole body levels of dopamine. Immunocytochemical analysis of adult brains using an antibody raised against Drosophila tyrosine hydroxylase to visualize catecholaminergic cell bodies revealed increased degeneration of the cell bodies with aging.

Cell-cell adhesion via the ECM: integrin genetics in fly and worm,10936444,10.1016/s0945-053x(00)00064-0,"Integrins are essential for the development of the two genetically tractable invertebrate model organisms, the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Just two integrins are present in C. elegans: one putative RGD binding integrin alphapat-2betapat-3, corresponding to Drosophila alphaPS2betaPS and vertebrate alpha5beta1, alphaVbeta1 and alpha8beta1, and one putative laminin binding integrin alphaina-1betapat-3, corresponding to Drosophila alphaPS1betaPS and vertebrate alpha3beta1, alpha6beta1 and alpha7beta1. In this review, the function of this minimal set of integrins during the development of these two invertebrates is compared. Despite the differences in bodyplan and developmental strategy, integrin adhesion to the extracellular matrix is required for similar processes: the formation of the link that translates muscle contraction into movement of the exoskeleton, cell migration, and morphogenetic interactions between epithelia. Other integrin functions, such as regulation of gene expression, have not yet been experimentally demonstrated in both organisms. Additional proteins have been characterised in each organism that are essential for integrin function, including extracellular matrix ligands and intracellular interacting proteins, but so far different proteins have been found in the two organisms. This in part represents the fact that the characterisation of the full set of interacting proteins is not complete in either system. However, in other cases different proteins appear to be used for similar functions in the two animals. The continued use of genetic approaches to identify proteins required for integrin function in these two model organisms should lead to the identification of the minimal set of conserved components that form integrin adhesive structures.",2000,"N H Brown, N H Brown"

Recent discovery of strains that rescue these inviability and sterility phenotypes has made it possible to study the developmental basis of reproductive isolation between these two species in greater detail. By producing both rescued and unrescued hybrids and examining the protein product staining patterns of genes known to be involved in early germline development and gametogenesis, we have found that in crosses between D. simulans and D. melanogaster, hybrid female sterility results from the improper control of primordial germline proliferation, germline stem cell maintenance, and cystoblast formation and differentiation during early oogenesis. Rescued hybrid females are fertile, yet they generally have lower amounts of adult germline from the outset and show a premature degeneration of adult germline cells with age. In addition, older rescued hybrid females also exhibit mutant egg phenotypes associated with defects in dorso-ventral patterning which may result from the improper partitioning of cytoplasmic factors during early oogenesis that could stem from the early defect. Although a variety of germline and oogenic defects are described for the hybrid females, all of them can potentially result from the same underlying primary defect. Hybrid males from these same crosses, on the other hand, have no detectable germline in adult reproductive tissues, even when hybrid sterility rescue strains are used, indicating that male sterility and female sterility stem from distinctly different developmental defects.",2000,"H Hollocher, K Agopian, J Waterbury, R W O'Neill, A W Davis, H Hollocher, K Agopian, J Waterbury, R W O'Neill, A W Davis"

Twelve sequences from D. melanogaster that may correspond to new elements are also described. Some of these sequences are similar to those of OSVALDO: and Ulysses, two elements of the OSVALDO: clade that had never before been described for D. melanogaster. Comparative analyses of multiple organisms, some of them with completely sequenced genomes, show that the number of lineages of Ty3/GYPSY: elements is very variable. Thus, while only 1 lineage is present in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, at least 6 exist in Caenorhabditis elegans, at least 9 are present in the A. thaliana, and perhaps 20 are present in D. melanogaster.

"Long microsatellite alleles in Drosophila melanogaster have a downward mutation bias and short persistence times, which cause their genome-wide underrepresentation",10880482,,"Microsatellites are short tandemly repeated DNA sequence motifs that are highly variable in most organisms. In contrast to mammals, long microsatellites (>15 repeats) are extremely rare in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. To investigate this paucity of long microsatellites in Drosophila, we studied 19 loci with exceptionally long microsatellite alleles. Inter- and intraspecific analysis showed that long microsatellite alleles arose in D. melanogaster only very recently. This lack of old alleles with many repeats indicated that long microsatellite alleles have short persistence times. The size distribution of microsatellite mutations in mutation-accumulation lines suggests that long alleles have a mutation bias toward a reduction in the number of repeat units. This bias causes the short persistence times of long microsatellite alleles. We propose that species-specific, size-dependent mutation spectra of microsatellite alleles may provide a general mechanism to account for the observed differences in microsatellite length between species.",2000,"B Harr, C SchlÃ¶tterer, B Harr, C SchlÃ¶tterer"
no-bridge and linotte act jointly at the interhemispheric junction to build up the adult central brain of Drosophila melanogaster,11091077,10.1016/s0925-4773(00)00483-4,"The Drosophila transmembrane protein Linotte (Lio) is expressed in a glial transcient interhemispheric fibrous ring (TIFR), which was hypothesised to serve as scaffold for adult brain formation during metamorphosis. We isolated TIFR specific enhancers from the lio locus and showed that only four interhemispheric cells give rise to this complex fibrous structure. We showed that lio controls the TIFR differentiation, and confirmed the major role played by this structure in central brain metamorphosis since its destruction by apoptosis led to a pronounced adult phenotype, which included defects of lio and no-bridge (nob) mutants. lio interhemispheric expression was specifically affected in a nob(1) context, confirming that nob plays a key role in adult brain development via the TIFR.",2000,"R Hitier, A F Simon, F Savarit, T PrÃ©at, R Hitier, A F Simon, F Savarit, T PrÃ©at"
Variations of male cuticular hydrocarbons with geoclimatic variables: an adaptative mechanism in Drosophila melanogaster?,11678502,10.1023/a:1017987220814,"7-tricosene (7T) and 7-pentacosene (7P) are the major components of cuticular hydrocarbons in Drosophila simulans and D. melanogaster males.

Then a large scale study of male 7T/7P polymorphism was performed with 85 populations of D. melanogaster and 29 of D. simulans collected all over the world. There were significant correlations of the values of the balanced ratio (7T- 7P)/(7T + 7P) with geo-climatic parameters, such as latitude, longitude, mean temperature, temperature range and vapour pressure. Parallel variations were also reported for the homologous linear alkanes (23 and 25 Carbon atoms) but not for the longer branched alkanes (27 and 29 Carbon atoms).

A new assay for the genetic study of general anesthesia in Drosophila melanogaster: use in analysis of mutations in the X-chromosomal 12E region,10938546,10.3109/01677060009083475,"We describe a new measure of the influence of general anesthetics on Drosophila that uses the robust tendency of fruit flies to briskly walk upwards after being tapped down. We expose flies to a fixed concentration of anesthetic gas in a 50 ml tube for a period of up to 1 h and then test the distribution of flies in the tube shortly after tapping them to its bottom. By measuring the effect of a series of anesthetic concentrations on the fraction of flies that fail to climb, we derive quantitative descriptors of the potency of the drug. This ""distribution test"" is superior to previous assays of anesthetic potency in terms of ease and reliability. We have used the assay to further the genetic analysis of several mutations that cluster on the X chromosome and are known to influence both neural function and anesthesia sensitivity. The results establish complementation patterns between the mutations, refine their genetic map positions, and open the way for the molecular identification of the relevant gene(s).",2000,"Z Guan, R L Scott, H A Nash, Z Guan, R L Scott, H A Nash"
"Biochemical and genetic interactions between Drosophila caspases and the proapoptotic genes rpr, hid, and grim",10733594,10.1128/mcb.20.8.2907-2914.2000,"In Drosophila melanogaster, the induction of apoptosis requires three closely linked genes, reaper (rpr), head involution defective (hid), and grim. The products of these genes induce apoptosis by activating a caspase pathway. Two very similar Drosophila caspases, DCP-1 and drICE, have been previously identified. We now show that DCP-1 has a substrate specificity that is remarkably similar to those of human caspase 3 and Caenorhabditis elegans CED-3, suggesting that DCP-1 is a death effector caspase. drICE and DCP-1 have similar yet different enzymatic specificities. Although expression of either in cultured cells induces apoptosis, neither protein was able to induce DNA fragmentation in Drosophila SL2 cells. Ectopic expression of a truncated form of dcp-1 (DeltaN-dcp-1) in the developing Drosophila retina under an eye-specific promoter resulted in a small and rough eye phenotype, whereas expression of the full-length dcp-1 (fl-dcp-1) had little effect. On the other hand, expression of either full-length drICE (fl-drICE) or truncated drICE (DeltaN-drICE) in the retina showed no obvious eye phenotype. Although active DCP-1 protein cleaves full-length DCP-1 and full-length drICE in vitro, GMR-DeltaN-dcp-1 did not enhance the eye phenotype of GMR-fl-dcp-1 or GMR-fl-drICE flies. Significantly, GMR-rpr and GMR-grim, but not GMR-hid, dramatically enhanced the eye phenotype of GMR-fl-dcp-1 flies.

A tyramine receptor gene mutation causes a defective olfactory behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,10713442,10.1016/s0378-1119(99)00569-7,"We characterized molecular profiles of a new olfactory mutant line, honoka (hono), which was found among 500 viable P-element insertion lines screened first by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indrolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining on the third segment of the antenna, and then by behavioral assays to several pure chemicals. The behavioral responses of hono mutants to repellents such as ethyl acetate (EA), benzaldehyde (BZ) and 4-methylcycrohexanol (MCH), were reduced compared with those of a control strain. The location of the P-element insertion was determined to be about 100bp) upstream of the first exon of the tyramine receptor gene. The level of 3.6kb tyramine receptor mRNA expression was reduced in hono compared with that of wild-type flies. The tyramine receptor cDNA hybridized to the chromosomal division 79C-D, the same locus as the P-element insertion point in hono, and not to 99A-B, previously reported by Arakawa et al. (1990. Neuron 2, 343-354). Electrophysiological responses to octopamine and tyramine were examined by measuring the excitatory junctional potential (EJP) amplitude from larval body-wall muscles of the hono mutant. The hono was impaired with responding to tyramine, while displaying normal response to octopamine. These results indicate that tyramine has a functional role in the Drosophila olfactory system as a neurotransmitter or a neuromodulator, and hono is the first tyramine receptor mutant.

Females receptive to remating oviposited more eggs in both species; however, the species differed in the association between remating behavior and the number and distribution of oocyte stages. We found no differences in the number of either developing eggs of different stages or mature eggs between female D. pseudoobscura that were either receptive or nonreceptive to remating. In contrast, D. melanogaster females that are receptive to remating had significantly more mature eggs in the ovaries than nonreceptive females. Nonremating females had a significantly greater number of immature, vitellogenic oocytes. These results suggest that factors associated with oogenesis are related to female remating behavior in D. melanogaster but not in D. pseudoobscura.

Regulation of EGF receptor signaling in the fruitfly D. melanogaster and the nematode C. elegans,15687590,10.3233/bd-1999-11103,"Mammals contain four members (HER1/EGFR, HER2/Neu, HER3, and HER4) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, which transduce extracellular signals by EGF family peptide growth factors. Upon binding of ligand with receptor, dimerization and auto-phosphorylation of the receptor results in a cascade of events which transmit signal from the cell surface to the nucleus. Amplification and/or uncontrolled signaling of these receptors is associated with many cancers. 10 to 34% of human breast cancers are associated with amplification or overexpression of the HER2/neu oncogene, an EGFR homolog [1]. Signaling from the EGFR plays a critical role in the development of many organisms including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, each of which contain a single EGFR homolog. The powerful genetic techniques offered by these organisms has allowed new components of the EGFR signal transduction pathway to be identified as well as lending insight into the basis of tissue specificity of signaling.",2000,"C J Lacenere, P W Sternberg, C J Lacenere, P W Sternberg"
Conserved roles for peptidases in the processing of invertebrate neuropeptides,10961940,,"Invertebrates use a wide range of peptides as transmitters and hormones to regulate complex behaviour, physiology and development. These animals, especially those that are amenable to genetic study and are the subject of genome-sequencing projects, provide powerful model systems for understanding the functions of peptidases in controlling the bioactivity of peptides. Neprilysin, a zinc metallopeptidase and a key enzyme in the metabolism of mammalian peptides, is also implicated in the inactivation of peptides at synapses and of circulating peptide hormones in insects and nematodes. A family of neprilysin-like genes are present in the genomes of both Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans; in C. elegans it seems that individual family members have evolved to take on different physiological functions, because they are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Angiotensin I-converting enzymes (peptidyl dipeptidase A, angiotensin-converting enzyme) are another group of zinc metallopeptidases found in some invertebrates that lack angiotensin peptides. In D. melanogaster there are two functional angiotensin-converting enzymes that are essential for normal development. One of these (Acer) is expressed in the embryonic heart, whereas the second enzyme (Ance) is expressed in several tissues at different stages of the life cycle. The accumulation of Ance within secretory vesicles of some peptide-synthesizing cells suggests a role for the enzyme in the intracellular processing of insect peptides. Ance is very efficient at cleaving pairs of basic residues from the C-terminus of partly processed peptides, suggesting a novel role for the enzyme in prohormone processing. Invertebrates will continue to provide insights into the evolutionarily conserved functions of known peptidases and of those additional family members that are expected to be identified in the future from genome-sequencing projects.",2000,"R E Isaac, R J Siviter, P Stancombe, D Coates, A D Shirras, R E Isaac, R J Siviter, P Stancombe, D Coates, A D Shirras"
Molecular determinants of differential ligand sensitivities of insect ecdysteroid receptors,10805730,10.1128/mcb.20.11.3870-3879.2000,"The functional receptor for insect ecdysteroid hormones is a heterodimer consisting of two nuclear hormone receptors, ecdysteroid receptor (EcR) and the retinoid X receptor homologue Ultraspiracle (USP). Although ecdysone is commonly thought to be a hormone precursor and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), the physiologically active steroid, little is known about the relative activity of ecdysteroids in various arthropods. As a step toward characterization of potential differential ligand recognition, we have analyzed the activities of various ecdysteroids using gel mobility shift assays and transfection assays in Schneider-2 (S2) cells. Ecdysone showed little activation of the Drosophila melanogaster receptor complex (DmEcR-USP). In contrast, this steroid functioned as a potent ligand for the mosquito Aedes aegypti receptor complex (AaEcR-USP), significantly enhancing DNA binding and transactivating a reporter gene in S2 cells. The mosquito receptor also displayed higher hormone-independent DNA binding activity than the Drosophila receptor. Subunit-swapping experiments indicated that the EcR protein, not the USP protein, was responsible for ligand specificity. Using domain-swapping techniques, we made a series of Aedes and Drosophila EcR chimeric constructs. Differential ligand responsiveness was mapped near the C terminus of the ligand binding domain, within the identity box previously implicated in the dimerization specificity of nuclear receptors. This region includes helices 9 and 10, as determined by comparison with available crystal structures obtained from other nuclear receptors. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Phe529 in Aedes EcR, corresponding to Tyr611 in Drosophila EcR, was most critical for ligand specificity and hormone-independent DNA binding activity. These results demonstrated that ecdysone could function as a bona fide ligand in a species-specific manner.",2000,"S F Wang, S Ayer, W A Segraves, D R Williams, A S Raikhel, S F Wang, S Ayer, W A Segraves, D R Williams, A S Raikhel"
[Heavy heat shock induces genetic variation in a polygenic system of a quantitative trait in Drosophila],10822810,,"Results of two experiments dealing with positive and negative selection on the quantitative trait radius incompletus in an isogenic line of Drosophila melanogaster after heavy heat shock (HHS) are presented. Selection was not effective in the control without HHS. In experiment 1, in which offspring of HHS-exposed males lacked transposition induction, selection also was ineffective. By contrast, selection was highly effective in offspring of males that responded to HHS exposure by transposition induction. Thus, HHS, which is not mutagenic, generates genetic variation in a polygenic system of a quantitative trait via transpositions and excisions of mobile genetic elements. In experiment 2, positive and negative selection was conducted in three replicates, which showed concerted dynamics of the selected trait. This means that the trait dynamics is mainly related to the nearly deterministic process of accumulation of active polygenic alleles rather than to genetic drift. The induced variation of polygenic systems promotes rapid selection of ""champion"" genotypes. This variation is probably associated with ""soft"" modification of polygene expression by adjacent MGE copies.",2000,"L A Vasil'eva, V A Ratner, L A Vasil'eva, V A Ratner"

The combgap locus encodes a zinc-finger protein that regulates cubitus interruptus during limb development in Drosophila melanogaster,10976041,,"The combgap locus, first described by C. B. Bridges in 1925, is a gene required for proper anteroposterior pattern formation in the limbs of Drosophila melanogaster. The development of the anteroposterior axis of fly limbs is initiated by hedgehog signaling from cells of the posterior half to cells of the anterior half of the limb primordium. Hedgehog signaling requires the anterior-specific expression of the gene cubitus interruptus to establish posterior-specific hedgehog secretion and anterior-specific competence to respond to hedgehog. We have cloned combgap and find that it encodes a chromosomal protein with 11 C(2)H(2) zinc fingers. Limb defects found in combgap mutants consist of either loss or duplication of pattern elements in the anteroposterior axis and can be explained through the inappropriate expression of cubitus interruptus and its downstream target genes. In combgap mutants, cubitus interruptus is ectopically expressed in the posterior compartments of wing imaginal discs and is downregulated in the anterior compartment of legs, wings and antennae. We are able to rescue anterior compartment combgap phenotypes by expressing additional cubitus interruptus using the Gal4/UAS system. Dominant alleles of cubitus interruptus, which result in posterior expression, phenocopy combgap posterior compartment phenotypes. Finally, we find that the combgap protein binds to polytene chromosomes at many sites including the cubitus interruptus locus, suggesting that it could be a direct regulator of cubitus interruptus transcription.",2000,"P C Svendsen, S D Marshall, M Kyba, W J Brook, P C Svendsen, S D Marshall, M Kyba, W J Brook"

The outburst of the yellow-2 mutations was attributed to the spreading of the X chromosome, which contained an inversion of the yellow regulatory region, through the population. Reinversion resulted in the wild-type phenotype. Crossing lines carrying the inversion with laboratory line C(1)DX, ywf induced instability of the yellow alleles, which was associated with duplication or multiplication of a fragment of the yellow gene.

The total sequence of one cDNA clone and the corresponding genomic DNA was determined and expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The purified and thrombin cleaved recombinant protein phosphorylated the four deoxyribonucleosides with high turnover and K(m) values similar to those of the native Dm-dNK, as well as the four ribonucleosides and many therapeutical nucleoside analogs.

The bands were identified according to Bridges' revised light microscopic map. On Bridges' map, the divisions 11 to 20 contain 112 single bands and as many as 181 double bands. A majority of Bridges' single bands were identified in the thin sections. A total of 23 Bridges' single bands (and 4 bands of division 20) could not be found; in particular, bands were missing from the difficult regions 11DE, 15A, 15C and 16A. Electron microscopy showed the existence of 18 additional faint bands, 4 at the region 18D and 7 at 19EF. Bridges' faintest single bands and the new bands were best seen in formaldehyde fixed material. About 1/4 of Bridges' double bands were found to be made up of two separate bands each. The remaining Bridges' doublets include all kinds of bands: broad, narrow, dark, faint, puffed.

Pigment-dispersing hormone-immunoreactive neurons in the nervous system of wild-type Drosophila melanogaster and of several mutants with altered circadian rhythmicity,8276996,10.1002/cne.903370202,"Antisera against the crustacean pigment-dispersing hormone (beta-PDH) were used in immunocytochemical preparations to investigate the anatomy of PDH-immunoreactive neurons in the nervous system of wild-type Drosophila melanogaster and in that of several brain mutants of this species, some of which express altered circadian rhythmicity. In the wild-type and in all rhythmic mutants (small optic lobes, sine oculis, small optic lobes; sine oculis), eight cell bodies at the anterior base of the medulla (PDFMe neurons) exhibit intense PDH-like immunoreactivity. Four of the eight somata are large and four are smaller. The four large PDFMe neurons have wide tangential arborizations in the medulla and send axons via the posterior optic tract to the contralateral medulla. Fibers from the four small PDFMe neurons ramify in the median protocerebrum dorsal to the calyces of the mushroom bodies. Their terminals are adjacent to other PDH-immunoreactive somata (PDFCa neurons) which send axons via the median bundle into the tritocerebrum. The results suggest a possible involvement of the PDFMe neurons in the circadian pacemaking system of Drosophila. The location and size of the PDFMe neurons are identical with those of neurons containing the period protein which is essential for circadian rhythmicity. Changes in the arborizations of the PDFMe neurons in small optic lobes; sine oculis mutants are suited to explain the splitting in the locomotor rhythm of these flies. In the arrhythmic mutant, disconnected, the PDFMe neurons are absent. The arrhythmic mutant per0, however, shows normal PDH immunoreactivity and therefore, does not prevent the expression of PDH-like peptides in these neurons.",1993,"C Helfrich-FÃ¶rster, U Homberg, C Helfrich-FÃ¶rster, U Homberg"
Enhancer detector analysis of the extent of genomic involvement in nervous system development in Drosophila melanogaster,8392532,10.1002/neu.480240609,"We conducted a survey of the patterns of gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS) of larvae of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster to identify genes that may be important in the development of the CNS, aid in the recognition of basic organizing features that might underlie CNS development, and estimate the extent of the use of information encoded in the genome in the construction of the nervous system. A so-called enhancer detector strategy was used to generate many thousands of lines containing a beta-galactosidase reporter gene. These lines were screened as third-instar larvae for patterns of expression in the developing optic lobes and other portions of the CNS. Most of the lines recovered which evidence staining within the CNS could be included in one of a relatively small number of patterns. A random sample of 594 lines from the larger population screened was selected to quantify the relative frequencies of these patterns, and a more careful analysis of the changes in the patterns of expression with developmental time was done for representative lines of nine of the patterns. These studies demonstrated great variability in the pattern of gene expression as a function of developmental stage. Few, if any, lines showed beta-galactosidase activity limited to the optic lobes; similarly, few lines were identified in which staining was limited to only a small number of cells. Together with the limited number of patterns of gene expression seen, this suggests that in the larval CNS developmental pathways may be controlled by a combinatorial process of gene activity that involves the majority of the genome rather than by having a specific gene specify the fate of only a few neuronal precursors.",1993,"S Datta, K Stark, D R Kankel, S Datta, K Stark, D R Kankel"

During secretion (stages 10b, 11 and 12) the lipid vesicles are accumulated on the vitelline membrane surface and become flat. At the late stages of choriogenesis (stages 13, 14) the lipid vesicles are compressed tightly between the vitelline membrane and the other already constructed eggshell layers, so the wax layer becomes very thin and is hardly seen in cross-fractured views.",1993,"I S Papassideri, L H Margaritis, T Gulik-Krzywicki, I S Papassideri, L H Margaritis, T Gulik-Krzywicki"

One important genetic element in this regard is the homeobox, which was initially discovered in the genes controlling the early development of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.

Accounting for bias in estimates of the rate of polygenic mutation,8234366,10.1098/rspb.1993.0116,"Experimental data on the rate of response to artificial selection in initially inbred lines or the rate of divergence among inbred sublines can be used to estimate the rate of increase in variance of quantitative traits from new mutations. So far estimates have been based on the infinitesimal model of many genes with small additive effects which imply a rate of increase in heritability for Drosophila melanogaster bristle number traits of about 0.1% per generation. Such estimates are biased because mutants tend to have large effects, to have non-additive gene action, and to be deleterious. Here, recent information on the distribution of effects of new mutations on Drosophila melanogaster bristle number and viability is used to infer the direction and magnitude of this bias. The infinitesimal model tends to underestimate the mutational variance, typically by a factor of about 3, but this factor depends on the experimental design. Averages of revised estimates, accounting for this bias, of the per generation increment in heritability from mutation are 0.36% and 0.21% for abdominal and sternopleural bristle number, respectively, in experiments involving M strains, and 1.4% and 0.7% for abdominals and sternopleurals, respectively, in P strains.",1993,"P D Keightley, T F Mackay, A Caballero, P D Keightley, T F Mackay, A Caballero"
Activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on cultured Drosophila and other insect neurones,7504110,10.1113/jphysiol.1993.sp019613,"1. Using whole-cell and single channel recordings, we have examined the properties of acetylcholine (ACh)-activated currents in neurones from larval and pupal Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), larval and embryonic Musca domestica (house fly), and nymphal Schistocerca gregaria (locust). 2. In all preparations, single channel recordings revealed two major classes of ACh-activated channels, with average conductances of approximately 32 and 59 pS. 3. At ACh concentrations from 1 to 10 microM, channel activity in Drosophila larval neurones occurs in bursts with an average of 1-2 openings. Open times and burst durations are described by one or two exponentials. Burst durations for the 32 pS channel (approximately 3 ms, slow component) were longer than those for the 59 pS channel (approximately 1.0 ms). The mean open interval duration for the 32 pS channel (slow component) was also longer than that of the 59 pS channel. 4. At high ACh (20-200 microM) concentrations, bursts of the smaller conductance channel occur in clusters separated by long-lived periods without channel activity. Considerable kinetic heterogeneity was observed among clusters. 5. The whole-cell dose-response curve suggests that activation of current by ACh increases up to at least 100 microM and that multiple ligand binding steps are involved. 6. Drosophila and Musca larval neuronal ACh-activated channels show some unique features in their cholinergic pharmacological properties: (a) they are only weakly activated by the potent neuromuscular nicotinic agonist suberyldicholine, (b) hexamethonium and decamethonium are weak, but approximately equi-effective blockers, and (c) alpha- and kappa-bungarotoxin (BTX) both blocked reversibly, though alpha-BTX appears to be the more potent inhibitor.",1993,"J L Albert, C J Lingle, J L Albert, C J Lingle"
Molecular cloning of a human homologue of Drosophila heterochromatin protein HP1 using anti-centromere autoantibodies with anti-chromo specificity,8505380,,"We have identified a novel autoantibody specificity in scleroderma that we term anti-chromo. These antibodies recognize several chromosomal antigens with apparent molecular mass of between 23 and 25 kDa, as determined by immunoblots. Anti-chromo autoantibodies occur in 10-15% of sera from patients with anti-centromere antibodies (ACA). We used anti-chromo antibodies to screen a human expression library and obtained cDNA clones encoding a 25 kDa chromosomal autoantigen. DNA sequence analysis reveals this protein to be a human homologue of HP1, a heterochromatin protein of Drosophila melanogaster. We designate our cloned protein HP1Hs alpha. Epitope mapping experiments using both human and Drosophila HP1 reveal that anti-chromo antibodies target a region at the amino terminus of the protein. This region contains a conserved motif, the chromo domain (or HP1/Pc box), first recognized by comparison of Drosophila HP1 with the Polycomb gene product. Both proteins are thought to play a role in creating chromatin structures in which gene expression is suppressed. Anti-chromo thus defines a novel type of autoantibody that recognizes a conserved structural motif found on a number of chromosomal proteins.",1993,"W S Saunders, C Chue, M Goebl, C Craig, R F Clark, J A Powers, J C Eissenberg, S C Elgin, N F Rothfield, W C Earnshaw, W S Saunders, C Chue, M Goebl, C Craig, R F Clark, J A Powers, J C Eissenberg, S C Elgin, N F Rothfield, W C Earnshaw"

These images show that topo II is concentrated at specific sites within the interphase nucleus and that this localization is temporally regulated. The enzyme is not restricted to a central chromosome axis, but is distributed uniformly throughout the chromosome. During mitosis, the enzyme present in the early prophase chromosome is lost in two stages, following prophase and following anaphase. Overall, 70% of the enzyme leaves the nucleus and diffuses into the cytoplasm. The localization of the enzyme thus correlates with its role in chromosome condensation and segregation. Rather than being solely a structural protein, topo II appears to localize at the sites on the chromosome where it is required.",1993,"J R Swedlow, J W Sedat, D A Agard, J R Swedlow, J W Sedat, D A Agard"
Conservation and change of the developmentally crucial fushi tarazu gene in Drosophila,8100278,10.1007/BF00182179,"We have studied the evolutionary changes occurring in the noncoding regions around the developmentally important fushi tarazu (ftz) gene in a total of 11 species in the genus Drosophila. Previous molecular developmental studies have identified DNA elements both 3' and 5' to the coding region which are important in proper regulation of expression of the Drosophila melanogaster ftz gene. We show here that these same elements are the most evolutionarily conserved regions in the vicinity of the gene homologs. Parts of some control elements are more conserved than exonic sequences. Not only is there sequence conservation, but the relative position, orientation, and distances among the control elements remain conserved. One quite significant difference does exist between the two major subgenera studied, Sophophora and Drosophila: namely, an inversion of the ftz unit with respect to other genes in the Antennapedia complex, ANT-C. As a comparison, we applied similar analysis to a ""housekeeping"" gene-rosy (ry), or Xdh. In contrast, DNA sequences 5' to the ry coding region revealed little evolutionary conservation. These studies bear out the proposition that functionally important DNA sequences remain more conserved through evolutionary time than do less functionally important sequences. This proposition could be tested in the present case because we could predict a priori from the developmental studies which DNA regions should be most conserved.",1993,"D Maier, D Sperlich, J R Powell, D Maier, D Sperlich, J R Powell"
Analysis of a fushi tarazu autoregulatory element: multiple sequence elements contribute to enhancer activity,8096173,,"Regulatory sequences or factors involved in the regulation of target genes of Drosophila homeodomain proteins are largely unknown. Here, we identify sequence elements that are involved in the function of the fushi tarazu (ftz) autoregulatory element AE, a direct in vivo target of the homeodomain protein ftz. A systematic deletion analysis of AE in transgenic embryos defines multiple elements that are redundantly involved in enhancer activity. Sequences juxtaposed to ftz binding sites are not strictly required for enhancer function. Several sequence motifs are conserved in other developmentally regulated genes of Drosophila melanogaster and in the AE homologue of Drosophila virilis. The D. virilis AE is functional in D. melanogaster.

This repeat contains genes for all five histone proteins (H1, H2a, H2b, H3, and H4) and differs from the previously reported one by a second EcoRI site. These D. hydei repeats have been aligned to each other and to the 5.0-kb (i.e., long) and 4.8-kb (i.e., short) histone repeat types from D. melanogaster. In each species, base composition at synonymous sites is similar to the average genomic composition and approaches that in the small intergenic spacers of the histone gene repeats. Accumulation of synonymous changes at synonymous sites after the species diverged is quite high. Both of these features are consistent with the relatively low codon usage bias observed in these genes when compared with other Drosophila genes. Thus, the generalization that abundantly expressed genes in Drosophila have high codon bias and low rates of silent substitution does not hold for the histone genes.",1993,"D H Fitch, L D Strausbaugh, D H Fitch, L D Strausbaugh"

In this study, the 5' untranslated region of the I factor was joined to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, and activity was assayed in transfected D. melanogaster tissue culture cells and transformed flies. The results have identified a promoter that lies within the first 186 pb of the I factor. Deletion analysis shows that nucleotides +1 to +40 are sufficient for high promoter activity and accurate transcription initiation. This region contains sequences that are found in a class of RNA polymerase II promoters that lack both a TATA box and CpG-rich motifs. In transformed flies, high levels of expression from nucleotides +1 to +186 are confined to the ovaries of reactive females, suggesting that the promoter is involved in the tissue and cytotype specificity of transposition.",1993,"C McLean, A Bucheton, D J Finnegan, C McLean, A Bucheton, D J Finnegan"

The flies were treated for 1 to 6 weeks and the eggs laid in 3 hours were counted each week during and after treatment. The capacity of treated flies egg laying was determined on treated media and then on untreated one. For the benomyl preparation (Benlate) and the mancozebe preparation (Dithane M45), there was an overall reduction of the egg mass on treated media but not on untreated media. There appears to be an essential repulsive effect which perturbs egg laying and causes a retention of eggs. However, after 3 to 4 weeks the quantity of egg mass also diminished on untreated media. Once the treatment was terminated the capacity to lay eggs partially returned. The copper sulfate preparation (Bouillie bordelaise) also exhibited a repulsive effect as exhibited by a retention of a certain number of eggs, but there was a more direct and fast effect on fecundity. Effect was more brutal with the dichlofluanide preparation (EuparÃ¨ne), and rapidly irreversible: the egg masses were very reduced after only one week of treatment on both treated and untreated media, and after termination of treatment there was an incomplete and temporary recuperation of the capacity to lay eggs. The results presented here are in agreement with those obtained previously concerning longevity. At the doses recommended for agricultural treatments, Benlate and Dithane M45 showed low toxicity for Drosophila adults in comparison with Bouillie bordelaise and EuparÃ¨ne which revealed a high toxicity in agreement with the fecundity and longevity data.",1993,"D Marchal-SÃ©gault, D Marchal-SÃ©gault"

We have carried out high resolution cytological mapping of Zhr using deficiencies and duplications of the X heterochromatin. Deletions of the Zhr+ gene from the hybrid genome exhibit the Zhr phenotype. On the contrary, addition of the wild-type gene to the hybrid genome causes embryonic lethality, regardless of sex.

Structural changes in the antennapedia complex of Drosophila pseudoobscura,8099892,,"The discovery of the striking positional conservation between the Antennapedia and Bithorax homeotic gene complexes (ANT-C and BX-C) in Drosophila melanogaster and the murine Hox and human HOX clusters has had a substantial impact on our understanding of the evolution of development and its genetic regulation. Structural differences do exist among the mammalian Hox complexes and the ANT-C in D. melanogaster. To gain further insight into the evolutionary changes among these complexes, the ANT-C was cloned in the closely related species, Drosophila pseudoobscura. The overall structure of the ANT-C in D. pseudoobscura is highly similar to its D. melanogaster counterpart; however, two differences in the organization of the ANT-C have been identified. First, the z2 gene, a member of the ANT-C in D. melanogaster, is not present in the D. pseudoobscura ANT-C and is possibly absent from the D. pseudoobscura genome. Second, the orientation of the Deformed gene is inverted in D. pseudoobscura, providing it with a 5' to 3' direction of transcription identical to the remaining ANT-C homeobox genes with the exception of fushi tarazu. These differences demonstrate that subtle changes can occur in ANT-C structure during relatively short periods of evolutionary divergence, although the fundamental organization of the complex is conserved. These observations and others suggest that the complex is not absolutely rigid but that selective pressures have maintained this organization of genes for some functional reason that remains elusive.",1993,"F M Randazzo, M A Seeger, C A Huss, M A Sweeney, J K Cecil, T C Kaufman, F M Randazzo, M A Seeger, C A Huss, M A Sweeney, J K Cecil, T C Kaufman"

A total of 79 lethal mutations were isolated, representing at least 17 lethal complementation groups, including one corresponding to the Psn gene. Fine structure mapping of the genomic region surrounding the Psn transcription unit by transgenic rescue experiments allowed us to localize two of the essential loci together with Psn within an approximately 12-kb genomic DNA region. One of these loci, located 3' to Psn, encodes a Drosophila protein related to the yeast 60S ribosomal protein L10 precursor. We also determined which of the newly recovered lethal mutant groups correspond to previously isolated lethal P-element insertions, lethal inversion breakpoints, and lethal polo gene mutants. Point mutations were identified in all five recovered Psn alleles, one of which results in a single amino acid substitution G-E at a conserved residue in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the protein, suggesting an important functional role for this C-terminal domain of Presenilin.

We show here that the fusion protein consists of functional GFP and functional histone His2AvD. The His2AvD portion of the fusion gene was shown to be functional by rescue of His2AvD mutant lethality. Fluorescence of the fusion protein in vivo was observed in embryonic cleavage stage interphase nuclei and on chromosomes as early as cycle 9, correlating with activation of transcription. Unlike transcription factors, the His2AvDGFP protein remained on transcriptionally inactive chromosomes throughout mitosis. Subsequently, fluorescence was observed in nuclei at all stages of embryonic and larval development and in adult somatic tissues, consistent with the distribution of His2AvD observed by immunohistochemical staining. This functional fusion histone acts as an excellent in vivo marker for chromosomes and chromosome behavior and, given the ability of the fusion gene to prevent null-mutant lethality, without disrupting normal cellular functions. The very high level of conservation of the H2A.F/Z family of variant histones suggests that the equivalent fusion protein construct should function equally well in a wide range of organisms.",1999,"M Clarkson, R Saint, M Clarkson, R Saint"
Evolution of the proportions of two sigma viral types in experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster in the absence of the allele that is restrictive of viral multiplication,10581286,,"A minority of flies in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster are endemically infected by a rhabdovirus, sigma. The virus is vertically transmitted through male and female gametes. Two alleles of a fly locus, the ref(2)P locus, are present as a polymorphism in all populations: O permissive, and P restrictive for viral multiplication and transmission. Two viral types are known, Type I, which is very sensitive to the P allele, and Type II, which is more resistant. Previous observations have shown that, in presence of the P allele, viral Type II is selected for, in both natural and experimental populations. The aim of the present study was to determine whether, in the absence of P, Type I is selected for, or whether the two types are equivalent. For this purpose, experimental populations deprived of the P allele and differing in the initial proportions of the two viral types were established. After several generations, and despite a possible bias toward Type I, the frequencies of Type I and Type II clones differed in the various populations, depending on their initial values. These findings do not rule out selective advantage of viral Type I in the absence of P, but suggest that, if any, this advantage is in no way comparable to that displayed by viral Type II in the presence of P.",1999,"A Fleuriet, A Fleuriet"
In vitro evolution of preferred topoisomerase II DNA cleavage sites,9988773,10.1074/jbc.274.8.5227,"Topoisomerase II is an essential enzyme that is the target for several clinically important anticancer drugs. Although this enzyme must create transient double-stranded breaks in the genetic material in order to carry out its indispensable DNA strand passage reaction, the factors that underlie its nucleotide cleavage specificity remain an enigma. Therefore, to address the critical issue of enzyme specificity, a modified systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) protocol was employed to select/evolve DNA sequences that were preferentially cleaved by Drosophila melanogaster topoisomerase II. Levels of DNA scission rose substantially (from 3 to 20%) over 20 rounds of SELEX. In vitro selection/evolution converged on an alternating purine/pyrmidine sequence that was highly AT-rich (TATATATACATATATATA). The preference for this sequence was more pronounced for Drosophila topoisomerase II over other species and was increased in the presence of DNA cleavage-enhancing anticancer drugs. Enhanced cleavage appeared to be based on higher rates of DNA scission rather than increased binding affinity or decreased religation rates. The preferred sequence for topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage is dramatically overrepresented ( approximately 10,000-fold) in the euchromatic genome of D. melanogaster, implying that it may be a site for the physiological action of this enzyme.",1999,"D A Burden, N Osheroff, D A Burden, N Osheroff"

The influence of nonassociative processes on the acquisition was of minor importance, even though Central Excitatory State increased with age. Old flies proved also to be the slowest to extinguish. Because nonassociative contamination was not involved during extinction, one may wonder whether extinction was delayed in old flies mainly due to a higher level of acquisition or to a behavioral rigidity.",1999,"N Fresquet, N Fresquet"
Organization of the ferritin genes in Drosophila melanogaster,10619605,10.1089/104454999314791,"The organization of two closely clustered genes, Fer1HCH and Fer2LCH, encoding the heavy-chain homolog (HCH) and the light-chain homolog (LCH) subunits of Drosophila melanogaster ferritin are reported here. The 5019-bp sequence of the cluster was assembled from genomic fragments obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA and from sequences obtained from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) (http://www.fruitfly.org). These genes, located at position 99F1, have different exon-intron structures (Fer1HCH has three introns and Fer2LCH has two introns) and are divergently transcribed. Computer analysis of the possibly shared promoter regions revealed the presence of putative metal regulatory elements (MREs), a finding consistent with the upregulation of these genes by iron, and putative NF-kappaB-like binding sites. The structure of two other invertebrate ferritin genes, from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (located on chromosomes I and V), was also analyzed. Both nematode genes have two introns, lack iron-responsive elements (IREs), and encode ferritin subunits similar to vertebrate H chains. These findings, along with comparisons of ferritin genes from invertebrates, vertebrates, and plants, suggest that the specialization of ferritin H and L type chains, the complex exon-intron organization of plant and vertebrate genes, and the use of the IRE/iron regulatory protein (IRP) mechanism for regulation of ferritin synthesis are recent evolutionary acquisitions.",1999,"B C Dunkov, T Georgieva, B C Dunkov, T Georgieva"
Developmental regulation of granule size and numbers in larval salivary glands of drosophila by steroid hormone ecdysone,10736190,10.1006/cbir.1999.0433,"The size and number of secretory granules in late larval salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster have been related to interecdysial and early metamorphic development represented by well-known puffs in polytene chromosomes. Interecdysial period (puff stage 1 (PS1)) is characterized by presence of numerous small granules (11,000 per cell). The transition from PSI to early metamorphic phase (PS2 and upwards), induced by rapid elevation in endogenous steroid hormone ecdysone, is accompanied by continuous growth of granule diameter with concomitant reduction in their number per cell. In the PS4, just prior to secretion, approximately 3000 mature granules occur per cell. The mature state is associated with the change from hyperbolic to Gaussian distribution of granule number over their size range. Similar changes in secretory granule parameters were observed in interecdysial salivary glands explanted from 3rd instar larvae and cultured in vitro in medium containing 5x10(-6) m ecdysone.",1999,"R Farkas, G SuÃ¡kovÃ¡, R Farkas, G SuÃ¡kovÃ¡"
Central complex substructures are required for the maintenance of locomotor activity in Drosophila melanogaster,10573866,10.1007/s003590050387,"In Drosophila melanogaster, former studies based on structural brain mutants have suggested that the central complex is a higher control center of locomotor behavior. Continuing this investigation we studied the effect of the central complex on the temporal structure of spontaneous locomotor activity in the time domain of a few hours. In an attempt to dissect the internal circuitry of the central complex we perturbed a putative local neuronal network connecting the four neuropil regions of the central complex, the protocerebral bridge, the fan-shape body, the noduli and the ellipsoid body. Two independent and non-invasive methods were applied: mutations affecting the neuroarchitecture of the protocerebral bridge, and the targeted expression of tetanus toxin in small subsets of central complex neurons using the binary enhancer trap P[GAL4] system. All groups of flies with a disturbed component of this network exhibited a common phenotype: a drastic decrease in locomotor activity. While locomotor activity was still clustered in bouts and these were initiated at the normal rate, their duration was reduced. This finding suggests that the bridge and some of its neural connections to the other neuropil regions of the central complex are required for the maintenance but not the initiation of walking.",1999,"J R Martin, T Raabe, M Heisenberg, J R Martin, T Raabe, M Heisenberg"
A compact gene cluster in Drosophila: the unrelated Cs gene is compressed between duplicated amd and Ddc,10231575,10.1016/s0378-1119(99)00096-7,"Cs, a gene with unknown function, and amd and Ddc, which encode decarboxylases, are among the most closely spaced genes in D. melanogaster. Untranslated 3' ends of the convergently transcribed genes Cs and Ddc are known to overlap by 88bp. A number of questions arise about the organization of this tightly-packed gene region and about the evolution and function of the Cs gene. We have now investigated this three-gene cluster in Scaptodrosophila lebanonensis (which diverged from D. melanogaster 60-65 MYA), as well as in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Gene order and direction of transcription is the same in all three species. The Cs gene codes, in Scaptodrosophila, for a polypeptide of 544 amino acids; in D. melanogaster, it consists of 504 amino acids, which is twice as long as previously suggested, which makes the gene density even more spectacular. The Cs sequences exhibit higher number of non-synonymous substitutions between species, higher ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, and lower codon usage bias than other genes, suggesting that Cs is less functionally constrained than the other genes. This is consistent with the failure of inducing phenotypic mutations in D. melanogaster. The function of Cs remains to be identified, but a high degree of similarity indicates that it is homologous to genes coding for a corticosteroid-binding protein in yeast and a polyamine oxidase in maize.",1999,"A Tatarenkov, A G SÃ¡ez, F J Ayala, A Tatarenkov, A G SÃ¡ez, F J Ayala"
Measuring Drosophila (fruit fly) activity during microgravity exposure,11543046,,"Important advances in the understanding of the aging process could be obtained through comprehension of the changes experienced by Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) during microgravity. Previous experiments flown on Cosmos satellites and various Space Shuttle missions have shown a significant decrease in the life span of young male Drosophila after microgravity exposure. Additionally, postflight analysis indicated an accelerated aging of the microgravity exposed male flies since they exhibited a significant decrease in mating ability and a consistently lower negative geotaxis response than the 1 g ground controls. The negative geotaxis response is the Drosophila's reaction to move opposite to the Earth's gravitational vector when disturbed in certain manners. Researchers have hypothesized that the accelerated aging, is due to an increased locomotor activity which causes a subsequent increase in mitochondrial activity. The increased mitochondrial activity, in turn, causes increased aging through accelerated damage to the mitochondrial system. An increase in locomotor activity was indicated by analyzing only a fraction (1/6th of a second) of the 15 minute video recordings of groups of Drosophila taken approximately every two days during a 14-day Space Shuttle flight. The increased locomotor activity may be related to the Drosophila's negative geotaxis response in that the flies may be reacting to the absence of normal gravity by continuously searching for the gravity vector. The aims of this study are to develop methods to accurately measure individual Drosophila activity, use these derived methods in 1 g to create a Drosophila activity baseline, and use the methods during short and long duration microgravity exposure (sounding rockets, parabolic flights, Space Shuttle, International Space Station, etc.) to examine Drosophila activity. The role of the negative geotaxis response on locomotor activity will be examined by using two strains of behaviorally selected Drosophila, one that exhibits a large or hyper negative geotaxis response and another that has a positive geotaxis response, in addition to examining flies with a normal or negative geotaxis response.",1999,"M S Miller, T S Keller, M S Miller, M S Miller, T S Keller, M S Miller"
Patterns of nucleotide substitution in Drosophila and mammalian genomes,9990048,10.1073/pnas.96.4.1475,"To estimate patterns of molecular evolution of unconstrained DNA sequences, we used maximum parsimony to separate phylogenetic trees of a non-long terminal repeat retrotransposable element into either internal branches, representing mainly the constrained evolution of active lineages, or into terminal branches, representing mainly nonfunctional ""dead-on-arrival"" copies that are unconstrained by selection and evolve as pseudogenes. The pattern of nucleotide substitutions in unconstrained sequences is expected to be congruent with the pattern of point mutation. We examined the retrotransposon Helena in the Drosophila virilis species group (subgenus Drosophila) and the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup (subgenus Sophophora). The patterns of point mutation are indistinguishable, suggesting considerable stability over evolutionary time (40-60 million years). The relative frequencies of different point mutations are unequal, but the ""transition bias"" results largely from an approximately 2-fold excess of G.C to A.T substitutions. Spontaneous mutation is biased toward A.T base pairs, with an expected mutational equilibrium of approximately 65% A + T (quite similar to that of long introns). These data also enable the first detailed comparison of patterns of point mutations in Drosophila and mammals. Although the patterns are different, all of the statistical significance comes from a much greater rate of G.C to A.T substitution in mammals, probably because of methylated cytosine ""hotspots."" When the G.C to A.T substitutions are discounted, the remaining differences are considerably reduced and not statistically significant.",1999,"D A Petrov, D L Hartl, D A Petrov, D L Hartl"

The gene is present as a single copy in the Drosophila genome and maps at position 62E6-7 on polytene chromosomes. It is expressed ubiquitously at all stages of development.

Rediscovery and further characterization of the aeroplane (ae) wing posture mutation in Drosophila melanogaster,10382289,10.1139/g98-143,"In 1931, Theodore Quelprud characterized a novel spontaneous mutation in Drosophila melanogaster, which was named aeroplane (ae) based on its abnormal wing posture. Although the characterization of the original ae locus was minimal, it is very likely that another allele of this extinct mutation has now been identified. aeroplane-like (ae-l) was isolated as a by-product of a transformation experiment. The apparent wing paralysis is not caused by any obvious abnormalities in the thorax, wing, indirect flight muscles or direct flight muscles. Classical genetic complementation analyses of ae-l with other genes in the region suggest that it represents an allele of a novel locus. Unexpectedly, a molecular examination revealed that the physical lesion identified in the ae-l mutant is exceptionally close to the homeotic gene teashirt (tsh) and, indeed, may represent an unusual allele of teashirt.",1999,"K H Soanes, J B Bell, K H Soanes, J B Bell"
Comparative mapping of cosmids and gene clones from a 1.6 Mb chromosomal region of Drosophila melanogaster in three species of the distantly related subgenus Drosophila,10199954,10.1007/s004120050349,"The successful hybridization of cosmid clones from Drosophila melanogaster (Sophophora subgenus) to the salivary gland chromosomes of other species as distantly related as those in the Drosophila subgenus attests their great potential for unravelling genome evolution. We have carried out, using 28 cosmids and 13 gene clones, a study of the organization of the D. melanogaster 95A-96A chromosomal region in three Drosophila subgenus species: D. repleta, D. buzzattii and D. virilis. These clones were first used to built an accurate map of this 1.6 Mb region of D. melanogaster chromosome 3R (Muller's element E). Then, they were hybridized and mapped to the homologous chromosome 2 of the other three distantly related species. The studied region is disseminated over 13 different sites of chromosome 2 in the Drosophila subgenus species, which implies a minimum of 12 inversion breakpoints fixed between the two subgenera. Extrapolation to the entire chromosome gives 90 fixed inversions. The D. melanogaster Pp1-96A-Acr96Aa segment conserved in D. repleta and D. buzzatii is longer than previously thought and is also conserved in D. virilis. In addition, three other D. melanogaster segments conserved in the three Drosophila subgenus species were found.

This review explores the potential of neoplastic studies in Drosophila to help understand the genomic mechanisms of neoplastic development in vertebrates and invertebrates.

Biogenic amine systems in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,10332728,10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19990415)45:2<106::AID-JEMT5>3.0.CO;2-3,"Biogenic amines are important neuroactive molecules of the central nervous system (CNS) of several insect species. Serotonin (5HT), dopamine (DA), histamine (HA), and octopamine (OA) are the amines which have been extensively studied in Drosophila melanogaster. Each one of the four aminergic neuronal systems exhibits a stereotypic pattern of a small number of neurons that are widely distributed in the fly CNS. In this review, histochemical and immunocytochemical data on the distribution of the amine neurons in the larval and adult nervous system, are summarized. The majority of DA and 5HT neurons are interneurons, most of which are found in bilateral clusters. 5HT innervation is found in the feeding apparatus as well as in the endocrine organ of the larva, the ring gland. The octopaminergic neuronal population consists of both interneurons and efferent neurons. In the larval CNS all OA immunoreactive somata are localized in the midline of the ventral ganglion while in the adult CNS both unpaired neurons and bilateral clusters of immunoreactive cells are observed. One target of OA innervation is the abdominal muscles of the larval body wall where OA immunoreactivity is associated with the type II boutons in the axonal terminals. Histamine is mainly found in all photoreceptor cells where it is considered to be the major neurotransmitter molecule, and in specific mechanosensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system. Similarities between specific aminergic neurons and innervation sites in Drosophila and in other insect species are discussed. In addition, studies on the development and differentiation of 5HT and DA neurons are reviewed and data on the localization of 5HT, DA, and OA receptors are included as well. Finally, an overview on the isolation of the genes and the mutations in the amine biosynthetic pathways is presented and the implications of the molecular genetic approach in Drosophila are discussed.",1999,"M Monastirioti, M Monastirioti"
A gene responsible for a cuticular hydrocarbon polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster,10425916,10.1017/s0016672398003723,"Drosophila melanogaster is polymorphic for the major cuticular hydrocarbon of females. In most populations this hydrocarbon is 7,11-heptacosadiene, but females from Africa and the Caribbean usually possess low levels of 7,11-heptacosadiene and high quantities of its position isomer 5,9-heptacosadiene. Genetic analysis shows that the difference between these two morphs is due to variation at a single segregating factor located on the right arm of chromosome 3 near map position 51.5 and cytological position 87C-D. This is precisely the position of a desaturase gene previously sequenced using primers derived from yeast and mouse, and localized by in situ hybridization to the polytene chromosomes of D. melanogaster. Alleles of this desaturase gene may therefore be responsible for producing the two hydrocarbon morphs. Mating tests following the transfer of these isomers between females of the two morphs show that, in contrast to previous studies, the hydrocarbon profiles have no detectable effect on mating behaviour or sexual isolation.",1999,"J A Coyne, C Wicker-Thomas, J M Jallon, J A Coyne, C Wicker-Thomas, J M Jallon"
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the SNF4/AMPK gamma subunit gene from Drosophila melanogaster,10659773,10.1139/gen-42-6-1077,"To optimize gene expression under different environmental conditions, many organisms have evolved systems which can quickly up- and down-regulate the activity of other genes. Recently, the SNF1 kinase complex from yeast and the AMP-activated protein kinase complex from mammals have been shown to represent homologous metabolic sensors that are key to regulating energy levels under times of metabolic stress. Using heterologous probing, we have cloned the Drosophila melanogaster homologue of SNF4, the noncatalytic effector subunit from this kinase complex. A sequence corresponding to the partial genomic sequence as well as the full-length cDNA was obtained, and shows that the D. melanogaster SNF4 is encoded in a 1944-bp cDNA representing a protein of 648 amino acids (aa). Southern analysis of Drosophila genomic DNA in concert with a survey of mammalian SNF4 ESTs indicates that in metazoans, SNF4 is a duplicated gene, and possibly even a larger gene family. We propose that one gene copy codes for a short (330 aa) protein, whereas the second locus codes for a longer version (<410 aa) that is extended at the carboxy terminus, as typified by the Drosophila homologue presented here. Phylogenetic analysis of yeast, invertebrate, and multiple mammalian isoforms of SNF4 shows that the gene duplication likely occurred early in the metazoan lineage, as the protein products of the different loci are relatively divergent. When the phylogeny was extended beyond the SNF4 gene family, SNF4 shares sequence similarity with other cystathionine-beta-synthase domain-containing proteins, including IMP dehydrogenase and a variety of uncharacterized Methanococcus proteins.",1999,"E N Yoshida, B F Benkel, Y Fong, D A Hickey, E N Yoshida, B F Benkel, Y Fong, D A Hickey"
An analysis of polygenes affecting wing shape on chromosome 3 in Drosophila melanogaster,10511557,,"Loci on the third chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster that affect an index of wing shape were mapped, using recombinant isogenic lines, with transposable elements as markers. Many genes with small subequal effects are dispersed along the whole chromosome. Their alleles act nearly additively in heterozygotes. They have small correlated effects on leg shape, but no detectable effects on halteres. Small negative net interactions occur over most of the chromosome. The data set of 519 recombinant isogenic lines can be explained reasonably well by two models. One model posits an indefinitely large number of loci with no interactions. The other model posits 11 loci with additive effects whose sum equals the total phenotypic range and with large positive and negative interactions that nearly cancel each other.",1999,"K Weber, R Eisman, L Morey, A Patty, J Sparks, M Tausek, Z B Zeng, K Weber, R Eisman, L Morey, A Patty, J Sparks, M Tausek, Z B Zeng"
Persistence of eclosion rhythm in Drosophila melanogaster after 600 generations in an aperiodic environment,10501695,10.1007/s001140050651,"The ubiquity of circadian rhythms suggests that they have an intrinsic adaptive value (Ouyang et al. 1998; Ronneberg and Foster 1997). Some experiments have shown that organisms have enhanced longevity, development time or growth rates when maintained in environments whose periodicity closely matches their endogenous period (Aschoff et al. 1971; Highkin and Hanson 1954; Hillman 1956; Pittendrigh and Minis 1972; Went 1960). So far there has been no experimental evidence to show that circadian rhythms per se (i.e. periodicity itself, as opposed to phasing properties of a rhythm) confer a fitness advantage. We show that the circadian eclosion rhythm persists in a population of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster maintained in constant conditions of light, temperature, and humidity for over 600 generations. The results suggest that even in the absence of any environmental cycle there exists some intrinsic fitness value of circadian rhythms.",1999,"V Sheeba, V K Sharma, M K Chandrashekaran, A Joshi, V Sheeba, V K Sharma, M K Chandrashekaran, A Joshi"
Phosphorylation of the major Drosophila lamin in vivo: site identification during both M-phase (meiosis) and interphase by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry,10194384,10.1021/bi9827060,"Phosphorylation can have profound effects on the properties of nuclear lamins. For instance, phosphorylation of specific sites on mammalian lamins drastically alters their propensity to polymerize. Relatively little is known about the effects of phosphorylation during interphase and about phosphorylation of invertebrate nuclear lamins. Here, using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, we determined the phosphorylation sites of both interphase and M-phase isoforms of nuclear lamin Dm from Drosophila melanogaster. Interphase lamins are phosphorylated at three sites: two of these sites (Ser25 and a site located between residues 430 and 438) flank the alpha-helical rod domain, whereas the third site (Ser595) is located close to the C-terminus. The M-phase lamin isoform is phosphorylated predominantly at Ser45, a residue contained within a sequence matching the consensus site for phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase. Our study confirms the important role in vivo for cdc2 kinase in M-phase disassembly of nuclear lamins and provides the basis for understanding Drosophila lamin phosphorylation during interphase.",1999,"U Schneider, T Mini, P JenÃ¶, P A Fisher, N Stuurman, U Schneider, T Mini, P JenÃ¶, P A Fisher, N Stuurman"

Molecular analysis of mutants obtained by treatment with alkylating agents in a quadruplicated white-ivory strain of Drosophila melanogaster,10229920,10.1093/mutage/14.2.187,"The use of a white-ivory (wi) strain of Drosophila melanogaster carrying four copies of this allele, (wi)4, has proved to be useful in detecting somatic mutation in genotoxicity testing. Nevertheless, until now very little information exists about the nature of the genetic effects detected in such a strain. This work presents molecular data on the changes that have taken place in different germinal mutants obtained after treatment with alkylating agents. Three different phenotypes were obtained: wild-type red eyes, dark red eyes and eyes lighter than (wi)4. Our results show that, in at least one of the four copies of the allele, the wild-type red eye phenotypes are due to a precise excision of the 2.96 kb duplicated region characteristic of the wi allele. These data agree with previous results obtained in a strain carrying only a single copy of the wi allele. The dark red eye mutants analysed seemed to be generated as a cluster and all proved to be caused by deletions at the 3'-end of the duplicated wi region in two of the copies of the (wi)4 genome. Finally, the light eye mutants (obtained at high frequencies) failed to show alterations at the molecular level, although we cannot discard the possibility that they might have originated by the loss of some of the wi copies of the (wi)4 strain.",1999,"S SuÃ¡rez, O CabrÃ©, A VelÃ¡zquez, R Marcos, N Xamena, S SuÃ¡rez, O CabrÃ©, A VelÃ¡zquez, R Marcos, N Xamena"

The probes were chosen in order to cover all the autosomes, since X-chromosome homologies have already been studied by linkage analysis of morphological mutants. Most probes gave a unique hybridization signal; consequently, our results allow unambiguous inferences about chromosomal homologies.

bloated tubules (blot) encodes a Drosophila member of the neurotransmitter transporter family required for organisation of the apical cytocortex,10433833,10.1006/dbio.1999.9351,"We have identified a novel member of the vertebrate sodium- and chloride-dependent neurotransmitter symporter family from Drosophila melanogaster. This gene, named bloated tubules (blot), shows significant sequence similarity to a subgroup of vertebrate orphan transporters. blot transcripts are maternally supplied and during embryogenesis exhibit a complex and dynamic pattern in a subset of ectodermally derived epithelia, notably in the Malpighian tubules, and in the nervous system. Animals mutant for this gene are larval lethals, in which the Malpighian tubule cells are distended with an enlarged and disorganised apical surface. Embryos lacking the maternal component of blot expression die during early stages of development. They show an inability to form actin filaments in the apical cortex, resulting in impaired syncytial nuclear divisions, severe defects in the organisation of the cortical cytoskeleton, and a failure to cellularise. For the first time, a neurotransmitter transporter-like protein has been implicated in a function outside the nervous system.

The Drosophila heat shock hsr-omega gene: an allele frequency cline detected by quantitative PCR,10555288,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026069,"The hsr-omega gene of Drosophila melanogaster produces RNA products both constitutively and at elevated levels in response to heat stress. A single-nucleotide difference in this gene that has been detected using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) is responsible for an hsr-omegaa/b polymorphism, and selection experiments have indicated an association between the hsr-omegaa allele and susceptibility to heat stress. Since allele frequency estimates for population surveys using PCR and DGGE for single flies would be relatively time-consuming and expensive, we here develop a quantitative competitive-PCR method using mass-grind genomic DNA preparations for this purpose. Geographical and temporal variation of allele frequency at the hsr-omega locus in Australian populations of D. melanogaster are examined. Regular samples from a southern population through a summer season suggested stability of hsr-omegaa frequency. Field populations sampled from a approximately 2,250 km north-south transect along eastern Australia revealed a strong positive association between the frequency of hsr-omegaa and latitude, and marked spatial autocorrelation. Using appropriate analyses, strong association between population differences in hsr-omegaa frequencies and differences in temperature and rainfall measures, after controlling for latitudinal differences, support the idea that the cline in hsr-omegaa frequency may be attributable to some form of climatic selection.",1999,"G McColl, S W McKechnie, G McColl, S W McKechnie"
Adaptive evolution drives divergence of a hybrid inviability gene between two species of Drosophila,12802326,10.1038/nature01679,"Speciation--the splitting of one species into two--occurs by the evolution of any of several forms of reproductive isolation between taxa, including the intrinsic sterility and inviability of hybrids. Abundant evidence shows that these hybrid fitness problems are caused by incompatible interactions between loci: new alleles that become established in one species are sometimes functionally incompatible with alleles at interacting loci from another species. However, almost nothing is known about the genes involved in such hybrid incompatibilities or the evolutionary forces that drive their divergence. Here we identify a gene that causes epistatic inviability in hybrids between two fruitfly species, Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. Our population genetic analysis reveals that this gene--which encodes a nuclear pore protein--evolved by positive natural selection in both species' lineages. These results show that a lethal hybrid incompatibility has evolved as a by-product of adaptive protein evolution.",2003,"Daven C Presgraves, Lakshmi Balagopalan, Susan M Abmayr, H Allen Orr, Daven C Presgraves, Lakshmi Balagopalan, Susan M Abmayr, H Allen Orr"
"Identification and analysis of mutations in bob, Doa and eight new genes required for oocyte specification and development in Drosophila melanogaster",12930750,,"The Drosophila oocyte develops from a cluster of 16 interconnected cells that derive from a common progenitor. One of these cells, the oocyte, arrests in meiosis. The other cells endoreplicate their DNA and produce mRNAs and proteins that they traffic to the oocyte along a polarized microtubule cytoskeleton shared by the entire cyst. Therefore, Drosophila oogenesis is an attractive system for the study of cell cycle control and cell polarity. We carried out a clonal screen on the right arm of chromosome 3 for female sterile mutations using the FLP-FRT-ovo(D) system to identify new genes required for early oogenesis. We identified alleles of oo18 RNA binding protein (orb) and Darkener of apricot (Doa), which had previously been shown to exhibit oogenesis defects. We also identified several lethal alleles of the male sterile mutant, bobble (bob). In addition, we identified eight new lethal complementation groups that exhibit early oogenesis phenotypes. We analyzed mutant clones to determine the aspects of oogenesis disrupted by each complementation group. We assayed for the production and development of egg chambers, localization of ORB to and within the oocyte, and proper execution of the nurse cell cycle (endoreplication of DNA) and the oocyte cell cycle (karyosome formation). Here we discuss the identification, mapping, and phenotypic characterization of these new genes: omelet, soft boiled, hard boiled, poached, fried, over easy, sunny side up, and benedict.",2003,"Jason Z Morris, Caryn Navarro, Ruth Lehmann, Jason Z Morris, Caryn Navarro, Ruth Lehmann"

Transvection at the end of the truncated chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster,12702682,,"The phenomenon of transvection is well known for the Drosophila yellow locus. Thus enhancers of a promoterless yellow locus in one homologous chromosome can activate the yellow promoter in the other chromosome where the enhancers are inactive or deleted. In this report, we examined the requirements for trans-activation of the yellow promoter at the end of the deficient chromosome. A number of truncated chromosomes ending in different areas of the yellow regulatory region were examined in combination with the promoterless y alleles. We found that trans-activation of the yellow promoter at the end of a deficient chromosome required approximately 6 kb of an additional upstream sequence. The nature of upstream sequences affected the strength of transvection: addition of gypsy sequences induced stronger trans-activation than addition of HeT-A or yellow sequences. Only the promoter proximal region (within -158 bp of the yellow transcription start) was essential for trans-activation; i.e., transvection did not require extensive homology in the yellow upstream region. Finally, the yellow enhancers located on the two pairing chromosomes could cooperatively activate one yellow promoter.",2003,"Mikhail Savitsky, Tatyana Kahn, Ekaterina Pomerantseva, Pavel Georgiev, Mikhail Savitsky, Tatyana Kahn, Ekaterina Pomerantseva, Pavel Georgiev"
"Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans rescue strains produce fit offspring, despite divergent centromere-specific histone alleles",12815450,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800275,"The interaction between rapidly evolving centromere sequences and conserved kinetochore machinery appears to be mediated by centromere-binding proteins. A recent theory proposes that the independent evolution of centromere-binding proteins in isolated populations may be a universal cause of speciation among eukaryotes. In Drosophila the centromere-specific histone, Cid (centromere identifier), shows extensive sequence divergence between D. melanogaster and the D. simulans clade, indicating that centromere machinery incompatibilities may indeed be involved in reproductive isolation and speciation. However, it is presently unclear whether the adaptive evolution of Cid was a cause of the divergence between these species, or merely a product of postspeciation adaptation in the separate lineages. Furthermore, the extent to which divergent centromere identifier proteins provide a barrier to reproduction remains unknown. Interestingly, a small number of rescue lines from both D. melanogaster and D. simulans can restore hybrid fitness. Through comparisons of cid sequence between nonrescue and rescue strains, we show that cid is not involved in restoring hybrid viability or female fertility. Further, we demonstrate that divergent cid alleles are not sufficient to cause inviability or female sterility in hybrid crosses. Our data do not dispute the rapid divergence of cid or the coevolution of centromeric components in Drosophila; however, they do suggest that cid underwent adaptive evolution after D. melanogaster and D. simulans diverged and, consequently, is not a speciation gene.",2003,"A Sainz, J A Wilder, M Wolf, H Hollocher"
Variation in adult life history and stress resistance across five species of Drosophila,15133195,10.1007/BF02715818,"Dry weight at eclosion, adult lifespan, lifetime fecundity, lipid and carbohydrate content at eclosion, and starvation and desiccation resistance at eclosion were assayed on a long-term laboratory population of Drosophila melanogaster, and one recently wild-caught population each of four other species of Drosophila, two from the melanogaster and two from the immigrans species group. The relationships among trait means across the five species did not conform to expectations based on correlations among these traits inferred from selection studies on D. melanogaster. In particular, the expected positive relationships between fecundity and size/lipid content, lipid content and starvation resistance, carbohydrate (glycogen) content and desiccation resistance, and the expected negative relationship between lifespan and fecundity were not observed. Most traits were strongly positively correlated between sexes across species, except for fractional lipid content and starvation resistance per microgram lipid. For most traits, there was evidence for significant sexual dimorphism but the degree of dimorphism did not vary across species except in the case of adult lifespan, starvation resistance per microgram lipid, and desiccation resistance per microgram carbohydrate. Overall, D. nasuta nasuta and D. sulfurigaster neonasuta (immigrans group) were heavier at eclosion than the melanogaster group species, and tended to have somewhat higher absolute lipid content and starvation resistance. Yet, these two immigrans group species were shorter-lived and had lower average daily fecundity than the melanogaster group species. The smallest species, D. malerkotliana (melanogaster group), had relatively high daily fecundity, intermediate lifespan and high fractional lipid content, especially in females. D. ananassae (melanogaster group) had the highest absolute and fractional carbohydrate content, but its desiccation resistance per microgram carbohydrate was the lowest among the five species. In terms of overall performance, the laboratory population of D. melanogaster was clearly superior, under laboratory conditions, to the other four species if adult lifespan, lifetime fecundity, average daily fecundity, and absolute starvation and desiccation resistance are considered. This finding is contrary to several recent reports of substantially higher adult lifespan and stress resistance in recently wild-caught flies, relative to flies maintained for a long time in discrete-generation laboratory cultures. Possible explanations for these apparent anomalies are discussed in the context of the differing selection pressures likely to be experienced by Drosophila populations in laboratory versus wild environments.",2003,"N Sharmila Bharathi, N G Prasad, Mallikarjun Shakarad, Amitabh Joshi, N Sharmila Bharathi, N G Prasad, Mallikarjun Shakarad, Amitabh Joshi"

Drosophila E-cadherin is essential for proper germ cell-soma interaction during gonad morphogenesis,12900457,10.1242/dev.00639,"In most animal species, germ cells require intimate contact with specialized somatic cells in the gonad for their proper development. We have analyzed the establishment of germ cell-soma interaction during embryonic gonad formation in Drosophila melanogaster, and find that somatic cells undergo dramatic changes in cell shape and individually ensheath germ cells as the gonad coalesces. Germ cell ensheathment is independent of other aspects of gonad formation, indicating that separate morphogenic processes are at work during gonadogenesis. The cell-cell adhesion molecule Drosophila E-cadherin is essential both for germ cell ensheathment and gonad compaction, and is upregulated in the somatic gonad at the time of gonad formation. Our data indicate that differential cell adhesion contributes to cell sorting and the formation of proper gonad architecture. In addition, we find that Fear of Intimacy, a novel transmembrane protein, is also required for both germ cell ensheathment and gonad compaction. E-cadherin expression in the gonad is dramatically decreased in fear of intimacy mutants, indicating that Fear of Intimacy may be a regulator of E-cadherin expression or function.",2003,"Allison B Jenkins, J Michael McCaffery, Mark Van Doren, Allison B Jenkins, J Michael McCaffery, Mark Van Doren"
The genetics of mating recognition between Drosophila simulans and D. sechellia,14768896,10.1017/s0016672303006360,"During courtship, visual and chemical signals are often exchanged between the sexes. The proper exchange of such signals ensures intraspecific recognition. We have examined the genetic basis of interspecific differences in male mating behaviour and pheromone concentration between Drosophila simulans and D. sechellia by using Drosophila simulans/D. sechellia introgression lines. Our results show a majority of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) explaining variation in both male mating behaviour and pheromone concentration to be located on the third chromosome. One QTL found on the third chromosome explains variation in time needed to start courtship and copulation as well as time spent courting. The position of such QTL (approximately 84A-88B) with effects on courtship and copulation aspects of mating includes the candidate sex determination gene doublesex (84E5-6) and Voila (86E1-2), a gene that affects male courtship in D. melanogaster. One additional third chromosome QTL explained variation in 7-tricosene pheromone concentrations among males. The interval mapping position of this QTL (approximately 68E-76E) did not overlap with the position detected for differences in mating behaviour and the intervals did not include candidate genes previously identified as having an effect on D. melanogaster cuticular hydrocarbon production.

t(11;19)(q21;p13) translocation in mucoepidermoid carcinoma creates a novel fusion product that disrupts a Notch signaling pathway,12539049,10.1038/ng1083,"Truncation of Notch1 has been shown to cause a subtype of acute leukemia, and activation of Notch4 has been associated with mammary and salivary gland carcinomas of mice. Here we identify a new mechanism for disrupting Notch signaling in human tumorigenesis, characterized by altered function of a new ortholog of the Drosophila melanogaster Notch co-activator molecule Mastermind. We cloned the t(11;19) translocation that underlies the most common type of human malignant salivary gland tumor. This rearrangement fuses exon 1 from a novel gene of unknown function at 19p13, termed mucoepidermoid carcinoma translocated 1 (MECT1), with exons 2-5 of a novel member of the Mastermind-like gene family (MAML2) at 11q21 (ref. 3). Similar to D. melanogaster Mastermind and MAML1 (refs. 4,5), full-length MAML2 functioned as a CSL (CBF-1, suppressor of hairless and Lag-1)-dependent transcriptional co-activator for ligand-stimulated Notch. In contrast, MECT1-MAML2 activated transcription of the Notch target gene HES1 independently of both Notch ligand and CSL binding sites. MECT1-MAML2 induced foci formation in RK3E epithelial cells, confirming a biological effect for the fusion product.

JNK signaling confers tolerance to oxidative stress and extends lifespan in Drosophila,14602080,10.1016/s1534-5807(03)00323-x,"Changes in the genetic makeup of an organism can extend lifespan significantly if they promote tolerance to environmental insults and thus prevent the general deterioration of cellular function that is associated with aging. Here, we introduce the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway as a genetic determinant of aging in Drosophila melanogaster. Based on expression profiling experiments, we demonstrate that JNK functions at the center of a signal transduction network that coordinates the induction of protective genes in response to oxidative challenge. JNK signaling activity thus alleviates the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, we show that flies with mutations that augment JNK signaling accumulate less oxidative damage and live dramatically longer than wild-type flies. Our work thus identifies the evolutionarily conserved JNK signaling pathway as a major genetic factor in the control of longevity.",2003,"Meng C Wang, Dirk Bohmann, Heinrich Jasper, Meng C Wang, Dirk Bohmann, Heinrich Jasper"
Variable effects of vitamin E on Drosophila longevity,12766533,10.1023/a:1023347803932,"Vitamin E has been used widely in invertebrate experiments where it usually acts to prolong life span. Conversely in vertebrates it has been less successful. In some cases, experiments in rodents show no effect of vitamin E on longevity. Consequently, the suggestion has been made that anti-oxidants do not effect ageing in vertebrates. In more extensive experiments with Drosophila melanogaster, vitamin E exerted both life span extending and toxic effects. At 20 micro g/ml, the life span was increased by 16%, although there was no effect at higher or lower concentrations. At 200 micro g/ml, vitamin E protected Drosophila against paraquat toxicity. At this concentration, vitamin E had no effect on longevity in one set of experiments, and shortened the life span in another set. Apparent toxicity of vitamin E was also observed in behavior experiments. We suggest that inactivity of vitamin E that has been reported by some authors is due to antagonistic actions of a toxic effect and a beneficial anti-oxidant action. This complex response to vitamin E will limit its use for clinical and investigative work on ageing.",2003,"Christopher Driver, Angela Georgeou, Christopher Driver, Angela Georgeou"

PCR-based genotyping of individual embryos and larvae show that this phenotype occurs in the trisomics after hatching and in the monosomics before hatching. Weak alleles of the interacting gene Su(Tpl) delay the death of Tpl trisomics, but they still show the same tracheal and midgut phenotypes before dying. Hyperoxia (45% oxygen) partially suppresses the phenotype of Tpl aneuploids, even though the use of a hypoxia reporter strain shows that dying Tpl aneuploids are not hypoxic.

The CBP and p300 proteins are transcriptional co-activators that interact with a multitude of transcription factors, including Myb. In transient transfection assays, transcriptional activation by DMyb is enhanced by co-expression of the Drosophila CBP protein, dCBP.

Sex-peptide is the molecular basis of the sperm effect in Drosophila melanogaster,12897240,10.1073/pnas.1631700100,"Mating elicits two major changes in the reproductive behavior of many insect females. The egg-laying rate increases and the readiness to accept males (receptivity) is reduced. These postmating responses last approximately 1 week in Drosophila melanogaster. Males that do not transfer sperm but transfer seminal fluid during mating induce a short-term response of 1 day. The long-term response of 1 week requires the presence of sperm (sperm effect). Hence, sperm is essential for the long-term persistence of the postmating responses. Three seminal fluid peptides elicit postmating responses: ovulin, sex-peptide (SP), and DUP99B. Using the technique of targeted mutagenesis by homologous recombination, we have produced males with mutant SP genes. Here, we report that males lacking functional SP elicit only a weak short-term response. However, these males do transfer sperm. Thus, (i) SP is the major agent eliciting the short-term and the long-term postmating responses and (ii) sperm is merely the carrier for SP. The second conclusion is supported by the finding that SP binds to sperm.

The mushroom bodies of Drosophila melanogaster: an immunocytological and golgi study of Kenyon cell organization in the calyces and lobes,12966500,10.1002/jemt.10368,"Golgi impregnations reveal a variety of dendritic morphologies amongst Kenyon cells in the mushroom bodies of Drosophila melanogaster. Different morphological types of Kenyon cells contribute axon-like processes to five divisions of the medial and vertical lobes. Four of these divisions have characteristic affinities to antibodies raised against aspartate, glutamate, and taurine. A newly described posterior subdivision of the medial lobe, here named the betac lobe with its vertical branch alphac, comprises glutamatergic Kenyon cells that are probably homologous to glutamatergic Kenyon cells in the cockroach and honey bee, and are the last neurons to differentiate. The first neurons to differentiate, which supply the gamma lobe, are equipped with clawed dendritic specializations and are the structural homologues of clawed class II Kenyon cells supplying the gamma lobes in cockroaches and honey bees. Three intermediate divisions lie between the betac lobe and gamma lobe. These are, from the back towards the front, the beta lobe, the beta' lobe, and a narrow division between beta' and gamma called the beta"" lobe. The fused calyx of the Drosophila mushroom body is comparable to the double calyces of Hymenoptera, here exemplified by a basal taxon, Diprion pini. Further similarities between the hymenopteran calyces and those of Drosophila are suggested by the segregation of different types of Kenyon cell dendrites within the calyx neuropil. The organization of afferents from the antennal lobes also defines regions in the Drosophila calyx that may be homologous to the lip and basal ring regions of the honey bee calyces.

Gene vector and transposable element behavior in mosquitoes,14506218,10.1242/jeb.00638,"The development of efficient germ-line transformation technologies for mosquitoes has increased the ability of entomologists to find, isolate and analyze genes. The utility of the currently available systems will be determined by a number of factors including the behavior of the gene vectors during the initial integration event and their behavior after chromosomal integration. Post-integration behavior will determine whether the transposable elements being employed currently as primary gene vectors will be useful as gene-tagging and enhancer-trapping agents. The post-integration behavior of existing insect vectors has not been extensively examined. Mos1 is useful as a primary germ-line transformation vector in insects but is inefficiently remobilized in Drosophila melanogaster and Aedes aegypti. Hermes transforms D. melanogaster efficiently and can be remobilized in this species. This element is also useful for creating transgenic A. aegypti, but its mode of integration in mosquitoes results in the insertion of flanking plasmid DNA. Hermes can be remobilized in the soma of A. aegypti and transposes using a common cut-and-paste mechanism; however, the element does not remobilize in the germ line. piggyBac can be used to create transgenic mosquitoes and occasionally integrates using a mechanism other than a simple cut-and-paste mechanism.

When coexpressed in COS cells, CG9342 promoted the assembly and secretion of apoB34 and apoB41 (N-terminal 34 and 41% of human apoB). The apoB34-containing particles assembled by human MTP and CG9342 displayed similar peak densities of approximately 1.169 g/ml and similar lipid compositions. However, CG9342 displayed differential sensitivities to two inhibitors of human MTP and low vesicle-based lipid transfer activity, in vitro. In addition, important predicted structural distinctions exist between the human and Drosophila proteins suggesting overlapping but not identical functional roles. We conclude that CG9342 and human MTP are orthologs that share only a subset of functions, consistent with known differences in intracellular and extracellular aspects of vertebrate and invertebrate lipid transport and metabolism.",2003,"Jeremy A Sellers, Li Hou, Humra Athar, M Mahmood Hussain, Gregory S Shelness, Jeremy A Sellers, Li Hou, Humra Athar, M Mahmood Hussain, Gregory S Shelness"
Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by Drosophila mitochondria,14556858,10.1016/s0891-5849(03)00464-7,"Drosophila melanogaster is a key model organism for genetic investigation of the role of free radicals in aging, but biochemical understanding is lacking. Superoxide production by Drosophila mitochondria was measured fluorometrically as hydrogen peroxide, using its dependence on substrates, inhibitors, and added superoxide dismutase to determine sites of production and their topology. Glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and center o of complex III in the presence of antimycin had the greatest maximum capacities to generate superoxide on the cytosolic side of the inner membrane. Complex I had significant capacity on the matrix side. Center i of complex III, cytochrome c, and complex IV produced no superoxide. Native superoxide generation by isolated mitochondria was also measured without added inhibitors. There was a high rate of superoxide production with sn-glycerol 3-phosphate as substrate; two-thirds mostly from glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase on the cytosolic side and one-third on the matrix side from complex I following reverse electron transport. There was little superoxide production from any site with NADH-linked substrate. Superoxide production by complex I following reverse electron flow from glycerol 3-phosphate was particularly sensitive to membrane potential, decreasing 70% when potential decreased 10 mV, showing that mild uncoupling lowers superoxide production in the matrix very effectively.",2003,"Satomi Miwa, Julie St-Pierre, Linda Partridge, Martin D Brand, Satomi Miwa, Julie St-Pierre, Linda Partridge, Martin D Brand"
Transposon telomeres are widely distributed in the Drosophila genus: TART elements in the virilis group,12626755,10.1073/pnas.0230353100,"Telomeres of most animals, plants, and unicellular eukaryotes are made up of tandem arrays of repeated DNA sequences produced by the enzyme telomerase. Drosophila melanogaster has an unusual variation on this theme; telomeres consist of tandem arrays of sequences produced by successive transpositions of two non-LTR retrotransposons, HeT-A and TART. To explore the phylogenetic distribution of these variant telomeres, we have looked for TART homologues in a distantly related Drosophila species, virilis. We have found elements that, despite many differences in nucleotide sequence, retain significant amino acid similarity to TART from D. melanogaster. These D. virilis TART elements have features that characterize TART elements in D. melanogaster: (i) they are found in tandem arrays on chromosome ends, (ii) they are not found in euchromatin, and (iii) they produce both sense and antisense transcripts, with the antisense RNA being in excess. The D. virilis TART elements have one surprising feature: both of the ORFs contain long stretches of the trinucleotide repeat CAX, encoding polyglutamine (with a few interspersed histidines). These long polyglutamine stretches are conserved in the three D. virilis elements sequenced. They do not interrupt any domains of known function in the TART proteins and are not seen in TART proteins from other species. Comparison of the D. virilis and D. melanogaster telomeres suggests that the retrotransposon mechanism of telomere maintenance may have arisen before the separation of the genus Drosophila.",2003,"Elena Casacuberta, Mary-Lou Pardue"
"COM, a heterochromatic locus governing the control of independent endogenous retroviruses from Drosophila melanogaster",12807771,,"ZAM and Idefix are two endogenous retroviruses whose expression is tightly controlled in Drosophila melanogaster. However, a line exists in which this control has been perturbed, resulting in a high mobilization rate for both retroviruses. This line is called the U (unstable) line as opposed to the other S (stable) lines. In the process of analyzing this control and tracing the genetic determinant involved, we found that ZAM and Idefix expression responded to two types of controls: one restricting their expression to specific somatic cells in the ovaries and the other silencing their expression in S lines but permitting it in U lines. While studying this second control in the U or S backgrounds, we found that the heterochromatic locus 20A2-3 on the X chromosome, previously implicated in the regulation of a third retroelement, gypsy, also controlled both ZAM and Idefix. We report here that genetic determinants necessary for endogenous retrovirus silencing occur at the 20A2-3 locus, which we call COM, for centre organisateur de mobilisation. We propose that if this point of control becomes mutated during the life of the fly, it may trigger processes reactivating dormant endogenous retroviruses and thus bring about sudden bursts of mobilization.",2003,"Sophie Desset, Carine Meignin, Bernard Dastugue, Chantal Vaury, Sophie Desset, Carine Meignin, Bernard Dastugue, Chantal Vaury"
Genetic basis of male sexual behavior,12486700,10.1002/neu.10163,Male sexual behavior is increasingly the focus of genetic study in a variety of animals. Genetic analysis in the soil roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has lead to identification of genes and circuits that govern behaviors ranging from motivation and mate-searching to courtship and copulation. Some worm and fly genes have counterparts with related functions in higher animals and many more such correspondences can be expected. Analysis of mutations in mammals can potentially lead to insights into such issues as monogamous versus promiscuous sexual behavior and sexual orientation. Genetic analysis of sexual behavior has implications for understanding how the nervous system generates and controls a complex behavior. It can also help us to gain an appreciation of how behavior is encoded by genes and their regulatory sequences.,2003,"Scott W Emmons, Jonathan Lipton, Scott W Emmons, Jonathan Lipton"

It is proposed that a delay in pairing of the pericentromeric heterochromatic chromosome regions combined into a single chromocenter leads to the following: (1) formation of the heteroduplex structures (X structures) takes more time and, consequently, their number and the frequency of crossing over in the paired chromosome regions increases; (2) in nonhomologous chromosomes, the chromocentral connections, which normally degrade in prometaphase, are retained to fulfill a function of coorientation during the first meiotic division.",2003,"V L Chubykin, V L Chubykin"

In this study, we used high resolution light microscopy, electron microscopy, and intravital imaging to analyze the function of BRP in AZ assembly. Consistent with truncated BRP variants forming shortened T-bars, we identify BRP as a direct T-bar component at the AZ center with its N terminus closer to the AZ membrane than its C terminus. In contrast, Drosophila Liprin-alpha, another AZ-organizing protein, precedes BRP during the assembly of newly forming AZs by several hours and surrounds the AZ center in few discrete punctae.

A small number of additional proteins have recently been identified as potential duplication factors, but it is unclear whether any of these proteins are components of the core duplication machinery. In this study, we investigate the function of one of these proteins, Drosophila melanogaster Ana3. We show that Ana3 is present in centrioles and basal bodies, but its behavior is distinct from that of the core duplication proteins. Most importantly, we find that Ana3 is required for the structural integrity of both centrioles and basal bodies and for centriole cohesion, but it is not essential for centriole duplication. We show that Ana3 has a mammalian homologue, Rotatin, that also localizes to centrioles and basal bodies and appears to be essential for cilia function.

Many of these studies have pointed to the importance of cis-regulatory modules, genetic sequences that direct the temporal and spatial patterns of gene expression over large genomic distances.

The tyrosine kinase Stitcher activates Grainy head and epidermal wound healing in Drosophila,19525935,10.1038/ncb1898,"Epidermal injury initiates a cascade of inflammation, epithelial remodelling and integument repair at wound sites. The regeneration of the extracellular barrier and damaged tissue repair rely on the precise orchestration of epithelial responses triggered by the injury.

However, the activation mechanisms and functions of Grh factors in re-epithelialization remain unknown. Here we identify stitcher (stit), a new Grh target in Drosophila melanogaster. stit encodes a Ret-family receptor tyrosine kinase required for efficient epidermal wound healing. Live imaging analysis reveals that Stit promotes actin cable assembly during wound re-epithelialization. Stit activation also induces extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation along with the Grh-dependent expression of stit and barrier repair genes at the wound sites. The transcriptional stimulation of stit on injury triggers a positive feedback loop increasing the magnitude of epithelial responses.

Much of this work makes predictions about how potential hosts should invest in overall immunity.

Here, we investigate these aspects by examining gene regulation across several immune system components in both male and female Drosophila melanogaster prior to and after mating. To elucidate potentially important temporal dynamics, we also assayed several genes over time. We found that males and females emphasized different components of their immune system, however overall investment was similar. Specifically, the sexes emphasized different gene paralogues within major gene families, and males tended to invest more in gram-negative defence. By contrast, the inducibility of the immune response was both transient (lasting approx. 24 hours) and equal between the sexes. Furthermore, mating tended to induce humoral gene upregulation, while cell-mediated genes were unaffected. Within the humoral system, gram-negative bacterial defence genes exhibited a greater inducibility than those associated with fungal or gram-positive bacterial defence. Our results suggest that variation in the effectiveness of the immune response between the sexes may be driven by differences in emphasis rather than overall investment.",2009,"Wade E Winterhalter, Kenneth M Fedorka, Wade E Winterhalter, Kenneth M Fedorka"

      Transcription initiation is a key component in the regulation of gene expression. mRNA 5' full-length sequencing techniques have enhanced our understanding of mammalian transcription start sites (TSSs), revealing different initiation patterns on a genomic scale.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      To identify TSSs in Drosophila melanogaster, we applied a hierarchical clustering strategy on available 5' expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and identified a high quality set of 5,665 TSSs for approximately 4,000 genes. We distinguished two initiation patterns: 'peaked' TSSs, and 'broad' TSS cluster groups. Peaked promoters were found to contain location-specific sequence elements; conversely, broad promoters were associated with non-location-specific elements. In alignments across other Drosophila genomes, conservation levels of sequence elements exceeded 90% within the melanogaster subgroup, but dropped considerably for distal species. Elements in broad promoters had lower levels of conservation than those in peaked promoters. When characterizing the distributions of ESTs, 64% of TSSs showed distinct associations to one out of eight different spatiotemporal conditions. Available whole-genome tiling array time series data revealed different temporal patterns of embryonic activity across the majority of genes with distinct alternative promoters. Many genes with maternally inherited transcripts were found to have alternative promoters utilized later in development. Core promoters of maternally inherited transcripts showed differences in motif composition compared to zygotically active promoters.

Brain patterning defects caused by mutations of the twin of eyeless gene in Drosophila melanogaster,19901536,10.4161/fly.10385,"The Drosophila Pax6 genes, eyeless (ey) and twin of eyeless (toy), are expressed in both eyes and the brain.

However, the functional significance of toy in brain development is poorly understood. Here, we describe the expression patterns of TOY, and show that TOY expression partially overlaps with EY expression in the embryonic, larval and adult brains. Mutations of toy perturb brain neuromere formation in the embryonic stages, and result in severe deformation of the MB lobes in pharate adult brains. Moreover, we also analyzed toy functions by gain-of-function experiments, and show that overexpression of toy results in degeneration of MB lobes.

Recently completed genome sequences of different Wolbachia strains show that these bacteria may have the genetic machinery to influence iron utilization of hosts. Here we show that Wolbachia infection can confer a positive fecundity benefit for Drosophila melanogaster reared on iron-restricted or -overloaded diets.

In a screen for genetic variation affecting this process, we surveyed 96 wild-type lines of Drosophila melanogaster for polymorphisms in binding sites within 16 Bicoid cis-regulatory response elements. One common polymorphism in the orthodenticle (otd) early head enhancer is associated with a complex series of indels/substitutions that define two distinct haplotypes. The middle region of this enhancer exhibits an unusual pattern of nucleotide diversity that does not easily fit into standard models of selection and demography. Population Gene Expression Maps, generated by extracting binary expression profiles from normalized embryo images, revealed a ventral reduction of otd transcript abundance in one of the haplotypes that was recapitulated in expression of transgenic constructs containing the two alleles.

Determination of mechanical stress distribution in Drosophila wing discs using photoelasticity,19748573,10.1016/j.mod.2009.09.002,"Morphogenesis, the process by which all complex biological structures are formed, is driven by an intricate interplay between genes, growth, as well as intra- and intercellular forces. While the expression of different genes changes the mechanical properties and shapes of cells, growth exerts forces in response to which tissues, organs and more complex structures are shaped. This is exemplified by a number of recent findings for instance in meristem formation in Arabidopsis and tracheal tube formation in Drosophila. However, growth not only generates forces, mechanical forces can also have an effect on growth rates, as is seen in mammalian tissues or bone growth. In fact, mechanical forces can influence the expression levels of patterning genes, allowing control of morphogenesis via mechanical feedback. In order to study the connections between mechanical stress, growth control and morphogenesis, information about the distribution of stress in a tissue is invaluable. Here, we applied stress-birefringence to the wing imaginal disc of Drosophila melanogaster, a commonly used model system for organ growth and patterning, in order to assess the stress distribution present in this tissue. For this purpose, stress-related differences in retardance are measured using a custom-built optical set-up. Applying this method, we found that the stresses are inhomogeneously distributed in the wing disc, with maximum compression in the centre of the wing pouch. This compression increases with wing disc size, showing that mechanical forces vary with the age of the tissue. These results are discussed in light of recent models proposing mechanical regulation of wing disc growth.",2009,"Ulrike Nienhaus, Tinri Aegerter-Wilmsen, Christof M Aegerter, Ulrike Nienhaus, Tinri Aegerter-Wilmsen, Christof M Aegerter"
Genetic changes accompanying the evolution of host specialization in Drosophila sechellia,19033155,10.1534/genetics.108.093419,"Changes in host specialization contribute to the diversification of phytophagous insects. When shifting to a new host, insects evolve new physiological, morphological, and behavioral adaptations. Our understanding of the genetic changes responsible for these adaptations is limited. For instance, we do not know how often host shifts involve gain-of-function vs. loss-of-function alleles. Recent work suggests that some genes involved in odor recognition are lost in specialists. Here we show that genes involved in detoxification and metabolism, as well as those affecting olfaction, have reduced gene expression in Drosophila sechellia-a specialist on the fruit of Morinda citrifolia. We screened for genes that differ in expression between D. sechellia and its generalist sister species, D. simulans. We also screened for genes that are differentially expressed in D. sechellia when these flies chose their preferred host vs. when they were forced onto other food. D. sechellia increases expression of genes involved with oogenesis and fatty acid metabolism when on its host. The majority of differentially expressed genes, however, appear downregulated in D. sechellia. For several functionally related genes, this decrease in expression is associated with apparent loss-of-function alleles. For example, the D. sechellia allele of Odorant binding protein 56e (Obp56e) harbors a premature stop codon. We show that knockdown of Obp56e activity significantly reduces the avoidance response of D. melanogaster toward M. citrifolia. We argue that apparent loss-of-function alleles like Obp56e potentially contributed to the initial adaptation of D. sechellia to its host. Our results suggest that a subset of genes reduce or lose function as a consequence of host specialization, which may explain why, in general, specialist insects tend to shift to chemically similar hosts.",2009,"Ian Dworkin, Corbin D Jones, Ian Dworkin, Corbin D Jones"

Characterization of a lamellocyte transcriptional enhancer located within the misshapen gene of Drosophila melanogaster,19641625,10.1371/journal.pone.0006429,"Drosophila has emerged as an excellent model system in which to study cellular and genetic aspects of hematopoiesis. Under normal developmental conditions and in wild-type genetic backgrounds, Drosophila possesses two types of blood cells, crystal cells and plasmatocytes. Upon infestation by a parasitic wasp or in certain altered genetic backgrounds, a third hemocyte class called the lamellocyte becomes apparent. Herein we describe the characterization of a novel transcriptional regulatory module, a lamellocyte-active enhancer of the misshapen gene. This transcriptional control sequence appears to be inactive in all cell types of the wild-type larva, including crystal cells and plasmatocytes. However, in lamellocytes induced by wasp infestation or by particular genetic conditions, the enhancer is activated and it directs reporter GFP or DsRed expression exclusively in lamellocytes. The lamellocyte control region was delimited to a 140-bp intronic sequence that contains an essential DNA recognition element for the AP-1 transcription factor. Additionally, mutation of the kayak gene encoding the dFos subunit of AP-1 led to a strong suppression of lamellocyte production in tumorous larvae. As misshapen encodes a protein kinase within the Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway that functions to form an active AP-1 complex, the lamellocyte-active enhancer likely serves as a transcriptional target within a genetic auto-regulatory circuit that promotes the production of lamellocytes in immune-challenged or genetically-compromised animals.",2009,"Tsuyoshi Tokusumi, Richard Paul Sorrentino, Mark Russell, Roberto Ferrarese, Shubha Govind, Robert A Schulz, Tsuyoshi Tokusumi, Richard Paul Sorrentino, Mark Russell, Roberto Ferrarese, Shubha Govind, Robert A Schulz"

In this chapter, we present an overview of the research on the (co)evolutionary interaction between Drosophila and their parasitoids, with the main focus on the cellular immune response of D. melanogaster, and the counter-resistance mechanism of one of its main parasitoids, Asobara tabida. A key aspect of this interaction is the existence of genetic variation: in the field, host resistance and parasitoid counter-resistance vary, both between and within populations. Host resistance and parasitoid counter-resistance are costly, and both these costs turn out to be density dependent. These tradeoffs can explain the existence of genetic variation. We briefly touch upon behavioral aspects of the interaction and the parasites and pathogens that the parasitoids themselves suffer from. We end this chapter by considering the data coming from gene chip experiments: early indications suggest that the genes involved in the actual immune response against parasitoids are mostly different from the genes involved in the evolution of resistance.",2009,"Alex R Kraaijeveld, H Charles J Godfray, Alex R Kraaijeveld, H Charles J Godfray"
"Expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the N-terminal domain of GNBP3 from Drosophila melanogaster",19724120,10.1107/S1744309109014997,"Gram-negative bacteria-binding protein 3 (GNBP3) is a pattern-recognition receptor which contributes to the defensive response against fungal infection in Drosophila. The protein consists of an N-terminal domain, which is considered to recognize beta-glucans from the fungal cell wall, and a C-terminal domain, which is homologous to bacterial glucanases but devoid of activity. The N-terminal domain of GNBP3 (GNBP3-Nter) was successfully purified after expression in Drosophila S2 cells. Diffraction-quality crystals were produced by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method using PEG 2000 and PEG 8000 as precipitants. Preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the GNBP3-Nter crystals belonged to the monoclinic space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 134.79, b = 30.55, c = 51.73 A, beta = 107.4 degrees, and diffracted to 1.7 A using synchrotron radiation.

"A product of the bicistronic Drosophila melanogaster gene CG31241, which also encodes a trimethylguanosine synthase, plays a role in telomere protection",19240120,10.1242/jcs.035097,"Although telomere formation occurs through a different mechanism in Drosophila compared with other organisms, telomere associations result from mutations in homologous genes, indicating the involvement of similar pathways in chromosome end protection. We report here that mutations of the Drosophila melanogaster gene CG31241 lead to high frequency chromosome end fusions. CG31241 is a bicistronic gene that encodes trimethylguanosine synthase (TGS1), which forms the m3G caps of noncoding small RNAs, and a novel protein, DTL. We show that although TGS1 has no role in telomere protection, DTL is localized at specific sites, including the ends of polytene chromosomes, and its loss results in telomere associations. Mutations of ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase suppress telomere fusions in the absence of DTL. Thus, genetic interactions place DTL in an ATR-related pathway in telomere protection. In contrast to ATR kinase, mutations of ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) kinase, which acts in a partially overlapping pathway of telomere protection, do not suppress formation of telomere associations in the absence of DTL. Thus, uncovering the role of DTL will help to dissect the evolutionary conserved pathway(s) controlling ATM-ATR-related telomere protection.",2009,"Orban Komonyi, Tamas Schauer, Gabor Papai, Peter Deak, Imre M Boros, Orban Komonyi, Tamas Schauer, Gabor Papai, Peter Deak, Imre M Boros"
An Entry/Gateway cloning system for general expression of genes with molecular tags in Drosophila melanogaster,19178707,10.1186/1471-2121-10-8,"Background:
      
    

    
      Tagged fusion proteins are priceless tools for monitoring the activities of biomolecules in living cells. However, over-expression of fusion proteins sometimes leads to the unwanted lethality or developmental defects. Therefore, vectors that can express tagged proteins at physiological levels are desirable tools for studying dosage-sensitive proteins. We developed a set of Entry/Gateway vectors for expressing fluorescent fusion proteins in Drosophila melanogaster. The vectors were used to generate fluorescent CP190 which is a component of the gypsy chromatin insulator. We used the fluorescent CP190 to study the dynamic movement of related chromatin insulators in living cells.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The Entry/Gateway system is a timesaving technique for quickly generating expression constructs of tagged fusion proteins. We described in this study an Entry/Gateway based system, which includes six P-element destination vectors (P-DEST) for expressing tagged proteins (eGFP, mRFP, or myc) in Drosophila melanogaster and a TA-based cloning vector for generating entry clones from unstable DNA sequences. We used the P-DEST vectors to express fluorecent CP190 at tolerable levels. Expression of CP190 using the UAS/Gal4 system, instead, led to either lethality or underdeveloped tissues. The expressed eGFP- or mRFP-tagged CP190 proteins are fully functional and rescued the lethality of the homozygous CP190 mutation. We visualized a wide range of CP190 distribution patterns in living cell nuclei, from thousands of tiny particles to less than ten giant ones, which likely reflects diverse organization of higher-order chromatin structures. We also visualized the fusion of multiple smaller insulator bodies into larger aggregates in living cells, which is likely reflective of the dynamic activities of reorganization of chromatin in living nuclei.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We have developed an efficient cloning system for expressing dosage-sensitive proteins in Drosophila melanogaster. This system successfully expresses functional fluorescent CP190 fusion proteins. The fluorescent CP190 proteins exist in insulator bodies of various numbers and sizes among cells from multiple living tissues. Furthermore, live imaging of the movements of these fluorescent-tagged proteins suggests that the assembly and disassembly of insulator bodies are normal activities in living cells and may be directed for regulating transcription.",2009,"Omar S Akbari, Daniel Oliver, Katie Eyer, Chi-Yun Pai, Omar S Akbari, Daniel Oliver, Katie Eyer, Chi-Yun Pai"
Upregulation of the Drosophila Friend of GATA gene U-shaped by JAK/STAT signaling maintains lymph gland prohemocyte potency,19737914,10.1128/MCB.00244-09,"Studies using Drosophila melanogaster have contributed significantly to our understanding of the interaction between stem cells and their protective microenvironments or stem cell niches. During lymph gland hematopoiesis, the Drosophila posterior signaling center functions as a stem cell niche to maintain prohemocyte multipotency through Hedgehog and JAK/STAT signaling. In this study, we provide evidence that the Friend of GATA protein U-shaped is an important regulator of lymph gland prohemocyte potency and differentiation. U-shaped expression was determined to be upregulated in third-instar lymph gland prohemocytes and downregulated in a subpopulation of differentiating blood cells. Genetic analyses indicated that U-shaped maintains the prohemocyte population by blocking differentiation. In addition, activated STAT directly regulated ush expression as evidenced by results from loss- and gain-of-function studies and from analyses of the u-shaped hematopoietic cis-regulatory module. Collectively, these findings identify U-shaped as a downstream effector of the posterior signaling center, establishing a novel link between the stem cell niche and the intrinsic regulation of potency and differentiation. Given the functional conservation of Friend of GATA proteins and the role that GATA factors play during cell fate choice, these factors may regulate essential functions of vertebrate hematopoietic stem cells, including processing signals from the stem cell niche.",2009,"Hongjuan Gao, Xiaorong Wu, Nancy Fossett, Hongjuan Gao, Xiaorong Wu, Nancy Fossett"
Activation of insect phenoloxidase after injury: endogenous versus foreign elicitors,20375588,10.1159/000168009,"The enzyme phenoloxidase (PO) is one of the first immune molecules that was identified in invertebrates. Recently, the immune function of PO has been challenged. We tested how PO is activated following injury in 2 insects, i.e. the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the wax moth Galleria mellonella. Rapid PO activation in Drosophila was limited to discrete areas of the hemolymph clot which forms after injury. Surprisingly, unlike systemic PO activation during bacterial sepsis, clot melanization was not sensitive to microbial elicitors in our assay. Instead, Drosophila clot melanization was activated by endogenous signals such as apoptotic cells and was superinduced by phosphatidylserine, a negatively charged phospholipid normally found on the inner surface of the plasma membrane and exposed during apoptosis. In contrast, melanization in G. mellonella hemolymph was stronger and more uniform and was sensitive to peptidoglycan. This shows that both exogenous and endogenous signals can trigger the same immune mechanism in species- and context-dependent ways. Our findings have implications for the evolutionary dynamics of immune mechanisms and are in agreement with recent comparisons of insect immune transcriptomes.",2009,"Gawa Bidla, Thomas Hauling, Mitchell S Dushay, Ulrich Theopold, Gawa Bidla, Thomas Hauling, Mitchell S Dushay, Ulrich Theopold"
Molecular social interactions: Drosophila melanogaster seminal fluid proteins as a case study,20109658,10.1016/S0065-2660(09)68002-0,"Studies of social behavior generally focus on interactions between two or more individual animals. However, these interactions are not simply between whole animals, but also occur between molecules that were produced by the interacting individuals. Such ""molecular social interactions"" can both influence and be influenced by the organismal-level social interactions. We illustrate this by reviewing the roles played by seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) in molecular social interactions between males and females of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Sfps, which are produced by males and transferred to females during mating, are involved in inherently social interactions with female-derived molecules, and they influence social interactions between males and females and between a female's past and potential future mates. Here, we explore four examples of molecular social interactions involving D. melanogaster Sfps: processes that influence mating, sperm storage, ovulation, and ejaculate transfer. We consider the molecular and organismal players involved in each interaction and the consequences of their interplay for the reproductive success of both sexes. We conclude with a discussion of the ways in which Sfps can both shape and be shaped by (in an evolutionary sense) the molecular social interactions in which they are involved.",2009,"Laura K Sirot, Brooke A LaFlamme, Jessica L Sitnik, C Dustin Rubinstein, Frank W Avila, Clement Y Chow, Mariana F Wolfner, Laura K Sirot, Brooke A LaFlamme, Jessica L Sitnik, C Dustin Rubinstein, Frank W Avila, Clement Y Chow, Mariana F Wolfner"
Microinjection techniques for studying mitosis in the Drosophila melanogaster syncytial embryo,19755959,10.3791/1382,"This protocol describes the use of the Drosophila melanogaster syncytial embryo for studying mitosis. Drosophila has useful genetics with a sequenced genome, and it can be easily maintained and manipulated. Many mitotic mutants exist, and transgenic flies expressing functional fluorescently (e.g. GFP) - tagged mitotic proteins have been and are being generated. Targeted gene expression is possible using the GAL4/UAS system. The Drosophila early embryo carries out multiple mitoses very rapidly (cell cycle duration, asymptotically equal to 10 min). It is well suited for imaging mitosis, because during cycles 10-13, nuclei divide rapidly and synchronously without intervening cytokinesis at the surface of the embryo in a single monolayer just underneath the cortex. These rapidly dividing nuclei probably use the same mitotic machinery as other cells, but they are optimized for speed; the checkpoint is generally believed to not be stringent, allowing the study of mitotic proteins whose absence would cause cell cycle arrest in cells with a strong checkpoint. Embryos expressing GFP labeled proteins or microinjected with fluorescently labeled proteins can be easily imaged to follow live dynamics (Fig. 1). In addition, embryos can be microinjected with function-blocking antibodies or inhibitors of specific proteins to study the effect of the loss or perturbation of their function. These reagents can diffuse throughout the embryo, reaching many spindles to produce a gradient of concentration of inhibitor, which in turn results in a gradient of defects comparable to an allelic series of mutants. Ideally, if the target protein is fluorescently labeled, the gradient of inhibition can be directly visualized. It is assumed that the strongest phenotype is comparable to the null phenotype, although it is hard to formally exclude the possibility that the antibodies may have dominant effects in rare instances, so rigorous controls and cautious interpretation must be applied. Further away from the injection site, protein function is only partially lost allowing other functions of the target protein to become evident.",2009,"Ingrid Brust-Mascher, Jonathan M Scholey, Ingrid Brust-Mascher, Jonathan M Scholey"
Social learning about egg-laying substrates in fruitflies,19759037,10.1098/rspb.2009.1294,"Social learning, defined as learning from other individuals, has had dramatic effects on some species, including humans, in whom it has generated a rich culture. As a first step in examining the evolution of and mechanisms underlying social learning in insects, we tested for social learning in fruitflies (Drosophila melanogaster). Focal females (observers) that experienced novel food together with mated females (models), who had laid eggs on that food, subsequently exhibited a stronger preference for laying eggs on that food over another novel food compared with focal females that experienced the food alone. We observed no social learning, however, when observers experienced food with potentially more ambiguous social information provided by the presence of either virgin models or aggregation pheromone.

A better understanding of the evolutionary forces that shape regulatory variation and divergence can be developed by comparing expression differences among species and interspecific hybrids. Once expression differences are identified, the underlying genetics of regulatory variation or divergence can be explored. With the goal of associating cis and/or trans components of regulatory divergence with differences in gene expression, overall and allele-specific expression levels were assayed genomewide in female adult heads of Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, and their F1 hybrids. A greater proportion of cis differences than trans differences were identified for genes expressed in heads and, in accordance with previous studies, cis differences also explained a larger number of species differences in overall expression level. Regulatory divergence was found to be prevalent among genes associated with defense, olfaction, and among genes downstream of the Drosophila sex determination hierarchy. In addition, two genes, with critical roles in sex determination and micro RNA processing, Sxl and loqs, were identified as misexpressed in hybrid female heads, potentially contributing to hybrid incompatibility.",2009,"Rita M Graze, Lauren M McIntyre, Bradley J Main, Marta L Wayne, Sergey V Nuzhdin, Rita M Graze, Lauren M McIntyre, Bradley J Main, Marta L Wayne, Sergey V Nuzhdin"

High-throughput behavioral screening in this genetically tractable model organism is a potentially powerful approach, but it is currently very laborious. Our system monitors interacting pairs of flies and computes their location, orientation and wing posture. These features are used for detecting behaviors exhibited during aggression and courtship. Among these, wing threat, lunging and tussling are specific to aggression; circling, wing extension (courtship 'song') and copulation are specific to courtship; locomotion and chasing are common to both. Ethograms may be constructed automatically from these measurements, saving considerable time and effort. This technology should enable large-scale screens for genes and neural circuits controlling courtship and aggression.",2009,"Heiko Dankert, Liming Wang, Eric D Hoopfer, David J Anderson, Pietro Perona, Heiko Dankert, Liming Wang, Eric D Hoopfer, David J Anderson, Pietro Perona"

This peculiar finding was later expanded to other invertebrate species including Caenorhabditis elegans, which were also shown to bear anti-HRP epitopes. Initial experiments indicated that the epitopes recognised by anti-HRP in invertebrates are of carbohydrate nature. Indeed, more recent experiments have characterised relevant core alpha1-3-fucosylated N-glycan structures that act as epitopes in various model and parasitic organisms. Moreover, a number of enzymes required for the synthesis of such structures have been identified. Over the years, medically-relevant roles of these structures have become apparent as regards allergenicity and immunoregulation.

Experimental evidence indicates that sexually antagonistic fitness variation is abundant in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Theory predicts that the X chromosome will be enriched with this type of variation. To test this prediction in D. melanogaster, we sampled, and cytogenetically cloned, 20 X chromosomes and compared their fitness variation to genome-wide levels. At the juvenile stage, in which gender roles are most similar, the X chromosome made no detectable contribution to genome-wide fitness variation. At the adult stage, in which gender roles diverge, the X chromosome was estimated to harbour 45% of the genome-wide fitness variation and 97% of the genome-wide sexually antagonistic variation. This genomic structure has important implications for the process of sexual selection because X-linked sexually antagonistic variation contributes to negative intersexual heritability for fitness, i.e. high-fitness males (females) produce, on average, low-fitness daughters (sons).",2002,"Jonathan R Gibson, Adam K Chippindale, William R Rice, Jonathan R Gibson, Adam K Chippindale, William R Rice"

We targeted three Drosophila genes: lush, white, and dGq(alpha). In each case, target gene expression is dramatically reduced, and the white RNAi phenotype is indistinguishable from a deletion mutant.

S-element insertions are associated with the evolution of the Hsp70 genes in Drosophila melanogaster,12361573,10.1016/s0960-9822(02)01181-8,"The ""selfish DNA"" theory postulates that transposable elements (TEs) are intragenomic parasites, and that natural selection against deleterious effects associated with their presence is the main force preventing their genomic spread in natural populations. In agreement with this model, TEs in Drosophila melanogaster populations are usually found at low frequencies in most genomic locations. Only a few cases of fixation of TE insertions have been reported, usually in regions of low recombination, where selection is expected to be less effective. Here, we report a population genetics study on the apparent fixation of an S-element in a highly recombining region in two natural populations of D. melanogaster. Three similar fragments of an S-element are inserted into the 5' regions of three members of a heat shock gene family, Hsp70 (Hsp70Aa and Hsp70Ab in polytene chromosome band 87A, and Hsp70Bb in 87C). A PCR-based analysis suggests that the insertions are fixed or at high frequencies in the entire species. A population survey of the levels of nucleotide sequence variation at the insertion site in 87C in two natural populations of D. melanogaster provided evidence for reduced levels of variation in the region, normal levels of recombination, and selection, reflected in a significant departure from neutrality of the variant frequency spectrum. This was particularly strong for the S-element inverted repeats (IRs) and suggests that these are of functional significance for the host.",2002,"Xulio Maside, Carolina BartolomÃ©, Brian Charlesworth, Xulio Maside, Carolina BartolomÃ©, Brian Charlesworth"

Maternal transmission of P element transposase activity in Drosophila melanogaster depends on the last P intron,12077325,10.1073/pnas.142304199,"Maternal transmission of RNAs or proteins through the egg cytoplasm plays an important role in eukaryotic development.

However, this maternal transmission is abolished when the last of three introns is removed from the P element. These facts imply that maternal transmission of transposase activity involves the RNA transcribed from the P element rather than the polypeptide it encodes, and that to be transmitted maternally, this RNA must possess the last intron. Examination of the intron's sequence reveals that it contains a motif of nine nucleotides that has been implicated in the maternal transmission of developmentally significant RNAs. This same intron limits expression of the P transposase to the germ line of Drosophila.

"Sexual signaling and speciation, a microevolutionary perspective",12555779,,"Despite the growing evidence that sexual selection can drive speciation, the evolution of sexual signals in natural populations is far from being well-understood. Sexual signals evolve in response to a variety of factors. Some of the most important selective factors are conspecifics, transmission efficiency in a particular environment, detection by predators, and phylogenetic constraints. These factors have been addressed quite successfully in studies of single types of signals in both vertebrates and invertebrates. However, it is less clear how multimodal signals evolve because the factors listed above will act on every component of the signaling system, and the relative weights of each type of signal must be taken into account. Species of Drosophila are excellent for such analyses because they are amenable to both phenotypic experimentation and genetic manipulation. This paper presents an approach that involves two analyses: studies of which signals are sexually selected within a species, and parallel studies of the signals that are involved in behavioral isolation between closely related species. If the same signal characteristics are involved in both processes, they would provide support for the hypothesis that sexual selection can drive speciation. This approach is illustrated with studies of Hawaiian Drosophila and a review of signals that could be sexually selected in Drosophila melanogaster.",2002,"Christine R B Boake, Christine R B Boake"

Using [Leu(5)]enkephalin as a substrate, a captopril sensitive dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) and an amastatin-sensitive aminopeptidase were detected as prominent activities associated with intact discs. The formation of [Leu(5)]enkephalin-derived Phe was attributed to the concerted action of the D. melanogaster angiotensin I-converting enzyme (Ance) and a dipeptidase. The disc Ance also showed endopeptidic activity towards locust tachykinin-1 (LomTK-I) by cleaving the Gly-Val peptide bond, but this enzyme was not the sole endopeptidase activity associated with discs. Complete inhibition of the endopeptidic hydrolysis of the LomTK-1 by a disc homogenate required a combination of captopril and the neprilysin inhibitor, phosphoramidon, providing biochemical evidence for a neprilysin-like peptidase, in addition to Ance, in imaginal discs of D. melanogaster. Peptidyl AMC substrates for furin, prohormone convertase and tryptase provided evidence for trypsin-like serine endopeptidases in addition to the metalloendopeptidases. We conclude that imaginal discs are endowed with a variety of peptidases from different families that together are capable of hydrolyzing a broad range of peptides and proteins. Some of these peptidases might be responsible for the metabolic activation/inactivation of signaling peptides, as well as being involved in the production of dipeptides and free amino acids required for protein synthesis and osmotic balance during adult morphogenesis.",2002,"Claire L Wilson, Alan D Shirras, R Elwyn Isaac, Claire L Wilson, Alan D Shirras, R Elwyn Isaac"
Localization of a position effect element that affects alcohol dehydrogenase transgene expression in Drosophila melanogaster,12162808,10.1089/104454902320219095,"The molecular basis for the abnormal expression of an alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) transgene, introduced into the 25 C-D region of an Adh negative strain of Drosophila melanogaster, was investigated using a transient expression assay. A 14-kb genomic clone from the transformed line, MM-50, containing the transgene was isolated. A position effect element was identified upstream of the Adh gene within a 1.7-kb EcoRI fragment. This element acts as a silencer, greatly reducing the Adh transcriptional activity. Sequence analysis reveals that the silencer element is 1.18 kb long. There are no long open reading frames present in the sequence, suggesting that it is derived from a noncoding region. A 20-bp sequence (17/20 nucleotides matching) containing a high T/C content is repeated within the silencer region. Within each of these homologous regions there is an internal repeat of the sequence CTCTC. The repeated sequences in MM-50 contain a consensus motif, CCTCTC, for silencer elements found in the rat collagen II gene and several other vertebrate genes, including the human beta-interferon (beta-IFN) gene. Comparison of the sequence of the silencer region to the D. melanogaster whole genome sequence shows that the silencer is located within a clone derived from the 25C5-25C10 region of chromosome 2L.",2002,"Patria Castronuevo, Presley F Martin, Patria Castronuevo, Presley F Martin"

Different concentrations of argemone oil were mixed with food and third-instar larvae were allowed to feed on them for different time intervals (2, 4, 24, and 48 h). Argemone oil was found to induce hsp70 even in the lowest concentration of the adulterant while maximum tissue damage was observed in the higher two treatment groups. Malpighian tubules and midgut tissue reflected maximum damage as evidenced by both high beta-galactosidase activity and trypan blue staining in these tissues. A prior temperature shock treatment to the larvae was enough to protect the larvae from argemone oil-induced tissue damage as evidenced by little or no trypan blue staining.

We have analysed the genotoxicity of three fungicides for which it was reported that the metabolic processes taking place in vivo may determine their activity. The compounds analysed are captan, maneb, zineb and ethylenethiourea (ETU) (a metabolic derivative of ethylenebisdithiocarbamates like maneb and zineb). We have also evaluated the ability of ETU to form genotoxic derivatives in vivo analysing this compound in combined treatments with sodium nitrite. Both standard and high bioactivation NORR strains have been used. Captan, usually considered a mutagen in vitro but a non-mutagen in vivo, gave negative results in the wing spot test with both crosses. Positive results were obtained for maneb in the standard cross and for ETU in both the standard and the high bioactivation cross. The genotoxicities of maneb and ETU were higher when treatments were made on media in which nitrosation is favoured. A low absorption of the fungicide and an inefficient availability of the compound in the target may explain negative results obtained with zineb in both crosses.

Sex determination signals control ovo-B transcription in Drosophila melanogaster germ cells,11861560,,"Nonautonomous inductive signals from the soma and autonomous signals due to a 2X karyotype determine the sex of Drosophila melanogaster germ cells. These two signals have partially overlapping influences on downstream sex determination genes. The upstream OVO-B transcription factor is required for the viability of 2X germ cells, regardless of sexual identity, and for female germline sexual identity. The influence of inductive and autonomous signals on ovo expression has been controversial. We show that ovo-B is strongly expressed in the 2X germ cells in either a male or a female soma. This indicates that a 2X karyotype controls ovo-B expression in the absence of inductive signals from the female soma. However, we also show that female inductive signals positively regulate ovo-B transcription in the 1X germ cells that do not require ovo-B function. Genetic analysis clearly indicates that inductive signals from the soma are not required for ovo-B function in 2X germ cells. Thus, while somatic inductive signals and chromosome karyotype have overlapping regulatory influences, a 2X karyotype is a critical germline autonomous determinant of ovo-B function in the germline.",2002,"Justen Andrews, Brian Oliver, Justen Andrews, Brian Oliver"
Microdissection and sequence analysis of pericentric heterochromatin from the Drosophila melanogastermutant Suppressor of Underreplication,12111334,10.1007/s00412-002-0190-8,"In the Suppressor of Underreplication( SuUR) mutant strain of Drosophila melanogaster, the heterochromatin of polytene chromosomes is not underreplicated and, as a consequence, a number of beta-heterochromatic regions acquire a banded structure. The chromocenter does not form in these polytene chromosomes, and heterochromatic regions, normally part of the chromocenter, become accessible to cytological analysis. We generated four genomic DNA libraries from specific heterochromatic regions by microdissection of polytene chromosomes. In situ hybridization of individual libraries onto SuUR polytene chromosomes shows that repetitive DNA sequences spread into the neighboring euchromatic regions. This observation allows the localization of eu-heterochromatin transition zones on polytene chromosomes. We find that genomic scaffolds from the eu-heterochromatin transition zones are enriched in repetitive DNA sequences homologous to those flanking the suppressor of forked gene [ su(f) repeat]. We isolated and sequenced about 300 clones from the heterochromatic DNA libraries obtained. Most of the clones contain repetitive DNA sequences; however, some of the clones have unique DNA sequences shared with parts of unmapped genomic scaffolds.

Cells were collected, washed, lysed and resultant extracts fractionated in the presence of protein phosphatase inhibitors. D. melanogaster proteins were then denatured by boiling in SDS plus DTT, followed by immunoaffinity chromatography and SDS-PAGE purification. As anticipated, we found that a CNBr fragment derived from the N-terminal part of lamin Dm0-derivatives (amino acid residues 2-158; fragment A) was phosphorylated during both interphase and mitosis.

Regulation of P-element transposase activity in Drosophila melanogaster by hobo transgenes that contain KP elements,12019235,,"Fusions between the Drosophila hsp70 promoter and three different incomplete P elements, KP, SP, and BP1, were inserted into the Drosophila genome by means of hobo transformation vectors and the resulting transgenic stocks were tested for repression of P-element transposase activity. Only the H(hsp/KP) transgenes repressed transposase activity, and the degree of repression was comparable to that of a naturally occurring KP element. The KP transgenes repressed transposase activity both with and without heat-shock treatments. Both the KP element and H(hsp/KP) transgenes repressed the transposase activity encoded by the modified P element in the P(ry(+), Delta2-3)99B transgene more effectively than that encoded by the complete P element in the H(hsp/CP)2 transgene even though the P(ry(+), Delta2-3)99B transgene was the stronger transposase source. Repression of both transposase sources appeared to be due to a zygotic effect of the KP element or transgene. There was no evidence for repression by a strictly maternal effect; nor was there any evidence for enhancement of KP repression by the joint maternal transmission of H(hsp/KP) and H(hsp/CP) transgenes. These results are consistent with the idea that KP-mediated repression of P-element activity involves a KP-repressor polypeptide that is not maternally transmitted and that KP-mediated repression is not strengthened by the 66-kD repressor produced by complete P elements through alternate splicing of their RNA.",2002,"Michael J Simmons, Kevin J Haley, Craig D Grimes, John D Raymond, Joseph C L Fong, Michael J Simmons, Kevin J Haley, Craig D Grimes, John D Raymond, Joseph C L Fong"
Aging: the fitness-stress continuum and genetic variability,12227918,10.1080/03610730290080380,"Assuming the stress theory of aging, longevity depends upon primary selection for stress resistance and metabolic efficiency. Predominantly based upon experimental studies in the insect Drosophila melanogaster, high genetic variability for fitness, especially mortality, occurs under extreme stress. Isofemale strains derived from the progeny of recently collected single inseminated Drosophila females from the wild should provide useful biological material for extrapolating to quantitative genetic studies in man. Furthermore, environments from the benign (hormetic) to the extreme can be incorporated. Survival to old age may depend upon genes for metabolic efficiency that respond to the environmental challenges of living as limits to adaptation are approached. Under this scenario the survival of longevity mutants in man to ages analogous to the extreme life spans found in some experimental organisms under benign or protected laboratory conditions is unlikely. More future emphasis is needed on genetic variation of longevity in natural populations of experimental organisms under an array of realistically stressful environments to act as an evolutionary model for longevity in our own species.",2002,"Peter A Parsons, Peter A Parsons"

How one becomes many: blastoderm cellularization in Drosophila melanogaster,12386932,10.1002/bies.10184,"Embryonic development in Drosophila melanogaster begins with a rapid series of mitotic nuclear divisions, unaccompanied by cytokinesis, to produce a multi-nucleated single cell embryo, the syncytial blastoderm.

This process of cellularization involves integrating mechanisms of cell polarity, cell-cell adhesion and a specialized form of cytokinesis. The detailed molecular mechanism, however, is highly complex and, despite extensive analysis, remains poorly understood. Nevertheless, new insights are emerging from recent studies on aspects of membrane polarization and insertion, which show that membrane components from intracellular organelles are involved. In addition, actin and actin-associated proteins have been heavily implicated while new evidence shows that microtubule cytoskeletal elements are mechanistically involved in all aspects of cellularization.

Both enzymes cleaved substrates with C-terminal Arg or Lys, but not Leu, and were inhibited by conventional metallopeptidase inhibitors and some divalent cations. Drosophila domain 1B is more active at neutral pH and greatly prefers C-terminal Arg over Lys, whereas domain 2 is more active at pH 5-6 and slightly prefers C-terminal Lys over Arg. The differences in pH optima and substrate specificity between Drosophila domains 1B and 2 are similar to the differences between duck CPD domains 1 and 2, suggesting that these properties are essential to CPD function.",2002,"Galyna Sidyelyeva, Lloyd D Fricker, Galyna Sidyelyeva, Lloyd D Fricker"
Regulation of notch signaling via O-glucosylation insights from Drosophila studies,20816218,10.1016/S0076-6879(10)80017-5,"Recent work using Drosophila melanogaster has shown that a protein O-glucosyltransferase called Rumi regulates Notch signaling. Studies on several alleles of rumi identified in a forward genetic screen indicated that Rumi is a temperature-sensitive regulator of Notch signaling in flies. Further genetic and rescue experiments demonstrated that Rumi is a general regulator of Drosophila Notch signaling. Biochemical analyses showed that Rumi adds glucose to specific EGF repeats in the extracellular domain of Notch receptor in the Drosophila S2 cell line. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated knockdown of Rumi in this cell line resulted in a severe decrease in the level of O-linked glucose on Notch. In this chapter, we discuss the genetic and biochemical methods used to determine the role of Rumi in the regulation of Notch signaling in flies.",2010,"Tom V Lee, Hideyuki Takeuchi, Hamed Jafar-Nejad, Tom V Lee, Hideyuki Takeuchi, Hamed Jafar-Nejad"
Using In Vivo Electrochemistry to Study the Physiological Effects of Cocaine and Other Stimulants on the Drosophila melanogaster Dopamine Transporter,20352129,10.1021/cn900017w,"Dopamine neurotransmission is thought to play a critical role in addiction reinforcing mechanisms of drugs of abuse. Electrochemical techniques have been employed extensively for monitoring in vivo dopamine changes in the brains of model organisms including rats, mice, and primates. Here, we investigated the effects of several stimulants on dopamine clearance using recently developed microanalytical tools for in vivo electrochemical measurements of dopamine in the central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster. A cylindrical carbon-fiber microelectrode was placed in the protocerebral anterior medial region of the Drosophila brain (an area dense with dopamine neurons) while a micropipette injector was positioned to exogenously apply dopamine. Background-subtracted fast-scan cyclic voltammetry was carried out to quantify changes in dopamine concentration in the adult fly brain. Clearance of exogenously applied dopamine was significantly decreased in the protocerebral anterior medial area of the wild-type fly following treatment with cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, or methylphenidate. In contrast, dopamine uptake remained unchanged when identical treatments were employed in fumin mutant flies that lack functional dopamine transporters. Our in vivo results support in vitro binding affinity studies that predict these four stimulants effectively block normal Drosophila dopamine transporter function. Furthermore, we found 10 muM to be a sufficient physiological cocaine concentration to significantly alter dopamine transporter uptake in the Drosophila central nervous system. Taken together, these data indicate dopamine uptake in the Drosophila brain is decreased by psychostimulants as observed in mammals. This validates the use of Drosophila as a model system for future studies into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying drug addiction in humans.",2010,"Monique A Makos, Kyung-An Han, Michael L Heien, Andrew G Ewing, Monique A Makos, Kyung-An Han, Michael L Heien, Andrew G Ewing"
"The biology of spermatogenesis: the past, present and future",20403863,10.1098/rstb.2010.0024,"The physiological function of spermatogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and mammals is to produce spermatozoa (1n, haploid) that contain only half of the genetic material of spermatogonia (2n, diploid). This half number of chromosomes from a spermatozoon will then be reconstituted to become a diploid cell upon fertilization with an egg, which is also haploid. Thus, genetic information from two parental individuals can be passed onto their offspring. Spermatogenesis takes place in the seminiferous epithelium of the seminiferous tubule, the functional unit of the mammalian testis. In mammals, particularly in rodents, the fascinating morphological changes that occur during spermatogenesis involving cellular differentiation and transformation, mitosis, meiosis, germ cell movement, spermiogenesis and spermiation have been well documented from the 1950s through the 1980s. During this time, however, the regulation of, as well as the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying these diverse cellular events occurring throughout spermatogenesis, have remained largely unexplored. In the past two decades, important advancements have been made using new biochemical, cell and molecular biology techniques to understand how different genes, proteins and signalling pathways regulate various aspects of spermatogenesis. These include studies on the differentiation of spermatogonia from gonocytes; regulation of spermatogonial stem cells; regulation of spermatogonial mitosis; regulation of meiosis, spermiogenesis and spermiation; role of hormones (e.g. oestrogens, androgens) in spermatogenesis; transcriptional regulation of spermatogenesis; regulation of apoptosis; cell-cell interactions; and the biology of junction dynamics during spermatogenesis. The impact of environmental toxicants on spermatogenesis has also become an urgent issue in the field in light of declining fertility levels in males. Many of these studies have helped investigators to understand important similarities, differences and evolutionary relationships between C. elegans, D. melanogaster and mammals relating to spermatogenesis. In this Special Issue of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, we have covered many of these areas, and in this Introduction, we highlight the topic of spermatogenesis by examining its past, present and future.",2010,"C Yan Cheng, Dolores D Mruk, C Yan Cheng, Dolores D Mruk"
[Dynamics of the spatial organization of the chromosome set in cells of Drosophila melanogaster imaginal disks normally and under the action of the tumor-inducing mutation Merlin],20297651,,"Fluorescence of H3-p histone and DAPI was studied at different stages of interphase and mitosis in cells of imaginal disks of third-instar Drosophila melanogaster larvae. Three stages differing in the spatial organization of the chromosome set in mitosis were revealed. At the first stage (prophase, prometaphase), the histone 3 phosphorylation level rises, and the volume occupied by the chromosome set in the nucleus increases. The distinctive features of the second stage (metaphase) are a gradual decrease in the histone 3 phosphorylation (the density ofphosphorylation remaining constant) and a reduction of the volume occupied by the chromosome set. At the third stage (anaphase, telophase), the intensity and density of the signal from H3-p histone decrease, and the volume occupied by the chromosome set reduces. At this stage, in Mer4 larvae, in contrast to the control strain, the cells prematurely pass from anaphase into telophase. In addition, a subpopulation of cells with an abnormally large volume of nuclear DNA during the G1 period was revealed in Mer4 larvae.

A positive correlation was observed between total mutations and the number of wings with morphologically detectable mutations. The observed mutations were classified according to size and type of mutation per wing. Phenytoin clearly increased the frequency of total spots at all concentrations above 1.25 microg/ml. Gabapentin also increased the frequency of total spots at concentrations of 40 and 80 microg/ml. This study shows that phenytoin and gabapentin have genotoxic effects according to the SMART test; however, pregabalin displays lower genotoxicity in the SMAR assay when compared with the other two antiepileptics.

However, many abiotic environmental stresses, including temperature, fluctuate within an organism's lifespan. Given that organisms may trade-off survival at the cost of future reproduction, we investigated the effects of multiple cold exposures on survival and fertility in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. We found that multiple cold exposures significantly decreased mortality compared with the same length of exposure in a single sustained bout, but significantly decreased fecundity (as measured by r, the intrinsic rate of increase) as well, owing to a shift in sex ratio. This change was reflected in a long-term decrease in glycogen stores in multiply exposed flies, while a brief effect on triglyceride stores was observed, suggesting flies are reallocating energy stores. Given that many environments are not static, this trade-off indicates that investigating the effects of repeated stress exposure is important for understanding and predicting physiological responses in the wild.",2010,"Katie E Marshall, Brent J Sinclair, Katie E Marshall, Brent J Sinclair"

In solo mutants, sister centromeres separate before prometaphase I, disrupting meiosis I centromere orientation and causing nondisjunction of both homologous and sister chromatids. Centromeric foci of the cohesin protein SMC1 are absent in solo mutants at all meiotic stages. SOLO and SMC1 colocalize to meiotic centromeres from early prophase I until anaphase II in wild-type males, but both proteins disappear prematurely at anaphase I in mutants for mei-S332, which encodes the Drosophila homologue of the cohesin protector protein shugoshin.

Sex determination in Drosophila: The view from the top,20160499,10.4161/fly.4.1.11277,"One of the most important decisions in development is whether to be male or female. In Drosophila melanogaster, most cells make this choice independent of their neighbors such that diploid cells with one X chromosome (XY) are male and those with two X chromosomes (XX) are female. X-chromosome number is relayed through regulatory proteins that act together to activate Sex-lethal (Sxl) in XX animals. The resulting SXL female specific RNA binding protein modulates the expression of a set of downstream genes, ultimately leading to sexually dimorphic structures and behaviors. Despite the apparent simplicity of this mechanism, Sxl activity is controlled by a host of transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms that tailor its function to specific developmental scenarios. This review describes recent advances in our understanding of Sxl regulation and function, highlighting work that challenges some of the textbook views about this classical (often cited, yet poorly understood) binary switch gene.",2010,"Helen K Salz, James W Erickson, Helen K Salz, James W Erickson"
Drosophila cuticular hydrocarbons revisited: mating status alters cuticular profiles,20231905,10.1371/journal.pone.0009607,"Most living organisms use pheromones for inter-individual communication. In Drosophila melanogaster flies, several pheromones perceived either by contact/at a short distance (cuticular hydrocarbons, CHs), or at a longer distance (cis-vaccenyl acetate, cVA), affect courtship and mating behaviours. However, it has not previously been possible to precisely identify all potential pheromonal compounds and simultaneously monitor their variation on a time scale. To overcome this limitation, we combined Solid Phase Micro-Extraction with gas-chromatography coupled with mass-spectrometry. This allowed us (i) to identify 59 cuticular compounds, including 17 new CHs; (ii) to precisely quantify the amount of each compound that could be detected by another fly, and (iii) to measure the variation of these substances as a function of aging and mating. Sex-specific variation appeared with age, while mating affected cuticular compounds in both sexes with three possible patterns: variation was (i) reciprocal in the two sexes, suggesting a passive mechanical transfer during mating, (ii) parallel in both sexes, such as for cVA which strikingly appeared during mating, or (iii) unilateral, presumably as a result of sexual interaction. We provide a complete reassessment of all Drosophila CHs and suggest that the chemical conversation between male and female flies is far more complex than is generally accepted.

Conservation of male-specific expression of novel phosphoprotein phosphatases in Drosophila,20632030,10.1007/s00427-010-0332-6,"In the genome of Drosophila melanogaster, there are 19 phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) catalytic subunit coding genes. Seven of the novel members of the gene family turned out to be Drosophila-specific. The expression and evolution of these genes was investigated in the present study. CG11597 is a recently evolved gene that is expressed during all stages of morphogenesis in D. melanogaster. In contrast, the transcription of PpD5, PpD6, Pp1-Y1, and Pp1-Y2 genes is restricted to the pupa and imago developmental stages and to the testis of the males, just as that of the previously characterized PpY-55A and PpN58A. With the exception of the Y-localized Pp1-Y1 and Pp1-Y2, the testis-specific phosphatase genes are expressed in X/0 males, while none of them are expressed in XX/Y females. The mRNA of PpD5, Pp1-Y1, and PpY-55A were detected in the developing cysts by in situ hybridization, in contrast with the PpD6 transcript that was found in the distal ends of elongating spermatids. The latter localization suggests post-meiotic expression. The comparison of PPP genes in five Drosophila species revealed that the sequence of the six testis-specific phosphatases changed more rapidly than that of the housekeeping phosphatases. Our results support the ""faster male"" hypothesis. On the other hand, the male-biased expression of the six genes remained conserved during evolution despite the fact that Pp1-Y1, Pp1-Y2, and PpD6 moved from autosomes to the Y chromosome.

Natural variation in odorant recognition among odorant-binding proteins in Drosophila melanogaster,20026676,10.1534/genetics.109.113340,"Chemical recognition is essential for survival and reproduction. Adaptive evolution has resulted in diverse chemoreceptor families, in which polymorphisms contribute to individual variation in chemosensation. To gain insights into the genetic determinants of individual variation in odorant recognition, we measured olfactory responses to two structurally similar odorants in a population of wild-derived inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are the first components of the insect olfactory system to encounter odorants. Previously four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Obp99 group were associated with variation in olfactory responses to benzaldehyde. Here, we identify six different SNPs that are associated with variation in responses to a structurally similar odorant, acetophenone, in the same Obp genes. Five SNPs are in coding regions of Obp99b and Obp99d and one SNP is in the 3'-untranslated region of Obp99a (A610G). We found that the 610G allele is associated with higher response scores to acetophenone than the 610A allele, but with lower expression of Obp99a, suggesting that binding of acetophenone to Opb99a might limit rather than facilitate access to odorant receptors. Our results show that overlapping sets of OBPs contribute to odorant recognition for structurally similar odorants, but that different SNPs are associated with odorant-specific individual variation. Thus, dual olfactory recognition where OBPs regulate odorant access to receptors may enhance olfactory discrimination.",2010,"Ping Wang, Richard F Lyman, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt, Ping Wang, Richard F Lyman, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt"

Hrp48 attenuates Sxl expression to allow for proper notch expression and signaling in wing development,20351283,10.1073/pnas.0910570107,"Different signaling pathways are deployed in specific developmental contexts to generate sexually dimorphic traits. Recently, Sex-lethal (Sxl), the female determinant in Drosophila melanogaster, was shown to down-regulate Notch (N) signaling to accomplish sex-specific patterning. Paradoxically, however, both Sxl and N are ubiquitously expressed in all of the female cells. This raises a key question as to how, during monomorphic female development, N signaling escapes the negative impact of Sxl. Here, we uncover a regulatory loop involving Hrp48, an abundant Drosophila hnRNP, Sxl and N. Phenotypic consequences of the partial loss of hrp48 resemble that of N but are more pronounced in females than in males. Likewise, N levels are drastically diminished only in females. Interestingly, monomorphic female tissues including wing, eye and antennal discs display considerable increase in Sxl amounts. Finally, female-specific attenuation of N signaling is rescued upon simultaneous removal of Sxl. Thus, our data demonstrate that in monomorphic contexts, Hrp48 functions as a moderator of Sxl expression to achieve adequate levels of N receptor production and signaling. We propose that it is critical to modulate the activities of the master determinant underling sexual dimorphism, to ensure that it does not function inappropriately in monomorphic tissues and disrupt their development.",2010,"Yaron Suissa, Yossi Kalifa, Tama Dinur, Patricia Graham, Girish Deshpande, Paul Schedl, Offer Gerlitz, Yaron Suissa, Yossi Kalifa, Tama Dinur, Patricia Graham, Girish Deshpande, Paul Schedl, Offer Gerlitz"
Menin links the stress response to genome stability in Drosophila melanogaster,21124979,10.1371/journal.pone.0014049,"Background:
      
    

    
      The multiple endocrine neoplasia type I gene functions as a tumor suppressor gene in humans and mouse models. In Drosophila melanogaster, mutants of the menin gene (Mnn1) are hypersensitive to mutagens or gamma irradiation and have profound defects in the response to several stresses including heat shock, hypoxia, hyperosmolarity and oxidative stress. However, it is not known if the function of menin in the stress response contributes to genome stability. The objective of this study was to examine the role of menin in the control of the stress response and genome stability.
    

    
  


        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      Using a test of loss-of-heterozygosity, we show that Drosophila strains lacking a functional Mnn1 gene or expressing a Mnn1 dsRNA display increased genome instability in response to non-lethal heat shock or hypoxia treatments. This is also true for strains lacking all Hsp70 genes, implying that a precise control of the stress response is required for genome stability. While menin is required for Hsp70 expression, the results of epistatic studies indicate that the increase in genome instability observed in Mnn1 lack-of-function mutants cannot be accounted for by mis-expression of Hsp70. Therefore, menin may promote genome stability by controlling the expression of other stress-responsive genes. In agreement with this notion, gene profiling reveals that Mnn1 is required for sustained expression of all heat shock protein genes but is dispensable for early induction of the heat shock response.
    

    
  


        Conclusions/significance:
      
    

    
      Mutants of the Mnn1 gene are hypersensitive to several stresses and display increased genome instability when subjected to conditions, such as heat shock, generally regarded as non-genotoxic.

For this purpose, the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in wings of Drosophila melanogaster was applied to evaluate the antigenotoxic activity of six different EVOOs from four Spanish varieties (Hojiblanca, Nevadillo, Casta de Cabra, Picual). A two-level approach was followed: (1) determination of the lack of genotoxicity along with the antigenotoxic activity of EVOOs, through antigenotoxicity assays, with hydrogen peroxide as an oxidative genotoxin, and (2) evaluation of the properties of three major distinctive components of EVOOs that could be responsible for their antigenotoxic activity. The EVOOs tested are shown to be non-genotoxic; they exhibited antigenotoxic activity against the effects of hydrogen peroxide. Triolein, tyrosol and squalene did not show genotoxic effects in the proliferative imaginal cells of D. melanogaster.

A role for p38 stress-activated protein kinase in regulation of cell growth via TORC1,19917724,10.1128/MCB.00688-09,"The target of rapamycin (TOR) complex 1 (TORC1) signaling pathway is a critical regulator of translation and cell growth. To identify novel components of this pathway, we performed a kinome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. RNAi targeting components of the p38 stress-activated kinase cascade prevented the cell size increase elicited by depletion of the TOR negative regulator TSC2. In mammalian and Drosophila tissue culture, as well as in Drosophila ovaries ex vivo, p38-activating stresses, such as H(2)O(2) and anisomycin, were able to activate TORC1. This stress-induced TORC1 activation could be blocked by RNAi against mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 and 6 (MKK3/6) or by the overexpression of dominant negative Rags. Interestingly, p38 was also required for the activation of TORC1 in response to amino acids and growth factors. Genetic ablation either of p38b or licorne, its upstream kinase, resulted in small flies consisting of small cells. Mutants with mutations in licorne or p38b are nutrition sensitive; low-nutrient food accentuates the small-organism phenotypes, as well as the partial lethality of the p38b null allele.

The brains of white mutant flies, which have characteristically low pigment in the eyes, have a significantly simplified separation profile in comparison to the red-eyed, wild-type, Canton S fly. Yet, the white mutant flies were found to have significantly less amounts of dopamine, l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), salsolinol, and N-acetyltyramine in their dissected brains when compared to dissected brains of Canton S flies. In addition, significant variation has been observed in the dissected brains between individual flies that might be related to changes in neurotransmitter turnover.

Heart wall velocimetry and exogenous contrast-based cardiac flow imaging in Drosophila melanogaster using Doppler optical coherence tomography,21054114,10.1117/1.3503418,"Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) is a central organism in biology and is becoming increasingly important in the cardiovascular sciences. Prior work in optical imaging of the D. melanogaster heart has focused on static and dynamic structural anatomy. In the study, it is demonstrated that Doppler optical coherence tomography can quantify dynamic heart wall velocity and hemolymph flow in adult D. melanogaster. Since hemolymph is optically transparent, a novel exogenous contrast technique is demonstrated to increase the backscatter-based intracardiac Doppler flow signal.

Regulatory divergence in Drosophila revealed by mRNA-seq,20354124,10.1101/gr.102491.109,"The regulation of gene expression is critical for organismal function and is an important source of phenotypic diversity between species. Understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for regulatory divergence is therefore expected to provide insight into evolutionary change. Using deep sequencing, we quantified total and allele-specific mRNA expression levels genome-wide in two closely related Drosophila species (D. melanogaster and D. sechellia) and their F(1) hybrids. We show that 78% of expressed genes have divergent expression between species, and that cis- and trans-regulatory divergence affects 51% and 66% of expressed genes, respectively, with 35% of genes showing evidence of both. This is a relatively larger contribution of trans-regulatory divergence than was expected based on prior studies, and may result from the unique demographic history of D. sechellia. Genes with antagonistic cis- and trans-regulatory changes were more likely to be misexpressed in hybrids, consistent with the idea that such regulatory changes contribute to hybrid incompatibilities. In addition, cis-regulatory differences contributed more to divergent expression of genes that showed additive rather than nonadditive inheritance. A correlation between sequence similarity and the conservation of cis-regulatory activity was also observed that appears to be a general feature of regulatory evolution. Finally, we examined regulatory divergence that may have contributed to the evolution of a specific trait--divergent feeding behavior in D. sechellia. Overall, this study illustrates the power of mRNA sequencing for investigating regulatory evolution, provides novel insight into the evolution of gene expression in Drosophila, and reveals general trends that are likely to extend to other species.",2010,"C Joel McManus, Joseph D Coolon, Michael O Duff, Jodi Eipper-Mains, Brenton R Graveley, Patricia J Wittkopp, C Joel McManus, Joseph D Coolon, Michael O Duff, Jodi Eipper-Mains, Brenton R Graveley, Patricia J Wittkopp"
Autophagic degradation of dBruce controls DNA fragmentation in nurse cells during late Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis,20713604,10.1083/jcb.201002035,"Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved pathway responsible for degradation of cytoplasmic material via the lysosome. Although autophagy has been reported to contribute to cell death, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that autophagy controls DNA fragmentation during late oogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Inhibition of autophagy by genetically removing the function of the autophagy genes atg1, atg13, and vps34 resulted in late stage egg chambers that contained persisting nurse cell nuclei without fragmented DNA and attenuation of caspase-3 cleavage. The Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) dBruce was found to colocalize with the autophagic marker GFP-Atg8a and accumulated in autophagy mutants. Nurse cells lacking Atg1 or Vps34 in addition to dBruce contained persisting nurse cell nuclei with fragmented DNA. This indicates that autophagic degradation of dBruce controls DNA fragmentation in nurse cells.

Evolutionary mirages: selection on binding site composition creates the illusion of conserved grammars in Drosophila enhancers,20107516,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000829,"The clustering of transcription factor binding sites in developmental enhancers and the apparent preferential conservation of clustered sites have been widely interpreted as proof that spatially constrained physical interactions between transcription factors are required for regulatory function. However, we show here that selection on the composition of enhancers alone, and not their internal structure, leads to the accumulation of clustered sites with evolutionary dynamics that suggest they are preferentially conserved. We simulated the evolution of idealized enhancers from Drosophila melanogaster constrained to contain only a minimum number of binding sites for one or more factors. Under this constraint, mutations that destroy an existing binding site are tolerated only if a compensating site has emerged elsewhere in the enhancer. Overlapping sites, such as those frequently observed for the activator Bicoid and repressor KrÃ¼ppel, had significantly longer evolutionary half-lives than isolated sites for the same factors. This leads to a substantially higher density of overlapping sites than expected by chance and the appearance that such sites are preferentially conserved. Because D. melanogaster (like many other species) has a bias for deletions over insertions, sites tended to become closer together over time, leading to an overall clustering of sites in the absence of any selection for clustered sites. Since this effect is strongest for the oldest sites, clustered sites also incorrectly appear to be preferentially conserved. Following speciation, sites tend to be closer together in all descendent species than in their common ancestors, violating the common assumption that shared features of species' genomes reflect their ancestral state. Finally, we show that selection on binding site composition alone recapitulates the observed number of overlapping and closely neighboring sites in real D. melanogaster enhancers. Thus, this study calls into question the common practice of inferring ""cis-regulatory grammars"" from the organization and evolutionary dynamics of developmental enhancers.",2010,"Richard W Lusk, Michael B Eisen, Richard W Lusk, Michael B Eisen"

Introgression of Drosophila simulans nuclear pore protein 160 in Drosophila melanogaster alone does not cause inviability but does cause female sterility,20647504,10.1534/genetics.110.119867,"We have been analyzing genes for reproductive isolation by replacing Drosophila melanogaster genes with homologs from Drosophila simulans by interspecific backcrossing. Among the introgressions established, we found that a segment of the left arm of chromosome 2, Int(2L)S, carried recessive genes for hybrid sterility and inviability. That nuclear pore protein 160 (Nup160) in the introgression region is involved in hybrid inviability, as suggested by others, was confirmed by the present analysis. Male hybrids carrying an X chromosome of D. melanogaster were not rescued by the Lethal hybrid rescue (Lhr) mutation when the D. simulans Nup160 allele was made homozygous or hemizygous. Furthermore, we uniquely found that Nup160 is also responsible for hybrid sterility. Females were sterile when D. simulans Nup160 was made homozygous or hemizygous in the D. melanogaster genetic background. Genetic analyses indicated that the D. simulans Nup160 introgression into D. melanogaster was sufficient to cause female sterility but that other autosomal genes of D. simulans were also necessary to cause lethality. The involvement of Nup160 in hybrid inviability and female sterility was confirmed by transgene experiment.",2010,"Kyoichi Sawamura, Kazunori Maehara, Shotaro Mashino, Tatsuo Kagesawa, Miyuki Kajiwara, Kenji Matsuno, Aya Takahashi, Toshiyuki Takano-Shimizu"
Gene density profile reveals the marking of late replicated domains in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,20602235,10.1007/s00412-010-0280-y,"Regulation of replication timing has been a focus of many studies. It has been shown that numerous chromosomal regions switch their replication timing on cell differentiation in Drosophila and mice. However, it is not clear which features of these regions are essential for such regulation. In this study, we examined the organization of late underreplicated regions (URs) of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. When compared with their flanks, these regions showed decreased gene density. A detailed view revealed that these regions originate from unusual combination of short genes and long intergenic spacers. Furthermore, gene expression study showed that this pattern is mostly contributed by short testis-specific genes abundant in the URs. Based on these observations, we developed a genome scanning algorithm and identified 110 regions possessing similar gene density and transcriptional profiles. According to the published data, replication of these regions has been significantly shifted towards late S-phase in two Drosophila cell lines and in polytene chromosomes.

"Object preference by walking fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, is mediated by vision and graviperception",20581279,10.1242/jeb.041749,"Walking fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, use visual information to orient towards salient objects in their environment, presumably as a search strategy for finding food, shelter or other resources. Less is known, however, about the role of vision or other sensory modalities such as mechanoreception in the evaluation of objects once they have been reached. To study the role of vision and mechanoreception in exploration behavior, we developed a large arena in which we could track individual fruit flies as they walked through either simple or more topologically complex landscapes. When exploring a simple, flat environment lacking three-dimensional objects, flies used visual cues from the distant background to stabilize their walking trajectories. When exploring an arena containing an array of cones, differing in geometry, flies actively oriented towards, climbed onto, and explored the objects, spending most of their time on the tallest, steepest object. A fly's behavioral response to the geometry of an object depended upon the intrinsic properties of each object and not a relative assessment to other nearby objects. Furthermore, the preference was not due to a greater attraction towards tall, steep objects, but rather a change in locomotor behavior once a fly reached and explored the surface. Specifically, flies are much more likely to stop walking for long periods when they are perched on tall, steep objects. Both the vision system and the antennal chordotonal organs (Johnston's organs) provide sufficient information about the geometry of an object to elicit the observed change in locomotor behavior. Only when both these sensory systems were impaired did flies not show the behavioral preference for the tall, steep objects.",2010,"Alice A Robie, Andrew D Straw, Michael H Dickinson, Alice A Robie, Andrew D Straw, Michael H Dickinson"
"Sex and the single embryo: early deveiopment in the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata",20102629,10.1186/1471-213X-10-12,"Background:
      
    

    
      In embryos the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MTZ) integrates post-transcriptional regulation of maternal transcripts with transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying this event are being clarified in Drosophila melanogaster, little is know about the embryogenic processes in other insect species. The recent publication of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from embryos of the global pest species Ceratitis capitata (medfly) has enabled the investigation of embryogenesis in this species and has allowed a comparison of the embryogenic processes in these two related dipteran species, C. capitata and D. melanogaster, that shared a common ancestor 80-100 mya.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Using a novel PCR-based sexing method, which takes advantage of a putative LTR retrotransposon MITE insertion on the medfly Y chromosome, the transcriptomes of individual early male and female embryos were analysed using RT-PCR. This study is focused on two crucial aspects of the onset of embryonic development: sex determination and cellular blastoderm formation. Together with the three known medfly genes (Cctransformer, Cctransformer2 and Ccdoublesex), the expression patterns of other medfly genes that are similar to the D. melanogaster sex-determination genes (sisterlessA, groucho, deadpan, Sex-lethal, female lethal d, sans fille and intersex) and four cellular blastoderm formation genes (Rho1, spaghetti squash, slow-as-molasses and serendipity-alpha) were analyzed, allowing us to sketch a preliminary outline of the embryonic process in the medfly. Furthermore, a putative homologue of the Zelda gene has been considered, which in D. melanogaster encodes a DNA-binding factor responsible for the maternal-to-zygotic transition.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our novel sexing method facilitates the study of i) when the MTZ transition occurs in males and females of C. capitata, ii) when and how the maternal information of ""female-development"" is reprogrammed in the embryos and iii) similarities and differences in the regulation of gene expression in C. capitata and D. melanogaster. We suggest a new model for the onset of the sex determination cascade in the medfly: the maternally inherited Cctra transcripts in the female embryos are insufficient to produce enough active protein to inhibit the male mode of Cctra splicing. The slow rate of development and the inefficiency of the splicing mechanism in the pre-cellular blastoderm facilitates the male-determining factor (M) activity, which probably acts by inhibiting CcTRA protein activity.",2010,"Paolo Gabrieli, Andrea Falaguerra, Paolo Siciliano, Ludvik M Gomulski, Francesca Scolari, Antigone Zacharopoulou, Gerald Franz, Anna R Malacrida, Giuliano Gasperi, Paolo Gabrieli, Andrea Falaguerra, Paolo Siciliano, Ludvik M Gomulski, Francesca Scolari, Antigone Zacharopoulou, Gerald Franz, Anna R Malacrida, Giuliano Gasperi"
The native Wolbachia endosymbionts of Drosophila melanogaster and Culex quinquefasciatus increase host resistance to West Nile virus infection,20700535,10.1371/journal.pone.0011977,"Background:
      
    

    
      The bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis has been shown to increase host resistance to viral infection in native Drosophila hosts and in the normally Wolbachia-free heterologous host Aedes aegypti when infected by Wolbachia from Drosophila melanogaster or Aedes albopictus. Wolbachia infection has not yet been demonstrated to increase viral resistance in a native Wolbachia-mosquito host system.
    

    
  


        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      In this study, we investigated Wolbachia-induced resistance to West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae) by measuring infection susceptibility in Wolbachia-infected and Wolbachia-free D. melanogaster and Culex quinquefasciatus, a natural mosquito vector of WNV. Wolbachia infection of D. melanogaster induces strong resistance to WNV infection. Wolbachia-infected flies had a 500-fold higher ID50 for WNV and produced 100,000-fold lower virus titers compared to flies lacking Wolbachia. The resistance phenotype was transmitted as a maternal, cytoplasmic factor and was fully reverted in flies cured of Wolbachia. Wolbachia infection had much less effect on the susceptibility of D. melanogaster to Chikungunya (Togaviridae) and La Crosse (Bunyaviridae) viruses. Wolbachia also induces resistance to WNV infection in Cx. quinquefasciatus. While Wolbachia had no effect on the overall rate of peroral infection by WNV, Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes produced lower virus titers and had 2 to 3-fold lower rates of virus transmission compared to mosquitoes lacking Wolbachia.
    

    
  


        Conclusions/significance:
      
    

    
      This is the first demonstration that Wolbachia can increase resistance to arbovirus infection resulting in decreased virus transmission in a native Wolbachia-mosquito system. The results suggest that Wolbachia reduces vector competence in Cx. quinquefasciatus, and potentially in other Wolbachia-infected mosquito vectors.",2010,"Robert L Glaser, Mark A Meola"
The amnesiac gene is involved in the regulation of thermal nociception in Drosophila melanogaster,19995327,10.3109/01677060903419751,"Nociception is a mechanism fundamental to the ability of animals to avoid noxious stimuli capable of causing serious tissue damage. It has been established that in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel encoded by the painless gene (pain) is required for detecting thermal and mechanical noxious stimuli. Little is known, however, about other genetic components that control nociceptive behaviors in Drosophila. The amnesiac gene (amn), which encodes a putative neuropeptide precursor, is important for stabilizing olfactory memory, and is involved in various aspects of other associative and nonassociative learning. Previous studies have indicated that amn also regulates ethanol sensitivity and sleep. Here the authors show that amn plays an additional critical role in nociception. Their data show that amn mutant larvae and adults are significantly less responsive to noxious heat stimuli (greater than approximately 40 degrees C) than their wild-type counterparts. The phenotype of amn mutants in thermal nociception, which closely resembles that of pain mutants, was phenocopied in flies expressing amn RNAi, and this phenotype was rescued by the expression of a wild-type amn transgene. These results provide compelling evidence that amn is a novel genetic component of the mechanism that regulates thermal nociception in Drosophila.",2010,"Benjamin T Aldrich, Junko Kasuya, Matthew Faron, Hiroshi Ishimoto, Toshihiro Kitamoto, Benjamin T Aldrich, Junko Kasuya, Matthew Faron, Hiroshi Ishimoto, Toshihiro Kitamoto"

Super-sized deletions: improved transposon excision screens using a mus309 mutant background,20081362,10.4161/fly.4.2.10918,"Over the past two decades, a large collection of transposable elements inserted at various locations in the Drosophila melanogaster genome has been assembled. These transposons are frequently utilized in imprecise excision screens to generate deletions in genes of interest. In general, these screens involve genetic manipulations to combine a non-autonomous transposon and the appropriate transposase in individual male or female flies. DNA double-strand breaks are created via transposase action in both somatic and germline cells of these individuals and inaccurate repair events are recovered in the progeny. Because deletion-prone repair of transposon-induced double-strand breaks is rare, these screens generally require a significant investment of time and resources. We recently reported that conducting imprecise excision screens in mus309 mutant flies, which lack the Drosophila ortholog of the Bloom Syndrome helicase, results in an increase in both the number and size of deletions recovered. Here, we provide additional information for Drosophila researchers wishing to utilize this technique. In addition, we discuss how the general principle behind this technique can be applied in other contexts where double-strand breaks are being generated for the purpose of genome modification.",2010,"Alice Witsell, Daniel P Kane, Mitch McVey, Alice Witsell, Daniel P Kane, Mitch McVey"
Sexual conflict in wing size and shape in Drosophila melanogaster,20695965,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02064.x,"Intralocus sexual conflict occurs when opposing selection pressures operate on loci expressed in both sexes, constraining the evolution of sexual dimorphism and displacing one or both sexes from their optimum. We eliminated intralocus conflict in Drosophila melanogaster by limiting transmission of all major chromosomes to males, thereby allowing them to win the intersexual tug-of-war. Here, we show that this male-limited (ML) evolution treatment led to the evolution (in both sexes) of masculinized wing morphology, body size, growth rate, wing loading, and allometry. In addition to more male-like size and shape, ML evolution resulted in an increase in developmental stability for males. However, females expressing ML chromosomes were less developmentally stable, suggesting that being ontogenetically more male-like was disruptive to development. We suggest that sexual selection over size and shape of the imago may therefore explain the persistence of substantial genetic variation in these characters and the ontogenetic processes underlying them.",2010,"J K Abbott, S Bedhomme, A K Chippindale, J K Abbott, S Bedhomme, A K Chippindale"
Spermatogenic cyst and organ culture in Drosophila pseudoobscura,20694478,10.1007/s00441-010-1019-z,"Spermatogenesis is a complex series of processes that involves (1) the maintenance of a renewable pool of diploid stem cells within a niche, (2) the mitotic expansion of a subpopulation of stem cells committed to the spermatogenic pathway, and (3) the differentiation of diploid cells into highly specialized, haploid spermatozoa through meiotic and post-meiotic cellular transformations. Drosophila melanogaster is a desirable model for studying spermatogenesis, as similarities exist between mammalian and fly spermatogenesis. Like mammals, flies maintain a spermatogenic stem cell niche; the steps involved in mammalian spermatogenesis are mimicked in flies, with the main difference being that fly sperm develop within cysts rather than an epithelial cell layer. Here, we report a reliable robust system for culturing whole testes and individual spermatogenic cysts obtained from mid- to late-pupal stages of Drosophila pseudoobscura. D. pseudoobscura testes can be easily distinguished in later pupal stages because of their intense red pigmentation and are easily handled because of their simple ellipsoidal morphology. Cultured cysts are comparable in length to cysts obtained from adult flies, and motility is consistently achieved in vitro. This system not only offers a method for dissecting the mechanisms involved in meiotic and post-meiotic cellular transformations, but also can be used for the study of signaling during spermatogenesis.",2010,"Monicah Njogu, Peta-Gay Ricketts, Angela V Klaus, Monicah Njogu, Peta-Gay Ricketts, Angela V Klaus"

Isolation and characterization of a Drosophila hydei histone DNA repeat unit,2109309,10.1093/nar/18.6.1573,"Histone genes in D. hydei are organized in tandemly repeated clusters., accomodating in total 120-140 repeat units. We cloned one of the repeat units and analysed the nucleotide sequence. The repeat unit has a size of 5.1 x 10(3) base-pairs and contains one copy of each of the genes coding for the core histones and one copy coding for the histone H1. In the promoter regions of the genes we identified the presumptive cap sites and TATA boxes. Two additional sequence elements are shared by all five Drosophila hydei histone genes in the cluster. The sequence CCCTCT/G1 is found in the region upstream of the presumptive CAP sites. The sequence element AGTGAA occurs downstream of the presumptive cap sites and is, in contrast to the promoter element, also seen in the histone genes of Drosophila melanogaster. Cell-cycle dependent regulation of transcription of the Drosophila histone genes may be different from that in other eukaryotes since sequence elements involved in the regulation of cell-cycle dependent transcription are absent. Also other regulatory elements for transcription differ from those of other genes. The highly conserved H1-specific promoter sequence AAACACA and the H2B specific promoter sequence ATTTGCAT, which are involved in the cell-cycle dependent transcription of those histone genes in eukaryotes, are missing in the Drosophila genes. However at the 3' end of the genes the palindrome and the purine-rich region, both conserved sequence elements in histone genes of eukaryotes, are present. The spacer regions show a simple sequence organization.

All three species exhibit peaks of Gld expression during every major developmental stage, although considerable variation in the precise timing of these peaks exists between species. Interspecific gene transfer experiments demonstrate that the regulation and function of the D. pseudoobscura Gld is similar enough to the homologous gene in D. melanogaster to substitute for its essential role in the eclosion process. Comparison of the putative promoter sequences has identified both shared and divergent sequence elements which are likely responsible, respectively, for the conserved and divergent patterns of expression observed. The entire coding sequences of the pseudoobscura and melanogaster Gld genes are presented and shown to encode a 612-amino-acid pre-protein.

In this study we use in vitro deletion and point mutants to identify GTG as the starting codon for protein translation. We also report the sequence of a full length Drosophila choline acetyltransferase cDNA and demonstrate that RNA produced by this clone is translated into active choline acetyltransferase but at a significantly reduced efficiency when compared to the partial cDNA clone.

During the course of one passage, cells from the established cell lines grow to confluence and then aggregate into discrete condensations joined by aligned bridges of cells. Cells in these aggregates are tightly packed, and there appears to be a loss of the epithelial polarity characteristic of the vesicle cells.

Superstructure of the Drosophila ribosomal gene family,2109326,10.1073/pnas.87.8.3156,"Determining the spatial organization of middle repetitive DNA has proven difficult for several reasons. Repeated arrays are often so large that molecular methods alone cannot resolve their organization, and the lack of phenotypic markers within arrays limits the value of classical genetic analysis. We have characterized the superstructure of one repeated gene family, the ribosomal gene family of Drosophila melanogaster, by a combination of recombinational and molecular analyses of spacer-length variants. The resulting genetic maps demonstrate that some spacer variants are widely dispersed, while others are limited in their distribution. Moreover, exchange among ribosomal DNA (DNA encoding rRNA) arrays was often unequal, leading to a prediction of little or no relationship between physical location in an array and relatedness of gene family members. Extensions of our procedure may be generally useful for mapping the superstructure of repetitive DNA.",1990,"S M Williams, L G Robbins, P D Cluster, R W Allard, C Strobeck, S M Williams, L G Robbins, P D Cluster, R W Allard, C Strobeck"
Imprinting a determined state into the chromatin of Drosophila,1982376,10.1016/0168-9525(90)90303-n,"The Polycomb gene of Drosophila melanogaster is a member of a class of genes involved in the clonal transmission of the repressed state of bomeotic regulatory genes through development.

Prompt heat-shock and heat-shifted proteins associated with the nuclear matrix-intermediate filament scaffold in Drosophila melanogaster cells,2117013,,"Elevated temperatures induced the synthesis of several new proteins in Drosophila melanogaster cells. Besides the conventional heat shock (HS) proteins, another set of temperature-induced proteins has been found. These latter resemble the prompt HS proteins of mammalian cells. The prompt HS proteins of Drosophila differ from the well-known conventional HS proteins in the following properties: (1) synthesis of the prompt HS proteins is insensitive to the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, which blocks the appearance of conventional HS proteins; (2) induction of the prompt HS proteins requires a significantly higher temperature than conventional HS proteins; (3) prompt HS proteins associate strictly with the nuclear matrix-intermediate filament complex (NM-IF), while the conventional HS proteins are found in all subcellular fractions; (4) prompt HS proteins of Drosophila are induced by high temperature alone while the conventional HS proteins are also produced by a variety of stress conditions. Resinless-section electron micrographs show an altered nuclear matrix morphology in heat-shocked cells. The nuclear matrix fibers are altered in spatial distribution and have much additional electron-dense material. This added material probably reflects the soluble proteins shifted into the nuclear matrix at high temperature. The prompt HS proteins can be distinguished clearly from heat-shifted proteins by several criteria. Also, the prompt HS proteins are distinct from the heat-insensitive viral proteins of a persistent virus (HPS-1).",1990,"D A Ornelles, S Penman, D A Ornelles, S Penman"
Immunolocalization of G protein alpha-subunits in the Drosophila CNS,2108229,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.10-03-01014.1990,"In order to uncover the role of G proteins in the integrative functioning and development of the nervous system, we have begun a multidisciplinary study of the G proteins present in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. In this report, we describe the distribution of 3 different G protein alpha-subunits in the adult Drosophila CNS as determined by immunocytochemical localization using affinity-purified antibodies generated to synthetic oligopeptide sequences unique to each alpha-subunit. Western blot analysis of membranes prepared from Drosophila heads indicates that antibodies specific for the Drosophila Go alpha and Gs alpha homologs recognize the appropriate protein species predicted by molecular cloning (Quan et al., 1989; Thambi et al., 1989). The Gi alpha homolog could not be detected in head membranes by Western blotting, consistent with the negligible levels of expression observed for Gi alpha on Northern blots of head mRNA (Provost et al., 1988). However, a Drosophila Gi alpha fusion protein could be detected by these antibodies following expression in E. coli. Immunolocalization studies revealed that the Go alpha and Gs alpha homologs are expressed at highest levels in neuropils and at intermediate levels in the cortex of all brain and thoracic ganglion areas. Only the lamina contained low levels of these alpha-subunits in the CNS. Additionally, Gs alpha appears to be associated with the cell membranes of neuronal cell bodies, while Go alpha has a more diffuse distribution, suggesting its presence in the cytoplasm as well as cell membranes. In contrast to the wide distribution of Go alpha and Gs alpha, Gi alpha has a surprisingly restricted distribution in the CNS. It is present at high levels only in photoreceptor cell terminations, glomerulae of the antennal lobes, and the ocellar retina. Little or no Gi alpha was detected in other brain regions or in the thoracic ganglion. Gi alpha, then, appears to be uniquely associated with some primary sensory afferents and their terminations, suggesting the presence of specific receptor and/or effector systems which mediate the transmission of primary sensory information in Drosophila.",1990,"W J Wolfgang, F Quan, P Goldsmith, C Unson, A Spiegel, M Forte, W J Wolfgang, F Quan, P Goldsmith, C Unson, A Spiegel, M Forte"
Kinetic characterization of dihydrofolate reductase from Drosophila melanogaster,2124130,10.1139/o90-161,"The kinetic characteristics of a purified insect dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) have been described. The Km values for the substrate dihydrofolate and the cofactor NADPH have been estimated by primary and secondary Hanes plots to be 0.3 and 5.2 microM, respectively. Drosophila melanogaster DHFR can use folate and NADH at acidic pH values, but at a much lower rate than the preferred substrate and cofactor. Folic acid is a partial competitive inhibitor of Drosophila DHFR (Ki = 0.4 microM) and trimethoprim is a complete competitive inhibitor (Ki = 5.4 microM). Methotrexate binds less tightly to the Drosophila enzyme than to many other DHFRs (Kd = 0.9 nM). Drosophila DHFR is inhibited by KCl and organic mercurials and is slightly activated by urea. These data indicate that Drosophila DHFR has some characteristics which are typical of vertebrate DHFRs and others which are typical of prokaryotic DHFRs. The study of this enzyme, therefore, should aid in the definition of the structural features that are responsible for the kinetic characteristics in different DHFRs.",1990,"S L Rancourt, V K Walker, S L Rancourt, V K Walker"

Metallothionein Mto gene of Drosophila melanogaster: structure and regulation,1976815,10.1016/S0022-2836(05)80340-7,"We report the sequence of the Mto gene, one of the two known metallothionein genes of Drosophila melanogaster, and compare its structure with that of the other metallothionein gene, Mtn. The main structural features are the presence of a small intron (61 base-pairs), the presence of four potential MREs (metal regulatory elements) and the absence of a TATA box in the promoter region. Of all metals tested, Hg2+, Cd2+ and Cu2+ are the most efficient ions for inducing an increase in Mto gene transcription. The Mto and Mtn genes are differentially regulated during normal development. Transcription of Mto is detected early in embryogenesis (0 to 3 h) and persists to the third larval instar, while Mtn expression starts later in embryogenesis (12 to 15 h) and is thereafter maintained throughout larval development and adult stages. Sequencing of the Mto protein is in good agreement with the nucleic acid data. Surprisingly, attempts to isolate and characterize the Mtn protein were unsuccessful. Several lines of evidence suggest that this metallothionein is rapidly incorporated after its synthesis into lysosomes, where it would be processed in a way that would not permit its purification. The function of the Mtn protein thus appears to be mainly related to detoxification processes. The pattern of expression of Mto suggests that this gene may be involved in the control of metal homeostasis during development.",1990,"P Silar, L ThÃ©odore, R Mokdad, N E ErraÃ¯ss, A Cadic, M Wegnez, P Silar, L ThÃ©odore, R Mokdad, N E ErraÃ¯ss, A Cadic, M Wegnez"

All these transcripts are maternally expressed. Five of them display a strict maternal expression. They are found exclusively in the female germ line (nurse cells and oocyte). These transcripts are still present in the embryo as maternal information. However, a subset of the yema genes also shows an embryonic and a post-embryonic expression. Interestingly, this expression is essentially restricted to the central nervous system (CNS) throughout the fly development, to the larval and pupal imaginal discs and to a subset of cells in the male gonad, the spermatocytes.

Neurons form only in the expressed genital and anal primordium at the onset of the white prepupal stage. Two basic types of neurons differentiate in the genital disc; exteroreceptors that innervate the external bristles and enteroreceptors that innervate the internal reproductive organs. Within the genital disc, each structure has a sex-specific time during pupation when its neurons differentiate even when neurons are derived from homologous primordia.

Characterization of components of Z-bands in the fibrillar flight muscle of Drosophila melanogaster,2509482,10.1083/jcb.109.5.2157,"Twelve monoclonal antibodies have been raised against proteins in preparations of Z-disks isolated from Drosophila melanogaster flight muscle. The monoclonal antibodies that recognized Z-band components were identified by immunofluorescence microscopy of flight muscle myofibrils. These antibodies have identified three Z-disk antigens on immunoblots of myofibrillar proteins. Monoclonal antibodies alpha:1-4 recognize a 90-100-kD protein which we identify as alpha-actinin on the basis of cross-reactivity with antibodies raised against honeybee and vertebrate alpha-actinins. Monoclonal antibodies P:1-4 bind to the high molecular mass protein, projectin, a component of connecting filaments that link the ends of thick filaments to the Z-band in insect asynchronous flight muscles. The anti-projectin antibodies also stain synchronous muscle, but, surprisingly, the epitopes here are within the A-bands, not between the A- and Z-bands, as in flight muscle. Monoclonal antibodies Z(210):1-4 recognize a 210-kD protein that has not been previously shown to be a Z-band structural component. A fourth antigen, resolved as a doublet (approximately 400/600 kD) on immunoblots of Drosophila fibrillar proteins, is detected by a cross reacting antibody, Z(400):2, raised against a protein in isolated honeybee Z-disks. On Lowicryl sections of asynchronous flight muscle, indirect immunogold staining has localized alpha-actinin and the 210-kD protein throughout the matrix of the Z-band, projectin between the Z- and A-bands, and the 400/600-kD components at the I-band/Z-band junction.

Sequence analysis of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced vermilion mutations in Drosophila melanogaster,2572507,,"The mutational specificity of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) was determined in Drosophila melanogaster using the vermilion locus as a target gene. 25 mutants (16 F1 and 9 F2 mutants) were cloned and sequenced. Only base-pair changes were observed; three of the mutants represented double base substitutions. Transition mutations were the most prominent sequence change: 61% were GC----AT and 18% AT----GC substitutions. Both sequence changes can be explained by the miscoding properties of the modified guanine and thymine bases. A strong bias of neighboring bases on the occurrence of the GC----AT transitions or a strand preference of both types of transition mutations was not observed. The spectrum of ENU mutations in D. melanogaster includes a significant fraction (21%) of transversion mutations. Our data indicate that like in other prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems also in D. melanogaster the O6-ethylguanine adduct is the most prominent premutational lesion after ENU treatment. The strong contribution of the O6-ethylguanine adduct to the mutagenicity of ENU possibly explains the absence of distinct difference between the type of mutations observed in the F1 and F2 mutants. Although the latter arise later during development, the spectrum of mosaic mutations is also dominated by GC----AT transition mutations.",1989,"A Pastink, C Vreeken, M J Nivard, L L Searles, E W Vogel, A Pastink, C Vreeken, M J Nivard, L L Searles, E W Vogel"

We have mapped the 5' end of the transcript, sequenced all the intron/exon boundaries, as well as the 3' end of the transcript. The deduced mature transcript is 4291 nucleotides long without poly(A). Sequencing of the promoter region reveals a potential TATA box and (GA)n motives. The Drosophila coding sequence is more split than its vertebrate counterparts, but the splicing sites of the two last exons are precisely conserved among Drosophila and vertebrate cholinesterases, and intriguingly also with the bovine thyroglobulin gene.

rough deal: a gene required for proper mitotic segregation in Drosophila,2512302,10.1083/jcb.109.6.2951,"We describe a genetic locus rough deal (rod) in Drosophila melanogaster, identified by mutations that interfere with the faithful transmission of chromosomes to daughter cells during mitosis.

Surviving homozygous adults are sterile, and show cuticular defects associated with cell death, i.e., roughened eyes, sparse abdominal bristles, and notched wing margins. The morphological process of spermatogenesis is largely unaffected and motile sperm are produced, but meiocyte aneuploidy is common.

Plasticity of DNA conformation around the Drosophila melanogaster alcohol dehydrogenase gene under torsional stress,2541252,10.1016/0022-2836(89)90478-6,"Genomic DNA of eukaryotes is thought to be organized into multiple topological domains whose conformation can be independently regulated by torsional stress. We have demonstrated the formation of altered DNA structures around the Drosophila melanogaster alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene by sensitivity to endonucleases and by binding single-strand binding (SSB) protein. Several altered DNA structures were detected only on torsionally stressed DNA at specific sites. Some corresponded to the two initiation cap sites and the poly(A) addition sites and others were found in the 5'-flanking regions of both the adult and larval cap sites and in the 3'-flanking region of the Adh gene. In particular, the 5'-flanking regions both exhibited a plasticity of DNA conformation according to the strength of torsional stress and the concentration of Mg2+. SSB protein bound preferentially to the non-coding regions of the Adh gene only on torsionally stressed DNA and not on relaxed or linear DNA. The observed binding preference appeared to correspond to the thermodynamic stability of the base-pairs involved. These results suggest that DNA conformation is specifically organized around the Adh gene for gene function.

Regulation of behavioral and pheromonal aspects of sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster by the Sex-lethal gene,2513254,,"We have shown that the Sex-lethal (Sxl) gene, which controls morphological aspects of sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster, also regulates sexual behavior. Chromosomal males that are hemizygous for a deletion of the entire Sxl locus perform normal courtship and synthesize the two courtship-inhibiting pheromones that normal males make. However, ectopic expression of female-specific Sex-lethal gene products drastically alters chromosomal males' ability to perform and elicit courtship and increases the probability that they will synthesize a courtship-stimulating pheromone or fail to synthesize one of the inhibitory pheromones. These observations suggest that male sexual behavior is a consequence of the Sxl gene's being functionally inactive in haplo-X flies.",1989,"L Tompkins, S P McRobert, L Tompkins, S P McRobert"
A long interspersed repetitive element--the I factor of Drosophila teissieri--is able to transpose in different Drosophila species,2554335,10.1073/pnas.86.22.8887,"Long interspersed repetitive elements (LINEs) are transposable elements present in many species. In mammals they are difficult to study because most of them are defective and their transposition frequency is low. The I factor of Drosophila melanogaster is a LINE element that is particularly interesting because its transposition occurs at high frequency during I-R hybrid dysgenesis. This phenomenon occurs when males from the class of inducer strains are crossed with females from the class of reactive strains. Inducer strains contain several complete 5.4-kilobase I factors at various sites on the chromosomal arms. Reactive strains are devoid of complete I factors. Many results indicate that active I factors have invaded the D. melanogaster genome recently. To study the evolutionary history of I elements, we have cloned and sequenced a potentially active I factor from Drosophila teissieri. It is flanked by a target-site duplication and terminates at the 3' end by tandem repeats of the sequence TAA. When introduced into the germ line of a reactive strain of D. melanogaster by P element-mediated transformation, it is able to transpose and induces hybrid dysgenesis. This strengthens the hypothesis of a recent reinvasion of the D. melanogaster genome by active I factors giving rise to the inducer strains. They could have originated by horizontal transfer from another species. Such events also could occur for other LINE elements and might explain the spread of new variants in mammalian genomes. Moreover, the results give a further insight into I factor functional organization.",1989,"P Abad, C Vaury, A PÃ©lisson, M C Chaboissier, I Busseau, A Bucheton, P Abad, C Vaury, A PÃ©lisson, M C Chaboissier, I Busseau, A Bucheton"
Patterns of amino acid incorporation in long-lived genetic strains of Drosophila melanogaster,2495976,10.1016/0531-5565(89)90036-3,"This study examined the age-dependent alterations in the in vivo incorporation of labeled amino acids into protein during the adult life spans of males and females obtained from genetically based long-lived and control strains of Drosophila melanogaster. All four groups tested showed significant decreases (ca. 50%) in the uptake of labeled amino acids as a function of age. Each of the four groups had their own characteristic temporal pattern of functional decrement. Both the long-lived and the control females have similar patterns of amino acid incorporation, but the onset of these changes is delayed by 10 to 20 days in long-lived animals. These alterations in protein synthesis appear to be related to corresponding changes in the female fecundity patterns of each strain. The male patterns differ from one another and from the female patterns, but they both show periods of high fluctuation early in life followed by a terminal period of relatively low and constant synthesis. These data are consistent with the view that the overall alterations in the longevity of these two strains are likely due to changes in the timing of particular events in the adult life cycle.",1989,"R Pretzlaff, R Arking, R Pretzlaff, R Arking"

Genetic correlations between age periods were all positive and, hence, did not support the theory postulating that genes with beneficial effects on early fitness have pleiotropic unfavourable effects on late fitness. The environmental variation as well as the additive genetic variance showed a clear increase with age. The increase of environmental variation is probably a result of the individuals' increasing difficulties in coping with environmental stress due to physiological deterioration with age. Increased additive genetic variation may be explained by more and more genes being ""turned on"" with age. Alternatively, it could be caused by accumulation of deleterious mutations with different effects and may reflect the individuals' capacity of DNA repair.",1989,"G EngstrÃ¶m, L E Liljedahl, M Rasmuson, T BjÃ¶rklund, G EngstrÃ¶m, L E Liljedahl, M Rasmuson, T BjÃ¶rklund"
Comparison of the regulation of P elements in M and M' strains of Drosophila melanogaster,2553534,10.1017/s0016672300028329,"M and M' strains of Drosophila melanogaster in the P-M system of hybrid dysgenesis were compared in two series of tests, with the following results. (1) The singed-weak hypermutability regulation test showed that M' strains had lower P excision rates than M strains, suggesting that P-elements repression must occur in M' strains although it is not detectable by gonadal dysgenesis assays. (2) The evolution of mixed P+M and mixed P+M' populations was compared, using a strong P strain. The P+M cultures invariably evolved in a few generations into strong P cultures, while the P+M' cultures evolved into P-type cultures with reduced P-factor potentials. However, after 30 generations of culture, both these types of mixed cultures had similar P copy numbers, suggesting that regulation of copy number had occurred in them.",1989,"S Ronsseray, M Lehmann, G Periquet, S Ronsseray, M Lehmann, G Periquet"
Characterization of third chromosome dominant alpha-methyl dopa resistant mutants (Tcr) and their interactions with l(2)amd alpha-methyl dopa hypersensitive alleles in Drosophila melanogaster,2515113,10.1017/s0016672300028469,"In Drosophila melanogaster two alleles at the Third chromosome resistance locus (Tcr; 3-39-6) were isolated in a screen of EMS mutagenized third chromosomes for dominant resistance to dietary alpha-methyl dopa, alpha-MD, a structural analogue of DOPA. Both alleles of Tcr are recessive lethals exhibiting partial complementation. Almost half (48.3%) of the Tcr40/Tcr45 heterozygotes die as embryos but some survive past adult eclosion. Both the embryonic lethal phenotype and the adult phenotype suggest that Tcr is involved in cuticle synthesis. Tcr mutants suppress the lethality of partially complementing alleles at the alpha-MD hypersensitive locus, l(2)amd. The viability of Tcr40/Tcr45, however, is not increased by the presence of a l(2)amd allele.

"Mutations of the Drosophila myosin heavy-chain gene: effects on transcription, myosin accumulation, and muscle function",3006049,10.1073/pnas.83.5.1393,"Mutations of the myosin heavy-chain (MHC) gene of Drosophila melanogaster were identified among a group of dominant flightless and recessive lethal mutants (map position 2-52, 36A8-B1,2). One mutation is a 0.1-kilobase deletion in the 5' region of the MHC gene and reduces MHC protein in the leg and thoracic muscles of heterozygotes to levels found in 36AC haploids. Three mutations are insertions of 8-to 10-kilobase DNA elements within the MHC gene and produce truncated MHC transcripts. Heterozygotes of these insertional mutations possess levels of MHC intermediate between those of haploids and diploids. An additional mutation has no gross alteration of the MHC gene or its RNA transcripts. Although leg and larval muscles function normally in each mutant heterozygote, indirect flight muscles are defective and possess disorganized myofibrils. Homozygous mutants die during embryonic or larval development and display abnormal muscle function prior to death. These findings provide direct genetic evidence that the MHC gene at 36B (2L) is essential for both larval and adult muscle development and function. The results are consistent with the previous molecular evidence that Drosophila, unlike other organisms, has only a single muscle MHC gene per haploid genome. Quantitative expression of both copies of the MHC gene is required for function of indirect flight muscle, whereas expression of a single MHC gene is sufficient for function of larval muscles and adult tubular muscles.",1986,"K Mogami, P T O'Donnell, S I Bernstein, T R Wright, C P Emerson Jr, K Mogami, P T O'Donnell, S I Bernstein, T R Wright, C P Emerson Jr"

Since courtship song increases a females' receptivity to copulation, the frequency of mating within a short observation period was used as a measure of the ability of mutant females to distinguish between singing males and males that were unable to sing. These results show that SSa females, although lacking aristae, could distinguish between the two types of males in that they mated more readily with males that sang. Furthermore, the homoeotic legs of SSa females are not required to be present for the detection of courtship song, since females whose homoeotic legs were removed could still distinguish between singing and non-singing males.",1991,"S P McRobert, S P McRobert"

In tissues such as fat body, gastric caeca, and adult cardiac valve, the patterns of expression for ADH protein and mRNA were identical. Other tissues such as oocytes, nurse cells, imaginal disks, and brain show levels of Adh mRNA that are lower than or equivalent to those observed in the previously mentioned tissues, but they exhibit little or no ADH protein. The lack of concordance between Adh mRNA and ADH protein expression in oocytes and nurse cells may reflect the packaging of maternal mRNAs (but not ADH protein) for use in early development.

Tester strains containing a quadruplication of the white-ivory gene on the X-chromosome(s) were used. In a strain with males carrying 4 copies of the gene and females carrying 8 copies of the gene, spontaneous reversions occurred proportional to the gene copy number. In contrast to this, chemically induced reversions occurred only 1.36 times more frequently in females (carrying 8 copies of the gene) than in males (carrying 4 copies). Since chemicals inducing different lesions in DNA (bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, daunomycin, diethyl sulfate and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene) did induce statistically significant frequencies of reversions the test appears to be capable of detecting a wide variety of genotoxic chemicals with different modes of action.

Dynamic changes in the distribution of cytoplasmic myosin during Drosophila embryogenesis,1901784,,"Dramatic changes in the localization of conventional non-muscle myosin characterize early embryogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. During cellularization, myosin is concentrated around the furrow canals that form the leading margin of the plasma membrane as it plunges inward to package each somatic nucleus into a columnar epithelial cell. During gastrulation, there is specific anti-myosin staining at the apical ends of those cells that change shape in regions of invagination. Both of these localizations appear to result from a redistribution of a cortical store of maternal myosin. In the preblastoderm embryo, myosin is localized to the egg cortex, sub-cortical arrays of inclusions, and, diffusely, the yolk-free periplasm. At the syncytial blastoderm stage, myosin is found within cytoskeletal caps associated with the somatic nuclei at the embryonic surface. Following the final syncytial division, these myosin caps give rise to the myosin rings observed during cellularization. These distributions are observed with both whole immune serum and affinity-purified antibodies directed against Drosophila non-muscle myosin heavy chain. They are not detected in embryos stained with anti-Drosophila muscle myosin antiserum or with preimmune serum. Although immunolocalization can only suggest possible function, these myosin localizations and the coincident changes in cell morphology are consistent with a key role for non-muscle myosin in powering cellularization and gastrulation during embryogenesis.",1991,"P E Young, T C Pesacreta, D P Kiehart, P E Young, T C Pesacreta, D P Kiehart"

A strain of Drosophila melanogaster carrying a mutation in the apterous gene (ap4) was known to exhibit arrested vitellogenesis (rescuable by applying exogenous juvenile hormone), sterility of both sexes, and a deficiency of juvenile hormone. In this study, we examined the effects of mutations of ap on female receptivity and its relationship to juvenile hormone. We observed abnormally low female receptivity in homozygous ap strains, and heteroallelic combinations of ap mutations exhibited low receptivity. For female receptivity, ap showed no dominance (i.e., ap/ap+ was intermediate between ap/ap and ap+/ap+). Low receptivity mapped genetically to the ap locus. The reduction in female receptivity in these mutants is positively correlated with levels of juvenile hormone synthesized by their corpora allata.",1991,"J Ringo, R Werczberger, M Altaratz, D Segal, J Ringo, R Werczberger, M Altaratz, D Segal"

A relationship between emerging time and adult life span was clearly evident: early emergers were often long-lived. This relation is considered to have a genetic basis because all the larvae in a group were bred in the same culture bottle. Thus, the longevity genes involved also appear to have control over the rate of development. No significant relation was observed between hatching time and adult life span or between hatching time and emerging time. These results suggest that the function of the longevity genes begins at the larval or pupal stage before emergence, and that adult life spans differentiate at this time.",1991,"I Yonemura, T Motoyama, H Hasekura, B Boettcher, I Yonemura, T Motoyama, H Hasekura, B Boettcher"
Biochemical and physiological studies of soluble esterases from Drosophila melanogaster,1747098,10.1007/BF00554144,"Twenty-two soluble esterases have been identified in D. melanogaster by combining the techniques of native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing.

Three isozymes could not be classified and no arylesterases were identified. The carboxyl- and cholinesterases could each be further divided into two subclasses on the basis of inhibition by organophosphates and sulfhydryl reagents, respectively. Choline- and acetylesterases have characteristic substrate preferences but both subclasses of carboxylesterases are heterogeneous in substrate utilization. Subclass 2 carboxylesterases exhibit diverse temporal expression patterns, with subclass 1 carboxylesterases generally found in larvae and subclass 1 cholinesterases and acetylesterases more characteristic of pupae and adults. Tissues showing the greatest number of isozymes are larval body wall (eight) and digestive tract (six in larvae, six in adults).

Evolution of the transposable element mariner in Drosophila species,1649069,,"The distribution of the transposable element mariner was examined in the genus Drosophila. Among the eight species comprising the melanogaster species subgroup, the element is present in D. mauritiana, D. simulans, D. sechellia, D. yakuba and D. teissieri, but it is absent in D. melanogaster, D. erecta and D. orena. Multiple copies of mariner were sequenced from each species in which the element occurs. The inferred phylogeny of the elements and the pattern of divergence were examined in order to evaluate whether horizontal transfer among species or stochastic loss could better account for the discontinuous distribution of the element among the species. The data suggest that the element was present in the ancestral species before the melanogaster subgroup diverged and was lost in the lineage leading to D. melanogaster and the lineage leading to D. erecta and D. orena. This inference is consistent with the finding that mariner also occurs in members of several other species subgroups within the overall melanogaster species group. Within the melanogaster species subgroup, the average divergence of mariner copies between species was lower than the coding region of the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene. However, the divergence of mariner elements within species was as great as that observed for Adh. We conclude that the relative sequence homogeneity of mariner elements within species is more likely a result of rapid amplification of a few ancestral elements than of concerted evolution. The mariner element may also have had unequal mutation rates in different lineages.",1991,"K Maruyama, D L Hartl, K Maruyama, D L Hartl"

Southern blot hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, and DNA sequencing showed that samples of P. regalis associated with a P strain of D. melanogaster carried P element sequences. Similarly, Drosophila ribosomal DNA sequences were identified in P. regalis samples that had been associated with Drosophila cultures.

Additional data in support of the quadruplicated white-ivory reversion system to test for somatic genotoxicity in Drosophila melanogaster,1646957,10.1016/0165-1161(91)90010-6,"Cyclophosphamide, ethyl methanesulfonate, propyleneimine and tritiated water were tested in a new short-term somatic mutation bioassay, previously described by Green and coworkers (1986), to evaluate the suitability of the quadruplicated white-ivory system of Drosophila melanogaster for genotoxicity testing of chemicals. A 2.9-kb tandemly duplicated sequence of w+ within a w+ gene is responsible for the white-ivory phenotype. Reversion of wi to w+ is, in general, associated with the loss of the appended 2.9 kb or other alterations affecting this duplicated region. The appearance of light (white or nearly white) phenotypes could be due to the loss of some wi copies. Thus, in the eyes of adult males resulting from treated larvae, we can detect 2 types of sectors (red and light) on the orange-yellow background. Our results indicate that the genetic system used in this somatic assay is sensitive to the genotoxic effects of the 4 compounds tested. All 4 compounds tested were positive. Tritiated water had weak effects, cyclophosphamide was characterized by small revertant clones and ethyl methanesulfonate and propyleneimine by large clone size.

Identification of an unusual structure in the Drosophila melanogaster transposable element copia: evidence for copia transposition through an RNA intermediate,1716242,10.1016/0378-1119(91)90271-c,"The Drosophila melanogaster transposable element copia is usually 5 kb long with long terminal repeats (LTRs), and its major transcripts are a full-length 5-kb RNA and a 2-kb RNA. We have previously shown that the 2-kb RNA is generated through splicing. Here, we have cloned a genomic intronless copia using an oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe which is specific for the junction of the two exons. The unusual copia is bounded by two LTRs and lacks precisely the intron of the 2-kb copia RNA. Identification of genomic intronless copia strongly suggests that copia transposes through an RNA intermediate. Moreover, we have found that copia virus-like particles (VLPs), in which reverse transcription of copia RNA seems likely to occur, packages the spliced copia RNA much less efficiently than the full-length copia RNA. This result leads to the suggestion that much lower copy number of genomic intronless copia, as compared with that of 'normal' copia, may be responsible for the inefficient packaging of the spliced copia RNA into the VLP.",1991,"K Yoshioka, H Kanda, H Akiba, M Enoki, T Shiba, K Yoshioka, H Kanda, H Akiba, M Enoki, T Shiba"

Heat shock proteins affect RNA processing during the heat shock response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,1899282,10.1128/mcb.11.2.1062,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the splicing of mRNA precursors is disrupted by a severe heat shock. Mild heat treatments prior to severe heat shock protect splicing from disruption, as was previously reported for Drosophila melanogaster. In contrast to D. melanogaster, protein synthesis during the pretreatment is not required to protect splicing in yeast cells. However, protein synthesis is required for the rapid recovery of splicing once it has been disrupted by a sudden severe heat shock. Mutations in two classes of yeast hsp genes affect the pattern of RNA splicing during the heat shock response. First, certain hsp70 mutants, which overproduce other heat shock proteins at normal temperatures, show constitutive protection of splicing at high temperatures and do not require pretreatment. Second, in hsp104 mutants, the recovery of RNA splicing after a severe heat shock is delayed compared with wild-type cells. These results indicate a greater degree of specialization in the protective functions of hsps than has previously been suspected. Some of the proteins (e.g., members of the hsp70 and hsp82 gene families) help to maintain normal cellular processes at higher temperatures. The particular function of hsp104, at least in splicing, is to facilitate recovery of the process once it has been disrupted.",1991,"H J Yost, S Lindquist, H J Yost, S Lindquist"

Comparison of lethal mutations of Drosophila melanogaster with D. simulans when detected by the attached-X method,1305124,10.1007/BF00240557,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the attached-X method compared with the standard Basc method, and, using this method, to find out whether the observed differences in genetic polymorphisms are related to differences in lethal mutation rates in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. When EMS-treated Drosophila melanogaster males are mated to untreated attached-X females, a decrease in the progeny sex ratio (male/female + male) is observed due to the induced lethal mutations on the X chromosome. The decrease in the frequency of male progeny were shown as the attached-X index. The expected male number is calculated from the control sex ratio. The difference between the expected and the observed male numbers, expressed as the ratio to the expected male number, defines the attached-X index. The index values for various EMS concentrations were compared to the lethal frequencies obtained by the standard Basc method for the same EMS treatments, and gave a highly positive correlation (gamma = 0.993, p < 0.01, d.f. = 2), thus providing an alternative method for evaluation of possible mutagens. The attached-X method was applied to D. simulans, of which natural populations are known to have relatively low genetic variation, and frequencies of the EMS-induced X chromosome lethal mutations were estimated and compared with those in D. melanogaster. The results indicate that D. melanogaster is slightly more sensitive in the sperm and spermatogonial stages, but less susceptible in the spermatid stage when compared with D. simulans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1992,"Y Inoue, Y Inoue"
Effect of adenine metabolites on survival of Drosophila melanogaster of low xanthine dehydrogenase activity,1424569,10.1016/0305-0491(92)90313-g,"1. Low xanthine dehydrogenase (LXD) mutant Drosophila melanogaster were fed 0.2% adenine for 7 generations, no adenine for the next 2 generations (relaxed) and 0.2% adenine again for the next 3 generations (rechallenged) to obtain adenine-resistant lines of Drosophila (LXD-adenine). Flies grown without adenine served as LXD-controls. 2. Purines ranked as follows; adenine > adenosine > AMP > inosine > IMP in decreasing order of toxicity to LXD-adenine flies. 3. Addition of ribose to 9N position, or phosphate or carboxy to 6C position of the purine ring alleviated the toxicity. 4.

Positive and negative cis-regulatory elements in the bithoraxoid region of the Drosophila Ultrabithorax gene,1354838,10.1007/BF00283837,"The Ultrabithorax (Ubx) gene is required during embryogenesis and larval development to specify the third thoracic and first abdominal segments of Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations in the bithoraxoid (bxd) region, a 40 kb DNA stretch upstream of the Ubx promoter, affect cis-regulatory elements responsible for the ectodermal expression of the Ubx gene in the posterior compartment of the third thoracic segment and anterior compartment of the first abdominal segment. Our genetic data and the available molecular information are used to map the adult epidermal cis-regulatory elements within the bxd region. Genetic combinations involving mutations affecting the bxd region show that (1) redundant or cooperatively acting sequences are required for Ubx gene expression in the anterior compartment of the first abdominal segment, and (2) the expression of Ubx in the posterior compartment of the third thoracic segment is modulated by positive and negative cis-regulatory elements.",1992,"J E Castelli-Gair, M P Capdevila, J L Micol, A GarcÃ­a-Bellido, J E Castelli-Gair, M P Capdevila, J L Micol, A GarcÃ­a-Bellido"

CORRELATED RESPONSES IN LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS TO ARTIFICIAL SELECTION FOR BODY WEIGHT IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,28568675,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1992.tb02080.x,"Drosophila melanogaster that had been successfully selected on rich and poor larval medium for increased and decreased fresh weight at eclosion were tested on an intermediate medium for correlated responses in longevity, fertility, and hatchability. Larger flies laid more eggs early in life and lived shorter lives than smaller flies, which not only lived longer but also laid more eggs later in life. This supports the notion of a mortality cost of reproduction in Drosophila. The total number of eggs laid per lifetime did not differ between the two groups. The percentage of offspring hatched started at normal levels (about 50% of eggs laid), then declined rapidly in large flies. In small flies, hatchability started at a lower level early in life (40-65%), but declined less rapidly, and later in life was higher than the hatchability of eggs laid by larger flies.",1992,"Elke Hillesheim, Stephen C Stearns, Elke Hillesheim, Stephen C Stearns"
Cell type-specific gene expression in the Drosophila melanogaster male accessory gland,1525037,10.1016/0925-4773(92)90036-j,"The accessory gland of the male Drosophila melanogaster plays a vital role in reproduction. This secretory organ synthesizes products that are transferred to the female and are necessary to elicit the proper physiological and behavioral responses in the female. The accessory gland is composed of two morphologically distinct secretory cell types, the main cells and the secondary cells. Previous studies identified some genes expressed in main cells or in all accessory gland cells. In this paper we use P-element mediated enhancer traps to examine gene expression in the accessory gland. We show that, in addition to genes expressed in main cells only or in all accessory gland secretory cells, there are genes expressed specifically in secondary cells. Each cell type is uniform in the expression of its genes. Our results demonstrate that the two cell types are not only morphologically distinct but also biochemically distinct.

Molecular cloning of a cDNA coding for mouse liver xanthine dehydrogenase. Regulation of its transcript by interferons in vivo,1590774,10.1042/bj2830863,"The cDNA coding for xanthine dehydrogenase (XD) is isolated from mouse liver mRNA by cross-hybridization with a DNA fragment of the Drosophila melanogaster homologue. Two lambda bacteriophage overlapping clones represent the copy of a 4538-nucleotide-residue-long transcript with an open reading frame of 4005 nucleotide residues, coding for a putative polypeptide of 1335 amino acid residues. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the mouse XD with those of the Drosophila and the rat homologues shows a high conservation of this protein (55% identity between mouse and Drosophila, and 94% identity between mouse and rat). RNA blotting analysis demonstrates that interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and its inducers, i.e. poly(I).poly(C), bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tilorone (2,7-bis-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]fluoren-9-one), increase the expression of XD mRNA in liver. Poly(I).poly(C) also induces XD mRNA in several other tissues in vivo. Protein synthesis de novo is not required for the elevation of XD mRNA after IFN-alpha treatment, since cycloheximide does not block the induction.

Experimental strains were used with different combinations of Adh and alpha Gpdh alleles but with similar genetic background. The survival time of adult males, reared at different pre-adult temperatures, was measured at 35 degrees C. To investigate the relationship between survival and protein content, triglycerides content and ADH and alpha GPDH enzyme activity, the latter characters were measured before and after 12 h exposure to 35 degrees C. Three-way ANOVA of survival at 35 degrees C showed significant effects of rearing temperature and Adh genotype, interaction between Adh and alpha Gpdh, interaction between Adh and rearing temperature and interaction between Adh, alpha Gpdh and rearing temperature, alpha GPDH enzyme activity did not change significantly. Although protein content, triglycerides content and ADH enzyme activity decreased significantly at 35 degrees C, no correlation was observed between survival and these traits.

Catalytic properties of cholinesterases: importance of tyrosine 109 in Drosophila protein,1611033,10.1097/00001756-199201000-00010,"Tyrosine 109 in the acetylcholinesterase sequence of Drosophila melanogaster corresponds to an aspartate in vertebrate cholinesterases. Mutation of this amino acid to a glycine in the human butyrylcholinesterase gives rise to the 'atypic' phenotype characterized by a reduced activity for charged compounds. We investigated the importance of tyrosine 109 in the Drosophila sequence by in vitro mutagenesis and its expression in the Xenopus oocyte. We show here that tyrosine 109 contributes to the conformation of the active site and the charge of the residue at position 109 is important for catalytic properties. Sensitivity of the enzyme to organophosphorus and carbamate compounds is modified depending on residues present in position 109, therefore this amino acid is a potential site of resistance for insects to insecticides.",1992,"A Mutero, M Pralavorio, V Simeon, D Fournier, A Mutero, M Pralavorio, V Simeon, D Fournier"
"Evidence that intergenic spacer repeats of Drosophila melanogaster rRNA genes function as X-Y pairing sites in male meiosis, and a general model for achiasmatic pairing",1330825,,"In Drosophila melanogaster males, X-Y meiotic chromosome pairing is mediated by the nucleolus organizers (NOs) which are located in the X heterochromatin (Xh) and near the Y centromere. Deficiencies for Xh disrupt X-Y meiotic pairing and cause high frequencies of X-Y nondisjunction. Insertion of cloned rRNA genes on an Xh- chromosome partially restores normal X-Y pairing and disjunction. To map the sequences within an inserted, X-linked rRNA gene responsible for stimulating X-Y pairing, partial deletions were generated by P element-mediated destabilization of the insert. Complete deletions of the rRNA transcription unit did not interfere with the ability to stimulate X-Y pairing as long as most of the intergenic spacer (IGS) remained. Within groups of deletions that lacked the entire transcription unit and differed only in length of residual IGS material, pairing ability was proportional to the dose of 240-bp intergenic spacer repeats. Deletions of the complete rRNA transcription unit or the 28S sequences alone blocked nucleolus formation, as determined by binding of an antinucleolar antibody, yet did not interfere with pairing ability, suggesting that X-Y pairing may not be mechanistically related to nucleolus formation. A model for achiasmatic pairing in Drosophila males based upon the combined action of topoisomerase I and a strand transferase is proposed.",1992,"B D McKee, L Habera, J A Vrana, B D McKee, L Habera, J A Vrana"

Restriction mapping, DNA sequencing, and polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrate that base substitutions present in an injected oligonucleotide are incorporated into genomic sequences flanking a P insertion site in the white gene. This analysis suggests that progeny bearing directed mutations are recovered with a frequency of about 0.5 x 10(-3).

Role of oxidative stress in Drosophila aging,1383769,10.1016/0921-8734(92)90031-j,"We review the role that oxidative damage plays in regulating the lifespan of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Results from our laboratory show that the lifespan of Drosophila is inversely correlated to its metabolic rate. The consumption of oxygen by adult insects is related to the rate of damage induced by oxygen radicals, which are purported to be generated as by-products of respiration. Moreover, products of activated oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and lipofuscin are higher in animals kept under conditions of increased metabolic rate. In order to understand the in vivo relationship between oxidative damage and the production of the superoxide radical, we generated transgenic strains of Drosophila melanogaster that synthesize excess levels of enzymatically active superoxide dismutase. This was accomplished by P-element transformation of Drosophila melanogaster with the bovine cDNA for CuZn superoxide dismutase, an enzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of the superoxide radical to hydrogen peroxide and water. Adult flies that express the bovine SOD in addition to native Drosophila SOD are more resistant to oxidative stresses and have a slight but significant increase in their mean lifespan. Thus, resistance to oxidative stress and lifespan of Drosophila can be manipulated by molecular genetic intervention. In addition, we have examined the ability of adult flies to respond to various environmental stresses during senescence. Resistance to oxidative stress, such as that induced by heat shock, is drastically reduced in senescent flies. This loss of resistance is correlated with the increase in protein damage generated in old flies by thermal stress and by the insufficient protection from cellular defense systems which includes the heat shock proteins as well as the oxygen radical scavenging enzymes. Collectively, results from our laboratory demonstrate that oxidative damage plays a role in governing the lifespan of Drosophila during normal metabolism and under conditions of environmental stress.",1992,"J E Fleming, I Reveillaud, A Niedzwiecki, J E Fleming, I Reveillaud, A Niedzwiecki"

Ultrastructural analyses combined with three-dimensional reconstruction and cytochemistry show that NEI are bounded by a single membrane and that they may arise as invaginations of the inner nuclear membrane. NEI extend deeply into the nucleus. The lumens of NEI may collapse resulting in membranous sheets which may combine with those arising from adjacent NEI to form intranuclear structures resembling annulate lamellae. All NEI are associated with NEE. In contrast to NEI, NEE are enclosed in a double membrane morphologically identical to the nuclear envelope. While NEI and NEE share wheat germ agglutinin binding properties with the nuclear envelope, they differ in their ability to localize lanthanum. Pore annuli of NEI display complete lack of lanthanum binding, while those of NEE exhibit minor deposition of this cation. In contrast, pore annuli of the nuclear envelope are specifically and significantly decorated by lanthanum.

Effects of P element insertions on quantitative traits in Drosophila melanogaster,1311697,,"P element mutagenesis was used to construct 94 third chromosome lines of Drosophila melanogaster which contained on average 3.1 stable P element inserts, in an inbred host strain background previously free of P elements. The homozygous and heterozygous effects of the inserts on viability and abdominal and sternopleural bristle number were ascertained by comparing the chromosome lines with inserts to insert-free control lines of the inbred host strain. P elements reduced average homozygous viability by 12.2% per insert and average heterozygous viability by 5.5% per insert, and induced recessive lethal mutations at a rate of 3.8% per insert. Mutational variation for the bristle traits averaged over both sexes was 0.03Ve per homozygous P insert and 0.003Ve per heterozygous P insert, where Ve is the environmental variance. Mutational variation was greater for the sexes considered separately because inserts had large pleiotropic effects on sex dimorphism of bristle characters. The distributions of homozygous effects of inserts on the bristle traits were asymmetrical, with the largest effects in the direction of reducing bristle number; and highly leptokurtic, with most of the increase in variance contributed by a few lines with large effects.

To better understand the effects of a Destruxin, we looked at changes in gene expression following injection of Destruxin A into the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Microarray results revealed reduced expression of various antimicrobial peptides that play a major role in the humoral immune response of the fly. Flies co-injected with a non-lethal dose of Destruxin A and the normally innocuous Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, showed increased mortality and an accompanying increase in bacterial titers.

Expression of Drosophila MAGE gene encoding a necdin homologous protein in postembryonic neurogenesis,17084677,10.1016/j.modgep.2006.09.008,"The MAGE (melanoma antigen) family is characterized by a large conserved domain termed MAGE homology domain. Originally identified MAGE genes encoding tumor rejection antigens are expressed only in cancers and male germ cells. Necdin, which contains the MAGE homology domain, is highly expressed in postmitotic cells such as neurons and skeletal muscle cells. The human necdin gene NDN is transcribed only from the paternal allele through genomic imprinting, and its deficiency is implicated in the pathogenesis of the neurodevelopmental disorder Prader-Willi syndrome. Although over 30 MAGE genes have been identified in humans, fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) has only a single MAGE gene that encodes a protein similar to necdin homologous MAGE proteins. In this study, we analyzed the spatiotemporal expression patterns of MAGE mRNA and the encoded protein during fly development. Whole-mount embryo in situ hybridization analysis revealed that MAGE mRNA was highly expressed at the syncytial blastoderm stage and in the ventral and procephalic neurogenic regions of the ectoderm during gastrulation. In contrast, MAGE expression was nearly undetectable in postmitotic neurons of the central nervous system at late embryonic stages. During postembryonic neurogenesis, MAGE was highly expressed in neural stem cells (neuroblasts) and their progeny (ganglion mother cells and postmitotic neurons) at larval and pupal stages. MAGE was also expressed in postmitotic neurons including mushroom body neurons and retinal photoreceptors in adulthood.

Joint inference of the distribution of fitness effects of deleterious mutations and population demography based on nucleotide polymorphism frequencies,18073430,10.1534/genetics.107.080663,"The distribution of fitness effects of new mutations (DFE) is important for addressing several questions in genetics, including the nature of quantitative variation and the evolutionary fate of small populations. Properties of the DFE can be inferred by comparing the distributions of the frequencies of segregating nucleotide polymorphisms at selected and neutral sites in a population sample, but demographic changes alter the spectrum of allele frequencies at both neutral and selected sites, so can bias estimates of the DFE if not accounted for. We have developed a maximum-likelihood approach, based on the expected allele-frequency distribution generated by transition matrix methods, to estimate parameters of the DFE while simultaneously estimating parameters of a demographic model that allows a population size change at some time in the past. We tested the method using simulations and found that it accurately recovers simulated parameter values, even if the simulated demography differs substantially from that assumed in our analysis. We use our method to estimate parameters of the DFE for amino acid-changing mutations in humans and Drosophila melanogaster. For a model of unconditionally deleterious mutations, with effects sampled from a gamma distribution, the mean estimate for the distribution shape parameter is approximately 0.2 for human populations, which implies that the DFE is strongly leptokurtic. For Drosophila populations, we estimate that the shape parameter is approximately 0.35. Differences in the shape of the distribution and the mean selection coefficient between humans and Drosophila result in significantly more strongly deleterious mutations in Drosophila than in humans, and, conversely, nearly neutral mutations are significantly less frequent.",2007,"Peter D Keightley, Adam Eyre-Walker, Peter D Keightley, Adam Eyre-Walker"

Two of these, CG13794 and CG13795, are part of a previously unknown subfamily of putative solute carriers within the neurotransmitter transporter family. The third, CG4476, is a member of a related subfamily that includes characterized nutrient transporters expressed in the insect gut. Using imprecise excision of a nearby transposable P element, we have generated a series of deletions in the CG4476 gene. In fast phototaxis assays, CG4476 mutants show a decreased behavioral response to light, and the most severe mutant behaves as if it were blind.

Chromatin structure regulates gene conversion,17880262,10.1371/journal.pbio.0050246,"Homology-directed repair is a powerful mechanism for maintaining and altering genomic structure. We asked how chromatin structure contributes to the use of homologous sequences as donors for repair using the chicken B cell line DT40 as a model. In DT40, immunoglobulin genes undergo regulated sequence diversification by gene conversion templated by pseudogene donors. We found that the immunoglobulin Vlambda pseudogene array is characterized by histone modifications associated with active chromatin. We directly demonstrated the importance of chromatin structure for gene conversion, using a regulatable experimental system in which the heterochromatin protein HP1 (Drosophila melanogaster Su[var]205), expressed as a fusion to Escherichia coli lactose repressor, is tethered to polymerized lactose operators integrated within the pseudo-Vlambda donor array. Tethered HP1 diminished histone acetylation within the pseudo-Vlambda array, and altered the outcome of Vlambda diversification, so that nontemplated mutations rather than templated mutations predominated.

Effect of divergence time and recombination rate on molecular evolution of Drosophila INE-1 transposable elements and other candidates for neutrally evolving sites,17896069,10.1007/s00239-007-9028-6,"Interspecies divergence of orthologous transposable element remnants is often assumed to be simply due to genetic drift of neutral mutations that occurred after the divergence of the species. However, divergence may also be affected by other factors, such as variation in the mutation rate, ancestral polymorphisms, or selection. Here we attempt to determine the impact of these forces on divergence of three classes of sites that are often assumed to be selectively unconstrained (INE-1 TE remnants, sites within short introns, and fourfold degenerate sites) in two different pairwise comparisons of Drosophila (D. melanogaster vs. D. simulans and D. simulans vs. D. sechellia). We find that divergence of these three classes of sites is strongly influenced by the recombination environment in which they are located, and this is especially true for the closer D. simulans vs. D. sechellia comparison. We suggest that this is mainly a result of the contribution of ancestral polymorphisms in different recombination regions. We also find that intergenic INE-1 elements are significantly more diverged than intronic INE-1 in both pairwise comparisons, implying the presence of either negative selection or lower mutation rates in introns. Furthermore, we show that substitution rates in INE-1 elements are not associated with the length of the noncoding sequence in which they are located, suggesting that reduced divergence in long noncoding sequences is not due to reduced mutation rates in these regions. Finally, we show that GC content for each site within INE-1 sequences has evolved toward an equilibrium value (approximately 33%) since insertion.",2007,"Jun Wang, Peter D Keightley, Daniel L Halligan, Jun Wang, Peter D Keightley, Daniel L Halligan"
Genetic variation for cardiac dysfunction in Drosophila,17622346,10.1371/journal.pone.0000601,"Background:
      
    

    
      Common diseases may be attributed to combinations of variant alleles, but there are few model systems where the interactions among such variants can be studied in controlled genetic crosses. While association studies are designed to detect common polymorphisms of moderate effect, new approaches are required to characterize the impact on disease of interactions among rare alleles.
    

    
  


        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      We show that wild populations of Drosophila melanogaster harbor rare polymorphisms of major effect (RAME) that predispose flies to a specific disease phenotype, age-dependent cardiac dysfunction. A screen of fifty inbred wild-type lines revealed a continuous spectrum of pacing-induced heart failure that generally increases in frequency with age. High-speed video analysis of the inbred lines with high rates of inducible heart failure indicates specific defects in cardiac function, including arrhythmias and contractile disorders ('cardiomyopathies'). A combination of bulked segregant analysis and single feature polymorphism (SFP) detection localizes one of the cardiac susceptibility loci to the 97C interval on the fly genome.
    

    
  


        Conclusions/significance:
      
    

    
      Wild-type Drosophila, like humans, are predisposed to cardiac dysfunction. Identification of factors associated with these naturally occurring cardiac traits promises to provide important insights into the epidemiology of cardiac disease.",2007,"Karen A Ocorr, Timothy Crawley, Greg Gibson, Rolf Bodmer, Karen A Ocorr, Timothy Crawley, Greg Gibson, Rolf Bodmer"
Two independent duplications forming the Cyp307a genes in Drosophila,17785192,10.1016/j.ibmb.2007.05.017,"The conserved relationship between orthologs of many cytochrome P450 genes involved in ecdysone synthesis is not reflected in the evolution of the Drosophila Cyp307a genes. In Drosophila melanogaster Cyp307a1 (spook) and Cyp307a2 (spookier) both play essential roles in ecdysone synthesis and may possess biochemically redundant functions. Using phylogenetic analyses we show that the Drosophila Cyp307a genes were formed from two independent duplication events depicting a complicated evolutionary scenario. An initial duplication, from a Cyp307a2 ancestral gene produced the Cyp307a1 gene that has been maintained only in the Sophophoran subgenus. A second duplication in the Drosophila subgenus formed an additional paralog, Cyp307a3. Microsynteny is conserved for Cyp307a2 throughout the Drosophila species, but is not conserved between Cyp307a1 and Cyp307a3. These are located in different genomic positions in the Sophophora and Drosophila subgenera, respectively. Cyp307a3 appears to encode a functional gene product and is expressed in a different spatial and temporal manner to Cyp307a1. This suggests some level of functional divergence between the Cyp307a paralogs in different Drosophila species.",2007,"Tamar Sztal, Henry Chung, Lydia Gramzow, Phillip J Daborn, Philip Batterham, Charles Robin, Tamar Sztal, Henry Chung, Lydia Gramzow, Phillip J Daborn, Philip Batterham, Charles Robin"
Post-mating disparity between potential and realized immune response in Drosophila melanogaster,17311779,10.1098/rspb.2006.0394,"Reproductive costs are an essential component of evolutionary theory. For instance, an increase in reproduction is generally coupled with a decrease in immunocompetence shortly after mating. However, recent work in Drosophila melanogaster suggests that the potential to mount an immune response, as measured by the levels of immune gene expression, increases after mating. These data are in contrast to previous studies, which suggest that mating can reduce a fly's ability to survive an actual bacterial challenge (realized immunity). This pattern may be driven by some aspect of mating, independent of resource limitation, which reduces immune function by inhibiting the effective deployment of immune gene products. Though several studies have examined both the potential and the realized immunity after mating, none have examined these immune measures simultaneously. Here, we examined the link between the potential and the realized immunity in a sterile mutant of D. melanogaster. Shortly after mating, we found that female immune gene expression was high, but survival against infection was low. Surprisingly, this pattern was reversed within 24 h. Thus, estimates of immunity based on gene expression do not appear to reflect an actual ability to defend against pathogens in the hours following copulation. We discuss the possible mechanisms that may account for this pattern.",2007,"Kenneth M Fedorka, Jodell E Linder, Wade Winterhalter, Daniel Promislow, Kenneth M Fedorka, Jodell E Linder, Wade Winterhalter, Daniel Promislow"
Thermal disruption of mushroom body development and odor learning in Drosophila,17992254,10.1371/journal.pone.0001125,"Environmental stress (nutritive, chemical, electromagnetic and thermal) has been shown to disrupt central nervous system (CNS) development in every model system studied to date. However, empirical linkages between stress, specific targets in the brain, and consequences for behavior have rarely been established. The present study experimentally demonstrates one such linkage by examining the effects of ecologically-relevant thermal stress on development of the Drosophila melanogaster mushroom body (MB), a conserved sensory integration and associative center in the insect brain. We show that a daily hyperthermic episode throughout larval and pupal development (1) severely disrupts MB anatomy by reducing intrinsic Kenyon cell (KC) neuron numbers but has little effect on other brain structures or general anatomy, and (2) greatly impairs associative odor learning in adults, despite having little effect on memory or sensory acuity.

This correlation is similar to that between protein divergence and intron length previously reported in Drosophila. We show that the relationship can be explained by the content of conserved noncoding sequences (CNS) within introns. In addition, genes with a high regulatory complexity and many genetic interactions also exhibit larger amounts of CNS within their introns and lower values of nonsynonymous polymorphism.

The DmGEN protein has two nuclease domains (N and I domains) similar to XPG/class I nucleases; however, unlike class I nucleases, in DmGEN these two nuclease domains are positioned close to each other as in FEN-1/class II and EXO-1/class III nucleases. To confirm the properties of DmGEN, we characterized the active-site mutant protein (E143A E145A) and found that DmGEN had flap endonuclease activity. DmGEN possessed weak nick-dependent 5'-3' exonuclease activity. Unlike XPG, DmGEN could not incise the bubble structure. Interestingly, based on characterization of flap endonuclease activity, DmGEN preferred the blocked-flap structure as a substrate. This feature is distinctly different from FEN-1. Furthermore, DmGEN cleaved the lagging strand of the model replication fork. Immunostaining revealed that DmGEN was present in the nucleus of actively proliferating Drosophila embryos. Thus, our studies revealed that DmGEN belongs to a new class (class IV) of the RAD2/XPG nuclease family.

Aging perturbs 26S proteasome assembly in Drosophila melanogaster,17413001,10.1096/fj.06-6751com,"Aging is associated with loss of quality control in protein turnover. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is critical to this quality control process as it degrades mutated and damaged proteins. We identified a unique aging-dependent mechanism that contributes to proteasome dysfunction in Drosophila melanogaster. Our studies are the first to show that the major proteasome form in old (43-47 days old) female and male flies is the weakly active 20S core particle, while in younger (1-32 days old) flies highly active 26S proteasomes are preponderant. Old (43-47 days) flies of both genders also exhibit a decline (approximately 50%) in ATP levels, which is relevant to 26S proteasomes, as their assembly is ATP-dependent. The steep declines in 26S proteasome and ATP levels were observed at an age (43-47 days) when the flies exhibited a marked drop in locomotor performance, attesting that these are ""old age"" events. Remarkably, treatment with a proteasome inhibitor increases ubiquitinated protein levels and shortens the life span of old but not young flies. In conclusion, our data reveal a previously unknown mechanism that perturbs proteasome activity in ""old-age"" female and male Drosophila most likely depriving them of the ability to effectively cope with proteotoxic damages caused by environmental and/or genetic factors.",2007,"Vita A Vernace, Lisette Arnaud, Thomas Schmidt-Glenewinkel, Maria E Figueiredo-Pereira, Vita A Vernace, Lisette Arnaud, Thomas Schmidt-Glenewinkel, Maria E Figueiredo-Pereira"

Amplification of the 1731 LTR retrotransposon in Drosophila melanogaster cultured cells: origin of neocopies and impact on the genome,17382490,10.1016/j.gene.2007.02.001,"Transposable elements (TEs), represent a large fraction of the eukaryotic genome. In Drosophila melanogaster, about 20% of the genome corresponds to such middle repetitive DNA dispersed sequences. A fraction of TEs is composed of elements showing a retrovirus-like structure, the LTR-retrotransposons, the first TEs to be described in the Drosophila genome. Interestingly, in D. melanogaster embryonic immortal cell culture genomes the copy number of these LTR-retrotransposons was revealed to be higher than the copy number in the Drosophila genome, presumably as the result of transposition of some copies to new genomic locations [Potter, S.S., Brorein Jr., W.J., Dunsmuir, P., Rubin, G.M., 1979. Transposition of elements of the 412, copia and 297 dispersed repeated gene families in Drosophila. Cell 17, 415-427; Junakovic, N., Di Franco, C., Best-Belpomme, M., Echalier, G., 1988. On the transposition of copia-like nomadic elements in cultured Drosophila cells. Chromosoma 97, 212-218]. This suggests that so many transpositions modified the genome organisation and consequently the expression of targeted genes. To understand what has directed the transposition of TEs in Drosophila cell culture genomes, a search to identify the newly transposed copies was undertaken using 1731, a LTR-retrotransposon. A comparison between 1731 full-length elements found in the fly sequenced genome (y(1); cn(1)bw(1), sp(1) stock) and 1731 full-length elements amplified by PCR in the two cell line was done. The resulting data provide evidence that all 1731 neocopies were derived from a single copy slightly active in the Drosophila genome and subsequently strongly activated in cultured cells; and that this active copy is related to a newly evolved genomic variant (Kalmykova, A.I., et al., 2004. Selective expansion of the newly evolved genomic variants of retrotransposon 1731 in the Drosophila genomes. Mol. Biol. Evol. 21, 2281-2289).

Comparison of the minimal promoter to Mhc genes of 10 Drosophila species identified putative regulatory elements in the upstream region and in the first intron. The first intron is required for expression in four small cells of the tergal depressor of the trochanter (jump) muscle and in the indirect flight muscle. The 3'-end of this intron is important for Mhc transcription in embryonic body wall muscle and contains AT-rich elements that are protected from DNase I digestion by nuclear proteins of Drosophila embryos. Sequences responsible for expression in embryonic, adult body wall and adult head muscles are present both within and outside the intron. Elements important for expression in leg muscles and in the large cells of the jump muscle flank the intron. We conclude that multiple transcriptional regulatory elements are responsible for Mhc expression in specific sets of Drosophila muscles.",2007,"Norbert K Hess, Phillip A Singer, Kien Trinh, Massoud Nikkhoy, Sanford I Bernstein, Norbert K Hess, Phillip A Singer, Kien Trinh, Massoud Nikkhoy, Sanford I Bernstein"

Dietary restriction was achieved by food dilution, by sucrose restriction or by yeast restriction. Sucrose and yeast influenced survival in a complex manner that was best visualised using a phenotypic landscape metaphor. Survival contour maps integrate poorly understood behavioural adaptations, metabolic regulations and nutrient signalling pathways in a comprehensive manner. Dietary yeast produced a bell shaped survival response which was dependent on sucrose. Hypoxic flies had a reduced longevity as compared to normoxic flies and their dependence on specific nutrients was modified. Yeast which was beneficial to normoxic flies was toxic for hypoxic flies. In addition hypoxic flies were more resistant to starvation.

[Genetic control of intercellular adhesion or how cadherins shape the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster],17349290,10.1051/medsci/2007233285,"The beauty and diversity of cell shapes have always fascinated both biologists and physicists. In the early 1950, J. Holtfreter coined the term ""tissue affinities"" to describe the forces behind the spontaneous shaping of groups of cells. These tissue affinites were later on related to adhesive properties of cell membranes. In the 1960, Malcom Steinberg proposed the differential adhesion hypothesis (DAH) as a physical explanation of the liquid-like behaviour of tissues and cells during morphogenesis. However, the link between the cellular properties of adhesion molecules, such as the cadherins, and the physical rules that shape the body, has remained unclear. Recent in vitro studies have now shown that surface tensions, which drive the spontaneous liquid-like behaviour of cell rearrangements, are a direct and linear function of cadherin expression levels. Tissue surface tensions thus arise from differences in intercellular adhesiveness, which validates the DAH in vitro. The DAH was also vindicated in vivo by stunning experiments in Drosophila. The powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila allow to manipulate the levels and patterns of expression of several cadherins and to create artificially differences in intercellular adhesiveness. The results showed that simple laws of thermodynamics, as well as quantitative and qualitative differences in cadherins expression were sufficient to explain processes as complex as the establishment of the anterior-posterior axis and the formation of the compound eye in Drosophila.",2007,"Isabelle BÃ©cam, Jean-RenÃ© Huynh, Isabelle BÃ©cam, Jean-RenÃ© Huynh"
Climatic selection on genes and traits after a 100 year-old invasion: a critical look at the temperate-tropical clines in Drosophila melanogaster from eastern Australia,16955331,10.1007/s10709-006-9010-z,"Drosophila melanogaster invaded Australia around 100 years ago, most likely through a northern invasion. The wide range of climatic conditions in eastern Australia across which D. melanogaster is now found provides an opportunity for researchers to identify traits and genes that are associated with climatic adaptation. Allozyme studies indicate clinal patterns for at least four loci including a strong linear cline in Adh and a non-linear cline in alpha-Gpdh. Inversion clines were initially established from cytological studies but have now been validated with larger sample sizes using molecular markers for breakpoints. Recent collections indicate that some genetic markers (Adh and In(3R)Payne) have changed over the last 20 years reflecting continuing evolution. Heritable clines have been established for quantitative traits including wing length/area, thorax length and cold and heat resistance. A cline in egg size independent of body size and a weak cline in competitive ability have also been established. Postulated clinal patterns for resistance to desiccation and starvation have not been supported by extensive sampling. Experiments under laboratory and semi-natural conditions have suggested selective factors generating clinal patterns, particularly for reproductive patterns over winter. Attempts are being made to link clinal variation in traits to specific genes using QTL analysis and the candidate locus approach, and to identify the genetic architecture of trait variation along the cline. This is proving difficult because of inversion polymorphisms that generate disequilibrium among genes. Substantial gaps still remain in linking clines to field selection and understanding the genetic and physiological basis of the adaptive shifts. However D. melanogaster populations in eastern Australia remain an excellent resource for understanding past and future evolutionary responses to climate change.",2007,"Ary A Hoffmann, Andrew R Weeks, Ary A Hoffmann, Andrew R Weeks"

Drosophila dMRP4 regulates responsiveness to O2 deprivation and development under hypoxia,17284667,10.1152/physiolgenomics.00166.2006,"For most vertebrates, oxygen is a prerequisite for survival. Although we have previously shown that Drosophila melanogaster is hypoxia tolerant, how this species senses O(2) deprivation and how it survives oxygen-limiting conditions are as yet poorly understood. We began to address this question by testing for anoxic responsiveness in Drosophila adult flies following overexpression of existing EP lines. In this screen, we identified Drosophila CG14709 gene as a homolog of the human multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4/ABCC4) that is tightly regulated to oxygen. Ubiquitous expression of dMRP4 in adult flies resulted in increased sensitivity to anoxia as they had longer recovery time from anoxic stupor. When exposed to 4% oxygen chronically (throughout its lifespan), constitutive expression of dMRP4 in larvae caused larval lethality due to growth arrest. Mutations of dMRP4 led to a hypersensitive response to acute anoxia in adult flies but had less impact on larval survival under chronic hypoxia compared with dMRP4 overexpression. Selective expression of this gene in neurons, but not in glia or muscles, mirrored the same phenotype as the ubiquitous one. Thus, our data suggest novel roles for MRP in vivo: 1) dMRP4 regulates the sensitivity to acute or chronic O(2) deprivation, and 2) dMRP expression in neurons is sufficient to induce the sensitivity to O(2) in the whole organism.",2007,"He Huang, Gabriel G Haddad, He Huang, Gabriel G Haddad"

[The nuclear matrix protein EAST affects the transcription of Drosophila melanogaster genes irrespective of the presence of retrotransposon MDG4 sequences],18592696,,"Our recent study demonstrated that alteration of expression of the east gene affects the transcription of the yellow gene of Drosophila melanogaster. Furthermore, this influence was shown to be associated with the presence of retrotransposon MDG4 sequences in the pre-promoter gene region. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of different concentrations of EAST protein on the expression of different genes of Drosophila. In addition, it was analyzed whether this effect was associated with the presence of MDG4 in the allelic gene variant of interest. It was demonstrated that the effect of EAST protein on the expression of different genes was not always directly associated with the presence of MDG4 sequences. For instance, an increase in the EAST concentration had no effect on the expression of mutant alleles of the achaete-scute complex, some of which contained the MDG4 sequences. Moreover, enhancement of the east expression resulted in the alteration of the phenotypic manifestation of the mutant allele of the cut locus irrespective of the presence of MDG4. Finally, the alteration of the EAST concentrations had no substantial effect on transgene repression if they were inserted either in heterochromatin or in telomeric regions of chromosome 4, as well as on the repression induced by Polycomb group proteins. The data obtained suggested that EAST protein belonged to a new regulatory system, which was common to most of the genes, and repressed transcription of the genes located in the euchromatin regions of the chromosomes.",2007,"L S Mel'nikova, I V Krivega, P G Georgiev, A K Golovnin, L S Mel'nikova, I V Krivega, P G Georgiev, A K Golovnin"

Selective pressures on Drosophila chemosensory receptor genes,17541681,10.1007/s00239-006-0151-6,"The evolution and patterns of selection of genes encoding 10 Drosophila odorant receptors (Or) and the sex pheromone receptor Gr68a were investigated by comparing orthologous sequences across five to eight ecologically diverse species of Drosophila. Using maximum likelihood estimates of dN/dS ratios we show that all 11 genes sampled are under purifying selection, indicating functional constraint. Four of these genes (Or33c, Or42a, Or85e, and Gr68a) may be under positive selection, and if so, there is good evidence that 12 specific amino acid sites may be under positive selection. All of these sites are predicted to be located either in loop regions or just inside membrane spanning regions, and interestingly one of the two sites in Gr68a is in a similar position to a previously described polymorphism in Gr5a that causes a shift in sensitivity to its ligand trehalose. For three Ors, possible evidence for positive selection was detected along a lineage. These include Or22a in the lineage leading to D. mauritiana and Or22b in the lineage leading to D. simulans. This is of interest in light of previous data showing a change in ligand response profile for these species in the sensory neuron (ab3A) which expresses both Or22a and Or22b in D. melanogaster.

Similar muscle surface accumulation of Comm and innervation defects are observed when dNedd4 is knocked down by double-stranded RNA interference in the muscle, in dNedd4 heterozygote larvae, or in muscles overexpressing catalytically inactive dNedd4. Expression of the Comm mutants fused to a single ubiquitin that cannot be polyubiquitinated and mimics monoubiquitination [Comm(2PY-->AY)-monoUb or Comm(10K-->R)-monoUb] prevents the defects in both Comm endocytosis and synaptogenesis, suggesting that monoubiquitination is sufficient for Comm endocytosis in muscles. Expression of the Comm mutants later in muscle development, after synaptic innervation, has no effect. These results demonstrate that dNedd4 and ubiquitination are required for Commissureless endocytosis and proper neuromuscular synaptogenesis.",2007,"Bryant Ing, Alina Shteiman-Kotler, MaryLisa Castelli, Pauline Henry, Youngshil Pak, Bryan Stewart, Gabrielle L Boulianne, Daniela Rotin, Bryant Ing, Alina Shteiman-Kotler, MaryLisa Castelli, Pauline Henry, Youngshil Pak, Bryan Stewart, Gabrielle L Boulianne, Daniela Rotin"
Compartmentalization of neuronal and peripheral serotonin synthesis in Drosophila melanogaster,17376153,10.1111/j.1601-183X.2007.00307.x,"In Drosophila, one enzyme (Drosophila tryptophan-phenylalanine hydroxylase, DTPHu) hydroxylates both tryptophan to yield 5-hydroxytryptophan, the first step in serotonin synthesis, and phenylalanine, to generate tyrosine. Analysis of the sequenced Drosophila genome identified an additional enzyme with extensive homology to mammalian tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), which we have termed DTRHn. We have shown that DTRHn can hydroxylate tryptophan in vitro but displays differential activity relative to DTPHu when using tryptophan as a substrate. Recent studies in mice identified the presence of two TPH genes, Tph1 and Tph2, from distinct genetic loci. Tph1 represents the non-neuronal TPH gene, and Tph2 is expressed exclusively in the brain. In this article, we show that DTRHn is neuronal in expression and function and thus represents the Drosophila homologue of Tph2. Using a DTRHn-null mutation, we show that diminished neuronal serotonin affects locomotor, olfactory and feeding behaviors, as well as heart rate. We also show that DTPHu functions in vivo as a phenylalanine hydroxylase in addition to its role as the peripheral TPH in Drosophila, and is critical for non-neuronal developmental events.",2007,"W S Neckameyer, C M Coleman, S Eadie, S F Goodwin, W S Neckameyer, C M Coleman, S Eadie, S F Goodwin"
Latitudinal clines for nucleotide polymorphisms in the Esterase 6 gene of Drosophila melanogaster,16955332,10.1007/s10709-006-0006-5,"Previous studies have found non-neutral patterns of nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter and coding regions of Est6 in D. melanogaster. Coding region polymorphism peaks around two closely linked replacement differences associated with the EST6-F/EST6-S allozyme polymorphism. The promoter contains two common, highly diverged haplotype groups, P1 and P7, that differentially affect Est6 expression. Allozyme studies have also revealed latitudinal clines in EST6-F and EST6-S frequencies that recur across continents. Here we analyse nucleotide polymorphisms across the promoter and the region of peak coding sequence polymorphism in 10 Australian populations along a 25 degrees latitudinal gradient in order to examine the basis for the allozyme clines. As with the earlier studies, we find an excess of intermediate to high frequency variants in both the P1/P7 region and around the two EST6-F/EST6-S replacements in some populations. The two EST6-F/EST6-S replacement polymorphisms show latitudinal clines whereas the P1 and P7 groups of promoter haplotypes do not. However the strongest clines are for three co-segregating silent site polymorphisms in a 4 bp stretch at the 3' end of the sequenced region. Monte Carlo simulations show that the clines for those three sites can explain all others in the data but none of the others can explain those three. Thus the allozyme clines may not reflect selection on either the P1/P7 polymorphism or the two replacements previously associated with the EST6-F/EST-S difference.",2007,"Christopher W Coppin, Wendy A Odgers, John G Oakeshott, Christopher W Coppin, Wendy A Odgers, John G Oakeshott"

Alternative measures of response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in Drosophila melanogaster,17305818,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2006.01267.x,"Studies of invertebrate immune defence often measure genetic variation either for the fitness cost of infection or for the ability of the host to clear the parasite. These studies assume that variation in measures of resistance is related to variation in fitness costs of infection. To test this assumption, we infected strains of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, with a pathogenic bacterium. We then measured the correlation between host bacterial load and the ability to survive infection. Despite the presence of genotypic variation for both traits, bacterial load and survival post-infection were not correlated. Our results support previous arguments that individual measures of immune function and the host's ability to survive infection may be decoupled. In light of these results, we suggest that the difference between tolerance and resistance to infection, a distinction commonly found in the plant literature, may also be of value in studies of invertebrate immunity.",2007,"V Corby-Harris, K E Habel, F G Ali, D E L Promislow, V Corby-Harris, K E Habel, F G Ali, D E L Promislow"
Intergenomic epistasis for fitness: within-population interactions between cytoplasmic and nuclear genes in Drosophila melanogaster,17151264,10.1534/genetics.105.052050,"The symbiotic relationship between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes coordinates metabolic energy production and is fundamental to life among eukaryotes. Consequently, there is potential for strong selection to shape interactions between these two genomes. Substantial research attention has focused on the possibility that within-population sequence polymorphism in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is maintained by mitonuclear fitness interactions. Early theory predicted that selection will often eliminate mitochondrial polymorphisms. However, recent models demonstrate that intergenomic interactions can promote the maintenance of polymorphism, especially if the nuclear genes involved are linked to the X chromosome. Most empirical studies to date that have assessed cytonuclear fitness interactions have studied variation across populations and it is still unclear how general and strong such interactions are within populations. We experimentally tested for cytonuclear interactions within a laboratory population of Drosophila melanogaster using 25 randomly sampled cytoplasmic genomes, expressed in three different haploid nuclear genetic backgrounds, while eliminating confounding effects of intracellular bacteria (e.g., Wolbachia). We found sizable cytonuclear fitness interactions within this population and present limited evidence suggesting that these effects were sex specific. Moreover, the relative fitness of cytonuclear genotypes was environment specific. Sequencing of mtDNA (2752 bp) revealed polymorphism within the population, suggesting that the observed cytoplasmic genetic effects may be mitochondrial in origin.",2007,"Damian K Dowling, Urban Friberg, Frank Hailer, GÃ¶ran Arnqvist, Damian K Dowling, Urban Friberg, Frank Hailer, GÃ¶ran Arnqvist"
Role of mitochondrial remodeling in programmed cell death in Drosophila melanogaster,17488630,10.1016/j.devcel.2007.02.002,"The role of mitochondria in Drosophila programmed cell death remains unclear, although certain gene products that regulate cell death seem to be evolutionarily conserved. We find that developmental programmed cell death stimuli in vivo and multiple apoptotic stimuli ex vivo induce dramatic mitochondrial fragmentation upstream of effector caspase activation, phosphatidylserine exposure, and nuclear condensation in Drosophila cells. Unlike genotoxic stress, a lipid cell death mediator induced an increase in mitochondrial contiguity prior to fragmentation of the mitochondria. Using genetic mutants and RNAi-mediated knockdown of drp-1, we find that Drp-1 not only regulates mitochondrial fission in normal cells, but mediates mitochondrial fragmentation during programmed cell death. Mitochondria in drp-1 mutants fail to fragment, resulting in hyperplasia of tissues in vivo and protection of cells from multiple apoptotic stimuli ex vivo. Thus, mitochondrial remodeling is capable of modifying the propensity of cells to undergo death in Drosophila.",2007,"Gaurav Goyal, Brennan Fell, Apurva Sarin, Richard J Youle, V Sriram, Gaurav Goyal, Brennan Fell, Apurva Sarin, Richard J Youle, V Sriram"

The technique has been assayed on Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera) and Eucypris virens (Ostracoda) spermatozoa and based on the inclusion of freshly obtained male gametes in low melting agarose microgels at 37 degrees C to prevent cell damage. Gametes spread onto pretreated slides are dehydrated and directly observed under phase contrast microscopy or stained with specific fluorochromes for DNA or proteins. Results show that the morphology of whole sperm is highly preserved allowing identification of sperm characteristics difficult to visualize after using standard fixation procedures. In Drosophila melanogaster, SIM allows the simultaneous visualization of the complete flagellum plus a clear delineation of the DNA. It also allows observation of morphological changes in the perforatorium as sperm elongation takes place. In E. virens, SIM slides visualized under phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy show three main morphological regions on the entire spermatozoa. Spermatozoa of this species are auto-fluorescent under wavelength excitation from 387 to 562 nm. In spite of this, clear localization of the DNA molecule at the posterior 1/3 part of the whole spermatozoa can also be achieved after single DAPI staining or in combination with Mercuri-diBrom-Fluorescein, a fluorochrome for protein targeting.",2007,"C LÃ³pez-FernÃ¡ndez, A BaltanÃ¡s, J De La Torre, J GosÃ¡lvez, C LÃ³pez-FernÃ¡ndez, A BaltanÃ¡s, J De La Torre, J GosÃ¡lvez"

Also, gcm-gcm2 are required for the differentiation of specific adult neurons. We here show that gcm is expressed in precursors and postmitotic, migrating, cells of the medulla neuropile glia (mng) lineage. It is also expressed in a thoracic glial lineage and in neurons of the ventral nerve cord (VNC).

Recent studies in cultured mammalian epithelial cells have shed some light on the requirement for the polarity complexes in the regulation of epithelial cell function, including an unexpected link to the regulation of directed cell migration. However, many questions still remain regarding the molecular mechanisms of polarity regulation and whether disruption of polarity protein function is an important step in the development of human cancers. Here we will review what is currently understood about the regulation of cell polarity, migration, and invasion and the level of functional conservation between Drosophila and mammalian tissues.

Acp26Aa is processed in the mated female's genital tract. We show here that the processing involves sequential proteolytic cleavages, and we map the position of these cleavages. Although Acp26Aa is not cleaved in the male, its processing in the mated female requires activities donated by the male. Acp26Aa ectopically expressed in unmated females is not processed. Processing of Acp26Aa in wild-type females mated to males with altered seminal fluid is dependent on the presence and amount of male accessory gland secretions. The need for molecular cooperation between the sexes for processing of Acp26Aa could restrict its activity to the mated female.",1995,"M Park, M F Wolfner, M Park, M F Wolfner"

Evidence for differential processing of the FMRFamide polypeptide precursor,8562315,10.1007/BF02736754,"DPKQDFMRFamide is one of five different FMRFamide-containing peptides encoded in the Drosophila FMRFamide gene. To study the cellular expression of DPKQDFMRFamide, we have generated antisera to DPKQD, the N-terminal sequence of the peptide, to avoid crossreactivity with other -FMRFamide-containing peptides. The antisera were purified and the specificity characterized. DPKQDFMRFamide immunoreactive material is first observed in the embryonic central nervous system (CNS) in one cell of the subesophageal ganglion and one cell in each of the three thoracic ganglia. This pattern of expression is observed in larval, pupal, and adult neural tissue, albeit with increased signal intensity. In larva, pupa, and adult, additional cells in the superior protocerebrum, a thoracic ganglion, and an abdominal ganglion express DPKQDFMRFamide immunoreactive material. Immunoreactivity is observed in a cell in the lateral protocerebrum of pupa and adult and cells in the optic lobe of adult. No immunoreactive material was observed in gut tissue. DPKQDFMRFamide antisera stain a subset of cells previously identified by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to express the FMRFamide transcript and polypeptide precursor.

We also surveyed the response patterns of alpha-amylase activity to dietary carbohydrates at the larval and adult stages. The levels of alpha-amylase activity depended on both repression by dietary glucose (glucose repression) and induction by dietary starch (starch induction). In general, our data suggest that glucose repression was conserved among species at both stages while starch induction was mainly observed in larvae, although the degree of the response depended on species. In D. lebanonensis lebanonensis and D. serrata, larvae expressed electrophoretically different alpha-amylase variants (isozymes) from those of adult flies.

Treatment of third instar larvae of D. melanogaster with pyrazole, in contrast with 4-MP, produced an increase in the number of dorsocentral and scutellar macrochaetae and wing-notches in the adult fly. A large difference in the penetrance of terata in males and females was observed. Similar effects were observed in flies lacking ADH molecules. The teratogenicity of pyrazole must be due to disturbance of processes other than ADH inhibition. Synergistic effects were observed between pyrazole and methoxyacetic acid (MAA), an in vitro inhibitor of sarcosine dehydrogenase activity.

There were large line x density, line, and sex effects, but no systematic relationship between density and life span was detected. Mortality curves level off at older ages in 23 out of 24 sex-genotype combinations, irrespective of initial cohort density. Density has only second-order effects on the pattern of oldest-old mortality over the range of densities studied here.

The analysis of the distribution of nucleosome-free gaps on newly replicated DNA has revealed some structural details about the maturation of nucleosomes and provides direct evidence that parental nucleosomes have an altered structure at the replication fork.

Identification of two Drosophila TGF-beta family members in the grasshopper Schistocerca americana,7666445,10.1007/BF00170667,"Intercellular signaling molecules of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily are required for pattern formation in many multicellular organisms. The decapentaplegic (dpp) gene of Drosophila melanogaster has several developmental roles. To improve our understanding of the evolutionary diversification of this large family we identified dpp in the grasshopper Schistocerca americana. S. americana diverged from D. melanogaster approximately 350 million years ago, utilizes a distinct developmental program, and has a 60-fold-larger genome than D. melanogaster. Our analyses indicate a single dpp locus in D. melanogaster and S. americana, suggesting that dpp copy number does not correlate with increasing genome size. Another TGF-beta superfamily member, the D. melanogaster gene 60A, is also present in only one copy in each species. Comparison of homologous sequences from D. melanogaster, S. americana, and H. sapiens, representing roughly 900 million years of evolutionary distance, reveals significant constraint on sequence divergence for both dpp and 60A. In the signaling portion of the dpp protein, the amino acid identity between these species exceeds 74%.

Lineage studies have shown that glial cells display different mechanisms of differentiation depending on their position in the nervous system. In some cases, glial differentiation seems intimately associated with neurogenesis, as has already been shown in the vertebrate peripheral nervous system.

White as a reporter gene to detect transcriptional silencers specifying position-specific gene expression during Drosophila melanogaster eye development,8582614,,"The white+ gene was used as a reporter to detect transcriptional silencer activity in the Drosophila genome. Changes in the spatial expression pattern of white were scored in the adult eye as nonuniform patterns of pigmentation. Thirty-six independent P[lacW] transposant lines were collected. These represent 12 distinct pigmentation patterns and probably 21 loci. The spatial pigmentation pattern is due to cis-acting suppression of white+ expression, and the suppression probably depends on cell position rather than cell type. The mechanism of suppression differs from inactivation by heterochromatin. In addition, activation of lacZ in P[lacW] occurs also in specific patterns in imaginal discs and embryos in many of the lines. The expression patterns of white+ and lacZ may reflect the activity of regulatory elements belonging to an endogenous gene near each P[lacW] insertion site. We speculate that these putative POSE (position-specific expression) genes may have a role in pattern formation of the eye as well as other imaginal structures.

By localizing nucleic acids with high precision, it is possible to infer the native structure of chromosomes, replication factories and transcript processing complexes. To increase the value of this technique, we have established the limits of resolution of two-color in situ hybridization to chromosomal DNA in diploid chromosomes of Drosophila embryonic nuclei. Using high-resolution 3-dimensional optical microscopy and computational image analysis, we establish that we can distinguish the location of chromosomal sequences that lie 27-29 kb apart within a 40 kb transcription unit with an accuracy of about 100 nm. Contrary to observations made in mammalian tissue culture cells, we find that when the gene is expressed, it assumes an open configuration, and that the extent of decondensation is variable from chromosome to chromosome. Further experiments suggest that variation in gene structure results from asynchrony in transcriptional elongation. We suggest that the phenomenon we observe is the diploid analog to chromosomal puffing that occurs in the transcriptionally active regions of Drosophila polytene chromosomes.",1995,"S Gunawardena, E Heddle, M C Rykowski, S Gunawardena, E Heddle, M C Rykowski"

Multiple sites upstream of the larval promoter were protected from deoxyribonuclease digestion by both embryonic and larval extracts. Comparison with foot-printing results for Adh genes from other Drosophila species revealed only one nuclease-protected region that is conserved in both sequence and position. Clustered point mutations in this sequence were analyzed by footprinting analysis, transient transformation and in vitro transcription. Two separate sequences in this footprinting region exerted positive effects on transcription from the Adh proximal promoter in the larval fat body. The effects of these sequences on gene expression were synergistic. One of these sequences, TGATAA, bound in vitro to Drosophila melanogaster box A binding factor protein, as shown by gel mobility shift assays.

Protein divergence was scored by high-resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). Close to 500 protein spots from gonadal tissues (testis and ovary) and nongonadal tissues (malpighian tubules and brain) were analyzed and protein divergence was calculated based on presence vs absence. Both testis and ovary proteins showed higher divergence than nongonadal proteins, and also a highly significant positive correlation with postzygotic reproductive isolation but a weaker correlation with postzygotic reproductive isolation. Particularly, a positive and significant correlation was found between proteins expressed in the testis and postzygotic reproductive isolation among closely related species such as the within-phylad species in the D. virilis group. The high levels of male-reproductive-tract protein divergence between species might be associated with F1 hybrid male sterility among closely related species. If so, a lower level of ovary protein divergence should be expected on the basis that F1 female hybrids are fully fertile. However, this is not necessarily true if relatively few genes are responsible for the reproductive isolation observed between closely related species, as recent studies seem to suggest. We suggest that the faster rate of evolution of gonadal proteins in comparison to nongonadal proteins and the association of that rate with postzygotic reproductive isolation may be the result of episodic and/or sexual selection on male and female molecular traits.",1995,"A Civetta, R S Singh, A Civetta, R S Singh"
Purification of kinesin-related protein complexes from eggs and embryos,7787059,,"We have developed a biochemical screen for the identification of kinesin-related proteins (KRPs) in their natural host cells and the subsequent purification of these KRPs as native, functional multimeric complexes. The screen involves immunoblotting with pan-kinesin peptide antibodies that recognize several presumptive KRPs in cytosolic extracts; the antibodies have been used so far to monitor the purification of two bona fide kinesin-related motor protein complexes. These two KRPs were purified via AMPPNP-induced microtubule affinity binding, ATP-induced elution from AMPPNP microtubules, gel filtration fractionation, and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. KRP(85/95) from sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) eggs behaves as a heterotrimeric complex of 85-, 95-, and 115-kDa subunits that moves toward the plus ends of microtubule tracks at approximately 0.4 micron/s. KRP(130) from fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster) embryos behaves as a homotetrameric complex of four 130-kDa subunits that moves toward the plus ends of microtubule tracks at approximately 0.04 micron/s. To our knowledge, KRP(85/95) and KRP(130) are the only KRPs to have been purified from native tissue as functional multimeric motor complexes.",1995,"D G Cole, J M Scholey, D G Cole, J M Scholey"
The larval optic nerve is required for the development of an identified serotonergic arborization in Drosophila melanogaster,7781904,10.1006/dbio.1995.1175,"The larval visual system in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster consists of two bilateral clusters of 12 photoreceptor cells. These neurons send their axons in a fascicle, the Bolwig's nerve, toward the target area in the ventral lateral region of the brain hemispheres. We describe the development of a serotonergic arborization originating in the central brain found in the larval optic center in association with the larval optic nerve. This arborization is formed by processes from larval neurons born during embryogenesis. However, these neuronal processes do not reach their final destination, the larval optic center, until late in larval development. Using mutations that disrupt the connectivity and/or development of the larval photoreceptor cells, as well as mosaic analysis, we demonstrate that the innervation of the larval optic center by this serotonergic arborization depends upon contact with the larval optic nerve.",1995,"M Mukhopadhyay, A R Campos, M Mukhopadhyay, A R Campos"

It forages at body temperatures above 50 degrees C, and the critical thermal maxima are at 53.6 +/- 0.8 degrees C for Cataglyphis bombycina and 55.1 +/- 1.1 degrees C for Cataglyphis bicolor. The synthesis and accumulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) were analyzed in Cataglyphis and compared to Formica, an ant living in more moderate climates, and to two Drosophila species. In Cataglyphis, protein synthesis continues at temperatures up to 45 degrees C as compared to 39 degrees C for Formica and Drosophila. The two Drosophila species, Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila ambigua, differ with respect to their maximal induction of HSP synthesis and accumulation by 3-4 degrees C. In contrast, the two ant species accumulate HSPs prior to their exposure to heat, and in Cataglyphis the temperature of maximal HSP induction by de novo protein synthesis is only 2 degrees C higher than in Formica. These findings are interpreted as preadaption of the ants prior to exposure to high temperatures.",1995,"W J Gehring, R Wehner, W J Gehring, R Wehner"
DNA organization and polymorphism of a wild-type Drosophila telomere region,8565699,10.1007/BF00352254,"Telomeres at the ends of linear chromosomes of eukaryotes protect the chromosome termini from degradation and fusion. While telomeric replication/elongation mechanisms have been studied extensively, the functions of subterminal sequences are less well understood. In general, subterminal regions can be quite polymorphic, varying in size from organism to organism, and differing among chromosomes within an organism. The subterminal regions of Drosophila melanogaster are not well characterized today, and it is not known which and how many different components they contain. Here we present the molecular characterization of DNA components and their organization in the subterminal region of the left arm of chromosome 2 of the Oregon RC wild-type strain of D. melanogaster, including a minisatellite with a 457bp repeat length.

It was established that chromosomes of an inadaptive line LA have a decreased level of polyteny. The hybrids were superior to both parent lines in terms of the trait studied. Giant chromosomes of line and hybrid females had higher levels of polyteny than male chromosomes.

In the repair test, larval stock, consisting of meiotic recombination-deficient double mutant mei-9a mei-41D5 males and repair-proficient females, was exposed to the test agents, and the preferential killing of the mutant larvae was taken as evidence of the DNA-damaging effect. In this test, AFM1 was registered as a DNA-damaging agent with an activity approximately 3-fold lower than that of AFB1. In the wing spot test, where larval flies, trans-heterozygous for the somatic cell markers mwh and flr3, were treated and the wings were inspected at adulthood for spots manifesting the phenotypes of the markers, AFM1 exerted a genotoxic effect compatible to that of AFB1.

These transformants are carrying wild-type ChAT cDNA fused to different lengths of 5' flanking sequence of the ChAT gene. Appropriate genetic crosses were used to introduce the transgene into animals with a presumptive null genetic background for endogenous ChAT. Expression of ChAT protein could thus be attributed exclusively to the transgene. Using a monoclonal antibody against Drosophila ChAT, we have investigated the spatial distribution of transgenic ChAT and compared it to the normal distribution of ChAT protein in wild-type animals. The brains of 7.4 kb cDNA transformants showed a ChAT expression pattern similar to that of wild-type animals in the first- and second-order sensory neuropil but reduced expression in other highly ordered neuropil. Several lines that were transformed with 1.2 kb or 0.8 kb of 5' flanking DNA demonstrated relatively normal expression in sensory neuropil. In addition, these lines also showed ectopic expression in higher order neuropil. In the optic lobe, the expression pattern directed by 7.4 kb of 5' flanking DNA was very similar to that of wild-type ChAT expression. In contrast, 1.2 kb or 0.8 kb transformants showed reduced levels of expression and a more limited pattern of distribution in the optic lobe. Our results suggest that the 5' flanking DNA of the ChAT gene can be divided into several separable positive and negative regulatory regions, which define various subsets of cholinergic neurons in the nervous system.",1995,"K Yasuyama, T Kitamoto, P M Salvaterra, K Yasuyama, T Kitamoto, P M Salvaterra"

As have been observed with other P elements, many of the PZ-induced mutations result from insertion of the P element into the promoter or 5' untranslated regions of the affected gene. We document here a novel mechanism for mutagenesis by this element. We show that sequences present within the element direct aberrant splicing and termination events that produce a mRNA composed of 5' sequences from the mutated gene (in this case, pipsqueak) and 3' sequences from within the P[lacZ, rosy+] element.

P-element-induced variation in metabolic regulation in Drosophila,7705634,,"Movement of transposable elements have demonstrated to be a cause of genetic variation that is relevant to quantitative characters in Drosophila.

Balancer chromosome and 139 third-chromosome lines of Drosophila melanogaster bearing unique stable P-element insertions in a common genetic background. Lines that were homozygous for second-chromosome P-element insertions were significantly more heterogeneous than control lines in 10 of 16 characters, whereas third-chromosome insertion lines were heterogeneous in 11 of the 16 traits. The average mutational variance per insertion relative to environmental variance (Vm/Ve) was 5.7 x 10(-2), and estimates varied widely across characters. The distributions of mutational effects tended to be skewed, with a longer tail toward high enzyme activities. Mutational effects deviated from a normal distribution in 15 of the 16 traits and significant outlier lines were found in both a positive and negative direction in several characters. Pleiotropic effects of single P-element insertions were quantified by correlation, and, after correcting for simultaneous tests, of the 91 correlations, 37 were significant at the 5% level. The pattern of pleiotropic effects derviated both from the equilibrium genetic correlations quantified in a previous study and from the correlations of mutational effects in a mutation-accumulation experiment, suggesting that multiple forces are at play that shape extant variation.",1995,"A G Clark, L Wang, T Hulleberg, A G Clark, L Wang, T Hulleberg"

The frequency distribution of silent variation in the slow allele was compatible with the neutral model in all three samples. The number of haplotypes in East Africa was significantly higher than in the other two populations. The largest divergence, as measured by Fst, was between the East African population and a group made up from the West African, the European, and previously studied American populations. We suggest that a split first occurred within African populations at least 44000 years ago. European populations separated from West Africa more recently, between the last glacial maximum and the post-glacial optimum, 18,000 to 8,000 years ago. We suggest that this species was domesticated recently relative to human evolution, possibly with the advent of agriculture. Population differentiation with respect to the two allozymes, fast and slow, does not follow the geographical pattern of silent variation. It opposes European to both African populations, and probably results from selection for adaptation to alcohol in recent temperate populations.",1995,"V BÃ©nassi, M Veuille, V BÃ©nassi, M Veuille"

The properties of these receptors suggest that they may be involved in atherosclerosis and host defense. We have previously observed a similar receptor activity in Drosophila melanogaster embryonic macrophages and in the Drosophila macrophage-like Schneider L2 cell line. Expression cloning was used to isolate from L2 cells a cDNA that encodes a third class (class C) of scavenger receptor, Drosophila SR-CI (dSR-CI). dSR-CI expression was restricted to macrophages/hemocytes during embryonic development. When expressed in mammalian cells, dSR-CI exhibited high affinity and saturable binding of 125I-labeled acetylated low density lipoprotein and mediated its chloroquine-dependent, presumably lysosomal, degradation. Although the broad polyanionic ligand-binding specificity of dSR-CI was similar to that of SR-A, their predicted protein sequences are not similar. dSR-CI is a 609-residue type I integral membrane protein containing several well-known sequence motifs, including two complement control protein (CCP) domains and somatomedin B, MAM, and mucin-like domains. Macrophage scavenger receptors apparently mediate important, well-conserved functions and may be pattern-recognition receptors that arose early in the evolution of host-defense mechanisms.

Molecular characterization of spontaneous mutations at the scarlet locus of Drosophila melanogaster,8544833,10.1007/BF00418037,"Six spontaneous mutations of the scarlet (st) locus of Drosophila melanogaster have been studied at the molecular level. Two of the mutants (st1 and stsp) arose in laboratory populations, while the other four (stcob, stct89, stdct and stdv) were isolated from natural populations. In five of these there is a DNA insertion within the st region and in four cases the insertion has been identified as being a transposable element; these include the retrotransposons 412 and B104/roo, and also jockey a member of the LINE family. In the other case (stdct), the insertion appears to consist of partially duplicated st sequences. In two of the mutants (st1 and stdv) the same transposable element (412) has inserted in the same orientation at exactly the same site within the st gene. The transposable element insertions are found in intron and exon regions of the st gene and also in the putative upstream regulatory region; insertions located in introns or exons result in the production of truncated st transcripts.

Evolution of the larval peripheral nervous system in Drosophila species has involved a change in sensory cell lineage,15293048,10.1007/s00427-004-0422-4,"A key challenge in evolutionary biology is to identify developmental events responsible for morphological changes. To determine the cellular basis that underlies changes in the larval peripheral nervous system (PNS) of flies, we first described the PNS pattern of the abdominal segments A1-A7 in late embryos of several fly species using antibody staining. In contrast to the many variations reported previously for the adult PNS pattern, we found that the larval PNS pattern has remained very stable during evolution. Indeed, our observation that most of the analysed Drosophilinae species exhibit exactly the same pattern as Drosophila melanogaster reveals that the pattern observed in D. melanogaster embryos has remained constant for at least 40 million years. Furthermore, we observed that the PNS pattern in more distantly related flies (Calliphoridae and Phoridae) is only slightly different from the one in D. melanogaster. A single difference relative to D. melanogaster was identified in the PNS pattern of the Drosophilinae fly D. busckii, the absence of a specific external sensory organ.

In the case of the repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor (REST), a central player in blocking the neuronal phenotype in vertebrate non-neural tissue, the invertebrate homolog is absent, raising the possibility that distinct strategies are used to establish the CNS of invertebrates. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen designed specifically to identify functional analogs of REST, we show that Drosophila melanogaster uses a strategy that is functionally similar to, but appears to have evolved independently of, REST. The gene at the center of the strategy in flies encodes the repressor Tramtrack88 (Ttk88), a protein with no discernable homology to REST but that nonetheless is able to interact with the same transcriptional partners. Ttk88 uses the REST corepressor Drosophila CoREST to coordinately regulate a set of genes encoding the same neuronal hallmarks that are regulated by REST in vertebrates. Our findings indicate that repression is an important mechanism for regulating neuronal phenotype across phyla and suggest that co-option of a similar corepressor complex occurred to restrict expression of genes critical for neuronal function to a compartmentalized nervous system.",2004,"Julia E Dallman, Janet Allopenna, Andrew Bassett, Andrew Travers, Gail Mandel, Julia E Dallman, Janet Allopenna, Andrew Bassett, Andrew Travers, Gail Mandel"

Variation in the tetracycline responsive agent contributed substantially to variation in longevity and production of metabolic oxidants. Changes in diurnal cycle of activity have been investigated: such changes should be responsive to metabolism-related damage because of the role of the very active neurons, retinal cells and muscle. The metabolic oxidant model predicts that longevity and production of metabolic oxidants should be negatively correlated, and that deterioration of behavior with age and metabolic oxidant production should be positively correlated. Only the first prediction was verified: rate of change in behavior correlated with metabolic oxidants, consistent with a role of metabolic oxidants in this age-related change.

Results of intraspecific variation show a contrasting pattern between the two species. The mode of sperm length distributions is much less variable in D. simulans than in D. melanogaster. The sperm size divergence is unaffected whenever the two species are in sympatry (tested at 'Evolution Canyon', Mount Carmel, Israel) or in allopatry, but the two species react differentially to abiotic local factors.

The second step, the oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetate, has been a source of controversy, with some authors arguing that it is carried out primarily by ADH itself, rather than a separate aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) as in mammals. We review recent evidence that ALDH plays an important role in ethanol metabolism in Drosophila. In support of this view, we report that D. melanogaster populations maintained on ethanol-supplemented media evolved higher activity of ALDH, as well as of ADH. We have also tentatively identified the structural gene responsible for the majority of ALDH activity in D. melanogaster. We hypothesize that variation in ALDH activity may make an important contribution to the observed wide variation in ethanol tolerance within and among Drosophila species.",2004,"James D Fry, Carolyn M Bahnck, Maryann Mikucki, Nitin Phadnis, Wendy C Slattery"
[Search for new regulatory elements of the Bithorax complex in Drosophila melanogaster],15648143,,"The Ultrabithorax (Ubx), Abdominal-A (Abd-A), and Abdominal-B (Abd-B) homeotic genes of the Bithorax complex are responsible for the development of body segments in Drosophila melanogaster. Their regulatory region of approximately 300 kb harbors a series of specific enhancers, each regulating expression in a single parasegment. Molecular genetic analysis of the Abd-B gene revealed the regulatory modules MCP, Fab-7, and Fab-8, which contain insulators with adjacent silencers. The present work was aimed at searching for similar regulatory elements in the promoter regions of the Abd-A and Abd-B genes and new regulatory modules in the Abd-B gene region. Four DNA fragments, each containing numerous specific sequences characteristic of regulatory modules, were tested for the ability to suppress transcription of the yellow and white genes and for the interaction with MCP. The DNA fragment of the Abd-A promoter region proved to act as an effective silencer. The fragment of the iab4 domain showed insulator properties. The fragment of the Abd-B promoter region interacted with MCP in providing for communication between the enhancer and promoter of the white gene.",2004,"E S Mel'nik, O V Kyrchanova, N M Gruzdeva, P G Georgiev, E S Mel'nik, O V Kyrchanova, N M Gruzdeva, P G Georgiev"
Parasite-specific immune response in adult Drosophila melanogaster: a genomic study,14749722,10.1038/sj.embor.7400073,"Insects of the order Diptera are vectors for parasitic diseases such as malaria, sleeping sickness and leishmania. In the search for genes encoding proteins involved in the antiparasitic response, we have used the protozoan parasite Octosporea muscaedomesticae for oral infections of adult Drosophila melanogaster. To identify parasite-specific response molecules, other flies were exposed to virus, bacteria or fungi in parallel. Analysis of gene expression patterns after 24 h of microbial challenge, using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays, revealed a high degree of microbe specificity. Many serine proteases, key intermediates in the induction of insect immune responses, were uniquely expressed following infection of the different organisms. Several lysozyme genes were induced in response to Octosporea infection, while in other treatments they were not induced or downregulated. This suggests that lysozymes are important in antiparasitic defence.",2004,"Katarina RoxstrÃ¶m-Lindquist, Olle Terenius, Ingrid Faye, Katarina RoxstrÃ¶m-Lindquist, Olle Terenius, Ingrid Faye"

Coupled oscillators control morning and evening locomotor behaviour of Drosophila,15483615,10.1038/nature02926,"Daily rhythms of physiology and behaviour are precisely timed by an endogenous circadian clock. These include separate bouts of morning and evening activity, characteristic of Drosophila melanogaster and many other taxa, including mammals. Whereas multiple oscillators have long been proposed to orchestrate such complex behavioural programmes, their nature and interplay have remained elusive. By using cell-specific ablation, we show that the timing of morning and evening activity in Drosophila derives from two distinct groups of circadian neurons: morning activity from the ventral lateral neurons that express the neuropeptide PDF, and evening activity from another group of cells, including the dorsal lateral neurons. Although the two oscillators can function autonomously, cell-specific rescue experiments with circadian clock mutants indicate that they are functionally coupled.",2004,"Dan Stoleru, Ying Peng, JosÃ© Agosto, Michael Rosbash, Dan Stoleru, Ying Peng, JosÃ© Agosto, Michael Rosbash"

Molecular evolution of X-linked accessory gland proteins in Drosophila pseudoobscura,15073226,10.1093/jhered/esh027,"In Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, positive Darwinian selection drives high rates of evolution of male reproductive genes, and accessory gland proteins (Acps) in particular. Here, we tested whether 13 X-linked male-specific genes, 4 Acps and 9 non-Acps, are under selective forces in the Drosophila pseudoobscura species group, much as those in the D. melanogaster group. We observed a statistically significant correlation in relative rates of nonsynonymous evolution between the two species groups tested. One Acp examined had a higher rate of nonsynonymous substitution than predicted by a neutral model in both species groups, suggesting its divergence was driven by positive Darwinian selection. To further test for the signature of selection, we examined polymorphism of three Acps within D. pseudoobscura. From this test, no Acp individually bore the signature of positive selection, but the 3 Acps together possessed an excess of nonsynonymous differences between species, relative to polymorphism within species. We conclude that faster evolution of Acps in the D. pseudoobscura group appears to be driven by positive selection, as previously suggested in the D. melanogaster group.",2004,"L S Stevison, B A Counterman, M A F Noor"
Insecticidal effect of phthalides and furanocoumarins from Angelica acutiloba against Drosophila melanogaster,15237943,10.1021/jf0497049,"Insecticidal activity of Angelica acutiloba extract and its constituents was investigated and compared with that of rotenone. Bioassay-guided isolation of the chloroform extract of A. acutiloba against larvae of Drosophila melanogaster afforded two phthalides, (Z)-butylidenephthalide (1) and (Z)-ligustilide (2), and two furanocoumarins, xanthotoxin (3) and isopimpinellin (4). The structures of these compounds were established by spectroscopic analysis. The isolated compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 exhibited LC(50) values of 0.94, 2.54, 3.35, and 0.82 micromol/mL of diet concentration against larvae of D. melanogaster, respectively. Against both sexes (males/females, 1:1) of adults (5-7 days old), compound 1 showed the most potent activity with a LD(50) value of 0.84 microg/adult. Compound 1 is a more active insecticide than rotenone (LD(50) = 3.68 microg/adult) and has potential as a novel insect control agent. However, compound 2 was inactive against adults. The structure-activity relationship of phthalides isolated indicated that the aromaticity appeared to play an important role in the activity of both larvae and adults. To determine the insecticide mode of action for acute adulticidal activity, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity was also investigated in vitro, and the result indicated that the acute adulticidal activity of compounds 3 and 4 was due to the inhibition of AChE.",2004,"Mitsuo Miyazawa, Toshihiko Tsukamoto, Jun Anzai, Yukio Ishikawa, Mitsuo Miyazawa, Toshihiko Tsukamoto, Jun Anzai, Yukio Ishikawa"
Molecular mapping of deletion breakpoints on chromosome 4 of Drosophila melanogaster,15185094,10.1007/s00412-004-0286-4,"As part of our effort to induce and identify mutations in all genes on chromosome 4 of Drosophila melanogaster, we have mapped the breakpoints of eight chromosome 4 deficiencies relative to the predicted genes along this chromosome.

Polymerase chain reaction primers were designed to amplify the predicted exons of all chromosome 4 genes, and homozygous embryos for each deficiency were identified and their DNA used to test for the presence or absence of these exons. By testing for the inability to amplify various exons along the length of the chromosome, we were able to determine which predicted genes are missing in each deficiency. The five deficiencies, Df(4)G, Df(4)C3, Df(4)C1-10AT, and Df(4)B2-20 (all terminal deletions), and Df(4)M101-62f (a proximal interstitial deletion), enabled us to partition the gene-containing, right arm of chromosome 4 into five regions. Region A [uncovered by Df(4)M101-62f] contains the proximal-most 21 genes; region B [uncovered by Df(4)B2-2D] contains the next 12 genes; region C [uncovered by Df(4)B2-2D and Df(4)C1-10AT] contains the next 17 genes; region D [uncovered by Df(4)B2-2D, Df(4)C1-10AT, and Df(4)C3] contains the next 21 genes; and region E [uncovered by Df(4)B2-2D, Df(4)C1-10AT, Df(4)C3, and Df(4)G] contains the distal-most ten genes. By using Df(4)M101-62f, Df(4)B2-2D, Df(4)C1-10AT, Df(4)C3, and Df(4)G in complementation tests, we can assign newly induced recessive lethal mutations to one of the five regions on chromosome 4.

The calpain superfamily consists of 14 genes in mammals, but only 4 genes in Drosophila.

Results reported here show that two functionally distinct and independent RNA domains control the production of gypsy encoded proteins. The first domain corresponds to the 5' UTR of the env subgenomic RNA and exhibits features of an efficient IRES (IRES(E)) both in the reticulocyte lysate and in cells. The second RNA domain that encompasses the gypsy insulator can function as an IRES in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate but strongly represses translation in cultured cells.

Little is known about the molecular events linking receptor activation to cytoskeletal rearrangements during cell migration. We have performed a functional characterization of Downstream-of-FGFR (Dof), a putative adapter protein that acts specifically in FGFR signal transduction in Drosophila. By combining reverse genetic, cell culture, and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that Dof is a specific substrate for the two Drosophila FGFRs. After defining a minimal Dof rescue protein, we identify two regions important for Dof function in mesodermal and tracheal cell migration. The N-terminal 484 amino acids are strictly required for the interaction of Dof with the FGFRs. Upon receptor activation, tyrosine residue 515 becomes phosphorylated and recruits the phosphatase Corkscrew (Csw). Csw recruitment represents an essential step in FGF-induced cell migration and in the activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway. However, our results also indicate that the activation of Ras is not sufficient to activate the migration machinery in tracheal and mesodermal cells. Additional proteins binding either to the FGFRs, to Dof, or to Csw appear to be crucial for a chemotactic response.",2004,"ValÃ©rie Petit, Ute Nussbaumer, Caroline Dossenbach, Markus Affolter, ValÃ©rie Petit, Ute Nussbaumer, Caroline Dossenbach, Markus Affolter"

In a survey for young genes in species of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we identified a young gene family, monkey king, whose genesis sheds light on the evolutionary process of gene fission. Its members originated 1-2 million years ago as retroposed duplicates and evolved into fission genes that separately encode protein domains from a multidomain ancestor.

p120 Ras GTPase-activating protein associates with fibroblast growth factor receptors in Drosophila,15030317,10.1042/BJ20031848,"Btl (breathless) and Htl (heartless), the two FGFRs (fibroblast growth factor receptors) in Drosophila melanogaster, control cell migration and differentiation in the developing embryo. These receptors signal through the conserved Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, but how they regulate Ras activity is not known. The present study shows that there is a direct interaction between p120 RasGAP (Ras GTPase-activating protein), a negative regulator of Ras, and activated FGFRs in Drosophila. The interaction is dependent on the SH2 (Src homology 2) domains of RasGAP, which have been shown to interact with a phosphotyrosine residue within the consensus sequence (phospho)YXXPXD. A potential binding site that matches this consensus is found in both Btl and Htl, located between the transmembrane and kinase domains of each receptor. A peptide corresponding to this region was capable of binding RasGAP only when the tyrosine residue was phosphorylated. This tyrosine residue appears to be conserved in human FGFR-1 and mediates the association with the adapter protein CrkII, but no association between dCrk (Drosophila homologue of CrkII) and the activated FGFRs was detected. RasGAP was a substrate of the activated FGFR kinase domain, and mutation of the tyrosine residue within the potential binding site on the receptor prevented tyrosine phosphorylation of RasGAP. RasGAP attenuated FGFR signalling in vivo and this ability was dependent on both its SH2 domains and its GAP activity. On the basis of these results, we propose that RasGAP is directly recruited into activated FGFRs in Drosophila and plays a role in regulating the strength of signalling through Ras and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.",2004,"Simon A Woodcock, David A Hughes, Simon A Woodcock, David A Hughes"
Patterns of evolutionary constraints in intronic and intergenic DNA of Drosophila,14762063,10.1101/gr.1329204,"We develop methods to infer levels of evolutionary constraints in the genome by comparing rates of nucleotide substitution in noncoding DNA with rates predicted from rates of synonymous site evolution in adjacent genes or other putatively neutrally evolving sites, while accounting for differences in base composition. We apply the methods to estimate levels of constraint in noncoding DNA of Drosophila. In introns, constraint (the estimated fraction of mutations that are selectively eliminated) is absolute at the 5' and 3' splice junction dinucleotides, and averages 72% in base pairs 3-6 at the 5'-end. Constraint at the 5' base pairs 3-6 is significantly lower in the lineage leading to Drosophila melanogaster than in Drosophila simulans, a finding that agrees with other features of genome evolution in Drosophila and indicates that the effect of selection on intron function has been weaker in the melanogaster lineage. Elsewhere in intron sequences, the rate of nucleotide substitution is significantly higher than at synonymous sites. By using intronic sites outside splice control regions as a putative neutrally evolving standard, constraint in the 500 bp of intergenic DNA upstream and downstream regions of protein-coding genes averages approximately 44%. Although the estimated level of constraint in intergenic regions close to genes is only about one-half of that of amino acid sites, selection against single-nucleotide mutations in intergenic DNA makes a substantial contribution to the mutation load in Drosophila.",2004,"Daniel L Halligan, Adam Eyre-Walker, Peter Andolfatto, Peter D Keightley, Daniel L Halligan, Adam Eyre-Walker, Peter Andolfatto, Peter D Keightley"

The level of DNA damage (alkali-labile sites (ALS), single-strand (SSB) and double-strand (DSB) breaks) in cells of somatic (nerve ganglia, imaginal discs) and generative (testis) tissues from directly irradiated animals and their unirradiated offspring was evaluated. Confident transgenerational instability (on the level of ALSs and SSBs), observed only in somatic tissues and only at the higher dose rate, is characteristic for mus209 mutant strains defective in excision repair and, less often, for mus205 and mus210 mutant strains. The greatest manifestation of radiation-induced genetic instability was found in evaluating the DSBs. Dysfunction of the genes mus205, mus304, mei-9 and mei-41, which are responsible for postreplicative repair, excision repair, recombination and control of the cell cycle, affects transgenerational changes in the somatic tissues of the offspring of parents irradiated in both low and high dose rates. In germ cells, the key role in maintaining genetic stability under chronic irradiation is played by the non-recombination postreplication repair mus101 gene.

We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with six genes with a significant (p < 10-08, corresponding to a false discovery rate of 2.4%) association with survival, none of which were canonical immune genes. To validate the role of these genes in immune defense, their expression was knocked-down using RNAi and survival of infected hosts was followed, which confirmed a role for the genes krishah and S6k in immune defense. We further identified a putative role for the Bomanin gene BomBc1 (also known as IM23), in E. faecalis infection response. This study adds to the growing set of association studies for infection in Drosophila melanogaster and suggests that the genetic causes of variation in immune defense differ for different pathogens.",2020,"Joanne R Chapman, Maureen A Dowell, Rosanna Chan, Robert L Unckless, Joanne R Chapman, Maureen A Dowell, Rosanna Chan, Robert L Unckless"
"Damage-responsive, maturity-silenced enhancers regulate multiple genes that direct regeneration in Drosophila",32490812,10.7554/eLife.58305,"Like tissues of many organisms, Drosophila imaginal discs lose the ability to regenerate as they mature. This loss of regenerative capacity coincides with reduced damage-responsive expression of multiple genes needed for regeneration. We previously showed that two such genes, wg and Wnt6, are regulated by a single damage-responsive enhancer that becomes progressively inactivated via Polycomb-mediated silencing as discs mature (Harris et al., 2016). Here we explore the generality of this mechanism and identify additional damage-responsive, maturity-silenced (DRMS) enhancers, some near genes known to be required for regeneration such as Mmp1, and others near genes that we now show function in regeneration. Using a novel GAL4-independent ablation system we characterize two DRMS-associated genes, apontic (apt), which curtails regeneration and CG9752/asperous (aspr), which promotes it. This mechanism of suppressing regeneration by silencing damage-responsive enhancers at multiple loci can be partially overcome by reducing activity of the chromatin regulator extra sex combs (esc).",2020,"Robin E Harris, Michael J Stinchfield, Spencer L Nystrom, Daniel J McKay, Iswar K Hariharan, Robin E Harris, Michael J Stinchfield, Spencer L Nystrom, Daniel J McKay, Iswar K Hariharan"
Unravelling the genetic basis for the rapid diversification of male genitalia between Drosophila species,32931587,10.1093/molbev/msaa232,"In the last 240,000 years, males of the Drosophila simulans species clade have evolved striking differences in the morphology of their epandrial posterior lobes and claspers (surstyli). These appendages are used for grasping the female during mating and so their divergence is most likely driven by sexual selection. Mapping studies indicate a highly polygenic and generally additive genetic basis for these morphological differences. However, we have limited understanding of the gene regulatory networks that control the development of genital structures and how they evolved to result in this rapid phenotypic diversification. Here, we used new D. simulans/D. mauritiana introgression lines on chromosome 3L to generate higher resolution maps of posterior lobe and clasper differences between these species. We then carried out RNA-seq on the developing genitalia of both species to identify the expressed genes and those that are differentially expressed between the two species. This allowed us to test the function of expressed positional candidates during genital development in D. melanogaster. We identified several new genes involved in the development and possibly the evolution of these genital structures, including the transcription factors Hairy and Grunge. Furthermore, we discovered that during clasper development Hairy negatively regulates tartan (trn), a gene known to contribute to divergence in clasper morphology. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the regulation of genital development and how this has evolved between species.",2020,"Joanna F D Hagen, ClÃ¡udia C Mendes, Shamma R Booth, Javier Figueras Jimenez, Kentaro M Tanaka, Franziska A Franke, Luis Baudouin-Gonzalez, Amber M Ridgway, Saad Arif, Maria D S Nunes, Alistair P McGregor, Joanna F D Hagen, ClÃ¡udia C Mendes, Shamma R Booth, Javier Figueras Jimenez, Kentaro M Tanaka, Franziska A Franke, Luis Baudouin-Gonzalez, Amber M Ridgway, Saad Arif, Maria D S Nunes, Alistair P McGregor"
Cellular and synaptic adaptations of neural circuits processing skylight polarization in the fly,31811399,10.1007/s00359-019-01389-3,"Specialized ommatidia harboring polarization-sensitive photoreceptors exist in the 'dorsal rim area' (DRA) of virtually all insects. Although downstream elements have been described both anatomically and physiologically throughout the optic lobes and the central brain of different species, little is known about their cellular and synaptic adaptations and how these shape their functional role in polarization vision. We have previously shown that in the DRA of Drosophila melanogaster, two distinct types of modality-specific 'distal medulla' cell types (Dm-DRA1 and Dm-DRA2) are post-synaptic to long visual fiber photoreceptors R7 and R8, respectively. Here we describe additional neuronal elements in the medulla neuropil that manifest modality-specific differences in the DRA region, including DRA-specific neuronal morphology, as well as differences in the structure of pre- or post-synaptic membranes. Furthermore, we show that certain cell types (medulla tangential cells and octopaminergic neuromodulatory cells) specifically avoid contacts with polarization-sensitive photoreceptors. Finally, while certain transmedullary cells are specifically absent from DRA medulla columns, other subtypes show specific wiring differences while still connecting the DRA to the lobula complex, as has previously been described in larger insects.

The peptidome of the selected nervous tissues of adult D. suzukii was investigated as a first step in identifying potential targets for the development of novel insecticides. Through in silico analyses of the D. suzukii genome databases 28 neuropeptide families, comprising more than 70 predicted peptides were identified. Using a combination of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry of tissue extracts, 33 predicted peptides, representing 15 different peptide families were identified by their molecular masses and a total of 17 peptide sequences were confirmed by ion fragmentation. A comparison between the peptides and precursors of D. suzukii and D. melanogaster shows they are highly conserved, with differences only identified in the amino acid sequences of the peptides encoded in the FMRFamide, hugin and ecydysis triggering hormone precursors. All other peptides predicted and identified from D. suzukii appear to be identical to those previously characterized from D. melanogaster. Adipokinetic hormone was only identified in the corpus cardiacum, other peptides present included short neuropeptide F, a pyrokinin and myosuppressin, the latter of which was the only peptide identified from the crop nerve bundle.

Vesicle-Mediated Steroid Hormone Secretion in Drosophila melanogaster,26544939,10.1016/j.cell.2015.10.022,"Steroid hormones are a large family of cholesterol derivatives regulating development and physiology in both the animal and plant kingdoms, but little is known concerning mechanisms of their secretion from steroidogenic tissues. Here, we present evidence that in Drosophila, endocrine release of the steroid hormone ecdysone is mediated through a regulated vesicular trafficking mechanism. Inhibition of calcium signaling in the steroidogenic prothoracic gland results in the accumulation of unreleased ecdysone, and the knockdown of calcium-mediated vesicle exocytosis components in the gland caused developmental defects due to deficiency of ecdysone. Accumulation of synaptotagmin-labeled vesicles in the gland is observed when calcium signaling is disrupted, and these vesicles contain an ABC transporter that functions as an ecdysone pump to fill vesicles. We propose that trafficking of steroid hormones out of endocrine cells is not always through a simple diffusion mechanism as presently thought, but instead can involve a regulated vesicle-mediated release process.",2015,"Naoki Yamanaka, Guillermo MarquÃ©s, Michael B O'Connor, Naoki Yamanaka, Guillermo MarquÃ©s, Michael B O'Connor"

Dosage compensation acts on thousands of genes with disparate expression patterns. Both flies and mammals accomplish this with remarkable specificity by targeting epigenetic chromatin modifications to a single chromosome. Long noncoding RNAs that are expressed from the X chromosome are essential elements of the targeting mechanism in both lineages. We recently discovered that the siRNA pathway, as well as small RNA from satellite repeats that are strikingly enriched on the fly X chromosome, also promote X recognition.

Drosophila circadian rhythms in seminatural environments: Summer afternoon component is not an artifact and requires TrpA1 channels,26124142,10.1073/pnas.1506093112,"Under standard laboratory conditions of rectangular light/dark cycles and constant warm temperature, Drosophila melanogaster show bursts of morning (M) and evening (E) locomotor activity and a ""siesta"" in the middle of the day. These M and E components have been critical for developing the neuronal dual oscillator model in which clock gene expression in key cells generates the circadian phenotype. However, under natural European summer conditions of cycling temperature and light intensity, an additional prominent afternoon (A) component that replaces the siesta is observed. This component has been described as an ""artifact"" of the TriKinetics locomotor monitoring system that is used by many circadian laboratories world wide. Using video recordings, we show that the A component is not an artifact, neither in the glass tubes used in TriKinetics monitors nor in open-field arenas. By studying various mutants in the visual and peripheral and internal thermo-sensitive pathways, we reveal that the M component is predominantly dependent on visual input, whereas the A component requires the internal thermo-sensitive channel transient receptor potential A1 (TrpA1). Knockdown of TrpA1 in different neuronal groups reveals that the reported expression of TrpA1 in clock neurons is unlikely to be involved in generating the summer locomotor profile, suggesting that other TrpA1 neurons are responsible for the A component.

Efficacy of methuselah gene mutation toward tolerance of dichlorvos exposure in Drosophila melanogaster,25746179,10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.02.025,"Adverse reports on the exposure of organisms to dichlorvos (DDVP; an organophosphate insecticide) necessitate studies of organismal resistance/tolerance by way of pharmacological or genetic means. In the context of genetic modulation, a mutation in methuselah (mth; encodes a class II G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)) is reported to extend (~35%) the life span of Drosophila melanogaster and enhance their resistance to oxidative stress induced by paraquat exposure (short term, high level). A lack of studies on organismal tolerance of DDVP by genetic modulation prompted us to examine the protective efficacy of mth mutation in exposed Drosophila. Flies were exposed to 1.5 and 15.0 ng/ml DDVP for 12-48 h to examine oxidative stress endpoints and chemical resistance. After prolonged exposure of flies to DDVP, antioxidant enzyme activities, oxidative stress, glutathione content, and locomotor performance were assayed at various days (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50) of age. Flies with the mth mutation (mth(1)) showed improved chemical resistance and rescued redox impairment after acute DDVP exposure. Exposed mth(1) flies exhibited improved life span along with enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities and rescued oxidative perturbations and locomotor insufficiency up to middle age (~20 days) over similarly exposed w(1118) flies. However, at late (??0 days) age, these benefits were undermined. Further, similarly exposed mth-knockdown flies showed effects similar to those observed in mth(1) flies.

The silkworm glutathione S-transferase gene noppera-bo is required for ecdysteroid biosynthesis and larval development,25881968,10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.04.001,"Insect molting and metamorphosis are tightly controlled by ecdysteroids, which are important steroid hormones that are synthesized from dietary sterols in the prothoracic gland. One of the ecdysteroidogenic genes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is noppera-bo (nobo), also known as GSTe14, which encodes a member of the epsilon class of glutathione S-transferases. In D. melanogaster, nobo plays a crucial role in utilizing cholesterol via regulating its transport and/or metabolism in the prothoracic gland. However, it is still not known whether the orthologs of nobo from other insects are also involved in ecdysteroid biosynthesis via cholesterol transport and/or metabolism in the prothoracic gland. Here we report genetic evidence showing that the silkworm Bombyx mori ortholog of nobo (nobo-Bm; GSTe7) is essential for silkworm development. nobo-Bm is predominantly expressed in the prothoracic gland. To assess the functional importance of nobo-Bm, we generated a B. mori genetic mutant of nobo-Bm using TALEN-mediated genome editing. We show that loss of nobo-Bm function causes larval arrest and a glossy cuticle phenotype, which are rescued by the application of 20-hydroxyecdysone. Moreover, the prothoracic gland cells isolated from the nobo-Bm mutant exhibit an abnormal accumulation of 7-dehydrocholesterol, a cholesterol metabolite. These results suggest that the nobo family of glutathione S-transferases is essential for development and for the regulation of sterol utilization in the prothoracic gland in not only the Diptera but also the Lepidoptera. On the other hand, loss of nobo function mutants of D. melanogaster and B. mori abnormally accumulates different sterols, implying that the sterol utilization in the PG is somewhat different between these two insect species.",2015,"Sora Enya, Takaaki Daimon, Fumihiko Igarashi, Hiroshi Kataoka, Miwa Uchibori, Hideki Sezutsu, Tetsuro Shinoda, Ryusuke Niwa, Sora Enya, Takaaki Daimon, Fumihiko Igarashi, Hiroshi Kataoka, Miwa Uchibori, Hideki Sezutsu, Tetsuro Shinoda, Ryusuke Niwa"
Oxygen changes drive non-uniform scaling in Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis,26673611,10.12688/f1000research.7221.1,"We previously demonstrated that, while changes in temperature produce dramatic shifts in the time elapsed during Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis, the relative timing of events within embryogenesis does not change. However, it was unclear if this uniform scaling is an intrinsic property of developing embryos, or if it is specific to thermal fluctuations. To investigate this, here we characterize the embryonic response to changes in oxygen concentration, which also impact developmental rate, using time-lapse imaging, and find it fundamentally different from the temperature response. Most notably, changes in oxygen levels drive developmental heterochrony, with the timing of several morphological processes showing distinct scaling behaviors. Gut formation is severely slowed by decreases in oxygen, while head involution and syncytial development are less impacted than the rest of development, and the order of several developmental landmarks is inverted at different oxygen levels. These data reveal that the uniform scaling seen with changes in temperature is not a trivial consequence of adjusting developmental rate. The developmental rate changes produced by changing oxygen concentrations dwarf those induced by temperature, and greatly impact survival. While extreme temperatures increase early embryo mortality, mild hypoxia increases arrest and death during mid-embryogenesis and mild hyperoxia increases survival over normoxia.",2015,"Steven G Kuntz, Michael B Eisen, Steven G Kuntz, Michael B Eisen"

Cryptochrome-dependent and -independent circadian entrainment circuits in Drosophila,25878285,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0070-15.2015,"Entrainment to environmental light/dark (LD) cycles is a central function of circadian clocks. In Drosophila, entrainment is achieved by Cryptochrome (CRY) and input from the visual system. During activation by brief light pulses, CRY triggers the degradation of TIMELESS and subsequent shift in circadian phase. This is less important for LD entrainment, leading to questions regarding light input circuits and mechanisms from the visual system. Recent studies show that different subsets of brain pacemaker clock neurons, the morning (M) and evening (E) oscillators, have distinct functions in light entrainment. However, the role of CRY in M and E oscillators for entrainment to LD cycles is unknown. Here, we address this question by selectively expressing CRY in different subsets of clock neurons in a cry-null (cry(0)) mutant background. We were able to rescue the light entrainment deficits of cry(0) mutants by expressing CRY in E oscillators but not in any other clock neurons. Par domain protein 1 molecular oscillations in the E, but not M, cells of cry(0) mutants still responded to the LD phase delay. This residual light response was stemming from the visual system because it disappeared when all external photoreceptors were ablated genetically.

In the present study, we explored the in vivo genotoxic activity of TiO2 NPs as well as their TiO2 bulk form using two well-established genotoxic assays, the wing spot test and the comet assay in Drosophila melanogaster. To determine the extent of tissue damage induced by TiO2 NPs in Drosophila larvae, the trypan blue dye exclusion test was also applied. Both compounds were supplied to third instar larvae by ingestion at concentration ranging from 0.08 to 1.60 mg/mL. The results obtained in the present study indicate that TiO2 NPs can reach and induce cytotoxic effects on midgut and imaginal disc tissues of larvae, but they do not promote genotoxicity in the wing-spot test of Drosophila. However, when both nano- and large-size forms of TiO2 were evaluated with the comet assay in Drosophila hemocytes, a significant increase in DNA damage, with a direct dose-response pattern, was observed for TiO2 NPs. The results obtained with the comet assay suggest that the primary DNA damage associated with TiO2 NPs exposure in Drosophila could be associated with specific physico-chemical properties of nano-TiO2, since no effects were observed with the bulk form.

The knirps enhancers exhibit additive, sometimes even super-additive activities, consistent with classical gene fusion studies. In contrast, the hunchback enhancers function sub-additively in anterior regions containing saturating levels of the Bicoid activator, but function additively in regions where there are diminishing levels of the Bicoid gradient.

Photoactivation of cryptochromes from Drosophila melanogaster and Sylvia borin: insight into the chemical compass mechanism by computational investigation,25710635,10.1021/jp508871h,"Although behavioral studies demonstrated light-induced magnetoreception in the insect Drosophila melanogaster, gaining insight into the possibility that a radical-pair mechanism accounts for the magnetic response of the cryptochrome (DmCry1) is complicated by a number of factors. In addition, the mechanism of magnetoreception for the cryptochrome from the garden warbler bird Sylvia borin (gwCry1a), which demonstrated a long-lived radical pair by transient optical absorption measurements, has also not been rationalized. To assess potential feasibility of a radical-pair mechanism in DmCry1 and gwCry1a, formed by excitation and electron transfer between a Trp-triad and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), further separated by electron transfer within the triad, we applied a combination of theoretical methods, including homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) for structure refinement, high-level ab initio theory, and MD simulations using a polarizable force-field for prediction of pKa and the electron transfer rate. Calculated excitation energies, followed by electron transfer in model compounds of DmCry1 that assume proton transfer in conjunction with electron transfer from Trp (W420) to FAD and the predicted pKa for the proximate residue to FAD (Cys416), support a radical-pair mechanism. Furthermore, free-energy and reorganization energies for the Trp-triad in DmCry1 demonstrate facile electron transfer, explained by the local protein environment and exposure to solvent, which in turn enables a large enough distance separation for the radical-pair partners. Results for gwCry1a demonstrated the importance of accounting for relaxed excited-state geometries in validating the first stage of a radical-pair mechanism.

To determine how Wolbachia was able to alter aggressive behavior, we investigated the role of octopamine, a neurotransmitter known to influence male aggressive behavior in many insect species. Transcriptional analysis of the octopamine biosynthesis pathway revealed that two essential genes, the tyrosine decarboxylase and tyramine Î²-hydroxylase genes, were significantly downregulated in Wolbachia-infected flies. Quantitative chemical analysis also showed that total octopamine levels were significantly reduced in the adult heads.",2015,"Chelsie E Rohrscheib, Elizabeth Bondy, Peter Josh, Markus Riegler, Darryl Eyles, Bruno van Swinderen, Michael W Weible 2nd, Jeremy C Brownlie, Chelsie E Rohrscheib, Elizabeth Bondy, Peter Josh, Markus Riegler, Darryl Eyles, Bruno van Swinderen, Michael W Weible 2nd, Jeremy C Brownlie"
Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans as Discovery Platforms for Genes Involved in Human Alcohol Use Disorder,26173477,10.1111/acer.12785,"Background:
      
    

    
      Despite the profound clinical significance and strong heritability of alcohol use disorder (AUD), we do not yet have a comprehensive understanding of the naturally occurring genetic variance within the human genome that drives its development. This lack of understanding is likely to be due in part to the large phenotypic and genetic heterogeneities that underlie human AUD. As a complement to genetic studies in humans, many laboratories are using the invertebrate model organisms (iMOs) Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) and Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode worm) to identify genetic mechanisms that influence the effects of alcohol (ethanol) on behavior. While these extremely powerful models have identified many genes that influence the behavioral responses to alcohol, in most cases it has remained unclear whether results from behavioral-genetic studies in iMOs are directly applicable to understanding the genetic basis of human AUD.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      In this review, we critically evaluate the utility of the fly and worm models for identifying genes that influence AUD in humans.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Based on results published through early 2015, studies in flies and worms have identified 91 and 50 genes, respectively, that influence 1 or more aspects of behavioral responses to alcohol. Collectively, these fly and worm genes correspond to 293 orthologous genes in humans. Intriguingly, 51 of these 293 human genes have been implicated in AUD by at least 1 study in human populations.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our analyses strongly suggest that the Drosophila and C. elegans models have considerable utility for identifying orthologs of genes that influence human AUD.",2015,"Mike Grotewiel, Jill C Bettinger, Mike Grotewiel, Jill C Bettinger"

Variation in Drosophila melanogaster central metabolic genes appears driven by natural selection both within and between populations,25520361,10.1098/rspb.2014.2688,"In this report, we examine the hypothesis that the drivers of latitudinal selection observed in the eastern US Drosophila melanogaster populations are reiterated within seasons in a temperate orchard population in Pennsylvania, USA. Specifically, we ask whether alleles that are apparently favoured in northern populations are also favoured early in the spring, and decrease in frequency from the spring to autumn with the population expansion. We use SNP data collected for 46 metabolic genes and 128 SNPs representing the central metabolic pathway and examine for the aggregate SNP allele frequencies whether the association of allele change with latitude and that with increasing days of spring-autumn season are reversed. Testing by random permutation, we observe a highly significant negative correlation between these associations that is consistent with this expectation. This correlation is stronger when we confine our analysis to only those alleles that show significant latitudinal changes. This pattern is not caused by association with chromosomal inversions. When data are resampled using SNPs for amino acid change the relationship is not significant but is supported when SNPs associated with cis-expression are only considered. Our results suggest that climate factors driving latitudinal molecular variation in a metabolic pathway are related to those operating on a seasonal level within populations.",2015,"Rodrigo Cogni, Kate Kuczynski, Erik Lavington, Spencer Koury, Emily L Behrman, Katherine R O'Brien, Paul S Schmidt, Walter F Eanes, Rodrigo Cogni, Kate Kuczynski, Erik Lavington, Spencer Koury, Emily L Behrman, Katherine R O'Brien, Paul S Schmidt, Walter F Eanes"
"Vilya, a component of the recombination nodule, is required for meiotic double-strand break formation in Drosophila",26452093,10.7554/eLife.08287,"Meiotic recombination begins with the induction of programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs). In most organisms only a fraction of DSBs become crossovers. Here we report a novel meiotic gene, vilya, which encodes a protein with homology to Zip3-like proteins shown to determine DSB fate in other organisms. Vilya is required for meiotic DSB formation, perhaps as a consequence of its interaction with the DSB accessory protein Mei-P22, and localizes to those DSB sites that will mature into crossovers. In early pachytene Vilya localizes along the central region of the synaptonemal complex and to discrete foci. The accumulation of Vilya at foci is dependent on DSB formation. Immuno-electron microscopy demonstrates that Vilya is a component of recombination nodules, which mark the sites of crossover formation. Thus Vilya links the mechanism of DSB formation to either the selection of those DSBs that will become crossovers or to the actual process of crossing over.",2015,"Cathleen M Lake, Rachel J Nielsen, Fengli Guo, Jay R Unruh, Brian D Slaughter, R Scott Hawley, Cathleen M Lake, Rachel J Nielsen, Fengli Guo, Jay R Unruh, Brian D Slaughter, R Scott Hawley"

"Heixuedian (heix), a potential melanotic tumor suppressor gene, exhibits specific spatial and temporal expression pattern during Drosophila hematopoiesis",25530181,10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.12.001,"The Drosophila heixuedian (heix) is the ortholog of human UBIAD1 gene (a.k.a TERE1). The protein product of UBIAD1/heix has multiple enzymatic activities, including the vitamin K2 and the non-mitochondrial CoQ10 biosynthesis. However, the expression pattern of UBIAD1/Heix during metazoan development has not been systematically studied. In this paper, we found that loss of function of heix resulted in pathological changes of larval hematopoietic system, including lymph gland hypertrophy, hemocyte overproliferation and aberrant differentiation, and melanin mass formation. Overexpression of heix cDNA under the tubulin Gal4 driver rescued the above hematopoietic defects. Interestingly, Heix was specifically expressed in plasmatocyte/macrophage lineage in srp driven EGFP positive cells on the head mesoderm during embryogenesis, while it was highly expressed in crystal cells in the primary lobes of the third instar larval lymph gland. Using qRT-PCR analysis, loss of function of heix caused aberrant activation of multiple hemocyte proliferation-related as well as immune-related pathways, including JAK/STAT pathway, Ras/MAPK pathway, IMD pathway and Toll pathway. These data suggested that heix is a potential melanotic tumor suppressor gene and plays a pivotal role in both hemocytes proliferation and differentiation in Drosophila.",2015,"Yan Xia, Samira Zohra Midoun, Zhiliang Xu, Ling Hong, Yan Xia, Samira Zohra Midoun, Zhiliang Xu, Ling Hong"

Plasma membrane overgrowth causes fibrotic collagen accumulation and immune activation in Drosophila adipocytes,26090908,10.7554/eLife.07187,"Many chronic diseases are associated with fibrotic deposition of Collagen and other matrix proteins. Little is known about the factors that determine preferential onset of fibrosis in particular tissues. Here we show that plasma membrane (PM) overgrowth causes pericellular Collagen accumulation in Drosophila adipocytes. We found that loss of Dynamin and other endocytic components causes pericellular trapping of outgoing Collagen IV due to dramatic cortex expansion when endocytic removal of PM is prevented. Deposits also form in the absence of negative Toll immune regulator Cactus, excess PM being caused in this case by increased secretion. Finally, we show that trimeric Collagen accumulation, downstream of Toll or endocytic defects, activates a tissue damage response. Our work indicates that traffic imbalances and PM topology may contribute to fibrosis.

Morphogenesis of the somatic musculature in Drosophila melanogaster,25758712,10.1002/wdev.180,"In Drosophila melanogaster, the somatic muscle system is first formed during embryogenesis, giving rise to the larval musculature. Later during metamorphosis, this system is destroyed and replaced by an entirely new set of muscles in the adult fly. Proper formation of the larval and adult muscles is critical for basic survival functions such as hatching and crawling (in the larva), walking and flying (in the adult), and feeding (at both larval and adult stages). Myogenesis, from mononucleated muscle precursor cells to multinucleated functional muscles, is driven by a number of cellular processes that have begun to be mechanistically defined. Once the mesodermal cells destined for the myogenic lineage have been specified, individual myoblasts fuse together iteratively to form syncytial myofibers. Combining cytoplasmic contents demands a level of intracellular reorganization that, most notably, leads to redistribution of the myonuclei to maximize internuclear distance. Signaling from extending myofibers induces terminal tendon cell differentiation in the ectoderm, which results in secure muscle-tendon attachments that are critical for muscle contraction. Simultaneously, muscles become innervated and undergo sarcomerogenesis to establish the contractile apparatus that will facilitate movement. The cellular mechanisms governing these morphogenetic events share numerous parallels to mammalian development, and the basic unit of all muscle, the myofiber, is conserved from flies to mammals. Thus, studies of Drosophila myogenesis and comparisons to muscle development in other systems highlight conserved regulatory programs of biomedical relevance to general muscle biology and studies of muscle disease.",2015,"Victoria K Schulman, Krista C Dobi, Mary K Baylies, Victoria K Schulman, Krista C Dobi, Mary K Baylies"

A Drosophila Gustatory Receptor Required for Strychnine Sensation,26187906,10.1093/chemse/bjv038,"Strychnine is a potent, naturally occurring neurotoxin that effectively protects plants from animal pests by deterring feeding behavior. In insects, such as the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, bitter-tasting aversive compounds are detected primarily through a family of gustatory receptors (GRs), which are expressed in gustatory receptor neurons. We previously described multiple GRs that eliminate the behavioral avoidance to all bitter compounds tested, with the exception of strychnine. Here, we report the identity of a strychnine receptor, referred to as GR47a. We generated a mutation in Gr47a and found that it eliminated strychnine repulsion and strychnine-induced action potentials. GR47a was narrowly tuned, as the responses to other avoidance compounds were unaffected in the mutant animals. This analysis supports an emerging model that Drosophila GRs fall broadly into two specificity classes-one class is comprised of core receptors that are broadly required, whereas the other class, which includes GR47a, consists of narrowly tuned receptors that define chemical specificity.",2015,"Youngseok Lee, Seok Jun Moon, Yijin Wang, Craig Montell, Youngseok Lee, Seok Jun Moon, Yijin Wang, Craig Montell"
The effects of natural selection across molecular pathways in Drosophila melanogaster,26391223,10.1186/s12862-015-0472-4,"Background:
      
    

    
      Whole-genome RNA interference post-transcriptional silencing (RNAi) is a widely used method for studying the phenotypic effects of knocking down individual genes. In this study, we use a population genomic approach to characterize the rate of evolution for proteins affecting 26 RNAi knockdown phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We find that only two of the 26 RNAi knockdown phenotypes are enriched for rapidly evolving proteins: innate immunity and regulation of Hedgehog signaling. Among all genes associated with an RNAi knockdown phenotype, we note examples in which the adaptively evolving proteins play a well-defined role in a given molecular pathway. However, most adaptively evolving proteins are found to perform more general cellular functions. When RNAi phenotypes are grouped into categories according to cellular function, we find that genes involved in the greatest number of phenotypic categories are also significantly more likely to have a history of rapid protein evolution.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We show that genes that have been demonstrated to have a measurable effect on multiple molecular phenotypes show higher rates of protein evolution than genes having an effect on a single category of phenotype. Defining pleiotropy in this way yields very different results than previous studies that define pleiotropy by the number of physical interactions, which show highly connected proteins tend to evolve more slowly than lowly connected proteins. We suggest that a high degree of pleiotropy may increase the likelihood of compensatory substitution, consistent with modern theoretical work on adaptation.",2015,"Jeffrey P Vedanayagam, Daniel Garrigan, Jeffrey P Vedanayagam, Daniel Garrigan"
Extensive cross-regulation of post-transcriptional regulatory networks in Drosophila,26294687,10.1101/gr.182675.114,"In eukaryotic cells, RNAs exist as ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs).

One of the proteins, found at mammalian acrosome, is Hgs, a homologue of Drosophila melanogaster Hrs (Hepatocyte growth factor regulated tyrosine kinase substrate), a known marker of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). However, although Drosophila acrosome was extensively studied, it is yet unknown whether Hrs localizes at acrosome similar to Hgs and, more generally, whether the spectrum of acrosomal proteins in Drosophila is the same as in mammals. Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) is the multidomain vesicular protein participating in the endosome-lysosome protein sorting. We demonstrated that two protein variants of the Drosophila Hrs are expressed in testes: a longer isoform B, and a shorter isoform A, which lacks VHS and FYVE domains that are necessary for anchoring Hrs in endosomes. We found that Hrs isoform B is concentrated at fusoma of spermatocytes in contrast to mammalian Hrs. This localization requires the C-terminus of the protein, starting from the aminoacid residue 383. In situ hybridization of hrs RNA probe showed that the gene is expressed early in spermatogenesis consistently with Hrs localization in early fusoma.

Evidence for horizontal transfer of Wolbachia by a Drosophila mite,25921489,10.1007/s10493-015-9918-z,"Mites are common ectoparasites of Drosophila and have been implicated in bacterial and mobile element invasion of Drosophila stocks. The obligate endobacterium, Wolbachia, has widespread effects on gene expression in their arthropod hosts and alters host reproduction to enhance its survival and propagation, often with deleterious effects in Drosophila hosts. To determine whether Wolbachia could be transferred between Drosophila melanogaster laboratory stocks by the mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae, mites were introduced to Wolbachia-infected Drosophila vials. These vials were kept adjacent to mite-free and Wolbachia-uninfected Drosophila stock vials. The Wolbachia infection statuses of the infected and uninfected flies were checked from generation 1 to 5. Results indicate that Wolbachia DNA could be amplified from mites infesting Wolbachia-infected fly stocks and infection in the previously uninfected stocks arose within generation 1 or 2, concomitant with invasion of mites from the Wolbachia-infected stock. A possible mechanism for the transfer of Wolbachia from flies to mites and vice versa, can be inferred from time-lapse photography of fly and mite interactions. We demonstrated that mites ingest Drosophila corpses, including Wolbachia-infected corpses, and Drosophila larva ingest mites, providing possible sources of Wolbachia infection and transfer. This research demonstrated that T. putrescentiae white mites can facilitate Wolbachia transfer between Drosophila stocks and that this may occur by ingestion of infected corpses. Mite-vectored Wolbachia transfer allows for rapid establishment of Wolbachia infection within a new population. This mode of Wolbachia introduction may be relevant in nature as well as in the laboratory, and could have a variety of biological consequences.",2015,"Amy N Brown, Vett K Lloyd, Amy N Brown, Vett K Lloyd"

The results also suggest that the DNA fragments between -112 and -54 and between +94 and +113 contain the vital elements for the expression. The importance of these fragments was further substantiated by the findings that the sequences in these fragments of the D. melanogaster TFIIS gene are conserved in the 5'-flanking regions of the Drosophila virilis TFIIS gene.

Proximodistal domain specification and interactions in developing Drosophila appendages,11493555,,"The morphological diversification of appendages represents a crucial aspect of animal body plan evolution. The arthropod antenna and leg are homologous appendages, thought to have arisen via duplication and divergence of an ancestral structure (Snodgrass, R. (1935) Book Principles of Insect Morphology. New York: McGraw-Hill). To gain insight into how variations between the antenna and the leg may have arisen, we have compared the epistatic relationships among three major proximodistal patterning genes, Distal-less, dachshund and homothorax, in the antenna and leg of the insect arthropod Drosophila melanogaster. We find that Drosophila appendages are subdivided into different proximodistal domains specified by specific genes, and that limb-specific interactions between genes and the functions of these genes are crucial for antenna-leg differences. In particular, in the leg, but not in the antenna, mutually antagonistic interactions exist between the proximal and medial domains, as well as between medial and distal domains. The lack of such antagonism in the antenna leads to extensive coexpression of Distal-less and homothorax, which in turn is essential for differentiation of antennal morphology. Furthermore, we report that a fundamental difference between the two appendages is the presence in the leg and absence in the antenna of a functional medial domain specified by dachshund. Our results lead us to propose that the acquisition of particular proximodistal subdomains and the evolution of their interactions has been essential for the diversification of limb morphology.",2001,"P D Dong, J Chu, G Panganiban, P D Dong, J Chu, G Panganiban"
The genetic bases of divergence in desiccation and starvation resistance among tropical and temperate populations of Drosophila melanogaster,11737283,10.1046/j.1365-2540.2001.00925.x,"Desiccation and starvation resistance are two stress-related traits which vary geographically with climate in Drosophila melanogaster. To investigate the contribution of epistasis to population divergence for these traits, we crossed tropical and temperate populations from two different geographical regions to produce F1, F2 and first backcross generations. Line-cross analysis of generation means revealed that genetic bases of divergence for both traits were complex and remarkably similar in a number of respects. Strong additive and dominance effects were present in most of the models, whereas epistatic and maternal effects were less common. The presence of epistatic effects in approximately half of the models presented in this study is consistent with line-cross studies of diverged traits in other animals, and does not support the view that epistasis is the predominant means by which populations diverge. In addition, evidence of maternal effects in both traits adds to a growing body of recent evidence that suggests maternal contributions to population differentiation are more widespread than previously thought. This finding undermines the accuracy of studies inferring epistasis directly from the magnitude of F2 breakdown. More line-cross analysis studies of naturally diverged populations that take into account maternal effects will shed further light on the true incidence of epistasis and its importance in the evolutionary process.",2001,"W J Kennington, A S Gilchrist, D B Goldstein, L Partridge, W J Kennington, A S Gilchrist, D B Goldstein, L Partridge"
Non-coding snoRNA host genes in Drosophila: expression strategies for modification guide snoRNAs,11302516,10.1078/0171-9335-00150,"Modification guide snoRNAs either are encoded within introns and co-transcribed with the host gene pre-mRNA or are independently transcribed as mono- or polycistronic units. Different eukaryotic kingdoms utilize these coding strategies to various degrees. Intron-encoded and polycistronic snoRNAs are released from primary transcripts as pre-snoRNAs by the spliceosome or by an RNase III-like activity, respectively. In the spliceosomal pathway, the resulting intron lariat is then linearized by a debranching activity. The leader and trailer sequences of pre-snoRNAs are removed by exonucleolytic activities. The majority of snoRNA host genes encode proteins involved in the synthesis, structure or function of the translational apparatus. Several vertebrate snoRNA host genes do not appear to code for functional proteins. We have identified two unusually compact box C/D multi-snoRNA host genes in D. melanogaster, dUHG1 and dUHG2, similar in their organization to the corresponding vertebrate non-protein-coding host genes. In dUHG1 and dUHG2, the snoRNA sequences are located within introns at a conserved distance of about 75 nucleotides upstream of the 3' splice sites. Both genes initiate transcription with TOP-like sequences that share unique features with previously reported Drosophila snoRNA host genes. Although the spliced dUHG RNAs are relatively stable, they exhibit little potential for protein coding.",2001,"K T Tycowski, J A Steitz, K T Tycowski, J A Steitz"

Northern blot analyses using a CYP9E2 or CYP4C21 probe showed that 'CYP9E2' and 'CYP4C21' were expressed at all life stages. Two pseudogenes related to CYP9E2 and three pseudogenes related to CYP4C21 were also isolated. These represent the first P450 pseudogenes from an insect other than Drosophila melanogaster.

Interactions of the Tribolium Sex combs reduced and proboscipedia orthologs in embryonic labial development,11779803,,"The role of Hox genes in the development of insect gnathal appendages has been examined in three insects: the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster; the milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus; and the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. In each of these organisms, the identity of the labium depends on the homeotic genes Sex combs reduced (Scr) and proboscipedia (pb). Loss of pb function in each of the three insects results in homeotic transformation of the labial appendages to legs. In contrast, loss of Scr function yields a different transformation in each species. Interestingly, mutations in Cephalothorax (Cx), the Tribolium ortholog of Scr, transform the labial appendages to antennae, a result seen in the other insects only when both pb and Scr are removed. We show here that the Tribolium labial appendages also develop as antennae in double mutants. Further, we demonstrate that expression of the Tribolium proboscipedia ortholog maxillopedia (mxp) is greatly reduced or absent in the labium of Cx mutant larvae. Thus, in the wild-type labial segment, Cx function is required (directly or indirectly) for mxp transcription. A similar interaction between Scr and pb during Drosophila embryogenesis has been described recently. Thus, this regulatory paradigm appears to be conserved at least within the Holometabola.",2001,"M A DeCamillis, D L Lewis, S J Brown, R W Beeman, R E Denell, M A DeCamillis, D L Lewis, S J Brown, R W Beeman, R E Denell"
Genetic and molecular characterization of a variegating hsp70-acZ fusion gene in the euchromatic 31 B region of Drosophila melanogaster,11550907,10.1139/g01-038,"A hsp70-lacZ fusion gene introduced into Drosophila melanogaster at the euchromatic 31B region by Pelement transformation displayed a variegated expression with respect to the lacZ fusion protein in the salivary gland cells under heat-shock conditions. The variegation is also reflected by the chromosome puffing pattern. Subsequent transposition of the 31B P element to other euchromatic positions restored wild-type activity, that is, a nonvariegated phenotype. A lower developmental temperature reduced the amount of expression under heat-shock conditions, similar to genes undergoing position-effect variegation (PEV). However, other modifiers of PEV did not affect the expression pattern of the gene.

[Stability in development and variability in morphological signs in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster: seasonal dynamics in 1999],11234427,,Seasonal dynamics of developmental stability and variability of morphological traits was examined in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster in order to compare these two parameters as indicators of temperature stress. Morphometric (thorax length and wing length) and meristic (number of sternopelural and orbital bristles) were studied. Variability was measured as the coefficient of variation. Stability of development was estimated as fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of bilateral traits. Thorax length and wing length did not exhibit consistent seasonal trends whereas wing loading significantly decreased. Significant seasonal changes in FA were not detected in any trait examined. Two traits showed reduced variation in autumn. The use of FA as an indicator of ecological stresses in insects is discussed on the basis of these results and the literature evidence.,2001,"M I Antipin, T A Rakitskaia, A G Imasheva, M I Antipin, T A Rakitskaia, A G Imasheva"

Subsequent PCR and Southern analysis revealed that gypsy elements had penetrated into the D. hydei cells, suggesting interspecific transmission of the retrovirus. A D. hydei cell line containing gypsy sequences was established and grown in a mixed culture together with the G418-resistant D. hydei cell line DH33, and gypsy was shown to be transmitted from cell to cell. The proportion of cells carrying gypsy increased with time. The rate of gypsy invasion of the lines DH14 and DH33 was 10(-3) and 10(-2) per cell per generation, respectively.

Our goals were to estimate the importance of these factors and to test the beneficial acclimation hypothesis. We measured speed of flies from two populations (the Congo and France) that developed at different temperatures (18, 25, and 29 degrees C) and were tested at different temperatures (18, 25, and 29 degrees C) and ages (2, 7, 13 days). Not surprisingly, speed increased strongly with test temperature. Speed was generally greatest for flies reared at an intermediate developmental temperature, contrary to the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, which predicts that speed would be greatest when influenced by interactions involving population. For example, speed was greatest for flies from France that developed at a low temperature, but for flies from the Congo that developed at a high temperature. The impact of developmental temperature declined with age. Surprisingly, speed actually increased with age for flies raised and maintained at a low temperature, but decreased with age for flies raised and maintained at an intermediate or at a high temperature. Thus, walking performance is highly dynamic phenotypically, complicating potential attempts to predict responses to selection on performance.",2001,"P Gibert, R B Huey, G W Gilchrist, P Gibert, R B Huey, G W Gilchrist"
"From first base: the sequence of the tip of the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster, a comparison of two sequencing strategies",11337470,10.1101/gr.173801,"We present the sequence of a contiguous 2.63 Mb of DNA extending from the tip of the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster.

We show that an interval between bands 3A2 and 3C2, believed in the 1970s to show a correlation between the number of bands on the polytene chromosomes and the 20 genes identified by conventional genetics, is predicted to contain 45 genes from its DNA sequence. We have determined the insertion sites of P-elements from 111 mutant lines, about half of which are in a position likely to affect the expression of novel predicted genes, thus representing a resource for subsequent functional genomic analysis. We compare the European Drosophila Genome Project sequence with the corresponding part of the independently assembled and annotated Joint Sequence determined through ""shotgun"" sequencing. Discounting differences in the distribution of known transposable elements between the strains sequenced in the two projects, we detected three major sequence differences, two of which are probably explained by errors in assembly; the origin of the third major difference is unclear. In addition there are eight sequence gaps within the Joint Sequence. At least six of these eight gaps are likely to be sites of transposable elements; the other two are complex.

The Rac GTPase-activating protein RotundRacGAP interferes with Drac1 and Dcdc42 signalling in Drosophila melanogaster,11468292,10.1074/jbc.M105779200,"RhoGTPases are negatively regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Here we demonstrate that Drosophila RotundRacGAP is active in vitro on Drac1 and Dcdc42 but not Drho1. Similarly, in yeast, RotundRacGAP interacts specifically with Drac1 and Dcdc42, as well as with their activated V12 forms, showing a particularly strong interaction with Dcdc42V12. In the fly, lowering RotundRacGAP dosage specifically modifies eye defects induced by expressing Drac1 or Dcdc42 but not Drho1, confirming that Drac1 and Dcdc42 are indeed in vivo targets of RotundRacGAP. Furthermore, embryonic-directed expression of either RotundRacGAP, or dominant negative Drac1N17, transgenes induces similar defects in dorsal closure and inhibits Drac1-dependent cytoskeleton assembly at the leading edge. Expression of truncated forms of RotundRacGAP shows that the GAP domain of RotundRacGAP is essential for its function. Unexpectedly, transgenes encoding Drac1N17, Dcdc42N17, or RotundRacGAP do not affect the c-Jun N-terminal kinase-dependent gene expression of decapentaplegic and puckered, indicating that another Drac1-independent signal redundantly activates this pathway. Finally, in a situation where Drac1 is constitutively activated, RotundRacGAP greatly reduces the ectopic expression of decapentaplegic, possibly by negatively regulating Dcdc42.",2001,"K Raymond, E Bergeret, M C Dagher, R Breton, R Griffin-Shea, M O Fauvarque, K Raymond, E Bergeret, M C Dagher, R Breton, R Griffin-Shea, M O Fauvarque"

Drosophila heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)/origin recognition complex (ORC) protein is associated with HP1 and ORC and functions in heterochromatin-induced silencing,11408576,10.1091/mbc.12.6.1671,"Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is a conserved component of the highly compact chromatin of higher eukaryotic centromeres and telomeres. Cytogenetic experiments in Drosophila have shown that HP1 localization into this chromatin is perturbed in mutants for the origin recognition complex (ORC) 2 subunit. ORC has a multisubunit DNA-binding activity that binds origins of DNA replication where it is required for origin firing. The DNA-binding activity of ORC is also used in the recruitment of the Sir1 protein to silence nucleation sites flanking silent copies of the mating-type genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A fraction of HP1 in the maternally loaded cytoplasm of the early Drosophila embryo is associated with a multiprotein complex containing Drosophila melanogaster ORC subunits. This complex appears to be poised to function in heterochromatin assembly later in embryonic development. Here we report the identification of a novel component of this complex, the HP1/ORC-associated protein. This protein contains similarity to DNA sequence-specific HMG proteins and is shown to bind specific satellite sequences and the telomere-associated sequence in vitro. The protein is shown to have heterochromatic localization in both diploid interphase and mitotic chromosomes and polytene chromosomes.

Molecular plasticity and functional enhancements of leg muscles in response to hypergravity in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,28978639,10.1242/jeb.160523,"Studies of organismal and tissue biomechanics have clearly demonstrated that musculoskeletal design is strongly dependent on experienced loads, which can vary in the short term, as a result of growth during life history and during the evolution of animal body size. However, how animals actually perceive and make adjustments to their load-bearing musculoskeletal elements that accommodate variation in their body weight is poorly understood. We developed an experimental model system that can be used to start addressing these open questions, and uses hypergravity centrifugation to experimentally manipulate the loads experienced by Drosophila melanogaster We examined effects of this manipulation on leg muscle alternative splicing of the sarcomere gene troponin T (Dmel\up; Fbgn0004169, herein referred to by its synonym TnT), a process that was previously demonstrated to precisely correlate with quantitative variation in body weight in Lepidoptera and rat. In a similar fashion, hypergravity centrifugation caused fast (i.e. within 24 h) changes to fly leg muscle TnT alternative splicing that correlated with body weight variation across eight D. melanogaster lines. Hypergravity treatment also appeared to enhance leg muscle function, as centrifuged flies showed an increased negative geotaxis response and jump ability. Although the identity and location of the sensors and effectors involved remains unknown, our results provide further support for the existence of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that translates signals that encode body weight into appropriate skeletal muscle molecular and functional responses.",2017,"Rudolf J Schilder, Megan Raynor, Rudolf J Schilder, Megan Raynor"

Inhalation toxicity of indoor air pollutants in Drosophila melanogaster using integrated transcriptomics and computational behavior analyses,28621308,10.1038/srep46473,"We conducted an inhalation toxicity test on the alternative animal model, Drosophila melanogaster, to investigate potential hazards of indoor air pollution. The inhalation toxicity of toluene and formaldehyde was investigated using comprehensive transcriptomics and computational behavior analyses. The ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) based on microarray data suggests the involvement of pathways related to immune response, stress response, and metabolism in formaldehyde and toluene exposure based on hub molecules. We conducted a toxicity test using mutants of the representative genes in these pathways to explore the toxicological consequences of alterations of these pathways. Furthermore, extensive computational behavior analysis showed that exposure to either toluene or formaldehyde reduced most of the behavioral parameters of both wild-type and mutants. Interestingly, behavioral alteration caused by toluene or formaldehyde exposure was most severe in the p38b mutant, suggesting that the defects in the p38 pathway underlie behavioral alteration. Overall, the results indicate that exposure to toluene and formaldehyde via inhalation causes severe toxicity in Drosophila, by inducing significant alterations in gene expression and behavior, suggesting that Drosophila can be used as a potential alternative model in inhalation toxicity screening.",2017,"Hyun-Jeong Eom, Yuedan Liu, Gyu-Suk Kwak, Muyoung Heo, Kyung Seuk Song, Yun Doo Chung, Tae-Soo Chon, Jinhee Choi, Hyun-Jeong Eom, Yuedan Liu, Gyu-Suk Kwak, Muyoung Heo, Kyung Seuk Song, Yun Doo Chung, Tae-Soo Chon, Jinhee Choi"
Relish2 mediates bursicon homodimer-induced prophylactic immunity in the mosquito Aedes aegypti,28225068,10.1038/srep43163,"Bursicon is a neuropeptide hormone consisting of two cystine-knot proteins (burs Î± and burs Î²), responsible for cuticle tanning and other developmental processes in insects. Recent studies show that each bursicon subunit forms homodimers that induce prophylactic immunity in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that bursicon homodimers act in prophylactic immunity in insects, and possibly arthropods, generally, using the mosquito, Aedes aegypti. We found that burs Î± and burs Î² are expressed in larvae, pupae and newly emerged adults. Treating newly emerged Ae. aegypti and D. melanogaster adults with recombinant bursicon (r-bursicon) heterodimer led to cuticle tanning in both species. Treating larvae and adults with r-bursicon homodimers led to up-regulation of five anti-microbial peptide (AMP) genes, noting the possibility that bursicon heterodimers also lead to up-regulation of these genes can not been excluded. The induced AMPs effectively suppressed the growth of bacteria in vitro. RNAi knock-down of the transcriptional factor Relish2 abolished the influence of r-bursicon homodimers on AMP production. We infer the bursicon homodimers induce expression of AMP genes via Relish2 in Ae. aegypti, as prophylactic immunity to protect mosquitoes during the vulnerable stages of each molt.",2017,"Hongwei Zhang, Shengzhang Dong, Xi Chen, David Stanley, Brenda Beerntsen, Qili Feng, Qisheng Song, Hongwei Zhang, Shengzhang Dong, Xi Chen, David Stanley, Brenda Beerntsen, Qili Feng, Qisheng Song"
Sex and Genetic Background Influence Superoxide Dismutase (cSOD)-Related Phenotypic Variation in Drosophila melanogaster,28624774,10.1534/g3.117.043836,"Mutations often have drastically different effects in different genetic backgrounds; understanding a gene's biological function then requires an understanding of its interaction with genetic diversity. The antioxidant enzyme cytosolic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (cSOD) catalyzes the dismutation of the superoxide radical, a molecule that can induce oxidative stress if its concentration exceeds cellular control. Accordingly, Drosophila melanogaster lacking functional cSOD exhibit a suite of phenotypes including decreased longevity, hypersensitivity to oxidative stress, impaired locomotion, and reduced NADP(H) enzyme activity in males. To date, cSOD-null phenotypes have primarily been characterized using males carrying one allele, cSodn108red, in a single genetic background. We used ANOVA, and the effect size partial eta squared, to partition the amount of variation attributable to cSOD activity, sex, and genetic background across a series of life history, locomotor, and biochemical phenotypes associated with the cSOD-null condition. Overall, the results demonstrate that the cSOD-null syndrome is largely consistent across sex and genetic background, but also significantly influenced by both. The sex-specific effects are particularly striking and our results support the idea that phenotypes cannot be considered to be fully defined if they are examined in limited genetic contexts.",2017,"Courtney E Lessel, Tony L Parkes, Joel Dickinson, Thomas J S Merritt, Courtney E Lessel, Tony L Parkes, Joel Dickinson, Thomas J S Merritt"

Toxicity assessment of sodium fluoride in Drosophila melanogaster after chronic sub-lethal exposure,27700992,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.09.112,"Sodium fluoride (NaF), one of the most frequently used fluoride compound is composed of Na+ and F-. Apart from its use in water fluoridation, NaF also acts as a major component for different dental products like toothpastes, gels and mouth rinses etc. The present study was carried out to explore the toxic impact of chronic NaF exposure on a non-target organism, Drosophila melanogaster. The larvae exposed to different concentrations of NaF through food showed a significant increase in HSP70 expression both qualitatively and quantitatively. The altered tail length and tail intensity in Comet assay validate the increased DNA damage in treated larvae. The activity of AChE, oxidative stress marker enzymes, phase I and phase II detoxifying enzymes were found to be significantly inhibited in the treated larvae when compared to control though there was no evidence of dose dependent change in each case. The alterations in the mentioned parameters can be due to increased body Fluoride ion (F-) concentration since the analysis with ion electrode analyzer revealed that F- concentration increased significantly with NaF treatment. Hence, the results suggest that D. melanogaster manifest prominent toxic response when subjected to chronic exposure to sub-lethal NaF concentrations.",2017,"Moumita Dutta, Prem Rajak, Salma Khatun, Sumedha Roy, Moumita Dutta, Prem Rajak, Salma Khatun, Sumedha Roy"
"Human TTBK1, TTBK2 and MARK1 kinase toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster is exacerbated by co-expression of human Tau",28711868,10.1242/bio.022749,"Tau protein is involved in numerous human neurodegenerative diseases, and Tau hyper-phosphorylation has been linked to Tau aggregation and toxicity. Previous studies have addressed toxicity and phospho-biology of human Tau (hTau) in Drosophila melanogaster However, hTau transgenes have most often been randomly inserted in the genome, thus making it difficult to compare between different hTau isoforms and phospho-mutants. In addition, many studies have expressed hTau also in mitotic cells, causing non-physiological toxic effects. Here, we overcome these confounds by integrating UAS-hTau isoform transgenes into specific genomic loci, and express hTau post-mitotically in the Drosophila nervous system. Lifespan and locomotor analyses show that all six of the hTau isoforms elicit similar toxicity in flies, although hTau2N3R showed somewhat elevated toxicity. To determine if Tau phosphorylation is responsible for toxicity, we analyzed the effects of co-expressing hTau isoforms together with Tau-kinases, focusing on TTBK1, TTBK2 and MARK1. We observed toxicity when expressing each of the three kinases alone, or in combination. Kinase toxicity was enhanced by hTau co-expression, with strongest co-toxicity for TTBK1. Mutagenesis and phosphorylation analysis indicates that hTau-MARK1 combinatorial toxicity may be due to direct phosphorylation of hTau, while hTau-TTBK1/2 combinatorial toxicity may result from independent toxicity mechanisms.",2017,"Josefin Fernius, Annika Starkenberg, Malgorzata Pokrzywa, Stefan Thor, Josefin Fernius, Annika Starkenberg, Malgorzata Pokrzywa, Stefan Thor"
Modeling of axonal endoplasmic reticulum network by spastic paraplegia proteins,28742022,10.7554/eLife.23882,"Axons contain a smooth tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network that is thought to be continuous with ER throughout the neuron; the mechanisms that form this axonal network are unknown. Mutations affecting reticulon or REEP proteins, with intramembrane hairpin domains that model ER membranes, cause an axon degenerative disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). We show that Drosophila axons have a dynamic axonal ER network, which these proteins help to model. Loss of HSP hairpin proteins causes ER sheet expansion, partial loss of ER from distal motor axons, and occasional discontinuities in axonal ER. Ultrastructural analysis reveals an extensive ER network in axons, which shows larger and fewer tubules in larvae that lack reticulon and REEP proteins, consistent with loss of membrane curvature. Therefore HSP hairpin-containing proteins are required for shaping and continuity of axonal ER, thus suggesting roles for ER modeling in axon maintenance and function.",2017,"Belgin YalÃ§Ä±n, Lu Zhao, Martin Stofanko, Niamh C O'Sullivan, Zi Han Kang, Annika Roost, Matthew R Thomas, Sophie Zaessinger, Olivier Blard, Alex L Patto, Anood Sohail, Valentina Baena, Mark Terasaki, Cahir J O'Kane, Belgin YalÃ§Ä±n, Lu Zhao, Martin Stofanko, Niamh C O'Sullivan, Zi Han Kang, Annika Roost, Matthew R Thomas, Sophie Zaessinger, Olivier Blard, Alex L Patto, Anood Sohail, Valentina Baena, Mark Terasaki, Cahir J O'Kane"
Animal Models to Study MicroRNA Function,28882225,10.1016/bs.acr.2017.06.006,"The discovery of the microRNAs, lin-4 and let-7 as critical mediators of normal development in Caenorhabditis elegans and their conservation throughout evolution has spearheaded research toward identifying novel roles of microRNAs in other cellular processes. To accurately elucidate these fundamental functions, especially in the context of an intact organism, various microRNA transgenic models have been generated and evaluated. Transgenic C. elegans (worms), Drosophila melanogaster (flies), Danio rerio (zebrafish), and Mus musculus (mouse) have contributed immensely toward uncovering the roles of multiple microRNAs in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, pathways that are severely altered in human diseases such as cancer. The simple model organisms, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and D. rerio, do not develop cancers but have proved to be convenient systesm in microRNA research, especially in characterizing the microRNA biogenesis machinery which is often dysregulated during human tumorigenesis. The microRNA-dependent events delineated via these simple in vivo systems have been further verified in vitro, and in more complex models of cancers, such as M. musculus. The focus of this review is to provide an overview of the important contributions made in the microRNA field using model organisms. The simple model systems provided the basis for the importance of microRNAs in normal cellular physiology, while the more complex animal systems provided evidence for the role of microRNAs dysregulation in cancers. Highlights include an overview of the various strategies used to generate transgenic organisms and a review of the use of transgenic mice for evaluating preclinical efficacy of microRNA-based cancer therapeutics.",2017,"Arpita S Pal, Andrea L Kasinski, Arpita S Pal, Andrea L Kasinski"
Reactive oxygen species-dependent Toll/NF-ÎºB activation in the Drosophila hematopoietic niche confers resistance to wasp parasitism,29091025,10.7554/eLife.25496,"Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in the adult mammalian bone marrow ensure blood cell renewal. Their cellular microenvironment, called 'niche', regulates hematopoiesis both under homeostatic and immune stress conditions. In the Drosophila hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, the posterior signaling center (PSC) acts as a niche to regulate the hematopoietic response to immune stress such as wasp parasitism. This response relies on the differentiation of lamellocytes, a cryptic cell type, dedicated to pathogen encapsulation and killing. Here, we establish that Toll/NF-ÎºB pathway activation in the PSC in response to wasp parasitism non-cell autonomously induces the lymph gland immune response. Our data further establish a regulatory network where co-activation of Toll/NF-ÎºB and EGFR signaling by ROS levels in the PSC/niche controls lymph gland hematopoiesis under parasitism.

Characterization of dFOXO binding sites upstream of the Insulin Receptor P2 promoter across the Drosophila phylogeny,29200426,10.1371/journal.pone.0188357,"The insulin/TOR signal transduction pathway plays a critical role in determining such important traits as body and organ size, metabolic homeostasis and life span. Although this pathway is highly conserved across the animal kingdom, the affected traits can exhibit important differences even between closely related species. Evolutionary studies of regulatory regions require the reliable identification of transcription factor binding sites. Here we have focused on the Insulin Receptor (InR) expression from its P2 promoter in the Drosophila genus, which in D. melanogaster is up-regulated by hypophosphorylated Drosophila FOXO (dFOXO). We have finely characterized this transcription factor binding sites in vitro along the 1.3 kb region upstream of the InR P2 promoter in five Drosophila species. Moreover, we have tested the effect of mutations in the characterized dFOXO sites of D. melanogaster in transgenic flies. The number of experimentally established binding sites varies across the 1.3 kb region of any particular species, and their distribution also differs among species. In D. melanogaster, InR expression from P2 is differentially affected by dFOXO binding sites at the proximal and distal halves of the species 1.3 kb fragment.

A Distinctive and Host-Restricted Gut Microbiota in Populations of a Cactophilic Drosophila Species,28939605,10.1128/AEM.01551-17,"Almost all animals possess gut microbial communities, but the nature of these communities varies immensely. For example, in social bees and mammals, the composition is relatively constant within species and is dominated by specialist bacteria that do not live elsewhere; in laboratory studies and field surveys of Drosophila melanogaster, however, gut communities consist of bacteria that are ingested with food and that vary widely among individuals and localities. We addressed whether an ecological specialist in its natural habitat has a microbiota dominated by gut specialists or by environmental bacteria. Drosophila nigrospiracula is a species that is endemic to the Sonoran Desert and is restricted to decaying tissues of two giant columnar cacti, Pachycereus pringlei (cardÃ³n cactus) and Carnegiea gigantea (saguaro cactus). We found that the D. nigrospiracula microbiota differs strikingly from that of the cactus tissue on which the flies feed. The most abundant bacteria in the flies are rare or completely absent in the cactus tissue and are consistently abundant in flies from different cacti and localities. Several of these fly-associated bacterial groups, such as the bacterial order Orbales and the genera Serpens and Dysgonomonas, have been identified in prior surveys of insects from the orders Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera, including several Drosophila species. Although the functions of these bacterial groups are mostly unexplored, Orbales species studied in bees are known to break down plant polysaccharides and use the resulting sugars. Thus, these bacterial groups appear to be specialized to the insect gut environment, where they may colonize through direct host-to-host transmission in natural settings.IMPORTANCE Flies in the genus Drosophila have become laboratory models for microbiota research, yet the bacteria commonly used in these experiments are rarely found in wild-caught flies and instead represent bacteria also present in the food. This study shows that an ecologically specialized Drosophila species possesses a distinctive microbiome, composed of bacterial types absent from the flies' natural food but widespread in other wild-caught insects.

The Drosophila dorsal morphogen represses the tolloid gene by interacting with a silencer element,8264640,10.1128/mcb.14.1.713,"The dorsal protein (DL) regulates the transcriptional activity of several genes that determine cell fate along the dorsoventral axis of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo. DL is present at high levels in ventral nuclei, where it activates some genes (twi and sna) and represses others (zen, dpp, and tld). DL shows homology to the Rel family of proteins and interacts with specific DNA sequences in the regulatory regions of its target genes. The distal portion of the zen gene acts as a silencer that can mediate the repression of a heterologous promoter in ventral regions of the embryo. It contains four DL binding sites which alone are sufficient for activation but not repression. Here we analyze the interaction of DL with another one of its repressed targets, the tolloid (tld) gene. Approximately 800 bp of 5'-flanking sequences upstream of the tld coding region were shown to drive an expression pattern indistinguishable from the wild-type pattern. A 423-bp fragment located within these sequences contains two DL binding sites and was shown to act as a silencer to mediate ventral repression. Point mutations in the sites abolish not only DNA binding but also ventral repression.

"Enhancer of rudimentaryp1, e(r)p1, a highly conserved enhancer of the rudimentary gene",7896098,,"A hybrid dysgenesis-induced mutation, enhancer of rudimentaryp1 (e(r)p1), is a recessive enhancer of a weak rudimentary mutant phenotype in Drosophila melanogaster. The e(r) gene was cloned using P element tagging and localized to region 8B on the X chromosome. It encodes a 1.0-kb and a 1.2-kb transcript. The 1.0-kb transcript is present in both adult males and females, while the 1.2-kb transcript is predominantly found in females. The difference in the lengths of the two e(r) transcripts is caused by two different polyadenylation sites spaced 228 bp apart. The amounts of both of these transcripts are drastically reduced in the e(r)p1 mutant. The P element in e(r)p1 is inserted in the 5'-untranslated leader region near the start of transcription. It may be producing its effect by suppressing transcription and/or by providing transcription termination and polyadenylation signals. The putative e(r) protein is 104 amino acids in length and bears no striking resemblance to protein sequences in GenBank or PIR. While its biochemical function is unknown at this time, sequence analysis indicates that the e(r) protein is highly conserved and, presumably, functionally very important.

Phenotypic rescue by a bovine transgene in a Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-null mutant of Drosophila melanogaster,8289809,10.1128/mcb.14.2.1302,"Null mutants for Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) in Drosophila melanogaster are male sterile, have a greatly reduced adult life span, and are hypersensitive to paraquat. We have introduced a synthetic bovine CuZnSOD transgene under the transcriptional control of the D. melanogaster 5C actin promoter into a CuZnSOD-null mutant of D. melanogaster. This was carried out by P-element-mediated transformation of the Drosophila-bovine CuZnSOD transgene into a CuZnSOD+ recipient strain followed by genetic crossing of the transgene into a strain carrying the CuZnSOD-null mutation, cSODn108. The resulting transformants express bovine CuZnSOD exclusively to about 30% of normal Drosophila CuZnSOD levels. Expression of the Drosophila-bovine CuZnSOD transgene in the CuZnSOD-null mutant rescues male fertility and resistance to paraquat to apparently normal levels. However, adult life span is restored to only 30% of normal, and resistance to hyperoxia is 90% of that found in control flies. This striking differential restoration of pleiotropic phenotypes could be the result of a threshhold of CuZnSOD expression necessary for normal male fertility and resistance to the toxicity of paraquat or hyperoxia which is lower than the threshold required to sustain a normal adult life span. Alternatively, the differential rescue of fertility, resistance to active oxygen, and life span might indicate different cell-specific transcriptional requirements for these functions which are normally provided by the control elements of the native CuZnSOD gene but are only partly compensated for by the transcriptional control elements of the actin 5C promoter.",1994,"I Reveillaud, J Phillips, B Duyf, A Hilliker, A Kongpachith, J E Fleming"

USING HITCHHIKING GENES TO STUDY ADAPTATION AND DIVERGENCE DURING SPECIATION WITHIN THE DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER SPECIES COMPLEX,28565154,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1994.tb02222.x,"Several studies of intraspecific and interspecific DNA sequence variation from Drosophila loci have revealed a pattern of low intraspecific variation from genomic regions of low recombination. The mechanisms consistently invoked to explain these patterns are the selective sweep of advantageous mutations together with genetic hitchhiking of linked loci. To examine the effect of selective sweeps on genetic divergence during speciation, we studied two loci in different genomic regions thought to be subject to selective sweeps. We obtained DNA sequences from 1.1kb pair portions of the fourth chromosome locus cubitus interruptus Dominant (ciD ) and from the asense locus near the telomere of the X chromosome. At ciD , we found very low variation among multiple lines of Drosophila mauritiana and D. sechellia. This finding is consistent with an earlier report of very low variation in D. melanogaster and D. simulans at ciD and supports the conclusion of selective sweeps and genetic hitchhiking on the nonrecombining fourth chromosome. The pattern of variation found at asense suggests that a selective sweep has occurred recently at the tip of the X chromosome in D. simulans, but not in D. melanogaster or D. mauritiana. The data from ciD and asense are compared with data from three X chromosome loci (period, zeste, and yolk protein 2) that experience normal levels of recombination. By examining estimated genealogies and the rates at which different classes of mutations have accumulated, we conclude that selective sweeps are common occurrences on the fourth chromosome but less common near the tip of the X chromosome. An interesting pattern of low variation at ciD among D. simulans, D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia suggests that a selective sweep may have occurred among these forms even after divergence into separate species had begun.",1994,"Holly Hilton, Richard M Kliman, Jody Hey, Holly Hilton, Richard M Kliman, Jody Hey"
Metabolism of ecdysone and 20-hydroxyecdysone in adult Drosophila melanogaster,8111423,10.1016/0965-1748(94)90122-8,"The metabolism of [3H]ecdysone injected into adult female and male Drosophila melanogaster was investigated. The metabolites present in flies and faeces were analysed separately after incubation times of 1, 2 or 4 h. In female flies ecdysone-22-fatty acid acyl esters were the major metabolites followed by 3-dehydroecdysone, 26-hydroxyecdysone, ecdysonoic acid, 20-hydroxyecdysone and a negatively charged conjugate of ecdysone. In male flies the same compounds were formed, but their relative concentrations were somewhat different from those in female flies. All metabolites formed can be excreted. [3H]20-hydroxyecdysone was metabolized in much the same way: 20-hydroxyecdysone-22-acyl esters, 3-dehydro-20-hydroxyecdysone, 20-hydroxy-ecdysonoic acid and a negatively charged conjugate of 20-hydroxyecdysone were formed.

The Drosophila melanogaster homolog of ribosomal protein S18,8163194,10.1016/0378-1119(94)90577-0,"The sequence of the cDNA encoding the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of the human and rat small-subunit ribosomal protein, S18 (rpS18), is presented. The deduced 152-amino-acid (aa) sequence exhibits 76% identity to that of the human and rat rpS18 (152 aa), and is, like them, a member of the larger rpS13 family which includes archaebacterial, eubacterial and plant mitochondrial (mt) rpS13. The D. melanogaster rpS18 gene is single copy and maps at 56F, a chromosome region encompassing a previously characterised Minute locus, M(2)56F. The rpS18 gene gives rise to a single 700-nucleotide transcript present throughout development. A comparison of the rpS13 family members suggests that conservation is greatest at the N- and C-termini, whilst additional insertions are present in the Drosophila, mammalian and archaebacterial proteins relative to the eubacterial and plant mt proteins.",1994,"J Garwood, J A Lepesant"
Comparisons of eukaryotic genomic sequences,7809130,10.1073/pnas.91.26.12832,"A method for assessing genomic similarity based on relative abundances of short oligonucleotides in large DNA samples is introduced. The method requires neither homologous sequences nor prior sequence alignments. The analysis centers on (i) dinucleotide (and tri- and tetra-) relative abundance extremes in genomic sequences, (ii) distances between sequences based on all dinucleotide relative abundance values, and (iii) a multidimensional partial ordering protocol. The emphasis in this paper is on assessments of general relatedness of genomes as distinguished from phylogenetic reconstructions. Our methods demonstrate that the relative abundance distances almost always differ more for genomic interspecific sequence comparisons than for genomic intraspecific sequence comparisons, indicating congruence over different genome sequence samples. The genomic comparisons are generally concordant with accepted phylogenies among vertebrate and among fungal species sequences. Several unexpected relationships between the major groups of metazoa, fungal, and protist DNA emerge, including the following. (i) Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in dinucleotide relative abundance distances are as similar to each other as human is to bovine. (ii) S. cerevisiae, although substantially far from, is significantly closer to the vertebrates than are the invertebrates (Drosophila melanogaster, Bombyx mori, and Caenorhabditis elegans). This phenomenon may suggest variable evolutionary rates during the metazoan radiations and slower changes in the fungal divergences, and/or a polyphyletic origin of metazoa. (iii) The genomic sequences of D. melanogaster and Trypanosoma brucei are strikingly similar. This DNA similarity might be explained by some molecular adaptation of the parasite to its dipteran (tsetse fly) host, a host-parasite gene transfer hypothesis. Robustness of the methods may be due to a genomic signature of dinucleotide relative abundance values reflecting DNA structures related to dinucleotide stacking energies, constraints of DNA curvature, and mechanisms attendant to replication, repair, and recombination.",1994,"S Karlin, I Ladunga, S Karlin, I Ladunga"
The bipartite D. melanogaster twist promoter is reorganized in D. virilis,8068548,10.1016/0925-4773(94)90036-1,"The pivotal role of twist in mesoderm determination in the Drosophila embryo depends upon two processes--the transcriptional activation of twist in the ventrally located mesodermal anlage and the regulation of downstream gene expression by the twist transcription factor. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes, we have compared both the coding and regulatory regions of the twist genes from Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis. Within the coding region, the basic-helix-loop-helix DNA binding and dimerization motif is highly conserved, consistent with the functional importance of this domain. A comparison of the transcriptional regulatory regions reveals a high degree of conservation in the more distal of the two ventral activator regions that have been mapped in the twist 5' flanking region. On the other hand, the more proximal ventral activator region is absent at the corresponding position in the D. virilis twist gene. Instead, there is a region in the second intron of the D. virilis gene that resembles the proximal element of the D. melanogaster gene, in that it consists of little more than a series of whole and half binding sites for the dorsal morphogen. In transformation experiments, the intronic D. virilis element directs an expression pattern that is indistinguishable from that directed by the D. melanogaster proximal VAR. Thus, the twi genes from these two species appear to have evolved enhancer elements with very similar structural and functional properties. These findings suggest that apparently redundant spatially regulated enhancer elements may each play essential roles in fine tuning the level and/or pattern of gene expression.",1994,"D Pan, S A Valentine, A J Courey, D Pan, S A Valentine, A J Courey"
Redundant cis-acting elements control expression of the Drosophila affinidisjuncta Adh gene in the larval fat body,8165141,10.1093/nar/22.7.1257,"The alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene in the Hawaiian species of fruit fly, Drosophila affinidisjuncta, like the Adh genes from all Drosophila species analyzed, is expressed at high levels in the larval fat body via a larval-specific promoter. To identify the cis-acting elements involved in this highly conserved aspect of Adh gene expression, deleted D. affinidisjuncta genes were introduced into D. melanogaster by somatic transformation. Unlike previously described methods, this transformation system allows analysis of Adh gene expression specifically in the larval fat body. The arrangement of sequences influencing expression of the proximal promoter of this gene in the larval fat body differs markedly from that described for the Adh gene from the distant relative, D. melanogaster. Multiple redundant elements dispersed 5' and 3' to the gene, only some of which map to regions carrying evolutionarily conserved sequences, affect expression in the fat body. D. affinidisjuncta employs a novel mode of Adh gene regulation in which the proximal promoter is influenced by sequences having roles in expression of the distal promoter. This gene is also unique in that far upstream sequences can compensate for loss of sequences within 200 bp of the proximal RNA start site. Furthermore, expression is influenced in an unusual, context-dependent manner by a naturally-occurring 3' duplication of the proximal promoter--a feature found only in Hawaiian species.",1994,"R W McKenzie, J Hu, M D Brennan, R W McKenzie, J Hu, M D Brennan"
Genetic mechanisms of early neurogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,7833855,10.1016/0928-4257(94)90022-1,"The neuroectoderm of insects contains an initially indifferent population of cells which during later development will give rise to the progenitor cells of the neural and epidermal lineages. Experimental evidence indicates that cellular interactions determine which cells will adopt each one of these fates. The invoked cell interactions are assumed to be mediated by the products of several genes forming a complex, not yet well understood network of interrelationships. Elements of this network are the proteins encoded by Delta and Notch, which appear to convey the regulatory signals between the cells; the proteins encoded by the achaete-scute gene complex, which regulate neural development, and the proteins encoded by the Enhancer of split gene complex, which give neuroectodermal cells access to epidermal development.

"A genetic analysis of hermaphrodite, a pleiotropic sex determination gene in Drosophila melanogaster",8138157,,"Sex determination in Drosophila is controlled by a cascade of regulatory genes. Here we describe hermaphrodite (her), a new component of this regulatory cascade with pleiotropic zygotic and maternal functions. Zygotically, her+ function is required for female sexual differentiation: when zygotic her+ function is lacking, females are transformed to intersexes. Zygotic her+ function may also play a role in male sexual differentiation. Maternally, her+ function is needed to ensure the viability of female progeny: a partial loss of her+ function preferentially kills daughters. In addition, her has both zygotic and maternal functions required for viability in both sexes. Temperature sensitivity prevails for all known her alleles and for all of the her phenotypes described above, suggesting that her may participate in an intrinsically temperature-sensitive process. This analysis of four her alleles also indicates that the zygotic and maternal components of of her function are differentially mutable. We have localized her cytologically to 36A3-36A11.",1994,"M A Pultz, G S Carson, B S Baker, M A Pultz, G S Carson, B S Baker"

One mechanism of resistance is the alteration of acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7), the molecular target for organophosphates and carbamates. Here, we report the sequence analysis of the Ace gene in several resistant field strains of Drosophila melanogaster. This analysis resulted in the identification of five point mutations associated with reduced sensitivities to insecticides. In some cases, several of these mutations were found to be combined in the same protein, leading to different resistance patterns. Our results suggest that recombination between resistant alleles preexisting in natural populations is a mechanism by which insects rapidly adapt to new selective pressures.",1994,"A Mutero, M Pralavorio, J M Bride, D Fournier, A Mutero, M Pralavorio, J M Bride, D Fournier"
"Recovery of dominant, autosomal flightless mutants of Drosophila melanogaster and identification of a new gene required for normal muscle structure and function",8056306,,"To identify further mutations affecting muscle function and development in Drosophila melanogaster we recovered 22 autosomal dominant flightless mutations. From these we have isolated eight viable and lethal alleles of the muscle myosin heavy chain gene, and seven viable alleles of the indirect flight muscle (IFM)-specific Act88F actin gene. The Mhc mutations display a variety of phenotypic effects, ranging from reductions in myosin heavy chain content in the indirect flight muscles only, to reductions in the levels of this protein in other muscles. The Act88F mutations range from those which produce no stable actin and have severely abnormal myofibrillar structure, to those which accumulate apparently normal levels of actin in the flight muscles but which still have abnormal myofibrils and fly very poorly. We also recovered two recessive flightless mutants on the third chromosome. The remaining five dominant flightless mutations are all lethal alleles of a gene named lethal(3)Laker. The Laker alleles have been characterized and the gene located in polytene bands 62A10,B1-62B2,4. Laker is a previously unidentified locus which is haplo-insufficient for flight.

The cappuccino and spire loci are required for both posterior and dorsoventral patterning. Time-lapse confocal microscopic analyses of living egg chambers demonstrated that these mutations induce microtubule reorganization and the premature initiation of microtubule-dependent ooplasmic streaming. As a result, microtubule organization is altered and bulk ooplasm rapidly streams during the developmental stages in which morphogens are normally localized. These changes in oocyte cytoarchitecture and dynamics appear to disrupt axial patterning of the embryo.",1994,"W E Theurkauf, W E Theurkauf"

We used the addition experimental design (Mather & Caligari, 1981). No genotype-environment interaction was observed when comparing the reduction in thorax length of 'large' and 'control' lines with increasing larval density for any culture series, i.e. rank ordering of genotypes and additive genetic variances remained the same in all the environments tested. In contrast, the reduction in thorax length for the base stock as density increased was proportionally smaller than that of the 'large' and 'control' lines. Development time increased more rapidly with larval density in the 'large' lines than in the 'controls' or base stock. Sex ratio was unaffected by larval density but thorax length and the development time of females were more affected than those of males by increasing larval density. The estimate of total fitness showed clear evidence of gene-environment interaction for the effect of body size on fitness, with genetically large individuals at an increasing disadvantage with increasing larval density.",1994,"M Santos, K Fowler, L Partridge, M Santos, K Fowler, L Partridge"

The Drosophila homeotic mutation Nasobemia (AntpNs) and its revertants: an analysis of mutational reversion,7851768,,"The homeotic gene Antennapedia (Antp) controls determination of many different cell types in the thorax and abdomen of Drosophila melanogaster. The spontaneous mutant allele Nasobemia (AntpNs) and its revertants have been widely used to infer normal Antp gene function but have not themselves been thoroughly characterized. Our analysis reveals that AntpNs consists of an internal 25-kb partial duplication of the Antp gene as well as a complex insertion of > 40 kb of new DNA including two roo transposons. The duplication gives the mutant gene three Antp promoters, and transcripts from each of these are correctly processed to yield functional ANTP proteins. At least two of the promoters are ectopically active in the eye-antenna imaginal discs, leading to homeotic transformation of the adult head. A molecular and genetic description of several AntpNs revertants shows them to be diverse in structure and activity, including a restoration of the wild type, rearrangements separating two of the AntpNs promoters from the coding sequences, and protein nulls and hypomorphs affecting expression from all three of the promoters. Finally, one revertant has a suppressing lesion in the osa locus far away from Antp. These features explain the unusual homozygous viable nature of AntpNs, suggest a mechanism by which its homeotic transformation occurs, and exemplify the diversity of ways in which mutational reversion can take place.",1994,"P B Talbert, R L Garber, P B Talbert, R L Garber"

FaRPs and serotonin (5-HT) each affect the frequency of D. melanogaster heart contractions in vivo. We examined the cellular expression of FaRPs and 5-HT, and the activities of FMRFamide, SDNFMRFamide, PDNFMRFamide, or DMS and 5-HT on heart rate. FaRPs and 5-HT were not co-localized; FaRP-and 5-HT-immunoreactive fibers extended from different brain cells and innervated the anterior D. melanogaster dorsal vessel. However, no neuron expressed both a FaRP and 5-HT. The effect of FMRFamide and 5-HT was not different from the effect of 5-HT alone on heart rate. The effect of PDNFMRFamide and 5-HT showed an additive effect on heart rate. SDNFMRFamide and 5-HT or DMS and 5-HT resulted in non-additive effects on heart rate.

"Parcas, a regulator of non-receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, acts during anterior-posterior patterning and somatic muscle development in Drosophila melanogaster",16987509,10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.07.049,"We have isolated parcas (pcs) in a screen to identify novel regulators of muscle morphogenesis. Pcs is expressed in the ovary and oocyte during oogenesis and again in the embryo, specifically in the developing mesoderm, throughout muscle development. pcs is first required in the ovary during oogenesis for patterning and segmentation of the early Drosophila embryo due primarily to its role in the regulation of Oskar (Osk) levels. In addition to the general patterning defects observed in embryos lacking maternal contribution of pcs, these embryos show defects in Wingless (Wg) expression, causing losses of Wg-dependent cell types within the affected segment. pcs activity is required again later during embryogenesis in the developing mesoderm for muscle development. Loss and gain of function studies demonstrate that pcs is necessary at distinct times for muscle specification and morphogenesis. Pcs is predicted to be a novel regulator of non-receptor tyrosine kinase (NRTK) signaling. We have identified one target of Pcs regulation, the Drosophila Tec kinase Btk29A. While Btk29A appears to be regulated by Pcs during its early role in patterning and segmentation, it does not appear to be a major target of Pcs regulation during muscle development.

Programmed cell death mechanisms of identifiable peptidergic neurons in Drosophila melanogaster,16672345,10.1242/dev.02376,"The molecular basis of programmed cell death (PCD) of neurons during early metamorphic development of the central nervous system (CNS) in Drosophila melanogaster are largely unknown, in part owing to the lack of appropriate model systems. Here, we provide evidence showing that a group of neurons (vCrz) that express neuropeptide Corazonin (Crz) gene in the ventral nerve cord of the larval CNS undergo programmed death within 6 hours of the onset of metamorphosis. The death was prevented by targeted expression of caspase inhibitor p35, suggesting that these larval neurons are eliminated via a caspase-dependent pathway. Genetic and transgenic disruptions of ecdysone signal transduction involving ecdysone receptor-B (EcR-B) isoforms suppressed vCrz death, whereas transgenic re-introduction of either EcR-B1 or EcR-B2 isoform into the EcR-B-null mutant resumed normal death. Expression of reaper in vCrz neurons and suppression of vCrz-cell death in a reaper-null mutant suggest that reaper functions are required for the death, while no apparent role was found for hid or grim as a death promoter. Our data further suggest that diap1 does not play a role as a central regulator of the PCD of vCrz neurons. Significant delay of vCrz-cell death was observed in mutants that lack dronc or dark functions, indicating that formation of an apoptosome is necessary, but not sufficient, for timely execution of the death. These results suggest that activated ecdysone signaling determines precise developmental timing of the neuronal degeneration during early metamorphosis, and that subsequent reaper-mediated caspase activation occurs through a novel DIAP1-independent pathway.",2006,"Youn-Jeong Choi, Gyunghee Lee, Jae H Park, Youn-Jeong Choi, Gyunghee Lee, Jae H Park"
Cyanide binding and heme cavity conformational transitions in Drosophila melanogaster hexacoordinate hemoglobin,16906763,10.1021/bi060462a,"The reason for the presence of hemoglobin-like molecules in insects, such as Drosophila melanogaster, that live in fully aerobic environments has yet to be determined. Heme endogenous hexacoordination (where HisE7 and HisF8 axial ligands to the heme Fe atom are both provided by the protein) is a recently discovered mechanism proposed to modulate O(2) affinity in hemoglobins from different species. Previous results have shown that D. melanogaster hemoglobin 1 (product of the glob1 gene) displays heme endogenous hexacoordination in both the ferrous and ferric states. Here we present kinetic data characterizing the exogenous cyanide ligand binding process, and the three-dimensional structure (at 1.4 A resolution) of the ensuing cyano-met D. melanogaster hemoglobin. Comparison with the crystal structure of the endogenously hexacoordinated D. melanogaster hemoglobin shows that the transition to the cyano-met form is supported by conformational readjustment in the CD-D-E region of the protein, which removes HisE7 from the heme. The structural and functional features of D. melanogaster hemoglobin are examined in light of previous results achieved for human and mouse neuroglobins and for human cytoglobin, which display heme endogenous hexacoordination. The study shows that, despite the rather constant value for cyanide association rate constants for the ferric hemoproteins, different distal site conformational readjustments and/or heme sliding mechanisms are displayed by the known hexacoordinate hemoglobins as a result of exogenous ligand binding.",2006,"Daniele de Sanctis, Paolo Ascenzi, Alessio Bocedi, Sylvia Dewilde, Thorsten Burmester, Thomas Hankeln, Luc Moens, Martino Bolognesi"
Genome-wide identification of direct targets of the Drosophila retinal determination protein Eyeless,16533912,10.1101/gr.4673006,"The discovery of direct downstream targets of transcription factors (TFs) is necessary for understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying complex, highly regulated processes such as development. In this report, we have used a combinatorial strategy to conduct a genome-wide search for novel direct targets of Eyeless (Ey), a key transcription factor controlling early eye development in Drosophila. To overcome the lack of high-quality consensus binding site sequences, phylogenetic shadowing of known Ey binding sites in sine oculis (so) was used to construct a position weight matrix (PWM) of the Ey protein. This PWM was then used for in silico prediction of potential binding sites in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. To reduce the false positive rate, conservation of these potential binding sites was assessed by comparing the genomic sequences from seven Drosophila species. In parallel, microarray analysis of wild-type versus ectopic ey-expressing tissue, followed by microarray-based epistasis experiments in an atonal (ato) mutant background, identified 188 genes induced by ey. Intersection of in silico predicted conserved Ey binding sites with the candidate gene list produced through expression profiling yields a list of 20 putative ey-induced, eye-enriched, ato-independent, direct targets of Ey. The accuracy of this list of genes was confirmed using both in vitro and in vivo methods. Initial analysis reveals three genes, eyes absent, shifted, and Optix, as novel direct targets of Ey.

Intron length evolution in the 2 sister species has been different: in D. melanogaster, X-linked introns have increased slightly in size, whereas autosomal ones have decreased slightly in size; in D. simulans, both X-linked and autosomal introns have decreased in size. To understand the possible evolutionary causes of these lineage- and chromosome-specific patterns of intron evolution, I studied insertion-deletion (indel) polymorphism and divergence in D. melanogaster. Small insertion mutations segregate at elevated frequencies and enjoy elevated probabilities of fixation, particularly on the X chromosome. In contrast, there is no detectable X chromosome effect on fixations in D. simulans. These findings suggest X chromosome-specific selection or biased gene conversion-gap repair favoring insertions in D. melanogaster but not in D. simulans. These chromosome- and lineage-specific patterns of indel substitution are not easily explained by existing general population genetic models of intron length evolution.

A double-switch system regulates male courtship behavior in male and female Drosophila melanogaster,17086183,10.1038/ng1908,"Current models describe male-specific fruitless (fruM) as a genetic 'switch' regulating sexual behavior in Drosophila melanogaster, and they postulate that female (F) and male (M) doublesex (dsx) products control body sexual morphology. In contradiction to this simple model, we show that dsx, as well as fruM and non-sex-specific retained (retn), affect both male and female sexual behaviors. In females, both retn and dsxF contribute to female receptivity, and both genes act to repress male-like courtship activity in the presence or absence of fruM. In males, consistent with the opposing functions of dsxM and dsxF, dsxM acts as a positive factor for male courtship. retn also acts counter to fruM in the development of the male-specific muscle of Lawrence. Molecularly, retn seems to regulate sexual behavior via a previously described complex that represses zerknullt. Thus, we show that fru and dsx together act as a 'switch' system regulating behavior in the context of other developmental genes, such as retn.",2006,"Troy R Shirangi, Barbara J Taylor, Michael McKeown, Troy R Shirangi, Barbara J Taylor, Michael McKeown"

Expression of the UDP-GalNAc: polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase family is spatially and temporally regulated during Drosophila development,16251381,10.1093/glycob/cwj051,"The UDP-GalNAc : polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (ppGaNTase or ppGalNAcT or pgant) enzyme family is responsible for the first committed step in the synthesis of mucin-type O-glycans on protein substrates. Previous work from our group has demonstrated both sequence and functional conservation between members of this family in mammals and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. One member of this family in Drosophila has been shown to be essential for viability and development. In an effort to understand the developmental stages and processes in which O-glycosylation is involved, we have determined the expression pattern of each functional family member as well as putative isoforms during Drosophila development. Our studies indicate that isoforms are expressed in discrete spatial and temporal fashions during development, with some isoforms being found uniquely in restricted areas of the developing embryo (brain, trachea, pharynx, esophagus, proventriculus, and amnioserosa), whereas others are found in multiple regions and overlap with the expression of other isoforms (salivary glands, posterior midgut, anterior midgut, and the fore-/hindgut) during embryogenesis. Additionally, we examined expression patterns in imaginal discs from third instar larvae, which will become the adult structures. Most isoforms are also expressed in the imaginal discs, with some showing unique transcript localization and spatial regulatory control. Thus, this report provides insight into the specific regions during Drosophila development that may require O-linked glycosylation in vivo as well as which isoforms may act cooperatively in certain tissues and which may be uniquely responsible for glycosylation in others.",2006,"E Tian, Kelly G Ten Hagen, E Tian, Kelly G Ten Hagen"
Functional conservation of the fruitless male sex-determination gene across 250 Myr of insect evolution,16319090,10.1093/molbev/msj070,"Male sexual behavior in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is regulated by fruitless (fru), a sex-determination gene specifying the synthesis of BTB-Zn finger proteins that likely function as male-specific transcriptional regulators. Expression of fru in the nervous system specifies male sexual behavior and the muscle of Lawrence (MOL), an abdominal muscle that develops in males but not in females. We have isolated the fru ortholog from the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae and show the gene's conserved genomic structure. We demonstrate that male-specific mosquito fru protein isoforms arise by conserved mechanisms of sex-specifically activated and alternative exon splicing. A male-determining function of mosquito fru is revealed by ectopic expression of the male mosquito isoform FRUMC in fruit flies; this results in MOL development in both fru-mutant males and fru+ females who otherwise develop no MOL. In parallel, we provide evidence of a unique feature of muscle differentiation within the fifth abdominal segment of male mosquitoes that strongly resembles the fruit fly MOL. Given these conserved features within the context of 250 Myr of evolutionary divergence between Drosophila and Anopheles, we hypothesize that fru is the prototypic gene of male sexual behavior among dipteran insects.",2006,"Donald A Gailey, Jean-Christophe Billeter, Jim H Liu, Frederick Bauzon, Jane B Allendorfer, Stephen F Goodwin, Donald A Gailey, Jean-Christophe Billeter, Jim H Liu, Frederick Bauzon, Jane B Allendorfer, Stephen F Goodwin"

Wnt11 controls cell contact persistence by local accumulation of Frizzled 7 at the plasma membrane,17130287,10.1083/jcb.200606017,"Wnt11 is a key signal, determining cell polarization and migration during vertebrate gastrulation. It is known that Wnt11 functionally interacts with several signaling components, the homologues of which control planar cell polarity in Drosophila melanogaster. Although in D. melanogaster these components are thought to polarize cells by asymmetrically localizing at the plasma membrane, it is not yet clear whether their subcellular localization plays a similarly important role in vertebrates. We show that in zebrafish embryonic cells, Wnt11 locally functions at the plasma membrane by accumulating its receptor, Frizzled 7, on adjacent sites of cell contacts. Wnt11-induced Frizzled 7 accumulations recruit the intracellular Wnt signaling mediator Dishevelled, as well as Wnt11 itself, and locally increase cell contact persistence. This increase in cell contact persistence is mediated by the local interaction of Wnt11, Frizzled 7, and the atypical cadherin Flamingo at the plasma membrane, and it does not require the activity of further downstream effectors of Wnt11 signaling, such as RhoA and Rok2. We propose that Wnt11, by interacting with Frizzled 7 and Flamingo, modulates local cell contact persistence to coordinate cell movements during gastrulation.",2006,"Sabine Witzel, Vitaly Zimyanin, Filipa Carreira-Barbosa, Masazumi Tada, Carl-Philipp Heisenberg, Sabine Witzel, Vitaly Zimyanin, Filipa Carreira-Barbosa, Masazumi Tada, Carl-Philipp Heisenberg"

The genotoxic profile of two inhibitors of DNA topoisomerases were evaluated using an in vivo somatic w/w+ eye assay of Drosophila melanogaster for the detection of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) by homologous mitotic recombination, intra-chromosomal recombination and structural chromosomal aberrations. We studied camptothecin (CPT) as a topoisomerase-I-interactive agent and etoposide (ETOP) as a topoisomerase II inhibitor. These drugs act by stabilizing a ternary complex consisting of topoisomerases covalently linked to DNA at single-strand or at double-strand breaks, thereby preventing the relegation step of the breakage/rejoining reaction mediated by the enzyme. The genotoxic profiles were determined from the appearance of eye tissue in adult flies, in which LOH and expression of the reporter gene white produced light clones. The results demonstrated that both compounds were significantly genotoxic, with CPT being more effective than ETOP. Inter-chromosomal mitotic recombination was the major mechanism responsible for the induction of light spots by both compounds in XX females. Loss of the ring X chromosome (rX), was significantly enhanced by CPT, and this topoisomerase blocker also produced intra-chromosomal recombination (XY males).",2006,"AmÃ©rica Nitxin CastaÃ±eda SortibrÃ¡n, MarÃ­a Guadalupe Ordaz TÃ©llez, Rosario RodrÃ­guez-Arnaiz, AmÃ©rica Nitxin CastaÃ±eda SortibrÃ¡n, MarÃ­a Guadalupe Ordaz TÃ©llez, Rosario RodrÃ­guez-Arnaiz"

Dorsal closure is a morphogenetic process similar to wound healing, whereby a gap in the epithelium is closed through the coordinated action of different cell types. Surprisingly, this complex process requires microtubule function exclusively in epithelial cells and only for the last step, the zippering, which seals the gap. Preceding zippering, the epithelial microtubules reorganize to attain an unusual spatial distribution, which we describe with subcellular resolution in the intact, living organism. We provide a clearly defined example where cells of a developing organism transiently reorganize their microtubules to fulfill a specialized morphogenetic task.",2006,"Ferenc Jankovics, Damian Brunner, Ferenc Jankovics, Damian Brunner"
Selection and inbreeding depression: effects of inbreeding rate and inbreeding environment,16817541,,"The magnitude of inbreeding depression in small populations may depend on the effectiveness with which natural selection purges deleterious recessive alleles from populations during inbreeding. The effectiveness of this purging process, however, may be influenced by the rate of inbreeding and the environment in which inbreeding occurs. Although some experimental studies have examined these factors individually, no study has examined their joint effect or potential interaction. In the present study, therefore, we performed an experiment in which 180 lineages of Drosophila melanogaster were inbred at slow and fast inbreeding rates within each of three inbreeding environments (benign, high temperature, and competitive). The fitness of all lineages was then measured in a common benign environment. Although slow inbreeding reduced inbreeding depression in lineages inbred under high temperature stress, a similar reduction was not observed with respect to the benign or competitive treatments. Overall, therefore, the effect of inbreeding rate was nonsignificant. The inbreeding environment, in contrast, had a larger and more consistent effect on inbreeding depression. Under both slow and fast rates of inbreeding, inbreeding depression was significantly reduced in lineages inbred in the presence of a competitor D. melanogaster strain. A similar reduction of inbreeding depression occurred in lineages inbred under high temperature stress at a slow inbreeding rate. Overall, our findings show that inbreeding depression is reduced when inbreeding takes place in a stressful environment, possibly due to more effective purging under such conditions.",2006,"William R Swindell, Juan L Bouzat, William R Swindell, Juan L Bouzat"

There are two clades of GABA receptor subunits that include both vertebrate and invertebrate orthologues. In addition, I identified nine clades of anion channel subunits found only in invertebrates, including three that are specific to C. elegans and two found only in Drosophila. One well-defined clade of vertebrate cation channel subunits, the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits (nAChR), includes invertebrate orthologues. There are two clades of invertebrate nAChRs, one of alpha-type subunits and one of non-alpha subunits, that are most similar to the two clades of vertebrate neuronal and muscle alpha and non-alpha subunits. There is a large group of divergent C. elegans nAChR-like subunits partially resolved into clades but no orthologues of 5HT3-type serotonin receptors in the invertebrates.

We demonstrate that flies lacking either or both of these Scramblases are not compromised in vivo in processes requiring scrambling of phospholipids. Instead, we show that D. melanogaster lacking both Scramblases have more vesicles and display enhanced recruitment from a reserve pool of vesicles and increased neurotransmitter secretion at the larval neuromuscular synapses.

The binding sites for these transcription factors differ in the sequence, number, spacing, and position between the Drosophila and Musca tll enhancers, and we were unable to establish homology between binding sites from each species. This implies that the Musca and Drosophila Bcd-binding sites have evolved de novo in the 100 million years since these species diverged. However, in transgenic Drosophila embryos the Musca tll enhancer is able to drive the same expression pattern as endogenous Drosophila tll.

Survivor adults were unable to fly, probably due to abnormal cuticular development in the wing hinge regions of the thorax. Larvae fed a higher concentration (10 ppm) completed development within that instar, but died during ecdysis to the next instar, presumably due to inadequate cuticle synthesis. Third instar larvae pupariated, but the puparium was abnormal, and pupation did not occur. Adults fed 10 ppm showed normal viability but slightly depressed oogenesis; additionally, although their eggs were fertilized, they failed to hatch. Examination of the embryos showed that they completed development but were unable to perforate the surrounding vitelline membrane, probably due to a weakened chitinous mouth hook assembly that was insufficiently rigid to effect hatching.

In the chromosome substitution experiment, the geotaxis-line Y chromosomes were placed into high- and low-selected lines, Canton-S and Champaign wild-type backgrounds. The results of the chromosome substitution experiment provide evidence for a Y-chromosome effect on geotaxis in selected geotaxis lines, but not in wild-type stock, backgrounds. These results suggest that the Y chromosome has a small effect on geotaxis, whose detection depends on genetic and/or cytoplasmic background. The implications of these results are discussed for behaviour genetic analysis of D. melanogaster and for issues of statistical power in detecting small genetic effects.",1997,"S F Stoltenberg, J Hirsch, S F Stoltenberg, J Hirsch"
"Establishing primordia in the Drosophila eye-antennal imaginal disc: the roles of decapentaplegic, wingless and hedgehog",9428415,,"The eye-antennal imaginal discs of Drosophila melanogaster form the head capsule of the adult fly. Unlike the limb primordia, each eye-antennal disc gives rise to morphologically and functionally distinct structures. As a result, these discs provide an excellent model system for determining how the fates of primordia are specified during development. In this study, we investigated how the adjacent primordia of the compound eye and dorsal head vertex are specified. We show that the genes wingless (wg) and orthodenticle (otd) are expressed throughout the entire second instar eye-antennal disc, conferring a default fate of dorsal vertex cuticle. Activation of decapentaplegic (dpp) expression in the posterior eye disc eliminates wg and otd expression, thereby permitting eye differentiation. We also demonstrate that otd is activated by wg in the vertex primordium. Finally, we show that early activation of dpp depends on hedgehog (hh) expression in the eye anlage prior to morphogenetic furrow formation.",1997,"J Royet, R Finkelstein, J Royet, R Finkelstein"
The microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein is required for spindle orientation during germline cell divisions and oocyte differentiation in Drosophila,9199367,,"During animal development cellular differentiation is often preceded by an asymmetric cell division whose polarity is determined by the orientation of the mitotic spindle. In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, the oocyte differentiates in a 16-cell syncytium that arises from a cystoblast which undergoes 4 synchronous divisions with incomplete cytokinesis. During these divisions, spindle orientation is highly ordered and is thought to impart a polarity to the cyst that is necessary for the subsequent differentiation of the oocyte. Using mutations in the Drosophila cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain gene, Dhc64C, we show that cytoplasmic dynein is required at two stages of oogenesis. Early in oogenesis, dynein mutations disrupt spindle orientation in dividing cysts and block oocyte determination. The localization of dynein in mitotic cysts suggests spindle orientation is mediated by the microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein. Later in oogenesis, dynein function is necessary for proper differentiation, but does not appear to participate in morphogen localization within the oocyte. These results provide evidence for a novel developmental role for the cytoplasmic dynein motor in cellular determination and differentiation.",1997,"M McGrail, T S Hays, M McGrail, T S Hays"
"Wolbachia, normally a symbiont of Drosophila, can be virulent, causing degeneration and early death",9380712,10.1073/pnas.94.20.10792,"Wolbachia, a maternally transmitted microorganism of the Rickettsial family, is known to cause cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis, or feminization in various insect species. The bacterium-host relationship is usually symbiotic: incompatibility between infected males and uninfected females can enhance reproductive isolation and evolution, whereas the other mechanisms enhance progeny production. We have discovered a variant Wolbachia carried by Drosophila melanogaster in which this cozy relationship is abrogated. Although quiescent during the fly's development, it begins massive proliferation in the adult, causing widespread degeneration of tissues, including brain, retina, and muscle, culminating in early death. Tetracycline treatment of carrier flies eliminates both the bacteria and the degeneration, restoring normal life-span. The 16s rDNA sequence is over 98% identical to Wolbachia known from other insects. Examination of laboratory strains of D. melanogaster commonly used in genetic experiments reveals that a large proportion actually carry Wolbachia in a nonvirulent form, which might affect their longevity and behavior.",1997,"K T Min, S Benzer, K T Min, S Benzer"
Expression of the sex determining cascade genes Sex-lethal and doublesex in the phorid fly Megaselia scalaris,18464821,10.1139/g97-030,"Sex-lethal (Sxl) and doublesex (dsx) are known to represent parts of the sex-determining cascade in Drosophila melanogaster. We generated cDNA probes of the homologous genes from Megaselia scalaris, a fly species with an epistatic maleness factor as the primary sex determining signal. In Northern blot hybridization of poly(A)+ RNA, the M. scalaris dsx probe detected two bands, one of which had a sex-specific size difference, while the Sxl probe bound to RNAs of equal size in females and males. RT-PCR showed Sxl to be transcribed in gonads of adult females and males but not in somatic tissues. Thus, while dsx appears to have a similar function in M. scalaris and D. melanogaster, Sxl does not. The results suggest that the sex-determining pathway of M. scalaris joins that of D. melanogaster between the Sxl and dsx steps.",1997,"V Sievert, S Kuhn, W Traut, V Sievert, S Kuhn, W Traut"

Partial restoration of eye color (orange to red phenotype) in pupae and adults occurred in both sexes when first or second instar larvae were reared in water containing 3-hydroxykynurenine, the metabolic product of the enzyme kynurenine hydroxylase. No eye color restoration was observed when larvae were reared in water containing kynurenine sulfate, the precursor of 3-hydroxykynurenine in the ommochrome synthesis pathway. In addition, a plasmid clone containing the wild type Drosophila melanogaster gene encoding kynurenine hydroxylase, cinnabar (cn), was also able to complement the kynurenine hydroxylase mutation when it was injected into embryos of the A. aegypti WE strain. The ability to complement this A. aegypti mutant with the transiently expressed D. melanogaster cinnabar gene supports the value of this gene as a transformation reporter for use with A. aegypti WE and possibly other Diptera with null mutations in the kynurenine hydroxylase gene.",1997,"A J Cornel, M Q Benedict, C S Rafferty, A J Howells, F H Collins, A J Cornel, M Q Benedict, C S Rafferty, A J Howells, F H Collins"
Drosophila embryonic pattern repair: how embryos respond to bicoid dosage alteration,9118810,,"The product of the maternal effect gene, bicoid (bcd), is a transcription factor that acts in a concentration-dependent fashion to direct the establishment of anterior fates in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo. Embryos laid by mothers with fewer or greater than the normal two copies of bcd show initial alterations in the expression of the gap, segmentation and segment polarity genes, as well as changes in early morphological markers. In the absence of a fate map repair system, one would predict that these initial changes would result in drastic changes in the shape and size of larval and adult structures. However, these embryos develop into relatively normal larvae and adults. This indicates that there is plasticity in Drosophila embryonic development along the anterior-posterior axis. Embryos laid by mothers with six copies of bcd have reduced viability, indicating a threshold for repairing anterior-posterior mispatterning. We show that cell death plays a major role in correcting expanded regions of the fate map. There is a concomitant decrease of cell death in compressed regions of the fate map. We also show that compression of the fate map does not appear to be repaired by the induction of new cell divisions. In addition, some tissues are more sensitive to fate map compression than others.",1997,"R Namba, T M Pazdera, R L Cerrone, J S Minden, R Namba, T M Pazdera, R L Cerrone, J S Minden"

Molecular analysis of the intergenic region of the duplicated Amy genes of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila teissieri,9211732,10.1007/pl00006196,"The intergenic regions between the duplicated amylase coding regions (Amy) of D. melanogaster and D. teissieri were sequenced. Their lengths in D. melanogaster and D. teissieri were 4,536 bp and 4,621 bp, respectively. Since homology between the upstream regions of the two duplicated genes was found up to 450 bp from the initiation codon of the Amy genes, the ancestral Amy coding region duplicated together with at least 450 bp of the 5'-flanking region as one unit. Comparison of the regions between the two species revealed that the level of divergence was very heterogeneous. Although the mean level of the nucleotide difference in this region was 0.107, no nucleotide substitution was found in four subregions whose sizes were more than 100 bp. Since the probability of these four subregions being completely conserved between D. melanogaster and D. teissieri was very low, these subregions were considered to have relatively important roles in evolution. Large insertions and deletions were not observed in this region but small ones were observed all over the region except for an about 1-kb subregion. This 1-kb region corresponded to an open reading frame encoding a protein which had some sequence identity with the proteins of the serine protease inhibitor superfamily (serpin). Since we could find a transcript of this gene and the synonymous substitution rate was higher than the replacement substitution rate, we suggest that this gene encodes an active serpin in Drosophila.",1997,"E Okuyama, H Tachida, T Yamazaki, E Okuyama, H Tachida, T Yamazaki"
Molecular cloning of DNAs encoding the regulatory subunits of elongin from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster,9425272,10.1006/bbrc.1997.7819,"The Elongin complex strongly stimulates the rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II by suppressing transient pausing by polymerase at many sites along the DNA.

Here, we report the molecular cloning of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic DNA encoding Elongin C subunit and of Drosophila cDNAs encoding Elongin B and C subunits. The predicted amino acid sequence of each protein shows a high degree of similarity with the mammalian proteins. The recombinant yeast Elongin C protein interacts with both mammalian Elongin A and VHL tumor suppressor protein.

Identification of trans-acting genes necessary for centromere function in Drosophila melanogaster using centromere-defective minichromosomes,9055083,,"Deletions in the Drosophila minichromosome Dp1187 were used to investigate the genetic interactions of trans-acting genes with the centromere.

Heterozygous mutations in the ncd and klp3A kinesin-like protein genes strongly reduced the transmission of minichromosomes missing portions of the genetically defined centromere but had little effect on the transmission of minichromosomes with intact centromeres. Using this approach, ncd and klp3A were shown to require only the centromeric region of the chromosome for their roles in chromosome segregation. Increased gene dosage also affected minichromosome transmission and was used to demonstrate that the nod kinesin-like protein gene interacts genetically with the centro mere, in addition to interacting with extracentromeric regions as demonstrated previously. The results presented in this study strongly suggest that dominant genetic interactions between mutations and centromere-defective minichromosomes could be used effectively to identify novel genes necessary for centromere function.",1997,"K R Cook, T D Murphy, T C Nguyen, G H Karpen, K R Cook, T D Murphy, T C Nguyen, G H Karpen"

SEGREGATING VARIATION AND FITNESS,28565484,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb03963.x,"The number of ovarioles of the Drosophila melanogaster ovary is a trait thought to be associated with female fecundity, and therefore is expected to be under strong natural selection. This hypothesis may be tested by examining patterns of genetic and environmental variation for ovariole number in natural populations, and by determining the association between ovariole number and fitness in isogenic lines derived from a natural population. We measured ovariole number, and competitive fitness and its components, for 48 homozygous chromosome 3 substitution lines in a standard inbred background; and body size in a sample of 15 chromosome 3 substitution lines. We found significant segregating genetic variation for ovariole number, with a broad-sense heritability (H2 ) of 0.403 and correspondingly high coefficients of genetic variation (CVC = 20.8) and residual variation (CVR = 25.3). Estimates of quantitative genetic parameters for body size (H2 = 0.191, CVG = 2.15, and CVR = 3.87) are similar to those previously reported for this trait. Although the isogenic chromosome 3 substitution lines varied significantly for components of fitness, there was no significant linear or quadratic association of ovariole number and body size with fitness. There was, however, highly significant sex ? genotype interaction for fitness among these lines. This special case of genotype ? environment interaction for fitness may contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation for fitness in natural populations.",1997,"Marta L Wayne, J Brant Hackett, Trudy F C Mackay, Marta L Wayne, J Brant Hackett, Trudy F C Mackay"
The soluble alpha-mannosidases of Drosophila melanogaster,9404011,10.1016/s0965-1748(97)00041-6,"The alpha-mannosidases are implicated in both the catabolism of carbohydrates and the N-linked glycosylation pathway in insects, but little is known of the biochemistry of these glycosidases. In order to study the soluble alpha-mannosidases of Drosophila melanogaster we have used artificial fluorogenic substrates for detection of activity in situ following non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. This approach also permitted examination of the mannosidases present in different tissues and the sensitivity of the enzymes to known mannosidase inhibitors. Fluorogenic substrates were also used to determine the pH optima of partly purified mannosidases. We report that D. melanogaster contains several soluble alpha-mannosidase activities. Acidic mannosidases were detected in the gut, fat body and haemolymph of third-instar larvae.

These genes are required for differentiation and cell fate determination in the developing PNS. These findings, however, did not explain the failure of the nascent PNS precursors to undergo a normal cell cycle and divide. Here we show that four genes whose products are required for various stages of the cell cycle are misexpressed in the PNS of da mutant embryos.

This cluster is the largest cuticle gene cluster discovered to date and shows a number of surprising features that explain in part the genetic complexity of the LCP5, LCP6 and LCP8 loci. The genes encoding LCP5 and LCP8 are multiple copy genes and the presence of extensive similarity in their coding regions gives the first evidence for gene conversion in cuticle genes. In addition, five genes in the cluster are intronless. Four of these five have arisen by retroposition.

Patterns of connectivity in a Drosophila nerve,9331172,,"We investigated the spatial patterns of synaptic profiles in en passant synapses between the premotor axon of a peripherally synapsing interneuron (PAPSI) and a set of individually identifiable motoneuron axons in Drosophila melanogaster. These synaptic profiles are distributed as the axons travel parallel to each other in a bundle; the synapses begin as the axons leave the thoracic ganglion and continue peripherally for 45-65 microm. We found that the number of synaptic profiles per micron length of the motoneuron axons was greatest close to the ganglion; the cumulative distribution of profiles could be fitted to curves of the form f(x) = alpha(1 - e(-beta x)), where x = the distance from the thoracic ganglion, and alpha and beta are constants. The distribution of synaptic profiles was also examined in a mutant strain, Passover (Pas), known to affect connectivity in a pathway that includes the PAPSI. The synaptic profiles between the PAPSI and the motoneuron axons appeared ultrastructurally unremarkable in Pas. Also, the total number of synaptic profiles between the PAPSI and the motoneuron axons did not differ between Pas and wild type flies.

The overall deduced protein structure for Dmel/Nck is similar to that of mammalian Na+/Ca2+ exchanger genes NCX1 and NCX2, having six hydrophobic regions in the amino terminus separated from six at the carboxy-terminal end by a large intracellular loop. Sequence comparison of the Drosophila exchanger cDNAs with NCX1 and NCX2 Na+/Ca2+ exchangers are approximately 46% identical at the deduced amino acid level. Consensus phosphorylation sites for both protein kinase C and protein kinase A are present on the intracellular loop region of the Dmel/Nck. Alternative splicing for the Dmel/Nck gene is suggested in the same intracellular loop region as demonstrated for NCX1. Functionally, the Drosophila Na+/ Ca2+ exchanger expressed in oocytes differs from expressed mammalian NCX1 with regard to Ca2+ transport in Ca2+/ Ca2+ exchange and the effect of monovalent-dependent Ca2+/ Ca2+ exchange. The Dmel/Nck gene maps to chromosome 3 (93A-B) using in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes, the same position as the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, a related transporter.

The conservation of the nature and of the position of these mutations strongly suggests a role in the kdr mechanism. To determine if these mutations are associated with modifications of channel expression in adult flies, we investigated the localization of the Msc transcripts, and the size and the tissue distribution of the channel protein in pyrethroid-susceptible and super-kdr strains. Msc channels were mainly found in the cortical regions of the central nervous system with additional labeling in some neuronal processes and in the eyes. No qualitative or quantitative difference was observed between the strains. In immunoblotting experiments, anti-Msc antibodies bound to only one polypeptide of 260 kDa in adult brain.

Competitive interactions in Drosophila melanogaster: recurrent selection for aggression and response,3127362,10.1038/hdy.1988.19,"Recurrent selection programmes for both high response and low aggression have been employed in the Texas population of Drosophila melanogaster. Five main points have emerged from this investigation. First, the population exhibits extensive genetic variation for the aggression and response components of competitive interactions which take place in genetically heterogeneous cultures. Secondly, the two components of such interactions, namely aggression and response, can be adjusted by the selection of particular groups of genes. Thirdly, the rapid change in the selected components in the early generations suggests that a considerable amount of additive genetic variation is involved in the control of aggression and response. This is further supported by estimates of the realised heritability taken over the whole selection programme which amount to 0.79 and 0.74 for the low aggression and high response selections respectively. Fourthly, the rapidity with which changes in aggression and response approached plateaux suggests that such changes in the earlier generations are primarily due to the assortment of major chromosomes as units. Fifthly, it was concluded that aggression and response do not behave entirely independently or dependently. The results suggest that a single array of genes might be responsible for the determination of both characters. The observed results would then be consistent with certain of these genes having a much larger effect on aggression than they do on response.",1988,"M Hemmat, P Eggleston, M Hemmat, P Eggleston"
Mdg-1 mobile element polymorphism in selected Drosophila melanogaster populations,2852619,10.1007/BF00126005,"The changes in mdg-1 mobile element polymorphism that followed artificial selection for either high or low egg-to-adult viability in a Drosophila melanogaster population were investigated. The two selected subpopulations were thus characterized for fecundity, wing length, and number and location of the mdg-1 mobile element by in situ hybridization of the biotinylated--DNA on salivary gland chromosomes. The selected populations that differed greatly in egg-to-adult viability showed the same mean fecundity and identical values for intra and inter components of variances, intraclass correlation coefficient, and fluctuating asymmetry estimated on the wing length measurement. This indicates a non-correlated effect between deleterious mutations affecting viability and other fitness components. However, the two selected populations differed in their pattern of mdg-1 location, although the mean number of insertions per genome was not different from that of the initial population; hence, the number of insertions of the mdg-1 mobile element was independent of the effective population size. These results suggest that the mdg-1 copy number was regulated, and that during the selection process, drift and inbreeding made up new insertion patterns of the mdg-1 element in the selected populations. The results are discussed in the light of some recent theoretical models of the population dynamics of transposable elements.",1988,"C BiÃ©mont, C Terzian, C BiÃ©mont, C Terzian"

In D. melanogaster there were no significant differences in AdhF frequency between the orchard and winery populations. The ethanol tolerance of wild caught D. melanogaster males paralleled the levels of ethanol in the breeding sites but Adh alleles and ethanol tolerance segregated largely independently of each other. Levels of ADH activity were positively associated with the ethanol tolerance of the different populations and with levels of ethanol in the breeding sites, but it is argued that the ethanol levels are not causative.

Conditioning the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster by means of electric shocks,3128798,10.1073/pnas.85.8.2869,"Eighty male Drosophila melanogaster were observed individually for extended periods (1-2 hr) as they moved about in a small chamber consisting of a narrow, clear plastic ring whose vertical walls were thin epoxy plates with electric grids by means of which an 80-V shock could be delivered to the fly. Males (whether initially subjected to 0, 1, 2, or 3 electric shocks) that were observed for 10 consecutive 5-min sessions, given a supplemental electric shock (followed by a 2-min rest), and then observed for 5 additional 5-min sessions spent only 88.9% as much time on the grids after the supplemental shock as they had been spending earlier. This avoidance of the potentially electrified grids corresponds to that observed in tests involving the exposure of flies to 0, 1, 2, or 3 electric shocks preceding the 10 5-min sessions. The results reveal (i) an extreme variation in the normal behavior among unshocked (control) males and (ii) an exponential decline in the length of time spent on the grids immediately after receiving 1, 2, or 3 shocks. These data confirm earlier reports on the conditioning of behavior in Drosophila by means of electric shocks; in addition, they remove an ambiguity inherent in the earlier studies, which relied on a presumed exposure of each of 150 or more flies to each shock as it was delivered.",1988,"B Wallace, D Sperlich, B Wallace, D Sperlich"
Tumorous-head-type mutants of the distal bithorax complex cause dominant gain and recessive loss of function in Drosophila melanogaster,3119403,10.1016/0012-1606(88)90054-1,"The homeotic mutants tuh-3, SGA62, I127, and R17.32 are located in the abdominal portion of the bithorax complex in Drosophila melanogaster. The genes act as semidominants in the head, causing a gain of expression of leg, genitalia, tergite, or combinations of the structures. SGA62, tuh-3, and I127 additionally act as recessives in the posterior abdomen, causing a loss of these functions. Each mutant has its own focus of expression in the head region. I127 and tuh-3 can cause head defects only in the presence of the recessive maternal effect allele tuh-1h, while SGA62 and R17.32 cause head defects in the absence of this maternal effect. In the presence of the dominant tuh-1g maternal effect allele, the tuh-3 and I127 heads are normal. However, these flies now show a genital disc defect. SGA62 homozygotes have abdominal segments 6 and 7 transformed into a more anterior segment irrespective of the maternal effect in force. R17.32 appears to map to the abd-A domain, while SGA62, I127, and tuh-3 belong to Abd-B. SGA62 is located in the morphogenetic element of Abd-B, while I127 has characteristics of mutants affecting both the morphogenetic and regulatory elements of Abd-B.

The Abdominal-B gene of Drosophila melanogaster: overlapping transcripts exhibit two different spatial distributions,16453854,,The Abdominal-B (Abd-B) gene of Drosophila controls the specification of segment identities in the posterior abdomen. We describe here the spatial and temporal distribution of Abd-B transcripts. At least five RNA species are detected on Northern blots with probes within the region of the Abd-B homeobox. We have identified probes specific for subsets of these transcripts and have used these probes to study the distribution of each subset by in situ hybridization to embryonic tissue sections. The transcripts can be divided into two groups: one group is expressed maximally in parasegment (PS)13 and extends anteriorly to PS10; the other is expressed only in PS14 and 15. These two different patterns of expression correspond to the anatomical domains defined by two classes of mutations in Abd-B.

"Comparison of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) nuclear genes in the genomes of Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura and Anopheles gambiae",15693940,10.1186/gb-2005-6-2-r11,"Background:
      
    

    
      In eukaryotic cells, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) uses the products of both nuclear and mitochondrial genes to generate cellular ATP. Interspecies comparative analysis of these genes, which appear to be under strong functional constraints, may shed light on the evolutionary mechanisms that act on a set of genes correlated by function and subcellular localization of their products.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We have identified and annotated the Drosophila melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura and Anopheles gambiae orthologs of 78 nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation by a comparative analysis of their genomic sequences and organization. We have also identified 47 genes in these three dipteran species each of which shares significant sequence homology with one of the above-mentioned OXPHOS orthologs, and which are likely to have originated by duplication during evolution. Gene structure and intron length are essentially conserved in the three species, although gain or loss of introns is common in A. gambiae. In most tissues of D. melanogaster and A. gambiae the expression level of the duplicate gene is much lower than that of the original gene, and in D. melanogaster at least, its expression is almost always strongly testis-biased, in contrast to the soma-biased expression of the parent gene.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Quickly achieving an expression pattern different from the parent genes may be required for new OXPHOS gene duplicates to be maintained in the genome. This may be a general evolutionary mechanism for originating phenotypic changes that could lead to species differentiation.",2005,"Gaetano Tripoli, Domenica D'Elia, Paolo Barsanti, Corrado Caggese, Gaetano Tripoli, Domenica D'Elia, Paolo Barsanti, Corrado Caggese"
Functional analyses of tiptop and antennapedia in the embryonic development of Oncopeltus fasciatus suggests an evolutionary pathway from ground state to insect legs,15563520,10.1242/dev.01561,"In insects, selector genes are thought to modify the development of a default, or 'ground state', appendage into a tagma-specific appendage such as a mouthpart, antenna or leg. In the best described example, Drosophila melanogaster, the primary determination of leg identity is thought to result from regulatory interactions between the Hox genes and the antennal-specifying gene homothorax. Based on RNA-interference, a functional analysis of the selector gene tiptop and the Hox gene Antennapedia in Oncopeltus fasciatus embryogenesis is presented. It is shown that, in O. fasciatus, tiptop is required for the segmentation of distal leg segments and is required to specify the identity of the leg. The distal portions of legs with reduced tiptop develop like antennae. Thus, tiptop can act as a regulatory switch that chooses between antennal and leg identity. By contrast, Antennapedia does not act as a switch between leg and antennal identity. This observation suggests a significant difference in the mechanism of leg specification between O. fasciatus and D. melanogaster. These observations also suggest a significant plasticity in the mechanism of leg specification during insect evolution that is greater than would have been expected based on strictly morphological or molecular comparisons. Finally, it is proposed that a tiptop-like activity is a likely component of an ancestral leg specification mechanism. Incorporating a tiptop-like activity into a model of the leg-specification mechanism explains several mutant phenotypes, previously described in D. melanogaster, and suggests a mechanism for the evolution of legs from a ground state.",2005,"Scott W Herke, Nahum V Serio, Bryan T Rogers, Scott W Herke, Nahum V Serio, Bryan T Rogers"
Tribolium castaneum twist: gastrulation and mesoderm formation in a short-germ beetle,15645317,10.1007/s00427-004-0446-9,"Mesoderm formation has been extensively analyzed in the long-germ insect Drosophila melanogaster. In Drosophila, both the invagination and specification of the mesoderm is controlled by twist. Here we present a detailed description of mesoderm formation and twist regulation for the short-germ beetle Tribolium castaneum. In contrast to Drosophila, (1) the presumptive mesodermal cells of Tribolium are part of a mitotic domain and divide prior to ventral furrow formation, (2) ventral furrow formation progresses from posterior to anterior, (3) the number of cell layers within the furrow changes from multilayered in caudal to single layered in cephalic regions, and (4) there is a continuous production of mesodermal cells after gastrulation as new segments arise from the posterior growth zone. Tribolium twist (Tc-twist) is initially expressed in all presumptive mesodermal cells; however, after invagination, expression is maintained only in particular locations, which include the anterior compartments of the cephalic segments and a patch of cells at the posterior rim of the growth zone. The growth zone is multilayered with its inner cell layer being continuous with the mesoderm of the newly forming segments where twist expression is re-initiated anterior to the emerging engrailed stripes. A genomic region of Tc-twist was identified which drives ventral expression of a reporter construct in Drosophila. The expression of this Tc-twist construct in the background of Drosophila maternal mutations suggests that the dorsoventral system regulates Tc-twist, but that differences exist in regulation of the Dm-twist and Tc-twist genes by the terminal system.",2005,"Klaus Handel, Abidin Basal, Xiang Fan, Siegfried Roth, Klaus Handel, Abidin Basal, Xiang Fan, Siegfried Roth"
Modeling early Epstein-Barr virus infection in Drosophila melanogaster: the BZLF1 protein,16079238,10.1534/genetics.105.042572,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis and is associated with several forms of cancer, including lymphomas and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The EBV immediate-early protein BZLF1 functions as a transcriptional activator of EBV early gene expression and is essential for the viral transition between latent and lytic replication. In addition to its role in the EBV life cycle, BZLF1 (Z) also has profound effects upon the host cellular environment, including disruption of cell cycle regulation, signal transduction pathways, and transcription. In an effort to understand the nature of Z interactions with the host cellular environment, we have developed a Drosophila model of early EBV infection, where we have expressed Z in the Drosophila eye. Using this system, we have identified a highly conserved interaction between the Epstein-Barr virus Z protein and shaven, a Drosophila homolog of the human Pax2/5/8 family of genes. Pax5 is a well-characterized human gene involved with B-cell development. The B-cell-specific Pax5 also promotes the transcription of EBV latent genes from the EBV Wp promoter. Our work clearly demonstrates that the Drosophila system is an appropriate and powerful tool for identifying the underlying genetic networks involved in human infectious disease.",2005,"Amy L Adamson, Natasha Wright, Dennis R LaJeunesse, Amy L Adamson, Natasha Wright, Dennis R LaJeunesse"
Aging of the innate immune response in Drosophila melanogaster,15771614,10.1111/j.1474-9728.2005.00147.x,"Increased activation of the innate immune system is a common feature of aging animals, including mammals and Drosophila melanogaster. With age, D. melanogaster progressively express higher levels of many antimicrobial peptides. It is unknown, however, whether this pattern reflects age-dependent changes in the function of the immune system itself or arises simply because aged adults have greater cumulative exposure to pathogens. Here we demonstrate that aged D. melanogaster transcribe more antimicrobial diptericin when experimentally exposed to septic bacterial infections. This strong net response in older females is the result of persistent diptericin transcription upon septic exposure, whereas young females rapidly terminate this induction. In contrast to their response to septic exposure, when exposed to killed bacteria aged females have less capacity to induce diptericin. Because this functional capacity of innate immunity declines with age, we conclude that female Drosophila undergo immune senescence. Furthermore, we show that fecundity is reduced by induction of innate immunity via the immune deficiency pathway. Consequently, maximum reproduction will occur when the immune response is tightly controlled in young females, even if this increases infection risk at later ages.",2005,"Melissa Zerofsky, Ephat Harel, Neal Silverman, Marc Tatar"
The Drosophila mitochondrial ribosomal protein mRpL12 is required for Cyclin D/Cdk4-driven growth,15692573,10.1038/sj.emboj.7600523,"The Drosophila melanogaster cyclin-dependent protein kinase complex CycD/Cdk4 stimulates both cell cycle progression and cell growth (accumulation of mass). CycD/Cdk4 promotes cell cycle progression via the well-characterized RBF/E2F pathway, but our understanding of how growth is stimulated is still limited. To identify growth regulatory targets of CycD/Cdk4, we performed a loss-of-function screen for modifiers of CycD/Cdk4-induced overgrowth of the Drosophila eye. One mutation that suppressed CycD/Cdk4 was in a gene encoding the mitochondrial ribosomal protein, mRpL12. We show here that mRpL12 is required for CycD/Cdk4-induced cell growth. Cells homozygous mutant for mRpL12 have reduced mitochondrial activity, and exhibit growth defects that are very similar to those of cdk4 null cells. CycD/Cdk4 stimulates mitochondrial activity, and this is mRpL12 dependent. Hif-1 prolyl hydroxylase (Hph), another effector of CycD/Cdk4, regulates growth and is required for inhibition of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1 (Hif-1). Both functions depend on mRpL12 dosage, suggesting that CycD/Cdk4, mRpL12 and Hph function together in a common pathway that controls cell growth via affecting mitochondrial activity.",2005,"Christian Frei, Mireille Galloni, Ernst Hafen, Bruce A Edgar, Christian Frei, Mireille Galloni, Ernst Hafen, Bruce A Edgar"
Expression of defective proventriculus during head capsule development is conserved in Drosophila and stalk-eyed flies (Diopsidae),15834584,10.1007/s00427-005-0488-7,"Hypercephaly, in the form of lateral extensions of the head capsule, is observed in several families of Diptera. A particularly exaggerated form is found in Diopsid stalk-eyed flies, in which both eyes and antennae are laterally displaced at the end of stalks. The processes of early development and specification of the head capsule in stalk-eyed flies are similar to those in Drosophila melanogaster. In Drosophila the homeobox gene ocelliless (oc) shows a mediolateral gradient of expression across the region of the eye-antennal imaginal disc that gives rise to the head capsule and specifies the development of different head structures. The genes and developmental mechanisms that subsequently define head shape in Drosophila and produce hypercephaly in stalk-eyed flies remain unclear. To address this, we performed an enhancer trap screen for Drosophila genes expressed in the same region as oc and identified the homeobox gene defective proventriculus (dve). In the eye-antennal imaginal disc, dve is coexpressed with oc in the region that gives rise to the head capsule and is active along the medial edge of the antennal disc and in the first antennal segment. Analyses of dve expression in mutant eye-antennal discs are consistent with it acting downstream of oc in the development of the head capsule. We confirm that orthologues of dve are present in a diverse panel of five stalk-eyed fly species and analyse patterns of dve sequence variation within the clade. Our results indicate that dve expression and sequence are both highly conserved in stalk-eyed flies.",2005,"Martin Carr, Imogen Hurley, Kevin Fowler, Andrew Pomiankowski, Hazel K Smith, Martin Carr, Imogen Hurley, Kevin Fowler, Andrew Pomiankowski, Hazel K Smith"
Molecular response of Drosophila melanogaster tyramine receptor cascade to plant essential oils,15763467,10.1016/j.ibmb.2004.12.007,"This paper reports the role of the tyramine (TA) receptor cascade in the insecticidal activity of plant essential oils. A TA receptor cDNA encoding a putative seven transmembrane domain G-protein coupled receptor was amplified from Drosophila melanogaster head cDNA phage library. The encoded protein contains 601 amino acids and has a sequence similar to other biogenic amine receptors. This protein was expressed in Drosophila S2 cells for radioligand binding studies with the ligand 3H-TA. Competitive binding studies comparing biogenic amines that could potentially function as endogenous ligands have demonstrated that this receptor had the highest affinity for TA (Ki=1.27 microM) followed by DL-octopamine, dopamine, serotonin and histamine. TA decreased the forskolin-increased cAMP levels (IC50=5.802 microM) and increased [Ca2+]i through the receptor expressed in S2 cells. The toxicity rank order of the tested plant essential oils against wild type D. melanogaster fly demonstrated a pattern similar to their effect on receptor binding activity and changes in cAMP level and [Ca2+]i. The toxicity of two of these chemicals was eliminated when tested against the TA receptor mutant (TyrRneo30) Drosophila strain. Therefore, the data indicates a correlation between cellular changes and insecticidal activity of tested plant essential oils, and suggests that the toxicity of at least two of these chemicals is mediated through the TA receptor.",2005,"Essam E Enan, Essam E Enan"

At 96 +/- 2 hr, the anterior midgut of control and treated larvae was dissected out; single cell suspensions were prepared; and the comet assay was performed on the cells. All the leachates produced significant (P < 0.05), dose-dependent increases in DNA damage, in the gut cells. Leachates prepared at pH 7.0 were significantly less genotoxic than leachates prepared at pH 4.93 or 2.88. A comparison of the comet parameters among the exposed groups indicated that leachates of the pigment plant solid waste produced the least DNA damage, while leachates prepared from the flashlight battery factory solid waste were the most genotoxic. The present study indicates that leachates of solid wastes from flashlight battery factories, pigment plants, and tanneries possess genotoxic activity and that D. melanogaster is a useful in vivo model for assessing the genotoxicity of these potential environmental contaminants.",2005,"Hifzur R Siddique, Subash C Gupta, Alok Dhawan, R C Murthy, D K Saxena, D Kar Chowdhuri, Hifzur R Siddique, Subash C Gupta, Alok Dhawan, R C Murthy, D K Saxena, D Kar Chowdhuri"
Basigin (EMMPRIN/CD147) interacts with integrin to affect cellular architecture,15928045,10.1242/jcs.02408,"Basigin, an IgG family glycoprotein found on the surface of human metastatic tumors, stimulates fibroblasts to secrete matrix metalloproteases that remodel the extracellular matrix. Using Drosophila melanogaster we identify intracellular, matrix metalloprotease-independent, roles for basigin. Specifically, we found that basigin, interacting with integrin, is required for normal cell architecture in some cell types. Basigin promotes cytoskeletal rearrangements and the formation of lamellipodia in cultured insect cells. Loss of basigin from photoreceptors leads to misplaced nuclei, rough ER and mitochondria, as well as to swollen axon terminals. These changes in intracellular structure suggest cytoskeletal disruptions. These defects can be rescued by either fly or mouse basigin. Basigin and integrin colocalize to cultured cells and to the visual system. Basigin-mediated changes in the architecture of cultured cells require integrin binding activity. Basigin and integrin interact genetically to affect cell structure in the animal, possibly by forming complexes at cell contacts that help organize internal cell structure.",2005,"Kathryn D Curtin, Ian A Meinertzhagen, Robert J Wyman, Kathryn D Curtin, Ian A Meinertzhagen, Robert J Wyman"
Developmental instability of the Drosophila wing as an index of genomic perturbation and altered cell proliferation,15876196,10.1111/j.1525-142X.2005.05026.x,"We experimentally induced different levels of instability affecting the development of specific wing regions of Drosophila melanogaster using the UAS-GAL4 system. A common index of developmental instability is fluctuating asymmetry (FA), that is, random differences between body sides of single individuals. We studied the FA in transgenic strains carrying random genomic insertions (UAS strains), as well as insertions in the regulatory region of genes involved in the organization of wing development (GAL4 strains). In addition, the expression of genes that increase (dp110 and 3622) or decrease (dPTEN) cell proliferation was ectopically induced. Our results are related to different levels of perturbation. Through the first kind of perturbation, genome integrity was compromised by the insertion of foreign DNA. In all cases, we observed a general increase in FA, although it was rarely found significant. The second kind of perturbation involved a modification of genes controlling wing development through the insertion of a GAL4 sequence in their promoter region. The third kind involved the ectopic expression of genes controlling cell proliferation. Our results show that (i) the level of FA is connected with the level of morphological perturbation induced, (ii) FA increase was higher in the wing regions that were the target of the genetic perturbation, and (iii) developmental instability was also observed in regions that were not directly addressed by the perturbation.

Impairment of cytotype regulation of P-element activity in Drosophila melanogaster by mutations in the Su(var)205 gene,15998729,10.1534/genetics.102.001594,"Cytotype regulation of transposable P elements in the germ line of Drosophila melanogaster is associated with maternal transmission of P elements inserted at the left telomere of the X chromosome. This regulation is impaired in long-term stocks heterozygous for mutations in Suppressor of variegation 205 [Su(var)205], a gene implicated in the control of telomere length. Regulation by TP5, a structurally incomplete P element at the X telomere, is more profoundly impaired than regulation by TP6, a different incomplete P element inserted at the same site in a TAS repeat at the X telomere. Genetic analysis with the TP5 element indicates that its regulatory ability is not impaired in flies whose fathers came directly from a stock heterozygous for a Su(var)205 mutation, even when the flies themselves carry this mutation. However, it is impaired in flies whose grandfathers came from such a stock. Furthermore, this impairment occurs even when the Su(var)205 mutation is not present in the flies themselves or in their mothers. The impaired regulatory ability of TP5 persists for at least several generations after TP5 X chromosomes extracted from a long-term mutant Su(var)205 stock are made homozygous in the absence of the Su(var)205 mutation. Impairment of TP5-mediated regulation is therefore not directly dependent on the Su(var)205 mutation. However, it is characteristic of the six mutant Su(var)205 stocks that were tested and may be related to the elongated telomeres that develop in these stocks. Impairment of regulation by TP5 is also seen in a stock derived from Gaiano, a wild-type strain that has elongated telomeres due to a dominant mutation in the Telomere elongation (Tel) gene. Regulation by TP6 is not impaired in the Gaiano genetic background. The regulatory abilities of the TP5 and TP6 elements are therefore not equally susceptible to the effects of elongated telomeres in the mutant Su(var)205 and Gaiano stocks.",2005,"Kevin J Haley, Jeremy R Stuart, John D Raymond, Jarad B Niemi, Michael J Simmons, Kevin J Haley, Jeremy R Stuart, John D Raymond, Jarad B Niemi, Michael J Simmons"

Patterns of intron sequence evolution in Drosophila are dependent upon length and GC content,16086849,10.1186/gb-2005-6-8-r67,"Background:
      
    

    
      Introns comprise a large fraction of eukaryotic genomes, yet little is known about their functional significance. Regulatory elements have been mapped to some introns, though these are believed to account for only a small fraction of genome wide intronic DNA. No consistent patterns have emerged from studies that have investigated general levels of evolutionary constraint in introns.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We examine the relationship between intron length and levels of evolutionary constraint by analyzing inter-specific divergence at 225 intron fragments in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, sampled from a broad distribution of intron lengths. We document a strongly negative correlation between intron length and divergence. Interestingly, we also find that divergence in introns is negatively correlated with GC content. This relationship does not account for the correlation between intron length and divergence, however, and may simply reflect local variation in mutational rates or biases.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Short introns make up only a small fraction of total intronic DNA in the genome. Our finding that long introns evolve more slowly than average implies that, while the majority of introns in the Drosophila genome may experience little or no selective constraint, most intronic DNA in the genome is likely to be evolving under considerable constraint. Our results suggest that functional elements may be ubiquitous within longer introns and that these introns may have a more general role in regulating gene expression than previously appreciated. Our finding that GC content and divergence are negatively correlated in introns has important implications for the interpretation of the correlation between divergence and levels of codon bias observed in Drosophila.",2005,"Penelope R Haddrill, Brian Charlesworth, Daniel L Halligan, Peter Andolfatto, Penelope R Haddrill, Brian Charlesworth, Daniel L Halligan, Peter Andolfatto"

In this report, we analyze the effects of eu-heterochromatic rearrangements involving a cluster of the X-linked heterochromatic (Xh) Stellate repeats on the representation of these sequences in salivary gland polytene chromosomes. The discontinuous heterochromatic Stellate cluster contains specific restriction fragments that were mapped along the distal region of Xh. We found that transposition of a fragment of the Stellate cluster into euchromatin resulted in its replication in polytene chromosomes. Interestingly, only the Stellate repeats that remain within the pericentric Xh and are close to a new eu-heterochromatic boundary were replicated, strongly suggesting the existence of a spreading effect exerted by the adjacent euchromatin. Internal rearrangements of the distal Xh did not affect Stellate polytenization. We also demonstrated trans effects exerted by heterochromatic blocks on the replication of the rearranged heterochromatin; replication of transposed Stellate sequences was suppressed by a deletion of Xh and restored by addition of Y heterochromatin.

A subset of mutations at this locus cause characteristic alterations in the male mating song, manifest as polycyclic pulses with higher than normal amplitude. This phenotype has been postulated to result from disruption of an oscillator involving the cac-encoded channel, nearly identical to a model proposed for the pacemaker of the Drosophila heart. We report here that flies bearing two intragenic mutations that affect song, cac(S) and cac(TS2), cause aberrant heartbeating. Hearts of both cac(S) and cac(TS2) mutants beat significantly more rapidly than wild type and the heartbeat is more regular across temperature. Deletions of the cac gene, heterozygous with cac(+), caused interestingly similar heartbeating anomalies. For the heart phenotypes, the mutations are dominant, unlike the effects of cac(S) on song. In sum, our results establish the hypothesis that the observed effects are a result of a reduced number of functional cac-encoded channels rather than any specific alteration in the protein, and that in addition to Dmca1A, a second Ca(2+) channel with different kinetics is also involved in pacemaking.",2005,"Vanessa M Ray, Harold B Dowse, Vanessa M Ray, Harold B Dowse"

The importance of experimental design and sample preparation, in line with minimum information about microarray experiment (MIAME) compliance, is emphasised. The technical platforms available to the Drosophila neurobiologist have been illustrated and a brief number of data analysis tools that are readily available reviewed.",2005,"Christopher J Mee, Christopher J Mee"
Protein interaction mapping: a Drosophila case study,15710747,10.1101/gr.2659105,"The Drosophila (fruit fly) model system has been instrumental in our current understanding of human biology, development, and diseases. Here, we used a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid (Y2H)-based technology to screen 102 bait proteins from Drosophila melanogaster, most of them orthologous to human cancer-related and/or signaling proteins, against high-complexity fly cDNA libraries. More than 2300 protein-protein interactions (PPI) were identified, of which 710 are of high confidence. The computation of a reliability score for each protein-protein interaction and the systematic identification of the interacting domain combined with a prediction of structural/functional motifs allow the elaboration of known complexes and the identification of new ones. The full data set can be visualized using a graphical Web interface, the PIMRider (http://pim.hybrigenics.com), and is also accessible in the PSI standard Molecular Interaction data format. Our fly Protein Interaction Map (PIM) is surprisingly different from the one recently proposed by Giot et al. with little overlap between the two data sets.

A study of canalization and developmental stability in the sternopleural bristle system of Drosophila melanogaster,16153035,,"Among the explanations for minimizing the effects of extraneous variation has been canalization and developmental stability. However, there is little agreement as to whether these two processes reflect a common set of mechanisms. This confusion is inflated due to the lack of consensus as to a precise definition of canalization. In this study, canalization in the sternopleural bristle system is used to investigate the relationships between measures of canalization and developmental stability by comparing how a panel of naturally derived lines responds to both genetic and environmental perturbations. No evidence for a common mechanism between the different measures of canalization was observed. Furthermore, a hypothesis regarding a common mechanism for environmental and genetic canalization was tested, and no evidence was found to support it. However, there is evidence for a relationship between at least one form of canalization and developmental stability.",2005,"Ian Dworkin, Ian Dworkin"
Identification and characterization of a Drosophila proteasome regulatory network,15899868,10.1128/MCB.25.11.4662-4675.2005,"Maintaining adequate proteasomal proteolytic activity is essential for eukaryotic cells. For metazoan cells, little is known about the composition of genes that are regulated in the proteasome network or the mechanisms that modulate the levels of proteasome genes. Previously, two distinct treatments have been observed to induce 26S proteasome levels in Drosophila melanogaster cell lines, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated inhibition of the 26S proteasome subunit Rpn10/S5a and suppression of proteasome activity through treatment with active-site inhibitors. We have carried out genome array profiles from cells with decreased Rpn10/S5a levels using RNAi or from cells treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 and have thereby identified candidate genes that are regulated as part of a metazoan proteasome network. The profiles reveal that the majority of genes that were identified to be under the control of the regulatory network consisted of 26S proteasome subunits. The 26S proteasome genes, including three new subunits, Ubp6p, Uch-L3, and Sem1p, were found to be up-regulated. A number of genes known to have proteasome-related functions, including Rad23, isopeptidase T, sequestosome, and the genes for the segregase complex TER94/VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 were also found to be up-regulated. RNAi-mediated inhibition against the segregase complex genes demonstrated pronounced stabilization of proteasome substrates throughout the Drosophila cell. Finally, transcriptional reporter assays and deletion mapping studies in Drosophila demonstrate that proteasome mRNA induction is dependent upon the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs). Transfer of the 5' UTR from the proteasome subunit Rpn1/S2 to a noninducible promoter was sufficient to confer transcriptional upregulation of the reporter mRNA after proteasome inhibition.",2005,"Josefin Lundgren, Patrick Masson, Zahra Mirzaei, Patrick Young, Josefin Lundgren, Patrick Masson, Zahra Mirzaei, Patrick Young"

A microarray analysis of genes involved in relating egg production to nutritional intake in Drosophila melanogaster,15776001,10.1038/sj.cdd.4401587,"Egg chambers of Drosophila are reabsorbed under conditions of nutritional shortage by inducing apoptosis at stages 8 and 9, midway through oogenesis. Nutritional shortage leads to an increase in ecdysone concentration in flies. Apoptosis at stage 8/9 is also induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone injection into the females maintained with adequate nutrition. The expression pattern in the ovary of some ecdysone response genes, E75A, BR-C, is different according to the nutritional environment and the overexpression of these genes induces apoptosis. Apoptosis is suppressed by Juvenile hormone analog treatment of females under nutritional shortage. We predict nutritional and stress response genes control hormone levels and the increase in ecdysone concentration in the flies following starvation induces the ovarian apoptosis. We therefore used a microarray approach to identify the genes involved in receiving the nutritional signal from the environment and translating it in the ovary, thus initiating and executing apoptosis.",2005,"J Terashima, M Bownes, J Terashima, M Bownes"
Photic input pathways that mediate the Drosophila larval response to light and circadian rhythmicity are developmentally related but functionally distinct,15593374,10.1002/cne.20383,"The Drosophila melanogaster larval photosensory organ that mediates the response to light consists of bilaterally symmetrical clusters of 12 photoreceptors. These are distinguished on the basis of expression of the rhodopsins Rh5 and Rh6. The Rh6-expressing cells correspond to the Hofbauer-Buchner (H-B) eyelet found later in the posterior margin of the adult compound eye and recently shown to function as an input pathway in the entrainment of circadian rhythmicity in adult Drosophila. In addition, the axons of the larval photoreceptors are found in intimate association with a subset of the main circadian pacemaker neurons located in the developing accessory medulla, the small ventral lateral neurons (LNv). The observed spatial overlap between components of the circadian circuitry, input pathway, and pacemaker neurons-and the larval visual organ-suggest a functional relationship between these two photosensory input pathways. In this study we determined the requirement of specific rhodopsin-expressing photoreceptors including the presumptive H-B eyelet and pacemaker neurons in the larval locomotory response to visual stimuli. Our results demonstrate that two of the most important components of the neuronal circuitry underlying circadian rhythmicity in Drosophila, namely, the extraretinal H-B cluster and the circadian pacemakers, while in intimate association with the larval visual system are not required for the larval motor response to light.",2005,"Jana Hassan, Balaji Iyengar, Nadia Scantlebury, Veronica Rodriguez Moncalvo, Ana Regina Campos, Jana Hassan, Balaji Iyengar, Nadia Scantlebury, Veronica Rodriguez Moncalvo, Ana Regina Campos"
Microcolumn separation of amine metabolites in the fruit fly,16097779,10.1021/ac050474m,"Electrophoretic resolution of 14 biogenic amines and metabolites with similar mobilities is addressed by employing micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography coupled to amperometric electrochemical detection. The present study describes the optimization of separation conditions to achieve resolution of analytes of biological significance within 20 min in a single separation. They include dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, octopamine (OA), L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, tyramine (TA), and serotonin as well as metabolites 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanillic acid, and 3-methoxytyramine in addition to N-acetylated metabolites including N-acetyldopamine, N-acetyloctopamine (naOA), and N-acetylserotonin. The optimized conditions used result in excellent reproducibility and predictable peak shifting, thus enabling identification of several metabolites along with their biogenic amine precursors in biological samples, specifically from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The separation method is sensitive, selective, and quantitative as demonstrated by its capacity to detect changes in TA, OA, and naOA present in the head homogenates of the Canton-S and mutant inactive(1) Drosophila lines. Quantitative analysis of metabolites in conjunction with their biogenic amine precursors in a single separation offers tremendous potential to understand the physiological processes and underlying mechanisms mediated by various biogenic amines in Drosophila and other animals.",2005,"Tracy L Paxon, Paula R Powell, Hyun-Gwan Lee, Kyung-An Han, Andrew G Ewing, Tracy L Paxon, Paula R Powell, Hyun-Gwan Lee, Kyung-An Han, Andrew G Ewing"

Regulation of aversion to noxious food by Drosophila neuropeptide Y- and insulin-like systems,16172603,10.1038/nn1540,"Omnivores, including humans, have an inborn tendency to avoid noxious or unfamiliar foods. Such defensive foraging behaviors are modifiable, however, in response to physiological needs. Here we describe a method for assessing risk-sensitive food acquisition in Drosophila melanogaster. Food-deprived fly larvae become more likely to feed on noxious foods (adulterated with quinine) as the duration of deprivation increases. The neuropeptide F receptor NPFR1, a mammalian neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor homolog, centrally regulates the response to noxious food in D. melanogaster. Overexpression of NPFR1 was sufficient to cause nondeprived larvae to more readily take in noxious food, whereas loss of NPFR1 signaling led to the opposite phenotype. Moreover, NPFR1 neuronal activity may be directly regulated by the insulin-like signaling pathway. Upregulation of insulin-like receptor signaling in NPFR1 cells suppressed the feeding response to noxious food. Our results suggest that the coordinated activities of the conserved NPY- and insulin-like receptor signaling systems are essential for the dynamic regulation of noxious food intake according to the animal's energy state.",2005,"Qi Wu, Zhangwu Zhao, Ping Shen, Qi Wu, Zhangwu Zhao, Ping Shen"
The role of mPer1 in morphine dependence in mice,15664694,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2004.09.012,"Investigations using Drosophila melanogaster have shown that the circadian clock gene period can influence behavioral responses to cocaine, and the mouse homologues, mPer1 and mPer2, modulate cocaine sensitization and reward. In the present study, we applied DNAzyme targeting mPer1 to interfere the expression of mPer1 in CNS in mice and studied the role of mPer1 on morphine dependence. We found that the DNAzyme could attenuate the expression of mPer1 in CNS in mice. Mice treated with DNAzyme and morphine synchronously did not show preference to the morphine-trained side, whereas the control group did. In contrast, mice treated with DNAzyme after morphine showed preference to the morphine-trained side as well as the control group did. These results indicate that drug dependence seems to be influenced at least partially by mPer1, but mPer1 cannot affect morphine dependence that has been formed.",2005,"Y Liu, Y Wang, C Wan, W Zhou, T Peng, Y Liu, Z Wang, G Li, G Cornelisson, F Halberg, Y Liu, Y Wang, C Wan, W Zhou, T Peng, Y Liu, Z Wang, G Li, G Cornelisson, F Halberg"
Drosophila soluble guanylyl cyclase mutants exhibit increased foraging locomotion: behavioral and genomic investigations,15864439,10.1007/s10519-005-3216-1,"Genetic variation in the gene foraging (for) is associated with a natural behavioral dimorphism in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Some larvae, called 'rovers', have increased foraging locomotion compared to others, called 'sitters', and this difference is directly related to for-encoded cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) activity. Here we report that larvae with mutations in the gene dgcalpha1, which encodes a soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) subunit, have increases in both PKG activity and foraging locomotion. This is contrary to our original prediction that, based on the role of sGC in the synthesis of cGMP, dgcalpha1 mutant larvae would have deficient cGMP production leading to decreased PKG activation and thus reduced larval foraging locomotion. We performed DNA microarray analyses to compare transcriptional changes induced by a dgcalpha1 mutation in both rover and sitter wildtype genetic backgrounds. In either background, we identified many genes that are differentially transcribed, and interestingly, relatively few are affected in both backgrounds. Furthermore, several of these commonly affected genes are enhanced or suppressed in a background-dependent manner. Thus, genetic background has a critical influence on the molecular effects of this mutation. These findings will support future investigations of Drosophila foraging behavior.",2005,"Craig A L Riedl, Scott J Neal, Alain Robichon, J Timothy Westwood, Marla B Sokolowski, Craig A L Riedl, Scott J Neal, Alain Robichon, J Timothy Westwood, Marla B Sokolowski"
Tests for the replication of an association between Egfr and natural variation in Drosophila melanogaster wing morphology,16102176,10.1186/1471-2156-6-44,"Background:
      
    

    
      Quantitative differences between individuals stem from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, with the heritable variation being shaped by evolutionary forces. Drosophila wing shape has emerged as an attractive system for genetic dissection of multi-dimensional traits. We utilize several experimental genetic methods to validation of the contribution of several polymorphisms in the Epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) gene to wing shape and size, that were previously mapped in populations of Drosophila melanogaster from North Carolina (NC) and California (CA). This re-evaluation utilized different genetic testcrosses to generate heterozygous individuals with a variety of genetic backgrounds as well as sampling of new alleles from Kenyan stocks.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Only one variant, in the Egfr promoter, had replicable effects in all new experiments. However, expanded genotyping of the initial sample of inbred lines rendered the association non-significant in the CA population, while it persisted in the NC sample, suggesting population specific modification of the quantitative trait nucleotide QTN effect.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Dissection of quantitative trait variation to the nucleotide level can identify sites with replicable effects as small as one percent of the segregating genetic variation. However, the testcross approach to validate QTNs is both labor intensive and time-consuming, and is probably less useful than resampling of large independent sets of outbred individuals.",2005,"Arnar Palsson, James Dodgson, Ian Dworkin, Greg Gibson, Arnar Palsson, James Dodgson, Ian Dworkin, Greg Gibson"
Variable splicing of non-coding roX2 RNAs influences targeting of MSL dosage compensation complexes in Drosophila,17114930,10.4161/rna.2.4.2473,"The non-coding roX1 and roX2 RNAs are components of the MSL dosage compensation complex in Drosophila. We found that multiple species of roX2 RNA are produced by alternative splicing, with one major and at least 20 different minor forms associated with MSL proteins. The alternative forms are generated by variable usage of multiple 5' and 3' splice sites between two common exons. This alternative splicing is evolutionarily conserved in several distant Drosophila species in spite of differences in primary sequences. Transgenic constructs expressing individual major or minor D. melanogaster roX2 species display low steady-state levels of roX2 RNA, weak accumulation of MSL complex on the X chromosome, and low rescue of male-specific roX(-) lethality. Increased expression of individual roX2 forms using the constitutive Hsp83 promoter results in increased transgenic rescue of roX(-) mutant male flies. However, although males survive they are delayed in their development. In addition, MSL complexes still show low affinity for the X chromosome and abnormal accumulation at the transgenic site of synthesis of the individual roX2 alternative splice form. Taken together, these results suggest an important role for roX2 RNA splicing in optimal MSL complex assembly or function.",2005,"Yongkyu Park, Hyangyee Oh, Victoria H Meller, Mitzi I Kuroda, Yongkyu Park, Hyangyee Oh, Victoria H Meller, Mitzi I Kuroda"

"The lesswright mutation activates Rel-related proteins, leading to overproduction of larval hemocytes in Drosophila melanogaster",15882582,10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.02.006,"The lesswright (lwr) gene encodes an enzyme that conjugates a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO). Since the conjugation of SUMO occurs in many different proteins, a variety of cellular processes probably require lwr function. Here, we demonstrate that lwr function regulates the production of blood cells (hemocytes) in Drosophila larvae. lwr mutant larvae develop many melanotic tumors in the hemolymph at the third instar stage. The formation of melanotic tumors is due to a large number of circulating hemocytes, which is approximately 10 times higher than those of wild type. This overproduction of hemocytes is attributed to the loss of lwr function primarily in hemocytes and the lymph glands, a hematopoietic organ in Drosophila larvae. High incidences of Dorsal (Dl) protein in the nucleus were observed in lwr mutant hemocytes, and the dl and Dorsal-related immunity factor (Dif) mutations were found to be suppressors of the lwr mutation. Therefore, the lwr mutation leads to the activation of these Rel-related proteins, key transcription factors in hematopoiesis. We also demonstrate that dl and Dif play different roles in hematopoiesis. dl primarily stimulates plasmatocyte production, but Dif controls both plasmatocyte and lamellocyte production.",2005,"Liang Huang, Shunji Ohsako, Soichi Tanda, Liang Huang, Shunji Ohsako, Soichi Tanda"

The same specific molecular mechanisms may be responsible, for example, for both hereditary and nonhereditary variability depending on the taxonomic status. Some mechanisms responsible for both mutations and modifications or for mutations, recombination, and ontogenetic variability have been considered from this viewpoint.

The homologous Drosophila transcriptional adaptors ADA2a and ADA2b are both required for normal development but have different functions,16135810,10.1128/MCB.25.18.8215-8227.2005,"In Drosophila and several other metazoan organisms, there are two genes that encode related but distinct homologs of ADA2-type transcriptional adaptors.

By using mutant Drosophila lines, which allow the functional study of individual ADA2s, we demonstrate that both Drosophila Ada2 genes are essential. Ada2a and Ada2b null homozygotes are late-larva and late-pupa lethal, respectively. Double mutants have a phenotype identical to that of the Ada2a mutant. The overproduction of ADA2a protein from transgenes cannot rescue the defects resulting from the loss of Ada2b, nor does complementation work vice versa, indicating that the two Ada2 genes of Drosophila have different functions. An analysis of germ line mosaics generated by pole-cell transplantation revealed that the Ada2a function (similar to that reported for Ada2b) is required in the female germ line. A loss of the function of either of the Ada2 genes interferes with cell proliferation. Interestingly, the Ada2b null mutation reduces histone H3 K14 and H3 K9 acetylation and changes TAF10 localization, while the Ada2a null mutation does not. Moreover, the two ADA2s are differently required for the expression of the rosy gene, involved in eye pigment production, and for Dmp53-mediated apoptosis.

Spindle self-organization and cytokinesis during male meiosis in asterless mutants of Drosophila melanogaster,9700163,10.1083/jcb.142.3.751,"While Drosophila female meiosis is anastral, both meiotic divisions in Drosophila males exhibit prominent asters. We have identified a gene we call asterless (asl) that is required for aster formation during male meiosis. Ultrastructural analysis showed that asl mutants have morphologically normal centrioles. However, immunostaining with antibodies directed either to gamma tubulin or centrosomin revealed that these proteins do not accumulate in the centrosomes, as occurs in wild-type. Thus, asl appears to specify a function required for the assembly of centrosomal material around the centrioles. Despite the absence of asters, meiotic cells of asl mutants manage to develop an anastral spindle. Microtubules grow from multiple sites around the chromosomes, and then focus into a peculiar bipolar spindle that mediates chromosome segregation, although in a highly irregular way. Surprisingly, asl spermatocytes eventually form a morphologically normal ana-telophase central spindle that has full ability to stimulate cytokinesis. These findings challenge the classical view on central spindle assembly, arguing for a self-organization of this structure from either preexisting or newly formed microtubules.

These mutations include the inversions In(1)w(m4) and In(2R)bw(VDe2), which are classical chromosomal rearrangements that typify PEV mutations. The other mutations are a derivative of brown(Dominant), in which brown+ reporters are inactivated by a large block of heterochromatin, and a P[white+] transposon insertion associated with second chromosome heterochromatin. In general, we find that class I modifiers affect both classical and nonclassical PEV mutations, whereas class II modifiers affect only classical PEV mutations. We suggest that class II modifiers affect chromatin architecture in the vicinity of reporter genes, and only class I modifiers identify proteins that are potentially involved in heterochromatin formation or maintenance. In addition, our observations support a model in which there are different constraints on the process of heterochromatin-induced silencing in classical vs. nonclassical PEV mutations.",1998,"G L Sass, S Henikoff, G L Sass, S Henikoff"
HERITABLE VARIATION FOR FECUNDITY IN FIELD-COLLECTED DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER AND THEIR OFFSPRING REARED UNDER DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURES,28568166,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1998.tb05146.x,"Heritable variation for fitness components is normally measured under favorable laboratory conditions, but organisms in the field experience variable conditions that are often stressful and may affect the expression of heritable variation. We examined heritable variation for early fecundity in three samples of Drosophila melanogaster from the field. Flies were obtained from a rotting fruit pile in summer, autumn, and spring, and progeny were reared under laboratory conditions. Field parents were tested for fecundity at 14Â°C or 28Â°C depending on ambient temperatures. Wing/thorax length ratios measured on flies from the spring collection suggested that flies had developed at around 20Â°C. Progeny were reared and tested at 14Â°C, 25Â°C, and 28Â°C. In the summer collection, parent-offspring regression coefficients were high and significant, compared to nonsignificant values obtained in two of three autumn comparisons. In the spring collection, parent-offspring regressions were negative regardless of testing temperature, suggesting that field females with a high fecundity produced offspring with low scores. Comparisons of F1 and F2 laboratory generations indicated intermediate heritabilities for fecundity in the laboratory. The lower bound heritability estimate for fecundity in field individuals was 37% in summer and 59% in autumn. Estimates of field heritability and evolvability for wing length measured in the spring collection were lower than in the laboratory. The results indicate that heritabilities and additive genetic variances for fecundity can be high in field-reared flies, but that results may vary between field collections.",1998,"Carla M SgrÃ², Ary A Hoffmann, Carla M SgrÃ², Ary A Hoffmann"
Interaction between Drosophila EGF receptor and vnd determines three dorsoventral domains of the neuroectoderm,9716528,,"Neurogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster starts by an ordered appearance of neuroblasts arranged in three columns (medial, intermediate and lateral) in each side of the neuroectoderm. Here we show that, in the intermediate column, the receptor tyrosine kinase DER represses expression of proneural genes, achaete and scute, and is required for the formation of neuroblasts. Most of the early function of DER is likely to be mediated by the Ras-MAP kinase signaling pathway, which is activated in the intermediate column, since a loss of a component of this pathway leads to a phenotype identical to that in DER mutants. MAP-kinase activation was also observed in the medial column where esg and proneural gene expression is unaffected by DER. We found that the homeobox gene vnd is required for the expression of esg and scute in the medial column, and show that vnd acts through the negative regulatory region of the esg enhancer that mediates the DER signal, suggesting the role of vnd is to counteract DER-dependent repression. Thus nested expression of vnd and the DER activator rhomboid is crucial to subdivide the neuroectoderm into the three dorsoventral domains.",1998,"Y Yagi, T Suzuki, S Hayashi, Y Yagi, T Suzuki, S Hayashi"
Immunological confirmation of elevated levels of CuZn superoxide dismutase protein in an artificially selected long-lived strain of Drosophila melanogaster,9615921,10.1016/s0531-5565(97)00095-8,"Oxidative stress-induced damage is a major causal factor leading to the loss of function characteristic of the aging process. Various antioxidant defenses are marshalled by the organism so as to combat this oxidative damage and delay the onset of senscence. CuZnSOD is one of the major antioxidant enzymes and has been shown to play an important role in the extended longevity of Drosophila melanogaster. Although assays exist with which to measure the CuZnSOD RNA prevalence and enzyme activity, there existed no antibodies that permitted the measurement of the actual amount of Drosophila enzyme protein present. Development of such a tool would enhance our ability to understand mechanisms of antioxidant gene expression in this organism. We have developed a polyclonal antibody against synthetic SOD peptides that is specific for Drosophila CuZnSOD as shown by Western blots. It is very sensitive when tested against native Drosophila CuZnSOD protein. Its use in our experimental system confirms the prior RNA and enzyme activity measurements that indicate that our genetically selected long-lived strain has significantly higher levels of CuZnSOD protein than does the appropriate control strain.",1998,"R Hari, V Burde, R Arking, R Hari, V Burde, R Arking"
How does offspring quality change with age in male Drosophila melanogaster?,9926621,10.1023/a:1021677804038,"We examined the relationship of genetic quality to age in male Drosophila melanogaster to test two contrasting hypotheses. The traditional hypothesis is that older males have proven their viability and therefore produce offspring of superior genetic quality. This hypothesis is often evoked as an explanation for female preference for older mates. In contrast, we have recently argued that older fathers may produce offspring of inferior genetic quality. Here, we present results from an experiment designed to measure the genetic quality of offspring produced by 2 day old, 2 week old and 5 week old male D. melanogaster. We found a statistically significant small reduction in larval viability and a similar but statistically non-significant reduction in son mating ability among the offspring of the 5 week old males. Daughter fecundity showed no apparent trend for a reduction nor an increase in performance with increasing age of the fathers. There was no evidence of a difference between the 2 day old and the 2 week old males for any of these three fitness components. These results are in somewhat better accordance with our alternative hypothesis, but the relatively weak and late occurring effects indicate that mate choice based on age may not be a viable strategy in this population.",1998,"D K Price, T F Hansen, D K Price, T F Hansen"
Sex-specific selection on time to remate in Drosophila melanogaster,9819344,10.1006/anbe.1998.0900,"Female Drosophila melanogaster were artificially selected for fast and slow time to remate (denoted 'high' and 'low' selection regimes, respectively). Both selection regimes and a control were replicated three times. Correlated responses to selection in females and in males were measured. A significant direct response to selection for time to remating was found in females from both selection regimes. Remating frequency of females showed a correlated response only in the females from the lines selected for faster time to remating. Time to first mating of virgin females showed no correlated response in either selection regime. No correlated response was found in males for time to remate, remating frequency or time to first mating of virgins, indicating that genetic correlations between the sexes do not influence the evolution of these traits in this population of D. melanogaster. There was no direct response to artificial selection for the ability of first males to deter females from remating. However, we found that the genotype of the first male to mate with a female could influence her time to remate; base stock males were better at deterring females from remating than were males from any of the selection lines.

Selection for longevity confers resistance to low-temperature stress in Drosophila melanogaster,9520911,10.1093/gerona/53a.2.b147,"One theory of the evolution of longevity says that improvement in life span is dependent on an increased ability to resist environmental stresses of all kind. Selective breeding of Drosophila melanogaster populations for longevity has demonstrably increased life span and also altered a number of other traits, such as resistance to starvation, desiccation, and ethanol fumes, and the ability to sustain longer flight. While the exact physiologic basis of some of these traits is not yet fully understood, at least some are known to derive from the properties of metabolic substrates of glycolysis. Improvement in those characters can depend partially, therefore, on altered stores of metabolites created from glycogen. Based on the known general relationship of some traits and the suspected basis in metabolism of others, we examine the possibility here that increased life span is accompanied by other traits that also confer physiologic resistance to stress. Specifically, we test the prediction that long-lived populations of fruit flies should be more resistant to low (prefreezing) and freezing temperature extremes. Both selected and control populations were found to be susceptible to prefreezing (1.5 degrees C) and freezing temperatures (0 degree C) here, but adults and pupae of the long-lived populations generally survived better in both situations, and at all durations of exposure. The resistance of individuals improved with acclimatization, but was superior in the long-lived populations whether thermal decline was rapid or stepwise. Cold resistant, long-lived populations also had significantly higher in vitro levels of glycerol, a cryoprotectant metabolite produced from glycogen. However, while adults and pupae of long-lived stocks were more resistant to cold, larvae of those stocks were more sensitive and survived relatively poorly at every length of exposure and acclimation. This surprising result implies that larvae maintain lower levels of cryoprotectant substances. Upon becoming pupae, however, stage-specific capabilities for environmental resistance and long life emerge. This conclusion agrees with a prior study of these stocks indicating that the uptake and use of nutrients in developing larvae are restricted in long-lived populations.",1998,"L S Luckinbill, L S Luckinbill"
Homologous chromosome pairing in Drosophila melanogaster proceeds through multiple independent initiations,9531544,10.1083/jcb.141.1.5,"The dynamics by which homologous chromosomes pair is currently unknown. Here, we use fluorescence in situ hybridization in combination with three-dimensional optical microscopy to show that homologous pairing of the somatic chromosome arm 2L in Drosophila occurs by independent initiation of pairing at discrete loci rather than by a processive zippering of sites along the length of chromosome. By evaluating the pairing frequencies of 11 loci on chromosome arm 2L over several timepoints during Drosophila embryonic development, we show that all 11 loci are paired very early in Drosophila development, within 13 h after egg deposition. To elucidate whether such pairing occurs by directed or undirected motion, we analyzed the pairing kinetics of histone loci during nuclear cycle 14. By measuring changes of nuclear length and correlating these changes with progression of time during cycle 14, we were able to express the pairing frequency and distance between homologous loci as a function of time. Comparing the experimentally determined dynamics of pairing to simulations based on previously proposed models of pairing motion, we show that the observed pairing kinetics are most consistent with a constrained random walk model and not consistent with a directed motion model. Thus, we conclude that simple random contacts through diffusion could suffice to allow pairing of homologous sites.",1998,"J C Fung, W F Marshall, A Dernburg, D A Agard, J W Sedat, J C Fung, W F Marshall, A Dernburg, D A Agard, J W Sedat"

Induction of mosaic sex-linked recessive lethals in the different germ cell stages of Drosophila melanogaster by bleomycin,9541653,10.1016/s0027-5107(97)00226-1,"The mutagenicity of bleomycin was studied in the different stages of spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Following the injection of 2 microliters of 0.1 micrograms/ml of the chemical into young wild-type males, complete and mosaic sex-linked recessive lethals were scored by the Muller-5 method in five successive broods, mainly representing the different stages of spermatogenesis. The delayed mutagenic effect of the chemical was measured by the proportion of mosaic progeny produced. The results showed that bleomycin significantly increased the proportions of both complete and mosaic lethals in the broods representing the meiotic and pre-meiotic stages, but did not show any significant increase in these proportions in the broods representing the sperms and spermatids. The sizes of the mutated areas in the F1 gonads represented by the proportions of lethal-bearing females in F2 mosaic cultures were small, indicating that the genetic instabilities induced by bleomycin were transformed into actual mutations in later zygotic divisions.

DNA supercoiling factor localizes to puffs on polytene chromosomes in Drosophila melanogaster,9774687,10.1128/mcb.18.11.6737,"DNA supercoiling factor (SCF) was first identified in silkworm as a protein that generates negative supercoils in DNA in conjunction with eukaryotic topoisomerase II. To analyze the in vivo role of the factor, we cloned a cDNA encoding Drosophila melanogaster SCF. Northern analysis revealed 1.6- and 1.8-kb mRNAs throughout development. The longer mRNA contains an open reading frame that shares homology with mouse reticulocalbin whereas the shorter one encodes a truncated version lacking the N-terminal signal peptide-like sequence. An antibody against SCF detected a 45-kDa protein in the cytoplasmic fraction and a 30-kDa protein in the nuclear fraction of embryonic extracts. Immunoprecipitation suggests that the 30-kDa protein interacts with topoisomerase II in the nucleus, and hence that it is a functional form of SCF. Immunostaining of blastoderm embryos showed that SCF is present in nuclei during interphase but is excluded from mitotic chromosomes. In larvae, the antibody stained the nuclei of several tissues including a posterior part of the salivary gland. This latter staining was associated with natural or ecdysteroid-induced puffs on polytene chromosomes. Upon heat treatment of larvae, the staining on the endogenous puffs disappeared, and strong staining appeared on heat shock puffs. These results implicate SCF in gene expression.",1998,"M Kobayashi, N Aita, S Hayashi, K Okada, T Ohta, S Hirose, M Kobayashi, N Aita, S Hayashi, K Okada, T Ohta, S Hirose"

While full-length mdg3 is present in all species phylogenetically closely related to D. melanogaster, the distribution of its deletion copy mdg3del was shown to be restricted only to D. melanogaster strains. mdg3del appeared to be amplified in two Drosophila cell lines of different origin. A ""generalized"" (statistically averaged) sequence of the shortened copy from a cell line Schneider2 was determined. The structure of this copy was shown to be the same as in the other tested strains of Drosophila. In addition to the major deletion involving the reverse transcriptase domain and a part of the ribonuclease H domain, several other deletions, insertions, and point substitutions were also revealed in shortened copies. The population of shortened copies was shown to result from the amplification of a single mdg3del copy in the genome of Schneider2 cells. The results obtained suggest that defective copies of the retrotransposon can be trans-mobilized in cultured cells and that the mechanisms of retroamplification in cell cultures and in an organism are different.",1998,"S N Avedisov, E S Zelentsova, Iu V Il'in"

"Sex-related genes, directional sexual selection, and speciation",9656489,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025994,"Reproductive isolation and speciation can result from the establishment of either premating or postmating barriers that restrict gene flow between populations. Recent studies of speciation have been dominated by a molecular approach to dissect the genetic basis of hybrid male sterility, a specific form of postmating reproductive isolation. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the evolution of genes involved in premating isolation and genes generally involved in other sex-related functions (e.g., mating behavior, fertilization, spermatogenesis, sex determination). We have assembled DNA sequences from 51 nuclear genes and classified them based on their functional characteristics. The proportion of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions were compared between Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila simulans, and Drosophila pseudoobscura, as well as between Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae. We found a high ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions for sex-related genes (i.e., genes involved in mating behavior, fertilization, spermatogenesis, or sex determination). The results suggest that directional sexual selection has shaped the evolution of sex-related genes and that these changes have more likely occurred during the early stages of speciation. It is possible that directional selection becomes relaxed after reproductive isolation has been completed between more distantly related species (e.g., D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura). However, a saturation in the number of nucleotide substitutions since the time of species separation may mask any sign of directional selection between more distantly related species.",1998,"A Civetta, R S Singh, A Civetta, R S Singh"

"Molecular cloning, genomic organization and developmental regulation of a novel receptor from Drosophila melanogaster structurally related to gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors for vertebrates",9731220,10.1006/bbrc.1998.9230,"After screening the data base of the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project with a sequence coding for the transmembrane region of a G protein-coupled receptor, we found that Drosophila might contain a gene coding for a receptor that is structurally related to the Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) receptors from vertebrates. Using the polymerase chain reaction, with Drosophila cDNA as a template, and oligonucleotide probes coding for the presumed exons of this gene, we were able to clone the cDNA coding for this receptor. The transmembrane region of the receptor shows 36% amino acid residue identity with the transmembrane region of the catfish and 31% amino acid residue identity with that of the rat GnRH receptor. The Drosophila receptor gene contains six introns, whereas the rat gene contains two: one intron in the Drosophila gene occurs at exactly the same position and has the same intron phasing as one intron in the rat gene, suggesting that the Drosophila and mammalian GnRH receptor genes are evolutionarily related. Northern blot analyses show that the Drosophila receptor gene is progressively expressed during larval development with a prominent maximum at the 3rd instar larval stage. Pupae contain low amounts of receptor mRNA, while adult flies contain higher levels, with males having about five times more receptor mRNA than females flies. Southern blot analyses show that Drosophila contains only one copy of the receptor gene, which is located at position 27A2-B1 of chromosome 2.

The transport activity observed following express of dEAAT in Xenopus oocytes or COS-7 cells shows a high affinity for L-glutamate, L-aspartate and D-aspartate, an absolute dependence on external sodium ions, and considerable stereoselectivity for the transport of L-glutamate over D-glutamate. As has been observed for the human carriers, EAAT 4 and EAAT 5, a significant component of the current activated by L-glutamate application to dEAAT-expressing oocytes appears to arise from the activation of a chloride channel associated with the carrier.",1998,"R P Seal, G M Daniels, W J Wolfgang, M A Forte, S G Amara, R P Seal, G M Daniels, W J Wolfgang, M A Forte, S G Amara"

Robust circadian rhythmicity of Drosophila melanogaster requires the presence of lateral neurons: a brain-behavioral study of disconnected mutants,9530835,10.1007/s003590050192,"Mutations at the disconnected (disco) locus of Drosophila melanogaster disrupt neural cell patterning in the visual system, leading to the loss of many optic lobe neurons. Drosophila's presumptive circadian pacemaker neurons--the dorsal and ventral lateral neurons--are usually among the missing cells, and most disco flies are behaviorally arrhythmic. In this study, I show that ventral lateral neurons (LNvs) are occasionally present and provoke robust circadian rhythmicity in disco mutants. Of 357 individual disco flies four animals with robust circadian rhythmicity were found. All four retained LNvs together with terminals in the superior protocerebrum. Residual or bi-circadian rhythmicity was found in about 20% of all flies; the remaining flies were completely arrhythmic. One of the flies with residual rhythmicity and two of the arrhythmic flies also had some LNvs stained. However, these flies lacked the LNv fibers in the superior protocerebrum. The results suggest that the presence of single LNvs is sufficient to provoke robust circadian rhythmicity in locomotor activity if the LNv terminals reach the superior protocerebrum. The presence of residual or bi-circadian rhythmicity in 20% of the flies without LNvs indicates that also other cells contribute to the rhythmic control of locomotor activity.",1998,"C Helfrich-FÃ¶rster, C Helfrich-FÃ¶rster"
Genomic organization of the segment polarity gene pan in Drosophila melanogaster,9613571,10.1007/s004380050705,"We previously described the molecular cloning of a mammalian T cell factor 1 (TCF-1)-like protein from Drosophila melanogaster, encoded by the pangolin (pan) locus, and demonstrated that it consists of a DNA binding domain similar to that of other high mobility group proteins and a protein-protein interaction domain that binds beta-catenin (Armadillo in Drosophila) but that it lacks a transcriptional activation domain.

Neurogenetic networks for startle-induced locomotion in Drosophila melanogaster,18713854,10.1073/pnas.0804889105,"Understanding how the genome empowers the nervous system to express behaviors remains a critical challenge in behavioral genetics. The startle response is an attractive behavioral model for studies on the relationship between genes, brain, and behavior, as the ability to respond rapidly to harmful changes in the environment is a universal survival trait. Drosophila melanogaster provides a powerful system in which genetic studies on individuals with controlled genetic backgrounds and reared under controlled environmental conditions can be combined with neuroanatomical studies to analyze behaviors. In a screen of 720 lines of D. melanogaster, carrying single P[GT1] transposon insertions, we found 267 lines that showed significant changes in startle-induced locomotor behavior. Excision of the transposon reversed this effect in five lines out of six tested. We infer that most of the 267 lines show mutant effects on startle-induced locomotion that are caused by the transposon insertions. We selected a subset of 15 insertions in the same genetic background in autosomal genes with strong mutant effects and crossed them to generate all 105 possible nonreciprocal double heterozygotes. These hybrids revealed an extensive network of epistatic interactions on the behavioral trait.

Methods and protocols for studying cell death in Drosophila,18603114,10.1016/S0076-6879(08)01602-9,"Drosophila melanogaster is a highly amenable model system for examining programmed cell death during animal development, offering sophisticated genetic techniques and in vivo cell biological analyses. The reproducible pattern of apoptosis, as well as the apoptotic response to genotoxic stress, has been well characterized during Drosophila development. The main cellular components required for cell death are highly conserved throughout evolution. Central to the regulation of apoptosis is the caspase family of cysteine proteases, and studies in Drosophila have revealed insights into their regulation and function. This chapter describes protocols for detecting apoptotic cells during Drosophila development, as well as the use of Drosophila cell lines. Commonly used methods for detecting apoptosis are described, including TUNEL, acridine orange, and immunostaining with specific components of the apoptotic pathway such as active caspases. A crucial step in the induction of apoptosis is caspase activation and cleavage, which can be measured by use of fluorogenic peptide substrates or detection of cleaved protein products by immunoblotting, respectively. In addition, one of the advantages of the use of Drosophila as model is the ability to examine genetic interactions with various components of the cell death pathway.",2008,"Donna Denton, Kathryn Mills, Sharad Kumar, Donna Denton, Kathryn Mills, Sharad Kumar"
The phospho-occupancy of an atypical SLIMB-binding site on PERIOD that is phosphorylated by DOUBLETIME controls the pace of the clock,18593878,10.1101/gad.1682708,"A common feature of animal circadian clocks is the progressive phosphorylation of PERIOD (PER) proteins, which is highly dependent on casein kinase Idelta/epsilon (CKIdelta/epsilon; termed DOUBLETIME [DBT] in Drosophila) and ultimately leads to the rapid degradation of hyperphosphorylated isoforms via a mechanism involving the F-box protein, beta-TrCP (SLIMB in Drosophila). Here we use the Drosophila melanogaster model system, and show that a key step in controlling the speed of the clock is phosphorylation of an N-terminal Ser (S47) by DBT, which collaborates with other nearby phosphorylated residues to generate a high-affinity atypical SLIMB-binding site on PER. DBT-dependent increases in the phospho-occupancy of S47 are temporally gated, dependent on the centrally located DBT docking site on PER and partially counterbalanced by protein phosphatase activity. We propose that the gradual DBT-mediated phosphorylation of a nonconsensus SLIMB-binding site establishes a temporal threshold for when in a daily cycle the majority of PER proteins are tagged for rapid degradation. Surprisingly, most of the hyperphosphorylation is unrelated to direct effects on PER stability. We also use mass spectrometry to map phosphorylation sites on PER, leading to the identification of a number of ""phospho-clusters"" that explain several of the classic per mutants.",2008,"Joanna C Chiu, Jens T Vanselow, Achim Kramer, Isaac Edery, Joanna C Chiu, Jens T Vanselow, Achim Kramer, Isaac Edery"
Axonal injury and regeneration in the adult brain of Drosophila,18524906,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0101-08.2008,"Drosophila melanogaster is a leading genetic model system in nervous system development and disease research. Using the power of fly genetics in traumatic axonal injury research will significantly speed up the characterization of molecular processes that control axonal regeneration in the CNS. We developed a versatile and physiologically robust preparation for the long-term culture of the whole Drosophila brain. We use this method to develop a novel Drosophila model for CNS axonal injury and regeneration. We first show that, similar to mammalian CNS axons, injured adult wild-type fly CNS axons fail to regenerate, whereas adult-specific enhancement of protein kinase A activity increases the regenerative capacity of lesioned neurons. Combined, these observations suggest conservation of neuronal regeneration mechanisms after injury. We next exploit this model to explore pathways that induce robust regeneration and find that adult-specific activation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase signaling is sufficient for de novo CNS axonal regeneration injury, including the growth of new axons past the lesion site and into the normal target area.",2008,"Derya Ayaz, Maarten Leyssen, Marta Koch, Jiekun Yan, Mohammed Srahna, Vasu Sheeba, Keri J Fogle, Todd C Holmes, Bassem A Hassan, Derya Ayaz, Maarten Leyssen, Marta Koch, Jiekun Yan, Mohammed Srahna, Vasu Sheeba, Keri J Fogle, Todd C Holmes, Bassem A Hassan"

Insights into substrate and product traffic in the Drosophila melanogaster acetylcholinesterase active site gorge by enlarging a back channel,18422651,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06413.x,"To test a product exit differing from the substrate entrance in the active site of acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7), we enlarged a channel located at the bottom of the active site gorge in the Drosophila enzyme. Mutation of Trp83 to Ala or Glu widens the channel from 5 A to 9 A. The kinetics of substrate hydrolysis and the effect of ligands that close the main entrance suggest that the mutations facilitate both product exit and substrate entrance. Thus, in the wild-type, the channel is so narrow that the 'back door' is used by at most 5% of the traffic, with the majority of traffic passing through the main entrance. In mutants Trp83Ala and Trp83Glu, ligands that close the main entrance do not inhibit substrate hydrolysis because the traffic can pass via an alternative route, presumably the enlarged back channel.",2008,"Florian Nachon, Jure Stojan, Didier Fournier, Florian Nachon, Jure Stojan, Didier Fournier"
Superoxide dismutase overexpression protects dopaminergic neurons in a Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease,18243716,10.1016/j.nbd.2007.11.013,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Some of the inherited forms of the disease are caused by mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene and the triplication of its locus. Oxidative stress has been proposed as a central mechanism for the progression of the disease although its relation with alpha-synuclein toxicity remains obscure. Targeted expression of human alpha-synuclein has been effectively used to recreate the pathology of PD in Drosophila melanogaster and it has been proved an excellent tool for the study of testable hypothesis in relation to the disease. We show that dopaminergic neurons are specifically sensitive to hyperoxia induced oxidative stress and that mutant forms of alpha-synuclein show an enhanced toxicity under these conditions suggesting synergic interactions.

Tre1 GPCR initiates germ cell transepithelial migration by regulating Drosophila melanogaster E-cadherin,18824569,10.1083/jcb.200807049,"Despite significant progress in identifying the guidance pathways that control cell migration, how a cell starts to move within an intact organism, acquires motility, and loses contact with its neighbors is poorly understood. We show that activation of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) trapped in endoderm 1 (Tre1) directs the redistribution of the G protein Gbeta as well as adherens junction proteins and Rho guanosine triphosphatase from the cell periphery to the lagging tail of germ cells at the onset of Drosophila melanogaster germ cell migration. Subsequently, Tre1 activity triggers germ cell dispersal and orients them toward the midgut for directed transepithelial migration. A transition toward invasive migration is also a prerequisite for metastasis formation, which often correlates with down-regulation of adhesion proteins. We show that uniform down-regulation of E-cadherin causes germ cell dispersal but is not sufficient for transepithelial migration in the absence of Tre1. Our findings therefore suggest a new mechanism for GPCR function that links cell polarity, modulation of cell adhesion, and invasion.",2008,"Prabhat S Kunwar, Hiroko Sano, Andrew D Renault, Vitor Barbosa, Naoyuki Fuse, Ruth Lehmann, Prabhat S Kunwar, Hiroko Sano, Andrew D Renault, Vitor Barbosa, Naoyuki Fuse, Ruth Lehmann"

Corona is required for higher-order assembly of transverse filaments into full-length synaptonemal complex in Drosophila oocytes,18802461,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000194,"The synaptonemal complex (SC) is an intricate structure that forms between homologous chromosomes early during the meiotic prophase, where it mediates homolog pairing interactions and promotes the formation of genetic exchanges. In Drosophila melanogaster, C(3)G protein forms the transverse filaments (TFs) of the SC. The N termini of C(3)G homodimers localize to the Central Element (CE) of the SC, while the C-termini of C(3)G connect the TFs to the chromosomes via associations with the axial elements/lateral elements (AEs/LEs) of the SC. Here, we show that the Drosophila protein Corona (CONA) co-localizes with C(3)G in a mutually dependent fashion and is required for the polymerization of C(3)G into mature thread-like structures, in the context both of paired homologous chromosomes and of C(3)G polycomplexes that lack AEs/LEs. Although AEs assemble in cona oocytes, they exhibit defects that are characteristic of c(3)G mutant oocytes, including failure of AE alignment and synapsis. These results demonstrate that CONA, which does not contain a coiled coil domain, is required for the stable 'zippering' of TFs to form the central region of the Drosophila SC. We speculate that CONA's role in SC formation may be similar to that of the mammalian CE proteins SYCE2 and TEX12. However, the observation that AE alignment and pairing occurs in Tex12 and Syce2 mutant meiocytes but not in cona oocytes suggests that the SC plays a more critical role in the stable association of homologs in Drosophila than it does in mammalian cells.",2008,"Scott L Page, Radhika S Khetani, Cathleen M Lake, Rachel J Nielsen, Jennifer K Jeffress, William D Warren, Sharon E Bickel, R Scott Hawley, Scott L Page, Radhika S Khetani, Cathleen M Lake, Rachel J Nielsen, Jennifer K Jeffress, William D Warren, Sharon E Bickel, R Scott Hawley"

We used the UAS-GAL4 expression system to drive expression of Hsp26 in the whole animal (ubiquitously), in the motoneurons, and in the muscles of wandering third-instar larvae. There were slight increases in time to crawling failure and normalized excitatory junction potential (EJP) area for some of the transgenic lines, but these were not consistent. In addition, Hsp26 had no effect on the temperature at failure of EJPs, normalized EJP peak amplitude, and normalized EJP half-width. Overexpression larvae had a similar number of motoneuronal boutons and length of nerve terminals as controls, indicating that the occasional protective effects on locomotion were not due to changes at the synapse. We conclude that overexpression had a small thermoprotective effect on locomotion and no effect on neural function.

DNA damage induced by industrial solid waste leachates in Drosophila melanogaster: a mechanistic approach,18240159,10.1002/em.20373,"Genomic stability requires that error-free genetic information be transmitted from generation to generation, a process that is dependent upon efficient DNA repair. Industrial leachates which contain mixtures of diverse chemicals are a major environmental concern. The interaction between these chemicals may have synergistic, antagonistic, or simply additive effects on biological systems. In the present study, the Comet assay was used to measure the DNA damage produced by leachates of solid wastes from flashlight battery, pigment, and tanning factories in the midgut cells and brain ganglia of Drosophila melanogaster mutants deficient in DNA repair proteins. Larvae were allowed to feed for 48 or 72 hr on diets containing 0.1, 0.5, and 2.0% (v/v) of the leachates. Physicochemical analysis run on the solid wastes, leachates, and treated larvae detected elevated levels of heavy metals. Leachates produced significantly greater levels of DNA damage in mutant strains mei41 (deficient in cell cycle check point protein), mus201 (deficient in excision repair protein), mus308 (deficient in postreplication repair protein), and rad54 (deficient in double strand break repair protein) than in the OregonR(+) wild-type strain. Larvae of the ligaseIV mutant (deficient in double strand break repair protein) were hypersensitive only to the pigment plant waste leachate. Conversely, the dnase2 mutant (deficient in protein responsible for degrading fragmented DNA) was more sensitive to DNA damage induction from the flashlight battery and tannery waste leachates. Our data demonstrate that repair of DNA damage in organisms exposed to leachates is dependent upon several DNA repair proteins, indicative of the involvement of multiple overlapping repair pathways.

Loss of p24 function in Drosophila melanogaster causes a stress response and increased levels of NF-kappaB-regulated gene products,18466616,10.1186/1471-2164-9-212,"Background:
      
    

    
      Secretory and transmembrane proteins traverse the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi compartments for final maturation prior to reaching their functional destinations. Members of the p24 protein family, which are transmembrane constituents of ER and Golgi-derived transport vesicles, function in trafficking some secretory proteins in yeast and higher eukaryotes. Yeast p24 mutants have minor secretory defects and induce an ER stress response that likely results from accumulation of proteins in the ER due to disrupted trafficking. We tested the hypothesis that loss of Drosophila melanogaster p24 protein function causes a transcriptional response characteristic of ER stress activation.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We performed genome-wide profiling experiments on tissues from Drosophila females with a mutation in the p24 gene logjam (loj) and identified changes in message levels for 641 genes. We found that loj mutants have expression profiles consistent with activation of stress responses. Of particular note is our observation that approximately 20% of the loci up regulated in loj mutants are Drosophila immune-regulated genes (DIRGs), many of which are transcriptional targets of NF-kappaB or JNK signaling pathways.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The loj mutant expression profiling data support the hypothesis that loss of p24 function causes a stress response. Genes involved in ameliorating stress, such as those encoding products involved in proteolysis, metabolism and protein folding, are differentially expressed in loj mutants compared to controls. Nearly 20% of the genes with increased message levels in the loj mutant are transcriptional targets of Drosophila NF-kappaB proteins. Activation of NF-kappaB transcription factors is the hallmark of an ER stress response called the ER overload response. Therefore, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that Drosophila p24 mutations induce stress, possibly via activation of ER stress response pathways. Because of the molecular and genetic tools available for Drosophila, the fly will be a useful system for investigating the tissue-specific functions of p24 proteins and for determining the how disrupting these molecules causes stress responses in vivo.",2008,"Kara A Boltz, Ginger E Carney, Kara A Boltz, Ginger E Carney"
"Dietary composition specifies consumption, obesity, and lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster",18485125,10.1111/j.1474-9726.2008.00400.x,"The inability to properly balance energy intake and expenditure with nutrient supply forms the basis for some of today's most pressing health issues, including diabetes and obesity. Mechanisms of nutrient homeostasis may also lie at the root of dietary restriction, a manipulation whereby reduced nutrient availability extends lifespan and ameliorates age-related deteriorations in many species. The traditional belief that the most important aspect of the diet is its energetic (i.e. caloric) content is currently under scrutiny. Hypotheses that focus on diet composition and highlight more subtle characteristics are beginning to emerge. Using Drosophila melanogaster, we asked whether diet composition alone, independent of its caloric content, was sufficient to impact behavior, physiology, and lifespan. We found that providing flies with a yeast-rich diet produced lean, reproductively competent animals with reduced feeding rates. Excess dietary sugar, on the other hand, promoted obesity, which was magnified during aging. Addition of dietary yeast often limited or reversed the phenotypic changes associated with increased dietary sugar and vice versa, and dietary imbalance was associated with reduced lifespan. Our data reveal that diet composition, alone and in combination with overall caloric intake, modulates lifespan, consumption, and fat deposition in flies, and they provide a useful foundation for dissecting the underlying genetic mechanisms that link specific nutrients with important aspects of general health and longevity.",2008,"Danielle A Skorupa, Azra Dervisefendic, Jessica Zwiener, Scott D Pletcher, Danielle A Skorupa, Azra Dervisefendic, Jessica Zwiener, Scott D Pletcher"
Green tea catechins and broccoli reduce fat-induced mortality in Drosophila melanogaster,17707629,10.1016/j.jnutbio.2007.05.009,"Dietary fat accelerates the ageing process and causes a greater mortality by accumulating lipid hydroperoxide (LPO) in Drosophila melanogaster. The present study found that the life span of D. melanogaster was shortened from 54 to 6 days in a dose-dependent manner when fat in diet increased from 0% to 25%. The results showed that supplementation of both green tea catechins (GTC) and broccoli extract (BE) reversed partially the fat-induced mortality. The maximum life span was 44 days for the control group fed with a 5% fat, whereas it increased to 50 and 59 days in the GTC- and BE-supplemented groups, respectively. The 50% survival time for the control flies fed with a 5% fat diet was 30 days. In contrast, it increased to 32 and 48 days when GTC and BE were supplemented in the diet. This was consistent with a significant reduction in total body LPO level in D. melanogaster maintained on the GTC- and BE-supplemented diet. Accordingly, catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities increased significantly in the flies fed with a GTC or a BE diet compared with those fed with a control 5% fat diet. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the increase in enzymatic activities of catalase and SOD was accompanied by up-regulation of genes for catalase, copper-zinc containing SOD and manganese-containing SOD.

The subunit gene encoded a 483-amino acid polypeptide that showed 84% sequence identity with DmRdl subunit (U02042) (Drosophila melanogaster resistant to dieldrin). When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, the subunit assembled as a functional homomeric complex activated by GABA and abamectin in a dose-dependent manner. The EC50 value of GABA was 0.49 mM (0.41-0.58) (n = 5). However, the responses to abamectin were very robust, with an EC50 of 4.85 microM (4.02-5.89) (n = 6), indicating that abamectin was > 100-fold more potent in activating chloride currents than GABA. The results suggest that this subunit is vital to the formation of a functional channel and contains the binding site of abamectin.",2008,"Xiao-Mao Zhou, Qing-Jun Wu, You-Jun Zhang, Lian-Yang Bai, Xiong-Ying Huang, Xiao-Mao Zhou, Qing-Jun Wu, You-Jun Zhang, Lian-Yang Bai, Xiong-Ying Huang"
"African morphology, behavior and phermones underlie incipient sexual isolation between us and Caribbean Drosophila melanogaster",18752599,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00488.x,"Understanding incipient sexual isolation and speciation is an important pursuit in evolutionary biology. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a useful model to address questions about the early stages of sexual isolation occurring within widespread species. This species exhibits sexual isolation between cosmopolitan and African flies, especially from Zimbabwe populations. In addition, we have recently described another example of partial sexual isolation between some US and Caribbean populations. This and other phenotypic data suggest that Caribbean flies might be segregating African traits. In the present work we study the geographical variation at the pheromone locus desaturase-2, as well as morphology and courtship behavior across the US-Caribbean region. We find that US and Caribbean populations show sharp geographical clines in all traits and demonstrate that Caribbean traits are more similar to those of Africa than to US populations. Further, African traits in the Caribbean are associated with sexual isolation and best explain variation in sexual isolation when all traits are considered together. These results imply that Caribbean mating preferences are likely to be based on African traits and that even at such early stages of sexual isolation, individuals may already cue in on several traits simultaneously during mate choice.",2008,"Roman Yukilevich, John R True, Roman Yukilevich, John R True"
Caffeine induction of Cyp6a2 and Cyp6a8 genes of Drosophila melanogaster is modulated by cAMP and D-JUN protein levels,18395996,10.1016/j.gene.2008.02.017,"Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases or CYPs, a family of endobiotics and xenobiotics metabolizing enzymes, are found in all organisms. We reported earlier that the promoters of Drosophila Cyp6a2 and Cyp6a8 genes are induced by caffeine. Since caffeine antagonizes adenosine receptor (AdoR) and inhibits cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE), we used luciferase reporter gene to examine whether in SL-2 cells and adult Drosophila, induction of the two Cyp6 genes is mediated via AdoR and/or PDE pathway. Results showed that AdoR is not involved because AdoR agonists or antagonists do not affect the Cyp6 promoter activities. However, inhibition of PDE by specific inhibitors including caffeine causes induction of both Cyp6 gene promoters. We also found that flies mutant for dunce gene coding for cAMP-PDE, have higher Cyp6a8 promoter activity than the wild-type flies. We demonstrate that caffeine treatment increases intracellular cAMP levels, and cAMP treatment induces the Cyp6 gene promoters. Since both Cyp6 genes have multiple sites for JUN transcription factors, which generally play a positive role in cAMP pathway, effect of Drosophila jun (D-jun) on the Cyp6a8 promoter activity was examined. Results showed that the expression of D-jun sense plasmid causes downregulation rather than activation of the Cyp6a8 promoter. Conversely, expression of antisense plasmid increased the promoter activity. Interestingly, caffeine treatment decreased the D-JUN protein level in SL-2 cells as well as in adult flies. These results suggest that D-jun acts as a negative regulator, and caffeine induction of Cyp6a8 and Cyp6a2 genes is mediated by the upregulation of cAMP pathway and downregulation of the D-JUN protein level.",2008,"Srividya Bhaskara, Mahesh B Chandrasekharan, Ranjan Ganguly, Srividya Bhaskara, Mahesh B Chandrasekharan, Ranjan Ganguly"
Proteomics reveals novel Drosophila seminal fluid proteins transferred at mating,18666829,10.1371/journal.pbio.0060178,"Across diverse taxa, seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) transferred at mating affect the reproductive success of both sexes. Such reproductive proteins often evolve under positive selection between species; because of this rapid divergence, Sfps are hypothesized to play a role in speciation by contributing to reproductive isolation between populations. In Drosophila, individual Sfps have been characterized and are known to alter male sperm competitive ability and female post-mating behavior, but a proteomic-scale view of the transferred Sfps has been missing. Here we describe a novel proteomic method that uses whole-organism isotopic labeling to detect transferred Sfps in mated female D. melanogaster. We identified 63 proteins, which were previously unknown to function in reproduction, and confirmed the transfer of dozens of predicted Sfps. Relative quantification of protein abundance revealed that several of these novel Sfps are abundant in seminal fluid. Positive selection and tandem gene duplication are the prevailing forces of Sfp evolution, and comparative proteomics with additional species revealed lineage-specific changes in seminal fluid content. We also report a proteomic-based gene discovery method that uncovered 19 previously unannotated genes in D. melanogaster. Our results demonstrate an experimental method to identify transferred proteins in any system that is amenable to isotopic labeling, and they underscore the power of combining proteomic and evolutionary analyses to shed light on the complex process of Drosophila reproduction.",2008,"Geoffrey D Findlay, Xianhua Yi, Michael J Maccoss, Willie J Swanson, Geoffrey D Findlay, Xianhua Yi, Michael J Maccoss, Willie J Swanson"
Klumpfuss is involved in the determination of sensory organ precursors in Drosophila,18831969,10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.08.031,"The neural precursor cells (sensory organ precursor cell (SOP)) of the external sense organs of Drosophila melanogaster arise from proneural clusters, which are defined through the expression pattern of proneural genes such as the genes of the achaete-scute complex (AS-C). The activities of these genes enable each cell within a cluster to become the SOP. A selection process mediated by the Notch signalling pathway and Extramacrochaetae selects a defined number of cells within the proneural cluster to realise the SOP fate, while it redirects the rest to the epidermoblast fate. Here we report a new function required for SOP determination mediated by the zinc finger transcription factor Klumpfuss (Klu). Klu participates in a novel mechanism that appears to regulate the expression as well as the activity of the proneural proteins. Our analysis indicates that Klu is a repressor of transcription, which acts via a double-negative loop to promote SOP formation: it suppresses the expression of an unidentified antagonist of proneural activity. We present a detailed structure function analysis that identifies functionally important domains within Klu.",2008,"Markus Kaspar, Markus Schneider, William Chia, Thomas Klein, Markus Kaspar, Markus Schneider, William Chia, Thomas Klein"

Overall, mitochondrial transport kinetics in larval motor axons appeared similar among all three solutions. Unexpectedly, HL3 solution selectively increased the length of mitochondria in the context of the net-direction of transport. We also found that mitochondrial transport is sensitive to the extracellular Ca(2+) but not glutamate concentration.

"Telomeric trans-silencing in Drosophila melanogaster: tissue specificity, development and functional interactions between non-homologous telomeres",18813361,10.1371/journal.pone.0003249,"Background:
      
    

    
      The study of P element repression in Drosophila melanogaster led to the discovery of the telomeric Trans-Silencing Effect (TSE), a homology-dependent repression mechanism by which a P-transgene inserted in subtelomeric heterochromatin (Telomeric Associated Sequences, ""TAS"") has the capacity to repress in trans, in the female germline, a homologous P-lacZ transgene located in euchromatin. TSE can show variegation in ovaries, displays a maternal effect as well as an epigenetic transmission through meiosis and involves heterochromatin and RNA silencing pathways.
    

    
  


        Principal findings:
      
    

    
      Here, we analyze phenotypic and genetic properties of TSE. We report that TSE does not occur in the soma at the adult stage, but appears restricted to the female germline. It is detectable during development at the third instar larvae where it presents the same tissue specificity and maternal effect as in adults. Transgenes located in TAS at the telomeres of the main chromosomes can be silencers which in each case show the maternal effect. Silencers located at non-homologous telomeres functionally interact since they stimulate each other via the maternally-transmitted component. All germinally-expressed euchromatic transgenes tested, located on all major chromosomes, were found to be repressed by a telomeric silencer: thus we detected no TSE escaper. The presence of the euchromatic target transgene is not necessary to establish the maternal inheritance of TSE, responsible for its epigenetic behavior. A single telomeric silencer locus can simultaneously repress two P-lacZ targets located on different chromosomal arms.
    

    
  


        Conclusions and significance:
      
    

    
      Therefore TSE appears to be a widespread phenomenon which can involve different telomeres and work across the genome. It can explain the P cytotype establishment by telomeric P elements in natural Drosophila populations.",2008,"Thibaut Josse, Corinne Maurel-Zaffran, Augustin de Vanssay, Laure Teysset, Anne-Laure Todeschini, Valerie Delmarre, Nicole Chaminade, Dominique AnxolabÃ©hÃ¨re, StÃ©phane Ronsseray, Thibaut Josse, Corinne Maurel-Zaffran, Augustin de Vanssay, Laure Teysset, Anne-Laure Todeschini, Valerie Delmarre, Nicole Chaminade, Dominique AnxolabÃ©hÃ¨re, StÃ©phane Ronsseray"
"The Drosophila homolog of human tumor suppressor TSC-22 promotes cellular growth, proliferation, and survival",18375761,10.1073/pnas.0800945105,"TSC22D1, which encodes transforming growth factor beta-stimulated clone 22 (TSC-22), is thought to be a tumor suppressor because its expression is lost in many glioblastoma, salivary gland, and prostate cancers. TSC-22 is the founding member of the TSC-22/DIP/Bun family of leucine zipper transcription factors; its functions have not been investigated in a multicellular environment. Genetic studies in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster often provide fundamental insights into mechanisms disrupted in carcinogenesis, because of the strong evolutionary conservation of molecular mechanisms between flies and humans. Whereas humans and mice have four TSC-22 domain genes with numerous isoforms, Drosophila has only one TSC-22 domain gene, bunched (bun), which encodes both large and small protein isoforms. Surprisingly, Drosophila Bun proteins promote cellular growth and proliferation in ovarian follicle cells. Loss of both large isoforms has the strongest phenotypes, including increased apoptosis. Cultured S2 cells depleted for large Bun isoforms show increased apoptosis and less frequent cell division, with decreased cell size. Altogether, these data indicate that Drosophila TSC-22/DIP/Bun proteins are necessary for cellular growth, proliferation, and survival both in culture and in an epithelial context. Previous work demonstrated that bun prevents recruitment of epithelial cells to a migratory fate and, thus, maintains epithelial organization. We speculate that reduced TSC22D1 expression generally reduces cellular fitness and only contributes to carcinogenesis in specific tissue environments.",2008,"Xiaodong Wu, Megumu Yamada-Mabuchi, Erick J Morris, Pradeep Singh Tanwar, Leonard Dobens, Silvia Gluderer, Sabina Khan, Jing Cao, Hugo Stocker, Ernst Hafen, Nick J Dyson, Laurel A Raftery, Xiaodong Wu, Megumu Yamada-Mabuchi, Erick J Morris, Pradeep Singh Tanwar, Leonard Dobens, Silvia Gluderer, Sabina Khan, Jing Cao, Hugo Stocker, Ernst Hafen, Nick J Dyson, Laurel A Raftery"

Experimental Introgression To Evaluate the Impact of Sex Specific Traits on Drosophila melanogaster Incipient Speciation,31167833,10.1534/g3.119.400385,"Sex specific traits are involved in speciation but it is difficult to determine whether their variation initiates or reinforces sexual isolation. In some insects, speciation depends of the rapid change of expression in desaturase genes coding for sex pheromones. Two closely related desaturase genes are involved in Drosophila melanogaster pheromonal communication: desat1 affects both the production and the reception of sex pheromones while desat2 is involved in their production in flies of Zimbabwe populations. There is a strong asymmetric sexual isolation between Zimbabwe populations and all other ""Cosmopolitan"" populations: Zimbabwe females rarely copulate with Cosmopolitan males whereas Zimbabwe males readily copulate with all females. All populations express desat1 but only Zimbabwe strains show high desat2 expression. To evaluate the impact of sex pheromones, female receptivity and desat expression on the incipient speciation process between Zimbabwe and Cosmopolitan populations, we introgressed the Zimbabwe genome into a Cosmopolitan genome labeled with the white mutation, using a multi-generation procedure. The association between these sex-specific traits was determined during the procedure. The production of pheromones was largely dissociated between the sexes. The copulation frequency (but not latency) was highly correlated with the female-but not with the male-principal pheromones. We finally obtained two stable white lines showing Zimbabwe-like sex pheromones, copulation discrimination and desat expression.

Analysis of germline substitutions suggests that spermatogenesis is a highly reparative process, with the mutational load of germ cells decreasing as spermatogenesis progresses.

"Drosophila mRNA Localization During Later Development: Past, Present, and Future",30899273,10.3389/fgene.2019.00135,"Multiple mechanisms tightly regulate mRNAs during their transcription, translation, and degradation. Of these, the physical localization of mRNAs to specific cytoplasmic regions is relatively easy to detect; however, linking localization to functional regulatory roles has been more difficult to establish. Historically, Drosophila melanogaster is a highly effective model to identify localized mRNAs and has helped identify roles for this process by regulating various cell activities. The majority of the well-characterized functional roles for localizing mRNAs to sub-regions of the cytoplasm have come from the Drosophila oocyte and early syncytial embryo. At present, relatively few functional roles have been established for mRNA localization within the relatively smaller, differentiated somatic cell lineages characteristic of later development, beginning with the cellular blastoderm, and the multiple cell lineages that make up the gastrulating embryo, larva, and adult. This review is divided into three parts-the first outlines past evidence for cytoplasmic mRNA localization affecting aspects of cellular activity post-blastoderm development in Drosophila. The majority of these known examples come from highly polarized cell lineages such as differentiating neurons. The second part considers the present state of affairs where we now know that many, if not most mRNAs are localized to discrete cytoplasmic regions in one or more somatic cell lineages of cellularized embryos, larvae or adults. Assuming that the phenomenon of cytoplasmic mRNA localization represents an underlying functional activity, and correlation with the encoded proteins suggests that mRNA localization is involved in far more than neuronal differentiation. Thus, it seems highly likely that past-identified examples represent only a small fraction of localization-based mRNA regulation in somatic cells. The last part highlights recent technological advances that now provide an opportunity for probing the role of mRNA localization in Drosophila, moving beyond cataloging the diversity of localized mRNAs to a similar understanding of how localization affects mRNA activity.",2019,"Sarah C Hughes, Andrew J Simmonds, Sarah C Hughes, Andrew J Simmonds"
Learning a Spatial Task by Trial and Error in Drosophila,31327716,10.1016/j.cub.2019.06.045,"The ability to use memory to return to specific locations for foraging is advantageous for survival. Although recent reports have demonstrated that the fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster are capable of visual cue-driven place learning and idiothetic path integration [1-4], the depth and flexibility of Drosophila's ability to solve spatial tasks and the underlying neural substrate and genetic basis have not been extensively explored. Here, we show that Drosophila can remember a reward-baited location through reinforcement learning and do so quickly and without requiring vision. After gaining genetic access to neurons (through 0273-GAL4) with properties reminiscent of the vertebrate medial forebrain bundle (MFB) and developing a high-throughput closed-loop stimulation system, we found that both sighted and blind flies can learn-by trial and error-to repeatedly return to an unmarked location (in a rectangularly shaped arena) where a brief stimulation of the 0273-GAL4 neurons was available for each visit. We found that optogenetic stimulation of these neurons enabled learning by employing both a cholinergic pathway that promoted self-stimulation and a dopaminergic pathway that likely promoted association of relevant cues with reward.

Pathogenic fungi-induced susceptibility is mitigated by mutual Lactobacillus plantarum in the Drosophila melanogaster model,31864308,10.1186/s12866-019-1686-1,"Background:
      
    

    
      Since animals frequently encounter a variety of harmful fungi in nature, their ability to develop sophisticated anti-fungal strategies allows them to flourish across the globe. Extensive studies have highlighted the significant involvement of indigenous microbial communities in human health. However, the daunting diversity of mammalian microbiota and host genetic complexity are major obstacles to our understanding of these intricate links between microbiota components, host immune genotype, and disease phenotype. In this study, we sought to develop a bacterium-fungus-Drosophila model to systematically evaluate the anti-fungal effects of commensal bacteria.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We isolated the pathogenic fungal strain, Diaporthe FY, which was detrimental to the survival and development of Drosophila upon infection. Using Drosophila as a model system, Drosophila-associated Lactobacillus plantarum functioned as a probiotic, and protected the flies from mortality induced by Diaporthe FY. Our results show that L. plantarum hindered the growth of Diaporthe FY in vitro, and decreased the mortality rate of Diaporthe FY-infected flies in vivo, consequently mitigating the toxicity of Diaporthe FY to the hosts. Additionally, the presence of L. plantarum overrode the avoidance of oviposition on Diaporthe FY-associated substrates.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Diaporthe FY was identified as a potential Drosophila pathogen. Commensal L. plantarum mitigated the susceptibility of Drosophila to pathogenic fungi, providing insight into the natural interplay between commensal and pathogenic microbial communities that contribute to animal health and pathogenesis.",2019,"Wanzhen Su, Jialin Liu, Peng Bai, Baocang Ma, Wei Liu, Wanzhen Su, Jialin Liu, Peng Bai, Baocang Ma, Wei Liu"

In recent years, the nutritional sensor O-GlcNAcylation has been recognized as a key regulator of chromatin remodeling. In this review, we summarize and discuss recent clues that OGT and O-GlcNAcylation intimately regulate the functions of the Polycomb group proteins at different levels especially during Drosophila melanogaster embryonic development and in human cancer cell lines.

Molecular sensor of nicotine in taste of Drosophila melanogaster,31226410,10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.103178,"Nicotine is an alkaloid and potent parasympathomimetic stimulant found in the leaves of many plants including Nicotiana tabacum, which functions as an anti-herbivore chemical and an insecticide. Chemoreceptors embedded in the gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) enable animals to judge the quality of bitter compounds and respond to them. Various taste receptors such as gustatory receptors (GRs), ionotropic receptors (IRs), transient receptor potential channels (TRPs), and pickpocket channels (PPKs) have been shown to have important roles in taste sensation. However, the mechanism underlying nicotine taste sensation has not been resolved in the insect model. Here we identify molecular receptors to detect the taste of nicotine and provide electrophysiological and behavioral evidence that gustatory receptors are required for avoiding nicotine-laced foods. Our results demonstrate that gustatory receptors are reasonable targets to develop new pesticides that maximize the insecticidal effects of nicotine.",2019,"Suman Rimal, Youngseok Lee, Suman Rimal, Youngseok Lee"
Recent advances in the neural regulation of feeding behavior in adult Drosophila,31168968,10.1631/jzus.B1900080,"The ability to maintain metabolic homeostasis is a key capability critical for the survival and well-being of animals living in constantly changing environments. Metabolic homeostasis depends on neuromodulators, such as biogenic amines, neuropeptides, and hormones, to signal changes in animals' internal metabolic status and to orchestrate their behaviors accordingly. An important example is the regulation of feeding behavior by conserved molecular and cellular mechanisms across the animal kingdom. Its relatively simple brain coupled with well-characterized genetics and behavioral paradigms makes the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster an excellent model for investigating the neuromodulatory regulation of feeding behavior. In this review we discuss the neuromodulators and neural circuits that integrate the internal physiological status with external sensory cues and modulate feeding behavior in adult fruit flies. Studies show that various specific aspects of feeding behavior are subjected to unique neuromodulatory regulation, which permits fruit flies to maintain metabolic homeostasis effectively.",2019,"Gao-Hang Wang, Li-Ming Wang, Gao-Hang Wang, Li-Ming Wang"
Independent effects on cellular and humoral immune responses underlie genotype-by-genotype interactions between Drosophila and parasitoids,31589659,10.1371/journal.ppat.1008084,"It is common to find abundant genetic variation in host resistance and parasite infectivity within populations, with the outcome of infection frequently depending on genotype-specific interactions. Underlying these effects are complex immune defenses that are under the control of both host and parasite genes. We have found extensive variation in Drosophila melanogaster's immune response against the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi. Some aspects of the immune response, such as phenoloxidase activity, are predominantly affected by the host genotype. Some, such as upregulation of the complement-like protein Tep1, are controlled by the parasite genotype. Others, like the differentiation of immune cells called lamellocytes, depend on the specific combination of host and parasite genotypes. These observations illustrate how the outcome of infection depends on independent genetic effects on different aspects of host immunity. As parasite-killing results from the concerted action of different components of the immune response, these observations provide a physiological mechanism to generate phenomena like epistasis and genotype-interactions that underlie models of coevolution.",2019,"Alexandre B LeitÃ£o, Xueni Bian, Jonathan P Day, Simone Pitton, E?ref Demir, Francis M Jiggins, Alexandre B LeitÃ£o, Xueni Bian, Jonathan P Day, Simone Pitton, E?ref Demir, Francis M Jiggins"
Larvae of Drosophila melanogaster exhibit transcriptional activation of immune response pathways and antimicrobial peptides during recovery from supercooling stress,30660665,10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.01.006,"The biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying insect cold acclimation prior to cold stress are relatively well explored, but the mechanisms linked to recovery and repair after cold stress have received much less attention. Here we focus on recovery from cold stress in the larvae of the vinegar fly (Drosophila melanogaster) that were exposed to two physiologically distinct cold stress situations: supercooling (S, survival > 95%) and freezing (F, survival < 10%), both at -5 Â°C. We analysed the metabolic and transcriptomic responses to cold stress via GC-MS/LC-MS and whole-genome microarrays, respectively. Both stresses (S and F) caused metabolic perturbations which were transient in supercooled larvae but deeper and irreversible in frozen larvae. Differential gene expression analysis revealed a clear disparity in responses to supercooling and freezing (less than 10% of DE genes overlapped between S and F larvae). Using GO term enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway mapping, we identified the stimulation of immune response pathways as a strong candidate mechanism for coping with supercooling. Supercooling caused complex transcriptional activation of innate immunity potential: from Lysozyme-mediated degradation of bacterial cell walls, recognition of pathogen signals, through phagocytosis and lysosomal degradation, Toll and Imd signaling, to upregulation of genes coding for different antimicrobial peptides. The transcriptomic response to freezing was instead dominated by degradation of macromolecules and death-related processes such as autophagy and apoptosis. Of the 45 upregulated DE genes overlapping in responses to supercooling and freezing, 26 were broadly ascribable to defense and repair functions.",2019,"TomÃ¡Å¡ ?t?tina, Rodolphe Poupardin, Martin Moos, Petr ?imek, Petr ?milauer, VladimÃ­r KoÅ¡tÃ¡l, TomÃ¡Å¡ ?t?tina, Rodolphe Poupardin, Martin Moos, Petr ?imek, Petr ?milauer, VladimÃ­r KoÅ¡tÃ¡l"
Starvation tolerance associated with prolonged sleep bouts upon starvation in a single natural population of Drosophila melanogaster,31381200,10.1111/jeb.13514,"Large genetic variations in starvation tolerance in animals indicate that there are multiple strategies to cope with low-nutrient conditions. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) typically respond to starvation by suppressing sleep and enhancing locomotor activity presumably to search for food. However, we hypothesized that in a natural population, there are costs and benefits to sleep suppression under low-nutrient conditions and that conserving energy through sleep could be a better strategy depending on food availability. In this study, we quantified the variation in sleep-related traits in 21 wild-derived inbred lines from Katsunuma, Japan, under fed and starved conditions and analysed the relationship between those traits and starvation tolerance. Although most of the lines responded to starvation by suppressing the total time in sleep, there were indeed two lines that responded by significantly increasing the sleep-bout durations and thus not reducing the total time in sleep. These genotypes survived longer in acute starvation conditions compared to genotypes that responded by the immediate suppression of sleep, which could be due to the reduced metabolic rate during the long uninterrupted sleep bouts. The coexistence of the enhanced foraging and resting strategies upon starvation within a single population is consistent with the presence of a behavioural trade-off between food search and energy conservation due to unpredictable food availability in nature. These results provide insights into the evolutionary mechanisms that contribute to the maintenance of genetic variations underlying environmental stress resistance.",2019,"Mai Miura, Aya Takahashi, Mai Miura, Aya Takahashi"
Vibrio parahaemolyticus VopA Is a Potent Inhibitor of Cell Migration and Apoptosis in the Intestinal Epithelium of Drosophila melanogaster,30617204,10.1128/IAI.00669-18,"Animal models have played a key role in providing an understanding of the mechanisms that govern the pathophysiology of intestinal diseases. To expand on the repertoire of organisms available to study enteric diseases, we report on the use of the Drosophila melanogaster model to identify a novel function of an effector protein secreted by Vibrio parahaemolyticus, which is an enteric pathogen found in contaminated seafood. During pathogenesis, V. parahaemolyticus secretes effector proteins that usurp the host's innate immune signaling pathways, thus allowing the bacterium to evade detection by the innate immune system. One secreted effector protein, VopA, has potent inhibitory effects on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways via the acetylation of critical residues within the catalytic loops of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs). Using the Drosophila model and cultured mammalian cells, we show that VopA also has potent modulating activity on focal adhesion complex (FAC) proteins, where VopA markedly reduced the levels of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation at Ser910, whereas the phosphorylation levels of FAK at Tyr397 and Tyr861 were markedly increased. Cultured cells expressing VopA were also impaired in their ability to migrate and repopulate areas subjected to a scratch wound. Consistently, expression of VopA in Drosophila midgut enterocytes disrupted the normal enterocyte arrangement. Finally, VopA inhibited apoptosis in both Drosophila tissues and mammalian cultured cells. Together, our data show that VopA can alter normal intestinal homeostatic processes to facilitate opportunities for V. parahaemolyticus to prolong infection within the host.",2019,"Liping Luo, Jason D Matthews, Brian S Robinson, Rheinallt M Jones, Liping Luo, Jason D Matthews, Brian S Robinson, Rheinallt M Jones"
A small number of cholinergic neurons mediate hyperaggression in female Drosophila,31391301,10.1073/pnas.1907042116,"In the Drosophila model of aggression, males and females fight in same-sex pairings, but a wide disparity exists in the levels of aggression displayed by the 2 sexes. A screen of Drosophila Flylight Gal4 lines by driving expression of the gene coding for the temperature sensitive dTRPA1 channel, yielded a single line (GMR26E01-Gal4) displaying greatly enhanced aggression when thermoactivated. Targeted neurons were widely distributed throughout male and female nervous systems, but the enhanced aggression was seen only in females. No effects were seen on female mating behavior, general arousal, or male aggression. We quantified the enhancement by measuring fight patterns characteristic of female and male aggression and confirmed that the effect was female-specific. To reduce the numbers of neurons involved, we used an intersectional approach with our library of enhancer trap flp-recombinase lines. Several crosses reduced the populations of labeled neurons, but only 1 cross yielded a large reduction while maintaining the phenotype. Of particular interest was a small group (2 to 4 pairs) of neurons in the approximate position of the pC1 cluster important in governing male and female social behavior. Female brains have approximately 20 doublesex (dsx)-expressing neurons within pC1 clusters. Using dsx FLP instead of 357 FLP for the intersectional studies, we found that the same 2 to 4 pairs of neurons likely were identified with both. These neurons were cholinergic and showed no immunostaining for other transmitter compounds.

Opposite effects of Drosophila C3PO on gene silencing mediated by esi-2.1 and miRNA-bantam,30576408,10.1093/abbs/gmy154,"Translin/TRAX complex, also named as C3PO, is evolutionarily conserved and participates in diverse cellular processes in different organisms from yeast to human. C3PO plays a critical role in the activation of RNA-induced silencing complexes by promoting the unwinding and degradation of passenger strand of exogenous siRNAs (exo-siRNAs) in Drosophila and human. Moreover, human C3PO (hC3PO) has been found to broadly repress miRNAs by degrading miRNA precursors. However, the effect of Drosophila melanogaster C3PO (dmC3PO) on endogenous siRNA (endo-siRNA) and miRNA pathways remains unknown. Here, we found that the loss of dmC3PO promoted the accumulation of the passenger strand of esi-2.1 (hp-CG4068B), and resulted in the de-repression of the DNA-damage-response gene mutagensensitive 308 (mus308), which is an endogenous slicer target of esi-2.1 in Drosophila. Moreover, we also found that depletion of dmC3PO increased the accumulation of miR-bantam. Taken together, our findings indicated that dmC3PO not only involves in siRNA pathway triggered by dsRNA, but also regulates the abundance of certain endogenous small RNAs in Drosophila.",2019,"Yujie Liu, Yuan Fang, Yongxiang Liu, Zhaowei Wang, Bao Lyu, Yuanyang Hu, Xi Zhou, Yujie Liu, Yuan Fang, Yongxiang Liu, Zhaowei Wang, Bao Lyu, Yuanyang Hu, Xi Zhou"

Visuomotor strategies for object approach and aversion in Drosophila melanogaster,30559298,10.1242/jeb.193730,"Animals classify stimuli to generate appropriate motor actions. In flight, Drosophila melanogaster classify equidistant large and small objects with categorically different behaviors: a tall object evokes approach whereas a small object elicits avoidance. We studied visuomotor behavior in rigidly and magnetically tethered D. melanogaster to reveal strategies that generate aversion to a small object. We discovered that small-object aversion in tethered flight is enabled by aversive saccades and smooth movement, which vary with the stimulus type. Aversive saccades in response to a short bar had different dynamics from approach saccades in response to a tall bar and the distribution of pre-saccade error angles was more stochastic for a short bar. Taken together, we show that aversive responses in D. melanogaster are driven in part by processes that elicit signed saccades with distinct dynamics and trigger mechanisms.

Peptidergic signaling from clock neurons regulates reproductive dormancy in Drosophila melanogaster,31194738,10.1371/journal.pgen.1008158,"With the approach of winter, many insects switch to an alternative protective developmental program called diapause. Drosophila melanogaster females overwinter as adults by inducing a reproductive arrest that is characterized by inhibition of ovarian development at previtellogenic stages. The insulin producing cells (IPCs) are key regulators of this process, since they produce and release insulin-like peptides that act as diapause-antagonizing hormones. Here we show that in D. melanogaster two neuropeptides, Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF) and short Neuropeptide F (sNPF) inhibit reproductive arrest, likely through modulation of the IPCs. In particular, genetic manipulations of the PDF-expressing neurons, which include the sNPF-producing small ventral Lateral Neurons (s-LNvs), modulated the levels of reproductive dormancy, suggesting the involvement of both neuropeptides. We expressed a genetically encoded cAMP sensor in the IPCs and challenged brain explants with synthetic PDF and sNPF. Bath applications of both neuropeptides increased cAMP levels in the IPCs, even more so when they were applied together, suggesting a synergistic effect. Bath application of sNPF additionally increased Ca2+ levels in the IPCs.

Short-Term Memory Deficits in the SLEEP Inbred Panel,32596662,10.3390/clockssleep1040036,"Although sleep is heritable and conserved across species, sleep duration varies from individual to individual. A shared genetic architecture between sleep duration and other evolutionarily important traits could explain this variability. Learning and memory are critical traits sharing a genetic architecture with sleep. We wanted to know whether learning and memory would be altered in extreme long or short sleepers. We therefore assessed the short-term learning and memory ability of flies from the Sleep Inbred Panel (SIP), a collection of 39 extreme long- and short-sleeping inbred lines of Drosophila. Neither long nor short sleepers had appreciable learning, in contrast to a moderate-sleeping control. We also examined the response of long and short sleepers to enriched social conditions, a paradigm previously shown to induce morphological changes in the brain. While moderate-sleeping control flies had increased daytime sleep and quantifiable increases in brain structures under enriched social conditions, flies of the Sleep Inbred Panel did not display these changes.

The first method uses three microelectrodes to measure the specific transepithelial resistance normalized to tubule length or luminal surface area for comparison with resistances of other epithelia. The second method uses only two microelectrodes to measure the relative resistance for comparing before and after effects in a single Malpighian tubule. Knowledge of the specific transepithelial resistance allows the first electrical model of electrolyte secretion by the main segment of the anterior Malpighian tubule of D . melanogaster The electrical model is remarkably similar to that of the distal Malpighian tubule of Aedes aegypti when tubules of Drosophila and Aedes are studied in vitro under the same experimental conditions.

Optimal searching behaviour generated intrinsically by the central pattern generator for locomotion,31674911,10.7554/eLife.50316,"Efficient searching for resources such as food by animals is key to their survival. It has been proposed that diverse animals from insects to sharks and humans adopt searching patterns that resemble a simple LÃ©vy random walk, which is theoretically optimal for 'blind foragers' to locate sparse, patchy resources. To test if such patterns are generated intrinsically, or arise via environmental interactions, we tracked free-moving Drosophila larvae with (and without) blocked synaptic activity in the brain, suboesophageal ganglion (SOG) and sensory neurons. In brain-blocked larvae, we found that extended substrate exploration emerges as multi-scale movement paths similar to truncated LÃ©vy walks. Strikingly, power-law exponents of brain/SOG/sensory-blocked larvae averaged 1.96, close to a theoretical optimum (Âµ ??2.0) for locating sparse resources.

Some elements are able to transpose in somatic cells, a process known as somatic transposition (ST), which has been associated with detrimental biological effects. The mariner-Mos1 element of Drosophila promotes transposition in somatic and germline cells and is an excellent model for studies related to the biological consequence of somatic excision (SE). In this work, we used temperature stress to induce increasing transposition of mariner-Mos1 during different stages of the development of D. simulans, aiming to quantify SE during lifespan. Furthermore, strains of D. melanogaster exhibiting differential expression of mariner-Mos1 were employed for estimating some biological consequences of mariner mobilization. It is shown that SE of mariner-Mos1 was not constant during development; the larval phase had the highest rates while the pupal stage exhibited lower rates, and in the embryonic stage, no difference was detected. SE can be detrimental, as suggested by correlation in SE level and reduction in behavioral activities and embryonic viability.

The indispensable contribution of s38 protein to ovarian-eggshell morphogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,30382186,10.1038/s41598-018-34532-2,"Drosophila chorion represents a remarkable model system for the in vivo study of complex extracellular-matrix architectures. For its organization and structure, s38 protein is considered as a component of major importance, since it is synthesized and secreted during early choriogenesis. However, there is no evidence that proves its essential, or redundant, role in chorion biogenesis. Hence, we show that targeted downregulation of s38 protein, specifically in the ovarian follicle-cell compartment, via employment of an RNAi-mediated strategy, causes generation of diverse dysmorphic phenotypes, regarding eggshell's regionally and radially specialized structures. Downregulation of s38 protein severely impairs fly's fertility and is unable to be compensated by the s36 homologous family member, thus unveiling s38 protein's essential contribution to chorion's assembly and function. Altogether, s38 acts as a key skeletal protein being critically implicated in the patterning establishment of a highly structured tripartite endochorion.

We transformed either the D. pseudoobscura per or tim transgenes into the corresponding arrhythmic D. melanogaster mutant (per01 or tim01) and observed >50% rhythmicity but the period of activity rhythm was either longer (D. pseudoobscura-per) or shorter than 24 h (D. pseudoobscura-tim) compared to controls. By introducing both transgenes simultaneously into double mutants, we observed that the period of the activity rhythm was rescued by the pair of hemizygous transgenes (~24 h). These flies also showed a more optimal level of temperature compensation for the period. Under LD 12:12 these flies have a D. pseudoobscura like activity profile with the absence of morning anticipation as well as a very prominent earlier evening peak of activity rhythm. These observation are consistent with the view that TIM and PER form a heterospecific coevolved module at least for the circadian period of activity rhythms.

Structural Variants and Selective Sweep Foci Contribute to Insecticide Resistance in the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel,30190421,10.1534/g3.118.200619,"Patterns of nucleotide polymorphism within populations of Drosophila melanogaster suggest that insecticides have been the selective agents driving the strongest recent bouts of positive selection.

Here, we screen the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel with two common insecticides; malathion (an organophosphate) and permethrin (a pyrethroid). Genome-wide association studies map survival on malathion to two of the largest sweeps in the D. melanogaster genome; Ace and Cyp6g1 Malathion survivorship also correlates with lines which have high levels of Cyp12d1, Jheh1 and Jheh2 transcript abundance. Permethrin phenotypes map to the largest cluster of P450 genes in the Drosophila genome, however in contrast to a selective sweep driven by insecticide use, the derived allele seems to be associated with susceptibility. These results underscore previous findings that highlight the importance of structural variation to insecticide phenotypes: Cyp6g1 exhibits copy number variation and transposable element insertions, Cyp12d1 is tandemly duplicated, the Jheh loci are associated with a Bari1 transposable element insertion, and a Cyp6a17 deletion is associated with susceptibility.",2018,"Paul Battlay, Pontus B Leblanc, Llewellyn Green, Nandita R Garud, Joshua M Schmidt, Alexandre Fournier-Level, Charles Robin, Paul Battlay, Pontus B Leblanc, Llewellyn Green, Nandita R Garud, Joshua M Schmidt, Alexandre Fournier-Level, Charles Robin"
"Overexpression of CBS and CSE genes affects lifespan, stress resistance and locomotor activity in Drosophila melanogaster",30408770,10.18632/aging.101630,"Recent experimental studies highlighted the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in aging and longevity. The cystathionine ?-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine Î³-lyase (CSE) are the key enzymes responsible for H2S production. Here we investigated the geroprotective effects of CSE and CBS overexpression in Drosophila. Overexpression of CSE did not affect a lifespan and decrease (mitochondrial form of CSE) or increase (cytoplasmic form of CSE) age dynamics of locomotor activity, while overexpression of CBS increase median (by 12.5%) and maximum (by 6.9%) lifespan and locomotor activity. Increasing of both CSE and CBS expression levels resulted in thermotolerance, but the resistance to combination of arid and food-free conditions decreased. The resistance to oxidative stress (paraquat) was not affected in flies with overexpression of CBS and cytoplasmic CSE, but decreased in flies overexpressing mitochondrial form of CSE. Thus, transgene overexpression of the CSE and CBS in Drosophila induce similar effects on stress-resistance and locomotor activity, however lifespan extending effect was revealed for CBS overexpression only.",2018,"Mikhail Shaposhnikov, Ekaterina Proshkina, Lyubov Koval, Nadezhda Zemskaya, Alex Zhavoronkov, Alexey Moskalev, Mikhail Shaposhnikov, Ekaterina Proshkina, Lyubov Koval, Nadezhda Zemskaya, Alex Zhavoronkov, Alexey Moskalev"

Efficacy of Hydroxy-L-proline (HYP) analogs in the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria in Drosophila Melanogaster,29980178,10.1186/s12882-018-0980-8,"Background:
      
    

    
      Substrate reduction therapy with analogs reduces the accumulation of substrates by inhibiting the metabolic pathways involved in their biosynthesis, providing new treatment options for patients with primary hyperoxalurias (PHs) that often progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This research aims to evaluate the inhibition efficacy of Hydroxy-L-proline (HYP) analogs against calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystal formation in the Drosophila Melanogaster (D. Melanogaster) by comparing them with Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6).
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Three stocks of Drosophila Melanogaster (W118, CG3926 RNAi, and Act5C-GAL4/CyO) were utilized. Two stocks (CG3926 RNAi and Act5C-GAL4 /CyO) were crossed to generate the Act5C > dAGXT RNAi recombinant line (F1 generation) of D. Melanogaster which was used to compare the efficacy of Hydroxy-L-proline (HYP) analogs inhibiting CaOx crystal formation with Vitamin B6 as the traditional therapy for primary hyperoxaluria.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Nephrolithiasis model was successfully constructed by downregulating the function of the dAGXT gene in D. Melanogaster (P-Value = 0.0045). Furthermore, the efficacy of Hydroxy-L-proline (HYP) analogs against CaOx crystal formation was demonstrated in vivo using D. Melanogaster model; the results showed that these L-Proline analogs were better in inhibiting stone formation at very low concentrations than Vitamin B6 (IC50 = 0.6 and 1.8% for standard and dietary salt growth medium respectively) compared to N-acetyl-L-Hydroxyproline (IC50 = 0.1% for both standard and dietary salt growth medium) and Baclofen (IC50 = 0.06 and 0.1% for standard and dietary salt growth medium respectively). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) also showed that Hydroxy-L-proline (HYP) analogs were better alternatives for CaOx inhibition at very low concentration especially when both genetics and environmental factors are intertwined (p < 0.0008) for the dietary salt growth medium and (P < 0.063) for standard growth medium.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Addition of Hydroxy-L-Proline analogs to growth medium resulted in the reduction of CaOx crystals formation. These analogs show promise as potential inhibitors for oxalate reduction in Primary Hyperoxaluria.",2018,"Huan Yang, Musa Male, Yang Li, Ning Wang, Chenming Zhao, Shan Jin, Juncheng Hu, Zhiqiang Chen, Zhangqun Ye, Hua Xu"
Drosophila melanogaster Models of Friedreich's Ataxia,29850527,10.1155/2018/5065190,"Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a rare inherited recessive disorder affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems and other extraneural organs such as the heart and pancreas. This incapacitating condition usually manifests in childhood or adolescence, exhibits an irreversible progression that confines the patient to a wheelchair, and leads to early death. FRDA is caused by a reduced level of the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein frataxin due to an abnormal GAA triplet repeat expansion in the first intron of the human FXN gene. FXN is evolutionarily conserved, with orthologs in essentially all eukaryotes and some prokaryotes, leading to the development of experimental models of this disease in different organisms. These FRDA models have contributed substantially to our current knowledge of frataxin function and the pathogenesis of the disease, as well as to explorations of suitable treatments. Drosophila melanogaster, an organism that is easy to manipulate genetically, has also become important in FRDA research. This review describes the substantial contribution of Drosophila to FRDA research since the characterization of the fly frataxin ortholog more than 15 years ago. Fly models have provided a comprehensive characterization of the defects associated with frataxin deficiency and have revealed genetic modifiers of disease phenotypes.

A simple computer vision pipeline reveals the effects of isolation on social interaction dynamics in Drosophila,30161262,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006410,"Isolation profoundly influences social behavior in all animals. In humans, isolation has serious effects on health. Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model to study small-scale, temporally-transient social behavior. However, longer-term analysis of large groups of flies is hampered by the lack of effective and reliable tools. We built a new imaging arena and improved the existing tracking algorithm to reliably follow a large number of flies simultaneously. Next, based on the automatic classification of touch and graph-based social network analysis, we designed an algorithm to quantify changes in the social network in response to prior social isolation. We observed that isolation significantly and swiftly enhanced individual and local social network parameters depicting near-neighbor relationships. We explored the genome-wide molecular correlates of these behavioral changes and found that whereas behavior changed throughout the six days of isolation, gene expression alterations occurred largely on day one. These changes occurred mostly in metabolic genes, and we verified the metabolic changes by showing an increase of lipid content in isolated flies. In summary, we describe a highly reliable tracking and analysis pipeline for large groups of flies that we use to unravel the behavioral, molecular and physiological impact of isolation on social network dynamics in Drosophila.",2018,"Guangda Liu, Tanmay Nath, Gerit A Linneweber, Annelies Claeys, Zhengyu Guo, Jin Li, Mercedes Bengochea, Steve De Backer, Barbara Weyn, Manu Sneyders, Hans Nicasy, Peng Yu, Paul Scheunders, Bassem A Hassan, Guangda Liu, Tanmay Nath, Gerit A Linneweber, Annelies Claeys, Zhengyu Guo, Jin Li, Mercedes Bengochea, Steve De Backer, Barbara Weyn, Manu Sneyders, Hans Nicasy, Peng Yu, Paul Scheunders, Bassem A Hassan"
Diet has independent effects on the pace and shape of aging in Drosophila melanogaster,28914388,10.1007/s10522-017-9729-1,"Studies examining how diet affects mortality risk over age typically characterise mortality using parameters such as aging rates, which condense how much and how quickly the risk of dying changes over time into a single measure. Demographers have suggested that decoupling the tempo and the magnitude of changing mortality risk may facilitate comparative analyses of mortality trajectories, but it is unclear what biologically meaningful information this approach offers. Here, we determine how the amount and ratio of protein and carbohydrate ingested by female Drosophila melanogaster affects how much mortality risk increases over a time-standardised life-course (the shape of aging) and the tempo at which animals live and die (the pace of aging). We find that pace values increased as flies consumed more carbohydrate but declined with increasing protein consumption. Shape values were independent of protein intake but were lowest in flies consuming ~90 Î¼g of carbohydrate daily. As protein intake only affected the pace of aging, varying protein intake rescaled mortality trajectories (i.e. stretched or compressed survival curves), while varying carbohydrate consumption caused deviation from temporal rescaling (i.e. changed the topography of time-standardised survival curves), by affecting pace and shape. Clearly, the pace and shape of aging may vary independently in response to dietary manipulation. This suggests that there is the potential for pace and shape to evolve independently of one another and respond to different physiological processes. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for independent variation in pace and shape, may offer insight into the factors underlying diverse mortality trajectories.",2018,"C Ruth Archer, Ugofilippo Basellini, John Hunt, Stephen J Simpson, Kwang Pum Lee, Annette Baudisch, C Ruth Archer, Ugofilippo Basellini, John Hunt, Stephen J Simpson, Kwang Pum Lee, Annette Baudisch"
Sex differences in life span: Females homozygous for the X chromosome do not suffer the shorter life span predicted by the unguarded X hypothesis,29430636,10.1111/evo.13434,"Life span differs between the sexes in many species. Three hypotheses to explain this interesting pattern have been proposed, involving different drivers: sexual selection, asymmetrical inheritance of cytoplasmic genomes, and hemizygosity of the X(Z) chromosome (the unguarded X hypothesis). Of these, the unguarded X has received the least experimental attention. This hypothesis suggests that the heterogametic sex suffers a shortened life span because recessive deleterious alleles on its single X(Z) chromosome are expressed unconditionally. In Drosophila melanogaster, the X chromosome is unusually large (??0% of the genome), providing a powerful model for evaluating theories involving the X. Here, we test the unguarded X hypothesis by forcing D. melanogaster females from a laboratory population to express recessive X-linked alleles to the same degree as males, using females exclusively made homozygous for the X chromosome. We find no evidence for reduced life span or egg-to-adult viability due to X homozygozity. In contrast, males and females homozygous for an autosome both suffer similar, significant reductions in those traits. The logic of the unguarded X hypothesis is indisputable, but our results suggest that the degree to which recessive deleterious X-linked alleles depress performance in the heterogametic sex appears too small to explain general sex differences in life span.",2018,"Martin Brengdahl, Christopher M Kimber, Jack Maguire-Baxter, Urban Friberg, Martin Brengdahl, Christopher M Kimber, Jack Maguire-Baxter, Urban Friberg"

In the Drosophila melanogaster visual system, a fourth-order neuron-T4-is the first cell type in the ON pathway to exhibit directionally selective signals. Here we use in vivo whole-cell recordings of T4 to show that directional selectivity originates from simple integration of spatially offset fast excitatory and slow inhibitory inputs, resulting in a suppression of responses to the nonpreferred motion direction. We constructed a passive, conductance-based model of a T4 cell that accurately predicts the neuron's response to moving stimuli.

A Wake-Promoting Circadian Output Circuit in Drosophila,30270186,10.1016/j.cub.2018.07.024,"Circadian clocks play conserved roles in gating sleep and wake states throughout the day-night cycle [1-5]. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, DN1p clock neurons have been reported to play both wake- and sleep-promoting roles [6-11], suggesting a complex coupling of DN1p neurons to downstream sleep and arousal centers. However, the circuit logic by which DN1p neurons modulate sleep remains poorly understood. Here, we show that DN1p neurons can be divided into two morphologically distinct subsets. Projections from one subset surround the pars intercerebralis, a previously defined circadian output region [12]. In contrast, the second subset also sends presynaptic termini to a visual processing center, the anterior optic tubercle (AOTU) [13]. Within the AOTU, we find that DN1p neurons inhibit a class of tubercular-bulbar (TuBu) neurons that act to promote consolidated sleep. These TuBu neurons in turn form synaptic connections with R neurons of the ellipsoid body, a region linked to visual feature detection, locomotion, spatial memory, and sleep homeostasis [14-17]. Our results define a second output arm from DN1p neurons and suggest a role for TuBu neurons as regulators of sleep drive.",2018,"AngÃ©lique Lamaze, Patrick KrÃ¤tschmer, Ko-Fan Chen, Simon Lowe, James E C Jepson, AngÃ©lique Lamaze, Patrick KrÃ¤tschmer, Ko-Fan Chen, Simon Lowe, James E C Jepson"

We have tested this hypothesis by examining whether faithful prion propagation occurs in the normally PrPC-null invertebrate host Drosophila melanogaster. Ovine PrP transgenic Drosophila exposed at the larval stage to ovine scrapie showed a progressive accumulation of transmissible prions in adult flies. Strikingly, the biological properties of distinct ovine prion strains were maintained during their propagation in Drosophila.

Dosage compensation regulatory proteins and the evolution of sex chromosomes in Drosophila,8889531,,"In the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, the four male specific lethal (msl) genes are required to achieve dosage compensation of the male X chromosome.

The histone H4 acetylated isoform, H4Ac16, colocalizes with the MSL proteins at a majority of sites on the D. melanogaster X chromosome. Using polytene chromosome immunostaining of other species from the genus Drosophila, we found that X chromosome association of MSL proteins and H4Ac16 is conserved despite differences in the sex chromosome karyotype between species.

Efficient transcriptional silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires a heterochromatin histone acetylation pattern,8754835,10.1128/mcb.16.8.4349,"Heterochromatin in metazoans induces transcriptional silencing, as exemplified by position effect variegation in Drosophila melanogaster and X-chromosome inactivation in mammals. Heterochromatic DNA is packaged in nucleosomes that are distinct in their acetylation pattern from those present in euchromatin, although the role these differences play in the structure of heterochromatin or in the effects of heterochromatin on transcriptional activity is unclear. Here we report that, as observed in the facultative heterochromatin of the inactive X chromosome in female mammalian cells, histones H3 and H4 in chromatin spanning the transcriptionally silenced mating-type cassettes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are hypoacetylated relative to histones H3 and H4 of transcriptionally active regions of the genome. By immunoprecipitation of chromatin fragments with antibodies specific for H4 acetylated at particular lysine residues, we found that only three of the four lysine residues in the amino-terminal domain of histone H4 spanning the silent cassettes are hypoacetylated. Lysine 12 shows significant acetylation levels. This is identical to the pattern of histone H4 acetylation observed in centric heterochromatin of D. melanogaster. These two observations provide additional evidence that the silent cassettes are encompassed in the yeast equivalent of metazoan heterochromatin. Further, mutational analysis of the amino-terminal domain of histone H4 in S. cerevisiae demonstrated that this observed pattern of histone H4 acetylation is required for transcriptional silencing. This result, in conjunction with prior mutational analyses of yeast histones H3 and H4, indicates that the particular pattern of nucleosome acetylation found in heterochromatin is required for its effects on transcription and is not simply a side effect of heterochromatin formation.",1996,"M Braunstein, R E Sobel, C D Allis, B M Turner, J R Broach, M Braunstein, R E Sobel, C D Allis, B M Turner, J R Broach"

Also, no relationship has been detected between Ks estimates and codon usage bias along the gene, in contrast with the generally observed relationship among genes. This heterogeneous distribution of synonymous substitutions along the Xdh gene, which is expression-level independent, could be explained by a differential selection pressure on synonymous sites along the coding region acting on mRNA secondary structure.

Polyembryonic development: insect pattern formation in a cellularized environment,8631257,,"THe polyembryonic wasp Copidosoma floridanum produces up to 2000 individuals from a single egg. During the production of individual embryos the original anteroposterior axis of the egg is lost and axial patterning must subsequently be reestablished within each embryo. The mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. In most insects, egg polarity is established during oogenesis and early development takes place in a syncytium. In Drosophila melanogaster, the syncytium is considered essential for establishing the morphogenetic gradients that initiate segmental patterning. However, we found that development of C. floridanum occurs almost exclusively in a cellularized environment. To determine whether the D. melanogaster patterning cascade is conserved in the absence of a syncytium, we analyzed the expression of Even-skipped, Engrailed and Ultrabithorax/Abdominal-A during polyembryonic development. Here we show that in spite of the absence of a syncytium, the elements of the D. melanogaster segmentation hierarchy are conserved. The segment-polarity gene Engrailed and the homeotic genes Ultrabithorax/Abdominal-A are expressed in a conserved pattern relative to D. melanogaster. However, we detect an alteration in the expression of the Even-skipped antigen. Even-skipped is initially expressed in segmentally reiterated stripes and not in the pair-rule pattern as it is in D. melanogaster. We also observe that the expression of these regulatory proteins does not occur during the early proliferative phases of polyembryony.

Response of two heat shock genes to selection for knockdown heat resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,8844150,,"To identify genes involved in stress resistance and heat hardening, replicate lines of Drosophila melanogaster were selected for increased resistance to knockdown by a 39 degrees heat stress. Two selective regimes were used, one with and one without prior hardening. Mean knockdown times were increased from approximately 5 min to > 20 min after 18 generations. Initial realized heritabilities were as high as 10% for lines selected without hardening, and crosses between lines indicated simple additive gene effects for the selected phenotypes. To survey allelic variation and correlated selection responses in two candidate stress genes, hsr-omega and hsp68, we applied denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to amplified DNA sequences from small regions of these genes. After eight generations of selection, allele frequencies at both loci showed correlated responses for selection following hardening, but not without hardening. The hardening process itself was associated with a hsp68 frequency change in the opposite direction to that associated with selection that followed hardening. These stress loci are closely linked on chromosome III, and the hardening selection established a disequilibrium, suggesting an epistatic effect on resistance.

Implications of the IML-2 experiment,8987567,10.1016/0168-1656(96)01407-1,"Earlier Space experiments had indicated that young male Drosophila flies exposed to microgravity showed an acceleration in aging. In a 14.5-day Space Shuttle Flight we sent 300 young male flies with the purpose of confirming these findings and to establish whether changes in the behavior of the flies were responsible for the effect in accordance with the proposal that alterations in mitochondrial metabolism may be involved in the aging response. By repeatedly video-recording, we have found a very marked increase in the locomotor activity of the fruitflies in Space. The males showed an accelerated aging response upon recovery, both in terms of physiological vitality assays (mating and negative geotaxis) and of life-span curves. The involvement of mitochondrial metabolism is also suggested by the finding of a greater decrease in mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA in the microgravity exposed flies than in ground controls. On the other hand, a parallel 1 x g centrifuge control did not show such differences in the life-span curves when compared to flies exposed to a similar centrifugation on the ground. Drosophila females also increased their locomotor activity but did not show differential changes in the life-span curves. These results are discussed in terms of the current mechanisms of aging in multicellular eukaryotic organisms.",1996,"A BengurÃ­a, E Grande, E de Juan, C Ugalde, J Miquel, R Garesse, R Marco, A BengurÃ­a, E Grande, E de Juan, C Ugalde, J Miquel, R Garesse, R Marco"
Drosophila melanogaster genomic DNA sequence homologous to mammalian cytosine DNA-methyltransferase gene,8799463,10.1080/15216549600201381,"Using Southern blotting procedure we have shown that Drosophila genomic DNA hybridizes with 4423-bp C-terminal fragment of murine cytosine DNA-methyltransferase gene. Thus, the Drosophila genome has a sequence homologous to the mammalian cytosine DNA-methyltransferase gene. We assume that DNA methylation most likely responsible for strong CpG suppression in the Drosophila genome mainly was catalyzed by a cytosine DNA-methyltransferase that has since been lost.",1996,"B F Vanyushin, L A Poirier, B F Vanyushin, L A Poirier"
"Response of Drosophila metallothionein promoters to metallic, heat shock and oxidative stresses",8603742,10.1016/0014-5793(95)01544-2,"The metallothionein system in Drosophila melanogaster is composed of two genes, Mtn and Mto. In order to compare the induction properties of these genes, we transformed D. melanogaster with P-element vectors containing Adh and lacZ reporter genes under the control of Mtn and Mto promoters, respectively. Mtn and Mto transgenes are mainly expressed in digestive tract. However, Mtn expression has been detected also in the fat body. Mtn and Mto transgenes respond differently to metallic, heat-shock and oxidative stresses. These data confirm that both genes are in part functionally different.",1996,"F Bonneton, L ThÃ©odore, P Silar, G Maroni, M Wegnez"
The family of polo-like kinases,9552388,10.1007/978-1-4615-5873-6_11,"Here we discuss members of a new family of serine/threonine protein kinases with a likely role in cell cycle control. These kinases are referred to as polo-like kinases, after the prototypic founding member of the family, the polo gene product of Drosophila melanogaster. The polo kinase was originally identified in mutants that display abnormal mitotic spindle organization. Subsequently, potential homologues of Drosophila polo have been identified in yeasts (Cdc5p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae; plo1+ in Schizosaccharmoyces pombe) and in mammals (polo-like kinase 1; Plk1). Genetic and biochemical studies suggest that polo, Cdc5p and plo1+ may be required for mitotic spindle organization and, possibly, for cytokinesis. Likewise, the patterns of expression, activity and subcellular localization of Plk1 strongly suggest that this mammalian kinase functions also during mitosis, possibly in spindle assembly and function. In addition to Plk1, however, more distantly related members of the polo-like kinase family have been identified in mammalian cells, and the available data are consistent with the idea that some of these may act earlier in the cell cycle, possibly during G1. If this hypothesis is correct, different members of the polo-like kinase family would act at several points during the cell cycle, reminiscent of the behaviour of Cdk/cyclin complexes.",1996,"R M Golsteyn, H A Lane, K E Mundt, L Arnaud, E A Nigg, R M Golsteyn, H A Lane, K E Mundt, L Arnaud, E A Nigg"
"Purification, characterization, and cDNA cloning of a galactose-specific C-type lectin from Drosophila melanogaster",8702748,10.1074/jbc.271.33.20213,"We purified a lectin from a pupal extract of Drosophila melanogaster. This lectin agglutinated trypsinized and glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine red blood cells in the presence of calcium or magnesium. The hapten sugar of this lectin was galactose. The molecular mass of the intact lectin was determined to be 41 kDa, and it comprised 14- and 17-kDa subunits. The 17-kDa subunit was shown to be a glycosylated form of the 14-kDa subunit. Analysis of the cDNA for this lectin revealed that the 14-kDa subunit consists of 163 amino acid residues and contains all residues conserved in various C-type lectins. It was suggested that the Drosophila lectin and Sarcophaga lectin share some properties and function similarly in defense and development, but probably they are not structural homologues.",1996,"S Haq, T Kubo, S Kurata, A Kobayashi, S Natori, S Haq, T Kubo, S Kurata, A Kobayashi, S Natori"

Spatial and temporal immunocytochemical analysis of drosulfakinin (Dsk) gene products in the Drosophila melanogaster central nervous system,8581950,10.1007/s004410050518,"The spatial and temporal distribution of three peptides, DSK I, DSK II, and DSK 0, encoded by the Drosophila melanogaster drosulfakinin (Dsk) gene, have been examined in the central nervous system. DSK I and DSK II have a -RFamide C-terminus and are structurally similar to sulfakinin peptides; in contrast, DSK 0 contains -SFamide and is not structurally similar to sulfakinins. Antisera specificities were determined by the design of the antigens and confirmed by dot blot analysis and preincubation with peptides prior to their use in immunocytochemistry. The distribution of immunoreactivity suggests that all three DSK peptides are processed from the polypeptide precursor and expressed in many of the same cells. Expression was observed at all developmental stages with an increase in the level of staining and the number of immunoreactive cells as development progresses. Cells in the brain lobe, optic lobe, subesophageal ganglion, thoracic ganglia, and the eighth abdominal neuromere contain DSK-immunoreactive materials. Immunoreactive fibers project from some cells and extend into the brain and ventral ganglion with regions of extensive arborization. DSK 0 immunoreactivity provides initial evidence for the presence of a -SFamide peptide in neural tissue. The observed expression of DSK-immunoreactive materials throughout development in numerous cells of the central nervous system suggests that DSK peptides may serve as hormones, modulators, or transmitters involved in several functions.",1996,"R Nichols, I A Lim, R Nichols, I A Lim"
"hiiragi, a gene essential for wing development in Drosophila melanogaster, affects the Notch cascade",8979376,10.1266/ggs.71.247,"A recessive mutation, hiiragiP1, on the second chromosome of Drosophila was obtained by P element insertion mutagenesis. Flies homozygous for hiiragiP1 have notched wing margins. Genetic interactions between hiiragi and the genes that encode components of Notch signaling, such as Notch, Hairless, Serrate and deltex, strongly support the involvement of hiiragi in the signal transduction cascade of Notch. It has been reported that Serrate and Delta, other components of Notch signaling, share EGF-like repeats and a second conserved cysteine-rich motif, and that these components interact physically with the same region of Notch. In hiiragiP1; SerrateD/+ double mutants, we observed synergistic enhancement of the notched phenotype of wing margins. In contrast, Delta FX3 had no phenotypic effect on hiiragiP1 in hiiragiP1; Delta FX3/+ double mutants. Taken together, these results indicate that hiiragi is involved in the Notch signaling cascade induced by Serrate rather than by Delta.",1996,"T Murata, K Ogura, R Murakami, H Okano, K K Yokoyama, T Murata, K Ogura, R Murakami, H Okano, K K Yokoyama"
Germline transformation using a prune cDNA rescues prune/killer of prune lethality and the prune eye color phenotype in Drosophila,8978047,,"Null mutations in the prune gene of Drosophila melanogaster result in prune eye color due to reductions in red pigment accumulation. When one copy of the awd(Killer of prune) mutant gene is present in a prune background, the animals die. The cause of prune/Killer of prune lethality remains unknown. The genomic region characterized for the prune locus is transcriptionally active and complex, with multiple and overlapping transcripts. Despite the transcriptional complexity of the genomic region of prune, accumulated evidence suggests that the prune locus is small and consists of a single transcription unit, since every prune allele to date exhibits both prune eye color and prune/Killer of prune lethality. A functional prune product from a single, full-length cDNA was identified in this study that can rescue both the eye phenotype and prune/Killer of prune lethality. The DNA sequences of several mutant prune alleles along with Western blot analysis of mutant proteins provide convincing evidence that prune mutations are nulls, and that the cDNA identified in this study encodes the only product of the prune locus.",1996,"L Timmons, A Shearn, L Timmons, A Shearn"
Encapsulation ability of Drosophila melanogaster: a genetic analysis,3926550,10.1016/0145-305x(85)90112-0,"Insects are able to effectively recognize parasitoid eggs or larvae and to eliminate them by formation of a hemocytic capsule. Although the cellular process is now well documented, the genetic aspects of recognition of foreignness and the encapsulation process are still poorly understood.

Dihydrofolate reductase activity and resistance to aminopterin in various species of Drosophila,3929018,10.1007/BF00383318,"The aim of our work was to compare the mechanisms of resistance to aminopterin, inhibitor of the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme, between different Drosophila species and those described for cultured cells. Moreover we compared the systematic species divisions based on morphological traits and those based on a molecular approach. For this purpose, the effect of aminopterin on viability and wing phenotype was studied in different Drosophila species. Dihydrofolate reductase was measured in adult flies. We found an important dihydrofolate reductase activity in the melanogaster sub-group compared to the other species studies. Wing effect was observed only in this sub-group. The effects of aminopterin on the wing phenotype were very similar to the phenotype of rudimentary mutants. Both deplete the pyrimidine pool and it has been shown by the studies of the structural genes of the nucleotide pyrimidine pathway that the wing tissue is very sensitive to every pertubation of this metabolism. The D. ananassae species was found to be fully resistant at the concentrations of the inhibitor tested. No or very little dihydrofolate reductase activity was detected. The binding of the enzyme to the inhibitor was comparable to that found in the Oregon strain of D. melanogaster. The purine and pyrimidine salvage pathways were investigated and the D. ananassae species displayed an important thymidine kinase activity. The D. ananassae flies were sensitive on Sang medium compared to the Oregon flies but were able to use exogenous bases or nucleosides more efficiently.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1985,"J Silber, A Coste, C Bazin, A Le Menn, J Silber, A Coste, C Bazin, A Le Menn"
A second opsin gene expressed in the ultraviolet-sensitive R7 photoreceptor cells of Drosophila melanogaster,2952772,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.07-05-01558.1987,"We have identified a second Drosophila opsin gene, Rh4, which is expressed specifically in the ultraviolet-sensitive R7 photoreceptor cells. The two R7 opsins, Rh3 and Rh4, are expressed in nonoverlapping subsets of R7 cells. The Rh4 opsin shares 72% amino acid identity with Rh3, but is only about 35% homologous with the other 2 Drosophila opsins, ninaE and Rh2. Twenty-eight amino acids are conserved among all 4 invertebrate and 5 vertebrate opsin genes thus far sequenced, suggesting that these residues play an important role in rhodopsin function.",1987,"C Montell, K Jones, C Zuker, G Rubin, C Montell, K Jones, C Zuker, G Rubin"

Behavioral and sensory basis of courtship success in Drosophila melanogaster,3114743,10.1073/pnas.84.17.6200,"In Drosophila some individuals are more successful at mating than others. Reproductive fitness is strongly dependent upon the ability to recognize and compete for members of the opposite sex. Experiments were designed to answer two questions. (i) What behavioral components are characteristic or predictive of successful courtship? and (ii) How important is the information transmitted in the different sensory channels for courtship success in each sex? These questions were approached by two experimental procedures. Flies having a sensory deficiency (olfactory, auditory, or visual) competed with wild-type flies of the same sex for mates. Males were found to rely upon sensory channels different from those used by females in order to court successfully. In addition, the courtships of pairs of various genotypes were recorded and subjected to multivariate analysis. The multivariate courtship profiles deviated most widely from those of successful wild-type pairs when the male or female was unable to receive information in the sensory channel most important for successful mating by that sex. Both sequential and quantitative courtship properties were altered when one participant was deficient in ability to receive certain sensory information.",1987,"T A Markow, T A Markow"
