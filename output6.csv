Rap-GEF/Rap signaling restricts the formation of supernumerary spermathecae in Drosophila melanogaster,16573734,10.1111/j.1440-169X.2006.00854.x,"Sperm storage in the female is a key factor for reproductive success in a variety of organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster. The spermathecae (SP) are the Drosophila organs for long-term storage. While wild-type female flies have two SP, occasionally, three or four SP have been observed in mutant flies. However, the molecular mechanism of SP formation is unknown. Here we show that loss of function of a Drosophila Rap-GEF (GEF26) result in an occurrence of the supernumerary SP; females have three SP (varies from 11 to 62% in different allele combinations) instead of the normal two SP. In addition, the Gef26 mutant flies also have ectopic wing veins and extra mechanosensory organs. The supernumerary SP phenotype of the Gef26 mutation can be enhanced by the Drosophila Rap mutations and rescued by overexpressing the cell adhesion molecule DE-cadherin. These data suggest that the Rap-GEF/Rap signaling controls the formation of supernumerary spermathecae through modulating cell adhesion in Drosophila.",2006,"Shree R Singh, Su-Wan Oh, Wei Liu, Xiu Chen, Zhiyu Zheng, Steven X Hou, Shree R Singh, Su-Wan Oh, Wei Liu, Xiu Chen, Zhiyu Zheng, Steven X Hou"
"Molecular cloning and characterization of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor in Drosophila melanogaster",1322910,,"We isolated a cDNA encoding an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) of Drosophila melanogaster. The predicted Drosophila InsP3R (2,833 amino acids) has extensive sequence similarity to the mouse InsP3R. The polypeptide encoded by the cDNA was functionally expressed and showed characteristic InsP3-binding activity. The Drosophila InsP3R gene is located at the region 83A5-9 on the third chromosome and expresses throughout development but predominantly in the adult. Localization of the InsP3R mRNA in adult tissues suggests strong expression in the retina and antenna, indicating the involvement of the InsP3R in visual and olfactory transduction. In addition, the InsP3R mRNA is abundant in the legs and thorax, which are enriched with a muscular system. Such localization is apparently consistent with the quantitatively predominant sites for [3H]InsP3 binding in Drosophila and the fleshfly (Boettcherisca peregrina). The present study points to the likely functional importance of the InsP3/Ca2+ signaling system in Drosophila.",1992,"S Yoshikawa, T Tanimura, A Miyawaki, M Nakamura, M Yuzaki, T Furuichi, K Mikoshiba, S Yoshikawa, T Tanimura, A Miyawaki, M Nakamura, M Yuzaki, T Furuichi, K Mikoshiba"
Effects of ionizing radiation at Drosophila melanogaster with differently active hobo transposons,31287364,10.1080/09553002.2019.1642534,"Purpose: The role of transposable elements in formation of radiobiological effects is understudied and contradictory. The aim of this study was to investigate the response of Drosophila melanogaster to irradiation depending on the level of activity hobo transposons and the role of hobo transposons in formation of ionizing radiation late effects.Materials and methods: The individuals of Drosophila melanogaster with different level activity of hobo-elements were exposed to acute irradiation in doses of 1-100 Gy at early ontogenesis stages. The reaction of individuals to exposure was studied using the larvae survival rate, morphological parameters of reproduction system, DNA damage rate, and mutability of mini-white locus.Results: We found the pronounced linear deferred effects of irradiation for animals with a high activity level of full-size hobo copies. The radiosensitivity of individuals with a mean level of activity transposon was whether higher or did not differ from the radiosensitivity of animals with a low activity hobo.Conclusion: The obtained results suggest that full-size hobo-elements with a high activity level (less often with a mean activity level) are responsible for delayed deleterious irradiation effects.",2019,"Elena Yushkova, Elena Yushkova"
The interplay between intestinal bacteria and host metabolism in health and disease: lessons from Drosophila melanogaster,26935105,10.1242/dmm.023408,"All higher organisms negotiate a truce with their commensal microbes and battle pathogenic microbes on a daily basis. Much attention has been given to the role of the innate immune system in controlling intestinal microbes and to the strategies used by intestinal microbes to overcome the host immune response. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the metabolisms of intestinal microbes and their hosts are linked and that this interaction is equally important for host health and well-being. For instance, an individual's array of commensal microbes can influence their predisposition to chronic metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. A better understanding of host-microbe metabolic interactions is important in defining the molecular bases of these disorders and could potentially lead to new therapeutic avenues. Key advances in this area have been made using Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we review studies that have explored the impact of both commensal and pathogenic intestinal microbes on Drosophila carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. These studies have helped to elucidate the metabolites produced by intestinal microbes, the intestinal receptors that sense these metabolites, and the signaling pathways through which these metabolites manipulate host metabolism. Furthermore, they suggest that targeting microbial metabolism could represent an effective therapeutic strategy for human metabolic diseases and intestinal infection.",2016,"Adam C N Wong, Audrey S Vanhove, Paula I Watnick, Adam C N Wong, Audrey S Vanhove, Paula I Watnick"
Evolution of sexual dimorphism of wing shape in the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup,19457235,10.1186/1471-2148-9-110,"Background:
      
    

    
      Sexual dimorphism of body size has been the subject of numerous studies, but few have examined sexual shape dimorphism (SShD) and its evolution. Allometry, the shape change associated with size variation, has been suggested to be a main component of SShD. Yet little is known about the relative importance of the allometric and non-allometric components for the evolution of SShD.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We investigated sexual dimorphism in wing shape in the nine species of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. We used geometric morphometrics to characterise wing shape and found significant SShD in all nine species. The amount of shape difference and the diversity of the shape changes evolved across the group. However, mapping the divergence of SShD onto the phylogeny of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup indicated that there is little phylogenetic signal. Finally, allometry accounted for a substantial part of SShD, but did not explain the bulk of evolutionary divergence in SShD because allometry itself was found to be evolutionarily plastic.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      SShD in the Drosophila wing can evolve rapidly and therefore shows only weak phylogenetic structure. The variable contribution of allometric and non-allometric components to the evolutionary divergence of SShD and the evolutionary plasticity of allometry suggest that SShD and allometry are influenced by a complex interaction of processes.",2009,"Nelly A Gidaszewski, Michel Baylac, Christian Peter Klingenberg, Nelly A Gidaszewski, Michel Baylac, Christian Peter Klingenberg"
ADAPTATION TO FERMENTING RESOURCES IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER: ETHANOL AND ACETIC ACID TOLERANCES SHARE A COMMON GENETIC BASIS,28568957,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03886.x,"Ethanol and acetic acid tolerances were compared in a French, highly tolerant population, and in a Congolese, very sensitive population. For both tolerances, chromosome substitutions demonstrated a major effect on chromosome 3, a lesser effect on chromosome 2, and no effect on chromosome 1, except in interactions. Directional selection experiments led to significant increases of tolerance to both toxics. Of greater interest, a strong correlated response was observed in each line: increased ethanol tolerance was accompanied by higher acetic acid tolerance and vice versa. A high genetic correlation (average value r = 0.77) was found between the two traits. These data suggest that alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity does not play a major role in explaining the physiological differences known between Afrotropical and European populations. The metabolic flux permitting the detoxification of ethanol and acetic acid seems to be mainly controlled by acetyl-coA synthetase (ACS) at least in adult flies. Acetic acid adaptation could be as important as ethanol adaptation in the ecology of Drosophila melanogaster and other Drosophila species.",1996,"Mohamed Chakir, Pierre Capy, Jean Genermont, Eliane Pla, Jean R David, Mohamed Chakir, Pierre Capy, Jean Genermont, Eliane Pla, Jean R David"
EVOLUTIONARY STEPS AND TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER: THE MISSING RP TYPE OBTAINED BY GENETIC TRANSFORMATION,28564366,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1987.tb05857.x,"The I-R and P-M hybrid dysgenesis systems in Drosophila melanogaster have been interpreted as due to recent invasions of the genome by the I and P mobile genetic elements. Temporal and geographical surveys have never shown individuals harboring P sequences but devoid of active I elements. We describe here the successful genetic transformation by autonomous P elements of embryos initially devoid of active I elements and any P sequences. The results demonstrate that P elements may invade the genome of Drosophila melanogaster in the absence of active I elements. Using gel blotting, in situ hybridization techniques, and genetic experiments, we have monitored the behavior of newly introduced P elements in several transformed lines over 30 generations. The switch of cytotype from M to P occurred very slowly and the number of P copies simultaneously increased to about 25. These RP lines possess the properties required to induce P-M hybrid dysgenesis but totally retain the R cellular state. Consequently, this new mobile element combination presents a strong reciprocal post-zygotic isolation with IM strains due to both P-M and I-R hybrid dysgenesis systems. This genomic incompatibility could be considered as a first step toward speciation in Drosophila populations.",1987,"D Anxolabéhère, H Beneš, D Nouaud, G Periquet, D Anxolabéhère, H Beneš, D Nouaud, G Periquet"
Cytosolic glutathione S-transferases in Drosophila melanogaster,6439209,10.1016/0006-2952(84)90153-9,"Post-microsomal supernatants from Drosophila melanogaster and rat liver homogenates were investigated with respect to their glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity. It appeared that the Drosophila transferase did not conjugate the epoxides styrene-7,8-oxide and 1,2 epoxy-3(p-nitrophenoxy)-propane. Attempts to isolate the Drosophila GST isozymes by means of the well-documented method for the purification of the rat liver transferases failed, because the Drosophila transferases did not bind to CM-cellulose. Purification by subsequent ion exchange on DEAE-cellulose, molecular sieving on Sephadex G-100 and hydroxylapatite chromatography, revealed three active fractions from Drosophila cytosol and five active fractions from rat liver cytosol, using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as the electrophilic substrate. None of the Drosophila active fractions catalyzed the conjugation of glutathione with the epoxides mentioned. It is concluded that there are important differences between the GST systems of both species, resulting in differences in the metabolic fate of chemicals that are substrates for glutathione conjugation. This has to be taken into account in the evaluation of genotoxicity testing in Drosophila of potentially harmful compounds.",1984,"M Jansen, A J Baars, D D Breimer, M Jansen, A J Baars, D D Breimer"
Corp Regulates P53 in Drosophila melanogaster via a Negative Feedback Loop,26230084,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005400,"The tumor suppressor P53 is a critical mediator of the apoptotic response to DNA double-strand breaks through the transcriptional activation of pro-apoptotic genes. This mechanism is evolutionarily conserved from mammals to lower invertebrates, including Drosophila melanogaster. P53 also transcriptionally induces its primary negative regulator, Mdm2, which has not been found in Drosophila. In this study we identified the Drosophila gene companion of reaper (corp) as a gene whose overexpression promotes survival of cells with DNA damage in the soma but reduces their survival in the germline. These disparate effects are shared by p53 mutants, suggesting that Corp may be a negative regulator of P53. Confirming this supposition, we found that corp negatively regulates P53 protein level. It has been previously shown that P53 transcriptionally activates corp; thus, Corp produces a negative feedback loop on P53. We further found that Drosophila Corp shares a protein motif with vertebrate Mdm2 in a region that mediates the Mdm2:P53 physical interaction. In Corp, this motif mediates physical interaction with Drosophila P53. Our findings implicate Corp as a functional analog of vertebrate Mdm2 in flies.",2015,"Riddhita Chakraborty, Ying Li, Lei Zhou, Kent G Golic, Riddhita Chakraborty, Ying Li, Lei Zhou, Kent G Golic"

Genotoxic effects of cisplatin in somatic tissue of Drosophila melanogaster,3121310,10.1002/em.2850100210,"Third instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster transdihybrid for mwh and flr were exposed to varying concentrations of cisplatin by feeding on dry media wetted with aqueous solutions of the test compound. Larval feeding continued until pupation, and surviving transdihybrid adults were collected seven days following commencement of feeding. Wings of adults were removed and scored under 400X magnification for the presence of twin spots and single spots comprised of clones of cells possessing malformed wing hairs. Cisplatin was found to induce both twin spots and single spots, and significant (p less than 0.05) linear concentration-response relationships were obtained with respect to the induction of all endpoints. Induction of twin spots demonstrates that cisplatin induces mitotic recombination in the somatic tissue of Drosophila larvae. This capacity to induce mitotic exchange in the somatic tissue of Drosophila compares well with the compound's reported ability to induce chromosome breaks in Drosophila germ cells [Brodberg et al. 1983]. However, not all compounds possess similar genotoxic profiles in the somatic and germ tissue of Drosophila.",1987,"A J Katz, A J Katz"
Local recombination and mutation effects on molecular evolution in Drosophila,10545459,,"I studied the cause of the significant difference in the synonymous-substitution pattern found in the achaete-scute complex genes in two Drosophila lineages, higher codon bias in Drosophila yakuba, and lower bias in D. melanogaster. Besides these genes, the functionally unrelated yellow gene showed the same substitution pattern, suggesting a region-dependent phenomenon in the X-chromosome telomere. Because the numbers of A/T --> G/C substitutions were not significantly different from those of G/C --> A/T in the yellow noncoding regions of these species, a AT/GC mutational bias could not completely account for the synonymous-substitution biases. In contrast, we did find an approximately 14-fold difference in recombination rates in the X-chromosome telomere regions between the two species, suggesting that the reduction of recombination rates in this region resulted in the reduction of the efficacy of selection in D. melanogaster. In addition, the D. orena yellow showed a 5% increase in the G + C content at silent sites in the coding and noncoding regions since the divergence from D. erecta. This pattern was significantly different from those at the orena Adh and Amy loci. These results suggest that local changes in recombination rates and mutational pressures are contributing to the irregular synonymous-substitution patterns in Drosophila.",1999,"T Takano-Shimizu, T Takano-Shimizu"
Characterization of Autophagic Responses in Drosophila melanogaster,28237115,10.1016/bs.mie.2016.09.089,"Drosophila is an excellent model system for studying autophagy during animal development due to the availability of genetic reagents and opportunity for in vivo cell biological analysis. The regulation and mechanism of autophagy are highly evolutionarily conserved and the role of autophagy has been characterized during various stages of Drosophila development as well as following starvation. Studies in Drosophila have revealed novel insights into the role of distinct components of the autophagy machinery. This chapter describes protocols for examining autophagy during Drosophila development. A crucial step in the induction of autophagy is the incorporation of Atg8a into the autophagosome. This can be measured as autophagic puncta using live fluorescent imaging, immunostaining, or immunoblot analysis of LC3/Atg8a processing. The level of autophagy can also be examined using other specific components of the autophagy pathway as markers detected by immunofluorescent imaging. Based on the distinct morphology of autophagy, it can also be examined by transmission electron microscopy. In addition, one of the advantages of using Drosophila as a model is the ability to undertake genetic analysis of individual components of the autophagy machinery. Current approaches that can be used to monitor autophagy, including the overall flux and individual steps in Drosophila melanogaster, will be discussed.",2017,"T Xu, S Kumar, D Denton, T Xu, S Kumar, D Denton"
Autonomous replication in Drosophila melanogaster tissue culture cells,7587582,10.1007/BF00357686,"This study addresses the ability of DNA fragments from various sources to mediate autonomous DNA replication in cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells. We created a series of plasmids containing genomic DNA fragments from the Ultrabithorax gene of Drosophila and test ed them for autonomous replication after transfection into Schneider line 2 cells. We found that all plasmids containing Drosophila DNA were able to replicate autonomously, as were random human and Escherichia coli genomic DNA fragments. Most of the plasmids were detectable 18 days after transfection in the absence of selection, suggesting that transfected DNA is maintained in Drosophila cells without rapid loss or degradation. The finding that all plasmids containing Drosophila, human or bacterial DNA replicate autonomously in Drosophila cells suggests that the signals that direct autonomous replication in Drosophila contain a low degree of sequence specificity. A two-dimensional gel analysis of initiation on one of the plasmids was consistent with many dispersed initiation sites. Low sequence specificity and dispersed initiation sites also characterize autonomous replication in human cells and Xenopus eggs and may be general properties of autonomous replication in animal cells.",1995,"J G Smith, M P Calos, J G Smith, M P Calos"
Somatic cell mutations caused by 365 nm LED-UVA due to DNA double-strand breaks through oxidative damage,25027494,10.1039/c4pp00148f,"Evidence is accumulating indicating that UVA (320-400 nm ultraviolet light) plays an important role in photo-carcinogenesis. UVA is thought to produce reactive oxygen species in irradiated cells through photo-activation of inherent photosensitizers, and was recently reported to cause DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in exposed cells. We have investigated the involvement of UVA in mutations and DNA damage in somatic cells using Drosophila melanogaster larvae. Using the Okazaki Large Spectrograph, we previously observed that longer wavelength UVA (>330 nm) was more mutagenic in post-replication repair-deficient D. melanogaster (mei-41) than in the nucleotide excision repair-deficient strain (mei-9). LED-light has recently been developed as a high-dose-rate UVA source. LED-UVA light (365 nm) was also more mutagenic in mei-41 than in mei-9. The mei-41 gene was shown to be an orthologue of the human ATR gene, which is involved in the repair of DSBs through phosphorylation of histone H2AX. In order to estimate the extent to which oxidative damage contributes to mutation, we established a new D. melanogaster strain (urate-null mutant) that is sensitive to oxidative damage and has a marker to detect somatic cell mutations. When somatic cell mutations were examined using this strain, LED-UVA was mutagenic in the urate-null strain at doses that were non-mutagenic in the urate-positive strain. In an effort to investigate the generation of DSBs, we examined the presence of phosphorylated histone H2AvD (H2AX D. melanogaster homologue). At high doses of LED-UVA (>800 kJ m(-2)), levels of phosphorylated H2AvD (γ-H2AvD) increased significantly in the urate-null strain. Moreover, the level of γ-H2AvD increased in the excision repair-deficient strain but not in the ATR-deficient strain following UVA-irradiation. These results supported the notion that the generation of γ-H2AvD was mediated by the function of the mei-41 gene. It was reported that ATR functions on DSB repair in D. melanogaster. Taken together, we propose a possible pathway for UVA-induced mutation, whereby DNA double-strand breaks resulting from oxidative stress might be responsible for UVA-induced mutation in somatic cells of D. melanogaster larvae.",2014,"Xing Fang, Naohiro Ide, Sho-Ichi Higashi, Yasuhiro Kamei, Tatsushi Toyooka, Yuko Ibuki, Kazuaki Kawai, Hiroshi Kasai, Keinosuke Okamoto, Sakae Arimoto-Kobayashi, Tomoe Negishi, Xing Fang, Naohiro Ide, Sho-Ichi Higashi, Yasuhiro Kamei, Tatsushi Toyooka, Yuko Ibuki, Kazuaki Kawai, Hiroshi Kasai, Keinosuke Okamoto, Sakae Arimoto-Kobayashi, Tomoe Negishi"
Oral magnetite nanoparticles disturb the development of Drosophila melanogaster from oogenesis to adult emergence,24964248,10.3109/17435390.2014.929189,"The potential impacts of nanomaterials (NMs) on fetal development have attracted great concerns because of the increased potential exposure to NMs during pregnancy. Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis and developmental transitions may provide an attractive system to study the biological and environmental effects of NMs on the embryonic development. In this study, the effects of three types of magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles (MNPs): UN-MNPs (pristine), CA-MNPs (citric acid modified) and APTS-MNPs (3-aminopropyltriethoxylsilane coated) on the development of Drosophila at 300 and 600 μg/g dosage were studied. The uptake of MNPs by female and male flies caused obvious reduction in the female fecundity, and the developmental delay at the egg-pupae and pupae-adult transitions, especially in those treated by the positive APTS-MNPs. Further investigation demonstrates that the parental uptake of MNPs disturbs the oogenesis period, induces ovarian defect, reduces the length of eggs, decreases the number of nurse cells and delays egg chamber development, which may contribute to the decrease of fecundity of female Drosophila and the development delay of their offspring. Using the synchrotron radiation-based micro-X-ray fluorescence (SR-μXRF), the dyshomeostasis of trace elements such as Fe, Ca and Cu along the anterior-posterior axis of the fertilized eggs was found, which may be an important reason for the development delay of Drosophila.",2015,"Hanqing Chen, Bing Wang, Weiyue Feng, Wei Du, Hong Ouyang, Zhifang Chai, Xiaolin Bi, Hanqing Chen, Bing Wang, Weiyue Feng, Wei Du, Hong Ouyang, Zhifang Chai, Xiaolin Bi"
UDP-galactose 4'-epimerase activities toward UDP-Gal and UDP-GalNAc play different roles in the development of Drosophila melanogaster,22654673,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002721,"In both humans and Drosophila melanogaster, UDP-galactose 4'-epimerase (GALE) catalyzes two distinct reactions, interconverting UDP-galactose (UDP-gal) and UDP-glucose (UDP-glc) in the final step of the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism, and also interconverting UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-galNAc) and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-glcNAc). All four of these UDP-sugars serve as vital substrates for glycosylation in metazoans. Partial loss of GALE in humans results in the spectrum disorder epimerase deficiency galactosemia; partial loss of GALE in Drosophila melanogaster also results in galactose-sensitivity, and complete loss in Drosophila is embryonic lethal. However, whether these outcomes in both humans and flies result from loss of one GALE activity, the other, or both has remained unknown. To address this question, we uncoupled the two activities in a Drosophila model, effectively replacing the endogenous dGALE with prokaryotic transgenes, one of which (Escherichia coli GALE) efficiently interconverts only UDP-gal/UDP-glc, and the other of which (Plesiomonas shigelloides wbgU) efficiently interconverts only UDP-galNAc/UDP-glcNAc. Our results demonstrate that both UDP-gal and UDP-galNAc activities of dGALE are required for Drosophila survival, although distinct roles for each activity can be seen in specific windows of developmental time or in response to a galactose challenge. By extension, these data also suggest that both activities might play distinct and essential roles in humans.",2012,"Jennifer M I Daenzer, Rebecca D Sanders, Darwin Hang, Judith L Fridovich-Keil, Jennifer M I Daenzer, Rebecca D Sanders, Darwin Hang, Judith L Fridovich-Keil"

PIC and PIC[O7] reversibly inhibited ACh-evoked currents mediated by vertebrate rodent (r)α1β1δγ, rα1β1δε and human (h)α3β2, but not hα7 nAChR subtypes expressed in Xenopus oocytes with the following selectivity: rα1β1δε > rα1β1δγ ≈ hα3β2 >> hα7. Our study emphasizes the importance of loop size and α-conotoxin sequence specificity for receptor binding. These studies can be used for the evaluation of the neuropharmacology of novel α-conotoxins that can be utilized as molecular probes for diseases such as, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and cancer.

A Genomic Map of the Effects of Linked Selection in Drosophila,27536991,10.1371/journal.pgen.1006130,"Natural selection at one site shapes patterns of genetic variation at linked sites. Quantifying the effects of ""linked selection"" on levels of genetic diversity is key to making reliable inference about demography, building a null model in scans for targets of adaptation, and learning about the dynamics of natural selection. Here, we introduce the first method that jointly infers parameters of distinct modes of linked selection, notably background selection and selective sweeps, from genome-wide diversity data, functional annotations and genetic maps. The central idea is to calculate the probability that a neutral site is polymorphic given local annotations, substitution patterns, and recombination rates. Information is then combined across sites and samples using composite likelihood in order to estimate genome-wide parameters of distinct modes of selection. In addition to parameter estimation, this approach yields a map of the expected neutral diversity levels along the genome. To illustrate the utility of our approach, we apply it to genome-wide resequencing data from 125 lines in Drosophila melanogaster and reliably predict diversity levels at the 1Mb scale. Our results corroborate estimates of a high fraction of beneficial substitutions in proteins and untranslated regions (UTR). They allow us to distinguish between the contribution of sweeps and other modes of selection around amino acid substitutions and to uncover evidence for pervasive sweeps in untranslated regions (UTRs). Our inference further suggests a substantial effect of other modes of linked selection and of adaptation in particular. More generally, we demonstrate that linked selection has had a larger effect in reducing diversity levels and increasing their variance in D. melanogaster than previously appreciated.",2016,"Eyal Elyashiv, Shmuel Sattath, Tina T Hu, Alon Strutsovsky, Graham McVicker, Peter Andolfatto, Graham Coop, Guy Sella, Eyal Elyashiv, Shmuel Sattath, Tina T Hu, Alon Strutsovsky, Graham McVicker, Peter Andolfatto, Graham Coop, Guy Sella"
Interaction between temperature and male pheromone in sexual isolation in Drosophila melanogaster,23944628,10.1111/jeb.12206,"In Drosophila, female hydrocarbons are known to be involved in premating isolation between different species and pheromonal races. The role of male-specific hydrocarbon polymorphism is not as well documented. The dominant cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) in male D. melanogaster is usually 7-tricosene (7-T), with the exception of African populations, in which 7-pentacosene (7-P) is dominant. Here, we took advantage of a population from the Comoro Islands (Com), in which males fell on a continuum of low to high levels of 7-T, to perform temperature selection and selection on CHCs' profiles. We conducted several experiments on the selected Com males to study the plasticity of their CHCs in response to temperature shift, their role in resistance to desiccation and in sexual selection. We then compared the results obtained for selected lines to those from three common laboratory strains with different and homogenous hydrocarbon profiles: CS, Cot and Tai. Temperature selection modified the CHC profiles of the Com males in few generations of selection. We showed that the 7-P/7-T ratio depends on temperature with generally more 7-P at higher temperatures and observed a relationship between chain length and resistance to desiccation in both temperature- and phenotypically selected Com lines. There was partial sexual isolation between the flies with clear-cut phenotypes within the phenotypically selected lines and the laboratory strains. These results indicate that the dominant male pheromones are under environmental selection and may have played a role in reproductive isolation.",2013,"G Bontonou, B Denis, C Wicker-Thomas, G Bontonou, B Denis, C Wicker-Thomas"
Modulation of genotoxicity by extra-virgin olive oil and some of its distinctive components assessed by use of the Drosophila wing-spot test,20732449,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2010.08.012,"Olive oil is an important source of mono-unsaturated fat and a prime component of the Mediterranean diet. The beneficial health effects of olive oil are due to both its high content of mono-unsaturated fatty acids and its high content of anti-oxidative substances. The objective of this study was to investigate the basis for the epidemiological information relating to the health benefits associated with the consumption of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO). For this purpose, the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in wings of Drosophila melanogaster was applied to evaluate the antigenotoxic activity of six different EVOOs from four Spanish varieties (Hojiblanca, Nevadillo, Casta de Cabra, Picual). A two-level approach was followed: (1) determination of the lack of genotoxicity along with the antigenotoxic activity of EVOOs, through antigenotoxicity assays, with hydrogen peroxide as an oxidative genotoxin, and (2) evaluation of the properties of three major distinctive components of EVOOs that could be responsible for their antigenotoxic activity. The EVOOs tested are shown to be non-genotoxic; they exhibited antigenotoxic activity against the effects of hydrogen peroxide. Triolein, tyrosol and squalene did not show genotoxic effects in the proliferative imaginal cells of D. melanogaster. The three components were antigenotoxic when combined with soybean oil, only triolein and tyrosol showed a clear desmutagenic effect when combined with hydrogen peroxide. Our results confirm the safety of EVOOs and their health-protective effects.",2010,"Jaouad Anter, Juan Campos-Sánchez, Rachid El Hamss, Mar Rojas-Molina, Andrés Muñoz-Serrano, Mohamed Analla, Angeles Alonso-Moraga, Jaouad Anter, Juan Campos-Sánchez, Rachid El Hamss, Mar Rojas-Molina, Andrés Muñoz-Serrano, Mohamed Analla, Angeles Alonso-Moraga"
Genotype and gene expression associations with immune function in Drosophila,20066029,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000797,"It is now well established that natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster harbor substantial genetic variation associated with physiological measures of immune function. In no case, however, have intermediate measures of immune function, such as transcriptional activity of immune-related genes, been tested as mediators of phenotypic variation in immunity. In this study, we measured bacterial load sustained after infection of D. melanogaster with Serratia marcescens, Providencia rettgeri, Enterococcus faecalis, and Lactococcus lactis in a panel of 94 third-chromosome substitution lines. We also measured transcriptional levels of 329 immune-related genes eight hours after infection with E. faecalis and S. marcescens in lines from the phenotypic tails of the test panel. We genotyped the substitution lines at 137 polymorphic markers distributed across 25 genes in order to test for statistical associations among genotype, bacterial load, and transcriptional dynamics. We find that genetic polymorphisms in the pathogen recognition genes (and particularly in PGRP-LC, GNBP1, and GNBP2) are most significantly associated with variation in bacterial load. We also find that overall transcriptional induction of effector proteins is a significant predictor of bacterial load after infection with E. faecalis, and that a marker upstream of the recognition gene PGRP-SD is statistically associated with variation in both bacterial load and transcriptional induction of effector proteins. These results show that polymorphism in genes near the top of the immune system signaling cascade can have a disproportionate effect on organismal phenotype due to the amplification of minor effects through the cascade.",2010,"Timothy B Sackton, Brian P Lazzaro, Andrew G Clark, Timothy B Sackton, Brian P Lazzaro, Andrew G Clark"
Odor Coding in Insects,21882428,,"Most organisms rely on their olfactory system to detect and analyze olfactory cues in the environment, cues that are subsequently utilized in the context of behavior. Odorants are recognized by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), which are located in the olfactory epithelia of vertebrates or in the dendrites of olfactory sensory cells within the sensilla on the antennal surface of insects (Buck and Axel 1991; Carlson 2001; Chess et al. 1992; Vosshall et al. 2000). The OSNs express odorant receptors (ORs), which are related to seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and transduce odorant binding to cellular excitation (see also Chapter 7). The olfactory system of the genetic model organism, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, has been the focus of numerous investigations. Drosophila has two pairs of olfactory organs, the antennae and the maxillary palps. Each antenna contains about 1200 OSNs housed in a total of 410 olfactory sensilla covering the antenna, while the maxillary palp has about 120 OSNs and 60 olfactory sensilla (Laissue and Vosshall 2007). The sensilla are of three morphological types: basiconic sensilla, trichoid sensilla, and coeloconic sensilla (Venkatesh and Singh 1984). Across insects, there is a beautiful diversity of sensillar morphologies, including pore plate sensilla, campaniform sensilla, sensilla ampullacea, and more (Kleineidam and Tautz 1996; Steinbrecht 1996). In recent studies, the OR gene family of D. melanogaster has been identified and shown to comprise 62 defned members (Table 2.1) (Clyne et al. 1999; Gao and Chess 1999; Vosshall et al. 1999). Several studies have been dedicated to characterize the molecular receptive ranges of identified ORs (Dobritsa et al. 2003; Hallem and Carlson 2006; Pelz et al. 2006).",,"C.

Genetic patterning in the adult capitate antenna of the beetle Tribolium castaneum,19059230,10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.10.047,"Antenna structure varies widely among insects, in contrast to the well-conserved structure of legs. The adult capitate antenna of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, is composed of eleven articles, organized into four distinct morphological regions (scape, pedicel, funicle and club). Here, we report the use of RNA interference to examine the functions of 21 genes during antenna metamorphosis in T. castaneum. Genes with conserved functions relative to the developmental model species Drosophila melanogaster include Distal-less and EGF signaling (antennal growth), spineless (determination of antennal identity) and the Notch signaling pathway (antennal growth, joint formation, and sensory bristle development). However, the functions of many genes differed from those predicted from the Drosophila model. In addition to a conserved gap phenotype, depletion of dachshund transformed funicle articles toward club-like identity. Depletion of Distal-less or homothorax did not cause antenna-to-leg transformation. Lim1 was required only for development of the scape-pedicle joint. Depletion of odd-skipped-related genes led to the loss of the entire funicle, while spalt, rotund, spineless, and dachshund affected smaller regions. Growth and joint formation were linked developmentally in the funicle, but not in the club. Joint formation within the club required bric-a-brac, aristaless, apterous, and pdm. Gene functions are discussed in terms of a model of antenna development in T. castaneum. This model provides a contrast to knowledge of antenna development in D. melanogaster, insight into the likely ancestral mode of antenna development, and a framework for considering diverse antenna morphologies.",2009,"David R Angelini, Moto Kikuchi, Elizabeth L Jockusch, David R Angelini, Moto Kikuchi, Elizabeth L Jockusch"
Variation in the relative magnitude of intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects in novel versus familiar environments in two Drosophila species,15536257,10.1007/BF02729895,"Models of competitor coevolution, especially the genetic feedback hypothesis, suggest that a negative correlation between intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects may be important in sustaining competitor coexistence, and can give rise to oscillatory dynamics with repeated reversals of competitive superiority. I reanalyzed previously published census data from an experiment in which populations of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans underwent competitive coevolution in one familiar and two novel environments, to specifically look for any evidence of a negative relationship between intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects on population growth rates, and for any indication of short period cycling in the relative magnitude of intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects. While there was considerable variation in the relative magnitude of intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects over generations, among both populations and environments, there was no clear evidence supporting the genetic feedback hypothesis. Intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects on population growth rates were strongly positively correlated in novel environments, and uncorrelated in the familiar environment. Data from the familiar environment indicated that indices of competition of populations of the initially superior competitor, D. melanogaster, might be showing some cyclic behaviour, but I argue that this is likely to be transient, and not suggestive of sustained oscillatory dynamics predicted by the genetic feedback model. I discuss the results in the context of the importance of the genetic architecture of intraspecific and interspecific competitive abilities in determining the coevolutionary trajectory of competitive interactions.",2004,"Amitabh Joshi, Amitabh Joshi"
Interaction of the mitotic inhibitor monastrol with human kinesin Eg5,12525161,10.1021/bi026716j,"The microtubule-dependent kinesin-like protein Eg5 from Homo sapiens is involved in the assembly of the mitotic spindle. It shows a three-domain structure with an N-terminal motor domain, a central coiled coil, and a C-terminal tail domain. In vivo HsEg5 is reversibly inhibited by monastrol, a small cell-permeable molecule that causes cells to be arrested in mitosis. Both monomeric and dimeric Eg5 constructs have been examined in order to define the minimal monastrol binding domain on HsEg5. NMR relaxation experiments show that monastrol interacts with all of the Eg5 constructs used in this study. Enzymatic techniques indicate that monastrol partially inhibits Eg5 ATPase activity by binding directly to the motor domain. The binding is noncompetitive with respect to microtubules, indicating that monastrol does not interfere with the formation of the motor-MT complex. The binding is not competitive with respect to ATP. Both enzymology and in vivo assays show that the S enantiomer of monastrol is more active than the R enantiomer and racemic monastrol. Stopped-flow fluorometry indicates that monastrol inhibits ADP release by forming an Eg5-ADP-monastrol ternary complex. Monastrol reversibly inhibits the motility of human Eg5. Monastrol has no inhibitory effect on the following members of the kinesin superfamily: MC5 (Drosophila melanogaster Ncd), HK379 (H. sapiens conventional kinesin), DKH392 (D. melanogaster conventional kinesin), BimC1-428 (Aspergillus nidulans BimC), Klp15 (Caenorhabditis elegans C-terminal motor), or Nkin460GST (Neurospora crassa conventional kinesin).",2003,"Salvatore DeBonis, Jean-Pierre Simorre, Isabelle Crevel, Luc Lebeau, Dimitrios A Skoufias, Anne Blangy, Christine Ebel, Pierre Gans, Robert Cross, David D Hackney, Richard H Wade, Frank Kozielski, Salvatore DeBonis, Jean-Pierre Simorre, Isabelle Crevel, Luc Lebeau, Dimitrios A Skoufias, Anne Blangy, Christine Ebel, Pierre Gans, Robert Cross, David D Hackney, Richard H Wade, Frank Kozielski"
Oxidative stress and aging reduce COX I RNA and cytochrome oxidase activity in Drosophila,9801075,10.1016/s0891-5849(98)00153-1,"Drosophila melanogaster displays an age-associated increase in oxidative damage and a decrease in mitochondrial transcripts. To determine if these changes result in energy production deficiencies, we measured the electron transport system (ETS) enzyme activity, and ATP levels with age. No statistically significant influences of age on activities of complexes I and II or citrate synthase were observed. In contrast, from 2 to 45 days post-eclosion, declines were found in complex IV cytochrome c oxidase activity (COX, 40% decline) and ATP abundance (15%), while lipid peroxidation increased 71%. We next examined flies that were either genetically or chemically oxidatively stressed to determine the effect on levels of mitochondrial-encoded cytochrome oxidase I RNA (coxI) and COX activity. A catalase null mutant line had 48% of coxI RNA compared to the wild type. In Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (cSOD) null flies, the rate of coxI RNA decline was greater than in controls. CoxI RNA also declined with increasing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment, which was reflected in reduced cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity. These results show that oxidative stress is closely associated with reductions in mitochondrial transcript levels and support the hypothesis that oxidative stress may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and aging in D. melanogaster.",1998,"S R Schwarze, R Weindruch, J M Aiken, S R Schwarze, R Weindruch, J M Aiken"
Expression of a Drosophila GATA transcription factor in multiple tissues in the developing embryos. Identification of homozygous lethal mutants with P-element insertion at the promoter region,7559649,10.1074/jbc.270.42.25150,"GATA transcription factors are DNA-binding proteins that recognize the core consensus sequence, WGATAR. Previous studies indicated that GATA factors play ann important role in the development of tissue-specific functions in vertebrates. Here we report the identification of a new Drosophila melanogaster GATA factor, dGATAc, which displays a distinct expression pattern in embryos. The local concentration of dGATAc transcripts varies at different stages, being most prominent in the procephalic region at stages 6-10 and in the posterior spiracles, the gut, and the central nervous system at stages 11-13. On the basis of its predicted sequence, DNA-binding assays were performed to confirm that the dGATAc gene encodes a zinc finger protein that can bind the GATA consensus motif with predicted specificity. Two independent mutants carrying a P-element insertion at the dGATAc gene promoter region were identified that are homozygous lethal at the embryonic stage. Using a genetic scheme, it was demonstrated that the lack of dGATAc function can block normal embryonic development. Our results suggest that the dGATAc protein is a tissue-specific transcription factor that is vital to the development of multiple organ systems in D. melanogaster.",1995,"W H Lin, L H Huang, J Y Yeh, J Hoheisel, H Lehrach, Y H Sun, S F Tsai, W H Lin, L H Huang, J Y Yeh, J Hoheisel, H Lehrach, Y H Sun, S F Tsai"
"Enhancer of rudimentaryp1, e(r)p1, a highly conserved enhancer of the rudimentary gene",7896098,,"A hybrid dysgenesis-induced mutation, enhancer of rudimentaryp1 (e(r)p1), is a recessive enhancer of a weak rudimentary mutant phenotype in Drosophila melanogaster. The e(r) gene was cloned using P element tagging and localized to region 8B on the X chromosome. It encodes a 1.0-kb and a 1.2-kb transcript. The 1.0-kb transcript is present in both adult males and females, while the 1.2-kb transcript is predominantly found in females. The difference in the lengths of the two e(r) transcripts is caused by two different polyadenylation sites spaced 228 bp apart. The amounts of both of these transcripts are drastically reduced in the e(r)p1 mutant. The P element in e(r)p1 is inserted in the 5'-untranslated leader region near the start of transcription. It may be producing its effect by suppressing transcription and/or by providing transcription termination and polyadenylation signals. The putative e(r) protein is 104 amino acids in length and bears no striking resemblance to protein sequences in GenBank or PIR. While its biochemical function is unknown at this time, sequence analysis indicates that the e(r) protein is highly conserved and, presumably, functionally very important.

Interspecific comparisons of the unusually long 5' leader of the Drosophila ecdysone-inducible gene E74A,7951266,10.1016/0965-1748(94)90016-7,"The Drosophila melanogaster E74A gene is expressed in response to the steroid hormone ecdysone. Its product is a site-specific DNA-binding protein that is believed to play an important role in the normal development and metamorphosis of the fly. In addition to being under the transcriptional control of ecdysone and its receptor, there is evidence for translational regulation of the E74A mRNA. The E74A mRNA 5' leader is unusually long (nearly 1.9 kb) and contains 17 AUGs, suggesting that translation of the mRNA would be rather inefficient. To identify features and sequences that might be important in regulating E74A translation, we determined the nucleotide sequences of the 5' leaders from the E74A-homologous genes of D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis, comparing them to D. melanogaster. Several conserved characteristics and specific sequences were identified. In addition to conservation of the relative distances separating the three E74A gene exons encoding the 5' leader, all three species have maintained the extensive length of the leader as well as multiple AUGs. Within the 5' leader are numerous conserved sequences, several of which are found at the two ends of the leader and at splice site junctions, where sequence conservation might be expected. A 53-nucleotide sequence element and a 30-nucleotide element in exon 2 are highly conserved and are proposed as candidates for an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of the E74A mRNA.",1994,"C W Jones, C D Jahraus, P V Tran, C W Jones, C D Jahraus, P V Tran"

Three-dimensional architecture of pericardial nephrocytes in Drosophila melanogaster revealed by FIB/SEM tomography,31089884,10.1007/s00441-019-03037-3,"Nephrocytes are similar in structure to podocytes and play a role in the isolation of toxic substances from hemolymph in insects. Drosophila melanogaster nephrocytes have recently been used to study podocyte function and disease. However, the three-dimensional ultrastructure of nephrocytes is not clearly understood because their surrounding basement membrane makes it difficult to observe using conventional scanning electron microscopy. We reconstructed the three-dimensional ultrastructure of Drosophila pericardial nephrocytes using serial focused-ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) images. The basal surfaces were occupied by foot processes and slit-like spaces between them. The slit-like spaces corresponded to the podocyte filtration slits and were formed by longitudinal infolding/invagination of the basal plasma membrane. The basal surface between the slit-like spaces became the foot processes, which ran almost linearly, and had a ""washboard-like"" appearance. Both ends of the foot processes were usually anastomosed to neighboring foot processes and thus free ends were rarely observed. We demonstrated that FIB/SEM is a powerful tool to better understand the three-dimensional architecture of nephrocytes.",2019,"Yuto Kawasaki, Akira Matsumoto, Takayuki Miyaki, Mui Kinoshita, Soichiro Kakuta, Tatsuo Sakai, Koichiro Ichimura, Yuto Kawasaki, Akira Matsumoto, Takayuki Miyaki, Mui Kinoshita, Soichiro Kakuta, Tatsuo Sakai, Koichiro Ichimura"
Particle size-independent induction of leucism in Drosophila melanogaster by silver: nano vs. micro,27782245,10.1039/c6mt00152a,"With the discovery of nanoscience, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) now appear on the ingredient lists of commercial products along with bulk silver or silver microparticles (AgMPs). In the present study, we have compared the effects of silver in both nano and micro forms to assess whether particle size plays a role in the pigmentation pathway, using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. AgNPs were synthesized, characterized and validated. Internalization of the AgNPs and AgMPs was confirmed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Analysis of phenol oxidase (PO) enzyme and total melanin as well as quantification of tyrosine and dihydroxy phenylalanine (dopa) were carried out to understand the perturbation of the melanization pathway. The interactions of AgNP/MP with tyrosine and dopa were investigated using various spectrometric techniques. The absence of PO activity, reduced levels of melanin, tyrosine, and dopa, and the absence of local dissemination of melanin upon cuticle injury confirmed that the AgNPs and AgMPs mediated leucism in Drosophila. The reduction of bulk silver to the nano form upon internalization was found to be the modus operandi for the AgMPs. The actions of the AgNPs and AgMPs were attributed to their binding and interaction with tyrosine and dopa via their phenolic hydroxyl groups. Silver, irrespective of its size, induced leucism in Drosophila melanogaster by binding and interacting with precursor metabolites of the melanization pathway, such as tyrosine and dopa.",2016,"Kanchan A Phatak, Pawan K Khanna, Bimalendu B Nath, Kanchan A Phatak, Pawan K Khanna, Bimalendu B Nath"

Although these chemicals, when used as preservatives, are thought to be safe for humans, many studies have demonstrated that they have estrogenic effects, and can affect the normal development and functions of the reproductive systems in a number of animal species. By treating fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) with EP, here we show that lower concentration of EP (0.02%) enhanced fertility while higher concentration of EP (0.10% and 0.20%) shortened the lifespan and reduced the fecundity of fruit flies. When we analyzed the expression levels of the estrogen-related receptor gene (ERR), ecdysone receptor gene (EcR) and Yolk protein receptor gene (YPR) from control and EP-treated fruit flies by using quantitative real-time PCR, we found that the expression levels of all three genes were significantly changed by EP treatment, and that female fruit flies are more sensitive to EP than males. Our data suggests that the estrogenic and the toxic effects of EP to fruit flies may have a molecular basis through the hormonal effect of EP.",2014,"Ting Liu, Yajuan Li, Xiaojun Zhao, Min Zhang, Wei Gu, Ting Liu, Yajuan Li, Xiaojun Zhao, Min Zhang, Wei Gu"
Compensatory evolution of a precursor messenger RNA secondary structure in the Drosophila melanogaster Adh gene,12972637,10.1073/pnas.1932834100,"Evidence for the evolutionary maintenance of a hairpin structure possibly involved in intron processing had been found in intron 1 of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (Adh) in diverse Drosophila species. In this study, the putative hairpin structure was evaluated systematically in Drosophila melanogaster by elimination of either side of the stem using site-directed mutagenesis. The effects of these mutations and the compensatory double mutant on intron splicing efficiency and ADH protein production were assayed in Drosophila melanogaster Schneider L2 cells and germ-line transformed adult flies. Mutations that disrupt the putative hairpin structure right upstream of the intron branch point were found to cause a significant reduction in both splicing efficiency and ADH protein production. In contrast, the compensatory double mutant that restores the putative hairpin structure was indistinguishable from the WT in both splicing efficiency and ADH level. It was also observed by mutational analysis that a more stable secondary structure (with a longer stem) in this intron decreases both splicing efficiency and ADH protein production. Implications for RNA secondary structure and intron evolution are discussed.",2003,"Ying Chen, Wolfgang Stephan, Ying Chen, Wolfgang Stephan"

The type of specificity is important in understanding the evolutionary response to natural enemies and was studied here in a Drosophila-paxasitoid system. Drosophila melanogaster lines selected for increased larval resistance to the endoparasitoid wasps Asobara tabida or Leptopilina boulardi were exposed to attack by A. tabida, L. boulardi and Leptopilina heterotoma at 15°C, 20°C, and 25°C. In general, encapsulation ability increased with temperature, with the exception of the lines selected against L. boulardi, which showed the opposite trend. Lines selected against L. boulardi showed large increases in resistance against all three parasitoid species, and showed similar levels of defense against A. tabida to the lines selected against that parasitoid. In contrast, lines selected against A. tabida showed a large increase in resistance to A. tabida and generally to L. heterotoma, but displayed only a small change in their ability to survive attack by L. boulardi.

Complex gene organization of synaptic protein SNAP-25 in Drosophila melanogaster,9272858,10.1016/s0378-1119(97)00106-6,"The evolutionarily conserved protein SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein 25 kDa (kilodaltons)) is a component of the protein complex involved in the docking and/or fusion of synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals. We report here that the SNAP-25 gene (Snap) in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has a complex organization with eight exons spanning more than 120 kb (kilobases). The exon boundaries coincide with those of the chicken SNAP-25 gene (Bark, 1993). Only a single exon 5 has been found in Drosophila, whereas human, rat, chicken, zebrafish and goldfish have two alternatively spliced versions of this exon. In situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to whole mount embryos show that SNAP-25 mRNA and protein are detected in stage 14 and later developmental stages, and are mainly localized to the ventral nerve cord. Thus, Snap has an evolutionarily conserved and complex gene organization, and its onset of expression in Drosophila melanogaster correlates with a time in neuronal development when synapses begin to be formed and when other synapse-specific genes are switched on.",1997,"C Risinger, D L Deitcher, I Lundell, T L Schwarz, D Larhammar, C Risinger, D L Deitcher, I Lundell, T L Schwarz, D Larhammar"

Drosophila melanogaster provides a powerful system to investigate the genetic underpinnings of variation in startle behavior. Since mechanically induced, startle responses and environmental conditions can be readily quantified and precisely controlled. The 156 wild-derived fully sequenced lines of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) were used to identify SNPs and transcripts associated with variation in startle behavior. The results validated highly significant effects of 33 quantitative trait SNPs (QTSs) and 81 quantitative trait transcripts (QTTs) directly associated with phenotypic variation of startle response. We also detected QTT variation controlled by 20 QTSs (tQTSs) and 73 transcripts (tQTTs). Association mapping based on genomic and transcriptomic data enabled us to construct a complex genetic network that underlies variation in startle behavior. Based on principles of evolutionary conservation, human orthologous genes could be superimposed on this network. This study provided both genetic and biological insights into the variation of startle response behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, and highlighted the importance of genetic network to understand the genetic architecture of complex traits.",2017,"Angli Xue, Hongcheng Wang, Jun Zhu, Angli Xue, Hongcheng Wang, Jun Zhu"
Genome editing in Drosophila melanogaster: from basic genome engineering to the multipurpose CRISPR-Cas9 system,28527116,10.1007/s11427-017-9029-9,"Nowadays, genome editing tools are indispensable for studying gene function in order to increase our knowledge of biochemical processes and disease mechanisms. The extensive availability of mutagenesis and transgenesis tools make Drosophila melanogaster an excellent model organism for geneticists. Early mutagenesis tools relied on chemical or physical methods, ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) and X-rays respectively, to randomly alter DNA at a nucleotide or chromosomal level. Since the discovery of transposable elements and the availability of the complete fly genome, specific genome editing tools, such as P-elements, zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), have undergone rapid development. Currently, one of the leading and most effective contemporary tools is the CRISPR-cas9 system made popular because of its low cost, effectiveness, specificity and simplicity of use.

To investigate possible involvement of TRP-KYN pathway in mechanisms of neuroprotective effect of CBL, we evaluated CBL effects on metamorphosis and life span of Drosophila melanogaster maintained at 23 °C and 28 °C ambient temperature. CBL accelerated metamorphosis, exerted strong tendency (p = 0.04) to prolong life span in female but not in male flies, and attenuated aging-accelerating effect of high (28 °C) ambient temperature in both female and male flies.

It is however prone to some infections, which may endanger fly stocks if left unchecked for. One such infection is caused by an obligate fungal intracellular parasite, Tubulinosema ratisbonensis, which can be found in laboratory stocks. Here, we identify and briefly characterize a T. ratisbonensis strain that was infesting our Drosophila cultures and that required intensive measures to contain and eradicate the infection. We describe the phenotypes of infested stocks. We also report PCR-based techniques that allow the detection of infested stocks with a high sensitivity. We have developed a high-throughput qPCR assay that allows the efficient parallel screening of a large number of potentially-infested stocks. We also have investigated several prophylactic measures to prevent the further contamination of stocks, namely UV-exposure, ethanol treatment, bleaching, and desiccation. Bleaching was found to kill all spores. Other treatments were less effective but were found to be sufficient to prevent further contamination of noninfested stocks. Two treatments were efficacious in curing infested stocks (1) bleaching of eggs and subsequent raising of the larvae in clean vials; (2) fumagillin treatment.

Navigational decision making in Drosophila thermotaxis,20335462,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4090-09.2010,"A mechanistic understanding of animal navigation requires quantitative assessment of the sensorimotor strategies used during navigation and quantitative assessment of how these strategies are regulated by cellular sensors. Here, we examine thermotactic behavior of the Drosophila melanogaster larva using a tracking microscope to study individual larval movements on defined temperature gradients. We discover that larval thermotaxis involves a larger repertoire of strategies than navigation in smaller organisms such as motile bacteria and Caenorhabditis elegans. Beyond regulating run length (i.e., biasing a random walk), the Drosophila melanogaster larva also regulates the size and direction of turns to achieve and maintain favorable orientations. Thus, the sharp turns in a larva's trajectory represent decision points for selecting new directions of forward movement. The larva uses the same strategies to move up temperature gradients during positive thermotaxis and to move down temperature gradients during negative thermotaxis. Disrupting positive thermotaxis by inactivating cold-sensitive neurons in the larva's terminal organ weakens all regulation of turning decisions, suggesting that information from one set of temperature sensors is used to regulate all aspects of turning decisions. The Drosophila melanogaster larva performs thermotaxis by biasing stochastic turning decisions on the basis of temporal variations in thermosensory input, thereby augmenting the likelihood of heading toward favorable temperatures at all times.",2010,"Linjiao Luo, Marc Gershow, Mark Rosenzweig, Kyeongjin Kang, Christopher Fang-Yen, Paul A Garrity, Aravinthan D T Samuel, Linjiao Luo, Marc Gershow, Mark Rosenzweig, Kyeongjin Kang, Christopher Fang-Yen, Paul A Garrity, Aravinthan D T Samuel"
Paraquat selection identifies X-linked oxygen defense genes in Drosophila melanogaster,8458566,10.1139/g93-021,"We have previously shown that homozygous mutants of Drosophila melanogaster deficient in the oxygen radical scavengers, CuZn superoxide dismutase or urate, are adult viable and yet hypersensitive to the oxygen radical-generating agent, paraquat. Thus, paraquat could be used as a selective agent to identify adult-viable mutants potentially defective in other, perhaps unknown, oxygen defense functions. Here we report the successful use of paraquat hypersensitivity in the isolation of X-linked, ethylmethanesulfonate-induced mutations affecting oxygen defense in Drosophila melanogaster. Two paraquat hypersensitive mutants were identified that, by complementation analysis, were shown to be new alleles of the maroon-like gene. In addition to paraquat hypersensitivity, both alleles confer a maternally affected dark brown eye color and a complete lack of enzymatically active xanthine dehydrogenase, both of which are characteristic phenotypes of known maroon-like alleles. We conclude that the lack of xanthine dehydrogenase in these mutants leads to the absence of urate, which is the proximate cause of paraquat sensitivity. Because our search for such mutants on the X chromosome revealed two alleles of only a single selectable gene, we anticipate that the total number of major oxygen defense genes in the complete Drosophila genome may not be large.",1993,"J M Humphreys, A J Hilliker, J P Phillips, J M Humphreys, A J Hilliker, J P Phillips"
Cell Cycle Kinase Polo Is Controlled by a Widespread 3' Untranslated Region Regulatory Sequence in Drosophila melanogaster,31085682,10.1128/MCB.00581-18,"Alternative polyadenylation generates transcriptomic diversity, although the physiological impact and regulatory mechanisms involved are still poorly understood. The cell cycle kinase Polo is controlled by alternative polyadenylation in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR), with critical physiological consequences. Here, we characterized the molecular mechanisms required for polo alternative polyadenylation. We identified a conserved upstream sequence element (USE) close to the polo proximal poly(A) signal. Transgenic flies without this sequence show incorrect selection of polo poly(A) signals with consequent downregulation of Polo expression levels and insufficient/defective activation of Polo kinetochore targets Mps1 and Aurora B. Deletion of the USE results in abnormal mitoses in neuroblasts, revealing a role for this sequence in vivo We found that Hephaestus binds to the USE RNA and that hephaestus mutants display defects in polo alternative polyadenylation concomitant with a striking reduction in Polo protein levels, leading to mitotic errors and aneuploidy. Bioinformatic analyses show that the USE is preferentially localized upstream of noncanonical polyadenylation signals in Drosophila melanogaster genes.

Edible bird's nest enhances antioxidant capacity and increases lifespan in Drosophila Melanogaster,27188745,,"In this study, we aims to investigate the effects of edible bird's nest (EBN) on anti-aging efficacy. In order to investigate lifespan and mortality rate of flies, we treated flies with various doses of EBN. Besides, fecundity, water content and food are determined and heat-stress test is conducted after flies treating with different medium. Effects of EBN on total antioxidant activity (T-AOC), super-oxide dismutase activity (SOD), catalase activity (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were examined in drosophila melanogaster. Results indicated that flies in EBN treated group illustrated significantly lower mortality rates and longer median and maximum lifespan compared to control group (P<0.05). The fecundity in EBN-treated group was increased compared to control group. SOD levels and CAT activity were significantly increased, and MDA levels decreased in EBN-treated group compared to control group (P<0.01). In conclusion, EBN can extend lifespan, decrease mortality rate and increase survival rate in heat-stress test, and which can also promote SOD and CAT activity and reduce MDA levels. EBN is able to delay drosophila melanogaster aging, attributing to the increasing antioxidant enzyme activities and decreasing content of lipid peroxidation products in drosophila melanogaster.",2016,"Q Hu, G Li, H Yao, S He, H Li, S Liu, Y Wu, X Lai, Q Hu, G Li, H Yao, S He, H Li, S Liu, Y Wu, X Lai"

Common and unique strategies of male killing evolved in two distinct Drosophila symbionts,29563258,10.1098/rspb.2017.2167,"Male killing is a selfish reproductive manipulation caused by symbiotic bacteria, where male offspring of infected hosts are selectively killed. The underlying mechanisms and the process of their evolution are of great interest not only in terms of fundamental biology, but also their potential applications. The two bacterial Drosophila symbionts, Wolbachia and Spiroplasma, have independently evolved male-killing ability. This raises the question whether the underlying mechanisms share some similarities or are specific to each bacterial species. Here, we analyse pathogenic phenotypes of D. bifasciata infected with its natural male-killing Wolbachia strain and compare them with those of D. melanogaster infected with male-killing Spiroplasma We show that male progeny infected with the Wolbachia strain die during embryogenesis with abnormal apoptosis. Interestingly, male-killing Wolbachia infection induces DNA damage and segregation defects in the dosage-compensated chromosome in male embryos, which are reminiscent of the phenotypes caused by male-killing Spiroplasma in D. melanogaster By contrast, host neural development seems to proceed normally unlike male-killing Spiroplasma infection. Our results demonstrate that the dosage-compensated chromosome is a common target of two distinct male killers, yet Spiroplasma uniquely evolved the ability to damage neural tissue of male embryos.",2018,"Toshiyuki Harumoto, Takema Fukatsu, Bruno Lemaitre, Toshiyuki Harumoto, Takema Fukatsu, Bruno Lemaitre"
Cystocyte and lymphocyte derived fusomes/spectrosomes: analogies and differences: a mini-review,12655376,,"Structures analogous to Drosophila spectrosomes were found in mammalian lymphocytes. Repasky and colleagues discovered an intracellular spectrin-rich structure in lymphoid cells, which had far-reaching parallels with the fusome/spectrosome of D. melanogaster germ cells. This fact implies that spectrosomes may be characteristic not only of insect germ cells, but also that an analogous structure may play an important role in other cell types. The term ""spectrosome"" was first used by Lin and Spradling in 1995 to describe a large sphere of fusomal material in D. melanogaster germline stem cells and their differentiated daughter cells - cytoblasts. In the D. melanogaster ovary, membrane skeletal proteins such as ankyrin, alpha/beta spectrin as well as adducin-like Hts protein(s) were found in this specific organelle - spectrosome/fusome. These orgalelles are involved in the creation of mitotic spindles and D. melanogaster cyst formation and oocyte differentiation, but the role of analogous spectrin-based aggregates found in nucleated cells still remains unclear.",2003,"Patrycja M Dubielecka, Katarzyna Stebelska, Bozena Jaźwiec, Aleksander F Sikorski, Patrycja M Dubielecka, Katarzyna Stebelska, Bozena Jaźwiec, Aleksander F Sikorski"
Direct regulation of knot gene expression by Ultrabithorax and the evolution of cis-regulatory elements in Drosophila,15753212,10.1242/dev.01737,"The regulation of development by Hox proteins is important in the evolution of animal morphology, but how the regulatory sequences of Hox-regulated target genes function and evolve is unclear. To understand the regulatory organization and evolution of a Hox target gene, we have identified a wing-specific cis-regulatory element controlling the knot gene, which is expressed in the developing Drosophila wing but not the haltere. This regulatory element contains a single binding site that is crucial for activation by the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci), and a cluster of binding sites for repression by the Hox protein Ultrabithorax (UBX). The negative and positive control regions are physically separable, demonstrating that UBX does not repress by competing for occupancy of Ci-binding sites. Although knot expression is conserved among Drosophila species, this cluster of UBX binding sites is not. We isolated the knot wing cis-regulatory element from D. pseudoobscura, which contains a cluster of UBX-binding sites that is not homologous to the functionally defined D. melanogaster cluster. It is, however, homologous to a second D. melanogaster region containing a cluster of UBX sites that can also function as a repressor element. Thus, the knot regulatory region in D. melanogaster has two apparently functionally redundant blocks of sequences for repression by UBX, both of which are widely separated from activator sequences. This redundancy suggests that the complete evolutionary unit of regulatory control is larger than the minimal experimentally defined control element. The span of regulatory sequences upon which selection acts may, in general, be more expansive and less modular than functional studies of these elements have previously indicated.",2005,"Bradley M Hersh, Sean B Carroll, Bradley M Hersh, Sean B Carroll"
X-linked small GTPase and OXPHOS genes are candidates for the genetic basis of hybrid inviability in Drosophila,12424521,10.1007/s00427-002-0271-y,"Genetic studies on postmating reproductive isolation in Drosophila have suggested that the genetic basis of hybrid inviability is much less complex than the basis of hybrid sterility, and may be associated with defects affecting the cell cycle. Here I report the identification of a cluster of genes in the middle of the X chromosome of D. melanogaster, which may be responsible for the inviability of hybrids between Drosophila species. Genes from this cluster code for small Ras GTPases proteins, which are hypothesized here to interact with proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), encoded by genes present within the same cluster. At least six genes influencing small Ras GTPases/OXPHOS activity are transcribed from the same strand across 35 kb genomic DNA. This interval is predicted to harbor genes which, when mutated, rescue otherwise inviable hybrids between D. melanogaster and its three most closely related species. Moreover, a total of 16 small GTPase/OXPHOS genes are found within 530 kb genomic DNA encompassing the above cluster. In D. melanogaster mutants which fully rescue lethal hybrids, major lesions have now been identified very near or within untranslated regions of two OXPHOS genes from the above cluster. These observations led to a hypothesis focusing on antagonistic co-evolution between biparentally inherited genes influencing putative GTPase/OXPHOS activity and mitochondrial genes encoding OXPHOS proteins. Alterations in some of these genes are postulated to override hybrid inviability, thus revealing a pathway which implicates mitotic genes as critical players in this barrier to reproduction.",2002,"Pierre Hutter, Pierre Hutter"

Amino acid substitutions of Subdued alter the ion selectivity and kinetic properties of the CaCC channels heterologously expressed in HEK 293T cells. This Drosophila channel displays characteristics of classic CaCCs, thereby providing evidence for evolutionarily conserved biophysical properties in the TMEM16 family.

Centromeric foci of the cohesin protein SMC1 are absent in solo mutants at all meiotic stages.

Pervasive variation of transcription factor orthologs contributes to regulatory network evolution,25748510,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005011,"Differences in transcriptional regulatory networks underlie much of the phenotypic variation observed across organisms. Changes to cis-regulatory elements are widely believed to be the predominant means by which regulatory networks evolve, yet examples of regulatory network divergence due to transcription factor (TF) variation have also been observed. To systematically ascertain the extent to which TFs contribute to regulatory divergence, we analyzed the evolution of the largest class of metazoan TFs, Cys2-His2 zinc finger (C2H2-ZF) TFs, across 12 Drosophila species spanning ~45 million years of evolution. Remarkably, we uncovered that a significant fraction of all C2H2-ZF 1-to-1 orthologs in flies exhibit variations that can affect their DNA-binding specificities. In addition to loss and recruitment of C2H2-ZF domains, we found diverging DNA-contacting residues in ~44% of domains shared between D. melanogaster and the other fly species. These diverging DNA-contacting residues, found in ~70% of the D. melanogaster C2H2-ZF genes in our analysis and corresponding to ~26% of all annotated D. melanogaster TFs, show evidence of functional constraint: they tend to be conserved across phylogenetic clades and evolve slower than other diverging residues. These same variations were rarely found as polymorphisms within a population of D. melanogaster flies, indicating their rapid fixation. The predicted specificities of these dynamic domains gradually change across phylogenetic distances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence. Further, whereas proteins with conserved C2H2-ZF domains are enriched in developmental functions, those with varying domains exhibit no functional enrichments. Our work suggests that a subset of highly dynamic and largely unstudied TFs are a likely source of regulatory variation in Drosophila and other metazoans.",2015,"Shilpa Nadimpalli, Anton V Persikov, Mona Singh, Shilpa Nadimpalli, Anton V Persikov, Mona Singh"
Molecular heterochrony in the early development of Drosophila,10618397,10.1073/pnas.97.1.212,"Heterochrony, the relative change of developmental timing, is one of the major modes of macroevolutionary change; it identifies temporally disassociated units of developmental evolution. Here, we report the results of a fine-scale temporal study for the expression of the developmental gene hairy and morphological development in three species of Drosophila, D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. pseudoobscura. The results suggest that between and among closely related species, temporal displacement of ontogenetic trajectory is detected even at the earliest stage of development. Overall, D. simulans shows the earliest expression, followed by D. melanogaster, and then by D. pseudoobscura. Setting D. melanogaster as the standard, we find the approximate time to full expression is accelerated by 13 min, 48 s in D. simulans and retarded by 24 min in D. pseudoobscura. Morphologically, again with D. melanogaster setting the standard, initiation of cellularization is faster in D. simulans by 15 min, 42 s; and initiation of morphogenesis is faster in D. simulans by 18 min, 7 s. These results seem to be consistent with the finding that the approximate time to full expression of hairy is accelerated by 13 min, 48 s in D. simulans. On the other hand, the same morphological events are delayed by 5 min, 32 s, and by 11 min, 32 s, respectively, in D. pseudoobscura. These delays are small, compared with the 24-min delay in full expression. The timing changes, in total, seem consistent with continuous phyletic evolution of temporal trajectories. Finally, we speculate that epigenetic interactions of hairy expression timing and cell-cycle timing may have led to morphological differences in the terminal system of the larvae.",2000,"J Kim, J Q Kerr, G S Min, J Kim, J Q Kerr, G S Min"
Argemone oil induced cellular damage in the reproductive tissues of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster: protective role of 70 kDa heat shock protein,12898646,10.1002/jbt.10082,"We explored the reproductive toxicity of argemone oil and its principal alkaloid fraction in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster (hsp70-lacZ) Bg(9).

The accessory glands of male reproductive system of the fly, which did not express hsp70, exhibited severe damage as evidenced by Trypan blue staining. This prompted us to explore the ultrastructural morphology of the gland, which showed acute signs of necrosis in both the cell types as evident by necrotic nuclei, higher vacuolization, and disorganized endoplasmic reticulum, decrease in the number of Golgi vesicles and disorganized, loosely packed filamentous structures in the lumen of the accessory gland, at the higher concentrations of the adulterant.

      In embryos the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MTZ) integrates post-transcriptional regulation of maternal transcripts with transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying this event are being clarified in Drosophila melanogaster, little is know about the embryogenic processes in other insect species. The recent publication of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from embryos of the global pest species Ceratitis capitata (medfly) has enabled the investigation of embryogenesis in this species and has allowed a comparison of the embryogenic processes in these two related dipteran species, C. capitata and D. melanogaster, that shared a common ancestor 80-100 mya.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Using a novel PCR-based sexing method, which takes advantage of a putative LTR retrotransposon MITE insertion on the medfly Y chromosome, the transcriptomes of individual early male and female embryos were analysed using RT-PCR. This study is focused on two crucial aspects of the onset of embryonic development: sex determination and cellular blastoderm formation. Together with the three known medfly genes (Cctransformer, Cctransformer2 and Ccdoublesex), the expression patterns of other medfly genes that are similar to the D. melanogaster sex-determination genes (sisterlessA, groucho, deadpan, Sex-lethal, female lethal d, sans fille and intersex) and four cellular blastoderm formation genes (Rho1, spaghetti squash, slow-as-molasses and serendipity-alpha) were analyzed, allowing us to sketch a preliminary outline of the embryonic process in the medfly. Furthermore, a putative homologue of the Zelda gene has been considered, which in D. melanogaster encodes a DNA-binding factor responsible for the maternal-to-zygotic transition.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our novel sexing method facilitates the study of i) when the MTZ transition occurs in males and females of C. capitata, ii) when and how the maternal information of ""female-development"" is reprogrammed in the embryos and iii) similarities and differences in the regulation of gene expression in C. capitata and D. melanogaster. We suggest a new model for the onset of the sex determination cascade in the medfly: the maternally inherited Cctra transcripts in the female embryos are insufficient to produce enough active protein to inhibit the male mode of Cctra splicing. The slow rate of development and the inefficiency of the splicing mechanism in the pre-cellular blastoderm facilitates the male-determining factor (M) activity, which probably acts by inhibiting CcTRA protein activity.",2010,"Paolo Gabrieli, Andrea Falaguerra, Paolo Siciliano, Ludvik M Gomulski, Francesca Scolari, Antigone Zacharopoulou, Gerald Franz, Anna R Malacrida, Giuliano Gasperi, Paolo Gabrieli, Andrea Falaguerra, Paolo Siciliano, Ludvik M Gomulski, Francesca Scolari, Antigone Zacharopoulou, Gerald Franz, Anna R Malacrida, Giuliano Gasperi"
The neuroscience of adaptive thermoregulation,30449698,10.1016/j.neulet.2018.10.046,"The nervous system acts as a biological thermostat by controlling behaviors that regulate the warming and cooling of animals. We review the structures responsible for thermoregulation in three model species: roundworms (Caenorhabditis elegans), flies (Drosophila melanogaster), and rats (Rattus novegicus). We then consider additional features of the nervous system required to explain adaptive plasticity of the set-point temperature and the precision of thermoregulation. Because animals use resources such as energy, water, and oxygen to thermoregulate, the nervous system monitors the abundance of these resources and adjusts the strategy of thermoregulation accordingly. Starvation, dehydration, or hypoxemia alter the activity of temperature-sensitive neurons in the pre-optic area of the hypothalamus. Other regions of the brain work in conjunction with the hypothalamus to promote adaptive plasticity of thermoregulation. For example, the amygdala likely inhibits neurons of the pre-optic area, overriding thermoregulation when a risk of predation or a threat of aggression exists. Moreover, the hippocampus enables an animal to remember microhabitats that enable safe and effective thermoregulation. In ectothermic animals, such as C. elegans and D. melanogaster, the nervous system can alter set-point temperatures as the environmental temperatures change. To build on this knowledge, neuroscientists can use experimental evolution to study adaptation of neural phenotypes in controlled thermal environments. A microevolutionary perspective would leverage our understanding of ecological processes to predict the origin and maintenance of neural phenotypes by natural selection.",2019,"Michael J Angilletta Jr, Jacob P Youngblood, Lauren K Neel, John M VandenBrooks, Michael J Angilletta Jr, Jacob P Youngblood, Lauren K Neel, John M VandenBrooks"
Enhanced neurite outgrowth and branching precede increased amyloid-β-induced neuronal apoptosis in a novel Alzheimer's disease model,25125474,10.3233/JAD-140009,"Though it is widely accepted that amyloid-β (Aβ) is a key factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, its underlying mechanism remains unclear.

Cultured neurons undergo a consistent developmental process, culminating in an elaborate neuronal network with distinct functional and morphological characteristics. Throughout this development, a time-dependent increase in intracellular expression levels of Aβ42 was detected, followed by extracellular staining at a later time point. When compared to controls, Aβ42 cultures exhibited enhanced levels of apoptosis, resulting in reduced cell viability. Moreover, as primary culture preparations enable high resolution monitoring of neuronal phenotypes, we were able to detect subtle morphological changes in neurons expressing Aβ42, namely an enhancement in neurite outgrowth and arborization, which preceded the effect of neurodegeneration. Our results establish D. melanogaster primary neuronal cultures as a rapid, accessible and cost-effective platform for AD molecular studies and drug screening, and suggest a possible role for Aβ42 in the organization of neuronal processes.",2015,"Yaara Saad, Daniel Segal, Amir Ayali, Yaara Saad, Daniel Segal, Amir Ayali"
Preservation of genes involved in sterol metabolism in cholesterol auxotrophs: facts and hypotheses,18682733,10.1371/journal.pone.0002883,"Background:
      
    

    
      It is known that primary sequences of enzymes involved in sterol biosynthesis are well conserved in organisms that produce sterols de novo. However, we provide evidence for a preservation of the corresponding genes in two animals unable to synthesize cholesterol (auxotrophs): Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans.
    

    
  


        Principal findings:
      
    

    
      We have been able to detect bona fide orthologs of several ERG genes in both organisms using a series of complementary approaches. We have detected strong sequence divergence between the orthologs of the nematode and of the fruitfly; they are also very divergent with respect to the orthologs in organisms able to synthesize sterols de novo (prototrophs). Interestingly, the orthologs in both the nematode and the fruitfly are still under selective pressure. It is possible that these genes, which are not involved in cholesterol synthesis anymore, have been recruited to perform different new functions. We propose a more parsimonious way to explain their accelerated evolution and subsequent stabilization. The products of ERG genes in prototrophs might be involved in several biological roles, in addition to sterol synthesis. In the case of the nematode and the fruitfly, the relevant genes would have lost their ancestral function in cholesterogenesis but would have retained the other function(s), which keep them under pressure.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      By exploiting microarray data we have noticed a strong expressional correlation between the orthologs of ERG24 and ERG25 in D. melanogaster and genes encoding factors involved in intracellular protein trafficking and folding and with Start1 involved in ecdysteroid synthesis. These potential functional connections are worth being explored not only in Drosophila, but also in Caenorhabditis as well as in sterol prototrophs.",2008,"Giovanna Vinci, Xuhua Xia, Reiner A Veitia, Giovanna Vinci, Xuhua Xia, Reiner A Veitia"
Genotoxicity testing of four textile dyes in two crosses of Drosophila using wing somatic mutation and recombination test,16051555,10.1081/dct-200064473,"In this study, four textile dyes, namely Astrazon Yellow, Red, Blue, and Black, were tested for their genotoxic effects in the wing cells of Drosophila melanogaster. Two crosses were used, the standard cross (ST) and the improved high-bioactivation cross (HB), the latter being characterized by increased sensitivity to the genotoxic effects of promutagens and procarcinogens. Three-day-old larvae were exposed to different concentrations of dyes. Commonly known mutagens were applied as positive controls. All concentrations of textile dyes, ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), and urethane caused a decrease in survival proportional to concentration used. EMS and urethane caused an increase in the number of all types of spots in both standard and high-bioactivation crosses. Compared to ST crosses, the number of induced spots in the HB cross treated with urethane was considerably high. Treatment of the standard and the high-bioactivation crosses with textile dyes gave positive results, apparent from increase in the frequency of the small single spots. Yellow and red dyes also increased the number of large single spots in both crosses, whereas the twin spots were positive only at the highest dose of yellow dye. All these results indicate that D. melanogaster wing spot test can be recommended as a suitable in vivo test for the determination of genotoxicity of textile dyes.",2005,"Eylem Eroglu Dogan, Elif Yesilada, Lutfiye Ozata, Saim Yologlu, Eylem Eroglu Dogan, Elif Yesilada, Lutfiye Ozata, Saim Yologlu"
Patterns of synonymous codon usage in Drosophila melanogaster genes with sex-biased expression,15937136,10.1534/genetics.104.038109,"The nonrandom use of synonymous codons (codon bias) is a well-established phenomenon in Drosophila. Recent reports suggest that levels of codon bias differ among genes that are differentially expressed between the sexes, with male-expressed genes showing less codon bias than female-expressed genes. To examine the relationship between sex-biased gene expression and level of codon bias on a genomic scale, we surveyed synonymous codon usage in 7276 D. melanogaster genes that were classified as male-, female-, or non-sex-biased in their expression in microarray experiments. We found that male-biased genes have significantly less codon bias than both female- and non-sex-biased genes. This pattern holds for both germline and somatically expressed genes. Furthermore, we find a significantly negative correlation between level of codon bias and degree of sex-biased expression for male-biased genes. In contrast, female-biased genes do not differ from non-sex-biased genes in their level of codon bias and show a significantly positive correlation between codon bias and degree of sex-biased expression. These observations cannot be explained by differences in chromosomal distribution, mutational processes, recombinational environment, gene length, or absolute expression level among genes of the different expression classes. We propose that the observed codon bias differences result from differences in selection at synonymous and/or linked nonsynonymous sites between genes with male- and female-biased expression.",2005,"Tina M Hambuch, John Parsch, Tina M Hambuch, John Parsch"
"The gene Sex-lethal of the Sciaridae family (order Diptera, suborder Nematocera) and its phylogeny in dipteran insects",15514063,10.1534/genetics.104.031278,"This article reports the cloning and characterization of the gene homologous to Sex-lethal (Sxl) of Drosophila melanogaster from Sciara coprophila, Rhynchosciara americana, and Trichosia pubescens. This gene plays the key role in controlling sex determination and dosage compensation in D. melanogaster. The Sxl gene of the three species studied produces a single transcript encoding a single protein in both males and females. Comparison of the Sxl proteins of these Nematocera insects with those of the Brachycera showed their two RNA-binding domains (RBD) to be highly conserved, whereas significant variation was observed in both the N- and C-terminal domains. The great majority of nucleotide changes in the RBDs were synonymous, indicating that purifying selection is acting on them. In both sexes of the three Nematocera insects, the Sxl protein colocalized with transcription-active regions dependent on RNA polymerase II but not on RNA polymerase I. Together, these results indicate that Sxl does not appear to play a discriminatory role in the control of sex determination and dosage compensation in nematocerans. Thus, in the phylogenetic lineage that gave rise to the drosophilids, evolution coopted for the Sxl gene, modified it, and converted it into the key gene controlling sex determination and dosage compensation. At the same time, however, certain properties of the recruited ancestral Sxl gene were beneficial, and these are maintained in the evolved Sxl gene, allowing it to exert its sex-determining and dose compensation functions in Drosophila.",2004,"Esther Serna, Eduardo Gorab, M Fernanda Ruiz, Clara Goday, José M Eirín-López, Lucas Sánchez, Esther Serna, Eduardo Gorab, M Fernanda Ruiz, Clara Goday, José M Eirín-López, Lucas Sánchez"
The quantitative genetic basis of male mating behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,15280239,10.1534/genetics.103.024372,"Male mating behavior is an important component of fitness in Drosophila and displays segregating variation in natural populations. However, we know very little about the genes affecting naturally occurring variation in mating behavior, their effects, or their interactions. Here, we have mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting courtship occurrence, courtship latency, copulation occurrence, and copulation latency that segregate between a D. melanogaster strain selected for reduced male mating propensity (2b) and a standard wild-type strain (Oregon-R). Mating behavior was assessed in a population of 98 recombinant inbred lines derived from these two strains and QTL affecting mating behavior were mapped using composite interval mapping. We found four QTL affecting male mating behavior at cytological locations 1A;3E, 57C;57F, 72A;85F, and 96F;99A. We used deficiency complementation mapping to map the autosomal QTL with much higher resolution to five QTL at 56F5;56F8, 56F9;57A3, 70E1;71F4, 78C5;79A1, and 96F1;97B1. Quantitative complementation tests performed for 45 positional candidate genes within these intervals revealed 7 genes that failed to complement the QTL: eagle, 18 wheeler, Enhancer of split, Polycomb, spermatocyte arrest, l(2)05510, and l(2)k02206. None of these genes have been previously implicated in mating behavior, demonstrating that quantitative analysis of subtle variants can reveal novel pleiotropic effects of key developmental loci on behavior.",2004,"Amanda J Moehring, Trudy F C Mackay, Amanda J Moehring, Trudy F C Mackay"
Affinity labeling of a reactive sulfhydryl residue at the peptidyl transferase P site in Drosophila ribosomes,117829,10.1021/bi00592a024,"An affinity label has been prepared that is specific for the P site of a eucaryotic peptidyl transferase, that of Drosophila melanogaster. It has the sequence C-A-C-C-A-(Ac[3H]Leu) with a mercury atom added at the C-5 position of all three cytosine residues (referred to as the mercurated fragment). This label is an analogue of the 3' terminus of N-acetylleucyl-tRNA. The mercurated fragment binds specifically to the P site of peptidyl transferase. It participates fully in peptide bond formation as judged by its ability to transfer N-acetylleucine to puromycin with at least the same efficiency as a nonmercurated fragment. Once bound to the P site, the mercurated fragment reacts covalently with a ribosomal protein(s). This affinity-labeling process can be effectively competed by nonmercurated fragment, which indicates a site-specific reaction. The covalent attachment of the affinity label to a ribosomal protein(s) occurs through the formation of a mercury-sulfur bond, as judged by its lability in the presence of thiol reducing agents. The major ribosomal protein labeled at the P site of D. melanogaster was found to be a small, basic protein. The electrophoretic behavior of this protein parallels that of major P site proteins found in Escherichia coli ribosomes and in other eucaryotes. These results suggest conservation of some of the overall properties of the P site proteins from these organisms.",1979,"S Fabijanski, M Pellegrini, S Fabijanski, M Pellegrini"
Genomic organization in the flesh fly Sarcophaga bullata,533665,10.1007/BF00292203,"The genome of the flesh fly Sarcophaga bullata has been characterized both cytologically and biochemically. S. bullata has a haploid DNA level of 0.61 picograms which is five times larger than the haploid genome size of Drosophila melanogaster. Reassociation kinetics of Sarcophaga DNA shows that its sequence organization is very similar to that of D. melanogaster in having a very large proportion of single copy DNA (81%) and only small amounts of highly and moderately repetitive DNA (9% and 6%, respectively). cRNAs from all three sequence classes were prepared and their cytological distributions on biploid and polytene cells determined by in situ hybridization. The cytological distribution of the highly repetitive probe was found to be restricted to the centromeric heterochromatin of two of the five autosomes and this sequence class was also found to be markedly underreplicated in polytene foot-pad cells. No highly repetitive DNA was localized on either of the sex chromosomes, but only on the two large centromeric regions of chromosomes C and E. Moderately repetitive DNA was found uniformly distributed on all of the autosomes in both testis and polytene foot-pad squashes. As in the case of the highly repetitive sequence probe, no moderately repetitive DNA was detected on either the X or Y chromosomes. Moderately repetitive DNA in Sarcophaga was also shown to have the ""Drosophila type"" pattern of sequence interspersion with a moderately repetitive element of congruent to 5,000 nucleotides adjacent to a unique element of greater than 10,000 nucleotides. The Sarcophaga genome is the largest for which this type of interspersion has so far been demonstrated.",1979,"D Samols, H Swift, D Samols, H Swift"

S2 cells stably transfected with the Drosophila NTPDase6 cDNA displayed strong UDPase activity only after addition of NP-40, indicating the intracellular location of the enzyme. The enzyme hydrolyzed UDP, GDP, and IDP equally well whereas other NDP and NTP were poor substrates. It was not or only partially inhibited by several modulators of the cell surface NTPDases, but was strongly inhibited upon oxidative cross-linking by copper phenanthroline. The decrease of activity correlated with dimer formation. Mutagenesis studies indicated that dimer formation required C42 in the transmembrane domain and C447 in the exoplasmic domain. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that the protein was located primarily in the ER. The substrate specificity and cellular localization of the Drosophila NTPDase6 suggest that it participates in Drosophila glycoprotein processing.",2009,"Aileen F Knowles, Aileen F Knowles"
The epicurean fly: using Drosophila melanogaster to study metabolism,18978647,10.1203/PDR.0b013e318191fc68,"In this review, the utility of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for research in metabolism will be demonstrated. Importantly, many metabolic pathways are conserved in both man and the fly. Recent work has highlighted that these conserved molecular pathways have the potential to give rise to similar phenotypes. For example, it has proven possible to generate obese and diabetic Drosophila; conversely, genetic manipulation can also generate lean and hypoglycemic phenotypes. From conserved circulating hormones to key enzymes, the fly is host to a variety of homologous, metabolically active signaling mechanisms. The world of Drosophila research has not only a rich history of developing techniques for exquisite genetic manipulation, but also continues to develop genetic methodologies at an exciting rate. Many of these techniques add to the cadre of experimental tools available for the use of the fly as a model organism for studying carbohydrate and lipid homeostasis.

Structure and expression of the gene encoding phosphofructokinase (PFK) in Drosophila melanogaster,7929140,,"The gene from Drosophila melanogaster that encodes phosphofructokinase has been isolated and its structure and expression characterized. Southern blots of genomic DNA, comparison of multiple clones, and in situ hybridization to salivary gland chromosomes indicate that the Drosophila genome contains a single copy of the gene which encodes phosphofructokinase (PFK) that is located at cytogenetic position 46D/E on the polytene map. Analysis of the gene structure reveals a single coding region that spans 6.5 kilobase pairs and is composed of eight exons and seven introns. Three developmentally regulated transcripts are generated through the use of alternative polyadenylation sites. Transcription initiation occurs at a single site. The pattern of transcript accumulation during development is similar to other genes of Drosophila which encode enzymes of the glycolytic pathway. Deficiency analysis of the 46D/E region has identified a lethal complementation group associated with reduced PFK activity, thereby establishing the vital role of PFK function in Drosophila.",1994,"P D Currie, D T Sullivan, P D Currie, D T Sullivan"

Understanding microcephaly through the study of centrosome regulation in Drosophila neural stem cells,32897294,10.1042/BST20200261,"Microcephaly is a rare, yet devastating, neurodevelopmental condition caused by genetic or environmental insults, such as the Zika virus infection. Microcephaly manifests with a severely reduced head circumference. Among the known heritable microcephaly genes, a significant proportion are annotated with centrosome-related ontologies. Centrosomes are microtubule-organizing centers, and they play fundamental roles in the proliferation of the neuronal progenitors, the neural stem cells (NSCs), which undergo repeated rounds of asymmetric cell division to drive neurogenesis and brain development. Many of the genes, pathways, and developmental paradigms that dictate NSC development in humans are conserved in Drosophila melanogaster. As such, studies of Drosophila NSCs lend invaluable insights into centrosome function within NSCs and help inform the pathophysiology of human microcephaly. This mini-review will briefly survey causative links between deregulated centrosome functions and microcephaly with particular emphasis on insights learned from Drosophila NSCs.",2020,"Beverly V Robinson, Victor Faundez, Dorothy A Lerit, Beverly V Robinson, Victor Faundez, Dorothy A Lerit"

      To identify and quantify if the generation of electricity by nuclear power plants produces an increase in background radiation that might affect the radioresistance of organisms that live in that area.
    

    
  


        Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Natural populations of two sibling species of Drosophila, D. melanogaster and D. simulans, living in the immediate vicinity of the Mexican Nuclear Power Plant in Laguna Verde were studied for 10 years. Collections of flies were made at two sites, one close to and one further from two reactors, during both the pre-operational and operational stages of the reactors.

      The data obtained indicate that in both sites, egg-to-adult survival was higher in D. melanogaster than in D. simulans. There was an increase in the egg-to-adult survival during the pre-operational period of one of the reactors and the possible causes are discussed. No differences were found between the two sites.

Otherwise the structure and predicted protein are very similar to those of other species. (2) There is a significant shift in codon usage, especially compared with that in D. melanogaster Adh. The most striking shift is from C to U in the wobble position (both third and first position). Unlike the codon-usage-bias pattern typical of highly biased genes in D. melanogaster, including Adh, D. willistoni has nearly 50% G + C in the third position.

High resolution mapping of candidate alleles for desiccation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster under selection,22130970,10.1093/molbev/msr294,"The ability to counter periods of low humidity is an important determinant of distribution range in Drosophila. Climate specialists with low physiological tolerance to desiccation stress are restricted to the tropics and may lack the ability to further increase resistance through evolution. Although the physiological adaptations to desiccation stress are well studied in Drosophila and other ectotherms, factors underlying evolutionary responses remain unknown because of a paucity of genetic data. We address this issue by mapping evolutionary shifts in D. melanogaster under selection for desiccation resistance. Genomic DNA from five independent replicate selected, and control lines were hybridized to high density Affymetrix Drosophila tiling arrays resulting in the detection of 691 single feature polymorphisms (SFPs) differing between the treatments. While randomly distributed throughout the genome, the SFPs formed specific clusters according to gene ontology. These included genes involved in ion transport and respiratory system development that provide candidates for evolutionary changes involving excretory and respiratory water balance. Changes to genes related to neuronal control of cell signaling, development, and gene regulation provide candidates to explore novel biological processes in stress resistance. Sequencing revealed the nucleotide shifts in a subset of the SFPs and highlighted larger regions of genomic diversity surrounding SFPs. The association between natural desiccation resistance and a 463-bp region of the 5' promoter region of the Dys gene undergoing allele frequency changes in response to selection in the experimental evolution lines was tested in an independent population from Coffs Harbour, Australia. The allele frequencies of 23 SNPs common to the two populations were inferred from the parents of the 10% most and 10% least resistant Coffs Harbour flies. The frequencies of the selected alleles were higher at all sites, with three sites significantly associated with the resistant Coffs Harbour flies.

A review of DDT resistance as it pertains to the 91-C and 91-R strains in Drosophila melanogaster,31685201,10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.06.003,"While insecticide resistance presents a challenge for those intent on controlling insect populations, these challenges have also generated a set of tools that can be used to ask fundamental biological questions about that resistance. Numerous species of insects have evolved resistance to multiple classes of insecticides. Each one of these species and their respective resistant populations represent a potential tool for understanding the molecular basis of the evolution of resistance. However, in-laboratory maintenance of resistant insect populations (and their comparative susceptible populations) suitable for asking the needed set of questions around the molecular consequences of long-term pesticide exposure requires a significant, in places prohibitive, level of resources. Drosophila melanogaster (hereafter referred to as Drosophila) is a model insect system with populations easily selected with pesticides and readily maintainable over decades. Even within Drosophila, however, few populations exist where long-term pesticide selection has occurred along with contrasting non-selected population. As such, the Drosophila 91-C and 91-R populations, which exhibit insecticide resistance to DDT (91-R), compared to a non-selection population (91-C), represent a unique resource for the study of high level DDT resistance. Moreover, with the availability of ""omics"" technologies over the past several decades, this paired population has emerged as a useful tool for understanding both the molecular basis of pesticide resistance and the molecular consequences of long-term pesticide exposure. In this review, we summarize the studies with these aforementioned populations over the past several decades, addressing what has been learned from these efforts.",2019,"Keon Mook Seong, Omprakash Mittapalli, John M Clark, Barry R Pittendrigh, Keon Mook Seong, Omprakash Mittapalli, John M Clark, Barry R Pittendrigh"

Sex differences in life span: Females homozygous for the X chromosome do not suffer the shorter life span predicted by the unguarded X hypothesis,29430636,10.1111/evo.13434,"Life span differs between the sexes in many species. Three hypotheses to explain this interesting pattern have been proposed, involving different drivers: sexual selection, asymmetrical inheritance of cytoplasmic genomes, and hemizygosity of the X(Z) chromosome (the unguarded X hypothesis). Of these, the unguarded X has received the least experimental attention. This hypothesis suggests that the heterogametic sex suffers a shortened life span because recessive deleterious alleles on its single X(Z) chromosome are expressed unconditionally. In Drosophila melanogaster, the X chromosome is unusually large (∼20% of the genome), providing a powerful model for evaluating theories involving the X. Here, we test the unguarded X hypothesis by forcing D. melanogaster females from a laboratory population to express recessive X-linked alleles to the same degree as males, using females exclusively made homozygous for the X chromosome. We find no evidence for reduced life span or egg-to-adult viability due to X homozygozity. In contrast, males and females homozygous for an autosome both suffer similar, significant reductions in those traits. The logic of the unguarded X hypothesis is indisputable, but our results suggest that the degree to which recessive deleterious X-linked alleles depress performance in the heterogametic sex appears too small to explain general sex differences in life span.",2018,"Martin Brengdahl, Christopher M Kimber, Jack Maguire-Baxter, Urban Friberg, Martin Brengdahl, Christopher M Kimber, Jack Maguire-Baxter, Urban Friberg"
Drosophila male sex peptide inhibits siesta sleep and promotes locomotor activity in the post-mated female,19793753,10.1098/rspb.2009.1236,"Quiescence, or a sleep-like state, is a common and important feature of the daily lives of animals from both invertebrate and vertebrate taxa, suggesting that sleep appeared early in animal evolution. Recently, Drosophila melanogaster has been shown to be a relevant and powerful model for the genetic analysis of sleep behaviour. The sleep architecture of D. melanogaster is sexually dimorphic, with females sleeping much less than males during day-time, presumably because reproductive success requires greater foraging activity by the female as well as the search for egg-laying sites. However, this loss of sleep and increase in locomotor activity will heighten the risk for the female from environmental and predator hazards. In this study, we show that virgin females can minimize this risk by behaving like males, with an extended afternoon 'siesta'. Copulation results in the female losing 70 per cent of day-time sleep and becoming more active. This behaviour lasts for at least 8 days after copulation and is abolished if the mating males lack sex peptide (SP), normally present in the seminal fluid. Our results suggest that SP is the molecular switch that promotes wakefulness in the post-mated female, a change of behaviour compatible with increased foraging and egg-laying activity. The stress resulting from SP-dependent sleep deprivation might be an important contribution to the toxic side-effects of male accessory gland products that are known to reduce lifespan in post-mated females.",2010,"R Elwyn Isaac, Chenxi Li, Amy E Leedale, Alan D Shirras, R Elwyn Isaac, Chenxi Li, Amy E Leedale, Alan D Shirras"
Organization and regulation of sex-specific thioredoxin encoding genes in the genus Drosophila,17701050,10.1007/s00427-007-0175-y,"Thioredoxins are small thiol proteins that have a conserved active site sequence, WCGPC, and reduce disulfide bonds in various proteins using the two active site cysteines, a reaction that oxidizes thioredoxin and renders it inactive. Thioredoxin reductase returns thioredoxin to its reduced, active form in a reaction that converts NADPH to NADP(+). The biological functions of thioredoxins vary widely; they have roles in oxidative stress protection, act as electron donors for ribonucleotide reductase, and form structural components of enzymes. To date, three thioredoxin genes have been characterized in Drosophila melanogaster: the generally expressed Thioredoxin-2 (Trx-2) and the two sex-specific genes ThioredoxinT (TrxT) and deadhead (dhd). The male-specific TrxT and the female-specific dhd are located as a gene pair, transcribed in opposite directions, with only 470 bp between their transcription start points. We show in this study that all three D. melanogaster thioredoxins are conserved in 11 other Drosophilid species, which are believed to have diverged up to 40 Ma ago and that Trx-2 is conserved all the way to Tribolium castaneum. We have found that the intriguing gene organization and regulation of TrxT and dhd is remarkably well conserved and identified potential conserved regulatory sequences. In addition, we show that the 50-70 C terminal amino acids of TrxT constitute a hyper-variable domain, which could play a role in sexual conflict and male-female co-evolution.",2007,"Malin J Svensson, Per Stenberg, Jan Larsson, Malin J Svensson, Per Stenberg, Jan Larsson"
Growth temperature and genetic variability of wing dimensions in Drosophila: opposite trends in two sibling species,11204971,10.1017/s0016672300004717,"Thirteen linear wing dimensions were measured in 10 isofemale lines of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans grown at seven constant temperatures from 12 to 31 degrees C. Within-line (environmental) variability, estimated by the within-line coefficient of variation (CVw), exhibited similar variation patterns in the two species, that is higher values at extreme (low or high) temperatures. The magnitude of variation was, however, greater in D. simulans, which appears to be more responsive to thermal change. A clear hyperbolic relationship between trait mean value and CVw was also observed in both species, arising from measurement errors which are relatively more pronounced on shorter traits. Genetic variability was analysed by considering both the genetic CV (CVg, evolvability) and isofemale line heritability (intraclass correlation). Both parameters provided independent information, as shown by a lack of correlation between them. Moreover, CVg was negatively correlated with trait mean value, while heritability showed a positive correlation. With respect to thermal environment, both parameters exhibited similar reaction patterns which contrasted the two species. Genetic variability in D. melanogaster followed a convex reaction norm, with higher values at extreme (high or low) temperatures, and this observation agrees with previous independent investigations. Surprisingly, D. simulans revealed an opposite pattern, with a maximum genetic variability in the middle of the range. Such data point to the danger of drawing general conclusions from the analysis of a single species.",2000,"A G Imasheva, B Moreteau, J R David, A G Imasheva, B Moreteau, J R David"
Evolutionary changes of nonlinear reaction norms according to thermal adaptation: a comparison of two Drosophila species,9436536,10.1016/s0764-4469(97)85020-2,"While the adaptive significance of discontinuous reaction norms is generally accepted, the evolutionary interpretation of continuous response curves remains speculative, and the occurrence of internal constraints is often suggested as an explanation of experimental observations. In Drosophila melanogaster, various morphometrical traits exhibit convex reaction norms to growth temperature, with a maximum value within the developmental thermal range. We compared a cold-adapted species (D. subobscura) with a mid thermal range at 16 degrees C, to the warm-adapted D. melanogaster (mid thermal range at 22 degrees C) for three different morphometrical traits: wing and thorax length in both sexes and ovariole number in females. Maximum value temperatures were ordered in the same way for the three traits in both species: ovariole number > thorax length > wing length. Significant differences were also observed between the two species for the curvature parameter of the quadratic adjustment. The major observation was a significant lateral shift in the reaction norms: maximum values were observed at much lower temperatures in the cold-adapted species than in the warm-adapted one. The parallelism between mid thermal range variation and the position of the maximum value strongly suggests an adaptive displacement of the response curves. Natural selection may thus act not only on trait mean values but also on phenotypic plasticity and on the shape of reaction norms.",1997,"B Moreteau, J P Morin, P Gibert, G Pétavy, E Pla, J R David, B Moreteau, J P Morin, P Gibert, G Pétavy, E Pla, J R David"

Here we describe the isolation of a member of the F-element family, termed Fex, which is transcribed in specific cells of the female and male germ lines and in various tissues during embryogenesis of D. melanogaster. Sequence analysis revealed that this element contains two complete open reading frames coding for a putative nucleic acid-binding protein and a putative reverse transcriptase. Functional analysis of the 5' region, using germ line transformation of Fex-lacZ reporter gene constructs, demonstrates that major aspects of tissue-specific Fex expression are controlled by internal cis-acting elements that lie in the putative coding region of open reading frame 1. These sequences mediate dynamic gene expression in eight expression domains during embryonic and germ line development. The capacity of the cis-regulatory region of the Fex element to mediate such complex expression patterns is unique among members of the long interspersed nucleotide element superfamily of retrotransposons and is reminiscent of regulatory regions of developmental control genes.",1996,"B Kerber, S Fellert, H Taubert, M Hoch, B Kerber, S Fellert, H Taubert, M Hoch"

Drosophila melanogaster tRNA(Tyr) genes contain introns of three size classes: 20 or 21 base pairs (bp) (six genes), 48 bp (one gene), and 113 bp (one gene). As in yeast, removal of the intron led to loss of psi 35 in the anticodon when transcription was assayed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. All Drosophila intron sizes supported psi 35 formation.

In mixed populations, simulans had an increased preference for this oviposition site, where melanogaster was at low frequency. D. simulans larvae utilized the lower half of the medium to a significantly greater extent than did melanogaster. At low density (5 pairs of parents) in pure species cultures, 68.7% of simulans pupae were on the medium surface. As parental numbers increased, this proportion decreased. The distribution of melanogaster pupae was quite different, with only 8 to 12% on the medium at all densities. But the remaining pupae tended to occur higher on the cylinder wall as parental numbers increased. The competitive interaction changed during the developmental period. At four and eight days after culture initiation, simulans appeared superior, while for total adult progeny production, melanogaster was slightly superior. These strans of the two species were not ecologically equivalent.",1971,"J S F Barker, J S F Barker"
EXPERIMENTS ON TOLERATION OF TEMPERATURE BY DROSOPHILA,19872060,10.1085/jgp.6.2.167,"1. Most wild stocks of Drosophila melanogaster can be bred indefinitely on banana agar at a temperature of 31 degrees C. There is no relation between the geographical origin of these stocks and their ability to tolerate this temperature. 2. A single wild stock has been found which will breed for only one generation at temperatures above 29 degrees C. The offspring hatched at 31 degrees C. will breed normally at 24 degrees C. This difference from other wild stocks is apparently genetic, but its genetic basis has not yet been worked out. 3. The mutant stocks of D. melanogaster tested by us will breed for only one generation at 31 degrees C. and their offspring at this temperature are also fertile at 24 degrees C. This condition is apparently a physiological effect of the presence of any of the mutant genes in a homozygous condition. 4. Similar tests indicate that wild stocks of D. virilis and Chymomyza procnemis will breed at 31 degrees C., while D. simulans, D. immigrans, and D. funebris will not. The last two species are northern forms not commonly found in the tropics. 5. Both male and female flies from mutant stocks hatched at 31 degrees C. produce offspring at this temperature if mated to flies hatched at 24 degrees C. Their germ cells are therefore capable of development, and the cause of their failure to develop at 31 degrees C. when inbred must lie either in the failure of the germ cells to reach each other or in the fertilization process itself.",1923,"H H Plough, M B Strauss, H H Plough, M B Strauss"
Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry-based detection of drugs and neurotransmitters in Drosophila brain,23915325,10.1021/ac401920v,"Capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry has been used to determine the in vivo concentrations of the neuroactive drug, methylphenidate, and a metabolite in the heads of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster . These concentrations, evaluated at the site of action, the brain, have been correlated with orally administrated methylphenidate. D. melanogaster has a relatively simple nervous system but possesses high-order brain functions similar to humans; thus, it has been used as a common model system in biological and genetics research. Methylphenidate has been used to mediate cocaine addiction due to its lower pharmacokinetics, which results in fewer addictive and reinforcing effects than cocaine; the effects of the drug on the nervous system, however, have not been fully understood. In addition to measurements of drug concentration, the method has been used to examine drug-dose dependence on the levels of several primary biogenic amines. Higher in vivo concentration of methylphenidate is observed with increasing feeding doses up to 25 mM methylphenidate. Furthermore, administrated methylphenidate increases the drug metabolism activity and the neurotransmitter levels; however, this increase appears to saturate at a feeding dose of 20 mM. The method developed for the fruit fly provides a new tool to evaluate the concentration of administered drug at the site of action and provides information concerning the effect of methylphenidate on the nervous system.",2013,"Nhu T N Phan, Jörg Hanrieder, E Carina Berglund, Andrew G Ewing, Nhu T N Phan, Jörg Hanrieder, E Carina Berglund, Andrew G Ewing"
A Drosophila model for the screening of bioavailable NADPH oxidase inhibitors and antioxidants,21312054,10.1007/s11010-011-0743-3,"NADPH oxidase is the major source of non-mitochondrial cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and also is reported to be a major cause of various diseases including atherosclerosis and hypertension. In order to screen a new curative reagent that can suppress NADPH oxidase activity, we developed a Drosophila melanogaster fly that would overexpress human Dual oxidase 2 (hDuox2), a member of the NADPH oxidase family, as a screening model. These flies (GMR-GAL4/UAS-hDuox2) had a high generation of ROS in the posterior region of the eye discs along with an easily recognizable rough-eye phenotype, which is an ideal and convenient marker for further screening steps. Moreover, the hDuox2-induced rough-eye phenotype can be rescued by feeding with a culture medium containing mulberry leaves (MLs), which reportedly have an antimetabolic effect. Some commercially available antioxidants such as quercetin-3-O-D-glucoside or quercetin-3-O-glucose-6''-acetate, or the naringin contained in MLs and other herbs, also have shown a similar suppressing effect on the rough-eye phenotype. Our results suggest that flavonoid glycoside is absorbed from the intestine and functions in the body of D. melanogaster as it does in mammalian models such as rats. Thus, the GMR-GAL4/UAS-hDuox2 fly line is a promising model for the screening of novel drugs such as NADPH oxidase inhibitors and/or antioxidants.",2011,"Nguyen Thi Tu Anh, Maiko Nishitani, Shigeharu Harada, Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Kaeko Kamei, Nguyen Thi Tu Anh, Maiko Nishitani, Shigeharu Harada, Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Kaeko Kamei"
Gene and protein expression of Drosophila Starvin during cold stress and recovery from chill coma,20303406,10.1016/j.ibmb.2010.03.002,"In Drosophila melanogaster, the sole member of the Bcl-2-associated anthanogene (BAG)-family proteins, called Starvin (Stv), has only been recently described. BAG proteins regulate a large range of physiological processes including life/death cell balance and stress response. The role of Stv has been poorly studied in the context of abiotic stress and particularly during and after cold stress. In this study we investigated the temporal expression of Stv gene and protein in adult flies during both the cold stress (up to 9 h at 0 degrees C) and the subsequent recovery phase (up to 8 h at 25 degrees C). Because BAG proteins can regulate positively and negatively the function of Hsp70/Hsc70, we also checked whether Stv expression was related to Hsp70 and Hsc70. Stv mRNA and Stv protein both showed a similar expression pattern: no modulation during the cold period followed by a significant up-regulation during the recovery period. A coordinated response of Stv and Hsp70 mRNA was observed, but not for Hsc70. Our findings indicate that Stv expression is part of a stress-induced program in D. melanogaster. It probably acts as a co-chaperone modulating the activity of Hsp70 chaperone machinery during recovery from cold stress. Finally our results support the suggestion that Stv and human BAG3 may be functional homologs.",2010,"Hervé Colinet, Ary Hoffmann, Hervé Colinet, Ary Hoffmann"
Inferring the strength of selection in Drosophila under complex demographic models,19033258,10.1093/molbev/msn270,"Transposable elements (TEs) constitute a substantial fraction of the genomes of many species, and it is thus important to understand their population dynamics. The strength of natural selection against TEs is a key parameter in understanding these dynamics. In principle, the strength of selection can be inferred from the frequencies of a sample of TEs. However, complicated demographic histories, such as found in Drosophila melanogaster, could lead to a substantial distortion of the TE frequency distribution compared with that expected for a panmictic, constant-sized population. The current methodology for the estimation of selection intensity acting against TEs does not take into account demographic history and might generate erroneous estimates especially for TE families under weak selection. Here, we develop a flexible maximum likelihood methodology that explicitly accounts both for demographic history and for the ascertainment biases of identifying TEs. We apply this method to the newly generated frequency data of the BS family of non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons in D. melanogaster in concert with two recent models of the demographic history of the species to infer the intensity of selection against this family. We find the estimate to differ substantially compared with a prior estimate that was made assuming a model of constant population size. Further, we find there to be relatively little information about selection intensity present in the derived non-African frequency data and that the ancestral African subpopulation is much more informative in this respect. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for demographic history and bear on study design for the inference of selection coefficients generally.",2009,"Josefa González, J Michael Macpherson, Philipp W Messer, Dmitri A Petrov, Josefa González, J Michael Macpherson, Philipp W Messer, Dmitri A Petrov"
A Drosophila DEG/ENaC channel subunit is required for male response to female pheromones,16129837,10.1073/pnas.0506420102,"Odorants and pheromones as well as sweet- and bitter-tasting small molecules are perceived through activation of G protein-coupled chemosensory receptors. In contrast, gustatory detection of salty and sour tastes may involve direct gating of sodium channels of the DEG/ENaC family by sodium and hydrogen ions, respectively. We have found that ppk25, a Drosophila melanogaster gene encoding a DEG/ENaC channel subunit, is expressed at highest levels in the male appendages responsible for gustatory and olfactory detection of female pheromones: the legs, wings, and antennae. Mutations in the ppk25 gene reduce or even abolish male courtship response to females in the dark, conditions under which detection of female pheromones is an essential courtship-activating sensory input. In contrast, the same mutations have no effect on other behaviors tested. Importantly, ppk25 mutant males that show no response to females in the dark execute all of the normal steps of courtship behavior in the presence of visible light, suggesting that ppk25 is required for activation of courtship behavior by chemosensory perception of female pheromones. Finally, a ppk25 mutant allele predicted to encode a truncated protein has dominant-negative properties, suggesting that the normal Ppk25 protein acts as part of a multiprotein complex. Together, these results indicate that ppk25 is necessary for response to female pheromones by D. melanogaster males, and suggest that members of the DEG/ENaC family of genes play a wider role in chemical senses than previously suspected.",2005,"Heping Lin, Kevin J Mann, Elena Starostina, Ronald D Kinser, Claudio W Pikielny, Heping Lin, Kevin J Mann, Elena Starostina, Ronald D Kinser, Claudio W Pikielny"

We employed the SMART in Drosophila melanogaster to evaluate the genotoxicity of surface waters collected from Caí sites receiving direct sewage discharge: from Montenegro (Km 52) and from São Sebastião do Caí (Km 78 and 80), and from two sites under the industrial influence (Km 13.6 and 18.6). The genotoxic analysis included three collections: March, June and September 1999, which were tested at crude sample and at 50 and 25% concentrations. Considering the industrial samples from Km 18.6 and 13.6, collected in March, June and September 1999, they were characterized as not having genetic toxicity. The urban samples collected in March--Km 52, 78 and 80--showed a significant increment in the frequencies of total spots. In Km 52 and 78 the genotoxic effect was associated to both mutational and recombinational events, although for Km 80 the increases observed were mainly related to the occurrence of homologous recombination. Moreover, the Km 80 crude sample from June and all the concentrations analyzed for Km 52 in September were also able to induce mitotic recombination. These effects were only observed in the ST cross, demonstrating the genotoxins present in the urban discharges act by direct interaction with the DNA of the somatic cells. The SMART in D. melanogaster was shown to be highly sensitive to detect genotoxic agents present in the aquatic environment, and must be better exploited for monitoring areas under anthropogenic discharges.",2005,"Viviane Souza do Amaral, Renata Medina da Silva, Maria Luiza Reguly, Heloisa Helena Rodrigues de Andrade, Viviane Souza do Amaral, Renata Medina da Silva, Maria Luiza Reguly, Heloisa Helena Rodrigues de Andrade"
In vitro evolution of preferred topoisomerase II DNA cleavage sites,9988773,10.1074/jbc.274.8.5227,"Topoisomerase II is an essential enzyme that is the target for several clinically important anticancer drugs. Although this enzyme must create transient double-stranded breaks in the genetic material in order to carry out its indispensable DNA strand passage reaction, the factors that underlie its nucleotide cleavage specificity remain an enigma. Therefore, to address the critical issue of enzyme specificity, a modified systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) protocol was employed to select/evolve DNA sequences that were preferentially cleaved by Drosophila melanogaster topoisomerase II. Levels of DNA scission rose substantially (from 3 to 20%) over 20 rounds of SELEX. In vitro selection/evolution converged on an alternating purine/pyrmidine sequence that was highly AT-rich (TATATATACATATATATA). The preference for this sequence was more pronounced for Drosophila topoisomerase II over other species and was increased in the presence of DNA cleavage-enhancing anticancer drugs. Enhanced cleavage appeared to be based on higher rates of DNA scission rather than increased binding affinity or decreased religation rates. The preferred sequence for topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage is dramatically overrepresented ( approximately 10,000-fold) in the euchromatic genome of D. melanogaster, implying that it may be a site for the physiological action of this enzyme.",1999,"D A Burden, N Osheroff, D A Burden, N Osheroff"
"The Drosophila cytochrome P450 gene Cyp6a2: structure, localization, heterologous expression, and induction by phenobarbital",9407006,10.1089/dna.1997.16.1345,"The cytochrome P450 gene Cyp6a2 from Drosophila melanogaster is located on the right arm of chromosome 2 at position 43A1-2 and comprises two exons separated by a 69-bp intron. Phenobarbital treatment of flies leads to a rapid increase in the level of CYP6A2 mRNA and to an increased production of the CYP6A2 protein. DNA from the Cyp6a2 promoter region was functional when linked to a luciferase reporter gene and transfected into D. melanogaster Schneider cells. Moreover, a dose-dependent induction of luciferase activity by phenobarbital indicated that elements necessary for phenobarbital induction are located within 428 bp of the translation start site. Heterologous expression of the CYP6A2 protein in lepidopteran cells infected with a Cyp6a2-recombinant baculovirus was observed by Western blotting of cell lysates and by spectral characterization of the reduced-CO complex of the P450. The CYP6A2 protein produced in this system metabolized aldrin and heptachlor to their epoxides and metabolized the insecticide diazinon by desulfuration to diazoxon and by oxidative ester cleavage to 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine. Metabolism in lysates of cells infected with recombinant baculovirus was greatly enhanced by the addition of purified housefly NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase and cytochrome b5. These results show that CYP6A2 catalyzes the metabolism of organophosphorus insecticides and they implicate Cyp6a2 overexpression in metabolic resistance.

Directional selection in lines founded from different parts of the phenotypic distribution of sternopleural chaetae number in Drosophila melanogaster,24232620,10.1007/BF00305837,Divergent directional selection lines were initiated from base populations founded from parents taken from different parts of the sternopleural chaetae distribution in a cage population of Drosophila melanogaster. Lines founded from parents taken from the central part of the distribution showed greater response and higher realised heritability than lines derived from parents with extreme high or extreme low chaetae number. The results suggest that centrally derived phenotypes have higher heterozygosity for chaetae factors than extreme phenotypes and that these factors have a large effect on the character.,1989,"D O Skibinski, N A Shereif, D O Skibinski, N A Shereif"

Effect of breeding structure on population genetic parameters in Drosophila,15020467,10.1534/genetics.166.2.779,"The breeding structure of populations has been neglected in studies of Drosophila, even though Wright and Dobzhansky's pioneering work on the genetics of natural populations was an attempt to tackle what they regarded as an essential factor in evolution. We compared the breeding structure of sympatric populations of D. melanogaster and D. simulans, two sibling species that are widely used in evolutionary studies. We recorded changes in population density and microsatellite variation patterns for 3 years in a temperate environment of southwestern France. Results were distinctively different in the two species. Maximum population levels in summer and in autumn were similar and fluctuated greatly over years, each species being in turn the most abundant. However, genetic data showed that D. melanogaster made up a continuous breeding population in time and space of practically infinite effective size. D. simulans was fragmented into isolates with a local effective size of between 50 and 350 individuals. A consequence of this was that, while a local sample provided a reliable estimate of regional genetic variability in D. melanogaster, a sample from the same area provided an underestimate of this parameter in D. simulans. In practical terms, this means that variations in breeding structure should be accounted for in sampling schemes and in designing evolutionary genetic models. More generally, this suggests the existence of differential reactions to local environments that might contribute to several genomic differences observed between these species.",2004,"Emmanuelle Gravot, Michèle Huet, Michel Veuille, Emmanuelle Gravot, Michèle Huet, Michel Veuille"

The study of Priapulus caudatus reveals conserved molecular patterning underlying different gut morphogenesis in the Ecdysozoa,25895830,10.1186/s12915-015-0139-z,"Background:
      
    

    
      The digestive systems of animals can become highly specialized in response to their exploration and occupation of new ecological niches. Although studies on different animals have revealed commonalities in gut formation, the model systems Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, which belong to the invertebrate group Ecdysozoa, exhibit remarkable deviations in how their intestines develop. Their morphological and developmental idiosyncrasies have hindered reconstructions of ancestral gut characters for the Ecdysozoa, and limit comparisons with vertebrate models. In this respect, the phylogenetic position, and slow evolving morphological and molecular characters of marine priapulid worms advance them as a key group to decipher evolutionary events that occurred in the lineages leading to C. elegans and D. melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In the priapulid Priapulus caudatus, the gut consists of an ectodermal foregut and anus, and a mid region of at least partial endodermal origin. The inner gut develops into a 16-cell primordium devoid of visceral musculature, arranged in three mid tetrads and two posterior duplets. The mouth invaginates ventrally and shifts to a terminal anterior position as the ventral anterior ectoderm differentially proliferates. Contraction of the musculature occurs as the head region retracts into the trunk and resolves the definitive larval body plan. Despite obvious developmental differences with C. elegans and D. melanogaster, the expression in P. caudatus of the gut-related candidate genes NK2.1, foxQ2, FGF8/17/18, GATA456, HNF4, wnt1, and evx demonstrate three distinct evolutionarily conserved molecular profiles that correlate with morphologically identified sub-regions of the gut.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The comparative analysis of priapulid development suggests that a midgut formed by a single endodermal population of vegetal cells, a ventral mouth, and the blastoporal origin of the anus are ancestral features in the Ecdysozoa. Our molecular data on P. caudatus reveal a conserved ecdysozoan gut-patterning program and demonstrates that extreme morphological divergence has not been accompanied by major molecular innovations in transcriptional regulators during digestive system evolution in the Ecdysozoa. Our data help us understand the origins of the ecdysozoan body plan, including those of C. elegans and D. melanogaster, and this is critical for comparisons between these two prominent model systems and their vertebrate counterparts.",2015,"José M Martín-Durán, Andreas Hejnol, José M Martín-Durán, Andreas Hejnol"
Drosophila americana as a model species for comparative studies on the molecular basis of phenotypic variation,23493635,10.1093/gbe/evt037,"Understanding the molecular basis of within and between species phenotypic variation is one of the main goals of Biology. In Drosophila, most of the work regarding this issue has been performed in D. melanogaster, but other distantly related species must also be studied to verify the generality of the findings obtained for this species. Here, we make the case for D. americana, a species of the virilis group of Drosophila that has been diverging from the model species, D. melanogaster, for approximately 40 Myr. To determine the suitability of this species for such studies, polymorphism and recombination estimates are presented for D. americana based on the largest nucleotide sequence polymorphism data set so far analyzed (more than 100 data sets) for this species. The polymorphism estimates are also compared with those obtained from the comparison of the genome assembly of two D. americana strains (H5 and W11) here reported. As an example of the general utility of these resources, we perform a preliminary study on the molecular basis of lifespan differences in D. americana. First, we show that there are lifespan differences between D. americana populations from different regions of the distribution range. Then, we perform five F2 association experiments using markers for 21 candidate genes previously identified in D. melanogaster. Significant associations are found between polymorphism at two genes (hep and Lim3) and lifespan. For the F2 association study involving the two sequenced strains (H5 and W11), we identify amino acid differences at Lim3 and Hep that could be responsible for the observed changes in lifespan. For both genes, no large gene expression differences were observed between the two strains.",2013,"Nuno A Fonseca, Ramiro Morales-Hojas, Micael Reis, Helder Rocha, Cristina P Vieira, Viola Nolte, Christian Schlötterer, Jorge Vieira, Nuno A Fonseca, Ramiro Morales-Hojas, Micael Reis, Helder Rocha, Cristina P Vieira, Viola Nolte, Christian Schlötterer, Jorge Vieira"
Estimation of fine-scale recombination intensity variation in the white-echinus interval of D. melanogaster,19504037,10.1007/s00239-009-9250-5,"Accurate assessment of local recombination rate variation is crucial for understanding the recombination process and for determining the impact of natural selection on linked sites. In Drosophila, local recombination intensity has been estimated primarily by statistical approaches, by estimating the local slope of the relationship between the physical and genetic maps. However, these estimates are limited in resolution and, as a result, the physical scale at which recombination intensity varies in Drosophila is largely unknown. Although there is some evidence suggesting as much as a 40-fold variation in crossover rate at a local scale in D. pseudoobscura, little is known about the fine-scale structure of recombination rate variation in D. melanogaster. Here we experimentally examine the fine-scale distribution of crossover events in a 1.2-Mb region on the D. melanogaster X chromosome using a classic genetic mapping approach. Our results show that crossover frequency is significantly heterogeneous within this region, varying approximately 3.5-fold. Simulations suggest that this degree of heterogeneity is sufficient to affect levels of standing nucleotide diversity, although the magnitude of this effect is small. We recover no statistical association between empirical estimates of nucleotide diversity and recombination intensity, which is likely due to the limited number of loci sampled in our population genetic data set. However, codon bias is significantly negatively correlated with fine-scale recombination intensity estimates, as expected. Our results shed light on the relevant physical scale to consider in evolutionary analyses relating to recombination rate and highlight the motivations to increase the resolution of the recombination map in Drosophila.",2009,"Nadia D Singh, Charles F Aquadro, Andrew G Clark, Nadia D Singh, Charles F Aquadro, Andrew G Clark"
Conservation of capa peptide-induced nitric oxide signalling in Diptera,15498959,10.1242/jeb.01255,"In D. melanogaster Malpighian (renal) tubules, the capa peptides stimulate production of nitric oxide (NO) and guanosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP), resulting in increased fluid transport. The roles of NO synthase (NOS), NO and cGMP in capa peptide signalling were tested in several other insect species of medical relevance within the Diptera (Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi and Glossina morsitans) and in one orthopteran out-group, Schistocerca gregaria. NOS immunoreactivity was detectable by immunocytochemistry in tubules from all species studied. D. melanogaster, A. aegypti and A. stephensi express NOS in only principal cells, whereas G. morsitans and S. gregaria show more general NOS expression in the tubule. Measurement of associated NOS activity (NADPH diaphorase) shows that both D. melanogaster capa-1 and the two capa peptides encoded in the A. gambiae genome, QGLVPFPRVamide (AngCAPA-QGL) and GPTVGLFAFPRVamide (AngCAPA-GPT), all stimulate NOS activity in D. melanogaster, A. aegypti, A. stephensi and G. morsitans tubules but not in S. gregaria. Furthermore, capa-stimulated NOS activity in all the Diptera was inhibited by the NOS inhibitor l-NAME. All capa peptides stimulate an increase in cGMP content across the dipteran species, but not in the orthopteran S. gregaria. Similarly, all capa peptides tested stimulate fluid secretion in D. melanogaster, A. aegypti, A. stephensi and G. morsitans tubules but are either without effect or are inhibitory on S. gregaria. Consistent with these results, the Drosophila capa receptor was shown to be expressed in Drosophila tubules, and its closest Anopheles homologue was shown to be expressed in Anopheles tubules. Thus, we provide the first demonstration of physiological roles for two putative A. gambiae neuropeptides. We also demonstrate neuropeptide modulation of fluid secretion in tsetse tubule for the first time. Finally, we show the generality of capa peptide action, to stimulate NO/cGMP signalling and increase fluid transport, across the Diptera, but not in the more primitive Orthoptera.",2004,"Valerie P Pollock, James McGettigan, Pablo Cabrero, Ian M Maudlin, Julian A T Dow, Shireen-A Davies, Valerie P Pollock, James McGettigan, Pablo Cabrero, Ian M Maudlin, Julian A T Dow, Shireen-A Davies"

The Dca gene involved in cold adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster arose by duplication of the ancestral regucalcin gene,21339509,10.1093/molbev/msr040,"The Drosophila cold acclimation gene (Dca) is involved in the adaptive response to low temperatures. This gene is upregulated at the transcriptional level when D. melanogaster flies are exposed 1 day to 15 °C. Dca (or smp-30) is a member of the SMP-30/Gluconolactonase/LRE-like family. In the current study, we characterized the members of this gene family in the 12 Drosophila species with available complete genomes sequences. Two paralogous genes, Dca and regucalcin, were identified in all the Sophophora subgenus species (9 of the 12 species), and their presence was further confirmed in three other species of the subgenus (D. subobscura, D. madeirensis, and D. guanche). However, only regucalcin was present in the species of the Drosophila subgenus (D. grimshawi, D. virilis, and D. mojavensis). The phylogenetic analysis and the molecular organization of Dca that is a nested intronic gene support that Dca arose by a duplication event from the ancestral regucalcin gene after the split of the Sophophora and Drosophila subgenera but before the Sophophora radiation. After the duplication event, the nonsynonymous fixation rate increased in the branch leading to Dca (but not to regucalcin), suggesting the neofunctionalization of the former duplicate. Thus, regucalcin would have maintained the ancestral gene function, and Dca would have acquired a new function likely related to Ca²⁺ homeostasis and cold acclimation. Molecular evolution of Dca has been affected by its implication in the adaptive response to cold temperatures. Indeed, the gene has evolved under stronger purifying selection in the temperate than in the tropical Sophophora species, as reflected by the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions. This result is consistent with functional constraints acting on the DCA protein to keep species adaptation to temperate climates. Dca and regucalcin also differ in their expression patterns. The expression profile of regucalcin is similar to that of the anterior fat body protein gene (AFP) of Sarcophaga peregrina and Calliphora vicina, which is also a member of the SMP-30/Gluconolactonase/LRE-like gene family. Sequence similarity and expression profile suggest that AFP and regucalcin are indeed orthologous genes.",2011,"Carlos E Arboleda-Bustos, Carmen Segarra, Carlos E Arboleda-Bustos, Carmen Segarra"
HSP90 associates with specific heat shock puffs (hsr omega) in polytene chromosomes of Drosophila and Chironomus,8306827,10.1007/BF00352313,"The heat shock protein HSP90, which is mainly cytoplasmic, has recently been reported to be present in the nucleus. We have found a specific chromosomal localization of HSP90 in different species of Drosophila and Chironomus using immunocytochemical techniques with different mono- and polyclonal antibodies for this hsp. HSP90 was found associated with heat shock-induced puffs at 93D and 48B in salivary gland chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila hydei, respectively. The localization of HSP90 to locus 93D occurred rapidly after the onset of heat shock and disappeared during recovery, concomitant with puff regression. The association of HSP90 with the 93D locus was strictly heat shock dependent as shown by the absence of HSP90 in puff 93D induced by either benzamide or colchicine. No specific nuclear staining was observed in unstressed control cells. HSP90 was also found in the temperature-induced telomeric Balbiani ring puffs (T-BRs) in Chironomus thummi and in one heat shock puff at I-1C in Chironomus tentans. Other heat shock puffs also appeared lightly stained with the HSP90 polyclonal antibody in both species of Chironomus. HSP90 was absent from the T-BRs when RNA synthesis was inhibited with Actinomycin D suggesting that the localization of HSP90 is dependent on transcription. Inhibition of protein synthesis did not prevent association of this hsp with the T-BRs, indicating that pre-existing HSP90 can associate with this locus. HSP90 did not associate with any telomeric chromosomal regions of unstressed cells. The present observations suggest that heat shock gene products such as HSP90 may somehow be involved in the regulation at the chromosomal level of other members of the heat shock gene family. Puffs 93D (D. melanogaster) and 48B (D. hydei) are equivalent and correspond to homologous gene loci (hsr omega) that have unusual features that distinguish them from other heat shock puffs. The binding of HSP90 at T-BRs and at puff I-1C in the genus Chironomus is the first demonstration, albeit indirect, of the existence of hsr omega analogous loci in species other than Drosophila.",1993,"G Morcillo, J L Diez, M E Carbajal, R M Tanguay, G Morcillo, J L Diez, M E Carbajal, R M Tanguay"
Evolution of Hox post-transcriptional regulation by alternative polyadenylation and microRNA modulation within 12 Drosophila genomes,21436120,10.1093/molbev/msr073,"Hox genes encode a family of transcriptional regulators that operate differential developmental programs along the anteroposterior axis of bilateral animals. Regulatory changes affecting Hox gene expression are believed to have been crucial for the evolution of animal body plans. In Drosophila melanogaster, Hox expression is post-transcriptionally regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) acting on target sites located in the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of Hox mRNAs. Notably, recent work has shown that during D. melanogaster development Hox genes produce mRNAs with variable 3'UTRs (short and long forms) in different sets of tissues as a result of alternative polyadenylation; importantly, Hox short and long 3'UTRs contain very different target sites for miRNAs. Here, we use a computational approach to explore the evolution of Hox 3'UTRs treated with especial regard to miRNA regulation. Our work is focused on the 12 Drosophila species for which genomic sequences are available and shows, first, that alternative polyadenylation of Hox transcripts is a feature shared by all drosophilids tested in the study. Second, that the regulatory impact of miRNAs is evolving very fast within the Drosophila group. Third, that in contrast to the low degree of primary sequence conservation, Hox 3'UTR regions within the group show very similar RNA topology indicating that RNA structure is under strong selective pressure. Finally, we also demonstrate that Hox alternative polyadenylation can remodel the control regions seen by miRNAs by at least two mechanisms: via adding new cis-regulatory sequences-in the form of miRNA target sites-to short 3'UTR forms as well as by modifying the regulatory impact of miRNA target sites in short 3'UTR forms through changes in RNA secondary structure caused by the use of distal polyadenylation signals.",2011,"Pedro Patraquim, Maria Warnefors, Claudio R Alonso, Pedro Patraquim, Maria Warnefors, Claudio R Alonso"
Ethanol tolerance and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH; EC 1.1.1.1) activity in species of the cardini group of Drosophila,10495885,10.1023/a:1018722202488,"Ethanol tolerance, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH; EC 1.1.1.1) activity, and tissue-specific expression were examined in species of the cardini group of Drosophila using D. melanogaster as a standard of comparison. In contrast to most fruit-breeding species, all cardini species examined, two from the cardini subgroup and five from the dunni subgroup, were ethanol sensitive (LC50 < or = 2.05%) and the mean ADH activity of males ranges from only 8 to 16% that of D. melanogaster AdhFF. Among all seven cardini species, there were small but significant differences in ethanol tolerance and ADH activity. Differences in enzyme mobility were in accordance with the proposed phylogeny for the dunni-subgroup species. ADH is expressed in the fat body and midgut. Males of D. acutilabella and of D. belladunni have significantly less ethanol tolerance and express less ADH activity than females in zymograms and histological preparations.",1999,"W V Colón-Parrilla, I Pérez-Chiesa, W V Colón-Parrilla, I Pérez-Chiesa"
Is Drosophila-microbe association species-specific or region specific? A study undertaken involving six Indian Drosophila species,28466298,10.1007/s11274-017-2261-2,"The present work aims to identify the microbial diversity associated with six Indian Drosophila species using next generation sequencing (NGS) technology and to discover the nature of their distribution across species and eco-geographic regions. Whole fly gDNA of six Drosophila species were used to generate sequences in an Illumina platform using NGS technology. De novo based assembled raw reads were blasted against the NR database of NCBI using BLASTn for identification of their bacterial loads. We have tried to include Drosophila species from different taxonomical groups and subgroups and from three different eco-climatic regions India; four species belong to Central India, while the rest two, D. melanogaster and D. ananassae, belong to West and South India to determine both their species-wise and region-wide distribution. We detected the presence of 33 bacterial genera across all six study species, predominated by the class Proteobacteria. Amongst all, D. melanogaster was found to be the most diverse by carrying around 85% of the bacterial diversity. Our findings infer both species-specific and environment-specific nature of the bacterial species inhabiting the Drosophila host. Though the present results are consistent with most of the earlier studies, they also remain incoherent with some. The present study outcome on the host-bacteria association and their species specific adaptation may provide some insight to understand the host-microbial interactions and the phenotypic implications of microbes on the host physiology. The knowledge gained may be importantly applied into the recent insect and pest population control strategy going to implement through gut microflora in India and abroad.",2017,"Kopal Singhal, Radhika Khanna, Sujata Mohanty, Kopal Singhal, Radhika Khanna, Sujata Mohanty"

Rates and patterns of chromosomal evolution in Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. miranda,16547107,10.1534/genetics.105.054585,"Comparisons of gene orders between species permit estimation of the rate of chromosomal evolution since their divergence from a common ancestor. We have compared gene orders on three chromosomes of Drosophila pseudoobscura with its close relative, D. miranda, and the distant outgroup species, D. melanogaster, by using the public genome sequences of D. pseudoobscura and D. melanogaster and approximately 50 in situ hybridizations of gene probes in D. miranda. We find no evidence for extensive transfer of genes among chromosomes in D. miranda. The rates of chromosomal rearrangements between D. miranda and D. pseudoobscura are far higher than those found before in Drosophila and approach those for nematodes, the fastest rates among higher eukaryotes. In addition, we find that the D. pseudoobscura chromosome with the highest level of inversion polymorphism (Muller's element C) does not show an unusually fast rate of evolution with respect to chromosome structure, suggesting that this classic case of inversion polymorphism reflects selection rather than mutational processes. On the basis of our results, we propose possible ancestral arrangements for the D. pseudoobscura C chromosome, which are different from those in the current literature. We also describe a new method for correcting for rearrangements that are not detected with a limited set of markers.",2006,"Carolina Bartolomé, Brian Charlesworth, Carolina Bartolomé, Brian Charlesworth"
Adaptation of gene loci to heterochromatin in the course of Drosophila evolution is associated with insulator proteins,32681087,10.1038/s41598-020-68879-2,"Pericentromeric heterochromatin is generally composed of repetitive DNA forming a transcriptionally repressive environment. Dozens of genes were embedded into pericentromeric heterochromatin during evolution of Drosophilidae lineage while retaining activity. However, factors that contribute to insusceptibility of gene loci to transcriptional silencing remain unknown. Here, we find that the promoter region of genes that can be embedded in both euchromatin and heterochromatin exhibits a conserved structure throughout the Drosophila phylogeny and carries motifs for binding of certain chromatin remodeling factors, including insulator proteins. Using ChIP-seq data, we demonstrate that evolutionary gene relocation between euchromatin and pericentric heterochromatin occurred with preservation of sites of insulation of BEAF-32 in evolutionarily distant species, i.e. D. melanogaster and D. virilis. Moreover, promoters of virtually all protein-coding genes located in heterochromatin in D. melanogaster are enriched with insulator proteins BEAF-32, GAF and dCTCF. Applying RNA-seq of a BEAF-32 mutant, we show that the impairment of BEAF-32 function has a complex effect on gene expression in D. melanogaster, affecting even those genes that lack BEAF-32 association in their promoters. We propose that conserved intrinsic properties of genes, such as sites of insulation near the promoter regions, may contribute to adaptation of genes to the heterochromatic environment and, hence, facilitate the evolutionary relocation of genes loci between euchromatin and heterochromatin.",2020,"Sergei Yu Funikov, Alexander P Rezvykh, Dina A Kulikova, Elena S Zelentsova, Lyudmila A Protsenko, Lyubov N Chuvakova, Venera I Tyukmaeva, Irina R Arkhipova, Michael B Evgen'ev, Sergei Yu Funikov, Alexander P Rezvykh, Dina A Kulikova, Elena S Zelentsova, Lyudmila A Protsenko, Lyubov N Chuvakova, Venera I Tyukmaeva, Irina R Arkhipova, Michael B Evgen'ev"
Coding region deletions associated with the major form of rDNA interruption in Drosophila,6796939,10.1093/nar/9.19.4997,"The nucleotide sequences at and around the termini of 5 kb type 1 interruptions in three separate clones of D. melanogaster rDNA repeats have been determined, and have been compared with the sequence of the corresponding region of an insertion-free rDNA repeat. All three interrupted rDNA repeats contain a small deletion of 28S rRNA coding material at the left coding/insertion sequence junction. A second deletion was found in one of the three clones, ad other aberrations were suggested by the results of restriction enzyme digestions of unfractionated rDNA. The termini of 5 kb type 1 rDNA insertions in D. melanogaster were also compared with the corresponding regions of 28S rDNA interruptions in D. virilis: the insertion site is identical in the two species, but the termini of the two species' interruptions show no homology. I sequenced a 1.1 kb region of the 5 kb type 1 D. melanogaster rDNA interruption that covers the sequences of the 1 kb and 0.5 kb insertions. There is 98% homology between the rightmost 1 kb of the 5 kb interruption and the sequences of the shorter insertions.

Expression of eukaryotic glycosyltransferases in the yeast Pichia pastoris,12770780,10.1016/s0300-9084(03)00072-5,"The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is often used as an organism for the heterologous expression of proteins and has been used already for production of a number of glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of N- and O-linked oligosaccharides. In our recent studies, we have examined the expression in P. pastoris of Arabidopsis thaliana and Drosophila melanogaster core alpha1,3-fucosyltransferases (EC 2.4.1.214), A. thaliana beta1,2-xylosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.38), bovine beta1,4-galactosyltransferase I (EC 2.4.1.38), D. melanogaster peptide O-xylosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.26), D. melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans beta1,4-galactosyltransferase VII (SQV-3; EC 2.4.1.133) and tomato Lewis-type alpha1,4-fucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.65). Temperature, cell density and medium formulation have varying effects on the amount of activity resulting from expression under the control of either the constitutive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) or inducible alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoters. In the case of the A. thaliana xylosyltransferase these effects were most pronounced, since constitutive expression at 16 degrees C resulted in 30-times more activity than inducible expression at 30 degrees C. Also, the exact nature of the constructs had an effect; whereas soluble forms of the A. thaliana xylosyltransferase and fucosyltransferase were active with N-terminal pentahistidine tags (in the former case facilitating purification of the recombinant protein to homogeneity), a C-terminally tagged form of the A. thaliana fucosyltransferase was inactive. In the case of D. melanogaster beta1,4-galactosyltransferase VII, expression with a yeast secretion signal yielded no detectable activity; however, when a full-length form of the enzyme was introduced into P. pastoris, an active secreted form of the protein was produced.",2003,"Monika Bencúrová, Dubravko Rendić, Gustáv Fabini, Eva-Maria Kopecky, Friedrich Altmann, Iain B H Wilson, Monika Bencúrová, Dubravko Rendić, Gustáv Fabini, Eva-Maria Kopecky, Friedrich Altmann, Iain B H Wilson"
The white gene controls copulation success in Drosophila melanogaster,28794482,10.1038/s41598-017-08155-y,"Characteristics of male courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster have been well-described, but the genetic basis of male-female copulation is largely unknown. Here we show that the white (w) gene, a classical gene for eye color, is associated with copulation success. 82.5% of wild-type Canton-S flies copulated within 60 minutes in circular arenas, whereas few white-eyed mutants mated successfully. The w + allele exchanged to the X chromosome or duplicated to the Y chromosome in the white-eyed genetic background rescued the defect of copulation success. The w +-associated copulation success was independent of eye color phenotype. Addition of the mini-white (mw +) gene to the white-eyed mutant rescued the defect of copulation success in a manner that was mw + copy number-dependent. Lastly, male-female sexual experience mimicked the effects of w +/mw + in improving successful copulation. These data suggest that the w + gene controls copulation success in Drosophila melanogaster.",2017,"Chengfeng Xiao, Shuang Qiu, R Meldrum Robertson, Chengfeng Xiao, Shuang Qiu, R Meldrum Robertson"
Comparative transcriptome analysis among parental inbred and crosses reveals the role of dominance gene expression in heterosis in Drosophila melanogaster,26928435,10.1038/srep21124,"We observed heteroses for body weight in Drosophila melanogaster after generating hybrids from three inbred lines. To better understand the mechanism for this phenomenon at the mRNA level, we compared the mRNA profiles of the parental and hybrid lines using high-throughput RNA-seq. A total of 5877 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found and about 92% of these exhibited parental expression level dominance. Genes in the dominance category were functionally characterized using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and the gene classifications offered by the Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium. The analysis identified genes associated with crucial processes such as development and growth in all three crosses. Functional assignments involving aminoglycan metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, and galactose metabolism are significantly overrepresented amongst the 215 common dominance DEGs. We conclude that dominance DEGs are important in heteroses in Drosophila melanogaster and contribute specifically to body weight heterosis.",2016,"Xianwen Wu, Rongni Li, Qianqian Li, Haigang Bao, Changxin Wu, Xianwen Wu, Rongni Li, Qianqian Li, Haigang Bao, Changxin Wu"
Closed loop tracked Doppler optical coherence tomography based heart monitor for the Drosophila melanogaster larvae,25924107,10.1002/jbio.201500007,"This paper presents a novel instrument for biosciences, useful for studies of moving embryos. A dual sequential imaging/measurement channel is assembled via a closed-loop tracking architecture. The dual channel system can operate in two regimes: (i) single-point Doppler signal monitoring or (ii) fast 3-D swept source OCT imaging. The system is demonstrated for characterizing cardiac dynamics in Drosophila melanogaster larva. Closed loop tracking enables long term in vivo monitoring of the larvae heart without anesthetic or physical restraint. Such an instrument can be used to measure subtle variations in the cardiac behavior otherwise obscured by the larvae movements. A fruit fly larva (top) was continuously tracked for continuous remote monitoring. A heartbeat trace of freely moving larva (bottom) was obtained by a low coherence interferometry based doppler sensing technique.",2016,"Mantas Zurauskas, Adrian Bradu, Daniel R Ferguson, Daniel X Hammer, Adrian Podoleanu, Mantas Zurauskas, Adrian Bradu, Daniel R Ferguson, Daniel X Hammer, Adrian Podoleanu"
In-vivo optical tomography of small scattering specimens: time-lapse 3D imaging of the head eversion process in Drosophila melanogaster,25471694,10.1038/srep07325,"Even though in vivo imaging approaches have witnessed several new and important developments, specimens that exhibit high light scattering properties such as Drosophila melanogaster pupae are still not easily accessible with current optical imaging techniques, obtaining images only from subsurface features. This means that in order to obtain 3D volumetric information these specimens need to be studied either after fixation and a chemical clearing process, through an imaging window--thus perturbing physiological development -, or during early stages of development when the scattering contribution is negligible. In this paper we showcase how Optical Projection Tomography may be used to obtain volumetric images of the head eversion process in vivo in Drosophila melanogaster pupae, both in control and headless mutant specimens. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of Helical Optical Projection Tomography (hOPT) as a tool for high throughput 4D-imaging of several specimens simultaneously.",2014,"Alicia Arranz, Di Dong, Shouping Zhu, Charalambos Savakis, Jie Tian, Jorge Ripoll, Alicia Arranz, Di Dong, Shouping Zhu, Charalambos Savakis, Jie Tian, Jorge Ripoll"
The winged-helix transcription factor JUMU is a haplo-suppressor/triplo-enhancer of PEV in various tissues but exhibits reverse PEV effects in the brain of Drosophila melanogaster,19301136,10.1007/s10577-009-9026-1,"Gene expression goes along with changes in chromatin structure and is regulated by chromatin-modifying factors. If genes are transposed from their euchromatic position to the vicinity of heterochromatin, their expression can underly a position effect variegation (PEV). In Drosophila melanogaster a few genes are known that function in a gene dose-dependent manner as haplo-suppressors and triplo-enhancers of PEV or vice versa. The gene jumeaux (jumu) encodes a winged-helix transcription factor of multiple regulatory functions. A novel PEV test system for Drosophila melanogaster reveals that JUMU behaves as a haplo-suppressor/triplo-enhancer in different larval and adult tissues, but surprisingly behaves in the reverse manner as a haplo-enhancer/triplo-suppressor in larval and adult brains. Like jumu, the Su(var)3-9 gene also behaves as a haplo-suppressor/triplo-enhancer, but in our test system does not show any PEV effect in the brains.",2009,"Annemarie Hofmann, Madeleine Brünner, Günter Korge, Annemarie Hofmann, Madeleine Brünner, Günter Korge"

Genomic and transcriptomic analyses in Drosophila suggest that the ecdysteroid kinase-like (EcKL) gene family encodes the 'detoxification-by-phosphorylation' enzymes of insects,32540344,10.1016/j.ibmb.2020.103429,"Phosphorylation is a phase II detoxification reaction that, among animals, occurs near exclusively in insects, but the enzymes responsible have never been cloned or otherwise identified. We propose the hypothesis that members of the arthropod-specific ecdysteroid kinase-like (EcKL) gene family encode detoxicative kinases. To test this hypothesis, we annotated the EcKL gene family in 12 species of Drosophila and explored their evolution within the genus. Many ancestral EcKL clades are evolutionarily unstable and have experienced repeated gene gain and loss events, while others are conserved as single-copy orthologs. Leveraging multiple published gene expression datasets from D. melanogaster, and using the cytochrome P450s-a classical detoxification family-as a test case, we demonstrate relationships between xenobiotic induction, detoxification tissue-enriched expression and evolutionary instability in the EcKLs and the P450s. We devised a systematic method for identifying candidate detoxification genes in large gene families that is concordant with experimentally determined functions of P450 genes in D. melanogaster. Applying this method to the EcKLs suggested a significant proportion of these genes play roles in detoxification, and that the EcKLs may constitute a detoxification gene family in insects. Additionally, we estimate that between 11 and 16 uncharacterised D. melanogaster P450s are strong detoxification candidates. Lastly, we also found previously unreported genomic and transcriptomic variation in a number of EcKLs and P450s associated with toxic stress phenotypes using a targeted phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) approach in D. melanogaster, presenting multiple future avenues of research for detoxification genetics in this species.",2020,"Jack L Scanlan, Rebecca S Gledhill-Smith, Paul Battlay, Charles Robin, Jack L Scanlan, Rebecca S Gledhill-Smith, Paul Battlay, Charles Robin"
Molecular evolution of sex-biased genes in Drosophila,15282334,10.1093/molbev/msh223,"Studies of morphology, interspecific hybridization, protein/DNA sequences, and levels of gene expression have suggested that sex-related characters (particularly those involved in male reproduction) evolve rapidly relative to non-sex-related characters. Here we report a general comparison of evolutionary rates of sex-biased genes using data from cDNA microarray experiments and comparative genomic studies of Drosophila. Comparisons of nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rates (d(N)/d(S)) between species of the D. melanogaster subgroup revealed that genes with male-biased expression had significantly faster rates of evolution than genes with female-biased or unbiased expression. The difference was caused primarily by a higher d(N) in the male-biased genes. The same pattern was observed for comparisons among more distantly related species. In comparisons between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura, genes with highly biased male expression were significantly more divergent than genes with highly biased female expression. In many cases, orthologs of D. melanogaster male-biased genes could not be identified in D. pseudoobscura through a Blast search. In contrast to the male-biased genes, there was no clear evidence for accelerated rates of evolution in female-biased genes, and most comparisons indicated a reduced rate of evolution in female-biased genes relative to unbiased genes. Male-biased genes did not show an increased ratio of nonsynonymous/synonymous polymorphism within D. melanogaster, and comparisons of polymorphism/divergence ratios suggest that the rapid evolution of male-biased genes is caused by positive selection.",2004,"Zhi Zhang, Tina M Hambuch, John Parsch, Zhi Zhang, Tina M Hambuch, John Parsch"
Relationship between expression of serendipity alpha and cellularisation of the Drosophila embryo as revealed by interspecific transformation,8287797,,"A dramatic reorganization of the cytoskeleton underlies the cellularisation of the syncytial Drosophila embryo. Formation of a regular network of acto-myosin filaments, providing a structural framework, and possibly a contractile force as well, appears essential for the synchronous invagination of the plasma membrane between adjacent nuclei. The serendipity alpha (sry alpha) gene is required for this complete reorganization of the microfilaments at the onset of membrane invagination. We compare here the structure and expression of sry alpha between D. pseudoobscura, D. subobscura and D. melanogaster. Interspersion of evolutionarily highly conserved and divergent regions is observed in the protein. One such highly conserved region shows sequence similarities to a motif found in proteins of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family. Four 7-13 bp motifs are conserved in the 5' promoter region; two of these are also found, and at the same position relative to the TATA box, in nullo, another zygotic gene recently shown to be involved in cellularisation. The compared patterns of expression of D. melanogaster sry alpha and nullo, and D. pseudoobscura sry alpha reveal a complex regulation of the spatiotemporal accumulation of their transcripts. The D. pseudoobscura sry alpha gene is able to rescue the cellularisation defects associated with a complete loss of sry alpha function in D. melanogaster embryos, even though species-specific aspects of its expression are maintained. Despite their functional homologies, the D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura sry alpha RNAs have different subcellular localisations, suggesting that this specific localization has no conserved role in targeting the sry alpha protein to the apical membranes.",1993,"S Ibnsouda, F Schweisguth, G de Billy, A Vincent, S Ibnsouda, F Schweisguth, G de Billy, A Vincent"

Distribution of transposable elements in Drosophila species,10483093,10.1023/a:1003718520490,"We present a global analysis of the distribution of 43 transposable elements (TEs) in 228 species of the Drosophila genus from our data and data from the literature. Data on chromosome localization come from in situ hybridization and presence/absence of the elements from southern analyses. This analysis shows great differences between TE distributions, even among closely related species. Some TEs are distributed according to the phylogeny of their host species; others do not entirely follow the phylogeny, suggesting horizontal transfers. A higher number of insertion sites for most TEs in the genome of D. melanogaster is observed when compared with that in D. simulans. This suggests either intrinsic differences in genomic characteristics between the two species, or the influence of differing effective population sizes, although biases due to the use of TE probes coming mostly from D. melanogaster and to the way TEs are initially detected in species cannot be ruled out. Data on TEs more specific to the species under consideration are necessary for a better understanding of their distribution in organisms and populations.",1999,"C Biémont, G Cizeron, C Biémont, G Cizeron"

Different amounts of sequences homologous to elements of 412, copia and 297 dispersed repeated gene families are found in the genomes of D. melanogaster embryonic and tissue culture cells. In general the amount of these sequences is increased in the cell lines. The additional sequences homologous to 412, copia and 297 occur as intact elements and are dispersed to new sites in the cell culture genome. It appears that these elements can insert at many alternative sites. We also describe a DNA sequence arrangement found in the D. melanogaster embryo genome which appears to result from a transposition of an element of the copia dispersed repeated gene family into a new chromosomal site. The mechanism of insertion of this copia element is precise to within 90 bp and may involve a region of weak sequence homology between the site of insertion and the direct terminal repeats of the copia element.",1979,"S S Potter, W J Brorein Jr, P Dunsmuir, G M Rubin, S S Potter, W J Brorein Jr, P Dunsmuir, G M Rubin"
The Drosophila Stock Centers and their implications for developmental biology,8645560,,"Mutations are central to functional analyses of genes and their products. In vertebrates, gene clones may be readily available, but there is often a lack of mutations. In Drosophila melanogaster, which has been used in genetic research for almost a decade, mutations defining thousands of genes have been isolated. Much of the basic genetic knowledge available today has been obtained from fundamental experiments done on the fruitfly. This year's Nobel laureates in physiology and medicine, E.B. Lewis, C. Nüsslein-Volhard and E. Wieschaus, were rewarded for their important contributions to our understanding of the genetic control of early embryonic development where they used Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. Such experiments often result in huge numbers of mutant strains that should be maintained to aid in the localization and functional analyses of new genes in the future. For this reason Drosophila Stock Centers have been established in Europe and North America. Japan is also planning to build an Asian Drosophila Stock Center. The objectives of Drosophila Stock Centers are to maintain strains with well characterized mutations, check their constitution and distribute strains together with information about their genetic defects to research groups around the world.

In the past decades, recombinant rabies virus glycoprotein (RVGP) produced in several expression systems has been extensively studied to be used as an alternative vaccine. The immunogenic characteristics of this protein depend on its correct conformation, which is present only after the correct post-translational modifications, typically performed by animal cells. The main challenge of using this protein as a vaccine candidate is to keep its trimeric conformation after the purification process. We describe here a new immunoaffinity chromatography method using a monoclonal antibody for RVGP Site II for purification of recombinant rabies virus glycoprotein expressed on the membrane of Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells.

Among them, the most sensitive receptors are the odorant receptors (ORs), which form cation channels passing also Ca2+. Here, we investigate if and how odor-induced Ca2+ signals in Drosophila melanogaster OSNs are controlled by intracellular Ca2+ stores, especially by mitochondria. Using an open antenna preparation that allows observation and pharmacological manipulation of OSNs we performed Ca2+ imaging to determine the role of Ca2+ influx and efflux pathways in OSN mitochondria. The results indicate that mitochondria participate in shaping the OR responses. The major players of this modulation are the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Intriguingly, OR-induced Ca2+ signals were only mildly affected by modulating the Ca2+ management of the endoplasmic reticulum.",2020,"Jan Lucke, Sabine Kaltofen, Bill S Hansson, Dieter Wicher, Jan Lucke, Sabine Kaltofen, Bill S Hansson, Dieter Wicher"
Oxidative stress caused by lead (Pb) induces iron deficiency in Drosophila melanogaster,31995880,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.125428,"Toxic elements exposure disturbs the homeostasis of essential elements in organisms, but the mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that Drosophila melanogaster exposed to Lead (Pb, a pervasive environmental threat to human health) exhibited various health defects, including retarded development, decreased survival rate, impaired mobility and reduced egg production. These phenotypes could be significantly modulated by either intervention of dietary iron levels or altering expression of genes involved in iron metabolism. Further study revealed that Pb exposure leads to systemic iron deficiency. Strikingly, reactive oxygen species (ROS) clearance significantly increased iron uptake by restoring the expression of iron metabolism genes in the midgut and subsequently attenuated Pb toxicity. This study highlights the role of ROS in Pb induced iron dyshomeostasis and provides unique insights into understanding the mechanism of Pb toxicity and suggests ideal ways to attenuate Pb toxicity by iron supplementation therapy or ROS clearance.",2020,"Zhi-Hua Liu, Jin Shang, Lailai Yan, Tian Wei, Ling Xiang, Hui-Li Wang, Jigui Cheng, Guiran Xiao, Zhi-Hua Liu, Jin Shang, Lailai Yan, Tian Wei, Ling Xiang, Hui-Li Wang, Jigui Cheng, Guiran Xiao"

Results showed that spiromesifen inhibited the growth and development of ovaries, reducing at the highest dose (LC25) the number of oocytes, the volume of basal oocytes and ovarian weight. Biochemical analysis revealed that the tested compound reduced the ovarian levels of carbohydrates and glycogen during the sexual maturation. Moreover, fecundity, fertility and number of descendants from parents that survived to the treatment of pupae were significantly reduced. The sex ratio determined indicated a significant decrease in treated series and males seemed more sensitive to spiromesifen than females.

"Dietary choices are influenced by genotype, mating status, and sex in Drosophila melanogaster",29938060,10.1002/ece3.4055,"Mating causes many changes in physiology, behavior, and gene expression in a wide range of organisms. These changes are predicted to be sex specific, influenced by the divergent reproductive roles of the sexes. In female insects, mating is associated with an increase in egg production which requires high levels of nutritional input with direct consequences for the physiological needs of individual females. Consequently, females alter their nutritional acquisition in line with the physiological demands imposed by mating. Although much is known about the female mating-induced nutritional response, far less is known about changes in males. In addition, it is unknown whether variation between genotypes translates into variation in dietary behavioral responses. Here we examine mating-induced shifts in male and female dietary preferences across genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster. We find sex- and genotype-specific effects on both the quantity and quality of the chosen diet. These results contribute to our understanding of sex-specific metabolism and reveal genotypic variation that influences responses to physiological demands.",2018,"M Florencia Camus, Chun-Cheng Huang, Max Reuter, Kevin Fowler, M Florencia Camus, Chun-Cheng Huang, Max Reuter, Kevin Fowler"
Effect of semolina-jaggery diet on survival and development of Drosophila melanogaster,26252611,10.1080/19336934.2015.1079361,"Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal model organism for developmental studies. This study tests the potential of semolina-jaggery (SJ) diet as a new formulation for bulk rearing of flies. Semolina and jaggery are organic products obtained from wheat endosperm and cane sugar, respectively. Semolina is a rich source of carbohydrates and protein. Jaggery has a high content of dietary sugars. Moreover, preparation of semolina jaggery diet is cost-effective and easy. Thus, the current study aimed to compare survival and developmental parameters of flies fed the SJ diet to flies fed the standard cornmeal-sugar-yeast (CSY) diet. SJ diet enhanced survival of flies without affecting fecundity; male flies showed increased resistance to starvation. A higher number of flies emerged at F2 and F3 generation when fed the SJ diet than when fed the control CSY diet. SJ diet did not increase fly body weight and lipid percentage. Therefore, SJ diet can be used for bulk rearing of healthy flies at par with the standard cornmeal-sugar-yeast diet.",2015,"Debarati Chattopadhyay, Joel James, Debasish Roy, Soumadeep Sen, Rishita Chatterjee, Kavitha Thirumurugan, Debarati Chattopadhyay, Joel James, Debasish Roy, Soumadeep Sen, Rishita Chatterjee, Kavitha Thirumurugan"

We examined if the mean courtship duration of male Drosophila melanogaster cycles rhythmically, and if mutations at the period locus influence courtship bout duration. We measured the courtship bout durations of the following: (1) wild type Canton-S (per+) males; (2) perL males; and (3)per(s) males. Rhythmicity of courtship bout duration could not be mathematically determined. Mean courtship bout duration did not differ among the three groups; thus, mutations at the period locus did not influence mean courtship duration.

Analyses of diallel crosses indicate that both activities are inherited additively, and coordinate control of expression is suggested by the significant positive correlation between the two activities. Electrophoresis and thermal denaturation studies failed to detect structural differences among lines with different levels of DIP-A activity. No characteristic level of activity could be associated with any DIP-A allozyme. Mapping experiments revealed the presence of activity modifiers that are in tight linkage with the structural gene, as well as those that manifest their effects from a distance. The maximum genetic distance between a high-activity effect on DIP-A and the structural gene was determined to be 0.029 map unit.

"The putative cell cycle gene, enhancer of rudimentary, encodes a highly conserved protein found in plants and animals",9074495,10.1016/s0378-1119(96)00701-9,"The enhancer of rudimentary gene, e(r), in Drosophila melanogaster encodes a protein, ER, whose function has been implicated in pyrimidine biosynthesis and the cell cycle (Wojcik et al. (1994) Genetics 138, 1163-1170). In order to identify conserved regions of the protein and potentially important functional domains, the e(r) gene was cloned and sequenced from two other insects (Drosophila virilis and Aedes aegypti) and three vertebrates (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Brachydanio rerio) and sequenced from a flowering plant (Arabidopsis thaliana). These sequences along with those of a nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans) exhibit a high degree of identity. ER of Drosophila melanogaster is 76% identical to the three vertebrate proteins, 49% identical to the nematode protein, and 40% identical to the plant protein. There is high evolutionary conservation among the vertebrates. The mouse and human proteins are identical and differ from that of the zebrafish by a single conservative amino-acid change (valine for isoleucine). A dramatic sequence conservation is seen in the position of the hydrophobic amino acids. Of the 27 positions occupied by hydrophobic amino acids in ER of Drosophila melanogaster, 25 of the corresponding positions in the human protein, 23 of the positions in Caenorhabditis elegans, and 20 of the positions in Arabidopsis thaliana have hydrophobic amino acids. Most of these residues are present in three conserved amphipathic alpha-helices, which are proposed to function in protein-protein interactions. Two phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II (CKII) have also been conserved within the animal groups. Purified ER from Drosophila melanogaster is phosphorylated in vitro by CKII, arguing that these two sites are functional in vivo. A putative shift in the secondary structure of ER caused by the phosphorylation of these sites suggests that CKII may be regulating the activity of the ER in vivo.",1997,"M Gelsthorpe, M Pulumati, C McCallum, K Dang-Vu, S I Tsubota, M Gelsthorpe, M Pulumati, C McCallum, K Dang-Vu, S I Tsubota"
Role of oxidative stress in Drosophila aging,1383769,10.1016/0921-8734(92)90031-j,"We review the role that oxidative damage plays in regulating the lifespan of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Results from our laboratory show that the lifespan of Drosophila is inversely correlated to its metabolic rate. The consumption of oxygen by adult insects is related to the rate of damage induced by oxygen radicals, which are purported to be generated as by-products of respiration. Moreover, products of activated oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and lipofuscin are higher in animals kept under conditions of increased metabolic rate. In order to understand the in vivo relationship between oxidative damage and the production of the superoxide radical, we generated transgenic strains of Drosophila melanogaster that synthesize excess levels of enzymatically active superoxide dismutase. This was accomplished by P-element transformation of Drosophila melanogaster with the bovine cDNA for CuZn superoxide dismutase, an enzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of the superoxide radical to hydrogen peroxide and water. Adult flies that express the bovine SOD in addition to native Drosophila SOD are more resistant to oxidative stresses and have a slight but significant increase in their mean lifespan. Thus, resistance to oxidative stress and lifespan of Drosophila can be manipulated by molecular genetic intervention. In addition, we have examined the ability of adult flies to respond to various environmental stresses during senescence. Resistance to oxidative stress, such as that induced by heat shock, is drastically reduced in senescent flies. This loss of resistance is correlated with the increase in protein damage generated in old flies by thermal stress and by the insufficient protection from cellular defense systems which includes the heat shock proteins as well as the oxygen radical scavenging enzymes. Collectively, results from our laboratory demonstrate that oxidative damage plays a role in governing the lifespan of Drosophila during normal metabolism and under conditions of environmental stress.",1992,"J E Fleming, I Reveillaud, A Niedzwiecki, J E Fleming, I Reveillaud, A Niedzwiecki"
Chromosome Preference During Homologous Recombination Repair of DNA Double-Strand Breaks in Drosophila melanogaster,31519746,10.1534/g3.119.400607,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are especially toxic DNA lesions that, if left unrepaired, can lead to wide-ranging genomic instability. Of the pathways available to repair DSBs, the most accurate is homologous recombination (HR), where a homologous sequence is used as a donor template to restore genetic information at the break site. While much of the biochemical aspects of HR repair have been characterized, how the repair machinery locates and discriminates between potential homologous donor templates throughout the genome remains elusive. We use Drosophila melanogaster to investigate whether there is a preference between intrachromosomal and interhomolog donor sequences in mitotically dividing cells. Our results demonstrate that, although interhomolog HR is possible and frequent if another donor template is not available, intrachromosomal donor templates are highly preferred. This is true even if the interhomolog donor template is less diverged than the intrachromosomal donor template. Thus, despite the stringent requirements for homology, the chromosomal location of the donor template plays a more significant role in donor template choice.",2019,"Joel Fernandez, Hanan Bloomer, Natalia Kellam, Jeannine R LaRocque, Joel Fernandez, Hanan Bloomer, Natalia Kellam, Jeannine R LaRocque"
Regulation of the X Chromosome in the Germline and Soma of Drosophila melanogaster Males,29734690,10.3390/genes9050242,"During the evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes, the sex-specific Y chromosome degenerates, while the X chromosome evolves new mechanisms of regulation. Using bioinformatic and experimental approaches, we investigate the expression of the X chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster. We observe nearly complete X chromosome dosage compensation in male somatic tissues, but not in testis. The X chromosome contains disproportionately fewer genes with high expression in testis than the autosomes, even after accounting for the lack of dosage compensation, which suggests that another mechanism suppresses their expression in the male germline. This is consistent with studies of reporter genes and transposed genes, which find that the same gene has higher expression when autosomal than when X-linked. Using a new reporter gene that is expressed in both testis and somatic tissues, we find that the suppression of X-linked gene expression is limited to genes with high expression in testis and that the extent of the suppression is positively correlated with expression level.",2018,"Eliza Argyridou, John Parsch, Eliza Argyridou, John Parsch"

Protein removal is mediated by an intracellular proteasome complex: an E3 ubiquitin ligase, the targeting component, is essential for function. FBXO7 encodes the F-box component of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase linked to familial forms of PPS. The Drosophila melanogaster homologue nutcracker (ntc) and a binding partner, PI31, have been shown to be active in proteasome function.

SUA, GA, GUA, and DHBA reduced the number of the three types of spot induced by MMC without decrease of survival.

I highlight recent advances made in the field and discuss the physiological outcomes and consequences of this process. Indeed, phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is important in shaping or remodeling tissues to maintain their integrity and specialized functions during development and wound healing. It also contributes to the development of inflammation and/or its resolution after an injury or infection. This perhaps explains why the molecular mechanisms of phagocytosis of apoptotic cells are redundant and complex in mammals and suggests why they appear to have been mostly conserved through evolution. Caenorhabditis elegans has already proven to be useful in genetically dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying phagocytosis of apoptotic corpses by 'amateur' neighboring cells.

Genotype-environment interactions and the estimation of the genomic mutation rate in Drosophila melanogaster,7886063,10.1098/rspb.1994.0166,"We have studied the relative fitnesses of three genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster in 50 environments. Two genotypes, the MA lines, had accumulated mutations in the absence of natural selection over 62 generations. The third was a related strain where selection had continued to act. The environments differed in three factors: parental density, dilution of the medium, and the temperature régime and medium composition. Our measure of fitness assessed fecundity and viability relative to a reference genotype. Both MA lines always had lower fitnesses than the selected line, but the difference increased dramatically with dilution of the medium and, especially, crowding. Under the most severe conditions, the performance of the MA lines approached 0. This increased difference in harsh conditions may be caused both by a uniform increase in the magnitude of deleterious effects of all mutations and by the exposure of mutations which are essentially neutral under benign conditions. If the second cause is important, previous experiments are likely to have underestimated the genomic deleterious mutation rate in Drosophila melanogaster more than previously thought.",1994,"A S Kondrashov, D Houle, A S Kondrashov, D Houle"

Immediately after this the larvae were divided into two batches, which were used for determining the GSH level and the induction of SLRL mutations respectively.

Ensuing exposure, the F0 (parent), F1, F2, F3 and F4 generation flies were screened for the aberrant phenotype. Flies exposed to ZnO NPs showed distinctive phenotypic changes, like deformed segmented thorax and single or deformed wing, which were transmitted to the offspring's in subsequent generations. The unique abnormal phenotype is evident of chronic toxicity induced by ZnO NPs, although appalling, it strongly emphasize the importance to understand NPs toxicity for safer use.",2017,"Avnika Singh Anand, Dipti N Prasad, Shashi Bala Singh, Ekta Kohli, Avnika Singh Anand, Dipti N Prasad, Shashi Bala Singh, Ekta Kohli"
[Baicalein prolongs the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster through antioxidation activity],29924517,,"In order to explore the anti-aging effect of baicalein, female Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism was used to study the effects of baicalein on natural aging model and aging models induced by hydrogen peroxide（H2O2） and paraquat. The bioinformatics approach was used to predict the possible target for the anti-aging activity of baicalein, and the target pathways were identified. The oxidative stress pathway was a focus in experiment. Baicalein at concentrations of 0.04 mg·m L-1 and 0.2 mg·m L-1 extended the mean and maximum lifespans in the natural aging model, and effectively reduced the damages of oxidative stress by H2O2 and paraquat. 31 senescence-related targets together with the oxidative stress pathway were modulated by baicalein. The experiments revealed that baicalein might delay aging process through attenuation of the oxidative stress response by decreasing the reactive oxygen species（ROS）, malondialdehyde（MDA） and oxidized glutathione（GSSG） in Drosophila melanogaster.",2016,"Dan-dan Duan, Li Gao, Ke-xin Wang, Xue-mei Qin, Yu-zhi Zhou, Guan-hua Du, Dan-dan Duan, Li Gao, Ke-xin Wang, Xue-mei Qin, Yu-zhi Zhou, Guan-hua Du"
"Integrative analysis of young genes, positively selected genes and lncRNAs in the development of Drosophila melanogaster",25470998,10.1186/s12862-014-0241-9,"Background:
      
    

    
      Young genes and genes under positive selection commonly contribute to adaptive phenotypic evolution. Early developmental stages are very important for establishing phenotypes, which might be helpful for studying the evolutionary patterns of these rapidly evolving genes.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here, we performed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify modules of co-expressed genes at different stages of Drosophila melanogaster development. We found that young genes, including duplicated, orphan, and young lncRNA genes, are significantly enriched among modules associated with specific developmental stages. In addition, genes undergoing rapid amino acid sequence evolution driven by positive selection showed a similar proportion of essentiality with other genes, and enrichment in modules for specific developmental stages.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our integrative analysis revealed important roles for the origin of new genes and rapid amino acid sequence evolution in development that may account for specific phenotype evolution in Drosophila melanogaster.",2014,"He-Qun Liu, Yan Li, David M Irwin, Ya-Ping Zhang, Dong-Dong Wu, He-Qun Liu, Yan Li, David M Irwin, Ya-Ping Zhang, Dong-Dong Wu"
Unusual flexibility of distal and proximal histidine residues in the haem pocket of Drosophila melanogaster haemoglobin,21305121,10.1039/b902059b,"Several pH-dependent low-spin ferric haem forms are identified in a frozen solution of the ferric ¹²¹Cys→Ser mutant of Drosophila melanogaster haemoglobin (DmHb1*) using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques. Different forms with EPR parameters typical of bis-histidine coordinated haem iron centers were observed. Strong pH-dependent changes in the EPR signatures were observed related to changes in the haem pocket. The pulsed EPR data indicate that both the distal and proximal histidine exhibit a large libration around the Fe-N(His) axis. The resonance Raman spectra of the CO-ligated ferrous form of Drosophila melanogaster haemoglobin are typical of an open conformation, with little stabilization of the CO ligand by the surrounding amino-acid residues. The EPR data of the cyanide-ligated ferric DmHb1* indicates a close similarity with cyanide-ligated ferric myoglobin.

Squash preparations of polytene chromosomes from salivary glands dissected out from third instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster were denatured and subjected to hybridization with a digoxigenin labeled probe, corresponding to mini-white gene. The preparations were then washed and incubated with anti-digoxigenin-fluorescein antibodies.

Temporal distribution of P elements in Drosophila melanogaster strains from natural populations in Japan,2174247,10.1266/jjg.65.277,"Genetic and molecular investigations were carried out with 10 Japanese Drosophila melanogaster strains on P-M system of hybrid dysgenesis. The strains used here were collected in the years from 1952 to 1984 from various natural populations, and have been maintained in our laboratory. The whole genomic Southern hybridization was performed by using the 2.9-kb P element and the internal fragments as probes. Five strains possessed no P element copy and the other 5 strains possessed mainly incomplete P elements which had internal deletions. The former 5 strains were M, 2 of the latter were Q, and the remaining 3 were M' strains. Hikone-R, collected in 1952, had no P element copy, while Hikone-H, collected in 1957, was the earliest observed to possess multicopies of an incomplete P element.

Intraspecific nuclear DNA variation in Drosophila,8583899,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025563,"We have summarized and analyzed all available nuclear DNA sequence polymorphism studies for three species of Drosophila, D. melanogaster (24 loci), D. simulans (12 loci), and D. pseudoobscura (5 loci). Our major findings are: (1) The average nucleotide heterozygosity ranges from about 0.4% to 2% depending upon species and function of the region, i.e., coding or noncoding. (2) Compared to D. simulans and D. pseudoobscura (which are about equally variable), D. melanogaster displays a low degree of DNA polymorphism. (3) Noncoding introns and 3' and 5' flanking DNA shows less polymorphism than silent sites within coding DNA. (4) X-linked genes are less variable than autosomal genes. (5) Transition (Ts) and transversion (Tv) polymorphisms are about equally frequent in non-coding DNA and at fourfold degenerate sites in coding DNA while Ts polymorphisms outnumber Tv polymorphisms by about 2:1 in total coding DNA. The increased Ts polymorphism in coding regions is likely due to the structure of the genetic code: silent changes are more often Ts's than are replacement substitutions. (6) The proportion of replacement polymorphisms is significantly higher in D. melanogaster than in D. simulans. (7) The level of variation in coding DNA and the adjacent noncoding DNA is significantly correlated indicating regional effects, most notably recombination. (8) Surprisingly, the level of polymorphism at silent coding sites in D. melanogaster is positively correlated with degree of codon usage bias. (9) Three proposed tests of the neutral theory of DNA polymorphisms have been performed on the data: Tajima's test, the HKA test, and the McDonald-Kreitman test. About half of the loci fail to conform to the expectations of neutral theory by one of the tests. We conclude that many variables are affecting levels of DNA polymorphism in Drosophila, from properties of nucleotides to population history and, perhaps, mating structure.

Enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism in Drosophila melanogaster,15666085,10.1007/s00018-004-4254-1,"Sphingolipids are important structural components of membranes that delimit the boundaries of cellular compartments, cells and organisms.

For well over a century Drosophila melanogaster has served as a useful model organism to understand some of the fundamental tenets of development, differentiation and signaling in eukaryotic organisms. Directed approaches to study sphingolipid biology in Drosophila have been initiated only recently. Nevertheless, earlier phenotypic studies conducted on genes of unknown biochemical function have recently been recognized as mutants of enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism.

Molecular Genetic Analysis of Ethanol Intoxication in Drosophila melanogaster,21676709,10.1093/icb/44.4.269,"Recently, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been introduced as a model system to study the molecular bases of a variety of ethanol-induced behaviors. It became immediately apparent that the behavioral changes elicited by acute ethanol exposure are remarkably similar in flies and mammals. Flies show signs of acute intoxication, which range from locomotor stimulation at low doses to complete sedation at higher doses and they develop tolerance upon intermittent ethanol exposure. Genetic screens for mutants with altered responsiveness to ethanol have been carried out and a few of the disrupted genes have been identified. This analysis, while still in its early stages, has already revealed some surprising molecular parallels with mammals. The availability of powerful tools for genetic manipulation in Drosophila, together with the high degree of conservation at the genomic level, make Drosophila a promising model organism to study the mechanism by which ethanol regulates behavior and the mechanisms underlying the organism's adaptation to long-term ethanol exposure.",2004,"Ulrike Heberlein, Fred W Wolf, Adrian Rothenfluh, Douglas J Guarnieri, Ulrike Heberlein, Fred W Wolf, Adrian Rothenfluh, Douglas J Guarnieri"

We identify, on a gene-by-gene basis, the evolutionary forces that shape this variation and show that, both within the transcriptional network that controls metamorphosis and across the whole genome, the expression changes of transcription factor genes are relatively stable, whereas those of their downstream targets are more likely to have evolved.

Restricted expression of a truncated adenylyl cyclase in the cephalic furrow of Drosophila melanogaster,10603085,10.1007/pl00008186,"We have identified a novel isoform of adenylyl cyclase, DAC78C, in Drosophila melanogaster that encodes two structurally distinct proteins in a developmentally restricted manner. The protein corresponding to one transcript is potently activated by G protein and protein kinase C and is expressed ubiquitously. The protein corresponding to the second transcript is expressed in a dynamic pattern in gastrulation stage embryos; it is restricted to the cephalic furrow and dorsal transverse folds, active regions of cell movement of unknown function in the Drosophila embryo. We propose that DAC78C and the cAMP pathway play an important role in directing these morphogenetic movements, and that this gene may provide clues to the functional significance of these structures in gastrulation.",2000,"M J Cann, L R Levin, M J Cann, L R Levin"

[Increased mitotic crossing over of heterochromatin in the first cleavage division of Drosophila melanogaster],7635319,,"It is shown that, although no compaction of paracentromeric heterochromatin occurs during the first cleavage division in Drosophila melanogaster, the frequency of mitotic crossing-over in corresponding chromosome regions is increased, as compared to that in euchromatin. Because a similar situation is observed at later stages of Drosophila development, at which compact chromatin regions become well-manifested, it is concluded that the effect of heterochromatin on the frequency of crossing-over does not depend on its packing. A positive correlation between crossing-over events in paracentromeric heterochromatin and euchromatin was observed. This effect is probably due to the formation of a continuous region of somatic synapsis, which facilitates the process of mitotic crossing-over. On this basis, it is proposed that the effect of heterochromatin on mitotic crossing-over is associated with preferential chromosome pairing in the corresponding regions.",1995,"L V Omel'ianchuk, E I Volkova, L V Omel'ianchuk, E I Volkova"

Visual place learning in Drosophila melanogaster,21654803,10.1038/nature10131,"The ability of insects to learn and navigate to specific locations in the environment has fascinated naturalists for decades. The impressive navigational abilities of ants, bees, wasps and other insects demonstrate that insects are capable of visual place learning, but little is known about the underlying neural circuits that mediate these behaviours. Drosophila melanogaster (common fruit fly) is a powerful model organism for dissecting the neural circuitry underlying complex behaviours, from sensory perception to learning and memory. Drosophila can identify and remember visual features such as size, colour and contour orientation. However, the extent to which they use vision to recall specific locations remains unclear. Here we describe a visual place learning platform and demonstrate that Drosophila are capable of forming and retaining visual place memories to guide selective navigation. By targeted genetic silencing of small subsets of cells in the Drosophila brain, we show that neurons in the ellipsoid body, but not in the mushroom bodies, are necessary for visual place learning. Together, these studies reveal distinct neuroanatomical substrates for spatial versus non-spatial learning, and establish Drosophila as a powerful model for the study of spatial memories.",2011,"Tyler A Ofstad, Charles S Zuker, Michael B Reiser, Tyler A Ofstad, Charles S Zuker, Michael B Reiser"
Drosophila Renal Organ as a Model for Identification of Targets and Screening of Potential Therapeutic Agents for Diabetic Nephropathy,30088447,10.2174/1389450119666180808114533,"Diabetic nephropathy is one of the major causes of kidney failure, accounting for ~44% of all cases.

Identification of genetic determinants and understanding their role in the progression of disease are essential for developing diagnostic tools and effective therapy. Drosophila melanogaster is a genetically tractable model organism and is being used for understanding the genetic basis of several human diseases. Drosophila has a well developed renal system and shares conserved developmental and functional processes with humans. Apart from similarities in renal system, type 1 and type 2 diabetes can be induced in Drosophila following mechanisms similar to those in human.

Metabolome analysis of Drosophila melanogaster during embryogenesis,25121768,10.1371/journal.pone.0099519,"The Drosophila melanogaster embryo has been widely utilized as a model for genetics and developmental biology due to its small size, short generation time, and large brood size. Information on embryonic metabolism during developmental progression is important for further understanding the mechanisms of Drosophila embryogenesis. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the changes in embryos' metabolome that occur at different stages of the Drosophila embryonic development. Time course samples of Drosophila embryos were subjected to GC/MS-based metabolome analysis for profiling of low molecular weight hydrophilic metabolites, including sugars, amino acids, and organic acids. The results showed that the metabolic profiles of Drosophila embryo varied during the course of development and there was a strong correlation between the metabolome and different embryonic stages. Using the metabolome information, we were able to establish a prediction model for developmental stages of embryos starting from their high-resolution quantitative metabolite composition. Among the important metabolites revealed from our model, we suggest that different amino acids appear to play distinct roles in different developmental stages and an appropriate balance in trehalose-glucose ratio is crucial to supply the carbohydrate source for the development of Drosophila embryo.",2014,"Phan Nguyen Thuy An, Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Takeshi Bamba, Eiichiro Fukusaki, Phan Nguyen Thuy An, Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Takeshi Bamba, Eiichiro Fukusaki"
RNAi is an antiviral immune response against a dsRNA virus in Drosophila melanogaster,16611236,10.1111/j.1462-5822.2006.00688.x,"Drosophila melanogaster has a robust and efficient innate immune system, which reacts to infections ranging from bacteria to fungi and, as discovered recently, viruses as well. The known Drosophila immune responses rely on humoral and cellular activities, similar to those found in the innate immune system of other animals. Recently, RNAi or 'RNA silencing' has arisen as a possible means by which Drosophila can react to a specific pathogens, transposons and retroviral elements, in a fashion similar to that of a traditional mammalian adaptive immune system instead of in a more generalized and genome encoded innate immune-based response. RNAi is a highly conserved regulation and defence mechanism, which suppresses gene expression via targeted RNA degradation directed by either exogenous dsRNA (cleaved into siRNAs) or endogenous miRNAs. In plants, RNAi has been found to act as an antiviral immune response system. Here we show that RNAi is an antiviral response used by Drosophila to combat infection by Drosophila X Virus, a birnavirus, as well. Additionally, we identify multiple core RNAi pathway genes, including piwi, vasa intronic gene (vig), aubergine (aub), armitage (armi), Rm62, r2d2 and Argonaute2 (AGO2) as having vital roles in this response in whole organisms.

"Preferential expression of biotransformation enzymes in the olfactory organs of Drosophila melanogaster, the antennae",10187818,10.1074/jbc.274.15.10309,"Biotransformation enzymes have been found in the olfactory epithelium of vertebrates. We now show that in Drosophila melanogaster, a UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT), as well as a short chain dehydrogenase/reductase and a cytochrome P450 are expressed specifically or preferentially in the olfactory organs, the antennae. The evolutionarily conserved expression of biotransformation enzymes in olfactory organs suggests that they play an important role in olfaction. In addition, we describe five Drosophila UGTs belonging to two families. All five UGTs contain a putative transmembrane domain at their C terminus as is the case for vertebrate UGTs where it is required for enzymatic activity. The primary sequence of the C terminus, including part of the transmembrane domain, differs between the two families but is highly conserved not only within each Drosophila family, but also between the members of one of the Drosophila families and vertebrate UGTs. The partial overlap of the conserved primary sequence with the transmembrane domain suggests that this part of the protein is involved in specific interactions occurring at the membrane surface. The presence of different C termini in the two Drosophila families suggests that they interact with different targets, one of which is conserved between Drosophila and vertebrates.",1999,"Q Wang, G Hasan, C W Pikielny, Q Wang, G Hasan, C W Pikielny"
Condensin I is required for faithful meiosis in Drosophila males,32314039,10.1007/s00412-020-00733-w,"The heteropentameric condensin complexes play vital roles in the formation and faithful segregation of mitotic chromosomes in eukaryotes. While the different contributions of the two common condensin complexes, condensin I and condensin II, to chromosome morphology and behavior in mitosis have been thoroughly investigated, much less is known about the specific roles of the two complexes during meiotic divisions. In Drosophila melanogaster, faithful mitotic divisions depend on functional condensin I, but not on condensin II. However, meiotic divisions in Drosophila males require functional condensin II subunits. The role of condensin I during male meiosis in Drosophila has been unresolved. Here, we show that condensin I-specific subunits localize to meiotic chromatin in both meiosis I and II during Drosophila spermatogenesis. Live cell imaging reveals defects during meiotic divisions after RNAi-mediated knockdown of condensin I-specific mRNAs. This phenotype correlates with reduced male fertility and an increase in nondisjunction events both in meiosis I and meiosis II. Consistently, a reduction in male fertility was also observed after proteasome-mediated degradation of the condensin I subunit Barren. Taken together, our results demonstrate an essential role of condensin I during male meiosis in Drosophila melanogaster.",2020,"Kristina Kleinschnitz, Nina Vießmann, Mareike Jordan, Stefan K Heidmann, Kristina Kleinschnitz, Nina Vießmann, Mareike Jordan, Stefan K Heidmann"
Functional analysis of glycosylation using Drosophila melanogaster,31773367,10.1007/s10719-019-09892-0,"The glycosylation of proteins and lipids has various essential roles in a diverse range of biological processes, including embryogenesis, organ development, neurogenesis, maintenance of homeostasis, immune response, and tumorigenesis. Drosophila melanogaster is one of the representative multicellular model organisms, which have many useful genetic manipulation tools; it is used in developmental biology as well as classical and molecular genetics. Glycobiology is not an exception and many studies using Drosophila have been performed in this field to clarify novel functions of glycans. Recently, genome-wide screening and functional analyses were performed in whole body, wings, eyes, neuromuscular junctions, and immune organs. Furthermore, detailed studies with Drosophila mutants of glycosyltransferases, nucleotide sugar transporters, and glycosidases revealed novel functions of N-linked glycans, glycosaminoglycans, glycolipids, and O-linked glycans including mucin type O-glycan, O-Fuc, O-Man, and O-GlcNAc.

A lysolecithin/fatty acid mixture promotes and then blocks neurotransmitter release at the Drosophila melanogaster larval neuromuscular junction,17293048,10.1016/j.neulet.2007.01.040,"The study of the effect of snake presynaptic neurotoxins with phospholipase A2 activity on nerve terminals has recently unveiled the inhibitory action of a lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC)/fatty acid mixture. We report here that these neurotoxins have no activity on Drosophila melanogaster nerve terminals. However, a 1:1 mixture of LysoPC and oleic acid induces an early increase, followed by an inhibition of both evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release. This effect is also induced by LysoPC alone. The present findings provide an indirect evidence that the lipid hemifusion-to-pore transition is a key event in neuroexocytosis in Drosophila. Moreover, these findings substantiate the use of LysoPC as a general agonist of membrane fusion at nerve terminals. This novel tool could contribute to the unraveling of the molecular steps involved in neuroexocytosis, particularly in Drosophila, where it is straightforward to combine it with electrophysiology and genetics.",2007,"Aram Megighian, Michela Rigoni, Paola Caccin, Mauro A Zordan, Cesare Montecucco, Aram Megighian, Michela Rigoni, Paola Caccin, Mauro A Zordan, Cesare Montecucco"
Functional senescence in Drosophila melanogaster,16024299,10.1016/j.arr.2005.04.001,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is one of the principal model organisms used for studying the biology of aging. Flies are well suited for such studies for a number of reasons. Flies develop to adulthood quickly, have a relatively short life span, and are inexpensive to house. Most of the fly genome has been sequenced, powerful genetic tools are available to manipulate it, and most fly genes have obvious homologues in mammals. While the majority of aging studies in flies have focused on regulation of life span, the fly is emerging as a powerful model system for investigating the biology that underlies age-related functional decline. Key to the use of flies in this way is the striking number of parallels between functional senescence in Drosophila and humans. Here, we review age-related functional declines in Drosophila, human correlates of these age-related declines, and common mechanisms that influence longevity and specific aspects of functional senescence in flies.",2005,"Michael S Grotewiel, Ian Martin, Poonam Bhandari, Eric Cook-Wiens, Michael S Grotewiel, Ian Martin, Poonam Bhandari, Eric Cook-Wiens"
Drosophila melanogaster: an insect model for fundamental studies of sleep,15817324,10.1016/S0076-6879(05)93041-3,"In 2000, Drosophila melanogaster joined the ranks of vertebrates and invertebrates with a defined behavioral sleep state. The characterization of this sleep state revealed striking similarities to sleep in humans: sleep in flies has both circadian and homeostatic components, it is influenced by sex and age, and it is affected by pharmacological agents such as caffeine and antihistamines. As in mammals, arousal thresholds in flies increase with sleep deprivation. Furthermore, changes in brain electrical activity accompany the change from wake to sleep states. Not only do flies and vertebrates share these behavioral and physiological traits of sleep, but they are likely to share at least some genetic mechanisms underlying the regulation of sleep as well. This article reviews the methods currently used to identify and characterize the Drosophila sleep state. As these methods become more refined and our understanding of Drosophila sleep more detailed, the powerful techniques afforded by this organism are likely to unveil deep insights into the function(s) and regulatory mechanisms of sleep.",2005,"Karen S Ho, Amita Sehgal, Karen S Ho, Amita Sehgal"
A model for studying Alzheimer's Abeta42-induced toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster,15234342,10.1016/j.mcn.2004.03.001,"Alzheimer's disease is a neurological disorder resulting in the degeneration and death of brain neurons controlling memory, cognition and behavior. Although overproduction of Abeta peptides is widely considered a causative event in the disease, the mechanisms by which Abeta peptides cause neurodegeneration and the processes of Abeta clearance and degradation remain unclear. To address these issues, we have expressed the Abeta peptides in Drosophila melanogaster. We show that overexpression of Abeta42 peptides in the nervous system results in phenotypes associated with neuronal degeneration in a dose- and age-dependent manner. We further show that a mutation in a Drosophila neprilysin gene suppresses the Abeta42 phenotypes by lowering the levels of the Abeta42 peptide, supporting the role of neprilysin in the catabolism of Abeta peptides in vivo. We propose that our Drosophila model is suitable for the study and elucidation of Abeta metabolism and toxicity at the genetic level.",2004,"Alyce Finelli, Anju Kelkar, Ho-Juhn Song, Haidi Yang, Mary Konsolaki, Alyce Finelli, Anju Kelkar, Ho-Juhn Song, Haidi Yang, Mary Konsolaki"

Although individual genes of the cytochrome P450 superfamily are highly diverged, the P450 reductase and cytochrome b(5) remain more conserved across taxa. Here, we describe the transformation of Drosophila melanogaster with a house-fly-specific cytochrome P450, CYP6D1. Functional activity of ectopically expressed cytochromes P450 requires successful interaction between the transgenic P450 and the requisite coenzymes of the host organism. Transformed Drosophila, but not controls, contained CYP6D1 protein as identified by protein immunoblotting, elevated total P450 and elevated CYP6D1 enzymatic activity. These data demonstrate that house-fly CYP6D1 can interact with low to moderate efficiency with Drosophila P450 reductase and cytochrome b(5).",2000,"P J Korytko, R J MacLntyre, J G Scott, P J Korytko, R J MacLntyre, J G Scott"
Molecular cloning and characterization of a putative cyclic nucleotide-gated channel from Drosophila melanogaster,10886412,10.1046/j.1365-2583.2000.00186.x,"We have cloned a cDNA encoding a putative cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel from Drosophila melanogaster. The N-terminal half of the predicted protein, designated as CNGL, shows a high degree of sequence similarity with the known CNG channel proteins. CNGL has a long hydrophilic C-terminal stretch that is absent in other CNG channels. Northern blot analysis revealed that the messenger RNA (mRNA) corresponding to the size of the cloned cDNA is expressed in Drosophila heads. Immunolocalization studies showed that CNGL is expressed in the brain, including the medulla, lobulla and lobulla plate, the antennal lobe glomeruli, and mushroom bodies.

A kinetic analysis of Drosophila melanogaster dopa decarboxylase,3081033,10.1016/0167-4838(86)90005-1,"The kinetic mechanism of dopa decarboxylase (3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine carboxy-lyase, EC 4.1.1.28) was investigated in Drosophila melanogaster. Based on initial velocity and product inhibition studies, an ordered reaction is proposed for dopa decarboxylase. This kinetic mechanism is interpreted in the context of measured enzyme activities and the catecholamine pools in Drosophila. The 1(2)amd gene is immediately adjacent to the gene coding for dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) and determines hypersensitivity to alpha-methyldopa in Drosophila. Dopa decarboxylase does not decarboxylate alpha-methyldopa and hence does not generate a toxic product capable of inhibiting 1(2)amd gene function. We propose that the 1(2)amd gene is involved with an unknown catecholamine pathway involving dopa but not dopamine.",1986,"B C Black, J Smarrelli Jr, B C Black, J Smarrelli Jr"

Evolutionary conservation of many elements of the insulin/IGF signaling network makes it possible to study the basic genetic function of this pathway in lower metazoan models such as Drosophila. Here we report the cloning and characterization of the gene for Drosophila insulin/relaxin-like peptide (DIRLP). The predicted protein structure of DIRLP greatly resembles typical insulin structure and contains features that differentiate it from the Drosophila juvenile hormone, another member of the insulin family. The Dirlp gene is represented as a single copy in the Drosophila melanogaster genome (compared to multiple copies for Drosophila juvenile hormone) and shows evolutionary conservation of genetic structure. The gene was mapped to the Drosophila chromosome 3, region 67D2. In situ hybridization of whole-mount Drosophila embryos with Dirlp antisense RNA probe reveals early embryonic mesodermal/ventral furrow expression pattern, consistent with earlier observation of the insulin protein immunoreactivity in Drosophila embryos. The in situ hybridization pattern was found to be identical to that obtained during immunohistochemistry analysis of the Drosophila embryos using various insulin monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies that do not recognize Drosophila juvenile hormone, supporting the idea that Dirlp is a possible Drosophila insulin ortholog.

In contrast, genes inserted in autosomal heterochromatin generally did not show imprint-regulated expression. The imprints were established on Y-linked transgenes inserted into many different sequences and locations.

Purified recombinant Tehao interacted specifically in vitro not only with the Pelle protein kinase, but also with the Toll intracytoplasmic domain. Remarkably, Tehao was found to activate Dorsal-dependent transcription in a synergistic manner with Toll, as well as Pelle in co-transfected cells.

"Selection, recombination and demographic history in Drosophila miranda",17028331,10.1534/genetics.106.062760,"Selection, recombination, and the demographic history of a species can all have profound effects on genomewide patterns of variability. To assess the impact of these forces in the genome of Drosophila miranda, we examine polymorphism and divergence patterns at 62 loci scattered across the genome. In accordance with recent findings in D. melanogaster, we find that noncoding DNA generally evolves more slowly than synonymous sites, that the distribution of polymorphism frequencies in noncoding DNA is significantly skewed toward rare variants relative to synonymous sites, and that long introns evolve significantly slower than short introns or synonymous sites. These observations suggest that most noncoding DNA is functionally constrained and evolving under purifying selection. However, in contrast to findings in the D. melanogaster species group, we find little evidence of adaptive evolution acting on either coding or noncoding sequences in D. miranda. Levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in D. miranda are comparable to those observed in D. melanogaster, but vary considerably among chromosomes. These patterns suggest a significantly lower rate of recombination on autosomes, possibly due to the presence of polymorphic autosomal inversions and/or differences in chromosome sizes. All chromosomes show significant departures from the standard neutral model, including too much heterogeneity in synonymous site polymorphism relative to divergence among loci and a general excess of rare synonymous polymorphisms. These departures from neutral equilibrium expectations are discussed in the context of nonequilibrium models of demography and selection.",2006,"Doris Bachtrog, Peter Andolfatto, Doris Bachtrog, Peter Andolfatto"

Micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography-electrochemical detection for analysis of biogenic amines in Drosophila melanogaster,14632107,10.1021/ac034219i,"Micellar electrokinetic chromatography coupled to amperometric electrochemical detection was used to investigate the chemical environment of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Preliminary studies focused on the employment and optimization of the system to separate electroactive amine-containing molecules present in the head and body of male and female flies. Ultimately, biogenic amines significant to the fly including L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, dopamine, tyramine, and serotonin were identified and their relative abundance quantified. Transgenic Drosophila with functionally ablated dopamine and serotonin neurons were analyzed to demonstrate the sensitivity of the technique. The separation method developed in this study should offer an advantage in elucidating the critical role that electroactive biogenic amines play in complex physiological processes correlated with Drosophila behavior.",2003,"Paula J Ream, Steven W Suljak, Andrew G Ewing, Kyung-An Han, Paula J Ream, Steven W Suljak, Andrew G Ewing, Kyung-An Han"
The flexible fly: experience-dependent development of complex behaviors in Drosophila melanogaster,7964407,,"We demonstrate that Drosophila melanogaster provides a rich model system for studying behavioral development. Two additions to the many well-known advantages of this species are exploited here. First, as in mammals and higher vertebrates, early experience affects behavioral development of Drosophila. Second, the affected behaviors are complex and yet readily studied in the laboratory. Thus, Drosophila can be used to study the developmental mechanisms by which organisms can optimize their behavioral repertoires to enhance their chances for survival. Evidence that early experience affects female responsiveness to courting males is reviewed; in each case, experience modifies responses to behavioral targets. Our results demonstrate that developmental plasticity allows adjustment of intrinsically determined responses to visual targets so that they can take into account the actual characteristics of the developing animal's environment. Furthermore, plasticity makes it possible to introduce 'cultural' and 'social' elements into courtship and mate choice in insects. This previously unrecognized role for developmental plasticity in insects has broad theoretical and practical implications.",1994,"H V Hirsch, L Tompkins, H V Hirsch, L Tompkins"
Developmental toxicity of ethanol in Drosophila melanogaster,3118495,10.1002/tera.1420360107,"Ethanol was tested for teratogenicity in Drosophila melanogaster. Treatment consisted of rearing the fly larvae in media containing initial ethanol concentrations of 0%, 4%, 8%, or 14% by weight. Emerging flies were inspected for gross malformations. A low frequency of malformations was seen among controls (0.82%), increasing to 10.36% of emerging adults at the highest ethanol dose. The most common malformation involved the legs (segments missing or distorted or complete absence) and wings (uninflated, distorted, or absent). Less frequent defects included fused or missing mouth parts and missing halteres. Also, by exposing staged larvae to ethanol and examining the emerging flies, developmental stage sensitivity of Drosophila was investigated in terms of timing of treatment initiation. The results suggested that the incidence of defects increased with length of exposure. These results support the assumption that ethanol itself is the causative agent in ethanol-induced developmental toxicity and further support the use of Drosophila for developmental toxicity screening.",1987,"S Ranganathan, D G Davis, R D Hood, S Ranganathan, D G Davis, R D Hood"

This review compares and contrasts the local regulation of GSCs by their specialized microenvironments, or niches; discusses how diet and diet-dependent factors, mating, and microorganisms modulate GSCs and their developing progeny; and briefly describes the tie between physiology and development during the larval phase of the germline cycle.

GABAA receptor-expressing neurons promote consumption in Drosophila melanogaster,28362856,10.1371/journal.pone.0175177,"Feeding decisions are highly plastic and bidirectionally regulated by neurons that either promote or inhibit feeding. In Drosophila melanogaster, recent studies have identified four GABAergic interneurons that act as critical brakes to prevent incessant feeding. These GABAergic neurons may inhibit target neurons that drive consumption. Here, we tested this hypothesis by examining GABA receptors and neurons that promote consumption. We find that Resistance to dieldrin (RDL), a GABAA type receptor, is required for proper control of ingestion. Knockdown of Rdl in a subset of neurons causes overconsumption of tastants. Acute activation of these neurons is sufficient to drive consumption of appetitive substances and non-appetitive substances and acute silencing of these neurons decreases consumption. Taken together, these studies identify GABAA receptor-expressing neurons that promote Drosophila ingestive behavior and provide insight into feeding regulation.",2017,"Samantha K Cheung, Kristin Scott, Samantha K Cheung, Kristin Scott"

Adult male and female fruit flies showed attraction to odours emanating from foraging larvae, and females preferred to lay eggs on food patches occupied by larvae over similar unoccupied patches. Females learned and subsequently preferred to lay eggs at patches with novel flavours previously associated with feeding larvae over patches with novel flavours previously associated with no larvae. However, when we controlled for the duration of exposure to each flavoured patch, females no longer preferred the flavour previously associated with feeding larvae.

This holidic diet supports development over multiple generations but at a reduced rate. Over 7 years of experiments, the holidic diet yielded more consistent experimental outcomes than did oligidic food for egg laying by females.

Predatory cannibalism in Drosophila melanogaster larvae,23653201,10.1038/ncomms2744,"Hunting live prey is risky and thought to require specialized adaptations. Therefore, observations of predatory cannibalism in otherwise non-carnivorous animals raise questions about its function, adaptive significance and evolutionary potential. Here we document predatory cannibalism on larger conspecifics in Drosophila melanogaster larvae and address its evolutionary significance. We found that under crowded laboratory conditions younger larvae regularly attack and consume 'wandering-stage' conspecifics, forming aggregations mediated by chemical cues from the attacked victim. Nutrition gained this way can be significant: an exclusively cannibalistic diet was sufficient for normal development from eggs to fertile adults. Cannibalistic diet also induced plasticity of larval mouth parts. Finally, during 118 generations of experimental evolution, replicated populations maintained under larval malnutrition evolved enhanced propensity towards cannibalism. These results suggest that, at least under laboratory conditions, predation on conspecifics in Drosophila is a functional, adaptive behaviour, which can rapidly evolve in response to nutritional conditions.",2013,"Roshan K Vijendravarma, Sunitha Narasimha, Tadeusz J Kawecki, Roshan K Vijendravarma, Sunitha Narasimha, Tadeusz J Kawecki"

Citronellal-induced activity is isoform-dependent for Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae TRPA1s.

Behavioral assessment of lines of Drosophila melanogaster selected for central excitation,3939662,10.1037//0735-7044.99.2.323,"Selected lines of Drosophila melanogaster, bred for high and low levels of central excitatory state (CES), were used in experiments to assess the effects of artificial selection on CES expression and to identify other correlated traits that may have become manifest during selection. Results indicate that the selected lines display (a) different levels of CES, (b) differences in water responsiveness (possibly due to differences in dehydration rates), (c) no water-induced CES, and (d) no significant amounts of sensitization or conditioning. Also, CES in the high line is not dissipated by subsequent posttest stimulations. Comparing the characteristics of CES in Drosophila and in Phormia regina reveals significant species differences. The relevance to earlier P. regina work with respect to CES and conditioning is discussed.",1985,"M Vargo, J Hirsch, M Vargo, J Hirsch"
"Beta-hydroxy-alpha-ketobutyric acid in Drosophila melanogaster, with reference to biosynthesis of drosopterins",6770911,10.1016/0304-4165(80)90140-3,"A substance designated as compound D, which reacts spontaneously with 7,8-dihydropterin to give drosopterins, is found in Drosophila melanogaster. The compound was partially purified from the extract of flies by column chromatography and identified as beta-hydroxy-alpha-ketobutyric acid by analysis of its 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, mass spectrometry and reactivity with 7,8-dihydropterin. A highly significant correlation (r=0.969, p less than 0.001) was found between the amounts of the compound and drosopterins in the eye-pigment mutants of Drosophila. Changes of the compound during development of flies were also closely related to those of drosopterins. Based on these observations, a role of the compound in biosynthesis of drosopterins has been discussed.",1980,"M Masada, M Akino, M Masada, M Akino"
Abnormal oogenesis and embryogenesis resulting from centrifuging Drosophila melanogaster females,410902,,"Females of Drosophila melanogaster were centrifuged at 2400 g and 4200 g for 3 h in a number of different orientations. The oocytes in various stages of vitellogenesis become separated into three layers; a centrifugal yolk layer, a central cytoplasmic layer, and a centripetal lipid layer. The direction of layering is related to the orientation of the female. The process of recovery of the ovaries was followed and the development of the eggs laid analysed. Many of the eggs laid over the subsequent 3 days die very early in development and fail to produce any differentiated structures. Some hatch into normal larvae and others produce defective embryos. The most common defect being a misarrangement of the segmentation. The differences in the kinds of experimentally inducible pattern aberrations in Drosophila and other diptera is discussed.",1977,"M Bownes, M Bownes"
Transport defects as the physiological basis for eye color mutants of Drosophila melanogaster,812484,10.1007/BF00484918,"Kynurenine-H3 transport and conversion to 3-hydroxykynurenine were studied in organ culture using the Malpighian tubules and developing eyes from wild type and the eye color mutants w, st, ltd, ca, and cn of Drosophila melanogaster. Malpighian tubules from wild type have the ability to concentrate kynurenine and convert it to 3-hydroxykynurenine. The tubules from w, st, ltd, and ca are deficient in the ability to transport kynurenine, as are the eyes of the mutants w, st, and ltd. This defect in kynurenine transport provides a physiological explanation for the phenotypic properties of the mutants. The relationship of these measurements to previous observations on these eye color mutants is discussed and the transport defect hypothesis is consistently supported. We have concluded that several of the eye color mutants in Drosophila are transport mutants.",1975,"D T Sullivan, M C Sullivan, D T Sullivan, M C Sullivan"
Genes and neural circuits for sleep of the fruit fly,28438481,10.1016/j.neures.2017.04.010,"Sleep is a universal physiological state evolutionarily conserved among species, but the molecular basis for its regulation is still largely unknown. Due to its electroencephalogram criteria, sleep has long been investigated and described mostly in mammalian species. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has emerged as a genetic model organism for studying sleep. The Drosophila sleep is behaviorally defined, and is tightly regulated by circadian and homeostatic processes, like mammals. Genetic analyses using Drosophila have successfully identified a number of conserved regulatory mechanisms underlying sleep between flies and mammals. Identification of sleep-regulating neural circuits is required to further elucidate these molecular mechanisms. Two major brain regions, the mushroom bodies and the central complex, play crucial roles in sleep regulation in Drosophila. Noteworthy, many detailed studies on neural circuits in these brain regions have clearly shown that specific small group of neurons are implicated in sleep homeostasis. Thus, recent progress in Drosophila sleep provides novel insights into understanding the molecular and neural basis of sleep.",2017,"Jun Tomita, Gosuke Ban, Kazuhiko Kume, Jun Tomita, Gosuke Ban, Kazuhiko Kume"
Circadian light-input pathways in Drosophila,27066180,10.1080/19420889.2015.1102805,"Light is the most important environmental cue to entrain the circadian clock in most animals. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the light entrainment mechanisms of the clock have been well-studied. The Drosophila brain contains approximately 150 neurons that rhythmically express circadian clock genes. These neurons are called ""clock neurons"" and control behavioral activity rhythms. Many clock neurons express the Cryptochrome (CRY) protein, which is sensitive to UV and blue light, and thus enables clock neurons deep in the brain to directly perceive light. In addition to the CRY protein, external photoreceptors in the Drosophila eyes play an important role in circadian light-input pathways. Recent studies have provided new insights into the mechanisms that integrate these light inputs into the circadian network of the brain. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge on the light entrainment pathways in the Drosophila circadian clock.",2015,"Taishi Yoshii, Christiane Hermann-Luibl, Charlotte Helfrich-Förster, Taishi Yoshii, Christiane Hermann-Luibl, Charlotte Helfrich-Förster"
Promoter elements in Drosophila melanogaster revealed by sequence analysis,7768444,,"A Drosophila Promoter Database containing 252 independent Drosophila melanogaster promoter entries has been compiled. The database and its subsets have been searched for overrepresented sequences. The analysis reveals that the proximal promoter region displays the most dramatic nucleotide sequence irregularities and exhibits a tripartite structure, consisting of TATA at -25/-30 bp, initiator (Inr) at +/- 5 bp and a novel class of downstream elements at +20/+30 bp from the RNA start site. These latter elements are also strand-specific. However, they differ from TATA and Inr in several aspects: (1) they are represented not by a single, but by multiple sequences, (2) they are shorter, (3) their position is less strictly fixed with respect to the RNA start site, (4) they emerge as a characteristic feature of Drosophila promoters and (5) some of them are strongly overrepresented in the TATA-less, but not TATA-containing, subset. About one-half of known Drosophila promoters can be classified as TATA-less.

The immunoglobulin superfamily in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans and the evolution of complexity,14623821,10.1242/dev.00848,"Drosophila melanogaster is an arthropod with a much more complex anatomy and physiology than the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We investigated one of the protein superfamilies in the two organisms that plays a major role in development and function of cell-cell communication: the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). Using hidden Markov models, we identified 142 IgSF proteins in Drosophila and 80 in C. elegans. Of these, 58 and 22, respectively, have been previously identified by experiments. On the basis of homology and the structural characterisation of the proteins, we can suggest probable types of function for most of the novel proteins. Though overall Drosophila has fewer genes than C. elegans, it has many more IgSF cell-surface and secreted proteins. Half the IgSF proteins in C. elegans and three quarters of those in Drosophila have evolved subsequent to the divergence of the two organisms. These results suggest that the expansion of this protein superfamily is one of the factors that have contributed to the formation of the more complex physiological features that are found in Drosophila.",2003,"Christine Vogel, Sarah A Teichmann, Cyrus Chothia, Christine Vogel, Sarah A Teichmann, Cyrus Chothia"
"Specific reduction of N,N-dimethylnitrosamine mutagenicity in Drosophila melanogaster by dimethyl sulfoxide",3119334,10.1002/em.2850100411,"Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) used as a solvent has been observed to complicate mutagenicity screens by interacting with tested chemicals to yield false positives or negatives. We have used DMSO as a solvent in the Drosophila melanogaster recessive sex-linked lethal mutation assay and find that it reduces, but does not abolish, the detectable mutagenicity of N,N-dimethylnitrosamine (DMN). Its use as a solvent with procarbazine, another promutagen, shows no effect on mutagenicity in Drosophila. DMSO does not exhibit a general inhibitory action on microsome activity when ecdysone 20-monooxygenase activity is used as a measure of cytochrome P-450 activity. We were unable to detect the low DMN demethylase activity in the strain used. Hence, the inhibitory effect of DMSO in Drosophila at both the physiological and biological level appears to be limited and not general in action. Because DMN and DMSO are similar in structure, it is possible that DMSO is interacting with a DMN demethylase in Drosophila. This might lead to a reduction in the conversion of DMN to a mutagen. Consequently, from the results of this study and others DMSO should be used cautiously as a solvent in Drosophila mutagen screening.",1987,"R K Brodberg, M J Mitchell, S L Smith, R C Woodruff, R K Brodberg, M J Mitchell, S L Smith, R C Woodruff"
Herbicide paraquat induces sex-specific variation of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in Drosophila melanogaster,25823231,,"There are several reports on herbicide paraquat (PQ)-induced Parkinsonian-like pathology in different animal models, including Drosophila melanogaster. Also, the role of some inflammatory factors, such as nitric oxide is reported in PQ-induced neuroinflammation of Drosophila. Although invertebrate model is valuable to study the conserved inflammatory pathway at the time of neurodegeneration, but neuroinflammation during PQ-mediated neurodegeneration has not been studied explicitly in Drosophila. In this study, the inflammatory response was examined in Drosophila model during PQ-induced neurodegeneration. We found that after exposure to PQ, survivability and locomotion ability were affected in both sexes of Drosophila. Behavioural symptoms indicated similar physiological features of Parkinson's disease (PD) in different animal models, as well as in humans. Our study revealed alteration in proinflamatory factor, TNF-α and Eiger (the Drosophila homologue in TNF superfamily) was changed in PQ-treated Drosophila both at protein and mRNA level during neurodegeneration. To ensure the occurrence of neurodegeneration, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive neuronal cell loss was considered as a hallmark of PD in the fly brain. Thus, our result revealed the conserved inflammatory events in terms of expression of TNF-α and Eiger present during a sublethal dose of PQ-administered neurodegeneration in male and female Drosophila with significant variation in proinflammatory factor level among both the sexes.",2014,"Shauryabrota Dalui, Arindam Bhattacharyya, Shauryabrota Dalui, Arindam Bhattacharyya"
Comparative gene expression in the heads of Drosophila melanogaster and Tribolium castaneum and the segmental affinity of the Drosophila hypopharyngeal lobes,19196336,10.1111/j.1525-142X.2008.00305.x,"Drosophila melanogaster has long played an important role in debates surrounding insect and arthropod head segmentation. It is surprising, therefore, that one important feature of Drosophila head segmentation has remained controversial: namely the position of the boundary between the intercalary and mandibular segments. The Drosophila embryonic head has a pair of structures lying behind the stomodeum known as the hypopharyngeal lobes. Traditionally they have been seen as part of the intercalary segment. More recent work looking at the position of the lobes relative to various marker genes has been somewhat equivocal: segment polarity gene expression has been used to argue for a mandibular affinity of these lobes, while the expression of the anterior-most hox gene labial (lab) has supported an intercalary affinity. We have addressed the question of the segmental affinity of the hypopharyngeal lobes by conducting a detailed comparison of gene expression patterns between Drosophila and the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, in which the intercalary segment is unambiguously marked out by lab. We demonstrate that there is a large degree of conservation in gene expression patterns between Drosophila and Tribolium, and this argues against an intercalary segment affinity for the hypopharyngeal lobes. The lobes appear to be largely mandibular in origin, although some gene expression attributed to them appears to be associated with the stomodeum. We propose that the difficulties in interpreting the Drosophila head result from a topological shift in the Drosophila embryonic head, associated with the derived process of head involution.",2009,"Andrew D Economou, Maximilian J Telford, Andrew D Economou, Maximilian J Telford"

Transcription elongation rate has a tissue-specific impact on alternative cleavage and polyadenylation in Drosophila melanogaster,28851752,10.1261/rna.062661.117,"Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a mechanism that generates multiple mRNA isoforms with different 3'UTRs and/or coding sequences from a single gene. Here, using 3' region extraction and deep sequencing (3'READS), we have systematically mapped cleavage and polyadenylation sites (PASs) in Drosophila melanogaster, expanding the total repertoire of PASs previously identified for the species, especially those located in A-rich genomic sequences. Cis-element analysis revealed distinct sequence motifs around fly PASs when compared to mammalian ones, including the greater enrichment of upstream UAUA elements and the less prominent presence of downstream UGUG elements. We found that over 75% of mRNA genes in Drosophila melanogaster undergo APA. The head tissue tends to use distal PASs when compared to the body, leading to preferential expression of APA isoforms with long 3'UTRs as well as with distal terminal exons. The distance between the APA sites and intron location of PAS are important parameters for APA difference between body and head, suggesting distinct PAS selection contexts. APA analysis of the RpII215C4 mutant strain, which harbors a mutant RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) with a slower elongation rate, revealed that a 50% decrease in transcriptional elongation rate leads to a mild trend of more usage of proximal, weaker PASs, both in 3'UTRs and in introns, consistent with the ""first come, first served"" model of APA regulation. However, this trend was not observed in the head, suggesting a different regulatory context in neuronal cells. Together, our data expand the PAS collection for Drosophila melanogaster and reveal a tissue-specific effect of APA regulation by RNAPII elongation rate.",2017,"Xiaochuan Liu, Jaime Freitas, Dinghai Zheng, Marta S Oliveira, Mainul Hoque, Torcato Martins, Telmo Henriques, Bin Tian, Alexandra Moreira, Xiaochuan Liu, Jaime Freitas, Dinghai Zheng, Marta S Oliveira, Mainul Hoque, Torcato Martins, Telmo Henriques, Bin Tian, Alexandra Moreira"

Also, the aftermath of the BLAE on the neuronal activities of AChE, butyrylcholine (BChE), monoamine oxidase (MAO), angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE), ATP diphosphohydrolase (ATPdase), and ADPdase, catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), plus TBARS, and nitric oxide (NO) content in rats treated with scopolamine (1 mg/kg. bwt. i.p.) was evaluated. In addition, the alkaloid characterization for constituent BLAE was determined. The outcomes proved that BLAE displayed antioxidant properties and inhibit activities of AChE, BChE, MAO, ACE, ATPdase, and ADPdase in vitro. Furthermore, transgenic flies treated with the BLAE exhibited significant levels of amelioration on survival rate and activities of BACE-1, AChE, GST, and catalase. In scopolamine-treated rats, AChE, BChE, MAO and NTPdases activities, and antioxidant status were upturned in rats pretreated with BLAE.

"A Toll-Spätzle pathway in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta",22516181,10.1016/j.ibmb.2012.03.009,"Insects synthesize a battery of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and expression of AMP genes is regulated by the Toll and Imd (immune deficiency) pathways in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila Toll pathway is activated after Spätzle (Spz) is cleaved by Spätzle processing enzyme (SPE) to release the active C-terminal C106 domain (DmSpz-C106), which then binds to the Toll receptor to initiate the signaling pathway and regulate expression of AMP genes such as drosomycin. Toll and Spz genes have been identified in other insects, but interaction between Toll and Spz and direct evidence for a Toll-Spz pathway in other insect species have not been demonstrated. Our aim is to investigate a Toll-Spz pathway in Manduca sexta, and compare M. sexta and D. melanogaster Toll-Spz pathways. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays showed that MsToll(ecto) (the ecto-domain of M. sexta Toll) could interact with MsSpz-C108 (the active C-terminal C108 domain of M. sexta Spz) but not with full-length MsSpz, and DmToll(ecto) could interact with DmSpz-C106 but not DmSpz, suggesting that Toll receptor only binds to the active C-terminal domain of Spz. Co-expression of MsToll-MsSpz-C108, but not MsToll-MsSpz, could up-regulate expression of drosomycin gene in Drosophila S2 cells, indicating that MsToll-MsSpz-C108 complex can activate the Toll signaling pathway. In vivo assays showed that activation of AMP genes, including cecropin, attacin, moricin and lebocin, in M. sexta larvae by purified recombinant MsSpz-C108 could be blocked by pre-injection of antibody to MsToll, further confirming a Toll-Spz pathway in M. sexta, a lepidopteran insect.",2012,"Xue Zhong, Xiao-Xia Xu, Hui-Yu Yi, Christopher Lin, Xiao-Qiang Yu, Xue Zhong, Xiao-Xia Xu, Hui-Yu Yi, Christopher Lin, Xiao-Qiang Yu"
Widespread evidence for horizontal transfer of transposable elements across Drosophila genomes,19226459,10.1186/gb-2009-10-2-r22,"Background:
      
    

    
      Horizontal transfer (HT) could play an important role in the long-term persistence of transposable elements (TEs) because it provides them with the possibility to avoid the checking effects of host-silencing mechanisms and natural selection, which would eventually drive their elimination from the genome. However, despite the increasing evidence for HT of TEs, its rate of occurrence among the TE pools of model eukaryotic organisms is still unknown.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We have extracted and compared the nucleotide sequences of all potentially functional autonomous TEs present in the genomes of Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans and D. yakuba - 1,436 insertions classified into 141 distinct families - and show that a large fraction of the families found in two or more species display levels of genetic divergence and within-species diversity that are significantly lower than expected by assuming copy-number equilibrium and vertical transmission, and consistent with a recent origin by HT. Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons form nearly 90% of the HT cases detected. HT footprints are also frequent among DNA transposons (40% of families compared) but rare among non-LTR retroelements (6%). Our results suggest a genomic rate of 0.04 HT events per family per million years between the three species studied, as well as significant variation between major classes of elements.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The genome-wide patterns of sequence diversity of the active autonomous TEs in the genomes of D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. yakuba suggest that one-third of the TE families originated by recent HT between these species. This result emphasizes the important role of horizontal transmission in the natural history of Drosophila TEs.",2009,"Carolina Bartolomé, Xabier Bello, Xulio Maside, Carolina Bartolomé, Xabier Bello, Xulio Maside"
"Functional conservation of the sex-lethal sex determining promoter, Sxl-Pe, in Drosophila virilis",12739140,10.1007/s00427-003-0304-1,"The primary sex determination signal in Drosophila melanogaster, the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, sets the activity state of the switch gene, Sex-lethal ( Sxl), by regulating the establishment promoter, m-Sxl-Pe. We have identified and characterized the establishment promoter, v-Sxl-Pe, of the distantly related species Drosophila virilis. Like melanogaster, the virilis Sxl-Pe is organized into four sub-domains: the Sxl-Pe mRNA leader and exon E1 of Sxl protein, the core promoter, the sex-specific element and the augmentation element. The core promoter and sex-specific element of v-Sxl-Pe show considerable sequence similarity to m-Sxl-Pe and contain target sites for components of the X/A signaling system. While the augmentation element of v-Sxl-Pe also has sequence motifs that could function as target sites for the X/A signaling system, it shows little similarity to the melanogaster augmentation element. Functional studies reveal that v-Sxl-Pe drives sex-specific expression in D. melanogaster embryos and that the activity of the virilis promoter is controlled by known components of the melanogaster X/A counting system. Although v-Sxl-Pe responds appropriately to the melanogaster sex determination signal, it is less active than Sxl-Pe from melanogaster. Unexpectedly, the reduced activity is due to differences in the activity of the conserved core promoter, while the non-conserved augmentation element functions effectively. These findings suggest that low-affinity target sites for the X/A counting system are critical for the functioning of Sxl-Pe.",2003,"Timothy Morgan Jinks, Gretchen Calhoun, Paul Schedl, Timothy Morgan Jinks, Gretchen Calhoun, Paul Schedl"

Ameliorative effects of flavonoids and polyketides on the rotenone induced Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease,32937168,10.1016/j.neuro.2020.09.004,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder associated with the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons (DA). PD treatment remains unsatisfactory as the current synthetic drugs in clinical use relies on managing only motor symptoms. This study investigated antioxidant potentials of selected compounds namely, 5,6,7,4´-tetramethoxyflavone (1), 6-hydroxy-2,3,4,4´-tetramethoxychalcone (2), 6-methoxyhamiltone A (3), diosquinone (4) and toussantine D (5) against rotenone (6) induced PD in Drosophila melanogaster. Toxicity of these compounds was conducted by monitoring flies' survival for seven days and determining the lethal concentrations (LC50). Whereas compound 1 had LC50 value of 91.3 µM within three days, compounds 2, 3, 4, and 5 had LC50 values of 87.2, 58.0, 64.0 and > 1000 µM, respectively on the seventh day of the experiment. We exposed flies (1-4 days old) to 500 µM rotenone and co-treated with different doses of the test compounds in the diet for seven days at final concentrations of 11.0, 43.6 and 87.2 µM for compounds 2 and 3. The concentrations used for compound 4 were 8.0, 32.0 and 64.0 µM, while 250, 500 and 1000 µM were used for compound 5. Rotenone fed flies showed impaired climbing ability compared to control flies, the phenotype that was rescued by the treatment of tested phytochemicals. Rotenone toxicity also increased malondialdehyde levels assayed by lipid peroxidation in the brain tissues relative to control flies. This effect was reduced in flies exposed to rotenone and co-treated with the phytochemicals. Moreover, expression levels of mRNA of antioxidant enzymes; superoxide dismutase and catalase were elevated in flies treated with rotenone and normalized in flies that were co-treated with tested compounds. Besides compound 1, this study provides overall evidence that the tested flavonoids and polyketides ameliorated the rotenone provoked neurotoxicity in D. melanogaster by battling the induced oxidative stress in brain cells including DA neurons and hence rescue the locomotor behaviour deficits.",2020,"Angela A Siima, Flora Stephano, Joan J E Munissi, Stephen S Nyandoro, Angela A Siima, Flora Stephano, Joan J E Munissi, Stephen S Nyandoro"
Functional genetic characterization of salivary gland development in Aedes aegypti,23497573,10.1186/2041-9139-4-9,"Background:
      
    

    
      Despite the devastating global impact of mosquito-borne illnesses on human health, very little is known about mosquito developmental biology. In this investigation, functional genetic analysis of embryonic salivary gland development was performed in Aedes aegypti, the dengue and yellow fever vector and an emerging model for vector mosquito development. Although embryonic salivary gland development has been well studied in Drosophila melanogaster, little is known about this process in mosquitoes or other arthropods.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Mosquitoes possess orthologs of many genes that regulate Drosophila melanogaster embryonic salivary gland development. The expression patterns of a large subset of these genes were assessed during Ae. aegypti development. These studies identified a set of molecular genetic markers for the developing mosquito salivary gland. Analysis of marker expression allowed for tracking of the progression of Ae. aegypti salivary gland development in embryos. In Drosophila, the salivary glands develop from placodes located in the ventral neuroectoderm. However, in Ae. aegypti, salivary marker genes are not expressed in placode-like patterns in the ventral neuroectoderm. Instead, marker gene expression is detected in salivary gland rudiments adjacent to the proventriculus. These observations highlighted the need for functional genetic characterization of mosquito salivary gland development. An siRNA- mediated knockdown strategy was therefore employed to investigate the role of one of the marker genes, cyclic-AMP response element binding protein A (Aae crebA), during Ae. aegypti salivary gland development. These experiments revealed that Aae crebA encodes a key transcriptional regulator of the secretory pathway in the developing Ae. aegypti salivary gland.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The results of this investigation indicated that the initiation of salivary gland development in Ae. aegypti significantly differs from that of D. melanogaster. Despite these differences, some elements of salivary gland development, including the ability of CrebA to regulate secretory gene expression, are conserved between the two species. These studies underscore the need for further analysis of mosquito developmental genetics and may foster comparative studies of salivary gland development in additional insect species.",2013,"Chilinh Nguyen, Emily Andrews, Christy Le, Longhua Sun, Zeinab Annan, Anthony Clemons, David W Severson, Molly Duman-Scheel, Chilinh Nguyen, Emily Andrews, Christy Le, Longhua Sun, Zeinab Annan, Anthony Clemons, David W Severson, Molly Duman-Scheel"

Genetic dissection of sexual behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,9017901,10.1146/annurev.ento.42.1.551,"Mating of Drosophila melanogaster is a sterotypically patterned behavior consisting of a fixed sequence of actions that are primarily under genetic control. Mutations that disrupt specific aspects of mating activities offer a starting point for exploring the molecular machineries underlying sexual behavior. Several genes, identified as causing aberrant sexual behavior when mutated, have been isolated and cloned, providing molecular probes for expression and mosaic analyses that can be used in specifying the cells responsible for the behavior. This review presents current understandings of mating behavior obtained by such molecular and cellular approaches and provides an overview of future directions of research in behavioral genetics.",1997,"D Yamamoto, J M Jallon, A Komatsu, D Yamamoto, J M Jallon, A Komatsu"

Knockdown of adipokinetic hormone synthesis increases susceptibility to oxidative stress in Drosophila--a role for dFoxO?,25814322,10.1016/j.cbpc.2015.03.006,"Insect adipokinetic hormones (AKHs) are pleiotropic hormones known to play a protective role in response to oxidative stress (OS). However, the precise signaling pathways are unclear. We present evidence that AKH may primarily employ the Forkhead box class O transcription factor (FoxO) to exert this effect. The impact of knocking down AKH synthesis or its over-expression in its response to OS was studied in Drosophila melanogaster. AKH knockdown (AKH-RNAi) as well as AKH overexpression (AKH-oex) was achieved using the Gal-4/UAS system and controls were w(1118) (+/+), AKH-Gal4/+, UAS-AKH/+ and UAS-AKH-RNAi/+. Exposure to 80 μM hydrogen peroxide (HP) revealed that AKH-RNAi flies showed significantly higher mortality than AKH-oex or the respective control lines. This susceptibility was evidenced by significantly enhanced levels of protein carbonyls - a biomarker of OS, in AKH-RNAi flies compared to controls and AKH-oex flies. Interestingly, AKH-oex flies had the least amount of protein carbonyls. AKH-RNAi flies had significantly less dFoxO transcript and translated protein compared to control and AKH-oex flies in un-challenged condition as well as when challenged with HP. Sestrin - a major antioxidant defense protein and one of the targets of dFoxO - was also significantly down-regulated (both at mRNA and protein level) in AKH-RNAi flies (both unchallenged and challenged with HP) compared to control flies and flies with over-expressed AKH. These findings imply that dFoxO may act downstream of AKH as a transcription factor to mediate response to OS in D. melanogaster.",2015,"Andrea Bednářová, Dalibor Kodrík, Natraj Krishnan, Andrea Bednářová, Dalibor Kodrík, Natraj Krishnan"
Genetic strategies for dissecting mammalian and Drosophila voltage-dependent anion channel functions,18622693,10.1007/s10863-008-9146-x,"Voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs), also known as mitochondrial porins, are a family of small pore-forming proteins of the mitochondrial outer membrane that are found in all eukaryotes. VDACs are thought to play important roles in the regulated flux of metabolites between the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments, in overall energy metabolism via interactions with cytosolic kinases, and a debated role in programmed cell death (apoptosis). The mammalian genome contains three VDAC loci termed Vdac1, Vdac2, and Vdac3, raising the question as to what function each isoform may be performing. Based upon expression studies of the mouse VDACs in yeast, biophysical differences can be identified but the physiologic significance of these differences remains unclear. Creation of ""knockout"" cell lines and mice that lack one or more VDAC isoforms has led to the characterization of distinct phenotypes that provide a different set of insights into function which must be interpreted in the context of complex physiologic systems. Functions in male reproduction, the central nervous system and glucose homeostasis have been identified and require a deeper and more mechanistic examination. Annotation of the genome sequence of Drosophila melanogaster has recently revealed three additional genes (CG17137, CG17139, CG17140) with homology to porin, the previously described gene that encodes the VDAC of D. melanogaster. Molecular analysis of these novel VDACs has revealed a complex pattern of gene organization and expression. Sequence comparisons with other insect VDAC homologs suggest that this gene family evolved through a mechanism of duplication and divergence from an ancestral VDAC gene during the radiation of the genus Drosophila. Striking similarities to mouse VDAC mutants can be found that emphasize the conservation of function over a long evolutionary time frame.",2008,"William J Craigen, Brett H Graham, William J Craigen, Brett H Graham"

Understanding Forkhead box class O function: lessons from Drosophila melanogaster,20618068,10.1089/ars.2010.3407,"Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most widely used model organisms. About 77% of known human disease genes have an ortholog in Drosophila, and many of the cellular signaling pathways are common between fruit flies and mammals. For example, a key signaling pathway in the regulation of growth and metabolism, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling pathway, is well conserved between flies and humans. Downstream effectors of this pathway are the Forkhead box class O (FOXO) family of transcription factors, with four members in mammals and a single FOXO protein in Drosophila, dFOXO. Research in Drosophila has been critical to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which FOXO transcription factors regulate insulin signaling. In this review, we summarize the studies leading to dFOXO identification and its characterization as a central regulator of metabolism, life span, cell cycle, growth, and stress resistance.",2011,"Oscar Puig, Jaakko Mattila, Oscar Puig, Jaakko Mattila"
Diabetic flies? Using Drosophila melanogaster to understand the causes of monogenic and genetically complex diseases,12431248,10.1034/j.1399-0004.2002.620502.x,"Approximately three-quarters of human disease loci have counterparts in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. This model organism is therefore extremely valuable for using to understand the role of these loci in normal development, and for unravelling genetic pathways in which these loci take part. Important advantages for Drosophila in such studies are its completed genome, the unparalleled collection of mutations already in existence, the relative ease in which new mutations can be generated, the existence of convenient techniques for inactivating or overexpressing genes in dispensable tissues that are easily observed and measured, and the ability to readily carry out second-site modifier genetics. Recent work in Drosophila on the insulin-signaling pathway, a pathway of profound clinical importance, is reviewed as an illustration of how such research can provide fundamental insights into the functions of this pathway in regulating growth and development. Moreover, Drosophila research is now identifying heretofore unknown regulators of insulin signaling, as well as indicating novel functions for this pathway in suppressing benign tumor formation and regulating life span.",2002,"P Lasko, P Lasko"

Substrate-borne vibratory communication during courtship in Drosophila melanogaster,23103187,10.1016/j.cub.2012.09.042,"Courtship in Drosophila melanogaster has become an iconic example of an innate and interactive series of behaviors. The female signals her acceptance of copulation by becoming immobile in response to a male's display of stereotyped actions. The male and female communicate via vision, air-borne sounds, and pheromones, but what triggers the female's immobility is undetermined. Here, we describe an overlooked and important component of Drosophila courtship. Video recordings and laser vibrometry show that the male abdomen shakes (""quivers""), generating substrate-borne vibrations at about six pulses per second. We present evidence that the female becomes receptive and stops walking because she senses these vibrations, rather than as a response to air-borne songs produced by the male fluttering the wings. We also present evidence that the neural circuits expressing the sex-determination genes fruitless and doublesex drive quivering behavior. These abdominal quivers and associated vibrations, as well as their effect on female receptivity, are conserved in other Drosophila species. Substrate-borne vibrations are an ancient form of communication that is widespread in animals. Our findings in Drosophila open a door to study the neuromuscular circuitry responsible for these signals and the sensory systems needed for their reception.",2012,"Caroline C G Fabre, Berthold Hedwig, Graham Conduit, Peter A Lawrence, Stephen F Goodwin, José Casal, Caroline C G Fabre, Berthold Hedwig, Graham Conduit, Peter A Lawrence, Stephen F Goodwin, José Casal"

The enzyme replicates predominantly single-stranded and double-stranded DNAs: the rate of DNA synthesis is greatest on the gapped homopolymeric template poly(dA).oligo(dT), while the highest substrate specificity is observed on single-stranded DNA templates of natural DNA sequence. Kinetic experiments and direct physical analysis of DNA synthetic products indicate that the Drosophila DNA polymerase gamma polymerizes nucleotides by a quasi-processive mechanism. The mitochondrial enzyme demonstrates a high degree of accuracy in nucleotide incorporation which is nearly identical with that of the replicative DNA polymerase alpha from Drosophila embryos. Thus, the catalytic properties of the near-homogeneous Drosophila DNA polymerase gamma are consistent with the in vivo requirements for mitochondrial DNA synthesis as described in a variety of animal systems.",1988,"C M Wernette, M C Conway, L S Kaguni, C M Wernette, M C Conway, L S Kaguni"

The multifunctional Drosophila melanogaster V-ATPase is encoded by a multigene family,10340851,10.1023/a:1005400731289,"In animals, V-ATPases are believed to play roles in the plasma membrane, as well as endomembrane. To understand these different functions, it is necessary to adopt a genetic approach in a physiologically tractable model organism. For this purpose, Drosophila melanogaster is ideal, because of the powerful genetics associated with the organism and because of the unusually informative epithelial phenotype provided by the Malpighian tubule. Recently, the first animal ""knockouts"" of a V-ATPase were described in Drosophila. The resulting phenotypes have general utility for our understanding of V-ATPase function and suggest a screen for novel subunits and associated proteins.

We have used this system to determine whether human matrix attachment regions (MARs) can function as insulator elements in vivo. Two different human MARs, from the apolipoprotein B and alpha1-antitrypsin loci, insulated white transgene expression from position effects in Drosophila melanogaster. Both elements reduced variability in transgene expression without enhancing levels of white gene expression. In contrast, expression of white transgenes containing human DNA segments without matrix-binding activity was highly variable in Drosophila transformants.

Conditional mutations in Drosophila melanogaster: On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of G. Mendel's report in Brünn,26281767,10.1016/j.mrrev.2015.06.001,"The basis for modern genetics was laid by Gregor Mendel. He proposed that traits belonging to the intraspecific variability class be studied. However, individuals of one species possess traits of another class. They are related to intraspecific similarity. Individuals never differ from each other in these traits. By analogy with traits varying within a species and determined by genes, it is conjectured that intraspecific similarity is determined by genes, too. If so, mutations in these genes can be obtained. This paper provides a review of works published in 2000-2014 that: (1) propose breeding methods for detection of mutations in Drosophila melanogaster genes that lead intraspecific similarity; these mutations were called conditional; (2) describe collections of conditional mutations in chromosomes X, 2, and 3 of Drosophila; (3) show unusual features of epigenetic nature in the mutants; and (4) analyze these features of the mutants. Based on the peculiarities of manifestation it is supposed that the recognized conditional mutations occur in genes responsible for intraspecific similarity. The genes presumably belong to the so-called regulatory network of the Drosophila genome. This approach expands the scope of breeding analysis introduced by G. Mendel for heredity studies 150 years ago.",2015,"Boris F Chadov, Nina B Fedorova, Eugenia V Chadova, Boris F Chadov, Nina B Fedorova, Eugenia V Chadova"

Second chromosome genes required for heart development in Drosophila melanogaster,17941041,10.1002/dvg.20333,"Heart development is an evolutionarily conserved process. The cardiac organ of Drosophila melanogaster is the dorsal vessel, a linear contractile tissue with cellular and morphogenetic similarities to the primitive heart tube formed at an early stage of vertebrate heart formation. Abundant evidence shows comparable intercellular signaling pathways and transcription factor networks are utilized in Drosophila and vertebrates, to specify cardiac progenitor cells and instruct their differentiation and function in forming the mature heart. With this proven conservation in mind, we screened the second chromosome of Drosophila for genetic intervals that harbor additional loci required for normal dorsal vessel morphogenesis. Our studies identified numerous regions, that when deleted, culminated in dorsal vessels with abnormal cell numbers and/or structural properties. Certain of the deficiency intervals were further characterized to identify individual genes essential for proper cardiac organ formation. Our analyses identified eight genes of diverse functions that are needed for dorsal vessel development. Several of these sequences have known vertebrate homologues, further supporting a conserved genetic basis for heart formation in Drosophila and higher eukaryotes.",2007,"Ye Tao, Audrey E Christiansen, Robert A Schulz, Ye Tao, Audrey E Christiansen, Robert A Schulz"
A unique ribonucleoprotein complex assembles preferentially on ecdysone-responsive sites in Drosophila melanogaster,8355684,10.1128/mcb.13.9.5323,"The protein on ecdysone puffs (PEP) is associated preferentially with active ecdysone-inducible puffs on Drosophila polytene chromosomes and contains sequence motifs characteristic of transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins (S.

PEP is associated with RNA in vivo, as demonstrated here by the sensitivity of PEP-specific chromosomal immunostaining in situ to RNase digestion and by the immunopurification of PEP in Drosophila cell extract with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complexes. As revealed by sequential immunostaining, PEP is found on a subset of chromosomal sites bound by the HRB (heterogeneous nuclear RNA-binding) proteins, which are basic Drosophila hnRNPs.

Negative genetic correlation between longevity and its hormetic extension by dietary restriction in Drosophila melanogaster,31786681,10.1007/s10522-019-09852-z,"Longevity is a highly malleable trait which is influenced by many genetic and environmental factors including nutrition. Mild stress of dietary restriction (DR) is often beneficial by extending longevity in many organisms. Here, DR-induced effects on longevity were tested for genetic variation in a set of recombinant inbred lines (RIL) in D. melanogaster. Genetic variability was significant in the longevity response following a DR-treatment across RIL, with detrimental effects in several RIL but beneficial effects in other RIL. One quantitative trait locus (QTL) was consistently significant in the middle of chromosome 2 for DR-induced changes in longevity, including hormesis (an increase in longevity by DR). Another QTL co-localized with a previously found QTL for starvation resistance in females. Several other QTL were also significant on most chromosomal arms. Longevity in controls was negatively correlated to DR effects across RIL for longevity in females, the sex showing higher DR-induced hormesis.

A genome-wide analysis of the D. melanogaster genome found that differences in TE density across 50 kb genomic regions was due both to transposition and duplication. At smaller genomic scales, promoter regions of hsp genes and the promoter region of CG18446 have been shown to accumulate TE insertions. In this work, we have further analyzed the promoter region of CG18446. We screened 218 strains collected in 15 natural populations, and we found that the CG18446 promoter region contains 20 independent roo insertions. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we suggest that the presence of multiple roo insertions in this region is likely to be the result of several bursts of transposition. Moreover, we found that the roo insertional cluster in the CG18446 promoter region is unique: no other promoter region in the genome contains a similar number of roo insertions. We found that, similar to hsp gene promoters, chromatin accessibility could be one of the factors explaining the recurrent insertions of roo elements in CG18446 promoter region.",2019,"Miriam Merenciano, Camillo Iacometti, Josefa González, Miriam Merenciano, Camillo Iacometti, Josefa González"
Toxic wavelength of blue light changes as insects grow,29920536,10.1371/journal.pone.0199266,"Short-wavelength visible light (blue light: 400-500 nm) has lethal effects on various insects, such as fruit flies, mosquitoes, and flour beetles. However, the most toxic wavelengths of blue light might differ across developmental stages. Here, we investigate how the toxicity of blue light changes with the developmental stages of an insect by irradiating Drosophila melanogaster with different wavelengths of blue light. Specifically, the lethal effect on eggs increased at shorter light wavelengths (i.e., toward 405 nm). In contrast, wavelengths from 405 to 466 nm had similar lethal effects on larvae. A wavelength of 466 nm had the strongest lethal effect on pupae; however, mortality declined as pupae grew. A wavelength of 417 nm was the most harmful to adults at low photon flux density, while 466 nm was the most harmful to adults at high photon flux density. These findings suggest that, as the morphology of D. melanogaster changes with growth, the most harmful wavelength also changes. In addition, our results indicated that reactive oxygen species influence the lethal effect of blue light. Our findings show that blue light irradiation could be used as an effective pest control method by adjusting the wavelength to target specific developmental stages.",2018,"Kazuki Shibuya, Shun Onodera, Masatoshi Hori, Kazuki Shibuya, Shun Onodera, Masatoshi Hori"
Adenosine signaling and the energetic costs of induced immunity,25915419,10.1371/journal.pbio.1002136,"Life history theory predicts that trait evolution should be constrained by competing physiological demands on an organism. Immune defense provides a classic example in which immune responses are presumed to be costly and therefore come at the expense of other traits related to fitness. One strategy for mitigating the costs of expensive traits is to render them inducible, such that the cost is paid only when the trait is utilized. In the current issue of PLOS Biology, Bajgar and colleagues elegantly demonstrate the energetic and life history cost of the immune response that Drosophila melanogaster larvae induce after infection by the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi. These authors show that infection-induced proliferation of defensive blood cells commands a diversion of dietary carbon away from somatic growth and development, with simple sugars instead being shunted to the hematopoetic organ for rapid conversion into the raw energy required for cell proliferation. This metabolic shift results in a 15% delay in the development of the infected larva and is mediated by adenosine signaling between the hematopoietic organ and the central metabolic control organ of the host fly. The adenosine signal thus allows D. melanogaster to rapidly marshal the energy needed for effective defense and to pay the cost of immunity only when infected.",2015,"Brian P Lazzaro, Brian P Lazzaro"
A staging scheme for the development of the scuttle fly Megaselia abdita,24409295,10.1371/journal.pone.0084421,"Model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, provide powerful experimental tools for the study of development. However, approaches using model systems need to be complemented by comparative studies for us to gain a deeper understanding of the functional properties and evolution of developmental processes. New model organisms need to be established to enable such comparative work. The establishment of new model system requires a detailed description of its life cycle and development. The resulting staging scheme is essential for providing morphological context for molecular studies, and allows us to homologise developmental processes between species. In this paper, we provide a staging scheme and morphological characterisation of the life cycle for an emerging non-drosophilid dipteran model system: the scuttle fly Megaselia abdita. We pay particular attention to early embryogenesis (cleavage and blastoderm stages up to gastrulation), the formation and retraction of extraembryonic tissues, and the determination and formation of germ (pole) cells. Despite the large evolutionary distance between the two species (approximately 150 million years), we find that M. abdita development is remarkably similar to D. melanogaster in terms of developmental landmarks and their relative timing.",2014,"Karl R Wotton, Eva Jiménez-Guri, Belén García Matheu, Johannes Jaeger, Karl R Wotton, Eva Jiménez-Guri, Belén García Matheu, Johannes Jaeger"
Drosophila melanogaster Selection for Survival after Infection with Bacillus cereus Spores: Evolutionary Genetic and Phenotypic Investigations of Respiration and Movement,23634317,10.1155/2013/576452,"Laboratory populations of D. melanogaster have been subjected to selection for survival after live spores of B. cereus were introduced as a pathogenic agent. The present study was designed to investigate correlated traits: respiration as a metabolic trait and movement as a behavioral trait. An underlying hypothesis was that the evolution of increased survival after B. cereus infection exerts a metabolic cost associated with elevated immunity and this would be detected by increased respiration rates. There was support for this hypothesis in the male response to selection, but not for selected-line females. Two phenotypic effects were also observed in the study. Females especially showed a marked increase in respiration after mating compared to the other assay stages regardless of whether respiration was measured per fly or adjusted by lean mass or dry weight. Given that mating stimulates egg production, it is feasible that elevated metabolism was needed to provision oocytes with yolk. Females also moved less than males, perhaps due to behaviors related to oviposition whereas elevated male activity might be due to behaviors associated with seeking females and courtship. Relatively low movement of females indicated that their elevated respiration after mating was not due to a change in locomotion.",2013,"Junjie Ma, Andrew K Benson, Stephen D Kachman, Deidra J Jacobsen, Lawrence G Harshman, Junjie Ma, Andrew K Benson, Stephen D Kachman, Deidra J Jacobsen, Lawrence G Harshman"
The Caenorhabditis elegans GW182 protein AIN-1 interacts with PAB-1 and subunits of the PAN2-PAN3 and CCR4-NOT deadenylase complexes,22402495,10.1093/nar/gks218,"GW182 family proteins are essential for miRNA-mediated gene silencing in animal cells. They are recruited to miRNA targets via interactions with Argonaute proteins and then promote translational repression and degradation of the miRNA targets. The human and Drosophila melanogaster GW182 proteins share a similar domain organization and interact with PABPC1 as well as with subunits of the PAN2-PAN3 and CCR4-NOT deadenylase complexes. The homologous proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans, AIN-1 and AIN-2, lack most of the domains present in the vertebrate and insect proteins, raising the question as to how AIN-1 and AIN-2 contribute to silencing. Here, we show that both AIN-1 and AIN-2 interact with Argonaute proteins through GW repeats in the middle region of the AIN proteins. However, only AIN-1 interacts with C. elegans and D. melanogaster PABPC1, PAN3, NOT1 and NOT2, suggesting that AIN-1 and AIN-2 are functionally distinct.

"Automatic annotation of experimentally derived, evolutionarily conserved post-translational modifications onto multiple genomes",21571812,10.1093/database/bar019,"New generation sequencing technologies have resulted in significant increases in the number of complete genomes. Functional characterization of these genomes, such as by high-throughput proteomics, is an important but challenging task due to the difficulty of scaling up existing experimental techniques. By use of comparative genomics techniques, experimental results can be transferred from one genome to another, while at the same time minimizing errors by requiring discovery in multiple genomes. In this study, protein phosphorylation, an essential component of many cellular processes, is studied using data from large-scale proteomics analyses of the phosphoproteome. Phosphorylation sites from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Drosophila melanogaster phosphopeptide data sets were mapped onto conserved domains in NCBI's manually curated portion of Conserved Domain Database (CDD). In this subset, 25 phosphorylation sites are found to be evolutionarily conserved between the three species studied. Transfer of phosphorylation annotation of these conserved sites onto sequences sharing the same conserved domains yield 3253 phosphosite annotations for proteins from coelomata, the taxonomic division that spans H. sapiens, M. musculus and D. melanogaster.

The ultrashort (<100 base) sequences generated by this technology pose specific biological and computational challenges for de novo assembly of large genomes. To account for this, we devised a method for experimentally partitioning the genome using reduced representation (RR) libraries prior to assembly. We use two restriction enzymes independently to create a series of overlapping fragment libraries, each containing a tractable subset of the genome. Together, these libraries allow us to reassemble the entire genome without the need of a reference sequence. As proof of concept, we applied this approach to sequence and assembled the majority of the 125-Mb Drosophila melanogaster genome.

As expected, they are present in human Alu sequences. Our programs may also give a graph and a list of their position in the genome. Detection of clusters is also possible. In most cases, these sequences contain few alternating regions. Their intrinsic structure and their influence on nucleosome formation are not known. In particular, we have found new features of short sequences in C. elegans, which are distributed in heterogeneous clusters. They appear as punctuation marks in the chromosomes.

"Bursicon, the tanning hormone of insects: recent advances following the discovery of its molecular identity",19005656,10.1007/s00359-008-0386-3,"Bursicon was identified in 1965 as a peptide neurohormone that initiates the tanning of the insect cuticle immediately after the shedding of the old one during the final stages of the molting process. Its molecular identity as an approximately 30 kDa bioactive heterodimer consisting of two cystine knot proteins resisted elucidation for 43 years. The sequence of the two bursicon subunits is highly conserved among arthropods, and this conservation extends even to echinoderms. We review the efforts leading to bursicon's characterization, the identification of its leucine-rich repeat-containing, G protein-coupled receptor (LGR2), and the progress towards revealing its various functions. It is now clear that bursicon regulates different aspects of wing inflation in Drosophila melanogaster besides being involved at various points in the cuticle tanning process in different insects. We also describe the current knowledge of the expression of bursicon in the central nervous system of different insects in large homologous neurosecretory cells, and the changes in its expression during the development of Manduca sexta and D. melanogaster.

Specific and conserved sequences in D. melanogaster and C. elegans lamins and histone H2A mediate the attachment of lamins to chromosomes,17148572,10.1242/jcs.03325,"The intimate association between nuclear lamins and chromatin is thought to regulate higher order chromatin organization. Previous studies have mapped a region between the rod domain and the Ig fold in the tail domain of Drosophila melanogaster lamin Dm0, which binds chromatin in vitro via the histone H2A/H2B dimer. This region contains an evolutionarily conserved nuclear localization signal (NLS) KRKR, and a sequence composed of the amino acids TRAT. Here we show that binding of lamin Dm0 to chromatin requires both NLS and TRAT sequences. Substituting either of the threonine residues in the TRAT sequence with negatively charged residues decreases the binding of lamin Dm0 to chromatin, indicating that this binding could be regulated by phosphorylation. Both lamin Dm0 and C. elegans Ce-lamin bind directly to histone H2A in vitro and this binding requires the NLS. The amino and carboxyl tail domains of histone H2A are each essential, but not sufficient, for binding to lamin Dm0; only a polypeptide containing both histone H2A tail domains binds efficiently to lamin Dm0. Taken together, these results suggest that specific residues in lamin Dm0 and histone H2A mediate the attachment of the nuclear lamina to chromosomes in vivo, which could have implications on the understanding of laminopathic diseases.",2007,"Anna Mattout, Michal Goldberg, Yonatan Tzur, Ayelet Margalit, Yosef Gruenbaum, Anna Mattout, Michal Goldberg, Yonatan Tzur, Ayelet Margalit, Yosef Gruenbaum"
Neuropeptides in interneurons of the insect brain,16761145,10.1007/s00441-006-0210-8,"A large number of neuropeptides has been identified in the brain of insects. At least 35 neuropeptide precursor genes have been characterized in Drosophila melanogaster, some of which encode multiple peptides. Additional neuropeptides have been found in other insect species. With a few notable exceptions, most of the neuropeptides have been demonstrated in brain interneurons of various types. The products of each neuropeptide precursor seem to be co-expressed, and each precursor displays a unique neuronal distribution pattern. Commonly, each type of neuropeptide is localized to a relatively small number of neurons. We describe the distribution of neuropeptides in brain interneurons of a few well-studied insect species. Emphasis has been placed upon interneurons innervating specific brain areas, such as the optic lobes, accessory medulla, antennal lobes, central body, and mushroom bodies. The functional roles of some neuropeptides and their receptors have been investigated in D. melanogaster by molecular genetics techniques. In addition, behavioral and electrophysiological assays have addressed neuropeptide functions in the cockroach Leucophaea maderae. Thus, the involvement of brain neuropeptides in circadian clock function, olfactory processing, various aspects of feeding behavior, and learning and memory are highlighted in this review.

Competition between R1 and R2 transposable elements in the 28S rRNA genes of insects,16093682,10.1159/000084962,"R1 and R2 are non-LTR retrotransposons that insert in the 28S rRNA genes of arthropods. R1 elements insert into a site that is 74 bp downstream of the R2 insertion site, thus the presence of an R2 in the same 28S gene may inhibit the expression of R1. Consistent with such a suggestion, the R1 elements of Drosophila melanogaster have a strong bias against inserting into 28S genes already containing an R2 element. R2 elements, on the other hand, are only 2-3 fold inhibited from inserting into a 28S gene already containing an R1. D. melanogaster R1 elements are unusual in that they generate a 23-bp deletion of the target site upstream of the insertion. Using in vitro assays developed to study R2 integration, we show that the presence of R1 sequences 51 bp downstream of the R2 insertion site changes the nucleosomal structure that can be formed by the R2 target site. The R2 endonuclease is inhibited from cleaving these altered nucleosomes. We suggest that R1 elements have been selected to make this large deletion of the 28S gene to block the insertion of an upstream R2 element. These findings are consistent with the model that R1 and R2 are in competition for the limited number of insertion sites available within their host's genome.",2005,"J Ye, C E Pérez-González, D G Eickbush, T H Eickbush, J Ye, C E Pérez-González, D G Eickbush, T H Eickbush"
Evidence that Egfr contributes to cryptic genetic variation for photoreceptor determination in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster,14588245,10.1016/j.cub.2003.10.001,"One objective of quantitative genetics is to identify the nucleotide variants within genes that contribute to phenotypic variation and susceptibility [1]. In an evolutionary context, this means characterizing the molecular polymorphisms that modify the penetrance and expressivity of perturbed traits. A survey of association between 267 SNPs in almost 11 kb of the D. melanogaster Egfr and the degree of eye roughening due to a gain-of-function Egfr(E1) allele crossed into 210 isogenic wild-type lines provides evidence that a handful of synonymous substitutions supply cryptic variation for photoreceptor determination. Ten sites exceed Bonferroni threshold for association in two sets of crosses to different Egfr(E1) backgrounds including a particularly significant cluster of sites in tight linkage disequilibrium toward the 3' end of the coding region. Epistatic interaction of this cluster with one other site enhances the expressivity of this haplotype. Replication of the strongest associations with an independent sample of 302 phenotypically extreme individuals derived from 1000 crosses of Egfr(E1) to freshly trapped males was achieved using modified case-control and transmission-disequilibrium tests. A tendency for the rarer alleles to have more disrupted eye development suggests that mutation-selection balance is a possible mechanism contributing to maintaining cryptic variation for Egfr.",2003,"Ian Dworkin, Arnar Palsson, Kelli Birdsall, Greg Gibson, Ian Dworkin, Arnar Palsson, Kelli Birdsall, Greg Gibson"
Active suppression of D. melanogaster immune response by long gland products of the parasitic wasp Leptopilina boulardi,12770630,10.1016/s0022-1910(03)00054-4,"To develop inside their insect hosts, endoparasitoid wasps must either evade or overcome the host's immune system. Several ichneumonid and braconid wasps inject polydnaviruses that display well-studied immune suppressive effects. However, little is known about the strategies of immunoevasion used by other parasitoid families, such as figitid wasps. The present study provides experimental evidence, based on superparasitism and injection experiments, that the figitid species Leptopilina boulardi uses an active mechanism to suppress the Drosophila melanogaster host immune response, i.e. the encapsulation of the parasitoid eggs. The immune suppressive factors are localised in the long gland and reservoir of the female genital tractus, where virus-like particles (VLPs) have been observed. Parasitism experiments using a host tumorous strain indicate that these factors do not destroy host lamellocytes but that they impair the melanisation pathway. Interestingly, they are not susceptible to heating and are not depleted with prolonged oviposition experience, in contrast to observations reported for L. heterotoma, another figitid species. The mechanisms that prevent encapsulation of eggs from L. boulardi and L. heterotoma differ in several respects, suggesting that different physiological strategies of immunosuppression might be used by specialised and generalist parasitoids.",2003,"C Labrosse, Y Carton, A Dubuffet, J M Drezen, M Poirie, C Labrosse, Y Carton, A Dubuffet, J M Drezen, M Poirie"

For these reasons, the analysis was continued and extended towards the north (Rhône Valley) and the south (Spain). In the P-M system, all the Languedoc populations evolved from 1983 to 1991 towards the Q type which is characteristic of the Rhône Valley populations. In contrast, M' strains are currently observed in the southernmost French populations and in all Spanish ones, so that there is a clear pattern in their geographical distribution. The frequency of flies infected by the sigma virus dramatically increased from 1983 to 1988 in Languedoc; this increase was clearly correlated with some viral characteristics. But, in northern France, similar characteristics did not trigger any increase in the frequency of infected flies.

The RNA sequence bearing am psi was determined by dideoxy-sequencing with reverse transcriptase. The rDNA coding for this part of the 18S rRNA was sequenced by the Maxam-Gilbert method. Together these two sequencing methods can be used to position the cDNA stop (am psi) in the rRNA sequence. Chemical evidence for the existence of am psi in this RNA sequence was obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of 18S rRNA nucleosides from radioactive-labeled cells. L-[2-14C] methionine will selectively label am psi in eukaryotic 18S rRNA. Using HPLC, we found a single 14C-labeled nucleotide in digests of 18S rRNA.

Allozymic Variation and Linkage Disequilibrium in Some Laboratory Populations of DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,17248953,,"Nine laboratory populations of D. melanogaster were surveyed by starch gel electrophoresis for variation at 17 enzyme loci. A single-fly extract could be assayed for all 17 enzymes, so that the data consist of 17-locus genotypes.--Pairwise linkage disequilibria were estimated from the multilocus genotypic frequencies, using both Burrows' and Hill's methods. Large amounts of linkage disequilibrium were found, in contrast to the results reported for natural populations.-Knowledge of the approximate sizes of these populations was used to compare the observed heterozygosities and linkage disequilibria with predictions of the neutral allele hypothesis. The relatively large amount of linkage disequilibrium is consistent with the small sizes of the populations. However, the levels of heterozygosity in at least some populations suggest that some mechanism has been operating to retard the rate of decay by random drift. Several examples of significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg frequencies and the large amount of linkage disequilibrum present in these populations indicate that a likely mechanism is selective effects associated with neutral alleles because of linkage disequilibrium with selected loci (e.g., ""associative overdominance""). The results are therefore consistent with both neutralist, and selectionist hypotheses, but suggest the importance of considering linkage disequilibrium between neutral and selected loci when attempting to explain the dynamics of enzyme polymorphisms.",1979,"C C Laurie-Ahlberg, B S Weir, C C Laurie-Ahlberg, B S Weir"

The developmental times of the other five genotypes, which produced active alcohol dehydrogenases, increased slightly at pentenol concentrations up to 0-0033%, but above this concentration they decreased markedly. In fact on 0-067% pentenol, the highest concentration tested, developmental times of these five genotypes were between 9 and 24 h less than their developmental times on media lacking pentenol. The magnitude of the reduction in developmental time differed significantly between genotypes and was positively correlated with alcohol dehydrogenase activity. Pentenol had toxic effects on adults and significant differences were found between survival percentages of adults of different genotypes on pentenol-impregnated media. These survival percentages were negatively correlated with alcohol dehydrogenase activities. Therefore selective differences between genotypes in adult survival were negatively correlated with those in developmental times. The variations in the direction of selection are discussed in terms of their possible biochemical basis and their effects on the maintenance of Adh polymorphisms.",1977,"J G Oakeshott, J G Oakeshott"
Ubiquitin-interacting motifs of ataxin-3 regulate its polyglutamine toxicity through Hsc70-4-dependent aggregation,32955441,10.7554/eLife.60742,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) belongs to the family of polyglutamine neurodegenerations. Each disorder stems from the abnormal lengthening of a glutamine repeat in a different protein. Although caused by a similar mutation, polyglutamine disorders are distinct, implicating non-polyglutamine regions of disease proteins as regulators of pathogenesis. SCA3 is caused by polyglutamine expansion in ataxin-3. To determine the role of ataxin-3's non-polyglutamine domains in disease, we utilized a new, allelic series of Drosophila melanogaster. We found that ataxin-3 pathogenicity is saliently controlled by polyglutamine-adjacent ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) that enhance aggregation and toxicity. UIMs function by interacting with the heat shock protein, Hsc70-4, whose reduction diminishes ataxin-3 toxicity in a UIM-dependent manner. Hsc70-4 also enhances pathogenicity of other polyglutamine proteins. Our studies provide a unique insight into the impact of ataxin-3 domains in SCA3, identify Hsc70-4 as a SCA3 enhancer, and indicate pleiotropic effects from HSP70 chaperones, which are generally thought to suppress polyglutamine degeneration.",2020,"Sean L Johnson, Bedri Ranxhi, Kozeta Libohova, Wei-Ling Tsou, Sokol V Todi, Sean L Johnson, Bedri Ranxhi, Kozeta Libohova, Wei-Ling Tsou, Sokol V Todi"
The age- and sex-specific decline of the 20s proteasome and the Nrf2/CncC signal transduction pathway in adaption and resistance to oxidative stress in Drosophila melanogaster,28373600,10.18632/aging.101218,"Hallmarks of aging include loss of protein homeostasis and dysregulation of stress-adaptive pathways. Loss of adaptive homeostasis, increases accumulation of DNA, protein, and lipid damage. During acute stress, the Cnc-C (Drosophila Nrf2 orthologue) transcriptionally-regulated 20S proteasome degrades damaged proteins in an ATP-independent manner. Exposure to very low, non-toxic, signaling concentrations of the redox-signaling agent hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) cause adaptive increases in the de novo expression and proteolytic activity/capacity of the 20S proteasome in female D. melanogaster (fruit-flies). Female 20S proteasome induction was accompanied by increased tolerance to a subsequent normally toxic but sub-lethal amount of H2O2, and blocking adaptive increases in proteasome expression also prevented full adaptation. We find, however, that this adaptive response is both sex- and age-dependent. Both increased proteasome expression and activity, and increased oxidative-stress resistance, in female flies, were lost with age. In contrast, male flies exhibited no H2O2 adaptation, irrespective of age. Furthermore, aging caused a generalized increase in basal 20S proteasome expression, but proteolytic activity and adaptation were both compromised. Finally, continual knockdown of Keep1 (the cytosolic inhibitor of Cnc-C) in adults resulted in older flies with greater stress resistance than their age-matched controls, but who still exhibited an age-associated loss of adaptive homeostasis.",2017,"Laura C D Pomatto, Sarah Wong, Caroline Carney, Brenda Shen, John Tower, Kelvin J A Davies, Laura C D Pomatto, Sarah Wong, Caroline Carney, Brenda Shen, John Tower, Kelvin J A Davies"
An investigation of the molecular and biochemical basis underlying chlorantraniliprole-resistant Drosophila strains and their cross-resistance to other insecticides,30397935,10.1002/arch.21514,"Chlorantraniliprole is an anthranilic diamide insecticide that binds to the insect ryanodine receptor (RyR) and induces an uncontrolled release of Ca2+ , resulting in paralysis and ultimately death of the target insects. Recently, it was reported that chlorantraniliprole-resistant diamondback moths, Plutella xylostella Linnaeus, have mutations in their RyR. In this study, we developed two different chlorantraniliprole-resistant Drosophila melanogaster strain. The resistance ratio (RR) of the low-concentration chlorantraniliprole-treated resistant (Low-Res) strain was 2.3, while that of the high-concentration chlorantraniliprole-treated resistant (High-Res) strain was 21.3. The LC 50 of the untreated control (Con) strain was 23.8~25.9 ppm, which was significantly higher than that reported for the susceptible diamondback moth (0.03~0.51 ppm). The high LC 50 of the Con may be because the helix S2 amino acid sequence of D. melanogaster RyR ( DmRyR) is identical to the I4790M mutation of the chlorantraniliprole-resistant diamondback moths, resulting in a lower binding affinity of DmRyR for chlorantraniliprole. Among the tested detoxification enzymes, the activity of esterase was significantly increased in the two Res strains, but glutathione S-transferases and acetylcholinesterase were significantly decreased in the two Res strains. The cross-resistance of the High-Res strain to other insecticides with different modes of actions (MoAs) revealed that the RRs of the neuronal acetylcholine receptor allosteric and competitive modulators were significantly increased, while those of the Na 2+ channel modulators were significantly reduced. Our studies showed that RRs against the same insecticide vary with the treatment concentration, and that RRs against other insecticides with different MoAs can be altered.",2018,"A-Young Kim, Deok Ho Kwon, In Hong Jeong, Young Ho Koh, A-Young Kim, Deok Ho Kwon, In Hong Jeong, Young Ho Koh"
"Acquisition and amplification of a testis-expressed autosomal gene, SSL, by the Drosophila Y chromosome",9177211,10.1073/pnas.94.12.6297,"The acquisition of autosomal fertility genes has been proposed to be an important process in human Y chromosome evolution. For example, the Y-linked fertility factor DAZ (Deleted in Azoospermia) appears to have arisen after the transposition and tandem amplification of the autosomal DAZH gene. The Drosophila melanogaster Y chromosome contains tandemly repeated Su(Ste) units that are thought to affect male fertility as suppressors of the homologous X-linked Stellate repeats. Here we report the detection of a testis-expressed autosomal gene, SSL [Su(Ste)-like], that appears to be an ancestor of the Y-linked Su(Ste) units. SSL encodes a casein kinase 2 (CK2) beta-subunit-like protein. Its putative ORF shares extensive (45%) homology with the genuine beta-subunit of CK2 and retains the conserved C-terminal and Glu/Asp-rich domains that are essential for CK2 holoenzyme regulation. SSL maps within region 60D1-2 of D. melanogaster and D. simulans polytene chromosomes. We present evidence that SSL was derived from the genuine betaCK2 gene by reverse transcription. This event resulted in the loss of the first three introns in the coding region of the SSL ancestor gene. Evolutionary analysis indicates that SSL has evolved under selective pressure at the translational level. Its sequence, especially in the 3' region, is much closer to the Y-linked Su(Ste) tandem repeats than to the betaCK2 gene. These results suggest that the acquisition of testis-specific autosomal genes may be important for the evolution of Drosophila as well as human Y chromosomes.",1997,"A I Kalmykova, Y Y Shevelyov, A A Dobritsa, V A Gvozdev, A I Kalmykova, Y Y Shevelyov, A A Dobritsa, V A Gvozdev"

A genome-wide inventory of neurohormone GPCRs in the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum,18054377,10.1016/j.yfrne.2007.10.003,"Insect neurohormones (biogenic amines, neuropeptides, and protein hormones) and their G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play a central role in the control of behavior, reproduction, development, feeding and many other physiological processes. The recent completion of several insect genome projects has enabled us to obtain a complete inventory of neurohormone GPCRs in these insects and, by a comparative genomics approach, to analyze the evolution of these proteins. The red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum is the latest addition to the list of insects with a sequenced genome and the first coleopteran (beetle) to be sequenced. Coleoptera is the largest insect order and about 30% of all animal species living on earth are coleopterans. Some coleopterans are severe agricultural pests, which is also true for T. castaneum, a global pest for stored grain and other dried commodities for human consumption. In addition, T. castaneum is a model for insect development. Here, we have investigated the presence of neurohormone GPCRs in Tribolium and compared them with those from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera) and the honey bee Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera). We found 20 biogenic amine GPCRs in Tribolium (21 in Drosophila; 19 in the honey bee), 48 neuropeptide GPCRs (45 in Drosophila; 35 in the honey bee), and 4 protein hormone GPCRs (4 in Drosophila; 2 in the honey bee). Furthermore, we identified the likely ligands for 45 of these 72 Tribolium GPCRs. A highly interesting finding in Tribolium was the occurrence of a vasopressin GPCR and a vasopressin peptide. So far, the vasopressin/GPCR couple has not been detected in any other insect with a sequenced genome (D. melanogaster and six other Drosophila species, Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti, Bombyx mori, and A. mellifera). Tribolium lives in very dry environments. Vasopressin in mammals is the major neurohormone steering water reabsorption in the kidneys. Its presence in Tribolium, therefore, might be related to the animal's need to effectively control water reabsorption. Other striking differences between Tribolium and the other two insects are the absence of the allatostatin-A, kinin, and corazonin neuropeptide/receptor couples and the duplications of other hormonal systems. Our survey of 340 million years of insect neurohormone GPCR evolution shows that neuropeptide/receptor couples can easily duplicate or disappear during insect evolution. It also shows that Drosophila is not a good representative of all insects, because several of the hormonal systems that we now find in Tribolium do not exist in Drosophila.",2008,"Frank Hauser, Giuseppe Cazzamali, Michael Williamson, Yoonseong Park, Bin Li, Yoshiaki Tanaka, Reinhard Predel, Susanne Neupert, Joachim Schachtner, Peter Verleyen, Cornelis J P Grimmelikhuijzen, Frank Hauser, Giuseppe Cazzamali, Michael Williamson, Yoonseong Park, Bin Li, Yoshiaki Tanaka, Reinhard Predel, Susanne Neupert, Joachim Schachtner, Peter Verleyen, Cornelis J P Grimmelikhuijzen"

Induction of biochemical stress markers and apoptosis in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster against complex chemical mixtures: role of reactive oxygen species,17651711,10.1016/j.cbi.2007.06.035,"The study was aimed to investigate the effect of leachates of solid waste from a flashlight battery factory and a pigment plant on 70 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) expression, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidant enzymes activities and apoptosis in Drosophila. Third instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster transgenic for hsp70 (hsp70-lacZ) were fed on diet mixed with leachates of solid wastes (0.05-2.0%, v/v) released from two industrial plants at three different pHs (7.00, 4.93 and 2.88) for 2-48 h. A concentration- and time-dependent significant change in Hsp70 expression, ROS generation, antioxidant enzymes activities and MDA content was observed in the exposed larvae preceding the antioxidant enzymes activities. Mitochondria-mediated, caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death in the larvae exposed to 1.0 and 2.0% leachates of flashlight battery factory was concurrent with a significant regression in Hsp70 expression and a higher ROS generation. A positive correlation drawn between ROS generation and apoptotic markers and a negative correlation between apoptotic markers and Hsp70 expression in these groups indicated the important role of ROS in the leachate-induced cellular damage. Hsp70 along with antioxidant enzymes offered protection to the organisms exposed to all the tested concentrations of the leachates of pigment plant waste and 0.5% leachate of flashlight battery factory in a cooperative manner when ROS generation was less induced. Conversely, higher levels of ROS generation in the organisms treated with 1.0 and 2.0% leachate of flashlight battery factory after 24 and 48 h resulted in regression of Hsp70 expression in them leading to cell death. The study suggests that (1) leachates of flashlight battery factory waste more adversely affected the organisms in comparison to the leachates of pigment plant waste. (2) Hsp70 may be used as a biomarker of cellular damage in organisms exposed to leachates.

Nuclear genomic control of naturally occurring variation in mitochondrial function in Drosophila melanogaster,23171078,10.1186/1471-2164-13-659,"Background:
      
    

    
      Mitochondria are organelles found in nearly all eukaryotic cells that play a crucial role in cellular survival and function. Mitochondrial function is under the control of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. While the latter has been the focus of most genetic research, we remain largely ignorant about the nuclear-encoded genomic control of inter-individual variability in mitochondrial function. Here, we used Drosophila melanogaster as our model organism to address this question.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We quantified mitochondrial state 3 and state 4 respiration rates and P:O ratio in mitochondria isolated from the thoraces of 40 sequenced inbred lines of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel. We found significant within-population genetic variability for all mitochondrial traits. Hence, we performed genome-wide association mapping and identified 141 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with differences in mitochondrial respiration and efficiency (P ≤1 × 10-5). Gene-centered regression models showed that 2-3 SNPs can explain 31, 13, and 18% of the phenotypic variation in state 3, state 4, and P:O ratio, respectively. Most of the genes tagged by the SNPs are involved in organ development, second messenger-mediated signaling pathways, and cytoskeleton remodeling. One of these genes, sallimus (sls), encodes a component of the muscle sarcomere. We confirmed the direct effect of sls on mitochondrial respiration using two viable mutants and their coisogenic wild-type strain. Furthermore, correlation network analysis revealed that sls functions as a transcriptional hub in a co-regulated module associated with mitochondrial respiration and is connected to CG7834, which is predicted to encode a protein with mitochondrial electron transfer flavoprotein activity. This latter finding was also verified in the sls mutants.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our results provide novel insights into the genetic factors regulating natural variation in mitochondrial function in D. melanogaster. The integrative genomic approach used in our study allowed us to identify sls as a novel hub gene responsible for the regulation of mitochondrial respiration in muscle sarcomere and to provide evidence that sls might act via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex.",2012,"Patricia Jumbo-Lucioni, Su Bu, Susan T Harbison, Juanita C Slaughter, Trudy F C Mackay, Douglas R Moellering, Maria De Luca, Patricia Jumbo-Lucioni, Su Bu, Susan T Harbison, Juanita C Slaughter, Trudy F C Mackay, Douglas R Moellering, Maria De Luca"
Identification of a genetic network for an ecologically relevant behavioural phenotype in Drosophila melanogaster,31867742,10.1111/mec.15341,"Pupation site choice of Drosophila third-instar larvae is critical for the survival of individuals, as pupae are exposed to various biotic and abiotic dangers while immobilized during the 3-4 days of metamorphosis. This singular behavioural choice is sensitive to both environmental and genetic factors. Here, we developed a high-throughput phenotyping approach to assay the variation in pupation height in Drosophila melanogaster, while controlling for possibly confounding factors. We find substantial variation of mean pupation height among sampled natural stocks and we show that the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) reflects this variation. Using the DGRP stocks for genome-wide association (GWA) mapping, 16 loci involved in determining pupation height could be resolved. The candidate genes in these loci are enriched for high expression in the larval central nervous system. A genetic network could be constructed from the candidate loci, which places scribble (scrib) at the centre, plus other genes known to be involved in nervous system development, such as Epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) and p53. Using gene disruption lines, we could functionally validate several of the initially identified loci, as well as additional loci predicted from network analysis. Our study shows that the combination of high-throughput phenotyping with a genetic analysis of variation captured from the wild can be used to approach the genetic dissection of an environmentally relevant behavioural phenotype.",2020,"Wenyu Zhang, Guy Richard Reeves, Diethard Tautz, Wenyu Zhang, Guy Richard Reeves, Diethard Tautz"
Identification and In Vivo Characterisation of Cardioactive Peptides in Drosophila melanogaster,30577424,10.3390/ijms20010002,"Neuropeptides and peptide hormones serve as critical regulators of numerous biological processes, including development, growth, reproduction, physiology, and behaviour. In mammals, peptidergic regulatory systems are complex and often involve multiple peptides that act at different levels and relay to different receptors. To improve the mechanistic understanding of such complex systems, invertebrate models in which evolutionarily conserved peptides and receptors regulate similar biological processes but in a less complex manner have emerged as highly valuable. Drosophila melanogaster represents a favoured model for the characterisation of novel peptidergic signalling events and for evaluating the relevance of those events in vivo. In the present study, we analysed a set of neuropeptides and peptide hormones for their ability to modulate cardiac function in semi-intact larval Drosophila melanogaster. We identified numerous peptides that significantly affected heart parameters such as heart rate, systolic and diastolic interval, rhythmicity, and contractility. Thus, peptidergic regulation of the Drosophila heart is not restricted to chronotropic adaptation but also includes inotropic modulation. By specifically interfering with the expression of corresponding peptides in transgenic animals, we assessed the in vivo relevance of the respective peptidergic regulation. Based on the functional conservation of certain peptides throughout the animal kingdom, the identified cardiomodulatory activities may be relevant not only to proper heart function in Drosophila, but also to corresponding processes in vertebrates, including humans.",2018,"Ronja Schiemann, Kay Lammers, Maren Janz, Jana Lohmann, Achim Paululat, Heiko Meyer, Ronja Schiemann, Kay Lammers, Maren Janz, Jana Lohmann, Achim Paululat, Heiko Meyer"

Fifty percent lethality 2 days postirradiation (LD(50/2)) in wild-type 1-day-old adult fruit flies was approximately 1238 Gy for males and 1339 Gy for females. We observed a significant age-dependent decline in the radiation resistance of both males and females. Radiation damage is postulated to occur by the generation of oxygen radicals. An age-related decline in the ability of flies to resist an agent that induces oxygen radicals, paraquat, was observed when comparing 10- and 20-day adults. Female flies are more resistant to paraquat than male flies. Oxidative stress mediated by paraquat was additive with sublethal exposures to radiation in young adults. Therefore, the ability to repair the damage caused by oxygen radicals seems to decline with the age of the flies. Because Drosophila adults are largely post-mitotic, our data suggest that adult Drosophila melanogaster can serve as an excellent model to study the factors responsible for radiation resistance in post-mitotic tissue and age-dependent changes in this resistance.",2008,"Vijay Parashar, Stewart Frankel, Alan G Lurie, Blanka Rogina, Vijay Parashar, Stewart Frankel, Alan G Lurie, Blanka Rogina"
Adaptation of A-to-I RNA editing in Drosophila,28282384,10.1371/journal.pgen.1006648,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing is hypothesized to facilitate adaptive evolution by expanding proteomic diversity through an epigenetic approach. However, it is challenging to provide evidences to support this hypothesis at the whole editome level. In this study, we systematically characterized 2,114 A-to-I RNA editing sites in female and male brains of D. melanogaster, and nearly half of these sites had events evolutionarily conserved across Drosophila species. We detected strong signatures of positive selection on the nonsynonymous editing sites in Drosophila brains, and the beneficial editing sites were significantly enriched in genes related to chemical and electrical neurotransmission. The signal of adaptation was even more pronounced for the editing sites located in X chromosome or for those commonly observed across Drosophila species. We identified a set of gene candidates (termed ""PSEB"" genes) that had nonsynonymous editing events favored by natural selection. We presented evidence that editing preferentially increased mutation sequence space of evolutionarily conserved genes, which supported the adaptive evolution hypothesis of editing. We found prevalent nonsynonymous editing sites that were favored by natural selection in female and male adults from five strains of D. melanogaster. We showed that temperature played a more important role than gender effect in shaping the editing levels, although the effect of temperature is relatively weaker compared to that of species effect. We also explored the relevant factors that shape the selective patterns of the global editomes. Altogether we demonstrated that abundant nonsynonymous editing sites in Drosophila brains were adaptive and maintained by natural selection during evolution. Our results shed new light on the evolutionary principles and functional consequences of RNA editing.",2017,"Yuange Duan, Shengqian Dou, Shiqi Luo, Hong Zhang, Jian Lu, Yuange Duan, Shengqian Dou, Shiqi Luo, Hong Zhang, Jian Lu"
Biogeography of Drosophila (Diptera: Drosophilidae) in East and Southeast Asia,26078303,10.1093/jisesa/iev056,"The causes of high biological diversity in biodiversity hotspots have long been a major subject of study in conservation biology. To investigate this matter, we conducted a phylogeographic study of five Drosophila (Diptera: Drosophilidae) species from East and Southeast Asia: Drosophila albomicans Duda, D. formosana Duda, D. immigrans Sturtevant, D. melanogaster Meigen, and D. simulans Sturtevant. We collected 185 samples from 28 localities in eight countries. From each collected individual, we sequenced the autosomal extra sex comb gene (esc) and seven mitochondrial genes, including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate-reductase dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4), ND4L, tRNA-His, tRNA-Pro, tRNA-Thr, partial ND5, and partial ND6. Phylogenetic analyses using maximum- likelihood and Bayesian methods revealed interesting population structure and identified the existence of two distinct D. formosana lineages (Southeast Asian and Taiwanese populations). Genetic differentiation among groups of D. immigrans suggests the possibility of endemic speciation in Taiwan. In contrast, D. melanogaster remained one extensively large population throughout East and Southeast Asia, including nearby islets. A molecular clock was used to estimate divergence times, which were compared with past geographical events to infer evolutionary scenarios. Our findings suggest that interglacial periods may have caused population isolation, thus enhancing population differentiation more strongly for some of the Drosophila species. The population structure of each Drosophila species in East and Southeast Asia has been influenced by past geographic events.",2015,"Fu-Guo Robert Liu, Shun-Chern Tsaur, Hsiao-Ting Huang, Fu-Guo Robert Liu, Shun-Chern Tsaur, Hsiao-Ting Huang"
Eyes absent in the cockroach panoistic ovaries regulates proliferation and differentiation through ecdysone signalling,32417417,10.1016/j.ibmb.2020.103407,"Eyes absent (Eya), is a protein structurally conserved from hydrozoans to humans, for which two basic roles have been reported: it can act as a transcription cofactor and as a protein tyrosine phosphatase. Eya was discovered in the fly Drosophila melanogaster in relation to its function in eye development, and the same function was later reported in other insects. Eya is also involved in insect oogenesis, although studies in this sense are limited to D. melanogaster, which has meroistic ovaries, and where eya mutations abolish gonad formation. In the present work we studied the function of eya in the panoistic ovary of the cockroach Blattella germanica. We show that eya is essential for correct development of panoistic ovaries. In B. germanica, eya acts at different level and in a distinct way in the germarium and the vitellarium. In the germarium, eya contributes to maintain the correct number of somatic and germinal cells by regulating the expression of steroidogenic genes in the ovary. In the vitellarium, eya facilitates follicle cells proliferation and contributes to regulate the cell program, in the context of basal ovarian follicle maturation. Thus, eya-depleted females of B. germanica arrest the growth and maturation of basal ovarian follicles and become sterile.",2020,"S Ramos, F Chelemen, V Pagone, N Elshaer, P Irles, M D Piulachs, S Ramos, F Chelemen, V Pagone, N Elshaer, P Irles, M D Piulachs"
Structures reveal opening of the store-operated calcium channel Orai,30160233,10.7554/eLife.36758,"The store-operated calcium (Ca2+) channel Orai governs Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane of many non-excitable cells in metazoans. The channel opens in response to the depletion of Ca2+ stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Loss- and gain-of-function mutants of Orai cause disease. Our previous work revealed the structure of Orai with a closed pore. Here, using a gain-of-function mutation that constitutively activates the channel, we present an X-ray structure of Drosophila melanogaster Orai in an open conformation. Well-defined electron density maps reveal that the pore is dramatically dilated on its cytosolic side in comparison to the slender closed pore. Cations and anions bind in different regions of the open pore, informing mechanisms for ion permeation and Ca2+ selectivity. Opening of the pore requires the release of cytosolic latches. Together with additional X-ray structures of an unlatched-but-closed conformation, we propose a sequence for store-operated activation.",2018,"Xiaowei Hou, Shana R Burstein, Stephen Barstow Long, Xiaowei Hou, Shana R Burstein, Stephen Barstow Long"
New Methods for Inferring the Distribution of Fitness Effects for INDELs and SNPs,29635416,10.1093/molbev/msy054,"Small insertions and deletions (INDELs; ≤50 bp) are the most common type of variability after single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). However, compared with SNPs, we know little about the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new INDEL mutations and how prevalent adaptive INDEL substitutions are. Studying INDELs has been difficult partly because identifying ancestral states at these sites is error-prone and misidentification can lead to severely biased estimates of the strength of selection. To solve these problems, we develop new maximum likelihood methods, which use polymorphism data to simultaneously estimate the DFE, the mutation rate, and the misidentification rate. These methods are applicable to both INDELs and SNPs. Simulations show that they can provide highly accurate results. We applied the methods to an INDEL polymorphism data set in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that the DFE for polymorphic INDELs in protein-coding regions is bimodal, with the variants being either nearly neutral or strongly deleterious. Based on the DFE, we estimated that 71.5-83.7% of the INDEL substitutions that took place along the D. melanogaster lineage were fixed by positive selection, which is comparable with the prevalence of adaptive substitutions at nonsynonymous sites. The new methods have been implemented in the software package anavar.",2018,"Henry J Barton, Kai Zeng, Henry J Barton, Kai Zeng"
Cucurbitacin B acts a potential insect growth regulator by antagonizing 20-hydroxyecdysone activity,29205800,10.1002/ps.4817,"Background:
      
    

    
      20-Hydroxyecdysone (20E), a crucial insect steroid hormone, can bind to its cognate nuclear receptor composed of ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle (USP) to activate expression of 20E-response genes, enabling subsequent metamorphosis. In this study, we tried to find out which steroid-like compounds can block insect metamorphosis effectively and provide useful information for biopesticide study. For this purpose, we screened 126 steroid-like compounds for possible 20E antagonists using a dual-luciferase reporter assay with Drosophila melanogaster Kc and Bombyx mori Bm12 cells.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Among 126 steroid-like compounds, three cucurbitacins (CucB, D and E) were identified as 20E antagonists in both Kc and Bm12 cells. Notably, CucB caused significant molting defects and mortality in both B. mori and D. melanogaster larvae, and dramatically hindered larval growth of Helicoverpa armigera by its anti-feeding activity.

A mechanism for sickness sleep: lessons from invertebrates,28028818,10.1113/JP273009,"During health, animal sleep is regulated by an internal clock and by the duration of prior wakefulness. During sickness, sleep is regulated by cytokines released from either peripheral cells or from cells within the nervous system. These cytokines regulate central nervous system neurons to induce sleep. Recent research in the invertebrates Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster has led to new insights into the mechanism of sleep during sickness. Sickness is triggered by exposure to environments such as infection, heat, or ultraviolet light irradiation, all of which cause cellular stress. Epidermal growth factor is released from stressed cells and signals to activate central neuroendocrine cell(s). These neuron(s) release neuropeptides including those containing an amidated arginine(R)-phenylalanine(F) motif at their C-termini (RFamide peptides). Importantly, mechanisms regulating sickness sleep are partially distinct from those regulating healthy sleep. We will here review key findings that have elucidated the central neuroendocrine mechanism of sleep during sickness. Adaptive mechanisms employed in the control of sickness sleep may play a role in correcting cellular homeostasis after various insults. We speculate that these mechanisms may play a maladaptive role in human pathological conditions such as in the fatigue and anorexia associated with autoimmune diseases, with major depression, and with unexplained chronic fatigue.",2017,"Kristen C Davis, David M Raizen, Kristen C Davis, David M Raizen"
O-GlcNAc reports ambient temperature and confers heat resistance on ectotherm development,24706800,10.1073/pnas.1322396111,"Effects of temperature on biological processes are complex. Diffusion is less affected than the diverse enzymatic reactions that have distinct individual temperature profiles. Hence thermal fluctuations pose a formidable challenge to ectothermic organisms in which body temperature is largely dictated by the ambient temperature. How cells in ectotherms cope with the myriad disruptive effects of temperature variation is poorly understood at the molecular level. Here we show that nucleocytoplasmic posttranslational modification of proteins with O-linked GlcNAc (O-GlcNAc) is closely correlated with ambient temperature during development of distantly related ectotherms ranging from the insect Drosophila melanogaster to the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to the fish Danio rerio. Regulation seems to occur at the level of activity of the only two enzymes, O-GlcNAc transferase and O-GlcNAcase, that add and remove, respectively, this posttranslational modification in nucleus and cytoplasm. With genetic approaches in D. melanogaster and C. elegans, we demonstrate the importance of high levels of this posttranslational modification for successful development at elevated temperatures. Because many cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins in diverse pathways are O-GlcNAc targets, temperature-dependent regulation of this modification might contribute to an efficient coordinate adjustment of cellular processes in response to thermal change.",2014,"Pablo T Radermacher, Faina Myachina, Fritz Bosshardt, Rahul Pandey, Daniel Mariappa, H-Arno J Müller, Christian F Lehner, Pablo T Radermacher, Faina Myachina, Fritz Bosshardt, Rahul Pandey, Daniel Mariappa, H-Arno J Müller, Christian F Lehner"
Short indels are subject to insertion-biased gene conversion,24033170,10.1111/evo.12129,"Recombination between homologous loci is accompanied by formation of heteroduplexes. Repairing mismatches in heteroduplexes often leads to single nucleotide substitutions in a process known as gene conversion. Gene conversion was shown to be GC-biased in different organisms; that is, a W(A or T)→S(G or C) substitution is more likely in this process than a S→W substitution. Here, we show that the insertion/deletion ratio for short noncoding indels that reach fixation between species is positively correlated with the recombination rate in Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This correlation is both due to an increase of the fixation rate of insertions and decrease of the fixation rate of deletions in regions of high recombination. Whole-genome data on indel polymorphism and divergence in D. melanogaster rule out mutation biases and selection as the cause of this trend, pointing to insertion-biased gene conversion as the most likely explanation. The bias toward insertions is the strongest for single-nucleotide indels, and decreases with indel length. In regions of high recombination rate this bias leads to an up to ∼5-fold excess of fixed short insertions over deletions, and substantially affects the evolution of DNA segments.",2013,"Evgeny V Leushkin, Georgii A Bazykin, Evgeny V Leushkin, Georgii A Bazykin"

Recombination has a large impact on diversity of this protein including positive selection which is major constraint on protein evolution.

Mechanisms proposed for obtaining the requisite precision range from simple models with few parameters to more complex models involving many regulated quantities. The synthesis-diffusion-degradation (SDD) model is a relatively simple model explaining the formation of the Bicoid gradient in Drosophila melanogaster, in which the steady-state characteristic length of the gradient is determined solely by the rates of diffusion and degradation of the morphogen. In this work, we test the SDD model in unfertilized D. melanogaster eggs, which contain a single female pronucleus and lack the nuclear division cycles and other zygotic regulatory processes seen in fertilized eggs. Using two-photon live imaging as well as a novel method for quantitative imaging based on decorrelation of photoswitching waveforms, we find that the Bicoid gradient is longer and shallower in unfertilized eggs as compared to the gradient at the same time points in fertilized eggs. Using a means of measuring the Bicoid lifetime by conjugation to a photoconvertible fluorophore, we find that the lifetime is correspondingly longer in unfertilized eggs, providing qualitative and quantitative agreement with the predictions of the SDD model.",2012,"J A Drocco, E F Wieschaus, D W Tank, J A Drocco, E F Wieschaus, D W Tank"
Estimating divergence parameters with small samples from a large number of loci,19917765,10.1534/genetics.109.110528,"Most methods for studying divergence with gene flow rely upon data from many individuals at few loci. Such data can be useful for inferring recent population history but they are unlikely to contain sufficient information about older events. However, the growing availability of genome sequences suggests a different kind of sampling scheme, one that may be more suited to studying relatively ancient divergence. Data sets extracted from whole-genome alignments may represent very few individuals but contain a very large number of loci. To take advantage of such data we developed a new maximum-likelihood method for genomic data under the isolation-with-migration model. Unlike many coalescent-based likelihood methods, our method does not rely on Monte Carlo sampling of genealogies, but rather provides a precise calculation of the likelihood by numerical integration over all genealogies. We demonstrate that the method works well on simulated data sets. We also consider two models for accommodating mutation rate variation among loci and find that the model that treats mutation rates as random variables leads to better estimates.

Subcellular localization of the protein studied using anti-Misato antibody suggested that it is localized to the mitochondria. Further experiments of fractionating mitochondria revealed that Misato was localized to the outer membrane. The transfection of Misato siRNA led to growth deficiencies compared with control siRNA transfected HeLa cells, and the Misato-depleted HeLa cells showed apoptotic nuclear fragmentation resulting in cell death. After silencing of Misato, the filamentous mitochondrial network disappeared and fragmented mitochondria were observed, indicating human Misato has a role in mitochondrial fusion.

[Fertility of Drosophila melanogaster females affected by mutation l(2)M167DTS],16523657,,"We studied the fertility of D. melanogaster females heterozygous for the dominant temperature sensitive mutation l(2)M167DTS, which exerts a recessive lethal effect at 25 degrees C, under the conditions of stable temperature regimes 25, 28, and 29 degrees C and changing regimes 25-->29 degrees C and 29-->25 degrees C. It was shown that inhibition of total activity of oogenesis due to a decreased number of functioning ovarioles is one of the mechanisms underlying the decreased fertility of l(2)M167DTS /+ females. Analysis of individual fertility of each female confirmed also the role of sterility as a component of fertility of the females. Sterilization was realized due both to full depletion of functioning ovarioles and disturbed mechanism of laying the mature eggs onto a substrate as a result of violation of the feedback blocking normal ovulation, which led to the breakdown of ovarioles and filling of the abdominal cavity with mature oocytes. A significant polymorphism of heterozygous females by their fertility was observed.

Chromosomal analysis of D. melanogaster long-term selected lines,8440889,10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a111278,"Crosses and chromosomal substitutions among five selected lines of Drosophila melanogaster were carried out. These lines came from the same natural population after long-term selection for increasing dorsocentral bristle number. Two of them (Ac-27S and Ac-27P) show a bristle number around 16, and the other three (S-27S, S-27P, and N-21) present very extreme phenotypes, between 35 and 40 bristles. Selected genes were located on the three major chromosomes. Recessivity and synergistic interactions among the selected chromosomes account for the existence of hidden genetic variability, which can be released by selection, for a trait that scarcely shows phenotypic variability in populations. Genes responsible for selection response in lines Ac-27S and Ac-27P are present in all the selected lines, while lines S-27S, S-27P, and N-21 have accumulated additional increasing alleles common to the three of them. Long-term response and the extreme phenotypes achieved by these three lines point to variation that arose de novo during the selection process.

Present studies included the testing of Muscids, Sphaerocerids, and Phorids, none of which were able to support P mobility. A new excision indicator plasmid was developed allowing the detection and recovery of virtually all P-element excision products. The frequency and sequence analysis of excision products from Drosophila melanogaster and another drosophilid, Chymomyza procnemis, indicated both quantitative and qualitative differences in the activity of transposase. The quantitative relationships observed in the original assay were maintained, and qualitative differences in transposase activity were reflected in the sequence of the empty donor sites. The results suggest that host factors are involved in cutting and ligating P-element DNA during excision, with transposase facilitating these processes. Possible limitations on P mobility by abnormal transposase transcript processing were tested in Anastrepha suspensa using transposase-encoding plasmids having deleted intron sequences. A transposase cDNA supported normal P excision in D. melanogaster, and a low level of mobility in A. suspensa.

Micro-evolution in a wine cellar population: an historical perspective,8119593,10.1007/BF01435040,"The population of Drosophila melanogaster inside the wine cellar of Chateau Tahbilk of Victoria, Australia was found by McKenzie and Parsons (1974) to have undergone microevolution for greater alcohol tolerance when compared to the neighboring population outside the cellar. This triggered additional studies at Tahbilk, and at other wine cellars throughout the world. The contributions and interactions of researchers and the development of ideas on the ecology and genetics of this unique experimental system are traced. Although the ADH-F/ADH-S polymorphism was found to be maintained by selection in the Tahbilk populations, the selection is not significantly associated with alcohol tolerance. The environment inside the Tahbilk wine cellar is not as rich in ethanol as was originally anticipated, and selection that affects the alcohol dehydrogenase polymorphism may be more concerned with the relative efficiency with which ethanol is used as a nutrient by D. melanogaster. The synthesis and modification of lipids, particularly in membranes, appears to be important to alcohol tolerance. The studies of the Tahbilk population are at a crossroad. New experimental approaches promise to provide the keys to the selection that maintains the alcohol dehydrogenase polymorphism, and to factors that are important to alcohol tolerance and stress adaptation. From these research foundations at Tahbilk very significant contributions to our future understanding of the genetic processes of evolution can be made.",1993,"S W McKechnie, B W Geer, S W McKechnie, B W Geer"
On the specificity and effects on transcription of P-element insertions at the yellow locus of Drosophila melanogaster,2835750,10.1093/nar/16.7.3039,"Fourteen P-element insertion mutants at the yellow (y) gene of D. melanogaster have been analysed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. The distribution of the insertion sites is nonrandom, with a preferred target site in the 5'-transcribed but non-translated leader of the gene. Transcription analysis indicates that P-elements inserted into the transcribed region of y can terminate y transcription. While the great majority of the P-element insertions into the preferred target site abolish y activity, this loss of activity is not due to disruption of the insertion site since imprecise excision events which do not restore the wild type sequence at the insertion site can restore y function. We further demonstrate that a mutant caused by a 221bp P-element insertion into the 5' transcribed but non-translated region, which show partial y activity, produces a larger mutant transcript consistent with it being a product of transcriptional readthrough. We present results which suggest that imprecise excision events which restore (or partially restore) y activity can occur by deleting P-element internal sequences which normally act to terminate y transcription.",1988,"G Howes, M O'Connor, W Chia, G Howes, M O'Connor, W Chia"

By statistical analysis we can generate a confidence interval for the initial point of protein assembly for a particular protein. The first point of protein assembly for S14 is located near the 5' end of the pre-18S rRNA. In contrast, the first point of protein assembly for L4 is at 0.38 unit from the initiation point (a unit being the length of a ribosomal transcription unit). The binding patterns of S14 and L4 are consistent with the 5' proximal and the 5' distal orientations of the pre-18S and the pre-28S rRNAs. The method described here provides an approach to the elucidation of the assembly of eukaryotic ribosomal proteins in vivo.",1981,"W Y Chooi, K R Leiby, W Y Chooi, K R Leiby"
Resistance of Drosophila to toxins,11112179,10.1146/annurev.ento.46.1.545,"Insects, including Drosophila, readily respond to toxins such as phytotoxins, metal ions, and insecticides in their environment by evolving resistance. Although Drosophila are seldom targets for insecticides, nevertheless populations worldwide have evolved resistance to a variety of insecticides, and these resistance alleles persist in high frequency. In many cases, Drosophila use the same genetic and biochemical mechanisms that underlie resistance in pest insects, including single-site changes in target molecules resulting from point mutations and upregulation of degradative enzymes, particularly cytochrome P450 enzymes and glutathione S-transferases. However, several types of resistance found in pest insects, such as gene amplification and knock-down resistance, have not been reported in Drosophila field populations. Excellent Drosophila-plant models are being studied to understand the adaptation to phytotoxins; P450 enzymes are clearly involved in phytotoxin resistance in one of these models. The genetic advantages of D. melanogaster, including availability of the sequenced genome, should allow further study of these genes and identification of new ones, particularly regulatory genes, responsible for resistance.",2001,"T G Wilson, T G Wilson"

Disruption of dopamine homeostasis has sexually dimorphic effects on senescence characteristics of Drosophila melanogaster,28112452,10.1111/ejn.13525,"The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) is known to be involved in a multitude of physiological processes. We investigated sexually dimorphic effects of disruptions in DA homeostasis and its relationship to senescence using three different Drosophila melanogaster mutants namely Catsup (Catsup26 ) with elevated DA levels, and pale (ple2 ), Punch (PuZ22 ) with depleted DA levels. In all genotypes including controls, DA levels were significantly lower in old (45-50-day-old) flies compared with young (3-5-day-old) in both sexes. Interestingly, females had lower DA content than males at young age whereas this difference was not observed in old age, suggesting that males had a larger decline in DA levels with age. Females, in general, were longer lived compared with males in all genotypes except ple2 mutants with depleted DA levels. This phenotype was abolished in the ple2 rescue flies. Interestingly, females also demonstrated marked age-related decline in circadian locomotor activity compared with males. Old Catsup26 males with elevated DA levels accumulated significantly lower levels of lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy 2-nonenal (4-HNE) compared with age-matched wild type, ple2 and PuZ22 mutant males. In Catsup26 revertant lines this phenomenon was absent. We also observed a sexually dimorphic response in the expression levels of key stress and aging associated and/or related transcription factor genes across genotypes with elevated or depleted DA levels which was reverted to wild type levels in specific rescue lines. Taken together, our results reveal a novel sexually dimorphic involvement of DA in senescence characteristics of D. melanogaster.",2017,"Andrea Bednářová, Marley E Hanna, Kuntol Rakshit, Janis M O'Donnell, Natraj Krishnan, Andrea Bednářová, Marley E Hanna, Kuntol Rakshit, Janis M O'Donnell, Natraj Krishnan"
Genotoxic effects of two nickel-compounds in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,21073980,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2010.10.008,"In view of the scarcely available information on the in vivo mutagenic and co-mutagenic activity of nickel, the genotoxic potential of two nickel-compounds, nickel chloride (NiCl(2)) and nickel sulphate (NiSO(4)), was assessed in Drosophila melanogaster by measuring two different genetic endpoints. On the one hand, we used the wing-spot assay, which is based on the principle that the loss of heterozygosity of two suitable recessive markers, multiple wing hairs (mwh) and flare-3 (flr(3)), can lead to the formation of mutant clones in the imaginal disks of larval cells. On the other hand, the in vivo comet assay, which detects single- and double-strand DNA breaks, was also used with larval haemocytes. These cells offer several advantages: they are highly sensitive to genotoxic agents, the sampling and processing methodologies are quite simple and the level of basal DNA damage is relatively low. No significant increases in the frequencies of the three categories of mutant spots (i.e. small single spots, large single spots, and twin spots) were observed in the wing-spot assay; however, NiSO(4) induced significant dose-dependent increases in DNA damage in the comet assay. In addition, the combined treatments with gamma-radiation and NiCl(2) and NiSO(4) showed a slight but significant increase in the frequency of the three categories of mutant spots compared with the frequency induced by gamma-radiation alone, indicating that both nickel compounds have a synergistic interaction. These results support the assumption that both nickel compounds could act as co-mutagens interfering with DNA-repair processes and that the in vivo comet assay is a sensitive and effective method for detecting the DNA damage induced by NiSO(4) in haemocytes of D. melanogaster.",2011,"Erico R Carmona, Amadeu Creus, R Marcos, Erico R Carmona, Amadeu Creus, R Marcos"
Extended longevity lines of Drosophila melanogaster: abundance of yolk protein gene mRNA in fat body and ovary,10363785,10.1016/s0531-5565(98)00071-0,"Lines of Drosophila melanogaster selected for late-life female reproduction typically exhibit correlated responses of reduced early fecundity and increased longevity. This relationship suggests a tradeoff between reproductive effort and somatic maintenance, which in turn, underlies some evolutionary theories of senescence. The mechanistic basis of the apparent tradeoff between increased longevity and reduced early-age fecundity has remained obscure. The present manuscript addresses the issues of whether the reduced early-age fecundity in selected lines corresponds to reduced yolk-protein mRNA production, and whether long-lived flies exhibit somatic maintenance in terms of relatively reduced yolk-protein mRNA production in the fat body. Yolk protein is one of the most abundant proteins used for female reproduction. By comparing a set of lines selected for late life reproduction with the corresponding control lines, we show that that yolk-protein gene mRNA relative abundance during the first four days posteclosion did not correspond to reduced early-life fecundity in the selected lines. In D. melanogaster, yolk protein is produced in the fat body and ovarian follicle cells. On the fourth day posteclosion, relatively more yolk-protein gene mRNA was present in the fat body. On day 1 posteclosion, supplemental yeast did not alter relative yolk-protein gene mRNA abundance. However, on day 4 posteclosion, supplemental yeast stimulated yolk-protein gene mRNA production in the fat body, which suggests an underlying mechanism for the nutrition-based phenotypic plasticity of fecundity previously documented in these lines. On medium without supplemental yeast, the relatively low abundance of fat body yolk-protein gene mRNA in the selected lines on day 4 posteclosion corresponds to a prediction derived from the disposable soma theory.",1999,"K A Carlson, L G Harshman, K A Carlson, L G Harshman"
Immunohistochemical study and western blotting analysis of titin-like proteins in the striated muscle of Drosophila melanogaster and in the striated and smooth muscle of the oligochaete Eisenia foetida,8987029,10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19961101)35:4<349::AID-JEMT6>3.0.CO;2-H,"The presence and distribution of titin-like proteins have been examined in transversely striated muscle of Drosophila melanogaster, in obliquely striated muscles (body wall and inner muscular layer of the pseudoheart) and smooth muscle (outer muscular layer of the pseudoheart) from the earthworm Eisenia foetida by means of Western blotting analysis, light microscopy immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy immunogold labeling, using antibodies anti vertebrate (chicken) titin (3,000 kDa) and arthropod (D. melanogaster) mini-titin (twitchin or projectin) (700 kDa). To determine whether these antibodies immunoreact non-specifically against vertebrate titin, mouse skeletal muscle was also studied. As negative control, mouse smooth muscle was used. Immunoreaction to mini-titin was found in all the invertebrate muscles studied. For each of these muscles, Western blotting analysis of mini-titin showed a single band, at approximately 700 kDa. Electron microscopy immunolabeling to this protein was observed along the whole sarcomere length (A bands and I bands) in both transversely striated muscles of the insect and obliquely striated muscles of the earthworm, although the number of immunogold particles was more abundant in the insect muscles. Mini-titin immunolabeling was also observed in the smooth muscle cells that formed the outer layer of the earthworm pseudoheart although in lower amounts than in the obliquely striated muscle. The absence of true sarcomeres in the smooth muscle cells did not permit to determine the extension of mini-titin immunolabeling. No immunoreaction to this protein was found in the striated and smooth muscles of the mouse. Immunoreaction to titin was only observed in the mouse skeletal muscle, in which both A bands and I bands appeared immunolabeled.

The genetic structure of natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. XX. Comparison of genotype-environment interaction in viability between a northern and a southern population,3117620,,"In order to examine the operation of diversifying selection as the maintenance mechanism of excessive additive genetic variance for viability in southern populations in comparison with northern populations of Drosophila melanogaster, two sets of experiments were conducted using second chromosomes extracted from the Ogasawara population (a southern population in Japan) and from the Aomori population (a northern population in Japan). Chromosomal homozygote and heterozygote viabilities were estimated in eight kinds of artificially produced breeding environments. The main findings in the present investigation are as follows: (1) Significant genotype-environment interaction was observed using chromosomes extracted from the Ogasawara population. Indeed, the estimate of the genotype-environment interaction variance for heterozygotes was significantly larger than that of the genotypic variance. On the other hand, when chromosomes sampled from the Aomori population were examined, that interaction variance was significant only for homozygotes and its value was no more than one quarter of that for the chromosomes from the Ogasawara population. (2) The average genetic correlation between any two viabilities of the same lines estimated in the eight kinds of breeding environments for the chromosomes sampled from the Ogasawara population was smaller than that for the chromosomes from the Aomori population both in homozygotes and in heterozygotes, especially in the latter. (3) The stability of heterozygotes over homozygotes against fluctuations of environmental conditions was seen in the chromosomes from the Ogasawara population, but not from the Aomori population. (4) From the excessive genotype-environment interaction variance compared with the genotypic variance in heterozygotes, it was suggested for the chromosomes from the Ogasawara population that the reversal of viability order between homozygotes took place in some environments at the locus level. On the basis of these findings, it is strongly suggested that diversifying selection is operating in a southern population of D. melanogaster on some of the viability polygenes which are probably located outside the structural loci, and the excessive additive genetic variance of viability in southern populations is maintained by this type of selection.",1987,"T Takano, S Kusakabe, T Mukai, T Takano, S Kusakabe, T Mukai"
Protective effects of tea polyphenols and β-carotene against γ-radiation induced mutation and oxidative stress in Drosophila melanogaster,29118865,10.1186/s41021-017-0084-x,"Background:
      
    

    
      The commonly consumed antioxidants β-carotene and tea polyphenols were used to assess their protective effects against γ-radiation induced sex-linked recessive lethal (SLRL) mutation and oxidative stress in Drosophila melanogaster. Third instar larvae and adult males of wild-type Oregon-K (ORK) were fed on test agents for 24 and 72 h respectively before exposure to 10Gy γ-irradiation. The treated/control flies were used to assess the induction of SLRLs. We also evaluated antioxidant properties of these phytochemicals in the third instar larvae.

The generation of chromosomal deletions to provide extensive coverage and subdivision of the Drosophila melanogaster genome,22445104,10.1186/gb-2012-13-3-r21,"Background:
      
    

    
      Chromosomal deletions are used extensively in Drosophila melanogaster genetics research. Deletion mapping is the primary method used for fine-scale gene localization. Effective and efficient deletion mapping requires both extensive genomic coverage and a high density of molecularly defined breakpoints across the genome.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      A large-scale resource development project at the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center has improved the choice of deletions beyond that provided by previous projects. FLP-mediated recombination between FRT-bearing transposon insertions was used to generate deletions, because it is efficient and provides single-nucleotide resolution in planning deletion screens. The 793 deletions generated pushed coverage of the euchromatic genome to 98.4%. Gaps in coverage contain haplolethal and haplosterile genes, but the sizes of these gaps were minimized by flanking these genes as closely as possible with deletions. In improving coverage, a complete inventory of haplolethal and haplosterile genes was generated and extensive information on other haploinsufficient genes was compiled. To aid mapping experiments, a subset of deletions was organized into a Deficiency Kit to provide maximal coverage efficiently. To improve the resolution of deletion mapping, screens were planned to distribute deletion breakpoints evenly across the genome. The median chromosomal interval between breakpoints now contains only nine genes and 377 intervals contain only single genes.

Analysis of two promoters that control the expression of the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene in Drosophila melanogaster,19387565,10.1007/s10059-009-0072-5,"GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) is a key enzyme in the de novo synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin. Previously, the Drosophila melanogaster GTPCH gene has been shown to be expressed from two different promoters (P1 and P2). In our study, the 5'-flanking DNA regions required for P1 and P2 promoter activities were characterized using transient expression assay. The DNA regions between -98 and +31, and between -73 and +35 are required for efficient P1 and P2 promoter activities, respectively. The regions between -98 and -56 and between -73 and -41 may contain critical elements required for the expression of GTPCH in Drosophila. By aligning the nucleotide sequences in the P1 and P2 promoter regions of the Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis GTPCH genes, several conserved elements including palindromic sequences in the regions critical for P1 and P2 promoter activities were identified. Western blot analysis of transgenic flies transformed using P1 or P2 promoter-lacZ fusion plasmids further revealed that P1 promoter expression is restricted to the late pupae and adult developmental stages but that the P2 promoter driven expression of GTPCH is constitutive throughout fly development. In addition, X-gal staining of the embryos and imaginal discs of transgenic flies suggests that the P2 promoter is active from stage 13 of embryo and is generally active in most regions of the imaginal discs at the larval stages.",2009,"Jaegoo Byun, Jaeseung Yoon, Kwanghee Baek, Jaegoo Byun, Jaeseung Yoon, Kwanghee Baek"

While the mechanism of ALK activation in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been examined, to date, no in vivo role for this orphan insulin receptor family RTK has been described.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We describe here a novel Drosophila melanogaster RTK, DAlk, which we have mapped to band 53 on the right arm of the second chromosome. Full-length DAlk cDNA encodes a phosphoprotein of 200 kDa, which shares homology not only with mammalian ALK but also with the orphan RTK LTK. Analysis of both mammalian and Drosophila ALK reveals that the ALK family of RTKs contains a newly identified MAM domain within their extracellular domains. Like its mammalian counterpart, DAlk appears to be expressed in the developing CNS by in situ analysis. However, in addition to expression of DAlk in the Drosophila brain, careful analysis reveals an additional early role for DAlk in the developing visceral mesoderm where its expression is coincident with activated ERK.

      In this paper we describe a Drosophila melanogaster Alk RTK which is expressed in the developing embryonic mesoderm and CNS. Our data provide evidence for the existence of a DAlk RTK pathway in Drosophila. We show that ERK participates in this pathway, and that it is activated by DAlk in vivo.

MEK inhibitor cobimetinib rescues a dRaf mutant lethal phenotype in Drosophila melanogaster,31338879,10.1111/exd.14010,"Since Drosophila melanogaster has proven to be a useful model system to study phenotypes of oncogenic mutations and to identify new anti-cancer drugs, we generated human BRAFV600E homologous dRaf mutant (dRafA572E ) Drosophila melanogaster strains to use these for characterisation of mutant phenotypes and exploit these phenotypes for drug testing. For mutant gene expression, the GAL4/UAS expression system was used. dRafA572E was expressed tissue-specific in the eye, epidermis, heart, wings, secretory glands and in the whole animal. Expression of dRaf A572E under the control of an eye-specific driver led to semi-lethality and a rough eye phenotype. The vast majority of other tissue-specific and ubiquitous drivers led to a lethal phenotype only. The rough eye phenotype was used to test BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and MEK1/2 inhibitor cobimetinib. There was no phenotype rescue by this treatment. However, a significant rescue of the lethal phenotype was observed under a gut-specific driver. Here, MEK1/2 inhibitor cobimetinib rescued Drosophila larvae to reach pupal stage in 37% of cases as compared to 1% in control experiments.

Genetic basis of natural variation in body pigmentation in Drosophila melanogaster,26554300,10.1080/19336934.2015.1102807,"Body pigmentation in insects and other organisms is typically variable within and between species and is often associated with fitness. Regulatory variants with large effects at bab1, t and e affect variation in abdominal pigmentation in several populations of Drosophila melanogaster.

We confirmed the large effects of regulatory variants in bab1, t and e; identified 81 additional candidate genes; and validated 17 candidate genes (out of 28 tested) using RNAi knockdown of gene expression and mutant alleles. However, these analyses are imperfect proxies for the effects of segregating variants.

Environmental cue affects the hearing-related behaviors of Drosophila melanogaster by targeting the redox pathways,32524398,10.1007/s11356-020-09141-0,"Environmental cues like noise, pressure, and circadian rhythm can affect the hearing ability of human beings. Nevertheless, the complex physiology of the human being does not allow us to understand how these factors can affect hearing and hearing-related behaviors. Conversely, these effects can be easily checked using the hearing organ of Drosophila melanogaster, the Johnston organ. In the current study, the Drosophila was exposed to challenging environments like noise, low pressure, and altered circadian rhythm. The hearing organ of larvae, as well as adults, was analyzed for hearing-related defects. In the third instar larva, the cell deaths were detected in the antenna imaginal disc, the precursor of Johnston's organ. Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant enzymes were also detected in the adult antennae of environmentally challenged flies. The ultrastructure of the antennae suggests the presence of abundant mitochondria in the scolopidia of control. Fewer amounts of mitochondria are found in the environmentally challenged adult antennae. In adults, various hearing-related behaviors were analyzed as a readout of functionality of the hearing organ. Analysis of climbing, aggressive, and courtship behaviors suggests abnormal behavior in environmentally challenged flies than the control. The current study suggests that the environmental cues can alter hearing-related behaviors in Drosophila. The methods used in this study can be used to monitor the environmental pollution or to study the effect of alteration of noise, pressure, and circadian rhythm on hearing-related behaviors taking Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism.

Vibrio parahaemolyticus VopA Is a Potent Inhibitor of Cell Migration and Apoptosis in the Intestinal Epithelium of Drosophila melanogaster,30617204,10.1128/IAI.00669-18,"Animal models have played a key role in providing an understanding of the mechanisms that govern the pathophysiology of intestinal diseases. To expand on the repertoire of organisms available to study enteric diseases, we report on the use of the Drosophila melanogaster model to identify a novel function of an effector protein secreted by Vibrio parahaemolyticus, which is an enteric pathogen found in contaminated seafood. During pathogenesis, V. parahaemolyticus secretes effector proteins that usurp the host's innate immune signaling pathways, thus allowing the bacterium to evade detection by the innate immune system. One secreted effector protein, VopA, has potent inhibitory effects on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways via the acetylation of critical residues within the catalytic loops of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs). Using the Drosophila model and cultured mammalian cells, we show that VopA also has potent modulating activity on focal adhesion complex (FAC) proteins, where VopA markedly reduced the levels of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation at Ser910, whereas the phosphorylation levels of FAK at Tyr397 and Tyr861 were markedly increased. Cultured cells expressing VopA were also impaired in their ability to migrate and repopulate areas subjected to a scratch wound. Consistently, expression of VopA in Drosophila midgut enterocytes disrupted the normal enterocyte arrangement. Finally, VopA inhibited apoptosis in both Drosophila tissues and mammalian cultured cells. Together, our data show that VopA can alter normal intestinal homeostatic processes to facilitate opportunities for V. parahaemolyticus to prolong infection within the host.",2019,"Liping Luo, Jason D Matthews, Brian S Robinson, Rheinallt M Jones, Liping Luo, Jason D Matthews, Brian S Robinson, Rheinallt M Jones"
Frequent replenishment sustains the beneficial microbiome of Drosophila melanogaster,24194543,10.1128/mBio.00860-13,"We report that establishment and maintenance of the Drosophila melanogaster microbiome depend on ingestion of bacteria. Frequent transfer of flies to sterile food prevented establishment of the microbiome in newly emerged flies and reduced the predominant members, Acetobacter and Lactobacillus spp., by 10- to 1,000-fold in older flies. Flies with a normal microbiome were less susceptible than germfree flies to infection by Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Augmentation of the normal microbiome with higher populations of Lactobacillus plantarum, a Drosophila commensal and probiotic used in humans, further protected the fly from infection. Replenishment represents an unexplored strategy by which animals can sustain a gut microbial community. Moreover, the population behavior and health benefits of L. plantarum resemble features of certain probiotic bacteria administered to humans. As such, L. plantarum in the fly gut may serve as a simple model for dissecting the population dynamics and mode of action of probiotics in animal hosts.
    

    
  


        Importance:
      
    

    
      Previous studies have defined the composition of the Drosophila melanogaster microbiome in laboratory and wild-caught flies. Our study advances current knowledge in this field by demonstrating that Drosophila must consume bacteria to establish and maintain its microbiome. This finding suggests that the dominant Drosophila symbionts remain associated with their host because of repeated reintroduction rather than internal growth. Furthermore, our study shows that one member of the microbiome, Lactobacillus plantarum, protects the fly from intestinal pathogens. These results suggest that, although not always present, the microbiota can promote salubrious effects for the host. In sum, our work provides a previously unexplored mechanism of microbiome maintenance and an in vivo model system for investigating the mechanisms of action of probiotic bacteria.",2013,"Jessamina E Blum, Caleb N Fischer, Jessica Miles, Jo Handelsman, Jessamina E Blum, Caleb N Fischer, Jessica Miles, Jo Handelsman"
Anti-aging Effect of Agar Oligosaccharide on Male Drosophila melanogaster and its Preliminary Mechanism,31698828,10.3390/md17110632,"Agar oligosaccharide (AOS) is a marine prebiotic with apparent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-tumor effects. During this study, different doses of AOS are added to a basal diet to evaluate its effects on the lifespan, motor vigor and reproduction of male Drosophila melanogaster. Additionally, the activities of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) and catalase (CAT) and the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in male Drosophila are examined on the 10th, 25th and 40th days. The fly midguts are removed on the 10th and 40th days for analyses of the intestinal microbial community by 16S rDNA sequencing and the expression level of intestinal immunity genes by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). The results show that AOS significantly prolonged the average and maximum lifespan and increased the antioxidant capacity of male Drosophila. Additionally, AOS significantly regulated the structure of the intestinal flora of ""old"" flies (40 days) and upregulated the expression of immune deficiency (IMD) genes to improve the intestinal immunity, which could be beneficial for delaying aging in old flies. The above-described results provide a theoretical basis for the application of AOS, a type of marine oligosaccharide, as a nutritional supplement or immunomodulator.",2019,"Chao Ma, Kun Yang, Yifan Wang, Xianjun Dai, Chao Ma, Kun Yang, Yifan Wang, Xianjun Dai"
Behavioral and Electrophysiologic Responses of Drosophila melanogaster to Prolonged Periods of Anoxia,12769903,10.1016/s0022-1910(96)00084-4,"Sensitivity to anoxia varies tremendously among phyla and species. Most mammals are exquisitely sensitive to low concentrations of inspired oxygen, while some fish, turtles and crustacea are very resistant. To determine the basis of anoxia tolerance, it would be useful to utilize a model system which can yield mechanistic answers. We studied the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to determine its anoxia resistance since this organism has been previously studied using a variety of approaches and has proven to be very useful in a number of areas of biology. Flies were exposed to anoxia for periods of 5-240 min, and, after 1-2 min in anoxia, Drosophila lost coordination, fell down, and became motionless. However, they tolerated a complete nitrogen atmosphere for up to 4 h following which they recovered. In addition, a nonlinear relation existed between time spent in anoxia and time to recovery. Extracellular recordings from flight muscles in response to giant fiber stimulation revealed complete recovery of muscle-evoked response, a response that was totally absent during anoxia. Mean O(2) consumption per gram of tissue was substantially reduced in low O(2) concentrations (20% of control). We conclude from these studies that: (1) Drosophila melanogaster is very resistant to anoxia and can be useful in the study of mechanisms of anoxia tolerance; and (2) the profound decline in metabolic rate during periods of low environmental O(2) levels contributes to the survival of Drosophila.

Metabolomic Analysis Reveals That the Drosophila melanogaster Gene lysine Influences Diverse Aspects of Metabolism,28986444,10.1534/genetics.117.300201,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a powerful model for investigating the molecular mechanisms that regulate animal metabolism. However, a major limitation of these studies is that many metabolic assays are tedious, dedicated to analyzing a single molecule, and rely on indirect measurements. As a result, Drosophila geneticists commonly use candidate gene approaches, which, while important, bias studies toward known metabolic regulators. In an effort to expand the scope of Drosophila metabolic studies, we used the classic mutant lysine (lys) to demonstrate how a modern metabolomics approach can be used to conduct forward genetic studies. Using an inexpensive and well-established gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based method, we genetically mapped and molecularly characterized lys by using free lysine levels as a phenotypic readout. Our efforts revealed that lys encodes the Drosophila homolog of Lysine Ketoglutarate Reductase/Saccharopine Dehydrogenase, which is required for the enzymatic degradation of lysine. Furthermore, this approach also allowed us to simultaneously survey a large swathe of intermediate metabolism, thus demonstrating that Drosophila lysine catabolism is complex and capable of influencing seemingly unrelated metabolic pathways. Overall, our study highlights how a combination of Drosophila forward genetics and metabolomics can be used for unbiased studies of animal metabolism, and demonstrates that a single enzymatic step is intricately connected to diverse aspects of metabolism.",2017,"Samantha L St Clair, Hongde Li, Usman Ashraf, Jonathan A Karty, Jason M Tennessen, Samantha L St Clair, Hongde Li, Usman Ashraf, Jonathan A Karty, Jason M Tennessen"
Tissue-specific expression phenotypes of Hawaiian Drosophila Adh genes in Drosophila melanogaster transformants,2165967,,"Interspecific differences in the tissue-specific patterns of expression displayed by the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) genes within the Hawaiian picture-winged Drosophila represent a rich source of evolutionary variation in gene regulation. Study of the cis-acting elements responsible for regulatory differences between Adh genes from various species is greatly facilitated by analyzing the behavior of the different Adh genes in a homogeneous background. Accordingly, the Adh gene from Drosophila grimshawi was introduced into the germ line of Drosophila melanogaster by means of P element-mediated transformation, and transformants carrying this gene were compared to transformants carrying the Adh genes from Drosophila affinidisjuncta and Drosophila hawaiiensis. The results indicate that the D. affinidisjuncta and D. grimshawi genes have relatively higher levels of expression and broader tissue distribution of expression than the D. hawaiiensis gene in larvae. All three genes are expressed at similar overall levels in adults, with differences in tissue distribution of enzyme activity corresponding to the pattern in the donor species. However, certain systematic differences between Adh gene expression in transformants and in the Hawaiian Drosophila are noted along with tissue-specific position effects in some cases. The implications of these findings for the understanding of evolved regulatory variation are discussed.",1990,"C Y Wu, J Mote Jr, M D Brennan, C Y Wu, J Mote Jr, M D Brennan"

Patterns and processes of genome-wide divergence between North American and African Drosophila melanogaster,20551441,10.1534/genetics.110.117366,"Genomic tools and analyses are now being widely used to understand genome-wide patterns and processes associated with speciation and adaptation. In this article, we apply a genomics approach to the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. This species originated in Africa and subsequently spread and adapted to temperate environments of Eurasia and the New World, leading some populations to evolve reproductive isolation, especially between cosmopolitan and Zimbabwean populations. We used tiling arrays to identify highly differentiated regions within and between North America (the United States and Caribbean) and Africa (Cameroon and Zimbabwe) across 63% of the D. melanogaster genome and then sequenced representative fragments to study their genetic divergence. Consistent with previous findings, our results showed that most differentiation was between populations living in Africa vs. outside of Africa (i.e., ""out-of-Africa"" divergence), with all other geographic differences being less substantial (e.g., between cosmopolitan and Zimbabwean races). The X chromosome was much more strongly differentiated than the autosomes between North American and African populations (i.e., greater X divergence). Overall differentiation was positively associated with recombination rates across chromosomes, with a sharp reduction in regions near centromeres. Fragments surrounding these high F(ST) sites showed reduced haplotype diversity and increased frequency of rare and derived alleles in North American populations compared to African populations. Nevertheless, despite sharp deviation from neutrality in North American strains, a small set of bottleneck/expansion demographic models was consistent with patterns of variation at the majority of our high F(ST) fragments. Although North American populations were more genetically variable compared to Europe, our simulation results were generally consistent with those previously based on European samples. These findings support the hypothesis that most differentiation between North America and Africa was likely driven by the sorting of African standing genetic variation into the New World via Europe. Finally, a few exceptional loci were identified, highlighting the need to use an appropriate demographic null model to identify possible cases of selective sweeps in species with complex demographic histories.",2010,"Roman Yukilevich, Thomas L Turner, Fumio Aoki, Sergey V Nuzhdin, John R True, Roman Yukilevich, Thomas L Turner, Fumio Aoki, Sergey V Nuzhdin, John R True"
Acid-base catalysis in the mechanism of thioredoxin reductase from Drosophila melanogaster,18211101,10.1021/bi702040u,"Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) catalyzes the reduction of thioredoxin (Trx) by NADPH. Like other members of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase enzyme family, the enzyme from Drosophila melanogaster is a homodimer, and each catalytically active unit consists of three redox centers: FAD and an N-terminal Cys-57/Cys-62 redox-active disulfide from one monomer and a Cys-489'/Cys-490' C-terminal redox-active disulfide from the second monomer. Because dipteran insects such as D. melanogaster lack glutathione reductase, thioredoxin reductase (DmTrxR) is particularly important; in addition to its normal functions, it also reduces GSSG for antioxidant protection. DmTrxR, used as a model for the enzyme from the malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae, has been shown to cycle in catalysis between the two-electron and four-electron reduced states, EH2 and EH4 [Bauer, H. et al. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 33020-33028]. His-464' acts as an acid-base catalyst of the dithiol-disulfide interchange reactions required in catalysis. The H464'Q enzyme has only 2% of the wild-type activity, emphasizing the importance of this residue. The pH dependence of Vmax for wild-type DmTrxR has pKa values of 6.4 and 9.3 on the DmTrxR-DmTrx-2 complex, whereas H464'Q DmTrxR only has an observable pKa at 6.4, indicating that the pKa at pH 9.3 is contributed mainly by His-464'. The pKa at pH 6.4 has been assigned to Cys-57 and Cys-490'; the thiolate on Cys-490' is the nucleophile in the reduction of Trx. In contrast to wild-type DmTrxR, H464'Q DmTrxR does not stabilize a thiolate-FAD charge-transfer complex in the presence of excess NADPH. The rates of steps in both the reductive and the oxidative half-reactions are markedly diminished in H464'Q DmTrxR as compared to those of wild-type enzyme, indicating that His-464' is involved in both half-reactions.",2008,"Hsin-Hung Huang, L David Arscott, David P Ballou, Charles H Williams Jr, Hsin-Hung Huang, L David Arscott, David P Ballou, Charles H Williams Jr"
The Hsp60C gene in the 25F cytogenetic region in Drosophila melanogaster is essential for tracheal development and fertility,16385159,10.1007/BF02715797,"Earlier studies have shown that of the four genes (Hsp60A, Hsp60B, Hsp60C, Hsp60D genes) predicted to encode the conserved Hsp60 family chaperones in Drosophila melanogaster, the Hsp60A gene (at the 10A polytene region) is expressed in all cell types of the organism and is essential from early embryonic stages, while the Hsp60B gene (at 21D region) is expressed only in testis, being essential for sperm individualization. In the present study, we characterized the Hsp60C gene (at 25F region), which shows high sequence homology with the other three Hsp60 genes of D. melanogaster. In situ hybridization of Hsp60C-specific riboprobe shows that expression of this gene begins in late embryonic stages (stage 14 onwards), particularly in the developing tracheal system and salivary glands; during larval and adult stages, it is widely expressed in many cell types but much more strongly in tracheae and in developing and differentiating germ cells. A P-insertion mutant (Hsp60C(1)) allele with the P transposon inserted at -251 position of the Hsp60C gene promoter was generated. This early larval recessive lethal mutation significantly reduces levels of Hsp60C transcripts in developing tracheae and this is associated with a variety of defects in the tracheal system, including lack of liquid clearance. About 10% of the homozygotes survive as weak, shortlived and completely sterile adults. Testes of the surviving mutant males are significantly smaller, with fewer spermatocytes, most of which do not develop beyond the round spermatid stage. In situ and Northern hybridizations show significantly reduced levels of the Hsp60C transcripts in Hsp60C(1) homozygous adult males. The absence of early meiotic stages in the Hsp60C(1) homozygous testes contrasts with the effect of testis-specific Hsp60B (21D) gene, whose mutation affects individualization of sperm bundles later in spermiogenesis. In view of the specific effects in tracheal development and in early stages of spermatogenesis, it is likely that, besides its functions as a chaperone, Hsp60C may have signalling functions and may also be involved in cation transport across the developing tracheal epithelial cells.",2005,"Surajit Sarkar, Subhash C Lakhotia, Surajit Sarkar, Subhash C Lakhotia"
CRISPR/Cas9 mediated disruption of the white gene leads to pigmentation deficiency and copulation failure in Drosophila suzukii,32745561,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2020.104091,"The Spotted-wing Drosophila (Drosophila suzukii) is a devastating invasive pest of fruit crops. In D. melanogaster, the white (w) gene was associated with pigmentation and mating behavior, which are also important aspects to understand the invasion biology as well as to develop control strategies for D. suzukii. Here, we show that the generation of D. suzukii white-eyed mutants by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of the w gene resulted in the complete failure of copulation when w- males were individually paired with w- females in small circular arenas (diameter 0.7 cm) for 24 h. Further analysis showed that the mating defect was associated with w- males and could not be rectified by two years of inbreeding by crossing sibling w- females with w+ males, dim red illumination, male-female sexual training, changing to large arenas (diameter 3.5 cm), or different sex ratios. Profound pigmentation deficiency was detected in the compound eyes, ocelli, Malpighian tubules and testis sheaths in the w- flies. Specifically, testis imaging showed that w- males failed to deposit any pigments into pigment cells of the testis sheath, and produced smaller sperms and less seminal fluid compared to those from wildtype males. Together these observations suggest that the w gene plays an essential role in the regulation of sexual behavior and reproduction in D. suzukii. The similarities and differences in w gene function between D. suzukii and D. melanogaster in the context of pigmentation and mating behavior are discussed.",2020,"Ying Yan, Judith Ziemek, Marc F Schetelig, Ying Yan, Judith Ziemek, Marc F Schetelig"
Structural organization of the alpha-amylase gene locus in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila miranda,3110097,,"Chromosomal sites belonging to the alpha-amylase gene family have been identified in D. melanogaster and D. miranda and in the sibling species of miranda, pseudoobscura, and persimilis. Two sites occur in chromosome 2 of melanogaster; one contains the Amy gene locus (54A) and the other an amylase ""pseudogene"" (53CD). Two sites of homology exist at 73A and 78C and perhaps another at 81BC in chromosome 3 of pseudoobscura and persimilis and in the homologous regions of the X2 chromosome in miranda. The active Amy locus is apparently at 73A. The structural organization of cloned sequences from this multigene family in melanogaster and miranda is under analysis, with emphasis on the functional Amy gene region. Electrophoretic variants of amylase have served as invaluable tools in these studies. For melanogaster, their use as genetic markers enabled us to positively identify our lambda Dm65 clone of the Amy locus and to show that it contains two functional copies of the structural gene for alpha-amylase. Amylase isozymes are now being used in P element-mediated transformation experiments aimed at defining regulatory elements for the temporal and spatial control of amylase expression during development and in response to dietary glucose. In miranda, electrophoretic variants of amylase were useful in assigning the Amy locus to chromosome X2, and they continue to serve as essential markers in our study of the evolution of dosage compensation for amylase expression in males of this species. Restriction maps of the Amy locus in 7 strains of D. melanogaster indicate that despite the worldwide origins of the chromosome samples, all contain a duplication of the amylase structural gene at this locus regardless of whether they produce two alpha-amylase isozymes, a single variant, or none. We have aligned these maps with the genetic and cytological maps of chromosome 2R in melanogaster and assigned alleles for different amylase isozymes to either the proximal or distal Amy gene copy in a number of strains. Restriction site polymorphism is relatively limited at the Amy locus, but some strain-specific rearrangements exist. The locus of two strains with reduced amylase activity, Amy1 (CA 1) and Amy ""null"", contain anomalies--an insertion in the former and an inversion in the latter. Causal relationships are being sought between the level of amylase expression in these strains and the position of their respective anomalies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1987,"W W Doane, R M Gemmill, P E Schwartz, S A Hawley, R A Norman, W W Doane, R M Gemmill, P E Schwartz, S A Hawley, R A Norman"
Metabolism of arsenic in Drosophila melanogaster and the genotoxicity of dimethylarsinic acid in the Drosophila wing spot test,16304668,10.1002/em.20178,"Inorganic arsenic is nongenotoxic in the Drosophila melanogaster wing somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART). Recent evidence in mammalian systems indicates that methylated metabolites of arsenic are more genotoxic than inorganic arsenic. Thus, we hypothesized that inorganic arsenic is nongenotoxic in Drosophila because they are unable to biotransform arsenic to methylated forms. In the present study, we fed trivalent and pentavalent inorganic arsenic to Drosophila larvae and adults and measured the production of methylated derivatives. No biomethylated arsenic species were found in the organisms or in the growth medium, which suggests that Drosophila are unable to biomethylate inorganic arsenic. Exposure of Drosophila to the methylated arsenic derivative dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)) resulted in incorporation of this organoarsenic compound without demethylation. In addition, we used the SMART wing spot assay, which measures loss of heterozygosity (LOH) resulting from gene mutation, chromosomal rearrangement, chromosome breakage, and chromosome loss, to evaluate the genotoxicity of DMA. DMA by itself induced significant increases in the frequency of total spots, small spots, and large single spots. These results are consistent with the important role of arsenic biomethylation as a determinant of the genotoxicity of arsenic compounds. The absence of biomethylation in Drosophila could explain the lack of genotoxicity for inorganic arsenic and the genotoxicity of methylated arsenic species in the SMART wing spot assay.",2006,"Mostapha Rizki, Elk Kossatz, Antonia Velázquez, Amadeu Creus, Massimo Farina, Salvador Fortaner, Enrico Sabbioni, Ricardo Marcos, Mostapha Rizki, Elk Kossatz, Antonia Velázquez, Amadeu Creus, Massimo Farina, Salvador Fortaner, Enrico Sabbioni, Ricardo Marcos"
A systematic analysis of human disease-associated gene sequences in Drosophila melanogaster,11381037,10.1101/gr.169101,"We performed a systematic analysis of 929 human disease gene entries associated with at least one mutant allele in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database against the recently completed genome sequence of Drosophila melanogaster.

Our analysis identified 714 distinct human disease genes (77% of disease genes searched) matching 548 unique Drosophila sequences, which we have summarized by disease category. This breakdown into disease classes creates a picture of disease genes that are amenable to study using Drosophila as the model organism. Of the 548 Drosophila genes related to human disease genes, 153 are associated with known mutant alleles and 56 more are tagged by P-element insertions in or near the gene. Examples of how to use the database to identify Drosophila genes related to human disease genes are presented.

Environmentally-induced epigenetic conversion of a piRNA cluster,30875295,10.7554/eLife.39842,"Transposable element (TE) activity is repressed in animal gonads by PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) produced by piRNA clusters. Current models in flies propose that germinal piRNA clusters are functionally defined by the maternal inheritance of piRNAs produced during the previous generation. Taking advantage of an inactive, but ready to go, cluster of P-element derived transgene insertions in Drosophila melanogaster, we show here that raising flies at high temperature (29°C) instead of 25°C triggers the stable conversion of this locus from inactive into actively producing functional piRNAs. The increase of antisense transcripts from the cluster at 29°C combined with the requirement of transcription of euchromatic homologous sequences, suggests a role of double stranded RNA in the production of de novo piRNAs. This report describes the first case of the establishment of an active piRNA cluster by environmental changes in the absence of maternal inheritance of homologous piRNAs.

Relish2 mediates bursicon homodimer-induced prophylactic immunity in the mosquito Aedes aegypti,28225068,10.1038/srep43163,"Bursicon is a neuropeptide hormone consisting of two cystine-knot proteins (burs α and burs β), responsible for cuticle tanning and other developmental processes in insects. Recent studies show that each bursicon subunit forms homodimers that induce prophylactic immunity in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that bursicon homodimers act in prophylactic immunity in insects, and possibly arthropods, generally, using the mosquito, Aedes aegypti. We found that burs α and burs β are expressed in larvae, pupae and newly emerged adults. Treating newly emerged Ae. aegypti and D. melanogaster adults with recombinant bursicon (r-bursicon) heterodimer led to cuticle tanning in both species. Treating larvae and adults with r-bursicon homodimers led to up-regulation of five anti-microbial peptide (AMP) genes, noting the possibility that bursicon heterodimers also lead to up-regulation of these genes can not been excluded. The induced AMPs effectively suppressed the growth of bacteria in vitro. RNAi knock-down of the transcriptional factor Relish2 abolished the influence of r-bursicon homodimers on AMP production. We infer the bursicon homodimers induce expression of AMP genes via Relish2 in Ae. aegypti, as prophylactic immunity to protect mosquitoes during the vulnerable stages of each molt.",2017,"Hongwei Zhang, Shengzhang Dong, Xi Chen, David Stanley, Brenda Beerntsen, Qili Feng, Qisheng Song, Hongwei Zhang, Shengzhang Dong, Xi Chen, David Stanley, Brenda Beerntsen, Qili Feng, Qisheng Song"
Immediate perception of a reward is distinct from the reward's long-term salience,28005005,10.7554/eLife.22283,"Reward perception guides all aspects of animal behavior. However, the relationship between the perceived value of a reward, the latent value of a reward, and the behavioral response remains unclear. Here we report that, given a choice between two sweet and chemically similar sugars-L- and D-arabinose-Drosophila melanogaster prefers D- over L- arabinose, but forms long-term memories of L-arabinose more reliably. Behavioral assays indicate that L-arabinose-generated memories require sugar receptor Gr43a, and calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings indicate that L- and D-arabinose differentially activate Gr43a-expressing neurons. We posit that the immediate valence of a reward is not always predictive of the long-term reinforcement value of that reward, and that a subset of sugar-sensing neurons may generate distinct representations of similar sugars, allowing for rapid assessment of the salient features of various sugar rewards and generation of reward-specific behaviors. However, how sensory neurons communicate information about L-arabinose quality and concentration-features relevant for long-term memory-remains unknown.",2016,"John P McGinnis, Huoqing Jiang, Moutaz Ali Agha, Consuelo Perez Sanchez, Jeff Lange, Zulin Yu, Frederic Marion-Poll, Kausik Si, John P McGinnis, Huoqing Jiang, Moutaz Ali Agha, Consuelo Perez Sanchez, Jeff Lange, Zulin Yu, Frederic Marion-Poll, Kausik Si"
Gap Gene Regulatory Dynamics Evolve along a Genotype Network,26796549,10.1093/molbev/msw013,"Developmental gene networks implement the dynamic regulatory mechanisms that pattern and shape the organism. Over evolutionary time, the wiring of these networks changes, yet the patterning outcome is often preserved, a phenomenon known as ""system drift."" System drift is illustrated by the gap gene network-involved in segmental patterning-in dipteran insects. In the classic model organism Drosophila melanogaster and the nonmodel scuttle fly Megaselia abdita, early activation and placement of gap gene expression domains show significant quantitative differences, yet the final patterning output of the system is essentially identical in both species. In this detailed modeling analysis of system drift, we use gene circuits which are fit to quantitative gap gene expression data in M. abdita and compare them with an equivalent set of models from D. melanogaster. The results of this comparative analysis show precisely how compensatory regulatory mechanisms achieve equivalent final patterns in both species. We discuss the larger implications of the work in terms of ""genotype networks"" and the ways in which the structure of regulatory networks can influence patterns of evolutionary change (evolvability).",2016,"Anton Crombach, Karl R Wotton, Eva Jiménez-Guri, Johannes Jaeger, Anton Crombach, Karl R Wotton, Eva Jiménez-Guri, Johannes Jaeger"
Nutritional control of body size through FoxO-Ultraspiracle mediated ecdysone biosynthesis,25421296,10.7554/eLife.03091,"Despite their fundamental importance for body size regulation, the mechanisms that stop growth are poorly understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, growth ceases in response to a peak of the molting hormone ecdysone that coincides with a nutrition-dependent checkpoint, critical weight. Previous studies indicate that insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS)/Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling in the prothoracic glands (PGs) regulates ecdysone biosynthesis and critical weight. Here we elucidate a mechanism through which this occurs. We show that Forkhead Box class O (FoxO), a negative regulator of IIS/TOR, directly interacts with Ultraspiracle (Usp), part of the ecdysone receptor. While overexpressing FoxO in the PGs delays ecdysone biosynthesis and critical weight, disrupting FoxO-Usp binding reduces these delays. Further, feeding ecdysone to larvae eliminates the effects of critical weight. Thus, nutrition controls ecdysone biosynthesis partially via FoxO-Usp prior to critical weight, ensuring that growth only stops once larvae have achieved a target nutritional status.",2014,"Takashi Koyama, Marisa A Rodrigues, Alekos Athanasiadis, Alexander W Shingleton, Christen K Mirth, Takashi Koyama, Marisa A Rodrigues, Alekos Athanasiadis, Alexander W Shingleton, Christen K Mirth"
CCAT: Combinatorial Code Analysis Tool for transcriptional regulation,24366875,10.1093/nar/gkt1302,"Combinatorial interplay among transcription factors (TFs) is an important mechanism by which transcriptional regulatory specificity is achieved. However, despite the increasing number of TFs for which either binding specificities or genome-wide occupancy data are known, knowledge about cooperativity between TFs remains limited. To address this, we developed a computational framework for predicting genome-wide co-binding between TFs (CCAT, Combinatorial Code Analysis Tool), and applied it to Drosophila melanogaster to uncover cooperativity among TFs during embryo development. Using publicly available TF binding specificity data and DNaseI chromatin accessibility data, we first predicted genome-wide binding sites for 324 TFs across five stages of D. melanogaster embryo development. We then applied CCAT in each of these developmental stages, and identified from 19 to 58 pairs of TFs in each stage whose predicted binding sites are significantly co-localized. We found that nearby binding sites for pairs of TFs predicted to cooperate were enriched in regions bound in relevant ChIP experiments, and were more evolutionarily conserved than other pairs. Further, we found that TFs tend to be co-localized with other TFs in a dynamic manner across developmental stages. All generated data as well as source code for our front-to-end pipeline are available at http://cat.princeton.edu.",2014,"Peng Jiang, Mona Singh, Peng Jiang, Mona Singh"
Meta-analysis of expression of l(3)mbt tumor-associated germline genes supports the model that a soma-to-germline transition is a hallmark of human cancers,24243547,10.1002/ijc.28577,"Evidence is starting to emerge indicating that tumorigenesis in metazoans involves a soma-to-germline transition, which may contribute to the acquisition of neoplastic characteristics. Here, we have meta-analyzed gene expression profiles of the human orthologs of Drosophila melanogaster germline genes that are ectopically expressed in l(3)mbt brain tumors using gene expression datasets derived from a large cohort of human tumors. We find these germline genes, some of which drive oncogenesis in D. melanogaster, are similarly ectopically activated in a wide range of human cancers. Some of these genes normally have expression restricted to the germline, making them of particular clinical interest. Importantly, these analyses provide additional support to the emerging model that proposes a soma-to-germline transition is a general hallmark of a wide range of human tumors. This has implications for our understanding of human oncogenesis and the development of new therapeutic and biomarker targets with clinical potential.",2014,"Julia Feichtinger, Lee Larcombe, Ramsay J McFarlane, Julia Feichtinger, Lee Larcombe, Ramsay J McFarlane"
Patterning and regulatory associations of DNA methylation are mirrored by histone modifications in insects,23458712,10.1093/gbe/evt030,"Epigenetic information is an important mediator of the relationship between genotype and phenotype in eukaryotic organisms. One of the most important and widely conserved forms of epigenetic information is the methylation of genes. However, the function of intragenic DNA methylation remains poorly understood. The goal of this study was to gain greater understanding of the nature of intragenic methylation by determining its role in the multilayered epigenetic landscape of insects. We first investigated the evolutionary lability of DNA methylation by examining whether methylation patterns were conserved in the fire ant and honey bee. We found that DNA methylation was targeted to largely overlapping sets of orthologs in both species. Next, we compared intragenic DNA methylation levels in the fire ant and honey bee to comprehensive epigenetic and gene-regulatory data from Drosophila melanogaster orthologs. We observed striking evidence of a conserved association between DNA methylation in fire ants and honey bees, and several active histone modifications, constitutive gene expression, and ""broad"" promoter architecture in D. melanogaster. Overall, our study illustrates that DNA methylation is a single component of a conserved, integrated, multilayered epigenetic and regulatory landscape in insect genomes.",2013,"Brendan G Hunt, Karl M Glastad, Soojin V Yi, Michael A D Goodisman, Brendan G Hunt, Karl M Glastad, Soojin V Yi, Michael A D Goodisman"
Multinucleated smooth muscles and mononucleated as well as multinucleated striated muscles develop during establishment of the male reproductive organs of Drosophila melanogaster,22841645,10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.07.022,"The adult musculature in D. melanogaster forms during metamorphosis. Much is known about the flight and leg musculature, but not about the muscles surrounding the male reproductive tract. The inner genitalia of males consist of the testes, which emerge from the gonads; the remaining genital organs, i.e., paragonia (or accessory glands), ejaculatory duct, sperm pump, and seminal vesicles, develop out of the genital imaginal disc. We analyzed the myoblasts forming the muscle layers of these organs. In myoblasts derived from the genital imaginal disc, the regulatory region of the transcription factor DMef2 is active. DMef2 is also needed for specification and differentiation of embryonic and adult myoblasts. We could discriminate three different muscle types: (i) multinucleated muscles that resemble vertebrate smooth muscles surround the testes, (ii) multinucleated muscles that resemble striated muscles comprises seminal vesicles and the sperm pump, and (iii) mononucleated striated musculature encloses the paragonia and ejaculatory duct. Members of the immunoglobulin superfamily involved in embryonic myogenesis, Dumbfounded (Duf) and Sticks and Stones (Sns), were also expressed in the genital imaginal disc, in the muscle sheath of the testes during muscle differentiation and in the secretory secondary cells, which are part of the binucleated epithelia enclosing the paragonia.",2012,"Loreen Susic-Jung, Christina Hornbruch-Freitag, Jessica Kuckwa, Karl-Heinz Rexer, Uwe Lammel, Renate Renkawitz-Pohl, Loreen Susic-Jung, Christina Hornbruch-Freitag, Jessica Kuckwa, Karl-Heinz Rexer, Uwe Lammel, Renate Renkawitz-Pohl"
"Paraoxonase 1, quorum sensing, and P. aeruginosa infection: a novel model",20221881,10.1007/978-1-60761-350-3_17,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium which exacts a heavy burden on immunocompromised patients, but is non-pathogenic in a healthy host. Using small signaling molecules called acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), populations of P. aeruginosa can coordinate phenotypic changes, including biofilm formation and virulence factor secretion. This concentration-dependent process is called quorum sensing (QS). Interference with QS has been identified as a potential source of new treatments for P. aeruginosa infection. The human enzyme paraoxonase 1 (PON1) degrades AHL molecules, and is a promising candidate for QS interference therapy. Although paraoxonase orthologs exist in many species, genetic redundancy in humans and other mammals has made studying the specific effects of PON1 quite difficult. Arthropods, however, do not express any PON homologs. We generated a novel model to study the specific effects of PON1 by transgenically expressing human PON1 in Drosophila melanogaster. Using this model, we showed that P. aeruginosa infection lethality is QS-dependent, and that expression of PON1 has a protective effect. This work demonstrates the value of a D. melanogaster model for investigating the specific functions of members of the paraoxonase family in vivo, and suggests that PON1 plays a role in innate immunity.",2010,"M L Estin, D A Stoltz, J Zabner, M L Estin, D A Stoltz, J Zabner"
Identification of SUMO-dependent chromatin-associated transcriptional repression components by a genome-wide RNAi screen,18374648,10.1016/j.molcel.2007.12.032,"SUMO modification of many transcription factors is linked to transcriptional repression. The molecular mechanisms by which SUMO attachment represses transcription are largely unknown. Here we report a genome-wide RNA interference screen in Drosophila melanogaster cells for components regulating and mediating SUMO-dependent transcriptional repression. Analysis of >21,000 double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) identified 120 genes whose dsRNA-mediated knockdowns impaired SUMO-dependent transcriptional repression. Several of these genes encode chromatin-associated proteins, including the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Mi-2, the D. melanogaster ortholog of the C. elegans protein MEP-1, and the polycomb protein Sfmbt. Knockdown of these proteins did not impair SUMO conjugation, demonstrating that they act downstream of SUMO attachment. Biochemical analyses revealed that MEP-1, Mi-2, and Sfmbt interact with each other, bind to SUMO, and are recruited to promoters in a SUMOylation-dependent manner. Our results suggest that MEP-1, Mi-2, and Sfmbt are part of a common repression complex established by DNA-bound SUMO-modified transcription factors.",2008,"Bastian Stielow, Alexandra Sapetschnig, Imme Krüger, Natascha Kunert, Alexander Brehm, Michael Boutros, Guntram Suske, Bastian Stielow, Alexandra Sapetschnig, Imme Krüger, Natascha Kunert, Alexander Brehm, Michael Boutros, Guntram Suske"
Design and facile production of recombinant resilin-like polypeptides: gene construction and a rapid protein purification method,17218334,10.1093/protein/gzl050,"Resilin is an elastic protein found in specialized regions of the cuticle of insects, which displays unique resilience and fatigue lifetime properties. As is the case with many elastomeric proteins, including elastin, gliadin and spider silks, resilin contains distinct repetitive domains that appear to confer elastic properties to the protein. Recent work within our laboratory has demonstrated that cloning and expression of exon 1 of the Drosophila melanogaster CG15920 gene, encoding a putative resilin-like protein, results in a recombinant protein that can be photochemically crosslinked to form a highly resilient, elastic biomaterial (Rec1 resilin). The current study describes a recursive cloning strategy for generating synthetic genes encoding multiple copies of consensus polypeptides, based on the repetitive domains within resilin-like genes from D. melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae. A simple non-chromatographic purification method that can be applied to these synthetic proteins and Rec1 is also reported. These methods for the design and purification of resilin-like periodic polypeptides will facilitate the future investigation of structural and functional properties of resilin, and the development of novel highly resilient biomaterials.",2007,"Russell E Lyons, Emmanuelle Lesieur, Misook Kim, Darren C C Wong, Mickey G Huson, Kate M Nairn, Alan G Brownlee, Roger D Pearson, Christopher M Elvin, Russell E Lyons, Emmanuelle Lesieur, Misook Kim, Darren C C Wong, Mickey G Huson, Kate M Nairn, Alan G Brownlee, Roger D Pearson, Christopher M Elvin"
Selection and inbreeding depression: effects of inbreeding rate and inbreeding environment,16817541,,"The magnitude of inbreeding depression in small populations may depend on the effectiveness with which natural selection purges deleterious recessive alleles from populations during inbreeding. The effectiveness of this purging process, however, may be influenced by the rate of inbreeding and the environment in which inbreeding occurs. Although some experimental studies have examined these factors individually, no study has examined their joint effect or potential interaction. In the present study, therefore, we performed an experiment in which 180 lineages of Drosophila melanogaster were inbred at slow and fast inbreeding rates within each of three inbreeding environments (benign, high temperature, and competitive). The fitness of all lineages was then measured in a common benign environment. Although slow inbreeding reduced inbreeding depression in lineages inbred under high temperature stress, a similar reduction was not observed with respect to the benign or competitive treatments. Overall, therefore, the effect of inbreeding rate was nonsignificant. The inbreeding environment, in contrast, had a larger and more consistent effect on inbreeding depression. Under both slow and fast rates of inbreeding, inbreeding depression was significantly reduced in lineages inbred in the presence of a competitor D. melanogaster strain. A similar reduction of inbreeding depression occurred in lineages inbred under high temperature stress at a slow inbreeding rate. Overall, our findings show that inbreeding depression is reduced when inbreeding takes place in a stressful environment, possibly due to more effective purging under such conditions.",2006,"William R Swindell, Juan L Bouzat, William R Swindell, Juan L Bouzat"
Expression pattern of Bombyx vasa-like (BmVLG) protein and its implications in germ cell development,16261344,10.1007/s00427-005-0033-8,"Germ cell development in the silkworm Bombyx mori is interesting in that the species has no recognizable germ plasm, and its germ cells appear first on the ventral side of the embryo, not on the posterior pole as in Drosophila melanogaster. We previously reported the isolation of a vasa homologue (BmVLG) from B. mori and revealed the specific expression of transcript in the germ cells. In this paper, we describe the embryonic expression pattern of BmVLG protein. Consistent with the lack of recognizable germ plasm, the protein is not localized in freshly laid eggs, and its specific expression is first detectable several hours after energids penetrate the periplasm. This is in contrast to D. melanogaster, where germ cell lineage can be traced with anti-vasa antibody just after the formation of pole cells as they sequester vasa-positive germ (pole) plasm during cellularization. It is also revealed that, within the first few hours of their appearance when extensive cell movement does not seem to occur, stained cells are sometimes widely dispersed along the midline, which eventually may lead to the formation of ectopic germ cells. The implications of these results for germ cell development are discussed.",2006,"Hajime Nakao, Masatsugu Hatakeyama, Jae Min Lee, Masami Shimoda, Toshio Kanda, Hajime Nakao, Masatsugu Hatakeyama, Jae Min Lee, Masami Shimoda, Toshio Kanda"
"An active transposable element, Herves, from the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae",15545643,10.1534/genetics.104.036145,"Transposable elements have proven to be invaluable tools for genetically manipulating a wide variety of plants, animals, and microbes. Some have suggested that they could be used to spread desirable genes, such as refractoriness to Plasmodium infection, through target populations of Anopheles gambiae, thereby disabling the mosquito's ability to transmit malaria. To achieve this, a transposon must remain mobile and intact after the initial introduction into the genome. Endogenous, active class II transposable elements from An. gambiae have not been exploited as gene vectors/drivers because none have been isolated. We report the discovery of an active class II transposable element, Herves, from the mosquito An. gambiae. Herves is a member of a distinct subfamily of hAT elements that includes the hopper-we element from Bactrocera dorsalis and B. cucurbitae. Herves was transpositionally active in mobility assays performed in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells and developing embryos and was used as a germ-line transformation vector in D. melanogaster. Herves displays an altered target-site preference from the distantly related hAT elements, Hermes and hobo. Herves is also present in An. arabiensis and An. merus with copy numbers similar to that found in An. gambiae.

Evidence for a fruit fly hemangioblast and similarities between lymph-gland hematopoiesis in fruit fly and mammal aorta-gonadal-mesonephros mesoderm,15286786,10.1038/ng1404,"The Drosophila melanogaster lymph gland is a hematopoietic organ and, together with prospective vascular cells (cardioblasts) and excretory cells (pericardial nephrocytes), arises from the cardiogenic mesoderm. Clonal analysis provided evidence for a hemangioblast that can give rise to two daughter cells: one that differentiates into heart or aorta and another that differentiates into blood. In addition, the GATA factor gene pannier (pnr) and the homeobox gene tinman (tin), which are controlled by the convergence of Decapentaplegic (Dpp), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), Wingless (Wg) and Notch signaling, are required for the development of all cardiogenic mesoderm, including the lymph gland. Here we show that an essential genetic switch that differentiates between the blood or nephrocyte and vascular lineages involves the Notch pathway. Further specification occurs through specific expression of the GATA factor Serpent (Srp) in the lymph-gland primordium. Our findings suggest that there is a close parallel between the molecular mechanisms functioning in the D. melanogaster cardiogenic mesoderm and those functioning in the mammalian aorta-gonadal-mesonephros mesoderm.",2004,"Lolitika Mandal, Utpal Banerjee, Volker Hartenstein, Lolitika Mandal, Utpal Banerjee, Volker Hartenstein"
Costs of resistance in insect-parasite and insect-parasitoid interactions,12622330,10.1017/s0031182002001750,"Most, if not all, organisms face attack by natural enemies and will be selected to evolve some form of defence. Resistance may have costs as well as its obvious benefits. These costs may be associated with actual defence or with the maintenance of the defensive machinery irrespective of whether a challenge occurs. In this paper, the evidence for costs of resistance in insect-parasite and insect-parasitoid systems is reviewed, with emphasis on two host-parasitoid systems, based on Drosophila melanogaster and pea aphids as hosts. Data from true insect-parasite systems mainly concern the costs of actual defence; evidence for the costs of standing defences is mostly circumstantial. In pea aphids, the costs of standing defences have so far proved elusive. Resistance amongst clones is not correlated with life-time fecundity, whether measured on good or poor quality plants. Successful defence by a D. melanogaster larva results in a reduction in adult size and fecundity and an increased susceptibility to pupal parasitoids. Costs of standing defences are a reduction in larval competitive ability though these costs only become important when food is limited. It is concluded that costs of resistance can play a pivotal role in the evolutionary and population dynamic interactions between hosts and their parasites.",2002,"A R Kraaijeveld, J Ferrari, H C J Godfray, A R Kraaijeveld, J Ferrari, H C J Godfray"
Hidden evolution: progress and limitations in detecting multifarious natural selection,12206367,10.1023/a:1016288725718,"From illustrative examples of research on the best-studied group of species to date, Drosophila melanogaster and its closest relatives, we argue that selection is multifarious, but often hidden. Selective fixation of new, highly advantageous alleles is the most parsimonious explanation for a typical pattern of molecular variation observed in genomic regions characterized by very low recombination: drastically reduced DNA sequence variation within species and typical levels of sequence divergence among species. At the same time, the identity of the gene (or genes) influenced by selection is not just difficult to discern; it may be impossible. Studies of the genetic basis of reproductive isolation demonstrate that, although the D. melanogaster complex species appear virtually identical, dozens of currently unidentified genes contribute to hybrid sterility. We argue that these findings are best explained by selectively-driven functional divergence and demonstrate the multifarious nature of selection. Although multifarious selection certainly occurs, the exact characters responsible for differences in survival and reproductive success are unknown. We do not see these inherent limits as a cause for despair or a problem for evolutionary biology. Instead, we hope to raise awareness of these complexities of evolution by highlighting both the progress and the limitations of characterizing multifarious natural selection.",2002,"Norman A Johnson, Richard M Kliman, Norman A Johnson, Richard M Kliman"
Genes affecting aging: mapping quantitative trait loci in Drosophila melanogaster using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs),12041827,10.1023/a:1015139514332,"This study examines the use of AFLPs (amplified fragment length polymorphisms) for locating QTL for longevity. Inbred long and short-lived lines from selected stocks of D. melanogaster were backcrossed and measurements of life span compiled into a distribution. AFLP markers assorting with long life were screened from the extremes of that distribution. To test their association with further recombination, a second F1 was backcrossed for three generations and measured. Sires and progeny were genotyped for the markers initially screened. Three AFLP primer pairs identified markers assorting with long life in six of 48 sires. An a posteriori test showed that families of sires with putative markers lived significantly longer on average. A second test showed that within families, progeny with markers lived significantly longer than sibs without them. Marker positions were mapped by hybridization to a P1 genomic miniblot. AFLP markers were cloned, sequenced and matched to known genomic sequences in a BLAST search. Positions were compared to QTL known from other studies. The BLAST search indicated hybridization at multiply dispersed sites throughout the genome. Marker positions also corresponded to many from independent QTL maps.

Preblastoderm embryos of a wild-type strain of the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, were microinjected with this plasmid, together with a helper plasmid containing the Hermes transposase placed under the control of the D. melanogaster hsp70 promoter. Somatic EGFP expression was observed during early instars in approximately one-half of all G0 individuals. Two G1 individuals arising from a G0 female displayed high levels of EGFP gene expression during all stages of development. EGFP was transmitted in a Mendelian fashion to the G2 and G3 generations and molecular analysis confirmed the presence of the Hermes[actin5C:EGFP] gene in these insects.

Secondary structure model of the RNA recognized by the reverse transcriptase from the R2 retrotransposable element,8990394,,"RNA transcripts corresponding to the 250-nt 3' untranslated region of the R2 non-LTR retrotransposable element are recognized by the R2 reverse transcriptase and are sufficient to serve as templates in the target DNA-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) reaction.

A model for the RNA secondary structure of the 3' untranslated region of the D. melanogaster R2 retrotransposon was developed by sequence comparison of 10 species aided by free energy minimization. Chemical modification experiments are consistent with this prediction. A secondary structure model for the 3' untranslated region of R2 RNA from the R2 element from B. mori was obtained by a combination of chemical modification data and free energy minimization.

Most of the rare variants exhibit apparent in vivo activities that are similar to one or the other of the common variants, and these specific rare variants appear to be geographically widespread. Several variants have significantly reduced function. All of the variants were measured for larval specific activity for G6PD as a first measure of in vitro activity. It appears that specific activity alone is not a sufficient predictor for G6PD in vivo function.",1986,"W F Eanes, J Hey, W F Eanes, J Hey"
"Isolation and characterization of a new family of mobile dispersed genetic elements, mdg3, in Drosophila melanogaster",6254733,10.1007/BF00292421,"The properties of a new family of mobile dispersed genetic elements, mdg3, are described. Mdg3 is represented by a DNA fragment of about 5.5 kb long which is framed with two repetitive sequences 300-500 base pairs in length. Virtually the whole region of mdg3 including the repetitive sequences is transcribed and, as the result, 26S poly(A)+RNA is formed. The repetitive sequence is present at least at the 3'-end of a major 26S transcript. Both strands of mdg3 are transcribed, but one direction is predominant. Besides 26S RNA, a minor transcript, 15S poly(A)+RNA, can be observed. 15S RNA dose not contain sequences corresponding to the middle of mdg3. Possibly it is formed from 26S RNA by means of splicing. About 15 copies of mdg3 are present in the genome of embryonic cells and polytene chromosomes. Different copies of mdg3 are identical but surrounded with different DNA sequences. In culture cells, the gene is amplified and the number of copies is increased approximately 13 times. Mdg3 is localized in 15-17 sites on different chromosomes of D. melanogaster. Its location varies from one animal to another. The properties and possible nature of mobile dispersed genetic elements are discussed.",1980,"Y V Ilyin, V G Chmeliauskaite, E V Ananiev, G P Georgiev, Y V Ilyin, V G Chmeliauskaite, E V Ananiev, G P Georgiev"
Building a pipeline to solicit expert knowledge from the community to aid gene summary curation,31960022,10.1093/database/baz152,"Brief summaries describing the function of each gene's product(s) are of great value to the research community, especially when interpreting genome-wide studies that reveal changes to hundreds of genes. However, manually writing such summaries, even for a single species, is a daunting task; for example, the Drosophila melanogaster genome contains almost 14 000 protein-coding genes. One solution is to use computational methods to generate summaries, but this often fails to capture the key functions or express them eloquently. Here, we describe how we solicited help from the research community to generate manually written summaries of D. melanogaster gene function. Based on the data within the FlyBase database, we developed a computational pipeline to identify researchers who have worked extensively on each gene. We e-mailed these researchers to ask them to draft a brief summary of the main function(s) of the gene's product, which we edited for consistency to produce a 'gene snapshot'. This approach yielded 1800 gene snapshot submissions within a 3-month period. We discuss the general utility of this strategy for other databases that capture data from the research literature.

Dimorphic sperm formation by Sex-lethal,31036645,10.1073/pnas.1820101116,"Sex is determined by diverse mechanisms and master sex-determination genes are highly divergent, even among closely related species. Therefore, it is possible that homologs of master sex-determination genes might have alternative functions in different species. Herein, we focused on Sex-lethal (Sxl), which is the master sex-determination gene in Drosophila melanogaster and is necessary for female germline development. It has been widely shown that the sex-determination function of Sxl in Drosophilidae species is not conserved in other insects of different orders. We investigated the function of Sxl in the lepidopteran insect Bombyx mori In lepidopteran insects (moths and butterflies), spermatogenesis results in two different types of sperm: nucleated fertile eupyrene sperm and anucleate nonfertile parasperm, also known as apyrene sperm. Genetic analyses using Sxl mutants revealed that the gene is indispensable for proper morphogenesis of apyrene sperm. Similarly, our analyses using Sxl mutants clearly demonstrate that apyrene sperm are necessary for eupyrene sperm migration from the bursa copulatrix to the spermatheca. Therefore, apyrene sperm is necessary for successful fertilization of eupyrene sperm in B. mori Although Sxl is essential for oogenesis in D. melanogaster, it also plays important roles in spermatogenesis in B. mori Therefore, the ancestral function of Sxl might be related to germline development.",2019,"Hiroki Sakai, Hiroyuki Oshima, Kodai Yuri, Hiroki Gotoh, Takaaki Daimon, Toshinobu Yaginuma, Ken Sahara, Teruyuki Niimi, Hiroki Sakai, Hiroyuki Oshima, Kodai Yuri, Hiroki Gotoh, Takaaki Daimon, Toshinobu Yaginuma, Ken Sahara, Teruyuki Niimi"
Deep sequencing of the prothoracic gland transcriptome reveals new players in insect ecdysteroidogenesis,28257485,10.1371/journal.pone.0172951,"Ecdysteroids are steroid hormones that induce molting and determine developmental timing in arthropods. In insect larva, the prothoracic gland (PG) is a major organ for ecdysone synthesis and release. Released ecdysone is converted into the active form, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) in the peripheral tissues. All processes from ecdysone synthesis and release from the PG to its conversion to 20E are called ecdysteroidogenesis and are under the regulation of numerous factors expressed in the PG and peripheral tissues. Classical genetic approaches and recent transcriptomic screening in the PG identified several genes responsible for ecdysone synthesis and release, whereas the regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown. We analyzed RNA-seq data of the silkworm Bombyx mori PG and employed the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster GAL4/UAS binary RNAi system to comprehensively screen for genes involved in ecdysone synthesis and/or release. We found that the genes encoding δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase (CG3017/alas) and putative NAD kinase (CG33156) were highly expressed in the PG of both B. mori and D. melanogaster. Neither alas nor CG33156 RNAi-induced larvae could enter into the pupal stage, and they had a lower abundance of the active form ecdysteroids in their prolonged larval stage.

Serotonin modulates insect hemocyte phagocytosis via two different serotonin receptors,26974346,10.7554/eLife.12241,"Serotonin (5-HT) modulates both neural and immune responses in vertebrates, but its role in insect immunity remains uncertain. We report that hemocytes in the caterpillar, Pieris rapae are able to synthesize 5-HT following activation by lipopolysaccharide. The inhibition of a serotonin-generating enzyme with either pharmacological blockade or RNAi knock-down impaired hemocyte phagocytosis. Biochemical and functional experiments showed that naive hemocytes primarily express 5-HT1B and 5-HT2B receptors. The blockade of 5-HT1B significantly reduced phagocytic ability; however, the blockade of 5-HT2B increased hemocyte phagocytosis. The 5-HT1B-null Drosophila melanogaster mutants showed higher mortality than controls when infected with bacteria, due to their decreased phagocytotic ability. Flies expressing 5-HT1B or 5-HT2B RNAi in hemocytes also showed similar sensitivity to infection. Combined, these data demonstrate that 5-HT mediates hemocyte phagocytosis through 5-HT1B and 5-HT2B receptors and serotonergic signaling performs critical modulatory functions in immune systems of animals separated by 500 million years of evolution.",2016,"Yi-Xiang Qi, Jia Huang, Meng-Qi Li, Ya-Su Wu, Ren-Ying Xia, Gong-Yin Ye, Yi-Xiang Qi, Jia Huang, Meng-Qi Li, Ya-Su Wu, Ren-Ying Xia, Gong-Yin Ye"
Male-specific phosphorylated SR proteins in adult flies of the Mediterranean fruitfly Ceratitis capitata,25472723,10.1186/1471-2156-15-S2-S6,"Alternative splicing is a widely used mechanism of gene regulation in sex determination pathways of Insects.

Less understood is to what extent post-translational modifications of splicing regulators plays a role in this pathway. In Drosophila melanogaster phosphorylation of TRA, TRA-2 and the general RBP1 factor by the LAMMER kinase doa (darkener of apricot) is required for proper female sex determination. To explore whether this is a general feature of the pathway we examined sex-specific differences in phosphorylation levels of SR splicing factors in the dipteran species D. melanogaster, Ceratitis capitata (Medfly) and Musca domestica (Housefly).

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that mof is highly conserved in eukaryotes but lost in birds. qPCR showed that Tcmof was most highly expressed in the early embryo stage and equally expressed in males and females. Treating larvae with ds-Tcmof led 79.1% of the insects to arrest during its eclosion; the remaining insects died either in the larval stage or immediately following eclosion. Treating pupae with the same construct eliminated the fertility of T. castaneum. This effect was rescued by reciprocal crosses with wild-type females, but not males.

Exposure to sperm competition risk improves survival of virgin males,23445944,10.1098/rsbl.2012.1188,"Sperm competition between the ejaculates of multiple males for the fertilization of a given set of ova is taxonomically widespread. Males have evolved remarkable adaptations to increase their reproductive success under postcopulatory sexual selection, which in many species includes the ability to modify behaviour and ejaculate characteristics plastically to match the perceived level of sperm competition. Males of the model species Drosophila melanogaster increase mating duration and modify seminal fluid composition in response to short-term changes in sperm competition risk. If these responses increase a male's total investment in reproduction, he must either trade-off this cost against other life-history traits or suffer reduced survival. We tested whether mounting a plastic sperm competition response bears an instantaneous survival cost, and instead found that male D. melanogaster exposed to a high risk of sperm competition survive 12 per cent longer than those at low risk, equating to a 49 per cent reduction in the hourly hazard of death. This striking effect was found only among virgins: the high cost of mating in this species eliminates any such benefit among non-virgin males. Our results suggest that the improvement in survival found among virgins may be a product of males' tactical responses to sperm competition.",2013,"Joshua P Moatt, Calvin Dytham, Michael D F Thom, Joshua P Moatt, Calvin Dytham, Michael D F Thom"

Knockdown of sema1a during A. aegypti development results in a number of nerve cord phenotypes, including thinning, breakage, and occasional fusion of the longitudinal connectives, thin or absent commissures, and general distortion of the nerve cord. Although analysis of Drosophila melanogaster sema1a loss-of-function mutants uncovered many similar phenotypes, aspects of the longitudinal phenotypes differed between D. melanogaster and A. aegypti.

Cutting the nonsense: the degradation of PTC-containing mRNAs,21118136,10.1042/BST0381615,"In eukaryotes, mRNAs harbouring PTCs (premature translation-termination codons) are recognized and eliminated by NMD (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay). In addition to its quality-control function, NMD constitutes a translation-dependent post-transcriptional pathway to regulate the expression levels of physiological mRNAs. In contrast with PTC recognition, little is known about the mechanisms that trigger the rapid degradation of mammalian nonsense mRNA. Studies have shown that mammalian NMD targets can be degraded via both an SMG6 (where SMG is suppressor of morphological defects on genitalia)-dependent endonucleolytic pathway and a deadenylation and decapping-dependent exonucleolytic pathway, with the possible involvement of SMG5 and SMG7. In contrast, Drosophila melanogaster NMD is confined to the former and Saccharomyces cerevisiae NMD to the latter decay pathway. Consistent with this conclusion, mammals possess both SMG6 and SMG7, whereas D. melanogaster lacks an SMG7 homologue and yeast have no SMG6 equivalent. In the present paper, we review what is known about the degradation of PTC-containing mRNAs so far, paying particular attention to the properties of the NMD-specific factors SMG5-SMG7 and to what is known about the mechanism of degrading mRNAs after they have been committed to the NMD pathway.",2010,"Pamela Nicholson, Oliver Mühlemann, Pamela Nicholson, Oliver Mühlemann"
Estimating selection intensity on synonymous codon usage in a nonequilibrium population,19620398,10.1534/genetics.109.101782,"Codon usage bias is the nonrandom use of synonymous codons for the same amino acid. Most population genetic models of codon usage evolution assume that the population is at mutation-selection-drift equilibrium. Natural populations, however, frequently deviate from equilibrium, often because of recent demographic changes. Here, we construct a matrix model that includes the effects of a recent change in population size on estimates of selection on preferred vs. unpreferred codons. Our results suggest that patterns of synonymous polymorphisms affecting codon usage can be quite erratic after such a change; statistical methods that fail to take demographic effects into account can then give incorrect estimates of important parameters. We propose a new method that can accurately estimate both demographic and codon usage parameters. The method also provides a simple way of testing for the effects of covariates such as gene length and level of gene expression on the intensity of selection, which we apply to a large Drosophila melanogaster polymorphism data set. Our analyses of twofold degenerate codons reveal that (i) selection acts in favor of preferred codons, (ii) there is mutational bias in favor of unpreferred codons, (iii) shorter genes and genes with higher expression levels are under stronger selection, and (iv) there is little evidence for a recent change in population size in the Zimbabwe population of D. melanogaster.",2009,"Kai Zeng, Brian Charlesworth, Kai Zeng, Brian Charlesworth"

Rapid effects of acute anoxia on spindle kinetochore interactions activate the mitotic spindle checkpoint,17652159,10.1242/jcs.007690,"The dramatic chromosome instability in certain tumors might reflect a synergy of spindle checkpoint defects with hypoxic conditions. In Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, spindle checkpoint activation has been implicated in the response to acute anoxia. The activation mechanism is unknown. Our analyses in D. melanogaster demonstrate that oxygen deprivation affects microtubule organization within minutes. The rapid effects of anoxia are identical in wild-type and spindle checkpoint-deficient Mps1 mutant embryos. Therefore, the anoxia effects on the mitotic spindle are not a secondary consequence of spindle checkpoint activation. Some motor, centrosome and kinetochore proteins (dynein, Kin-8, Cnn, TACC, Cenp-C, Nuf2) are rapidly relocalized after oxygen deprivation. Kinetochores congress inefficiently into the metaphase plate and do not experience normal pulling forces. Spindle checkpoint proteins accumulate mainly within the spindle midzone and inhibit anaphase onset. In checkpoint-deficient embryos, mitosis is still completed after oxygen deprivation, although accompanied by massive chromosome missegregation. Inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation mimic anoxia effects. We conclude that oxygen deprivation impairs the chromosome segregation machinery more rapidly than spindle checkpoint function. Although involving adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-consuming kinases, the spindle checkpoint can therefore be activated by spindle damage in response to acute anoxia and protect against aneuploidies.",2007,"Rahul Pandey, Sebastian Heeger, Christian F Lehner, Rahul Pandey, Sebastian Heeger, Christian F Lehner"
The use of a non-LTR element to date the formation of the Sdic gene cluster,17351817,10.1007/s10709-007-9141-x,"Transposable elements comprise a considerable part of eukaryotic genomes, and there is increasing evidence for their role in the evolution of genomes. The number of active transposable elements present in the host genome at any given time is probably small relative to the number of elements that no longer transpose. The elements that have lost the ability to transpose tend to evolve neutrally. For example, non-LTR retrotransposons often become 5' truncated due to their own transposition mechanism and hence lose their ability to transpose. The resulting transposons can be characterized as ""dead-on-arrival"" (DOA) elements. Because they are abundant and ubiquitous, and evolve neutrally in the location where they were inserted, these DOA non-LTR elements make a useful tool to date molecular events. There are four copies of a ""dead-on-arrival"" RT1C element on the recently formed Sdic gene cluster of Drosophila melanogaster, that are not present in the equivalent region of the other species of the melanogaster subgroup. The life history of the RT1C elements in the genome of D. melanogaster was used to determine the insertion chronology of the elements in the cluster and to date the duplication events that originated this cluster.",2007,"Rita Ponce, Rita Ponce"
Secreted Bacterial Effectors and Host-Produced Eiger/TNF Drive Death in aSalmonella-Infected Fruit Fly,15562316,10.1371/journal.pbio.0020418,"Death by infection is often as much due to the host's reaction as it is to the direct result of microbial action. Here we identify genes in both the host and microbe that are involved in the pathogenesis of infection and disease in Drosophila melanogaster challenged with Salmonella enterica serovartyphimurium (S. typhimurium). We demonstrate that wild-typeS. typhimurium causes a lethal systemic infection when injected into the hemocoel of D. melanogaster. Deletion of the gene encoding the secreted bacterial effect or Salmonella leucine-rich (PslrP)changes an acute and lethal infection to one that is persistent and less deadly. We propose a model in which Salmonella secreted effectors stimulate the fly and thus cause an immune response that is damaging both to the bacteria and, subsequently, to the host. In support of this model, we show that mutations in the fly gene eiger, a TNF homolog, delay the lethality of Salmonella infection. These results suggest that S. typhimurium-infected flies die from a condition that resembles TNF-induced metabolic collapse in vertebrates. This idea provides us with a new model to study shock-like biology in a genetically manipulable host.

Systematic generation of high-resolution deletion coverage of the Drosophila melanogaster genome,14981519,10.1038/ng1312,"In fruit fly research, chromosomal deletions are indispensable tools for mapping mutations, characterizing alleles and identifying interacting loci.

Most of the existing deletions are large, have molecularly undefined endpoints and are maintained in genetically complex stocks. Furthermore, the existence of haplolethal or haplosterile loci makes the recovery of deletions of certain regions exceedingly difficult by traditional methods, resulting in gaps in coverage. Here we describe two methods that address these problems by providing for the systematic isolation of targeted deletions in the D. melanogaster genome. The first strategy used a P element-based technique to generate deletions that closely flank haploinsufficient genes and minimize undeleted regions. This deletion set has increased overall genomic coverage by 5-7%.

Heterogeneity in rates of recombination across the mouse genome,8852851,,"If loci are randomly distributed on a physical map, the density of markers on a genetic map will be inversely proportional to recombination rate. First, proposed by Mary Lyon, we have used this idea to estimate recombination rates from the Drosophila melanogaster linkage map. These results were compared with results of two other studies that estimated regional recombination rates in D. melanogaster using both physical and genetic maps. The three methods were largely concordant in identifying large-scale genomic patterns of recombination. The marker density method was then applied to the Mus musculus microsatellite linkage map. The distribution of microsatellites provided evidence for heterogeneity in recombination rates. Centromeric regions for several mouse chromosomes had significantly greater numbers of markers than expected, suggesting that recombination rates were lower in these regions. In contrast, most telomeric regions contained significantly fewer markers than expected. This indicates that recombination rates are elevated at the telomeres of many mouse chromosomes and is consistent with a comparison of the genetic and cytogenetic maps in these regions. The density of markers on a genetic map may provide a generally useful way to estimate regional recombination rates in species for which genetic, but not physical, maps are available.",1996,"M W Nachman, G A Churchill, M W Nachman, G A Churchill"
The effects of spontaneous mutation on quantitative traits. I. Variances and covariances of life history traits,7851773,,"We have accumulated spontaneous mutations in the absence of natural selection in Drosophila melanogaster by backcrossing 200 heterozygous replicates of a single high fitness second chromosome to a balancer stock for 44 generations. At generations 33 and 44 of accumulation, we extracted samples of chromosomes and assayed their homozygous performance for female fecundity early and late in adult life, male and female longevity, male mating ability early and late in adult life, productivity (a measure of fecundity times viability) and body weight. The variance among lines increased significantly for all traits except male mating ability and weight. The rate of increase in variance was similar to that found in previous studies of egg-to-adult viability, when calculated relative to trait means. The mutational correlations among traits were all strongly positive. Many correlations were significantly different from 0, while none was significantly different from 1. These data suggest that the mutation-accumulation hypothesis is not a sufficient explanation for the evolution of senescence in D. melanogaster. Mutation-selection balance does seem adequate to explain a substantial proportion of the additive genetic variance for fecundity and longevity.",1994,"D Houle, K A Hughes, D K Hoffmaster, J Ihara, S Assimacopoulos, D Canada, B Charlesworth, D Houle, K A Hughes, D K Hoffmaster, J Ihara, S Assimacopoulos, D Canada, B Charlesworth"
The Segregation Distorter (SD) complex and the accumulation of deleterious genes in laboratory strains of Drosophila melanogaster,24190321,10.1007/BF00215094,"Segregation Distorter (SD) associated with the second chromosome of D. melanogaster is found in nature at equilibrium frequencies lower than 5%. We report extremely high frequencies of SD (30-50%) in two selected strains, established in 1976, and show it to be responsible for the accumulation of deleterious genes in chromosome II. Samples of chromosomes extracted over a 4-year period were characterized with respect to distortion, sensitivity, lethality, sterility, and inversions. SD chromosomes were inversion-free as they have been shown to be in the Mediterranean area. The cosmopolitan inversion In(2L)t was found associated with SD (+) chromosomes. Lines polymorphic for SD have accumulated linked lethal and female-sterile genes approaching a near balanced system. It is proposed that deleterious genes linked in coupling to SD were accumulated by the balancing effect of distortion, while drift and restricted recombination account for the accumulation of deleterious genes linked in repulsion by a mechanism similar to Muller's ratchet. Our results should not be viewed as a particular case as SD chromosomes associated with detrimental genes and inversions are present in almost all populations around the world. The system could evolve in the way we describe whenever equilibrium conditions are broken down in small populations and lead to an increase in SD frequency.",1993,"A Dominguez, E Santiago, J Albornoz, A Gutierrez, A Dominguez, E Santiago, J Albornoz, A Gutierrez"
Insect proteins homologous to mammalian high mobility group protein 1. Characterization and DNA-binding properties,1512255,,"Two chromosomal high mobility group (HMG) proteins from larvae of Chironomus thummi (Diptera) and from an epithelial cell line of Chironomus tentans were purified to homogeneity and chemically characterized. cDNA clones encoding these proteins were isolated from an expression library using an immunoscreening approach and were sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences revealed their homology to HMG protein 1 of vertebrates. These insect proteins have therefore been designated cHMG1a and cHMG1b. They have a molecular mass of 12,915 and 12,019 kDa, respectively, and preferentially bind to AT-rich DNA. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with a polyclonal antibody showed the presence of cHMG1a and cHMG1b in condensed chromomeres but not in puffs, nucleoli, and cytoplasm. The cHMG1a and cHMG1b genes were both localized to a single band in region 14 of chromosome 1 of C. tentans and appear to be single copy genes. An immunologically related protein was purified from Drosophila melanogaster Kc cells. Its size and amino acid composition indicate that it is an HMG1 of D. melanogaster. On the other hand, our antibody did not recognize calf HMG1. The identification and characterization of HMG1 proteins in insects with polytene chromosomes opens new possibilities for studying function(s) of this group of chromosomal proteins.",1992,"J R Wiśniewski, E Schulze, J R Wiśniewski, E Schulze"
[Cloning and study of inserted sequences of gene 28S in Drosophila melanogaster ribosomal RNA],6280035,,"Cloning of fragments of ribosomal genes containing insertions in the 28S RNA gene has been reported earlier. Subcloning of DNA fragments corresponding to insertion sequences and their hybridization with DNA, RNA and polytene chromosomes from different flies is described. Type 1 insertions (containing BamI sites) are highly heterogeneous in length and sequence even in homozygotes. Type 2 insertions (with EcoRI sites) are rather homogeneous. Two types of insertions are represented in the D. melanogaster genome by 50 and 30 copies, respectively. Restriction fragments with insertions significantly differ in DNA from embryos and larvae. D. simulans and D. virilis also contain the sequences of both types of insertions, though in fewer number of copies. Type 1 insertions seem to be poorly transcribed, and type 2 insertions are not transcribed at all. Among 2000 recombinant clones screened a number of DI plasmids hybridizing to isolated insertions were obtained. Six of them were mapped with restriction endonucleases and hybridized with insertion fragments. rRNA and polytene chromosomes. All of these DI plasmids hybridize with the nucleoli, one with the chromocenter and one with the 79F 3L site.

The Host as the Driver of the Microbiota in the Gut and External Environment of Drosophila melanogaster,26150460,10.1128/AEM.01442-15,"Most associations between animals and their gut microbiota are dynamic, involving sustained transfer of food-associated microbial cells into the gut and shedding of microorganisms into the external environment with feces, but the interacting effects of host and microbial factors on the composition of the internal and external microbial communities are poorly understood. This study on laboratory cultures of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster reared in continuous contact with their food revealed time-dependent changes of the microbial communities in the food that were strongly influenced by the presence and abundance of Drosophila. When germfree Drosophila eggs were aseptically added to nonsterile food, the microbiota in the food and flies converged to a composition dramatically different from that in fly-free food, showing that Drosophila has microbiota-independent effects on the food microbiota. The microbiota in both the flies that developed from unmanipulated eggs (bearing microorganisms) and the associated food was dominated by the bacteria most abundant on the eggs, demonstrating effective vertical transmission via surface contamination of eggs. Food coinoculated with a four-species defined bacterial community of Acetobacter and Lactobacillus species revealed the progressive elimination of Lactobacillus from the food bearing few or no Drosophila, indicating the presence of antagonistic interactions between Acetobacter and Lactobacillus. Drosophila at high densities ameliorated the Acetobacter/Lactobacillus antagonism, enabling Lactobacillus to persist.

The role of commensal microbes in the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster,31299010,10.18632/aging.102073,"Commensal microbes have mutualistic relationships with their host and mainly live in the host intestine. There are many studies on the relationships between commensal microbes and host physiology. However, there are inconsistent results on the effects of commensal microbes on host lifespan. To clarify this controversy, we generated axenic flies by using two controlled methods - bleaching and antibiotic treatment - and investigated the relationship between the commensal microbes and host lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster. The removal of microbes by using bleaching and antibiotic treatments without detrimental effects increased fly lifespan. Furthermore, a strain of flies colonized with a high load of microbiota showed a greater effect on lifespan extension when the microbes were eliminated, suggesting that commensal bacteria abundance may be a critical determinant of host lifespan. Consistent with those observations, microbial flora of aged fly gut significantly decreased axenic fly lifespan via an increase in bacterial load rather than through a change of bacterial composition. Our elaborately controlled experiments showed that the elimination of commensal microbes without detrimental side effects increased fly lifespan, and that bacterial load was a significant determinant of lifespan. Furthermore, our results indicate the presence of a deterministic connection between commensal microbes and host lifespan.",2019,"Hye-Yeon Lee, Shin-Hae Lee, Ji-Hyeon Lee, Won-Jae Lee, Kyung-Jin Min, Hye-Yeon Lee, Shin-Hae Lee, Ji-Hyeon Lee, Won-Jae Lee, Kyung-Jin Min"

To discover novel targets for permethrin synergists, metabolomics was performed on permethrin-treated Drosophila melanogaster. Changes were observed in several metabolic pathways including those for amino acids, glycogen, glycolysis, energy, nitrogen, NAD(+), purine, pyrimidine, lipids and carnitine. Markers for acidosis, ammonia stress, oxidative stress and detoxification responses were also observed. Many of these changes had not been previously characterized after permethrin exposure. From the altered pathways, tryptophan catabolism was selected for further investigation. The knockdown of some tryptophan catabolism genes (vermilion, cinnabar and CG6950) in the whole fly and in specific tissues including fat body, midgut and Malpighian tubules using targeted RNAi resulted in altered survival phenotypes against acute topical permethrin exposure. The knockdown of vermilion, cinnabar and CG6950 in the whole fly also altered survival phenotypes against chronic oral permethrin, fenvalerate, DDT, chlorpyriphos and hydramethylnon exposure. Thus tryptophan catabolism has a previously uncharacterized role in defence against insecticides, and shows that metabolomics is a powerful tool for target identification in pesticide research.",2015,"Robert A Brinzer, Louise Henderson, Alan A Marchiondo, Debra J Woods, Shireen A Davies, Julian A T Dow, Robert A Brinzer, Louise Henderson, Alan A Marchiondo, Debra J Woods, Shireen A Davies, Julian A T Dow"

Neuronal expression of p53 dominant-negative proteins in adult Drosophila melanogaster extends life span,16303568,10.1016/j.cub.2005.10.051,"Hyperactivation of p53 leads to a reduction in tumor formation and an unexpected shortening of life span in two different model systems . The decreased life span occurs with signs of accelerated aging, such as osteoporosis, reduction in body weight, atrophy of organs, decreased stress resistance, and depletion of hematopoietic stem cells. These observations suggest a role for p53 in the determination of life span and the speculation that decreasing p53 activity may result in positive effects on some aging phenotypes . In this report, we show that expression of dominant-negative versions of Drosophila melanogaster p53 in adult neurons extends life span and increases genotoxic stress resistance in the fly. Consistent with this, a naturally occurring allele with decreased p53 activity has been associated with extended survival in humans . Expression of the dominant-negative Drosophila melanogaster p53 constructs does not further increase the extended life span of flies that are calorie restricted, suggesting that a decrease in p53 activity may mediate a component of the calorie-restriction life span-extending pathway in flies.",2005,"Johannes H Bauer, Peter C Poon, Heather Glatt-Deeley, John M Abrams, Stephen L Helfand, Johannes H Bauer, Peter C Poon, Heather Glatt-Deeley, John M Abrams, Stephen L Helfand"

It is considered that prominence of the Feulgen absorption shoulder could be related to the amount of Schiff molecules di-substituted with apurinic acid aldehydes and to the relatively larger resistance of these apurinic acid fragments towards solubilization with acid hydrolysis due to their binding to nuclear proteins. It is therefore assumed that no significant differences owing to the above-cited factors exist for the chromosome regions analyzed at 2 phases of the polytenization process.

Monoassociation with Lactobacillus plantarum Disrupts Intestinal Homeostasis in Adult Drosophila melanogaster,30065090,10.1128/mBio.01114-18,"Adult Drosophila melanogaster raised in the absence of symbiotic bacteria have fewer intestinal stem cell divisions and a longer life span than their conventionally reared counterparts. However, we do not know if increased stem cell divisions are essential for symbiont-dependent regulation of longevity. To determine if individual symbionts cause aging-dependent death in Drosophila, we examined the impacts of common symbionts on host longevity. We found that monoassociation of adult Drosophila with Lactobacillus plantarum, a widely reported fly symbiont and member of the probiotic Lactobacillus genus, curtails adult longevity relative to germfree counterparts. The effects of Lactobacillus plantarum on life span were independent of intestinal aging. Instead, we found that association with Lactobacillus plantarum causes an extensive intestinal pathology within the host, characterized by loss of stem cells, impaired epithelial renewal, and a gradual erosion of epithelial ultrastructure. Our study uncovers an unknown aspect of Lactobacillus plantarum-Drosophila interactions and establishes a simple model to characterize symbiont-dependent disruption of intestinal homeostasis.IMPORTANCE Under homeostatic conditions, gut bacteria provide molecular signals that support the organization and function of the host intestine. Sudden shifts in the composition or distribution of gut bacterial communities impact host receipt of bacterial cues and disrupt tightly regulated homeostatic networks. We used the Drosophila melanogaster model to determine the effects of prominent fly symbionts on host longevity and intestinal homeostasis. We found that monoassociation with Lactobacillus plantarum leads to a loss of intestinal progenitor cells, impaired epithelial renewal, and disruption of gut architecture as flies age.

Drosophila melanogaster as an alternative model organism in nutrigenomics,31080523,10.1186/s12263-019-0641-y,"Nutrigenomics explains the interaction between the genome, the proteome, the epigenome, the metabolome, and the microbiome with the nutritional environment of an organism. It is therefore situated at the interface between an organism's health, its diet, and the genome. The diet and/or specific dietary compounds are able to affect not only the gene expression patterns, but also the epigenetic mechanisms as well as the production of metabolites and the bacterial composition of the microbiota. Drosophila melanogaster provides a well-suited model organism to unravel these interactions in the context of nutrigenomics as it combines several advantages including an affordable maintenance, a short generation time, a high fecundity, a relatively short life expectancy, a well-characterized genome, and the availability of several mutant fly lines. Furthermore, it hosts a mammalian-like intestinal system with a clear microbiota and a fat body resembling the adipose tissue with liver-equivalent oenocytes, supporting the fly as an excellent model organism not only in nutrigenomics but also in nutritional research. Experimental approaches that are essentially needed in nutrigenomic research, including several sequencing technologies, have already been established in the fruit fly. However, studies investigating the interaction of a specific diet and/or dietary compounds in the fly are currently very limited.

The effect of dietary threonine on Adh expression during the development of Drosophila melanogaster,9339891,,"The alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity and ADH cross reacting material (ADH CRM) were measured and Northern blot analysis was carried to define the function and the regulation mechanism of the Adh gene.

Two wild type strains, one homozygous for Adh(F) and one for Adh(S) from Chunan, Korea were used. The ADH activity and CRMs of the Adh(F) strain were 2.1 times higher than those of Adhs strain, and ADH activity was higher with isopropanol (secondary alcohol) than with ethanol (primary alcohol) as a substrate in both Adh(F) and Adh(S) strains. When the larvae, pupae, newly emerged adults (0-1 day), and adults (5-7 days) of Drosophila melanogaster Adh(F) and Adh(S) strains were fed on a defined low yeast and threonine medium, ADH activity and ADH CRM levels were increased. Northern blot analyses indicated that the production of mRNA of the larvae, young adults (0-1 day), and adults (5-7 days) was increased by dietary threonine. ADH activity and ADH CRM increases in Drosophila melanogaster fed on threonine were as a result of threonine-stimulated alteration in the amount of ADH mRNA.

Comparison of targeted-gene replacement frequencies in Drosophila melanogaster at the forked and white loci,8668169,10.1128/mcb.16.7.3535,"P element-induced gene conversion has been previously used to modify the white gene of Drosophila melanogaster in a directed fashion. The applicability of this approach of gene targeting in Drosophila melanogaster, however, has not been analyzed quantitatively for other genes. We took advantage of the P element-induced forked allele, f(hd), which was used as a target, and we constructed a vector containing a modified forked fragment for converting f(hd). Conversion frequencies were analyzed for this locus as well as for an alternative white allele, w(eh812). Combination of both P element-induced mutant genes allowed the simultaneous analysis of conversion frequencies under identical genetic, developmental, and environmental conditions. This paper demonstrates that gene conversion through P element-induced gap repair can be applied with similar success rates at the forked locus and in the white gene. The average conversion frequency at forked was 0.29%, and that at white was 0.17%. These frequencies indicate that in vivo gene targeting in Drosophila melanogaster should be applicable for other genes in this species at manageable rates. We also confirmed the homolog dependence of reversions at the forked locus, indicating that P elements transpose via a cut-and-paste mechanism.

The Saccharomyces and Drosophila heat shock transcription factors are identical in size and DNA binding properties,3100052,10.1016/0092-8674(87)90201-7,"The heat shock transcription factor (HSTF) has been purified to apparent homogeneity from S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster by sequence-specific DNA-affinity chromatography.

This DNA-affinity resin allowed the rapid isolation of a yeast and a Drosophila protein with the same apparent molecular weight (70 kd). The yeast HSTF will bind to both its own and the Drosophila HSEs. Similarly, the Drosophila HSTF will bind to both its own and the yeast HSEs. The yeast and Drosophila HSTFs were subjected to preparative SDS gel electrophoresis, and the 70 kd polypeptides were eluted, renatured, and observed to generate the identical footprint pattern as the native HSTFs.

Calcineurin-dependent Protein Phosphorylation Changes During Egg Activation in Drosophila melanogaster,30478224,10.1074/mcp.RA118.001076,"In almost all animals studied to date, the crucial process of egg activation, by which an arrested mature oocyte transitions into an actively developing embryo, initiates with an increase in Ca2+ in the oocyte's cytoplasm. This Ca2+ rise sets off a series of downstream events, including the completion of meiosis and the dynamic remodeling of the oocyte transcriptome and proteome, which prepares the oocyte for embryogenesis. Calcineurin is a highly conserved phosphatase that is activated by Ca2+ upon egg activation and that is required for the resumption of meiosis in Xenopus,, ascidians, and Drosophila. The molecular mechanisms by which calcineurin transduces the calcium signal to regulate meiosis and other downstream events are still unclear. In this study, we investigate the regulatory role of calcineurin during egg activation in Drosophila melanogaster,. Using mass spectrometry, we quantify the phosphoproteomic and proteomic changes that occur during egg activation, and we examine how these events are affected when calcineurin function is perturbed in female germ cells. Our results show that calcineurin regulates hundreds of phosphosites and also influences the abundance of numerous proteins during egg activation. We find calcineurin-dependent changes in cell cycle regulators including Fizzy (Fzy), Greatwall (Gwl) and Endosulfine (Endos); in protein translation modulators including PNG, NAT, eIF4G, and eIF4B; and in important components of signaling pathways including GSK3β and Akt1.

Ocnus is essential for male germ cell development in Drosophila melanogaster,29732657,10.1111/imb.12393,"The ocnus (ocn) gene encodes a protein abundant in the testes, implying its role in testis development. When Drosophila melanogaster is infected with the endosymbiont wMel Wolbachia, which affects the spermatogenesis of its hosts, ocn is downregulated in the third-instar larval testes, suggesting a role of ocn in spermatogenesis. In this study, we knocked down ocn in the testes and found that the hatch rates of embryos derived from ocn-knockdown males were significantly decreased, and 84.38% of the testes were much smaller in comparison to controls. Analysis of the smaller testes showed no germ cells but they had an extended hub. Using RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq), we identified 69 genes with at least a twofold change (q-value < 5%) in their expression after ocn knockdown; of these, eight testes-specific and three reproduction-related genes were verified to be significantly downregulated using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Three genes (orientation disruptor, p24-2 and CG13541) were also significantly downregulated in the presence of Wolbachia. Furthermore, 98 genes were not expressed when ocn was knocked down in testes. These results suggest that ocn plays a crucial role in male germ cell development in Drosophila, possibly by regulating the expression of multiple spermatogenesis-related genes. Our data provide important information to help understand the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying spermatogenesis.",2018,"Y Zheng, J Bi, M-Y Hou, W Shen, W Zhang, H Ai, X-Q Yu, Y-F Wang, Y Zheng, J Bi, M-Y Hou, W Shen, W Zhang, H Ai, X-Q Yu, Y-F Wang"
Behavioral and electrophysiological analysis of general anesthesia in 3 background strains of Drosophila melanogaster,26267354,10.1080/19336934.2015.1072663,"General anesthetics achieve behavioral unresponsiveness via a mechanism that is incompletely understood. The study of genetic model systems such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is crucial to advancing our understanding of how anesthetic drugs render animals unresponsive. Previous studies have shown that wild-type control strains differ significantly in their sensitivity to general anesthetics, which potentially introduces confounding factors for comparing genetic mutations placed on these wild-type backgrounds. Here, we examined a variety of behavioral and electrophysiological endpoints in Drosophila, in both adult and larval animals. We characterized these endpoints in 3 commonly used fly strains: wild-type Canton Special (CS), and 2 commonly used white-eyed strains, isoCJ1 and w(1118). We found that CS and isoCJ1 show remarkably similar sensitivity to isoflurane across a variety of behavioral and electrophysiological endpoints. In contrast, w(1118) is resistant to isoflurane compared to the other 2 strains at both the adult and larval stages. This resistance is however not reflected at the level of neurotransmitter release at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). This suggests that the w(1118) strain harbors another mutation that produces isoflurane resistance, by acting on an arousal pathway that is most likely preserved between larval and adult brains. This mutation probably also affects sleep, as marked differences between isoCJ1 and w(1118) have also recently been found for behavioral responsiveness and sleep intensity measures.",2015,"Oressia Zalucki, Rebecca Day, Benjamin Kottler, Shanker Karunanithi, Bruno van Swinderen, Oressia Zalucki, Rebecca Day, Benjamin Kottler, Shanker Karunanithi, Bruno van Swinderen"
A new model to study sleep deprivation-induced seizure,25515102,10.5665/sleep.4674,"Background and study objectives:
      
    

    
      A relationship between sleep and seizures is well-described in both humans and rodent animal models; however, the mechanism underlying this relationship is unknown. Using Drosophila melanogaster mutants with seizure phenotypes, we demonstrate that seizure activity can be modified by sleep deprivation.
    

    
  


        Design:
      
    

    
      Seizure activity was evaluated in an adult bang-sensitive seizure mutant, stress sensitive B (sesB(9ed4)), and in an adult temperature sensitive seizure mutant seizure (sei(ts1)) under baseline and following 12 h of sleep deprivation. The long-term effect of sleep deprivation on young, immature sesB(9ed4) flies was also assessed.
    

    
  


        Setting:
      
    

    
      Laboratory.
    

    
  


        Participants:

        Interventions:
      
    

    
      Sleep deprivation.
    

    
  


        Measurements and results:
      
    

    
      Sleep deprivation increased seizure susceptibility in adult sesB(9ed4)/+ and sei(ts1) mutant flies. Sleep deprivation also increased seizure susceptibility when sesB was disrupted using RNAi. The effect of sleep deprivation on seizure activity was reduced when sesB(9ed4)/+ flies were given the anti-seizure drug, valproic acid. In contrast to adult flies, sleep deprivation during early fly development resulted in chronic seizure susceptibility when sesB(9ed4)/+ became adults.

Wild-type and insecticide-resistant homo-oligomeric GABA receptors of Drosophila melanogaster stably expressed in a Drosophila cell line,9014156,10.1016/s0028-3908(96)00087-1,"RDL is an ionotropic GABA receptor subunit, a product of the Rdl gene, originally identified in the Maryland strain of Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we report the generation of a Drosophila melanogaster cell line (S2-RDLA302S) stably expressing a mutated, dieldrin-resistant (A302S) form of RDL. The properties of this dieldrin-resistant, homo-oligomeric receptor have been compared with those of the stably expressed, wild-type form (S2-RDL). Using these stable lines, a striking reduction in sensitivity to both picrotoxinin and dieldrin was observed for responses to GABA of S2-RDLA302S compared to S2-RDL. To determine if these stable insect cell lines generate results similar to those obtained by transient expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes, we have examined the actions of two widely used convulsants, EBOB and TBPS, and a recently developed convulsant BIDN, on RDL-mediated GABA responses in the two expression systems. In both oocytes and S2 cells, the three convulsants suppressed the amplitude of responses to GABA. Thus, in accord with earlier work on agonist and allosteric sites, the S2-RDL cell line is found to yield similar pharmacological results to those obtained in transient expression studies.

Juvenile hormone reveals mosaic developmental programs in the metamorphosing optic lobe of Drosophila melanogaster,29618455,10.1242/bio.034025,"The development of the adult optic lobe (OL) of Drosophila melanogaster is directed by a wave of ingrowth of the photoreceptors over a 2-day period at the outset of metamorphosis, which is accompanied by the appearance of the pupal-specific transcription factor Broad-Z3 (Br-Z3) and expression of early drivers in OL neurons. During this time, there are pulses of ecdysteroids that time the metamorphic events. At the outset, the transient appearance of juvenile hormone (JH) prevents precocious development of the OL caused by the ecdysteroid peak that initiates pupariation, but the artificial maintenance of JH after this time misdirects subsequent development. Axon ingrowth, Br-Z3 appearance and the expression of early drivers were unaffected, but aspects of later development such as the dendritic expansion of the lamina monopolar neurons and the expression of late drivers were suppressed. This effect of the exogenous JH mimic (JHM) pyriproxifen is lost by 24 h after pupariation. Part of this effect of JHM is due to its suppression of the appearance of ecdysone receptor EcR-B1 that occurs after pupation and during early adult development.",2018,"Lynn M Riddiford, James W Truman, Aljoscha Nern, Lynn M Riddiford, James W Truman, Aljoscha Nern"

Although various beneficial effects of cucurbitacin such as alleviating hyperglycemia have also been documented, it is not clear what kinds of molecular sensors are required to detect cucurbitacin in nature. Cucurbitacin B, a major bitter component of bitter melon, was applied to induce action potentials from sensilla of a mouth part of the fly, labellum. Here we identify that only Gr33a is required for activating bitter-sensing gustatory receptor neurons by cucurbitacin B among available 26 Grs, 23 Irs, 11 Trp mutants, and 26 Gr-RNAi lines. We further investigated the difference between control and Gr33a mutant by analyzing binary food choice assay. We also measured toxic effect of Cucurbitacin B over 0.01 mM range.

Our approach is easy-to-use, has low computational costs, and enables high-throughput experiments. After automatically segmenting the heart region of the pupa in an image sequence, the heartbeat is indirectly determined based on intensity variation analysis. We have evaluated our method using 47,631 manually annotated frames from 29 image sequences recorded with different temporal and spatial resolutions which are made publicly available. We show that our algorithm is both precise since it detects more than 95% of the heartbeats correctly as well as robust since the same standardized set of parameters can be used for all sequences.

The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster provides an excellent model system to study autophagy in vivo, in the context of a developing organism. Autophagy (atg) genes and their regulators are conserved in Drosophila, and autophagy is induced in response to nutrient starvation and hormones during development. In this review we provide an overview of how Drosophila research has contributed to our understanding of the role and regulation of autophagy in cell survival, growth, nutrient utilization, and cell death. Recent Drosophila research has also provided important mechanistic information about the role of autophagy in protein aggregation disorders, neurodegeneration, aging, and innate immunity.

Searching for sleep mutants of Drosophila melanogaster,14505361,10.1002/bies.10333,"The functions of sleep are still unknown, but are probably related to cellular and molecular aspects of neural function. To better understand the benefits that sleep may bring at the cellular level, recent studies have employed Drosophila melanogaster as a model system and shown that fruit flies share the fundamental features of mammalian sleep. As in mammals, sleep in Drosophila is characterized by increased arousal threshold and by changes in brain electrical activity. Fly sleep is homeostatically regulated independent of the circadian clock, is modulated by stimulants and hypnotics, and is affected by age. Also, fly sleep is associated with changes in brain gene expression similar to those observed in mammals. While Drosophila neurobiology is sufficiently complex to permit meaningful generalizations to mammals and humans, Drosophila genetics is simple enough to allow a rapid mutagenesis screening. An ongoing mutagenesis study has screened approximately 5000 mutant Drosophila lines and found that sleep amount, sleep pattern, and the homeostatic regulation of sleep are highly conserved phenotypes in flies. So far, this study has identified 10 short sleeper lines and 4 lines that show no sleep rebound after sleep deprivation.

This was done by treating Drosophila Schneider 2 cells with vanadate/peroxide, which has been shown to closely mimic some signaling events triggered by interferon gamma, including the activation of Jak1, Jak2, and the Stat1 alpha protein. Evidence presented here demonstrates that vanadate/peroxide can induce a gamma response region binding complex in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells.

We have cloned the armadillo gene from the housefly, Musca domestica, which diverged from Drosophila 100 million years ago. The Musca protein is 97.5% identical to that in Drosophila, while the noncoding sequences have diverged extensively. This remarkable degree of conservation at the protein level is mirrored in the expression pattern of the armadillo protein.

Knotting of the circular duplex DNA by type II DNA topoisomerase from Drosophila melanogaster,6305983,,"DNA molecules with topological knots can be detected in a reaction mixture of circular DNA and type II DNA topoisomerase purified from the embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. Similar to the DNA knotting reaction by bacteriophage T4-induced topoisomerase (Liu, L. F., Liu, C. C., and Alberts, B. M. (1980) Cell 19, 697-707), the knotting reaction by the Drosophila topoisomerase II requires a high ratio of enzyme/DNA. However, they differ in the following aspects: 1) the knotting reaction by the Drosophila enzyme is greatly stimulated by the presence of ATP; 2) the knotted DNA is a stable product in the reaction mixture over prolonged incubation; and 3) both the covalently closed circular DNA and its nicked form, which is devoid of any superhelical structure, can be knotted. The knotted DNA generated by the Drosophila topoisomerase II can be efficiently unknotted by a catalytic amount of Drosophila topoisomerase II, but not by topoisomerase I. The ionic strength optimum for the knotting reaction is close, but not identical, to the optimal condition for the unknotting and supercoil relaxation reactions.

As shown earlier, the interspersion of repetitive and single-copy sequence is of the short-period form in Musca, and is of the long-period form in Drosophila. The egg RNA complexities were determined by hybridization of excess RNA with radioactively labeled single-copy DNA. Complexity is expressed as the length (in nucleotides) of diverse single-copy sequence represented in the RNA. The complexity of the RNA of the Musca egg is about 2.4 X 10(7) nucleotides, and that of the Drosophila egg is about 1.2 X 10(7) nucleotides.

Phycoerythrin averts intracellular ROS generation and physiological functional decline in eukaryotes under oxidative stress,27335008,10.1007/s00709-016-0996-5,"In vitro antioxidant virtue and life-prolonging effect of phycoerythrin (PE; a pigment protein isolated from Phormidium sp.

It has been hypothesized that the PE expands life span of Caenorhabditis elegans (bears large resemblance with human aging pathways) due to its antioxidant virtue. This hypothesis is tested in present study by checking the effect of PE on intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and associated physiological deformities using mouse and human skin fibroblasts, C. elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster Oregon R + and by divulging PE's structural attributes responsible for its antioxidant asset. PE treatment displayed noteworthy decrease of 67, 48, and 77 % in ROS level in mouse fibroblast (3T3-L1), human fibroblast, and C. elegans N2, respectively, arisen under chemical-induced oxidative stress. PE treatment delayed the development of paraquat-induced Alzheimer phenotype by 14.5 % in C. elegans CL4176. Furthermore, PE improved the locomotion of D. melanogaster Oregon R + under oxidative stress with simultaneous up-regulation in super-oxide dismutase and catalase activities. The existence of 52 Glu + Asp + His + Thr residues (having metal ion sequestration capacity), 5 phycoerythrobilin chromophores (potential electron exchangers) in PE's primary structure, and significant hydrophobic patches on the surface of its α- and β-subunits are supposed to collectively contribute in the antioxidant virtues of PE.

Function of Glu-469' in the acid-base catalysis of thioredoxin reductase from Drosophila melanogaster,18991392,10.1021/bi801449h,"Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) catalyzes the reduction of thioredoxin (Trx) by NADPH. Because dipteran insects such as Drosophila melanogaster lack glutathione reductase, their TrxRs are particularly important for antioxidant protection; reduced Trx reacts nonenzymatically with oxidized glutathione to maintain a high glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio. Like other members of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family, TrxR is a homodimer; in the enzyme from D. melanogaster (DmTrxR), each catalytically active unit consists of three redox centers: FAD and an N-terminal Cys-57-Cys-62 redox-active disulfide from one monomer and a Cys-489'-Cys-490' C-terminal redox-active disulfide from the second monomer. A dyad of His-464' and Glu-469' in TrxR acts as the acid-base catalyst of the dithiol-disulfide interchange reactions required in catalysis [Huang, H.-H., et al. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 1721-1731]. In this investigation, the role of Glu-469' in catalysis by DmTrxR has been studied. The E469'A and E469'Q DmTrxR variants retain 28 and 35% of the wild-type activity, respectively, indicating that this glutamate residue is important but not critical to catalysis. The pH dependence of V(max) for both glutamate variants yields pK(a) values of 6.0 and 8.7, compared to those in the wild-type enzyme of 6.4 and 9.3, respectively, indicating that the basicity of His-464' in TrxR in complex with its substrate, DmTrx-2, is significantly lower in the glutamate variants than in wild-type enzyme. The rates of some steps in the reductive half-reactions in both glutamate variants are much slower than those of the wild-type enzyme. On the basis of our observations, it is proposed that the function of Glu-469' is to facilitate the positioning of His-464' toward the interchange thiol, Cys-57, as suggested for the analogous residue in glutathione reductase.",2008,"Hsin-Hung Huang, L David Arscott, David P Ballou, Charles H Williams, Hsin-Hung Huang, L David Arscott, David P Ballou, Charles H Williams"

In vitro characterization of a novel Isu homologue from Drosophila melanogaster for de novo FeS-cluster formation,27738674,10.1039/c6mt00163g,"FeS-clusters are utilized by numerous proteins within several biological pathways that are essential for life. In eukaryotes, the primary FeS-cluster production pathway is the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) pathway. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, de novo FeS-cluster formation is accomplished through coordinated assembly with the substrates iron and sulfur by the scaffold assembly protein ""Isu1"". Sulfur for cluster assembly is provided by cysteine desulfurase ""Nfs1"", a protein that works in union with its accessory protein ""Isd11"". Frataxin ""Yfh1"" helps direct cluster assembly by serving as a modulator of Nfs1 activity, by assisting in the delivery of sulfur and Fe(ii) to Isu1, or more likely through a combination of these and other possible roles. In vitro studies on the yeast ISC machinery have been limited, however, due to the inherent instability of recombinant Isu1. Isu1 is a molecule prone to degradation and aggregation. To circumvent Isu1 instability, we have replaced yeast Isu1 with the fly ortholog to stabilize our in vitro ISC assembly system and assist us in elucidating molecular details of the yeast ISC pathway. Our laboratory previously observed that recombinant frataxin from Drosophila melanogaster has remarkable stability compared to the yeast ortholog. Here we provide the first characterization of D. melanogaster Isu1 (fIscU) and demonstrate its ability to function within the yeast ISC machinery both in vivo and in vitro. Recombinant fIscU has physical properties similar to that of yeast Isu1. It functions as a stable dimer with similar Fe(ii) affinity and ability to form two 2Fe-2S clusters as the yeast dimer. The fIscU and yeast ISC proteins are compatible in vitro; addition of Yfh1 to Nfs1-Isd11 increases the rate of FeS-cluster formation on fIscU to a similar extent observed with Isu1. Finally, fIscU expressed in mitochondria of a yeast strain lacking Isu1 (and its paralog Isu2) is able to completely reverse the deletion phenotypes. These results demonstrate fIscU can functionally replace yeast Isu1 and it can serve as a powerful tool for exploring molecular details within the yeast ISC pathway.",2017,"Stephen P Dzul, Agostinho G Rocha, Swati Rawat, Ashoka Kandegedara, April Kusowski, Jayashree Pain, Anjaneyulu Murari, Debkumar Pain, Andrew Dancis, Timothy L Stemmler, Stephen P Dzul, Agostinho G Rocha, Swati Rawat, Ashoka Kandegedara, April Kusowski, Jayashree Pain, Anjaneyulu Murari, Debkumar Pain, Andrew Dancis, Timothy L Stemmler"
Genome-Wide Association Study on Male Genital Shape and Size in Drosophila melanogaster,26182199,10.1371/journal.pone.0132846,"Male genital morphology of animals with internal fertilization and promiscuous mating systems have been one of the most diverse and rapidly evolving morphological traits. The male genital morphology in general is known to have low phenotypic and genetic variations, but the genetic basis of the male genital variation remains unclear. Drosophila melanogaster and its closely related species are morphologically very similar, but the shapes of the posterior lobe, a cuticular projection on the male genital arch are distinct from each other, representing a model system for studying the genetic basis of male genital morphology. In this study, we used highly inbred whole genome sequenced strains of D. melanogaster to perform genome wide association analysis on posterior lobe morphology. We quantified the outline shape of posterior lobes with Fourier coefficients obtained from elliptic Fourier analysis and performed principal component analysis, and posterior lobe size. The first and second principal components (PC1 and PC2) explained approximately 88% of the total variation of the posterior lobe shape. We then examined the association between the principal component scores and posterior lobe size and 1902142 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). As a result, we obtained 15, 14 and 15 SNPs for PC1, PC2 and posterior lobe size with P-values smaller than 10(-5). Based on the location of the SNPs, 13, 13 and six protein coding genes were identified as potential candidates for PC1, PC2 and posterior lobe size, respectively. In addition to the previous findings showing that the intraspecific posterior shape variation are regulated by multiple QTL with strong effects, the present study suggests that the intraspecific variation may be under polygenic regulation with a number of loci with small effects. Further studies are required for investigating whether these candidate genes are responsible for the intraspecific posterior lobe shape variation.",2015,"Baku Takahara, Kazuo H Takahashi, Baku Takahara, Kazuo H Takahashi"
A partial map of the circular mitochondrial genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Location of EcoRI-sensitive sites and the adenine-thymine-rich region,825520,10.1083/jcb.71.2.434,"The mitochondrial genome of Drosophila melanogaster is a circular DNA molecule of mol wt 12.35 X 10(6) daltons. A single region accounting for approx. 25% of this molecule can be reproducibly differentially denatured presumably because it is rich in adenine and thymine. We have mapped on the circular mitochondrial genome of D. melanogaster the relative positions of this adenine-thymine (A-T) rich region and the sites sensitive to cleavage by the restriction endonuclease EcoRI, using agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. Digestion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules to completion with EcoRI resulted in the production of four fragments, A, B, C, and D which represent (+/- SD) 58.9 +/- 1.1%, 27.5 +/- 0.8%, 8.9 +/- 0.5%, and 4.5 +/- 0.3%, of the circular genome length, respectively. Fragments produced by EcoRI digestion and circularized by incubation at 2 degrees C also fell into four distinct length groups with means (+/- SD) of 59.1 +/- 0.5%, 27.5 +/- 0.5%, 9.2 +/- 0.3%, and 4.6 +/- 0.2% of the circular genome length. From a consideration of the lengths of fragments resulting from incomplete EcoRI digestion, it was determined that the arrangement of the fragments in the circular genome was A-C-B-D. By electron microscope examination of partially denatured EcoRI fragments, the A-T-rich region was shown to be located in the A fragment closer to one end than to the other. By similar partial-denaturation studies of fragments resulting from incomplete EcoRI digestion, it was determined that, in the circular genome, of the two EcoRI sites which define the limits of the A fragment, the site between the A and D fragment lies nearest to the A-T-rich region.",1976,"D R Wolstenholme, C M Fauron, D R Wolstenholme, C M Fauron"

Neryl acetate has the lowest interaction energy (-87 kcal/mol) against active site of acetylcholinesterase, which is comparable to the ones of methiocarb and pirimicarb (-90 kcal/mol) and reported PDB binder 9-(3-iodobenzylamino)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine (-112.67 kcal/mol). Interaction stability was verified by molecular dynamics simulations and showed that the stability of ACHE active site complexes with three selected terpenes is comparable to the one of the pirimicarb and methiocarb.

Mosaic Analysis in the Drosophila melanogaster Ovary,26324428,10.1007/978-1-4939-2851-4_3,"Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis is a versatile model system used to address many important questions of cell and developmental biology such as stem cell regulation, cell determination, cell polarization, cell-cell signaling, cell-cell adhesion, and cell-cycle regulation. The ovary is composed of germline and somatic cells of different origins and functions. Mosaic analysis using the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila melanogaster allows deciphering the contribution of each cell type in the different processes leading to the formation of a mature egg. Germ cells and follicle cells are produced by actively dividing stem cells, which permit the use of recombinases, such as FLP, to generate genetic mosaics using mitotic recombination. This chapter summarizes the different methods used to create genetic mosaics in the germline and in somatic cells of adult ovaries. We briefly introduce the morphology and development of the adult female ovary. We then describe in practical terms how to generate mosaics with examples of cross schemes and recombining strains. We also explain how to identify the appropriate progeny and how to prepare clonal tissues for phenotypic analysis.",2015,"Thomas Rubin, Jean-René Huynh, Thomas Rubin, Jean-René Huynh"
Characterization of the Drosophila melanogaster alkali-metal/proton exchanger (NHE) gene family,11719534,,"The NHE family of Na+/H+ exchangers is believed to play an essential role in animals, but may play an additional, specialised epithelial role in insects. The pharmacological sensitivity of the Drosophila melanogaster Malpighian tubule to a range of amiloride derivatives was shown to be consistent with an effect on an exchanger, rather than a Na+ channel. Consistent with this, no degenerin/epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) genes could be detected in Malpighian tubules by reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using a low-stringency homology searching, three members of the NHE family were identified in the genomic sequence of Drosophila melanogaster, although only two genes were represented as expressed sequence tags. All three genes (DmNHE1 at cytological position 21B1, DmNHE2 at 39B1 and DmNHE3 at 27A1) were found by RT-PCR to be widely expressed, and one (DmNHE2) was shown to have multiple transcripts.

Amino acid quality modifies the quantitative availability of protein for reproduction in Drosophila melanogaster,32229142,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2020.104050,"Diet composition, especially the relative abundance of key macronutrients, is well known to affect animal wellbeing by changing reproductive output, metabolism and length of life. However, less attention has been paid to the ways the quality of these nutrients modify these macronutrient interactions. Nutritional Geometry can be used to model the effects of multiple dietary components on life-history traits and to compare these responses when diet quality is varied. Previous studies have shown that dietary protein quality can be increased for egg production in Drosophila melanogaster by matching the dietary amino acid proportions to the balance of amino acids used by the sum of proteins in the fly's in silico translated exome. Here, we show that dietary protein quality dramatically alters the effect of protein quantity on female reproduction across a broad range of diets varying in both protein and carbohydrate concentrations. These data show that when sources of ingredients vary, their relative value to the consumer can vastly differ and yield very different physiological outcomes. Such variations could be particularly important for meta analyses that look to draw generalisable conclusions from diverse studies.",2020,"Carolyn Ma, Christen K Mirth, Matthew D Hall, Matthew D W Piper, Carolyn Ma, Christen K Mirth, Matthew D Hall, Matthew D W Piper"
Prepupal building behavior in Drosophila melanogaster and its evolution under resource and time constraints,25671711,10.1371/journal.pone.0117280,"Structures built by animals are a widespread and ecologically important 'extended phenotype'. While its taxonomic diversity has been well described, factors affecting short-term evolution of building behavior within a species have received little experimental attention. Here we describe how, given the opportunity, wandering Drosophila melanogaster larvae often build long tunnels in agar substrates and embed their pupae within them. These embedded larvae are characterized by a longer egg-to-pupariation developmental time than larvae that pupate on the surface. Assuming that such building behaviors are likely to be energetically costly and/or time consuming, we hypothesized that they should evolve to be less pronounced under resource or time limitation. In accord with this prediction, larvae from populations evolved for 160 generations under a regime that combines larval malnutrition with limited developmental time dug shorter tunnels than larvae from control unselected populations. However, the proportion of larvae that embedded before pupation did not differ between the malnutrition-adapted and control populations, suggesting that tunnel length and likelihood of embedding before pupation are controlled by different genetic loci. The behaviors exhibited by wandering larvae of Drosophila melanogaster prior to pupation offer a model system to study evolution of animal building behaviors because the tunneling and embedding phenotypes are simple, facultative and highly variable.",2015,"Sunitha Narasimha, Sylvain Kolly, Marla B Sokolowski, Tadeusz J Kawecki, Roshan K Vijendravarma, Sunitha Narasimha, Sylvain Kolly, Marla B Sokolowski, Tadeusz J Kawecki, Roshan K Vijendravarma"

Under hyperoxia or in a Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase-deficient background, cocoa exhibited a strong antioxidant activity, significantly increasing the average life span. Nevertheless, cocoa supplementation in a Mn-superoxide dismutase-deficient background enhanced an earlier mortality accompanied by a loss of climbing ability, indicating that cocoa may act as a pro-oxidant in mitochondria under conditions of extreme oxidative stress. Finally, we illustrate that cocoa also acts as a metal chelator in the presence of excess heavy metals, enhancing larval survival to the adult stage on copper or iron-supplemented medium.

Effects of unpaired 1 gene overexpression on the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster,30836998,10.1186/s12918-019-0687-x,"Background:
      
    

    
      The JAK/STAT signaling pathway is involved in many aging-related cellular functions. However, effects of overexpression of genes controlling JAK/STAT signal transduction on longevity of model organisms have not been studied. Here we evaluate the effect of overexpression of the unpaired 1 (upd1) gene, which encodes an activating ligand for JAK/STAT pathway, on the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Overexpression of upd1 in the intestine caused a pronounced shortening of the median lifespan by 54.1-18.9%, and the age of 90% mortality by 40.9-19.1% in males and females, respectively. In fat body and in nervous system of male flies, an induction of upd1 overexpression increased the age of 90% mortality and median lifespan, respectively. An increase in upd1 expression enhanced mRNA levels of the JAK/STAT target genes domeless and Socs36E.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:

miR-958 inhibits Toll signaling and Drosomycin expression via direct targeting of Toll and Dif in Drosophila melanogaster,27974298,10.1152/ajpcell.00251.2016,"Drosophila melanogaster is widely used as a model system to study innate immunity and signaling pathways related to innate immunity, including the Toll signaling pathway.

In this study, we used an in silico strategy in combination with the Gal80ts-Gal4 driver system to identify microRNA-958 (miR-958) as a candidate Toll pathway regulating miRNA in Drosophila We report that overexpression of miR-958 significantly reduces the expression of Drosomycin, a key antimicrobial peptide involved in Toll signaling and the innate immune response. We further demonstrate in vitro and in vivo that miR-958 targets the Toll and Dif genes, key components of the Toll signaling pathway, to negatively regulate Drosomycin expression. In addition, a miR-958 sponge rescued the expression of Toll and Dif, resulting in increased expression of Drosomycin. These results, not only revealed a novel function and modulation pattern of miR-958, but also provided a new insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of Toll signaling in regulation of innate immunity.",2017,"Shengjie Li, Yao Li, Li Shen, Ping Jin, Liming Chen, Fei Ma, Shengjie Li, Yao Li, Li Shen, Ping Jin, Liming Chen, Fei Ma"

Eight miRNAs were confirmed to be involved in the Toll-mediated immune response upon Gram-positive bacterial infection through genetic screening of 41 UAS-miRNA lines covering 60 miRNAs of the 93 IRR miRNAs. Interestingly, four out of these eight miRNAs, miR-310, miR-311, miR-312 and miR-313, are clustered miRNAs and belong to the miR-310 family.

Mutagenicity of sodium azide and its metabolite azidoalanine in Drosophila melanogaster,10984686,10.1016/s1383-5718(00)00079-6,"The mutagenic and toxic activities of sodium azide (NaN(3) ) and its organic metabolite L-azidoalanine [N(3)-CH(2)-CH(NH)(2)-COOH] were examined in the different stages of spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Both azide and azidoalanine were toxic to the injected males, but azidoalanine was significantly less toxic than sodium azide. Following the injection with 0.2 microl of these compounds in the hemocoel of young adult wild-type males, the minimum concentrations of these compounds with complete toxic effects (zero survival) were 40 mM sodium azide and 160 mM azidoalanine. Sex-linked recessive lethals were scored by the Muller-5 method in three successive broods, representing sperms (brood A), spermatids (brood B), and a compiled group of meiotic and premeiotic germ cell stages (brood C). The results provide strong experimental evidence that azidoalanine is significantly (p<0.01) mutagenic to all stages of spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Sodium azide, however, was not significantly (p>0.05) mutagenic and did not increase the rate of sex-linked recessive lethals over those produced by the control group injected with 0.45% NaCl. These results indicate the requirement of metabolic activation of azide in Drosophila as a prerequisite for its mutagenic effects.",2000,"M F Sadiq, W M Owais, M F Sadiq, W M Owais"
The smaller protein formed as a ubiquitin fusion in Drosophila is processed from ubiquitin and found on the 60S ribosomal subunit,8111427,10.1016/0965-1748(94)90085-x,"The only gene in Drosophila melanogaster for a 52 amino acid ribosomal protein (CEP52) is fused to a ubiquitin coding sequence. This study examines expression and proteolytic processing of the encoded fusion protein. Most antibody preparations made against a portion of human CEP52 readily detect the insect protein. The size of the immunoreactive polypeptide indicates that CEP52 is cleaved from ubiquitin and this apparent proteolytic processing was confirmed by amino-terminal sequence analysis of CEP52 isolated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Ribosomes from embryonic, larval and adult Drosophila melanogaster contain equivalent amounts of CEP52 and the protein is associated with the large ribosomal subunit. Stained two-dimensional gels indicate that the quantity of CEP52 associated with ribosomes is similar to that of other ribosomal proteins of corresponding size. A previous investigation had indicated the possibility of intact ubiquitin-CEP52 fusion protein in Dictyostelium discoideum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster. One of three antibody preparations used in this study of insect CEP52 reacts with a 40S subunit protein that is the correct size to be the uncleaved fusion protein. However, the putative fusion protein does not react with ubiquitin antibodies and has negligible positive charge at pH5, demonstrating that it is not unprocessed ubiquitin-CEP52.",1994,"K L Redman, K L Redman"
"Genetic, molecular and developmental analysis of the glutamine synthetase isozymes of Drosophila melanogaster",7896146,10.1007/BF01443441,"The glutamine synthetase isozymes of Drosophila melanogaster offer an attractive model for the study of the molecular genetics and evolution of a small gene family encoding enzymatic isoforms that evolved to assume a variety of specific and sometimes essential biological functions. In Drosophila melanogaster two GS isozymes have been described which exhibit different cellular localisation and are coded by a two-member gene family. The mitochondrial GS structural gene resides at the 21B region of the second chromosome, the structural gene for the cytosolic isoform at the 10B region of the X chromosome. cDNA clones corresponding to the two genes have been isolated and sequenced. Evolutionary analysis data are in accord with the hypothesis that the two Drosophila glutamine synthetase genes are derived from a duplication event that occurred near the time of divergence between Insecta and Vertebrata. Both isoforms catalyse all reactions catalysed by other glutamine synthetases, but the different kinetic parameters and the different cellular compartmentalisation suggest strong functional specialisation. In fact, mutations of the mitochondrial GS gene produce embryo-lethal female sterility, defining a function of the gene product essential for the early stages of embryonic development. Preliminary results show strikingly distinct spatial and temporal patterns of expression of the two isoforms at later stages of development.",1994,"C Caggese, P Barsanti, L Viggiano, M P Bozzetti, R Caizzi, C Caggese, P Barsanti, L Viggiano, M P Bozzetti, R Caizzi"

Evidence for a multiple function of the alcohol dehydrogenase allozyme ADH71k of Drosophila melanogaster,2419025,10.1016/0305-0491(85)90536-x,"Alcohol dehydrogenase of Drosophila melanogaster catalyzes the oxidation of many primary and secondary alcohols. We show that sarcosine, choline and dihydroorotate are substrates of ADH in vitro. The first two substrates are regular substrates of the choline shunt, and the latter of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Differences in oxidative ability towards sarcosine and dihydroorotate between two ADH allozymes, ADH71k and ADHF, are observed. The catalytic activity of ADH71k towards sarcosine and dihydroorotate might be responsible for its allelic fixation in Notch8 mutant stocks, in which Notch females have a decreased level of the regular enzymes for these substrates. Their oxidation by ADH71k might act as a bypass, which restores at least part of the decreased activity of enzymes encoded by the Notch locus.",1985,"K T Eisses, W G Schoonen, W Scharloo, G E Thörig, K T Eisses, W G Schoonen, W Scharloo, G E Thörig"

Behavior genetics of choice of oviposition sites in Drosophila melanogaster. I. Genetic variability and analysis of behavior,6775626,10.1007/BF01067322,Females of Drosophila melanogaster were given a choice of oviposition site either on the surface of the medium or on the surface of paper positioned vertically on the medium. A significant difference was seen in the proportion of eggs deposited on the paper among wild strains of different geographic origins. Bidirectional selection for oviposition on these two sites was effective. These selected lines were examined under various conditions to determine the factors involved in this site selection for oviposition. The lines that chose medium laid eggs only on substrates into which eggs could be inserted. The lines preferring paper showed no strict requirement for burying their eggs. Tarsal sensillae were involved in site discrimination.,1980,"T Takamura, Y Fuyama, T Takamura, Y Fuyama"

Enzymatic variation at seven loci in nine natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster,406898,10.1007/BF00520200,Allozyme polymorphisms at seven loci have been studied in nine natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster from the Saône and Rhône valleys sampled in 1973 and 1974. A great deal of polymorphism was observed; an individual was on the average heterozygous at 20.2% of its loci. The populations were genetically very homogeneous throughout the region sampled. The number of ovariolae per female varied from one group of populations to another depending on their geographical separation. Yet the number of ovariolae remained constant from one year to the next. The results show that migration alone cannot explain the homogeneity of the allozyme frequencies. It seems reasonable to conclude that selection plays a major role in maintaining the homogeneity of populations living in proximal biotopes.,1977,"P Girard, L Palabost, C Petit, P Girard, L Palabost, C Petit"

Measuring passive myocardial stiffness in Drosophila melanogaster to investigate diastolic dysfunction,22225769,10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01517.x,"Aging is marked by a decline in LV diastolic function, which encompasses abnormalities in diastolic relaxation, chamber filling and/or passive myocardial stiffness. Genetic tractability and short life span make Drosophila melanogaster an ideal organism to study the effects of aging on heart function, including senescent-associated changes in gene expression and in passive myocardial stiffness. However, use of the Drosophila heart tube to probe deterioration of diastolic performance is subject to at least two challenges: the extent of genetic homology to mammals and the ability to resolve mechanical properties of the bilayered fly heart, which consists of a ventral muscle layer that covers the contractile cardiomyocytes. Here, we argue for widespread use of Drosophila as a novel myocardial aging model by (1) describing diastolic dysfunction in flies, (2) discussing how critical pathways involved in dysfunction are conserved across species and (3) demonstrating the advantage of an atomic force microscopy-based analysis method to measure stiffness of the multilayered Drosophila heart tube versus isolated myocytes from other model systems.

We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with six genes with a significant (p < 10-08, corresponding to a false discovery rate of 2.4%) association with survival, none of which were canonical immune genes. To validate the role of these genes in immune defense, their expression was knocked-down using RNAi and survival of infected hosts was followed, which confirmed a role for the genes krishah and S6k in immune defense. We further identified a putative role for the Bomanin gene BomBc1 (also known as IM23), in E. faecalis infection response.

Altered differential hemocyte count in 3rd instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster as a response to chronic exposure of Acephate,27486365,10.1515/intox-2015-0013,"Acephate, an organophosphate (OP) pesticide, was used to investigate the effects of its chronic exposure on hemocyte abundance in a non-target dipteran insect Drosophila melanogaster. For this purpose, six graded concentrations ranging from 1 to 6 μg/ml were selected, which are below the reported residual values (up to 14 μg/ml) of the chemical. 1(st) instar larvae were fed with these concentrations up to the 3(rd) instar stage and accordingly hemolymph smears from these larvae were prepared for differential hemocyte count. Three types of cells are found in Drosophila hemolymph, namely, plasmatocytes, lamellocytes and crystal cells. Plasmatocyte count was found to decrease with successive increase in treatment concentrations. Crystal cells showed an increasing trend in their number. Though the number of lamellocytes was very low, a bimodal response was noticed. Lamellocyte number was found to increase with the initial three concentrations, followed by a dose dependent reduction in their number. As hemocytes are directly linked to the immune system of fruit flies, fluctuations in normal titer of these cells may affect insect immunity. Hemocytes share homologies in their origin and mode of action with the immune cells of higher organisms including man. Thus the present findings suggest that immune cells of humans and other organisms may be affected adversely under chronic exposure to Acephate.",2015,"Prem Rajak, Moumita Dutta, Sumedha Roy, Prem Rajak, Moumita Dutta, Sumedha Roy"
Genetic composition of social groups influences male aggressive behaviour and fitness in natural genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster,24068359,10.1098/rspb.2013.1926,"Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) describe how an individual's behaviour-which is influenced by his or her genotype-can affect the behaviours of interacting individuals. IGE research has focused on dyads. However, insights from social networks research, and other studies of group behaviour, suggest that dyadic interactions are affected by the behaviour of other individuals in the group. To extend IGE inferences to groups of three or more, IGEs must be considered from a group perspective. Here, I introduce the 'focal interaction' approach to study IGEs in groups. I illustrate the utility of this approach by studying aggression among natural genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster. I chose two natural genotypes as 'focal interactants': the behavioural interaction between them was the 'focal interaction'. One male from each focal interactant genotype was present in every group, and I varied the genotype of the third male-the 'treatment male'. Genetic variation in the treatment male's aggressive behaviour influenced the focal interaction, demonstrating that IGEs in groups are not a straightforward extension of IGEs measured in dyads. Further, the focal interaction influenced male mating success, illustrating the role of IGEs in behavioural evolution. These results represent the first manipulative evidence for IGEs at the group level.",2013,"Julia B Saltz, Julia B Saltz"
Multi-channel acoustic recording and automated analysis of Drosophila courtship songs,23369160,10.1186/1741-7007-11-11,"Background:
      
    

    
      Drosophila melanogaster has served as a powerful model system for genetic studies of courtship songs. To accelerate research on the genetic and neural mechanisms underlying courtship song, we have developed a sensitive recording system to simultaneously capture the acoustic signals from 32 separate pairs of courting flies as well as software for automated segmentation of songs.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Our novel hardware design enables recording of low amplitude sounds in most laboratory environments. We demonstrate the power of this system by collecting, segmenting and analyzing over 18 hours of courtship song from 75 males from five wild-type strains of Drosophila melanogaster. Our analysis reveals previously undetected modulation of courtship song features and extensive natural genetic variation for most components of courtship song. Despite having a large dataset with sufficient power to detect subtle modulations of song, we were unable to identify previously reported periodic rhythms in the inter-pulse interval of song. We provide detailed instructions for assembling the hardware and for using our open-source segmentation software.

Our new system for recording and analyzing fly acoustic signals should therefore greatly accelerate future studies of the genetics, neurobiology and evolution of courtship song.",2013,"Benjamin J Arthur, Tomoko Sunayama-Morita, Philip Coen, Mala Murthy, David L Stern, Benjamin J Arthur, Tomoko Sunayama-Morita, Philip Coen, Mala Murthy, David L Stern"
An infection of Enterobacter ludwigii affects development and causes age-dependent neurodegeneration in Drosophila melanogaster,31641932,10.1007/s10158-019-0233-y,"The effects of teeth-blackening bacteria Enterobacter ludwigii on the physiological system were investigated using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. The bacteria were mixed with the fly food, and its effect was checked on the growth, development and behaviour of Drosophila. Microbes generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the haemolymph of the larvae once it enters into the body. The increased amount of ROS was evidenced by the NBT assay and using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate dye, which indicates the mitochondrial ROS. The increased amount of ROS resulted in a number of abnormal nuclei within the gut. Besides that larvae walking became sluggish in comparison with wild type although the larvae crawling path did not change much. Flies hatched from the infectious larvae have the posterior scutellar bristle absent from the thorax and abnormal mechanosensory hairs in the eye, and they undergo time-dependent neurodegeneration as evidenced by the geotrophic and phototrophic assays. To decipher the mechanism of neurodegeneration, flies were checked for the presence of four important bioamines: tyramine, cadaverine, putrescine and histamine. Out of these four, histamine was found to be absent in infected flies. Histamine is a key molecule required for the functioning of the photoreceptor as well as mechanoreceptors.

Using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, we found that Chd1 deletion mutant flies exhibit significantly reduced microbial diversity compared to rescued control strains. Specifically, although Acetobacteraceae dominated the microbiota of both Chd1 wild-type and mutant guts, Chd1 mutants were virtually monoassociated with this bacterial family, whereas in control flies other bacterial taxa constituted ~20% of the microbiome. We further show age-linked differences in microbial load and microbiota composition between Chd1 mutant and control flies. Finally, diet supplementation experiments with Lactobacillus plantarum revealed that, in contrast to wild-type flies, Chd1 mutant flies were unable to maintain higher L. plantarum titres over time.

We tested this procedure on (a) a large wild-caught population and (b) 11 isofemale lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Compared to previous methods, this procedure reduces the environmental noise and allows for the analysis of large population samples. Consistent with previous results, we show that flies have a preference for orange vs. apple odor. With our procedure wild-derived flies exhibit olfactory learning in the absence of previous laboratory selection. Furthermore, we find genetic differences in the olfactory learning with relatively high heritability.

In insects, they can be released as neuromodulators within the central nervous system (CNS) or as neurohormones into the hemolymph. We analyzed the peptidome of neurohormonal release sites and associated secretory peptidergic neurons of adult Drosophila melanogaster. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analyzes were performed on single organs or cell cluster from individual flies. This first peptidomic characterization in adult fruit flies revealed 32 different neuropeptides. Peptides not directly predictable from previously cloned or annotated precursor genes were sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry. These peptides turned out to be either intermediate products of neuropeptide processing or shorter versions of known peptides. We found that the peptidome of the CNS-associated neurohemal organs is tagma-specific in Drosophila. Abdominal neurohemal organs and their supplying peptidergic neurons contain the capa gene products periviscerokinins and pyrokinin-1, thoracic neurohemal organs contain FMRFamides, and the neurohemal release sites of the brain contain pyrokinin-1(2-15), pyrokinin-2, corazonin, myosuppressin, and sNPF as their major putative release products.

The activity ofJH degradation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP, an enzyme regulating DA synthesis) were used as indicators of JH and DA levels, respectively. We demonstrated that, under normal conditions, the ubiquitous inhibition of the InR gene expression in D. melanogaster females induced an increase in the JH degradation and ALP activity. As we have already shown, this is indicative of the decrease in the concentration of the above hormones. It was also found that the total inactivation of InR does not affect the initiation ofJ H and DA metabolic system response to heat stress; however, it does affect its intensity. Thus, the involvement of the insulin signaling pathway in the regulation of the JH and DA metabolism in Drosophila females was demonstrated in vivo under normal and stress conditions.",2013,"E V Bogomolova, N V Adon'eva, E K Karpova, N E Gruntenko, I Yu Raushenbakh, E V Bogomolova, N V Adon'eva, E K Karpova, N E Gruntenko, I Yu Raushenbakh"
Concerted evolution within the Drosophila dumpy gene,17237523,10.1534/genetics.106.060897,"We have determined by reverse Southern analysis and direct sequence comparisons that most of the dumpy gene has evolved in the dipteran and other insect orders by purifying selection acting on amino acid replacements. One region, however, is evolving rapidly due to unequal crossing over and/or gene conversion. This region, called ""PIGSFEAST,"" or PF, encodes in D. melanogaster 30-47 repeats of 102 amino acids rich in serines, threonines, and prolines. We show that the processes of concerted evolution have been operating on all species of Drosophila examined to date, but that an adjacent region has expanded in Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti, and Tribolium castaneum, while the PF repeats are reduced in size and number. In addition, processes of concerted evolution have radically altered the codon usage patterns in D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, and D. virilis compared with the rest of the dumpy gene. We show also that the dumpy gene is expressed on the inner surface of the micropyle of the mature oocyte and propose that, as in the abalone system, concerted evolution may be involved in adaptive changes affecting Dumpy's possible role in sperm-egg recognition.",2007,"Amber Carmon, Marian Wilkin, Jana Hassan, Martin Baron, Ross MacIntyre, Amber Carmon, Marian Wilkin, Jana Hassan, Martin Baron, Ross MacIntyre"
Nucleotide sequence of the Xdh region in Drosophila pseudoobscura and an analysis of the evolution of synonymous codons,2493563,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040529,"The nucleotide sequence of the Xdh region of Drosophila pseudoobscura is presented. The Xdh gene structure and organization are compared with the homologous region in D. melanogaster. This locus is shown to have similar organization in the two species, although an additional intron and three insertion/deletion events are described for the D. pseudoobscura coding region. The encoded proteins are predicted to have very similar charges and hydrophobic/hydrophilic domains even though 11% of the amino acids are different. A gene 5' to Xdh, putative l(3)s12, is suggested from sequence similarity between the species. Synonymous differences at the Xdh locus between the two species are analyzed using a new method described in the preceding paper by Lewontin. This analysis shows that synonymous positions within the Xdh locus are evolving at very different rates, being dependent on level of codon redundancy. A comparison of synonymous divergence between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura in five additional genes reveals variation in the level of synonymous substitution.",1989,"M A Riley, M A Riley"
Role of adipokinetic hormone during starvation in Drosophila,30110658,10.1016/j.cbpb.2018.08.004,"The role of adipokinetic hormone (Drome-AKH) in maintaining the levels of basic nutrients, under starvation conditions, was studied using Drosophila melanogaster mutants with AKH deficiency (Akh1) and AKH abundance (EE-Akh). Our results showed lipids as the main energy reserve in Drosophila, and their physiological level and metabolism were shown to be under the control of AKH. AKH abundance in the body resulted in lower levels of triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols than in the controls, probably due to a more intensive metabolism; interestingly, there was a disproportional representation of fatty acids in triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols in Drosophila. Lower level of glycogen and its partial control by AKH suggest its lesser role as the storage substance. However, maintenance of free carbohydrate level in Drosophila seemed to be critical; when glycogen stores are exhausted, carbohydrates are synthesized from other sources. Protein levels and their alterations, under starvation, did not seem controlled by AKH. AKH-deficient flies were more resistant while AKH-abundant flies were more sensitive to starvation; females were found to be more resistant than males, regardless of the AKH level, probably due to higher body mass and higher amount of nutrients. However, in accordance with the level of all nutrients, that of AKH also gradually decreased with prolonged starvation.",2018,"Michaela Mochanová, Aleš Tomčala, Zdeňka Svobodová, Dalibor Kodrík, Michaela Mochanová, Aleš Tomčala, Zdeňka Svobodová, Dalibor Kodrík"
Drosophila melanogaster p24 trafficking proteins have vital roles in development and reproduction,22554671,10.1016/j.mod.2012.04.002,"p24 proteins comprise a family of type-I transmembrane proteins of ~24kD that are present in yeast and plants as well as metazoans ranging from Drosophila to humans. These proteins are most commonly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi interface and are incorporated in anterograde and retrograde transport vesicles. Little is known about how disruption of p24 signaling affects individual tissue function or whole animals. Drosophila melanogaster express nine p24 genes, grouped into four subfamilies. Based upon our mRNA and protein expression data, Drosophila p24 family members are expressed in a variety of tissues. To identify functions for particular Drosophila p24 proteins, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to reduce p24 expression. Ubiquitous reduction of most p24 genes resulted in complete or partial lethality during development. We found that reducing p24 levels in adults caused defects in female fecundity (egg laying) and also reduced male fertility. We attributed reduced female fecundity to decreased neural p24 expression. These results provide the first genetic analysis of all p24 family members in a multicellular animal and indicate vital roles for Drosophila p24s in development and reproduction, implicating neural expression of p24s in the regulation of female behavior.",2012,"Sehresh Saleem, Christoph C Schwedes, Lisa L Ellis, Stephanie T Grady, Rachel L Adams, Natalie Johnson, Julie R Whittington, Ginger E Carney, Sehresh Saleem, Christoph C Schwedes, Lisa L Ellis, Stephanie T Grady, Rachel L Adams, Natalie Johnson, Julie R Whittington, Ginger E Carney"
Transgenic analysis of the Smad family of TGF-beta signal transducers in Drosophila melanogaster suggests new roles and new interactions between family members,11290719,,"Smad signal transducers are required for transforming growth factor-beta-mediated developmental events in many organisms including humans. However, the roles of individual human Smad genes (hSmads) in development are largely unknown. Our hypothesis is that an hSmad performs developmental roles analogous to those of the most similar Drosophila Smad gene (dSmad). We expressed six hSmad and four dSmad transgenes in Drosophila melanogaster using the Gal4/UAS system and compared their phenotypes. Phylogenetically related human and Drosophila Smads induced similar phenotypes supporting the hypothesis. In contrast, two nearly identical hSmads generated distinct phenotypes. When expressed in wing imaginal disks, hSmad2 induced oversize wings while hSmad3 induced cell death. This observation suggests that a very small number of amino acid differences, between Smads in the same species, confer distinct developmental roles. Our observations also suggest new roles for the dSmads, Med and Dad, in dActivin signaling and potential interactions between these family members. Overall, the study demonstrates that transgenic methods in Drosophila can provide new information about non-Drosophila members of developmentally important multigene families.",2001,"R M Marquez, M A Singer, N T Takaesu, W R Waldrip, Y Kraytsberg, S J Newfeld, R M Marquez, M A Singer, N T Takaesu, W R Waldrip, Y Kraytsberg, S J Newfeld"
"Structure, function, and expression of Drosophila melanogaster FMRFamide-related peptides",10676454,10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb07897.x,"In 1977, Price and Greenberg identified the tetrapeptide FMRFamide as a cardioexcitatory molecule from mollusc. Subsequent to this discovery, FMRFamide-related peptides (FaRPs) have been identified in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Peptides in the FaRP family contain a common RFamide C-terminus and act as modulators and messengers of neural and gastrointestinal functions. Like other organisms, Drosophila melanogaster contains several genes that encode for numerous FaRPs. Elucidating the processing and activities of multiple FaRPs encoded in a single precursor is critical to establishing their roles in physiology. In this manuscript, we describe the distribution of FMRFamide immunoreactive materials in the Drosophila central nervous system and gut, and correlate it with the expression of specific FaRPs and their activities. The unique distributions and biological activities of Drosophila FaRPs suggest that the precursors are highly processed and the structurally related peptides are not functionally redundant. The complete distribution of FaRPs in the central nervous system and gut as detected by FMRFamide antisera is not accounted for by the sum of the individual expression patterns of the known Drosophila peptides. Thus, these data suggest that one or more Drosophila FaRPs or structurally related peptides remain to be discovered.",1999,"R Nichols, J B McCormick, I A Lim, R Nichols, J B McCormick, I A Lim"

Further, two-hybrid system analysis reveals DmUbc9 interaction with Drosophila and mammalian Hsp27. In situ hybridization localizes Dmubc9 as a doublet at locus 21D on chromosome 2L, and genomic cloning of the gene reveals a single open reading frame without introns. The predicted Dmubc9 protein sequence shares a very high level of homology with mouse (85.4%) and human (> or = 82.9%) Ubc9. Genetic complementation analysis show that Dmubc9 functionally rescues a temperature-sensitive S. cerevisiae ubc9ts mutant. Co-immunoprecipitation with antibody raised against DmUbc9 confirms the interaction with Drosophila Hsp23 and Hsp26 and preferentially with Hsp27. The DmUbc9 protein, which localizes primarily to the nucleus in Drosophila S2 cells, is found at high levels in embryos but is also present at lower levels throughout development.

The sequencing of three different genomic clones (A, B, and D) revealed that all the isolated Drosophila clones are similar to one another in a short region containing variable numbers of the GCN repeat. The genomic clone B was found to be the genomic counterpart of the cDNA clone E6. The other genomic clones, A and D, also hybridize with Drosophila cDNA clones at high stringency. These results indicate that the short GCN repetitive sequences, which we have named ala, are found within transcribed regions of the Drosophila genome.

Lack of response to family selection for directional asymmetry in Drosophila melanogaster: left and right are not distinguished in development,1978341,10.1098/rspb.1990.0078,"Family selection for directional asymmetry in the expression of the Drosophila melanogaster mutant scute had no result. Fluctuating asymmetry did not show a selection differential correlated with directional asymmetry. The unfolding of bilateral symmetry in embryogenesis can be used to explain the lack of genetic variation for directional asymmetry. Directional asymmetry provides a well-understood example of a developmental constraint in evolution. It is proposed that as no evidence is available for an independent left-right gradient in the embryo, quantitative traits can only be expressed variably along an existing gradient of positional information or a morphogen.",1990,"E J Tuinstra, G De Jong, W Scharloo, E J Tuinstra, G De Jong, W Scharloo"

Spindles and centrosomes during male meiosis in Drosophila melanogaster,2109698,,"We have studied the spatial distribution of chromosomes, spindle fibers and centrosomes throughout the first meiotic division in males of Drosophila melanogaster. There seem to be two different types of spindle fibers: those which connect the poles to the chromosomes, and others arranged as cup-shaped hemispheres that reach from the poles to an unstained area on the equator of the cell. These pole-equator fibers could be responsible for positioning the nucleus and distributing cytoplasmic organelles around the nucleus during prophase, so that after meiosis, the daughter cells are provided with equal amounts of preorganized cytoplasmic organelles. These fibers remain until after the daughter nuclei have formed during telophase. An antigen associated with the centrosomes of mitotic spindles appears during meiosis as dispersed particles surrounding the nucleus; these particles might provide the developing spermatids with microtubule-organizing centers.",1990,"J Casal, C González, P Ripoll, J Casal, C González, P Ripoll"
Analysis of dominance for competitive ability in Drosophila melanogaster,2509405,10.1038/hdy.1989.95,"In these experiments the genetic basis of larval competition in Drosophila melanogaster was investigated. Competitive ability was defined by a series of regression coefficients relating larval performance to their mono- and duo-culture densities. Sixteen inter-related F1 hybrids were individually compared with their parents, revealing the presence of large amounts of dominance and heterosis for the various competitive parameters, all directed towards improved competitive ability. Analysis of the F1 hybrids amongst themselves revealed that most of the heterosis was due to either interchromosomal interaction, or the complementing action of haploid autosomes and relatively little was due to any specific interaction between the homologues. The relevance of these results to the current understanding of heterosis is discussed.",1989,"J R de Miranda, P Eggleston, J R de Miranda, P Eggleston"

The route of infection determines Wolbachia antibacterial protection in Drosophila,28592678,10.1098/rspb.2017.0809,"Bacterial symbionts are widespread among metazoans and provide a range of beneficial functions.

However, no evidence for Wolbachia-mediated antibacterial protection has been demonstrated in Drosophila to date. Here, we show that the route of infection is key for Wolbachia-mediated antibacterial protection. Drosophila melanogaster carrying Wolbachia showed reduced mortality during enteric-but not systemic-infection with the opportunist pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosaWolbachia-mediated protection was more pronounced in male flies and is associated with increased early expression of the antimicrobial peptide Attacin A, and also increased expression of a reactive oxygen species detoxification gene (Gst D8). These results highlight that the route of infection is important for symbiont-mediated protection from infection, that Wolbachia can protect hosts by eliciting a combination of resistance and disease tolerance mechanisms, and that these effects are sexually dimorphic.

We used Drosophila melanogaster to study how mutations in key DNA repair genes affect an organism's response to chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, we focused on camptothecin and its derivatives, topotecan and irinotecan, which are type I topoisomerase inhibitors that create DNA double-strand breaks in rapidly dividing cells. Here, we describe two polymorphisms in Drosophila Cyp6d2 that result in extreme sensitivity to camptothecin but not topotecan or irinotecan. We confirmed that the sensitivity was due to mutations in Cyp6d2 by rescuing the defect with a wild-type copy of Cyp6d2. In addition, we showed that combining a cyp6d2 mutation with mutations in Drosophila brca2 results in extreme sensitivity to camptothecin. Given the frequency of the Cyp6d2 polymorphisms in publcly available Drosophila stocks, our study demonstrates the need for caution when interpreting results from drug sensitivity screens in Drosophila and other model organisms.

How the convergence of combinatorial inputs to principle neurons of associative brain regions is established during development is unknown. Here, we explore the developmental patterning of sparse olfactory inputs to Kenyon cells of the Drosophila melanogaster mushroom body. By manipulating the ratio between pre- and post-synaptic cells, we find that postsynaptic Kenyon cells set convergence ratio: Kenyon cells produce fixed distributions of dendritic claws while presynaptic processes are plastic. Moreover, we show that sparse odor responses are preserved in mushroom bodies with reduced cellular repertoires, suggesting that developmental specification of convergence ratio allows functional robustness.",2020,"Najia A Elkahlah, Jackson A Rogow, Maria Ahmed, E Josephine Clowney, Najia A Elkahlah, Jackson A Rogow, Maria Ahmed, E Josephine Clowney"
THE DETECTION OF GAMETIC DISEQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN ALLOZYME LOCI IN NATURAL POPULATIONS OF DROSOPHILA,28567756,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1992.tb01177.x,"The capacity of the usual tests (chi-square and related tests) to detect gametic disequilibrium between allozyme loci in natural populations of Drosophila has been investigated. We analyzed a large collection of previously reported gametic samples from natural populations involving a variety of loosely linked allozyme loci located along the O chromosome of Drosophila subobscura and the second chromosome of D. melanogaster. It is found that the statistical power of the individual tests to detect the sample disequilibria between allozyme loci is remarkably low, being the average (over pairs of loci) of power estimates close to 0.20 in both species. Moreover, the average minimum disequilibrium (D'min ) that would be required to reject (90% probability) the hypothesis of gametic equilibrium is higher than 0.50 given the observed degree of polymorphism and sample sizes used. This means that statistically significant associations between allozyme loci would rarely be detected by single-sample tests even when much disequilibrium is present in natural populations of Drosophila. However, an alternative approach based on the analysis of disquilibrium for large sets of gametic samples, combining probabilities from single independent tests and assessing significance by a bootstrap procedure, reveals that most of the locus pairs within segment I and II of the O chromosome of D. subobscura and left arm of the second chromosome of D. melanogaster present significant nonrandom associations. Within these chromosomal sections, the observed average absolute value of disquilibrium (D') between loci is around 0.25 (under the more conservative estimation). Also, a positive relationship between the magnitude of disequilibrium and linkage was detected. These findings suggest that weak or moderate values of disequilibrium between loosely linked allozyme loci are more frequent in natural populations of Drosophila than is currently believed.",1992,"C Zapata, G Alvarez, C Zapata, G Alvarez"

Reproductive Homeostasis and Senescence in Drosophila melanogaster,30521013,10.1093/gerona/gly274,"The homeostatic properties of reproduction in aging female Drosophila melanogaster are investigated. Classic studies based on cohort analysis suggest that homeostatic capacity declines gradually as daily oviposition rates decline in aging flies. Analysis at the level of individuals gives a very different picture: reproductive homeostasis remains relatively constant for most of adult life until a critical point when oviposition either ceases entirely or continues in dysregulated fashion. The collapse of homeostatic capacity is abrupt. Enhanced homeostasis is associated with increased lifetime fecundity and improved prospects for survival. The fractal concept of lacunarity can be used to parameterize the ""roughness"" of individual fecundity trajectories and is inversely related to homeostatic capacity.",2019,"James W Curtsinger, James W Curtsinger"

Mutation of the Adh gene of Drosophila melanogaster containing an internal tandem duplication,2419573,10.1016/0022-2836(85)90388-2,"AdhnLA248 is an X-ray-induced mutation of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene of Drosophila melanogaster that lacks detectable ADH protein but is transcribed. The transcript of this mutant allele is longer than that of the wild type. This is because the mutation is a duplication of parts of the second and third exons of Adh and of the intron that normally separates them. The primary transcript of the mutant allele is processed by the removal of both of the identical copies of intron 3. This mutation presumably originated, in the haploid sperm, as two staggered single-stranded breaks that gave rise to the duplication as a consequence of replication after fertilization.",1985,"W Chia, C Savakis, R Karp, H Pelham, M Ashburner, W Chia, C Savakis, R Karp, H Pelham, M Ashburner"

A large proportion of the kinetochores of In(1)sc4Lsc8R/Y bivalents did not face opposite poles during metaphase I and anaphase I. This suggests that In(1)sc4Lsc8R/Y bivalents may have difficulty achieving bipolar stability. Delay in achieving bipolar stability could contribute to the nondisjunctional behavior found in In(1)sc4Lsc8R/Y males.,1984,"J G Ault, H P Lin, J G Ault, H P Lin"

Ritsu: a rhythm mutant from a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster,7760214,10.3109/01677069509084160,"We found a new clock mutation, ritsu (rit), in an inbred strain separated from a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster in Yamaguchi, Japan. This mutation lengthens the free-running period of the wild-type locomotor activity rhythm from ca. 24 hr to ca. 27 hr by lengthening both active and rest phases equally. To determine the loci involved, we established eight lines of chromosomal substituted flies between the inbred strain and Canton-S, and found that a major gene is located on the second chromosome. Furthermore, the result of recombination analysis suggested that the locus might be near or to the left of cl (2-18.8).",1995,"T Murata, A Matsumoto, K Tomioka, Y Chiba, T Murata, A Matsumoto, K Tomioka, Y Chiba"
Extent of polytene in the pericentric heterochromatin of polytene chromosomes of pseudonurse cells of otu (ovarian tumor) mutants of Drosophila melanogaster,8355659,10.1007/BF00277066,"In the polytene nuclei of germ-line cells (ovarian pseudonurse cells) of Drosophila melanogaster females mutant for otu11 (ovarian tumor), the pericentric heterochromatin is much more abundant than in somatic salivary gland cells. This is due to the degree of heterochromatin compaction (and consequently the level of underreplication) being lower in the nurse cells than in the salivary gland cells. The lower level of compaction probably results in a very low degree of position effect gene inactivation in the ovarian nurse cells.",1993,"N I Mal'ceva, I F Zhimulev, N I Mal'ceva, I F Zhimulev"
Genetic polymorphism of prophenoloxidase A1 in Drosophila melanogaster,8251187,,"Electrophoretic variations of prophenoloxidase were obtained from natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. A1, one of the 2 isoforms of the prophenoloxidases, is polymorphic: 10 fast-migrating and 2 slow-migrating types were found in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis among 271 wild strains. The majority were the intermediate-migrating type. By use of these variants, A1 gene was mapped at 79.6 on the right arm of the second chromosome. By deletion mapping, its cytological position was located at 55A-B. In the electropherograms, hybrids between the types differing in mobility exhibited 3 bands, indicating that A1 is a dimeric protein. The gene for A1 is expressed through larval, pupal and adult stages.",1993,"N Asada, K Fujimoto, M Tanaka, E Ohnishi, N Asada, K Fujimoto, M Tanaka, E Ohnishi"

Both heterologous enzymes, which show respectively little and no sequence homology to the corresponding yeast enzymes, fully restored wild-type properties when their genes were expressed in yeast deletion mutants. This result does not support notions of an obligatory formation of glycolytic multi-enzyme aggregates in yeast; nor does it support possible regulatory functions of yeast phosphoglucose isomerase.",1993,"E Boles, F K Zimmermann, E Boles, F K Zimmermann"
Phenomenon of life span instability in Drosophila melanogaster: I.

Highly reliable variations in both fitness components were found. On initial inspection the variations would be characterized as random or irregular wherein mean values differed up to threefold. The variance in longevity is greater in females than in males. By use of mathematical procedures we have shown a scale regularity in LS distributions for all generations. Such regularity, in spite of considerable differences in absolute values (mean and maximum LS), suggested that the origin of LS instability is nonrandom.",1993,"D M Izmaylov, L K Obukhova, O V Okladnova, A P Akifyev, D M Izmaylov, L K Obukhova, O V Okladnova, A P Akifyev"

One of the components contains predominantly neutral sugars and a phenolic substance (S-fraction). The other contains predominantly amino acids, aminosugars and a phenolic substance.

Assuming that response is more related to the efficiency of utilising available resources and aggression to the ability to acquire those resources, we attempt to relate estimates of aggression and response obtained from a range of genotypes to estimates of larval feeding rates and conversion efficiencies. No significant correlations were found and we conclude that other characteristics must be involved in a more complex determination of competitive ability.",1988,"J R de Miranda, P Eggleston, J R de Miranda, P Eggleston"

Females were more fecund when male effects were present, and the largest increase was recorded when vials were previously conditioned by males. This effect was probably due to the growth of transmitted microorganisms, which were observed on the laying surface, as further experiments with vials conditioned by virgin females showed a similar increase in fecundity. A male-specific effect was isolated by conditioning bottles containing only agar with males and virgin females. The observation of a male factor that stimulates oviposition without mating is novel and suggests complicated fertility interactions between the sexes.",1985,"Ary A Hoffmann, Lawrence G Harshman, Ary A Hoffmann, Lawrence G Harshman"

This decrease does not appear to be caused by appearance of an inhibitor of peptide chain elongation. Instead, the synthesis of EF-1 declines markedly early in adult life. This decrease is followed by lowered activity of EF-1 and by a drop in the synthesis of most of the cellular proteins.",1983,"G C Webster, S L Webster, G C Webster, S L Webster"

For flies with four of the alleles, a base-line oscillation was also observed.

Clones of cells marked by means of X-ray-induced somatic crossing-over prior to early third instar participated in the formation of both antenna and homoeotic leg, but after this time, the clone was restricted to either antenna or homoeotic leg, indicating that determination occurs in the third larval instar.

Evolution of Drosophila mitochondrial DNAs. Comparison of denaturation maps,825147,10.1016/0005-2787(76)90351-8,"In an approach to the functional anatomy of the mitochondrial genome and its evolution, we have compared buoyant densities, contour lengths, and denaturation maps in circular mitochondrial DNAs of the genus Drosophila. Mitochondrial DNAs from three representatives of the subgenus Drosophila (D. virilis, D. hydei, D. funebris) are similar in size (approx. 5 mum or 1 - 10(7) daltons) and buoyant density (approx. 1.685 g/ml), while in two members of the subgenus Sophophora (D. melanogaster, D. simulans), mitochondrial DNAs are longer (approx. 6 mum or 12.4 - 10(6) daltons) and have a lower buoyant density (approx. 1.681 g/ml). The latter mitochondrial DNAs also share one distinctly large early melting region, which in D. melanogaster is equivalent to 1.54 mum of native DNA. The corresponding (A + T)-rich region in D. virilis or D. hydei mitochondrial DNA is 1 mum shorter. Except for this region, denaturation maps of D. melanogaster and D. virilis mitochondrial DNAs are indistinguishable. The addition or deletion of a single block of (A + T)-rich sequences can fully account for the differences in buoyant density and size between the mitochondrial DNAs we have examined. In an appendix, we show that there is an equivalent discrepancy between the extent of strand separation determined by electron by electron microscopy and the actual extent of DNA denaturation, whether this is determined from absorbance changes or inferred from the reduction in contour lengths of individual circular molecules. The reduction in contour length appears to result exclusively from the uniform foreshortening of single-stranded DNA, not only in regions of visible strand separation but also in denatured regions hidden within putatively native segments of molecules. For molecules showing 15--45% strand separation, we estimate that putatively native segments are approximately 50% denatured.",1976,"H Bultmann, R A Zakour, M A Sosland, H Bultmann, R A Zakour, M A Sosland"

Developmental control is then passed from mother to zygote through a process known as the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). The MZT comprises an intimately connected set of molecular events that mediate degradation of maternally deposited mRNAs and transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome. This essential developmental transition is conserved among metazoans but is perhaps best understood in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. In this article, we will review our understanding of the events that drive the MZT in Drosophila embryos and highlight parallel mechanisms driving this transition in other animals.",2018,"Danielle C Hamm, Melissa M Harrison, Danielle C Hamm, Melissa M Harrison"
Drosophila melanogaster as a model for basal body research,27382461,10.1186/s13630-016-0041-5,"The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is one of the most extensively studied organisms in biological research and has centrioles/basal bodies and cilia that can be modelled to investigate their functions in animals generally. Centrioles are nine-fold symmetrical microtubule-based cylindrical structures required to form centrosomes and also to nucleate the formation of cilia and flagella. When they function to template cilia, centrioles transition into basal bodies. The fruit fly has various types of basal bodies and cilia, which are needed for sensory neuron and sperm function. Genetics, cell biology and behaviour studies in the fruit fly have unveiled new basal body components and revealed different modes of assembly and functions of basal bodies that are conserved in many other organisms, including human, green algae and plasmodium. Here we describe the various basal bodies of Drosophila, what is known about their composition, structure and function.",2016,"Swadhin Chandra Jana, Mónica Bettencourt-Dias, Bénédicte Durand, Timothy L Megraw, Swadhin Chandra Jana, Mónica Bettencourt-Dias, Bénédicte Durand, Timothy L Megraw"
Choosing mates based on the diet of your ancestors: replication of non-genetic assortative mating in Drosophila melanogaster,26339551,10.7717/peerj.1173,"Assortative mating has been a focus of considerable research because of its potential to influence biodiversity at many scales. Sharon et al. (2010) discovered that an inbred strain of Drosophila melanogaster mated assortatively based on the diet of previous generations, leading to initial reproductive isolation without genetic evolution. This behavior was reproduced by manipulating the microbiome independently of the diet, pointing to extracellular bacterial symbionts as the assortative mating cue. To further investigate the biological significance of this result, we attempted to reproduce this phenomenon in an independent laboratory using different genotypes and additional mating assays. Supporting the previous result, we found that a different inbred strain also mated assortatively based on the diets of previous generations. However, we were unable to generate assortative mating in an outbred strain from North Carolina. Our results support the potential for non-genetic mechanisms to influence reproductive isolation, but additional work is needed to investigate the importance of this mechanism in natural populations of Drosophila.",2015,"Michael A Najarro, Matt Sumethasorn, Alexandra Lamoureux, Thomas L Turner, Michael A Najarro, Matt Sumethasorn, Alexandra Lamoureux, Thomas L Turner"
Role of α-synuclein in cognitive dysfunction: Studies in Drosophila melanogaster,25954925,10.3892/mmr.2015.3763,"α-Synuclein (α-Syn) is hypothesized to have a critical role in sporadic and genetic cases of Parkinson's disease (PD) in which Lewy bodies, as the hallmark of PD, are formed from abnormal aggregates of α-Syn. To determine the role of α-Syn in the motor and cognitive dysfunction observed in PD, a Drosophila melanogaster model was established to investigate the electrophysiological and ethological changes caused by overexpression of α-Syn. The present data indicated that α-Syn overexpression reduced the synaptic transmission of cholinergic neurons by modulating the calcium channel currents in the projection neurons in the antennal lobe region of the Drosophila brain, as well as the learning and memory ability of the flies. However, the locomotor ability of the Drosophila remained unaffected.

Genes for iron metabolism influence circadian rhythms in Drosophila melanogaster,22885802,10.1039/c2mt20065a,"Haem has been previously implicated in the function of the circadian clock, but whether iron homeostasis is integrated with circadian rhythms is unknown. Here we describe an RNA interference (RNAi) screen using clock neurons of Drosophila melanogaster. RNAi is targeted to iron metabolism genes, including those involved in haem biosynthesis and degradation. The results indicate that Ferritin 2 Light Chain Homologue (Fer2LCH) is required for the circadian activity of flies kept in constant darkness. Oscillations of the core components in the molecular clock, PER and TIM, were also disrupted following Fer2LCH silencing. Other genes with a putative function in circadian biology include Transferrin-3, CG1358 (which has homology to the FLVCR haem export protein) and five genes implicated in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis: the Drosophila homologues of IscS (CG12264), IscU (CG9836), IscA1 (CG8198), Iba57 (CG8043) and Nubp2 (CG4858).

TEs contribute to genetic diversity by their mutational potential as a result of their ability to insert into genes or gene regulator regions, to promote chromosomal rearrangements, and to interfere with gene networks. Also, TEs may be activated by environmental stresses (such as temperature or radiation) that interfere with epigenetic regulation systems, and makes them powerful mutation agents in nature. To understand the relationship between genotype and phenotype, we need to analyze the portions of the genome corresponding to TEs in great detail, and to decipher their relationships with the genes. For this purpose, we carried out comparative analyses of various natural populations of the closely-related species Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, which differ with regard to their TE amounts as well as their ecology and population size.",2012,"Cristina Vieira, Marie Fablet, Emmanuelle Lerat, Matthieu Boulesteix, Rita Rebollo, Nelly Burlet, Abdou Akkouche, Benjamin Hubert, Hussein Mortada, Christian Biémont, Cristina Vieira, Marie Fablet, Emmanuelle Lerat, Matthieu Boulesteix, Rita Rebollo, Nelly Burlet, Abdou Akkouche, Benjamin Hubert, Hussein Mortada, Christian Biémont"
Antagonistic selection between adult thorax and wing size in field released Drosophila melanogaster independent of thermal conditions,17887974,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01422.x,"Attempts to explain size variation in Drosophila and other small insects often focus on the larval stage and association between development time and size, but patterns are also influenced by direct selection on size-related traits in the adults. Here we use multiple field releases of Drosophila melanogaster to test the association between size and one component of field fitness, the ability of Drosophila to locate resources for feeding and breeding. We find antagonistic selection between wing length and thorax length in both males and females, such that capture at baits is higher for flies with relatively larger thorax lengths and smaller wings. However flies with large wings relative to thoraces disperse further as reflected in the longer distances moved to baits. These patterns did not depend strongly on weather conditions, suggesting that selection on adult size is at least partly independent of temperature. Antagonistic selection between size traits can generate changes in size along gradients if the distribution of resources in the environment varies and selects for different dispersal patterns, particularly as dispersal is relatively higher under warmer conditions.",2007,"A A Hoffmann, E Ratna, C M Sgrò, M Barton, M Blacket, R Hallas, S De Garis, A R Weeks, A A Hoffmann, E Ratna, C M Sgrò, M Barton, M Blacket, R Hallas, S De Garis, A R Weeks"
Evolutionary change of codon usage for the histone gene family in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila hydei,10837157,10.1006/mpev.1999.0749,"The nucleotide divergence in the protein-coding region for replication-dependent and replication-independent histone 3 and 4 genes of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila hydei occurred mostly at the synonymous site. Therefore, the pattern of codon usage was analyzed in the two species, considering the genomic codon bias, which is proposed for estimating the genomic composition pressure in the protein-coding regions. The results indicated that the codon usage in the histone gene family could be explained mostly by the genomic codon bias. However, biases for Ala and Arg were commonly observed for the histone 3 and histone 4 gene families, and biases for Ser, Leu, and Glu were observed in a gene-specific manner. This suggests that both genomic codon bias and gene- or codon-specific bias are responsible for the nucleotide differentiation in the protein-coding region of the histone genes.",2000,"Y Matsuo, Y Matsuo"
Localized expression of a novel micropia-like element in the blastoderm of Drosophila melanogaster is dependent on the anterior morphogen bicoid,8055714,10.1007/BF00352316,"We have identified a novel transposon-like element of Drosophila melanogaster that is present in approximately 20 copies in the genome. It codes for a polyprotein containing the diagnostic sequence motifs for a nucleic acid binding CCHC protein, a proteinase, a reverse transcriptase and an integrase as typically found in retroviruses. Owing to its early expression in the blastoderm embryo, and its close relationship to micropia, a previously identified Drosophila retrotransposon, we termed the novel element ""blastopia"". The spatially restricted expression of blastopia transcripts in head anlagen of the blastoderm embryo is under the direct or indirect control of the Drosophila morphogen bicoid, which is normally required to establish the anterior pattern elements in the embryo.

Behavioral plasticity in response to internal or external cues of infection can therefore generate potentially significant heterogeneity in infection. We tested whether Drosophila melanogaster exhibits infection avoidance behavior, and whether this behavior is modified by prior exposure to Drosophila C Virus (DCV) and by the risk of DCV encounter. We examined 2 measures of infection avoidance: (1) the motivation to seek out food sources in the presence of an infection risk and (2) the preference to land on a clean food source over a potentially infectious source. While we found no evidence for preference of clean food sources over potentially infectious ones, previously exposed female flies showed lower motivation to pick a food source when presented with a risk of encountering DCV. We discuss the relevance of behavioral plasticity during foraging for host fitness and pathogen spread.",2017,"Pedro F Vale, Michael D Jardine, Pedro F Vale, Michael D Jardine"

Histamine is a major mechanosensory neurotransmitter candidate in Drosophila melanogaster,8103421,10.1007/BF00304618,"Histamine is known to be the neurotransmitter of insect photoreceptors.

The histamine-like staining includes the cell bodies of these neurons as well as their axons, which form prominent fibre bundles in peripheral nerves, and their terminal projections in the central neuropil of head and thoracic ganglia. The specificity of the immunostaining is demonstrated by investigating a Drosophila mutant unable to synthesize histamine. Other mechanosensory organs, such as campaniform sensilla or scolopidial organs, do not stain. In the calypteran flies, Musca and Calliphora, we find no comparable immunoreactivity associated with either hair sensilla or the nerves entering the central nervous system, observations in agreement with earlier studies on Calliphora.

Here, we explore how the Drosophila erecta even-skipped (eve) locus has evolved by testing its activity in the divergent D. melanogaster genome. We found, as has been reported previously, that the D. erecta eve stripe 2 enhancer (eveS2) fails to drive appreciable expression in D. melanogaster However, we found that a large transgene carrying the entire D. erecta eve locus drives normal eve expression, including in stripe 2.

The Context of Chemical Communication Driving a Mutualism,26392279,10.1007/s10886-015-0629-z,"Recent work suggests that Drosophila and Saccharomyces yeasts may establish a mutualistic association, and that this is driven by chemical communication. While individual volatiles have been implicated in the attraction of D. melanogaster, the semiochemicals affecting the behavior of the sibling species D. simulans are less well characterized. Here, we scrutinized a broad range of volatiles produced by attractive and repulsive yeasts to experimentally evaluate the chemical nature of communication between these species. When grown in liquid or on agar-solidified grape juice, attraction to S. cerevisiae was driven primarily by 3-methylbutyl acetate (isoamyl acetate) and repulsion by acetic acid, a known attractant to D. melanogaster (also known as vinegar fly). By using T-maze choice tests and synthetic compounds, we showed that these responses are strongly influenced by compound concentration. Moreover, the behavioral response is impacted further by the chemical context of the environment. Thus, chemical communication between yeasts and flies is complex, and is not driven simply by the presence of single volatiles, but modulated by compound interactions. The ecological context of chemical communication needs to be taken into consideration when testing for ecologically realistic responses.",2015,"Catrin S Günther, Matthew R Goddard, Richard D Newcomb, Claudia C Buser, Catrin S Günther, Matthew R Goddard, Richard D Newcomb, Claudia C Buser"
Coexistence of three different Drosophila species by rescheduling their life history traits in a natural population,16385160,10.1007/BF02715798,"We present evidence for coexistence of three different Drosophila species by rescheduling their life history traits in a natural population using the same resource, at the same time and same place. D. ananassae has faster larval development time (DT) and faster DT(egg-fly) than other two species thus utilizing the resources at maximum at both larval and adult stages respectively. Therefore, D. ananassae skips the interspecific competition at pre-adult stage but suffers more from intraspecific competition. However, D. melanogaster and D. biarmipes have rescheduled their various life history traits to avoid interspecific competition. Differences of ranks tests for various life history traits suggest that except for DT(egg-pupa), the difference of ranks is highest for the combination of D. melanogaster and D. ananassae for all other life history traits. This difference is maintained by tradeoffs between larval development time and pupal period and between pupal period and DT(egg-pupa) in D. ananassae.",2005,"Jay P Yadav, Bashisth N Singh, Jay P Yadav, Bashisth N Singh"
"Location of Shfr, a new gene that rescues hybrid female viability in crosses between Drosophila simulans females and D. melanogaster males",10886378,10.1046/j.1365-2540.2000.00658.x,"As a rule, progeny of crosses between Drosophila simulans females and D. melanogaster males are formed by sterile males, because females die as embryos. However, populations of these species have been found that produce a certain frequency of viable hybrid females. We have found that 94% of the females of a D. simulans population from Tel Aviv gave hybrid progenies with both sexes. The segregation of phenotypes with different rescue success adjusts to the action of a single, dominant, zygotic-acting gene involved in hybrid female viability. This gene, which we named 'Simulans hybrid females rescue' (Shfr), is temperature-sensitive, showing a much smaller effect as temperature increases. Reciprocal crosses between Tel Aviv and a nonrescue population indicate some influence of cytoplasm or maternal effect in rescue. Using a chromosome substitution analysis we have located Shfr on the second chromosome. Using synthetic lines with this chromosome having different segments from Tel Aviv and from a multimarker strain we have mapped Shfr between black (2 L-43. 0) and pearly (2 R-74.0).",2000,"M C Carracedo, A Asenjo, P Casares, M C Carracedo, A Asenjo, P Casares"
The relationship between structural variation and dysgenic properties of P elements in long-established P-transformed lines of Drosophila simulans,8682694,10.1038/hdy.1996.102,"Ten lines of Drosophila simulans were investigated with respect to P activity, P susceptibility and the number and structure of their P copies, eight years after transformation with the P element. All 10 were found to have reached a steady state. They exhibited varying levels of P activity (from 0 per cent to 96 per cent GD sterility) and, with the exception of one line, were not P-susceptible. In contrast with P element behaviour in D. melanogaster: (i) no relationship was found between the molecular pattern of P copies in a line and its ability to induce or to repress P expression in D. simulans; (ii) peculiar P element derivatives were observed in this species; (iii) the average number of P copies per genome was only half of that in D. melanogaster.

New horizons in genome engineering of Drosophila melanogaster,24817756,10.1266/ggs.89.3,"Drosophila melanogaster has the longest history as a genetic model system and even in the present day remains the front runner in diverse fields of biology. However, lack of a convenient method to make specified modifications to endogenous genes has been a pain in the neck for many fly geneticists for decades. Synthetic nuclease technologies, especially the CRISPR/Cas9 system, hold great promise for a breakthrough. Synthetic nucleases are programmable nucleases that can be directed to cleave a specified sequence in the genome. Deleterious mutations can be efficiently induced by expression of a synthetic nuclease that targets a gene of interest. Precise modification of the target site, such as a reporter gene knock-in, is also possible by simultaneous delivery of a synthetic nuclease and a targeting vector.

Does phenotypic plasticity for adult size versus food level in Drosophila melanogaster evolve in response to adaptation to different rearing densities?,22220880,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01427.x,"Recent studies with Drosophila have suggested that there is extensive genetic variability for phenotypic plasticity of body size versus food level. If true, we expect that the outcome of evolution at very different food levels should yield genotypes whose adult size show different patterns of phenotypic plasticity. We have tested this prediction with six independent populations of Drosophila melanogaster kept at extreme densities for 125 generations. We found that the phenotypic plasticity of body size versus food level is not affected by selection or the presence of competitors of a different genotype. However, we document increasing among population variation in phenotypic plasticity due to random genetic drift. Several reasons are explored to explain these results including the possibility that the use of highly inbred lines to make inferences about the evolution of genetically variable populations may be misleading.",2012,"Laurence D Mueller, Larry G Cabral, Laurence D Mueller, Larry G Cabral"

Meiotic recombination is suppressed near the histone-defined border of euchromatin and heterochromatin on chromosome 2L of Drosophila melanogaster,27031007,10.1139/gen-2015-0171,"In Drosophila melanogaster, the borders between pericentric heterochromatin and euchromatin on the major chromosome arms have been defined in various ways, including chromatin-specific histone modifications, the binding patterns of heterochromatin-enriched chromosomal proteins, and various cytogenetic techniques. Elucidation of the genetic properties that independently define the different chromatin states associated with heterochromatin and euchromatin should help refine the boundary. Since meiotic recombination is present in euchromatin, but absent in heterochromatin, it constitutes a key genetic property that can be observed transitioning between chromatin states.

Genetic and biochemical tools for investigating sirtuin function in Drosophila melanogaster,24014399,10.1007/978-1-62703-637-5_4,"Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most widely used genetic model systems in biology. The ease of working in an invertebrate model system allows the design and execution of many experiments that would be infeasible in a vertebrate model. Although the strength of the fly as a model system lies primarily in the ease of genetic manipulation, it is flexible enough that biochemical and proteomic approaches can also be used to build a more comprehensive study. Here we present a pair of complementary protocols that we have used to examine sirtuin biology in Drosophila. First, we describe our protocol for measuring lifespan in flies expressing a gene of interest under the inducible control of the Gene-Switch system.

In order to understand chromosomal organization, we set out to study the role of proteins that are selective for interbands. Here we describe the Drosophila melanogaster chromodomain protein Chriz that is coimmunoprecipitated with the zinc finger protein Z4. Both proteins colocalize exclusively to the interbands on Drosophila polytene chromosomes. Like Z4, Chriz is ubiquitously expressed throughout development and is associated with chromatin in all interphase nuclei. Following dissociation from chromatin, early in mitosis Chriz binds to the centrosomes and to the mitotic spindle. Newly induced amorphic Chriz alleles are early lethal, and ubiquitous overexpression of Chriz is lethal as well. Available Chriz hypomorphs which survive until pupal stage have a normal chromosomal phenotype. Reducing Z4 protein does not affect Chriz binding to polytene chromosomes and vice versa.

Sequences within the YAC clone are conserved in the centromeric region of the sibling species Drosophila simulans.

These features are extraordinarily similar to those associated with chromosome misbehavior in Drosophila melanogaster females. Furthermore, these organisms also share a significant level of achiasmate chromosome nondisjunction. Here we describe in detail the processes of achiasmate chromosome segregation in Drosophila and discuss how they may be most effectively applied to our understanding of the etiology of human aneuploidy. In particular, we examine the possibility that similar ""backup"" mechanisms of chromosome segregation might function in mammalian meiosis, particularly mammalian females.

Genetic basis of tolerance to O2 deprivation in Drosophila melanogaster,9380715,10.1073/pnas.94.20.10809,"The ability to tolerate a low-O2 environment varies widely among species in the animal kingdom. Some animals, such as Drosophila melanogaster, can tolerate anoxia for prolonged periods without apparent tissue injury. To determine the genetic basis of the cellular responses to low O2, we performed a genetic screen in Drosophila to identify loci that are responsible for anoxia resistance. Four X-linked, anoxia-sensitive mutants belonging to three complementation groups were isolated after screening more than 10,000 mutagenized flies. The identified recessive and dominant mutations showed marked delay in recovery from O2 deprivation. In addition, electrophysiologic studies demonstrated that polysynaptic transmission in the central nervous system of the mutant flies was abnormally long during recovery from anoxia.

The properties of the accessory-gland lipase were investigated, and pH optima and substrate utilization suggest that it has some similarities to vertebrate bile-salt-stimulated lipase. Lipase activity is significantly reduced in males and increased in females shortly after mating. This finding suggests that lipase activity is transferred to the female and may be important in mating and reproduction in Drosophila.",1994,"G M Smith, K Rothwell, S L Wood, S J Yeaman, M Bownes, G M Smith, K Rothwell, S L Wood, S J Yeaman, M Bownes"
Inbreeding depression and male-mating behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,8375666,10.1007/BF02424449,"There have been relatively few studies designed to investigate the effects of inbreeding on behavioral traits.

All lines showed significant reductions in overall mating ability, and males from all of these lines displayed impaired mating behavior, with two lines displaying particularly aberrant courtship patterns. Line 16 displayed an inability to successfully initiate copulation following successful courtship, while line 17 displayed significant reduction in locomotor activity, resulting in virtually no successful courtship or copulatory activity. The implications of these findings for competitive mating ability in wild Drosophila populations are presented.

Comparative transcriptomics reveals CrebA as a novel regulator of infection tolerance in D. melanogaster,29394281,10.1371/journal.ppat.1006847,"Host responses to infection encompass many processes in addition to activation of the immune system, including metabolic adaptations, stress responses, tissue repair, and other reactions. The response to bacterial infection in Drosophila melanogaster has been classically described in studies that focused on the immune response elicited by a small set of largely avirulent microbes. Thus, we have surprisingly limited knowledge of responses to infection that are outside the canonical immune response, of how the response to pathogenic infection differs from that to avirulent bacteria, or even of how generic the response to various microbes is and what regulates that core response. In this study, we addressed these questions by profiling the D. melanogaster transcriptomic response to 10 bacteria that span the spectrum of virulence. We found that each bacterium triggers a unique transcriptional response, with distinct genes making up to one third of the response elicited by highly virulent bacteria. We also identified a core set of 252 genes that are differentially expressed in response to the majority of bacteria tested. Among these, we determined that the transcription factor CrebA is a novel regulator of infection tolerance. Knock-down of CrebA significantly increased mortality from microbial infection without any concomitant change in bacterial number. Upon infection, CrebA is upregulated by both the Toll and Imd pathways in the fat body, where it is required to induce the expression of secretory pathway genes. Loss of CrebA during infection triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activated the unfolded protein response (UPR), which contributed to infection-induced mortality. Altogether, our study reveals essential features of the response to bacterial infection and elucidates the function of a novel regulator of infection tolerance.",2018,"Katia Troha, Joo Hyun Im, Jonathan Revah, Brian P Lazzaro, Nicolas Buchon, Katia Troha, Joo Hyun Im, Jonathan Revah, Brian P Lazzaro, Nicolas Buchon"
The silkworm glutathione S-transferase gene noppera-bo is required for ecdysteroid biosynthesis and larval development,25881968,10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.04.001,"Insect molting and metamorphosis are tightly controlled by ecdysteroids, which are important steroid hormones that are synthesized from dietary sterols in the prothoracic gland. One of the ecdysteroidogenic genes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is noppera-bo (nobo), also known as GSTe14, which encodes a member of the epsilon class of glutathione S-transferases. In D. melanogaster, nobo plays a crucial role in utilizing cholesterol via regulating its transport and/or metabolism in the prothoracic gland. However, it is still not known whether the orthologs of nobo from other insects are also involved in ecdysteroid biosynthesis via cholesterol transport and/or metabolism in the prothoracic gland. Here we report genetic evidence showing that the silkworm Bombyx mori ortholog of nobo (nobo-Bm; GSTe7) is essential for silkworm development. nobo-Bm is predominantly expressed in the prothoracic gland. To assess the functional importance of nobo-Bm, we generated a B. mori genetic mutant of nobo-Bm using TALEN-mediated genome editing. We show that loss of nobo-Bm function causes larval arrest and a glossy cuticle phenotype, which are rescued by the application of 20-hydroxyecdysone. Moreover, the prothoracic gland cells isolated from the nobo-Bm mutant exhibit an abnormal accumulation of 7-dehydrocholesterol, a cholesterol metabolite. These results suggest that the nobo family of glutathione S-transferases is essential for development and for the regulation of sterol utilization in the prothoracic gland in not only the Diptera but also the Lepidoptera. On the other hand, loss of nobo function mutants of D. melanogaster and B. mori abnormally accumulates different sterols, implying that the sterol utilization in the PG is somewhat different between these two insect species.",2015,"Sora Enya, Takaaki Daimon, Fumihiko Igarashi, Hiroshi Kataoka, Miwa Uchibori, Hideki Sezutsu, Tetsuro Shinoda, Ryusuke Niwa, Sora Enya, Takaaki Daimon, Fumihiko Igarashi, Hiroshi Kataoka, Miwa Uchibori, Hideki Sezutsu, Tetsuro Shinoda, Ryusuke Niwa"

Despite its importance we know remarkably little about the proximate (developmental) factors that determine body size under different circumstances. Here, I review what is known about how cell size and number contribute to phenetic and genetic variation in body size in Drosophila melanogaster, several fish, and fruits and leaves of some angiosperms. Variation in resources influences size primarily through changes in cell number while temperature acts through cell size. The difference in cellular mechanism may also explain the differences in growth trajectories resulting from food and temperature manipulations. There is, however, a poorly recognized interaction between food and temperature effects that needs further study. In addition, flies show a sexual dimorphism in temperature effects with the larger sex responding by changes in cell size and the smaller sex showing changes in both cell size and number. Leaf size is more variable than other organs, but there appears to be a consistent difference between how shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant species respond to light level. The former have larger leaves via cell size under shade, the latter via cell number in light conditions. Genetic differences, primarily from comparisons of D. melanogaster, show similar variation. Direct selection on body size alters cell number only, while temperature selection results in increased cell size and decreased cell number. Population comparisons along latitudinal clines show that larger flies have both larger cells and more cells. Use of these proximate patterns can give clues as to how selection acts in the wild. For example, the latitudinal pattern in D. melanogaster is usually assumed to be due to temperature, but the cellular pattern does not match that seen in laboratory selection at different temperatures.",2007,"Jeff Arendt, Jeff Arendt"

Sequencing of 80 clones identified 49 unique gene products, including a member of the Odorant Binding Protein family (Aaeg-OBP10), a homologue of Takeout (Aaeg-TO), and transposable elements of the LINE, SINE and MITE classes. Aaeg-OBP10 encodes a 140 amino acid protein including a predicted 25 amino acid signal peptide. Aaeg-OBP10 expression was adult male enriched, increased with adult age, and greatest in antennae and wings but also present in maxillary palps, proboscis and leg. Aaeg-OBP10 is a likely orthologue of Agam-OBP10 of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae and shares significant similarity with members of the OBP56 gene cluster of Drosophila melanogaster. These OBP genes may represent a unified class of OBPs with unique roles in chemodetection; the expression pattern of Aaeg-OBP10 suggests it may play a role in adult male chemosensory behavior.

Usp14 is required for spermatogenesis and ubiquitin stress responses in Drosophila melanogaster,31974276,10.1242/jcs.237511,"Deubiquitylating (DUB) enzymes free covalently linked ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitin-ubiquitin and ubiquitin-protein conjugates, and thereby maintain the equilibrium between free and conjugated ubiquitin moieties and regulate ubiquitin-mediated cellular processes. Here, we performed genetic analyses of mutant phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster and demonstrate that loss of Usp14 function results in male sterility, with defects in spermatid individualization and reduced testicular free monoubiquitin levels. These phenotypes were rescued by germline-specific overexpression of wild-type Usp14. Synergistic genetic interactions with Ubi-p63E and cycloheximide sensitivity suggest that ubiquitin shortage is a primary cause of male sterility. In addition, Usp14 is predominantly expressed in testes in Drosophila, indicating a higher demand for this DUB in testes that is also reflected by testis-specific loss-of-function Usp14 phenotypes. Collectively, these results suggest a major role of Usp14 in maintaining normal steady state free monoubiquitin levels during the later stages of Drosophila spermatogenesis.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",2020,"Levente Kovács, Ágota Nagy, Margit Pál, Peter Deák, Levente Kovács, Ágota Nagy, Margit Pál, Peter Deák"
NOMPC is likely a key component of Drosophila mechanotransduction channels,23590241,10.1111/ejn.12214,"Mechanotransduction is the basis of several sensory modalities, including touch, hearing, proprioception and gravity sensation. Despite its importance to sensory processing and behavior, the molecular mechanisms underlying mechanotransduction remain to be fully understood. In particular, the identity of the ion channels serving mechanotransduction is still unknown in many species. Drosophila melanogaster nompC (no mechanoreceptor potential C) has been shown to be essential for mechanotransduction in flies, yet there is no direct evidence demonstrating that NOMPC is indeed a mechanotransducing ion channel in Drosophila. To dissect the functional roles of NOMPC in mechanotransduction, we found that NOMPC-dependent transient adapting mechanoreceptor current (MRC) in the external bristle sensory organ was also chloride dependent. However, this chloride-dependent current was not necessary for spike generation. Furthermore, ectopic expression of wild-type NOMPC conferred mechanosensitivity on the interneurons in the antennal lobe (AL) and cation-mediated inward mechanocurrent was recorded, while a point mutation in the putative selective filter region of NOMPC failed to produce the mechanocurrent in the AL interneurons. These functional studies imply that NOMPC is likely to be a crucial component of mechanotransducers that accounts for mechanotransductions in mechanosensory neurons of Drosophila.",2013,"Jiaxin Gong, Qingxiu Wang, Zuoren Wang, Jiaxin Gong, Qingxiu Wang, Zuoren Wang"
Detection of volatile indicators of illicit substances by the olfactory receptors of Drosophila melanogaster,20530374,10.1093/chemse/bjq050,"Insects can detect a large range of odors with a numerically simple olfactory system that delivers high sensitivity and accurate discrimination. Therefore, insect olfactory receptors hold great promise as biosensors for detection of volatile organic chemicals in a range of applications. The array of olfactory receptor neurons of Drosophila melanogaster is rapidly becoming the best-characterized natural nose. We have investigated the suitability of Drosophila receptors as detectors for volatiles with applications in law enforcement, emergency response, and security. We first characterized responses of the majority of olfactory neuron types to a set of diagnostic odorants. Being thus able to correctly identify neurons, we then screened for responses from 38 different types of neurons to 35 agents. We identified 13 neuron types with responses to 13 agents. As individual Drosophila receptor genes have been mapped to neuron types, we can infer which genes confer responsiveness to the neurons. The responses were confirmed for one receptor by expressing it in a nonresponsive neuron. The fly olfactory system is mainly adapted to detect volatiles from fermenting fruits. However, our findings establish that volatiles associated with illicit substances, many of which are of nonnatural origin, are also detected by Drosophila receptors.",2010,"Brenton Marshall, Coral G Warr, Marien de Bruyne, Brenton Marshall, Coral G Warr, Marien de Bruyne"

Comprehensive functional analysis of family members is facilitated by access to a robust, stable and inducible expression system in a fly cell line. Here we show how the Schneider S2 cell line, derived from the Drosophila embryo, provides such an expression system, with the bonus that radioligand binding studies, second messenger assays, ion imaging, patch-clamp electrophysiology and gene silencing can readily be applied. Drosophila is also ideal for the study of new control strategies for insect pests since the receptors and ion channels that many new animal health drugs and crop protection chemicals target can be expressed in this cell line. In addition, many useful orthologues of human disease genes are emerging from the Drosophila genome and the study of their functions and interactions is another area for postgenome applications of S2 cell lines.",2002,"Paula R Towers, David B Sattelle, Paula R Towers, David B Sattelle"
Biochemical characterization of related microtubule proteins in Drosophila melanogaster and adult rat brain,8925297,10.1016/0006-8993(95)00952-8,"We describe the biochemical characteristics of three proteins isolated from Drosophila embryos and the rat brain. We refer to these proteins as DMAPs (Drosophila microtubule-associated proteins) since they were identified by monoclonal antibodies generated against microtubule protein (MTP) purified from Drosophila melanogaster embryos. DMAP-45 is a 45 kDa protein that binds microtubules in an ATP dependent manner. Preliminary biochemical evidence suggests that DMAP-45 may be an actin-related protein. DMAP-55 is a 55 kDa protein and based on its molecular weight and isoelectric point, may be a novel isoform of tubulin. DMAP-66 is a 66 kDa protein that binds strongly to microtubules in vitro and has multiple isoforms. Analyses of proteins in rat brain tissue extracts and purified rat brain MTP identified proteins of similar molecular weight and isoelectric points and are designated DMAP-45R, -55R and -66R. The presence of proteins with common biochemical properties in these widely divergent animal species suggests that they are related proteins.",1995,"S Srinivasan, T L Karr, S Srinivasan, T L Karr"
DNA sequence variation at the period locus within and among species of the Drosophila melanogaster complex,8436278,,"A 1.9-kilobase region of the period locus was sequenced in six individuals of Drosophila melanogaster and from six individuals of each of three sibling species: Drosophila simulans, Drosophila sechellia and Drosophila mauritiana. Extensive genealogical analysis of 174 polymorphic sites reveals a complex history. It appears that D. simulans, as a large population still segregating very old lineages, gave rise to the island species D. mauritiana and D. sechellia. Rather than considering these speciation events as having produced ""sister"" taxa, it seems more appropriate to consider D. simulans a parent species to D. sechellia and D. mauritiana. The order, in time, of these two phylogenetic events remains unclear. D. mauritiana supports a large number of polymorphisms, many of which are shared with D. simulans, and so appears to have begun and persisted as a large population. In contrast, D. sechellia has very little variation and seems to have experienced a severe population bottleneck. Alternatively, the low variation in D. sechellia could be due to recent directional selection and genetic hitchhiking at or near the per locus.",1993,"R M Kliman, J Hey, R M Kliman, J Hey"

Acid sensing by sweet and bitter taste neurons in Drosophila melanogaster,23783889,10.1038/ncomms3042,"Drosophila melanogaster can taste various compounds and separate them into few basic categories such as sweet, bitter and salt taste. Here we investigate mechanisms underlying acid detection in Drosophila and report that the fly displays strong taste aversion to common carboxylic acids. We find that acid tastants act by the activation of a subset of bitter neurons and inhibition of sweet neurons. Bitter neurons begin to respond at pH 5 and show an increase in spike frequency as the extracellular pH drops, which does not rely on previously identified chemoreceptors. Notably, sweet neuron activity depends on the balance of sugar and acid tastant concentrations. This is independent of bitter neuron firing, and allows the fly to avoid acid-laced food sources even in the absence of functional bitter neurons. The two mechanisms may allow the fly to better evaluate the risk of ingesting acidic foods and modulate its feeding decisions accordingly.",2013,"Sandhya Charlu, Zev Wisotsky, Adriana Medina, Anupama Dahanukar, Sandhya Charlu, Zev Wisotsky, Adriana Medina, Anupama Dahanukar"

Wildtype flies can be trained to successively avoid alternating sides in a reversal conditioning experiment. Every single fly shows strong avoidance and a positive memory score. The new conditioning apparatus has several advantages: (1) Statistically significant learning scores can be obtained for individual flies.

Therefore the apparatus is suitable for largescale mutant screening.

Since yeast and sugars are important nutritional pillars for Drosophila, availability of these foods should inform female reproductive behaviours. Yet mechanisms coupling food and sex are poorly understood. Here we show that yeast increases female sexual receptivity through interaction between its protein content and its odorous fermentation product acetic acid, sensed by the Ionotropic odorant receptor neuron Ir75a. A similar interaction between nutritional and hedonic value applies to sugars where taste and caloric value only increase sexual receptivity when combined. Integration of nutritional and sensory values would ensure that there are sufficient internal nutrients for egg production as well as sufficient environmental nutrients for offspring survival. These findings provide mechanisms through which females may maximize reproductive output in changing environments.",2016,"Jenke A Gorter, Samyukta Jagadeesh, Christoph Gahr, Jelle J Boonekamp, Joel D Levine, Jean-Christophe Billeter, Jenke A Gorter, Samyukta Jagadeesh, Christoph Gahr, Jelle J Boonekamp, Joel D Levine, Jean-Christophe Billeter"
Conversion of the chill susceptible fruit fly larva (Drosophila melanogaster) to a freeze tolerant organism,22331891,10.1073/pnas.1119986109,"Among vertebrates, only a few species of amphibians and reptiles tolerate the formation of ice crystals in their body fluids. Freeze tolerance is much more widespread in invertebrates, especially in overwintering insects. Evolutionary adaptations for freeze tolerance are considered to be highly complex. Here we show that surprisingly simple laboratory manipulations can change the chill susceptible insect to the freeze tolerant one. Larvae of Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly of tropical origin with a weak innate capacity to tolerate mild chilling, can survive when approximately 50% of their body water freezes. To achieve this goal, synergy of two fundamental prerequisites is required: (i) shutdown of larval development by exposing larvae to low temperatures (dormancy) and (ii) incorporating the free amino acid proline in tissues by feeding larvae a proline-augmented diet (cryopreservation).",2012,"Vladimír Koštál, Petr Šimek, Helena Zahradníčková, Jana Cimlová, Tomáš Štětina, Vladimír Koštál, Petr Šimek, Helena Zahradníčková, Jana Cimlová, Tomáš Štětina"
Cell death during Drosophila melanogaster early oogenesis is mediated through autophagy,19066465,10.4161/auto.5.3.7454,"Autophagy is a physiological and evolutionarily conserved process maintaining homeostatic functions, such as protein degradation and organelle turnover. Accumulating data provide evidence that autophagy also contributes to cell death under certain circumstances, but how this is achieved is not well known. Herein, we report that autophagy occurs during developmentally-induced cell death in the female germline, observed in the germarium and during middle developmental stages of oogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Degenerating germline cells exhibit caspase activation, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation and punctate staining of mCherry-DrAtg8a, a novel marker for monitoring autophagy in Drosophila. Genetic inhibition of autophagy, by removing atg1 or atg7 function, results in significant reduction of DNA fragmentation, suggesting that autophagy acts genetically upstream of DNA fragmentation in this tissue.

Using Southern blotting, five strains characterized by increased copy number of MDG4 with significant prevalence of the active variant over the less active one were selected for further analysis. Genetic analysis of these strains led to the suggestion that some of them carry factors that mobilize MDG4 independently from the cellular flamenco gene known to be responsible for transposition of this element.

The typical fast green-positive histone appears at the close of the period of the synchronized cleavage mitoses, just before blastulation, when nucleoli are first produced. The amount of DNA of the cleavage nuclei, as determined cytophotometrically, is nearly constant; therefore, the DNA moiety of the nucleohistone complex seems to remain unaffected by the protein shift during embryonic development.

These processes rely on a set of genes whose PCP function is conserved in mammals and Drosophila Melanogaster for some, or only present in mammals for others. In 2003, the inner ear was identified as a model to study PP in mammals and allowed the identification of the first important genes.

From the available literature, such nuanced memories for the quality of reinforcement are unexpected and pose a challenge to present models of how insect memory is organized.

Using Drosophila, we identify new O-GlcNAcylated PcG proteins and develop an antibody-free metabolic feeding approach to chemoselectively map genomic loci enriched in O-GlcNAc using next-generation sequencing. We find that O-GlcNAc is distributed to specific genomic loci both in cells and in vivo. Many of these loci overlap with PREs, but O-GlcNAc is also present at other loci lacking PREs.

Sex combs are important for male mating success in Drosophila melanogaster,18213513,10.1007/s10519-008-9190-7,"The sex comb is one of the most rapidly evolving male-specific traits in Drosophila, making it an attractive model to study sexual selection and developmental evolution. Drosophila males use their sex combs to grasp the females' abdomen and genitalia and to spread their wings prior to copulation. To test the role of this structure in male mating success in Drosophila melanogaster, we genetically ablated the sex comb by expressing the female-specific isoform of the sex determination gene transformer in the tarsal segments of male legs. This technique does not remove the sex comb entirely, but simply restores the morphology of its constituent bristles to the ancestral condition found in Drosophila species that lack sex combs. Direct observations and differences in long-term insemination rates show that the loss of the sex comb strongly reduces the ability of males to copulate with females. Detailed analysis of video recordings indicates that this effect is not due to changes in the males' courtship behavior. Rapid evolution of sex comb morphology may be driven either by changes in female preferences, or by co-evolution between sex combs and female external genitalia.",2008,"Chen Siang Ng, Artyom Kopp, Chen Siang Ng, Artyom Kopp"

Comparison of the Drosophila U1 sequence with vertebrate U1 sequences allows a particular secondary structure model to be preferred over others.

Gene density profile reveals the marking of late replicated domains in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,20602235,10.1007/s00412-010-0280-y,"Regulation of replication timing has been a focus of many studies.

Anomalies in the expression profile of interspecific hybrids of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,14962989,10.1101/gr.2019804,"When females of Drosophila melanogaster and males of Drosophila simulans are mated, the male progeny are inviable, whereas the female progeny display manifold malformations and are sterile. These abnormalities result from genetic incompatibilities accumulated since the time the lineages of the species diverged, and may have their origin in aberrant gene transcription. Because compensatory changes within species may obscure differences at the regulatory level in conventional comparisons of the expression profile between species, we have compared the gene-expression profile of hybrid females with those of females of the parental species in order to identify regulatory incompatibilities. In the hybrid females, we find abnormal levels of messenger RNA for a large fraction of the Drosophila transcriptome. These include a gross underexpression of genes preferentially expressed in females, accompanying gonadal atrophy. The hybrid females also show significant overexpression of male-biased genes, which we attribute to incompatibilities in the regulatory mechanisms that normally act to control the expression of these genes in females. The net result of the multiple incompatibilities is that the gene-expression profiles of the parental females are more similar to each other than either is to that of the hybrid.",2004,"José M Ranz, Kalsang Namgyal, Greg Gibson, Daniel L Hartl, José M Ranz, Kalsang Namgyal, Greg Gibson, Daniel L Hartl"
Differing strategies of patterning of follicular cells in higher and lower brachycerans (Diptera: Brachycera),16100706,10.1002/gene.20155,"In all higher dipterans (Brachycera), including the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, each egg chamber (ovarian follicle) consists of a group (clone) of germ cells (one oocyte and 15 accompanying nurse cells) that is surrounded by a layer of somatic mesodermal follicular cells (FCs). As oogenesis progresses the initially uniform FCs diversify into several morphologically and functionally distinct subpopulations. In D. melanogaster some of these subpopulations, e.g., border, centripetal, and dorsolateral cells, undertake coordinated migration or rearrangement over the surface of the germ cells. During the final stages of oogenesis these subpopulations participate in the formation of a complex, regionally specialized eggshell. In representatives of lower brachycerans (Orthorrhapha), only FCs that undertake active, directed migration are the border cells. These cells originate at the anterior pole of the ovarian follicle and migrate between the nurse cells to the anterior pole of the oocyte. Reduced motility of FCs in lower brachycerans results in the absence of certain FC subpopulations in their egg chambers and subsequent simplicity of their eggshells. We found that the lack of some FC subpopulations coincided with the appearance of lamellipodium-like protrusions of the oocyte. These protrusions penetrated between the apposing membranes of nurse and FCs and partially enveloped the nurse cell compartment. Analysis of whole-mount preparations stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin revealed that the protrusions contained microfilaments and that their tips were equipped with actin-rich filopodium-like processes. We also found that in some lower brachycerans (representatives of the family Rhagionidae), the FCs located at the posterior pole of the oocyte, became enlarged and morphologically similar to the anterior border cells. These findings indicate that in higher dipterans the processes leading to the formation of a functional egg are variable and often markedly different from those in the model organism, D. melanogaster.",2005,"Waclaw Tworzydlo, Anna Jablonska, Elzbieta Kisiel, Szczepan M Bilinski, Waclaw Tworzydlo, Anna Jablonska, Elzbieta Kisiel, Szczepan M Bilinski"

The effect of anesthesia on the photoresponses of four sympatric species of Drosophila,8476397,10.1007/BF01067559,"Five isofemale strains from each of four sympatric species, Drosophila immigrans, D. repleta, D. melanogaster, and D. affinis, were lightly anesthetized with ether, CO2, Flynap, or cold temperature. The photoresponse of each treatment group was measured in an open field and a Y-tube apparatus. Relative light values were compared with those of the unanesthetized control groups of each species, as well as among the different treatments themselves and among species. Significant differences between species were apparent for all treatments in the Y-tube and for all treatments except ether and CO2 in the open field. Response to anesthesia may differ between species due, in part, to their differing genotypes. Comparing treatment groups within species in the Y-tube design, all species except D. melanogaster showed significant differences between treatments. In the open field, only D. affinis was significantly affected. Particularly in the Y-tube, anesthetized flies generally differed significantly from the controls, indicating that the use of anesthesia during a behavioral study could cause deviations in behavior from that of normal unanesthetized flies.",1993,"M B Seiger, J F Kink, M B Seiger, J F Kink"
Genetics of food preference in Drosophila sechellia. I. Responses to food attractants,8224853,10.1007/BF02424469,"To reveal the genetic mechanism of host selection in a monophagous fruit fly Drosophila sechellia, olfactory responses and oviposition preferences of this species were compared with those of closely related polyphagous species, D. simulans and D. melanogaster. Adult flies of D. sechellia were strongly attracted to the ripe fruit of Morinda citrifolia which is known to be the sole breeding site of this species. They were also attracted to the odor of n-caproic acid which is contained in the ripe fruit of M. citrifolia and is presumably responsible for the characteristic odor of the fruit. In contrast, D. simulans and D. melanogaster showed a strong repulsion to n-caproic acid. In parallel with the olfactory responses, D. sechellia females laid eggs preferentially on a medium containing n-caproic acid, to which the other two species showed an aversion. Genetic analyses using the hybrid progeny between D. sechellia and D. simulans suggested that the species differences in these behaviors are controlled by gene(s) located on the second chromosome.",1993,"I Higa, Y Fuyama, I Higa, Y Fuyama"
Life span and locomotor activity modification by glucose and polyphenols in Drosophila melanogaster chronically exposed to oxidative stress-stimuli: implications in Parkinson's disease,21442225,10.1007/s11064-011-0451-0,"Previous studies have shown that polyphenols might be potent neuroprotective agents in Drosophila melanogaster, a valid model for PD, acutely treated with oxidative stress-stimulants. This study report for the first time that polyphenols exposure prolong life span (P < 0.05 by log-rang test) and restore locomotor activity (i.e., climbing capability, P < 0.05 by χ(2) test) of Drosophila melanogaster chronically exposed to paraquat compared to flies treated with paraquat alone in 1% glucose. We found that (10%) glucose partially prolongs life span and climbing in Drosophila exposed to iron, PQ or in combination, suggesting that both stimuli enhance a movement disorder in a concentration-dependent and temporal-related fashion. Moreover, chronic exposure of (1 mM) PQ/(0.5 mM) iron synergistically affect both survival and locomotor function independently of the temporal order of the exposure to the toxicants, but the survival is modulated in a concentration and temporal fashion by glucose. This investigation is the first to report that Ddc-GAL4 transgenic flies chronically fed with polyphenols increase life span (P < 0.05 by log-rang test) and enhance movement abilities (P < 0.05 by χ(2) test) compared to untreated Ddc-GAL4 or treated with paraquat in 1% glucose. Our present findings support the notion that Drosophila melanogaster might be a suitable model to study genetic, environmental and nutritional factors as causal and/or modulators in the development of PD. Most importantly, according to our model, we have demonstrated for the first time chronic polyphenols exposure as potential therapeutic compounds in the treatment of PD. These findings altogether open new avenues for the screening, testing and development of novel antioxidant drugs against oxidative stress stimuli.",2011,"Hector Flavio Ortega-Arellano, Marlene Jimenez-Del-Rio, Carlos Velez-Pardo, Hector Flavio Ortega-Arellano, Marlene Jimenez-Del-Rio, Carlos Velez-Pardo"
"Two novel annexins from Drosophila melanogaster. Cloning, characterization, and differential expression in development",2141610,,"The annexins are a family of homologous Ca2(+)- and phospholipid-binding proteins that until now have only been found in vertebrates. cDNA clones encoding two novel annexins from Drosophila melanogaster were isolated and characterized. RNA blots indicate that the messages for the two Drosophila proteins are differentially expressed in development, with one message being expressed throughout development, while the other is only found in early embryos and adult flies. In situ hybridizations localize the two Drosophila genes to 93B and 19A-4,7. A similarly high degree of homology relates Drosophila annexins to different vertebrate annexins, indicating that the Drosophila annexins are not the invertebrate homologues of particular mammalian annexins but that they constitute novel members of the annexin gene family. In continuation with a recently established terminology, the Drosophila annexins will be named annexins IX and X. The biochemical properties of Drosophila annexin X were investigated using recombinant protein. Similar to vertebrate annexins, annexin X bound to liver membranes and liposomes containing phosphatidylserine in a calcium-dependent manner but not to liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine. In addition, annexin X partitioned into the detergent phase of Triton X-114 as a function of calcium. The conservation of the annexin family of Ca2(+)-binding proteins in invertebrates suggests that they have a basic function in cells which is not peculiar to vertebrate biology, and the availability of the Drosophila sequences will open avenues for mutational studies of these functions.",1990,"P A Johnston, M S Perin, G A Reynolds, S A Wasserman, T C Südhof, P A Johnston, M S Perin, G A Reynolds, S A Wasserman, T C Südhof"
Conserved alternative splicing patterns and splicing signals in the Drosophila sodium channel gene para,8536968,,"We cloned genomic DNA corresponding to the Drosophila virilis homologue of para, a gene encoding a sodium channel alpha-subunit, and obtained many partial cDNA clones from embryos and adults. Para protein has been well conserved, and the optional elements at six different sites of alternative splicing in D. melanogaster are present in D. virilis, in addition to one new optional exon. Among 31 different splice-types observed in D. virilis, the stage-specific pattern of alternative splicing seen in D. melanogaster is also conserved. Comparison of genomic DNA sequence revealed three aspects that vary between alternatively and constitutively used exon sequences. Sixteen short blocks (10-75 bp), the only recognizably conserved intron sequence, were disproportionately associated with alternatively used splice sites. Silent site substitutions were found much less frequently in alternative than constitutive exon elements, and the degree of match to the Drosophila splice site consensus tended to be lower at less frequently selected alternative splice junctions. This study shows that the developmentally regulated variability of para products is highly conserved and therefore likely to be of functional significance and suggests that a variety of different sequence-dependent mechanisms may regulate this pattern of alternative splicing.",1995,"J R Thackeray, B Ganetzky, J R Thackeray, B Ganetzky"
Pervasive epigenetic effects of Drosophila euchromatic transposable elements impact their evolution,28695823,10.7554/eLife.25762,"Transposable elements (TEs) are widespread genomic parasites, and their evolution has remained a critical question in evolutionary genomics. Here, we study the relatively unexplored epigenetic impacts of TEs and provide the first genome-wide quantification of such effects in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Surprisingly, the spread of repressive epigenetic marks (histone H3K9me2) to nearby DNA occurs at >50% of euchromatic TEs, and can extend up to 20 kb. This results in differential epigenetic states of genic alleles and, in turn, selection against TEs. Interestingly, the lower TE content in D. simulans compared to D. melanogaster correlates with stronger epigenetic effects of TEs and higher levels of host genetic factors known to promote epigenetic silencing. Our study demonstrates that the epigenetic effects of euchromatic TEs, and host genetic factors modulating such effects, play a critical role in the evolution of TEs both within and between species.",2017,"Yuh Chwen G Lee, Gary H Karpen, Yuh Chwen G Lee, Gary H Karpen"

We report the sequence of the first 704 nucleotides of each gene as well as 127 bases in the 5' untranslated region. When these sequences are compared, D. melanogaster differs from D. simulans and D. mauritiana by 2.8% and 3.1%, respectively. D. simulans and D. mauritiana differ by only 1.8%, implying that they are more closely related to each other than either is to D. melanogaster.

Insecticide Resistance in Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae) is Associated with Field Control Failure of Sour Rot Disease in a New York Vineyard,30796790,10.1093/jee/toz039,"Sour rot is a complex disease of grapes caused by an interaction of yeast, acetic acid bacteria, and Drosophila spp. Application of insecticides (most commonly zeta-cypermethrin) targeting Drosophila has previously provided substantial control of sour rot in wine grapes of New York vineyards. In harvest season of 2018, a control failure of sour rot and high populations of Drosophila, mostly Drosophila melanogaster, were observed in a vineyard in the Finger Lakes region, NY, despite repeated applications of zeta-cypermethrin (Mustang Maxx). To determine if resistance was responsible for the control failure, we quantified the toxicity of zeta-cypermethrin and the four other insecticides registered for Drosophila control in NY vineyards. Diagnostic concentrations (susceptible strain LC95, 4 × LC95, and 16 × LC95) were used to evaluate percentage survival of the field flies relative to the susceptible Canton-S strain. Resistance to zeta-cypermethrin, acetamiprid, and malathion, but not to spinosad and spinetoram, was observed in the field-collected flies. This study provides evidence that insecticide resistance of Drosophila is associated with control failure of sour rot in some vineyards, and directly influencing grape production.

"The internal structure of embryonic gonads and testis development in Drosophila melanogaster requires scrib, lgl and dlg activity in the soma",23585349,10.1387/ijdb.120087fp,"Interest in the mechanism leading to the formation of the germline and its differentiation during Drosophila development, initiated even as soon as the first ever cloned tumour suppressor gene in Drosophila, the lethal (2) giant larvae (lgl), had been identified. Further work has shown that the lgl, as well as discs large-1 (dlg) and scribble (scrib) tumor suppressor genes code for scaffolding proteins associated with either the cytoskeletal matrix or the septate junctions that act in common pathways in various tissues. This study analysed the role of Dlg, Scrib and Lgl in the embryonic gonads and testis of Drosophila melanogaster. Loss of scrib, dlg and lgl had no effect on gonad formation, but Dlg and Scrib in the gonadal mesoderm acted critically in the somatic wrapping of the pole cells and the internal structure of the Drosophila embryonic gonads. Dlg also affected the incorporation of the male-specific Sox100B positive mesodermal cells into the male embryonic gonads, yet Sox100B expression in dlg testis remained unaffected. Analysis at later stages revealed that scrib and lgl expression in the somatic lineage of the Drosophila testis, similar to what was previously shown for dlg, was indispensable for testis development and homeostasis, as depletion of these genes resulted in extensive testes defects. The data presented here emphasize the somatic requirement of Scrib, Dlg and Lgl in embryonic gonads, as well as in the Drosophila testis that underlines the importance of the somatic lineage in the establishment and maintenance of testis formation throughout successive developmental stages.",2013,"Fani Papagiannouli, Fani Papagiannouli"
Identification and characterization of retinoid-active short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases in Drosophila melanogaster,19520149,10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.06.002,"Background:
      
    

    
      In chordates, retinoid metabolism is an important target of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs). It is not known whether SDRs play a role in retinoid metabolism of protostomes, such as Drosophila melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Drosophila genome was searched for genes encoding proteins with approximately 50% identity to human retinol dehydrogenase 12 (RDH12). The corresponding proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells and biochemically characterized. Their phylogenetic relationships were analyzed using PHYLIP software.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      A total of six Drosophila SDR genes were identified. Five of these genes are clustered on chromosome 2 and one is located on chromosome X. The deduced proteins are 300 to 406 amino acids long and are associated with microsomal membranes. They recognize all-trans-retinaldehyde and all-trans-3-hydroxyretinaldehyde as substrates and prefer NADPH as a cofactor. Phylogenetically, Drosophila SDRs belong to the same branch of the SDR superfamily as human RDH12, indicating a common ancestry early in bilaterian evolution, before a protostome-deuterostome split.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Similarities in the substrate and cofactor specificities of Drosophila versus human SDRs suggest conservation of their function in retinoid metabolism throughout protostome and deuterostome phyla.

Studies of D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, and D. virilis show that, in Drosophila, telomeres are composed of two non-LTR retrotransposons, HeT-A and TART. Far from being static, HeT-A and TART evolve faster than Drosophila euchromatic genes. In spite of their high rate of sequence change, HeT-A and TART maintain their basic structures and unusual individual features. The maintenance of their separate identities suggests that HeT-A and TART cooperate either in the process of retrotransposition onto the chromosome end, or in the formation of telomere chromatin by transposed DNA copies. The telomeric retrotransposons and the Drosophila genome constitute an example of a robust symbiotic relationship between mobile elements and the genome.",2005,"E Casacuberta, M-L Pardue, E Casacuberta, M-L Pardue"

Larvae of many Drosophila species can defend themselves against attack by parasitoids through a cellular immune response called encapsulation. The paper reviews recent studies of the evolutionary biology and ecological genetics of resistance in Drosophila, concentrating on D. melanogaster. The physiological basis of encapsulation, and the genes known to interfere with resistance are briefly summarized. Evidence for within- and between-population genetic variation in resistance from isofemale line, artificial selection and classical genetic studies are reviewed. There is now firm evidence that resistance is costly to Drosophila, and the nature of this cost is discussed, and the possibility that it may involve a reduction in metabolic rate considered. Comparative data on encapsulation and metabolic rates across seven Drosophila species provides support for this hypothesis. Finally, the possible population and community ecological consequences of evolution in the levels of host resistance are examined.",2000,"M D Fellowes, H C Godfray, M D Fellowes, H C Godfray"
Porphyromonas gingivalis-host interactions in a Drosophila melanogaster model,21041486,10.1128/IAI.00785-10,"Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative obligate anaerobe that has been implicated in the etiology of adult periodontitis. We recently introduced a Drosophila melanogaster killing model for examination of P. gingivalis-host interactions. In the current study, the Drosophila killing model was used to characterize the host response to P. gingivalis infection by identifying host components that play a role during infection. Drosophila immune response gene mutants were screened for altered susceptibility to killing by P. gingivalis. The Imd signaling pathway was shown to be important for the survival of Drosophila infected by nonencapsulated P. gingivalis strains but was dispensable for the survival of Drosophila infected by encapsulated P. gingivalis strains. The P. gingivalis capsule was shown to mediate resistance to killing by Drosophila antimicrobial peptides (Imd pathway-regulated cecropinA and drosocin) and human beta-defensin 3. Drosophila thiol-ester protein II (Tep II) and Tep IV and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) homolog Eiger were also involved in the immune response against P. gingivalis infection, while the scavenger receptors Eater and Croquemort played no roles in the response to P. gingivalis infection.

Evolution of yellow gene regulation and pigmentation in Drosophila,12372246,10.1016/s0960-9822(02)01113-2,"Background:
      
    

    
      Changes in developmental gene expression are central to phenotypic evolution, but the genetic mechanisms underlying these changes are not well understood. Interspecific differences in gene expression can arise from evolutionary changes in cis-regulatory DNA and/or in the expression of trans-acting regulatory proteins, but few case studies have distinguished between these mechanisms. Here, we compare the regulation of the yellow gene, which is required for melanization, among distantly related Drosophila species with different pigment patterns and determine the phenotypic effects of divergent Yellow expression.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Yellow expression has diverged among D. melanogaster, D. subobscura, and D. virilis and, in all cases, correlates with the distribution of black melanin. Species-specific Yellow expression patterns were retained in D. melanogaster transformants carrying the D. subobscura and D. virilis yellow genes, indicating that sequence evolution within the yellow gene underlies the divergence of Yellow expression. Evolutionary changes in the activity of orthologous cis-regulatory elements are responsible for differences in abdominal Yellow expression; however, cis-regulatory element evolution is not the sole cause of divergent Yellow expression patterns. Transformation of the D. melanogaster yellow gene into D. virilis altered its expression pattern, indicating that trans-acting factors that regulate the D. melanogaster yellow gene have also diverged between these two species. Finally, we found that the phenotypic effects of evolutionary changes in Yellow expression depend on epistatic interactions with other genes.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Evolutionary changes in Yellow expression correlate with divergent melanin patterns and are a result of evolution in both cis- and trans-regulation.

Based on the premise that Ivermectin (IVM) and Amoxicillin (AMX) are commonly considered in parasitic control in mammals, the present study aimed to evaluate the carcinogenic and genotoxic potential of different concentrations of IVM and AMX through the detection of epithelial tumor test in Drosophila melanogaster. Third-instar larvae descending from the cross between wts/TM3, Sb1 females and mwh/mwh males were treated with different concentrations of IVM (2.9, 5.8, 11.6 and 23.2 x 10-17 mM) or AMX (1.37, 2.74, 5.48 and 10.9 x 10-16mM). The results revealed that IVM increased the frequency of epithelial tumor in D. melanogaster considering all evaluated concentrations, while AMX showed no carcinogenic effect. Furthermore, the Micronucleus (MN) test in Tradescantia pallida was used to evaluate the genotoxic effect of IVM and AMX. T. pallida individuals were exposed for 8 hours at different concentrations of IVM (5.71, 11.42, 22.84 and 45.68 x 10-5mM) or AMX (5.13, 10.26, 20.52 and 41.05 x 10-3mM). Findings showed an increase in the frequency of micronuclei in T. pallida treated with 11.42, 22.84 and 45.68 x 10-5mM of IVM. We conclude that chronic exposure to IVM is directly associated with events resulting from genetic instability (genotoxicity and carcinogenicity).

Feeding and attraction of non-target flies to spinosad-based fruit fly bait,16835891,10.1002/ps.1259,"A spinosad-based fruit fly bait, GF-120, has recently become a primary tool for area-wide suppression or eradication of pest tephritid fruit flies. The present study assessed the attraction and feeding of five non-target fly species to GF-120 in Hawaii. These non-target flies include three beneficial tephritid species [Eutreta xanthochaeta (Aldrich), Tetreuaresta obscuriventris (Loew), Ensina sonchi (L.)] introduced for weed biological control, an endemic Hawaiian tephritid [Trupanea dubautiae (Bryan)] (all Diptera: Tephritidae) and the cosmopolitan Drosophila melanogaster Meigen (Diptera: Drosophilidae). All five non-target fly species were susceptible to GF-120, as was the target pest Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann). Feeding on, or even brief tasting of, GF-120 killed all fly species within 2 h. When individual flies were provided with a choice of GF-120 or honey solution, there was no difference in the frequency of first food encounter by E. xanthochaeta, D. melanogaster or C. capitata. The other three non-target species approached honey more often than GF-120 in their first food encounter. Feeding times on GF-120 and honey were not significantly different for D. melanogaster and C. capitata, while the other four non-target species fed longer on honey than on GF-120. There was no significant difference in feeding time on honey versus GF-120 between males and females of each species. These results suggest that area-wide treatment using GF-120 for the purpose of eradication of pest fruit flies has potential negative impacts on these and other non-target fly species in Hawaii.",2006,"Xin-Geng Wang, Russell H Messing, Xin-Geng Wang, Russell H Messing"
Phylogenomics of the reproductive parasite Wolbachia pipientis wMel: a streamlined genome overrun by mobile genetic elements,15024419,10.1371/journal.pbio.0020069,"The complete sequence of the 1,267,782 bp genome of Wolbachia pipientis wMel, an obligate intracellular bacteria of Drosophila melanogaster, has been determined. Wolbachia, which are found in a variety of invertebrate species, are of great interest due to their diverse interactions with different hosts, which range from many forms of reproductive parasitism to mutualistic symbioses. Analysis of the wMel genome, in particular phylogenomic comparisons with other intracellular bacteria, has revealed many insights into the biology and evolution of wMel and Wolbachia in general. For example, the wMel genome is unique among sequenced obligate intracellular species in both being highly streamlined and containing very high levels of repetitive DNA and mobile DNA elements. This observation, coupled with multiple evolutionary reconstructions, suggests that natural selection is somewhat inefficient in wMel, most likely owing to the occurrence of repeated population bottlenecks. Genome analysis predicts many metabolic differences with the closely related Rickettsia species, including the presence of intact glycolysis and purine synthesis, which may compensate for an inability to obtain ATP directly from its host, as Rickettsia can. Other discoveries include the apparent inability of wMel to synthesize lipopolysaccharide and the presence of the most genes encoding proteins with ankyrin repeat domains of any prokaryotic genome yet sequenced. Despite the ability of wMel to infect the germline of its host, we find no evidence for either recent lateral gene transfer between wMel and D. melanogaster or older transfers between Wolbachia and any host. Evolutionary analysis further supports the hypothesis that mitochondria share a common ancestor with the alpha-Proteobacteria, but shows little support for the grouping of mitochondria with species in the order Rickettsiales. With the availability of the complete genomes of both species and excellent genetic tools for the host, the wMel-D. melanogaster symbiosis is now an ideal system for studying the biology and evolution of Wolbachia infections.",2004,"Martin Wu, Ling V Sun, Jessica Vamathevan, Markus Riegler, Robert Deboy, Jeremy C Brownlie, Elizabeth A McGraw, William Martin, Christian Esser, Nahal Ahmadinejad, Christian Wiegand, Ramana Madupu, Maureen J Beanan, Lauren M Brinkac, Sean C Daugherty, A Scott Durkin, James F Kolonay, William C Nelson, Yasmin Mohamoud, Perris Lee, Kristi Berry, M Brook Young, Teresa Utterback, Janice Weidman, William C Nierman, Ian T Paulsen, Karen E Nelson, Hervé Tettelin, Scott L O'Neill, Jonathan A Eisen, Martin Wu, Ling V Sun, Jessica Vamathevan, Markus Riegler, Robert Deboy, Jeremy C Brownlie, Elizabeth A McGraw, William Martin, Christian Esser, Nahal Ahmadinejad, Christian Wiegand, Ramana Madupu, Maureen J Beanan, Lauren M Brinkac, Sean C Daugherty, A Scott Durkin, James F Kolonay, William C Nelson, Yasmin Mohamoud, Perris Lee, Kristi Berry, M Brook Young, Teresa Utterback, Janice Weidman, William C Nierman, Ian T Paulsen, Karen E Nelson, Hervé Tettelin, Scott L O'Neill, Jonathan A Eisen"
Evidence that a high molecular weight replicative DNA polymerase is conserved during evolution,6796965,10.1073/pnas.78.11.6771,"Using a technique developed recently to detect DNA polymerase activity in situ after NaDodSO4 gel electrophoresis (Spanos, A., Sedgwick, S. G., Yarranton, g. T., Hübscher, U. & Banks, G. R.

Not only extracts from Escherichia coli, Ustilago maydis, Drosophila melanogaster, rat neurones, calf thymus, human fibroblast, and HeLa cells possess such high Mr activities, but also highly purified E. coli DNA polymerase III core enzyme, U. maydis DNA polymerase, and D. melanogaster embryo and calf thymus DNA alpha polymerases. The evidence that these activities are responsible for chromosomal DNA replication is genetical (E. coli, U. maydis, and D. melanogaster); also, the high Mr activity disappears from rat neurones during differentiation from an actively dividing precursor cell to a postmitotically mature neurone. Furthermore, when limited proteolysis is allowed to occur, a defined and remarkably similar pattern of intermediate Mr activities is generated in lower eukaryotic and high eukaryotic extracts and, to some extent, in prokaryotic extracts. In higher eukaryotic extracts, a low Mr activity of approximately 35,000 is also generated. Protease inhibitors can retard formation of these catalytically active proteolytic fragments. We propose that the replicative DNA polymerase complex of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes contains a high Mr polypeptide responsible for chain elongation which might be conserved during evolution and which is extremely sensitive to proteolytic cleavage.",1981,"U Hübscher, A Spanos, W Albert, F Grummt, G R Banks, U Hübscher, A Spanos, W Albert, F Grummt, G R Banks"
Disruption of insect isoprenoid biosynthesis with pyridinium bisphosphonates,26073627,10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.05.006,"Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) catalyzes the condensation of the non-allylic diphosphate, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP; C5), with the allylic diphosphate primer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP; C5) to generate the C15 prenyl chain (FPP) used for protein prenylation as well as sterol and terpene biosynthesis. Here, we designed and prepared a series of pyridinium bisphosphonate (PyrBP) compounds, with the aim of selectively inhibiting FPPS of the lepidopteran insect order. FPPSs of Drosophila melanogaster and the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, were inhibited by several PyrBPs, and as hypothesized, larger bisphosphonates were more selective for the lepidopteran protein and completely inactive towards dipteran and vertebrate FPPSs. Cell growth of a D. melanogaster cell line was adversely affected by exposure to PyrPBs that were strongly inhibitory to insect FPPS, although their effect was less pronounced than that observed upon exposure to the electron transport disrupter, chlorfenapyr. To assess the impact of PyrBPs on lepidopteran insect growth and development, we performed feeding and topical studies, using the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, as our insect model. The free acid form of a PyrBP and a known bisphosphonate inhibitor of vertebrate FPPS, alendronate, had little to no effect on larval M. sexta; however, the topical application of more lipophilic ester PyrBPs caused decreased growth, incomplete larval molting, cuticle darkening at the site of application, and for those insects that survived, the formation of larval-pupal hybrids. To gain a better understanding of the structural differences that produce selective lepidopteran FPPS inhibition, homology models of C. fumiferana and D. melanogaster FPPS (CfFPPS2, and DmFPPS) were prepared. Docking of substrates and PyrBPs demonstrates that differences at the -3 and -4 positions relative to the first aspartate rich motif (FARM) are important factors in the ability of the lepidopteran enzyme to produce homologous isoprenoid structure and to be selectively inhibited by larger PyrBPs.",2015,"Stephanie E Sen, Lyndsay Wood, Reshma Jacob, Alisa Xhambazi, Britanny Pease, Alexis Jones, Taylor Horsfield, Alice Lin, Michel Cusson, Stephanie E Sen, Lyndsay Wood, Reshma Jacob, Alisa Xhambazi, Britanny Pease, Alexis Jones, Taylor Horsfield, Alice Lin, Michel Cusson"
"Natural product of wild Zingiberaceae Elettariopsis slahmong: biopesticide to control the vector of banana blood disease bacterium in West Sumatera, Indonesia",25151825,,"Banana is one of the most important food crops in Indonesia. Its production is greater than any other agricultural commodity. With the population of 230 million in 2010, banana was consumed up to three million tons in this country. However, Banana Blood Disease Bacterium (BDB), one of the most devastating banana pathogens in the world, which is only found in Indonesia, threatens not only the growth of this plant but also the lives and the livelihoods for most of the Indonesian society. BDB is caused by a lethal bacteria, Ralstonia solanacearum Phylotype-4, which infects a wide range of bananas, from bananas used for consumption to wild bananas. In West Sumatera, the disease killed 1.40% of bananas in 1998, and then increased dramatically to 37.9% in 2003. The total banana production dropped to 62% in this province. The search for controlling the vector has led to the pre-investigation of Wild Zingiberaceae Elettariopsis slahmong C.K. Lim which has a stink bug odour similar to a methidathion insecticide. The plant was collected around the conservation area of Lembah Anal in West Sumatra. The goal of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of natural insecticides compound contained in E. slahmong against D. melanogaster. This study tested the effect of E. slahmong on the mortality, anti-feedant and repellent levels against Drosophila melanogaster, the vector of BDB. The essential oil of E. slahmong was obtained by steam distillation of fresh rhizomes, pseudo stems and leaves. We found that the extract of E. slahmong significantly affected the mortality of D. melanogaster of 30-40% and also acted as an antifeedant (with success rate of 73-93%) and repellent (with success rate of 99-99.6%).

Interactions of tryptamine derivatives with serotonin transporter species variants implicate transmembrane domain I in substrate recognition,11179447,10.1124/mol.59.3.514,"The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) transporter (SERT) is responsible for the inactivation of synaptic 5-HT and is also a target for multiple psychostimulants. Despite the critical role of SERT in 5-HT inactivation and psychostimulant response, many aspects of the transporter's recognition of ligands are poorly defined. We took advantage of sequence divergence of SERT species variants to identify structural determinants of substrate recognition. Tryptamine derivatives with substitutions at the 4 and 7 positions on the phenyl ring, the indole nitrogen, and the beta position show up to 40-fold potency differences for inhibiting [(3)H]5-HT transport in cells transfected with either human or Drosophila melanogaster SERT cDNAs. Species selectivities of these derivatives were largely recapitulated in antagonist binding. Human/D. melanogaster SERT chimera studies implicated the first two SERT transmembrane domains (TMDs) in the potency of the indole nitrogen-substituted compounds N-isopropyltryptamine (NIT), 5-methoxy-N-isopropyltryptamine (5-MNIT), and the 7-substituted compound 7-benzyloxytryptamine (7BT). Potency differences of analogs with substitutions at the 4 and beta positions are influenced by sequences distal to this region. Within TMD I-II, species-scanning mutagenesis implicated a single residue (Y95 in human SERT, F90 in D. melanogaster SERT) in the recognition of NIT, 5-MNIT, and 7BT. Remarkably, this is the same site we established previously in species-specific recognition of the antagonists citalopram and mazindol.

The Investigations of Nitric Oxide Influence on Lifespan of Fruit Fly D. melanogaster Transgenic Strain dNOS4,29805886,10.5195/cajgh.2014.153,"Introduction:
      
    

    
      Aging and longevity control are among the greatest problems in biology and medicine. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a nice model organism for longevity investigations because of its biological features. Many D. melanogaster genes have their orthologs, similar in other eukaryotes, including human. The role of nitric oxide (NO) in the D. melanogaster lifespan has been analyzed.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Virgin flies of dNOS4 transgenic strain were used for the experiment. This strain contains non-functional additional copies of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) gene under heat shock promoter. For promoter activation, transgenic flies on their second day of life were exposed to heat shock (37°C) for an hour. After heat shock, flies were maintained on standard medium temperatures at 25°C, with females separate from males. Two types of control were used: Oregon R wild-type strain and Oregon R strain exposed to heat shock. The average lifespan was evaluated.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      It was revealed that the longevity of females was significantly higher than males in each series of experiments (p < 0.05). The survival rate of females and males was similar in the first month of their life, but in the second month the mortality among males was much higher than among females in all series of experiments. The average lifespan of dNOS4 imago was 31 days (34 days for females and 28 days for males), maximum lifespan was 63 days. In controls, the average lifespan of Oregon R flies was 54 days (58 days for females and 50 days for males), and the maximum lifespan was 94 days. The average lifespan of Oregon R flies exposed to heat shock was 45 days (48 days for females and 41 days for males), and the maximum lifespan was 72 days. The difference between average lifespan in all studied groups is statistically significant (p < 0.05).
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Thus, NOS-transgene activation results in formation of non-functional dNOS4-transcripts and NO deficiency. In turn, NO deficiency decreases dNOS4 imago lifespan.",2014,"Mamura Begmanova, Nata Mit, Anara Amirgaliyeva, A Tolebayeva, Leyla Djansugurova, Mamura Begmanova, Nata Mit, Anara Amirgaliyeva, A Tolebayeva, Leyla Djansugurova"

In the present study, changes in 15N/14N and 13C/12C ratios in the lycosid spider Pardosa lugubris (Araneae: Lycosidae), fed with prey of different quality, were investigated. Experimental food chains included three trophic levels: prey media, prey organism and predator. In order to analyse the time course of stable isotope enrichment, different life stages of P. lugubris feeding on Drosophila melanogaster were studied. The 15N content of hatchlings of P. lugubris was significantly lower than that of their mothers, indicating the existence of nitrogen pools with different 15N signatures in female P. lugubris. With duration of feeding and progressing development, age and body weight, the 15N content in spiderlings increased. Starvation resulted in 15N and 13C enrichment in P. lugubris. Being fed with prey of different quality resulted in varying patterns of stable isotope enrichment. 15N but not 13C content consistently increased when fed on high quality prey (Heteromurus nitidus, D. melanogaster and a mixed diet consisting of H. nitidus and D. melanogaster). In contrast, low quality prey (Rhopalosiphum padi, Folsomia candida and a mixed diet consisting of H. nitidus, D. melanogaster and F. candida) resulted in deviations from postulated patterns of stable isotope enrichment with 15N content being similar to that of starving spiderlings. When fed on high quality prey, 15N enrichment of P. lugubris was close to ca. 3‰. It is concluded that the analysis of variations in the natural abundance of stable isotopes is particularly helpful in revealing the trophic structure of terrestrial food webs in which polyphagous feeders predominate, as is the case in litter and soil.",2002,"Katja Oelbermann, Stefan Scheu, Katja Oelbermann, Stefan Scheu"
"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae ADE5,7 protein is homologous to overlapping Drosophila melanogaster Gart polypeptides",3097325,10.1016/0022-2836(86)90238-x,"The Drosophila melanogaster Gart locus encodes two polypeptides specified by overlapping alternative transcripts. One transcript encodes only glycinamide ribotide synthetase (GARSase) on a 45,000 Mr polypeptide, while the other encodes GARSase aminoimidazole ribotide synthetase (AIRSase), and glycinamide ribotide transformylase (GARTase) on a 145,000 Mr polypeptide. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glycinamide ribotide synthetase and aminoimidazole ribotide synthetase are encoded at the ADE5,7 locus. Here I report the cloning, sequencing, and determination of the transcriptional organization of the yeast ADE5,7 gene. There is sufficient homology to align the predicted 802 amino acid ADE5,7 polypeptide with its Drosophila counterpart. These results, together with the sequence of the S. cerevisiae ADE8 gene encoding glycinamide ribotide transformylase, show that the entire Drosophila large polypeptide can be accounted for by the three enzymatic activities. A novel finding is that successive Drosophila domains are each homologous to the aminoimidazole ribotide synthetase portion of the yeast ADE5,7 gene, such that regions of homology with yeast aminoimidazole ribotide synthetase alternate from one of the Drosophila repeats to the other. Such a relationship suggests that the two Drosophila aminoimidazole ribotide synthetase domains together participate in catalysis. This model is consistent with a 20-year-old explanation of complex interallelic complementation such as that characterizing the gene segment encoding yeast aminoimidazole ribotide synthetase.",1986,"S Henikoff, S Henikoff"
Search for a Drosophila-93D-like locus in Chironomus and Anopheles,1905218,,"The results of experiments to explore the possible existence of a heat shock locus in Chironomus and Anopheles which may be comparable to the 93D heat shock locus of Drosophila, are presented. None of the heat shock loci in C. striatipennis were inducible by benzamide, colchicine, vitamin B6, thiamphenicol or a homogenate of heat shocked glands, all of which are known to selectively induce the 93D-like loci in the genus Drosophila. Benzamide also failed to induce any locus in A. stephensi. The effect of all these treatments on general transcription in Chironomus and Anopheles polytene nuclei were comparable to those known in polytene cells of Drosophila. It thus appears that a heat shock locus homologous to 93D of D. melanogaster is absent in Chironomus and Anopheles so far as inducibility of a puff by specific agents is concerned.

Comparative Cytology of Female Meiosis I Among Drosophila Species,32217631,10.1534/g3.120.400867,"The physical connections established by recombination are normally sufficient to ensure proper chromosome segregation during female Meiosis I. However, nonexchange chromosomes (such as the Muller F element or ""dot"" chromosome in D. melanogaster) can still segregate accurately because they remain connected by heterochromatic tethers. A recent study examined female meiosis in the closely related species D. melanogaster and D. simulans, and found a nearly twofold difference in the mean distance the obligately nonexchange dot chromosomes were separated during Prometaphase. That study proposed two speculative hypotheses for this difference, the first being the amount of heterochromatin in each species, and the second being the species' differing tolerance for common inversions in natural populations. We tested these hypotheses by examining female meiosis in 12 additional Drosophila species. While neither hypothesis had significant support, we did see 10-fold variation in dot chromosome sizes, and fivefold variation in the frequency of chromosomes out on the spindle, which were both significantly correlated with chromosome separation distances. In addition to demonstrating that heterochromatin abundance changes chromosome behavior, this implies that the duration of Prometaphase chromosome movements must be proportional to the size of the F element in these species. Additionally, we examined D. willistoni, a species that lacks a free dot chromosome. We observed that chromosomes still moved out on the meiotic spindle, and the F element was always positioned closest to the spindle poles. This result is consistent with models where one role of the dot chromosomes is to help organize the meiotic spindle.",2020,"Ahmed Majekodunmi, Amelia O Bowen, William D Gilliland, Ahmed Majekodunmi, Amelia O Bowen, William D Gilliland"
Variation in the susceptibility of Drosophila to different entomopathogenic nematodes,25561714,10.1128/IAI.02740-14,"Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) in the genera Heterorhabditis and Steinernema are lethal parasites of insects that are of interest as models for understanding parasite-host interactions and as biocontrol agents for insect pests. EPNs harbor a bacterial endosymbiont in their gut that assists in insect killing. EPNs are capable of infecting and killing a wide range of insects, yet how the nematodes and their bacterial endosymbionts interact with the insect immune system is poorly understood. Here, we develop a versatile model system for understanding the insect immune response to parasitic nematode infection that consists of seven species of EPNs as model parasites and five species of Drosophila fruit flies as model hosts. We show that the EPN Steinernema carpocapsae, which is widely used for insect control, is capable of infecting and killing D. melanogaster larvae. S. carpocapsae is associated with the bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophila, and we show that X. nematophila induces expression of a subset of antimicrobial peptide genes and suppresses the melanization response to the nematode. We further show that EPNs vary in their virulence toward D. melanogaster and that Drosophila species vary in their susceptibilities to EPN infection. Differences in virulence among different EPN-host combinations result from differences in both rates of infection and rates of postinfection survival. Our results establish a powerful model system for understanding mechanisms of host-parasite interactions and the insect immune response to parasitic nematode infection.",2015,"Jennifer M Peña, Mayra A Carrillo, Elissa A Hallem, Jennifer M Peña, Mayra A Carrillo, Elissa A Hallem"

Therefore, each patient may carry an individual structural variant of DNA sequence (SV) with small insertions and deletions (INDELs) sometimes less than 10 bp. The transposable elements of the Tc1/mariner superfamily are often associated with hotspots for homologous recombination involved in human genetic disorders, such as Williams Beuren Syndromes (WBS) with LIM-kinase 1-dependent cognitive defects. The Drosophila melanogaster mutant agnts3 has unusual architecture of the agnostic locus harboring LIMK1: it is a hotspot of chromosome breaks, ectopic contacts, underreplication, and recombination. Here, we present the analysis of LIMK1-containing locus sequencing data in agnts3 and three D. melanogaster wild-type strains-Canton-S, Berlin, and Oregon-R. We found multiple strain-specific SVs, namely, single base changes and small INDEls. The specific feature of agnts3 is 28 bp A/T-rich insertion in intron 1 of LIMK1 and the insertion of mobile S-element from Tc1/mariner superfamily residing ~460 bp downstream LIMK1 3'UTR. Neither of SVs leads to amino acid substitutions in agnts3 LIMK1. However, they apparently affect the nucleosome distribution, non-canonical DNA structure formation and transcriptional factors binding. Interestingly, the overall expression of miRNAs including the biomarkers for human neurological diseases, is drastically reduced in agnts3 relative to the wild-type strains. Thus, LIMK1 DNA structure per se, as well as the pronounced changes in total miRNAs profile, probably lead to LIMK1 dysregulation and complex behavioral dysfunctions observed in agnts3 making this mutant a simple plausible Drosophila model for WBS.",2017,"Elena V Savvateeva-Popova, Aleksandr V Zhuravlev, Václav Brázda, Gennady A Zakharov, Alena N Kaminskaya, Anna V Medvedeva, Ekaterina A Nikitina, Elena V Tokmatcheva, Julia F Dolgaya, Dina A Kulikova, Olga G Zatsepina, Sergei Y Funikov, Sergei S Ryazansky, Michail B Evgen'ev, Elena V Savvateeva-Popova, Aleksandr V Zhuravlev, Václav Brázda, Gennady A Zakharov, Alena N Kaminskaya, Anna V Medvedeva, Ekaterina A Nikitina, Elena V Tokmatcheva, Julia F Dolgaya, Dina A Kulikova, Olga G Zatsepina, Sergei Y Funikov, Sergei S Ryazansky, Michail B Evgen'ev"
Surfeit locus gene homologs are widely distributed in invertebrate genomes,8816471,10.1128/mcb.16.10.5591,"The mouse Surfeit locus contains six sequence-unrelated genes (Surf-1 to -6) arranged in the tightest gene cluster so far described for mammals. The organization and juxtaposition of five of the Surfeit genes (Surf-1 to -5) are conserved between mammals and birds, and this may reflect a functional or regulatory requirement for the gene clustering. We have undertaken an evolutionary study to determine whether the Surfeit genes are conserved and clustered in invertebrate genomes. Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans homologs of the mouse Surf-4 gene, which encodes an integral membrane protein associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, have been isolated. The amino acid sequences of the Drosophila and C. elegans homologs are highly conserved in comparison with the mouse Surf-4 protein. In particular, a dilysine motif implicated in endoplasmic reticulum localization of the mouse protein is conserved in the invertebrate homologs. We show that the Drosophila Surf-4 gene, which is transcribed from a TATA-less promoter, is not closely associated with other Drosophila Surfeit gene homologs but rather is located upstream from sequences encoding a homolog of a yeast seryl-tRNA synthetase protein. There are at least two closely linked Surf-3/rpL7a genes or highly polymorphic alleles of a single Surf-3/rpL7a gene in the C. elegans genome. The chromosomal locations of the C. elegans Surf-1, Surf-3/rpL7a, and Surf-4 genes have been determined. In D. melanogaster the Surf-3/rpL7a, Surf-4, and Surf-5 gene homologs and in C. elegans the Surf-1, Surf-3/rpL7a, Surf-4, and Surf-5 gene homologs are located on completely different chromosomes, suggesting that any requirement for the tight clustering of the genes in the Surfeit locus is restricted to vertebrate lineages.",1996,"N Armes, M Fried, N Armes, M Fried"

Catalase is induced by ecdysterone and ethanol in Drosophila cells,6800787,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1982.tb05793.x,"Clones sensitive or resistant to ecdysterone and cultured in vitro were isolated from established cell line of Drosophila melanogaster. Ecdysterone (20-hydroxyecdysone), a hormonal steroid of critical importance in insect physiology, induces catalase activity in the sensitive clones. This catalase induction does not occur in clones known to be resistant to the the hormone. The important role of catalase as a scavenger for H2O2 in the aerobic cells (Drosophila cells in culture are consuming oxygen) led to the demonstration of catalatic properties of this induced enzyme.

Heightened condition-dependence of the sexual transcriptome as a function of genetic quality in Drosophila melanogaster head tissue,31288700,10.1098/rspb.2019.0819,"Theory suggests sexual traits should show heightened condition-dependent expression. This prediction has been tested extensively in experiments where condition has been manipulated through environmental quality. Condition-dependence as a function of genetic quality has, however, only rarely been addressed, despite its central importance in evolutionary theory. To address the effect of genetic quality on expression of sexual and non-sexual traits, we here compare gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster head tissue between flies with intact genomes (high condition) and flies carrying a major deleterious mutation (low condition). We find that sex-biased genes show heightened condition-dependent expression in both sexes, and that expression in low condition males and females regresses towards a more similar expression profile. As predicted, sex-biased expression was more sensitive to condition in males compared to females, but surprisingly female-biased, rather than male-biased, genes show higher sensitivity to condition in both sexes. Our results thus support the fundamental predictions of the theory of condition-dependence when condition is a function of genetic quality.",2019,"Antonino Malacrinò, Christopher M Kimber, Martin Brengdahl, Urban Friberg, Antonino Malacrinò, Christopher M Kimber, Martin Brengdahl, Urban Friberg"
Pleiotropic effects of regulatory variation in tan result in correlation of two pigmentation traits in Drosophila melanogaster,29957826,10.1111/mec.14781,"Traits with a common genetic basis frequently display correlated phenotypic responses to selection or environmental conditions. In Drosophila melanogaster, pigmentation of the abdomen and a trident-shaped region on the thorax are genetically correlated. Here, we used a pooled replicated genomewide association approach (Pool-GWAS) to identify the genetic basis of variation in thoracic trident pigmentation in two Drosophila melanogaster populations. We confirmed the previously reported large effect of ebony and the association of the cosmopolitan inversion In(3R)Payne. For the first time, we identified tan as another major locus contributing to variation in trident pigmentation. Intriguingly, the regulatory variants of tan that were most strongly associated with female abdominal pigmentation also showed a strong association with trident pigmentation. We validated this common genetic basis in transgenic assays and found qualitatively similar effects on trident and abdominal pigmentation. Further work is required to determine whether this genetic correlation is favoured by natural selection or reflects a neutral by-product of a shared regulatory architecture.",2018,"Lukas Endler, Jean-Michel Gibert, Viola Nolte, Christian Schlötterer, Lukas Endler, Jean-Michel Gibert, Viola Nolte, Christian Schlötterer"
One prophage WO gene rescues cytoplasmic incompatibility in Drosophila melanogaster,29686091,10.1073/pnas.1800650115,"Wolbachia are maternally inherited, intracellular bacteria at the forefront of vector control efforts to curb arbovirus transmission. In international field trials, the cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) drive system of wMel Wolbachia is deployed to replace target vector populations, whereby a Wolbachia-induced modification of the sperm genome kills embryos. However, Wolbachia in the embryo rescue the sperm genome impairment, and therefore CI results in a strong fitness advantage for infected females that transmit the bacteria to offspring. The two genes responsible for the wMel-induced sperm modification of CI, cifA and cifB, were recently identified in the eukaryotic association module of prophage WO, but the genetic basis of rescue is unresolved. Here we use transgenic and cytological approaches to demonstrate that maternal cifA expression independently rescues CI and nullifies embryonic death caused by wMel Wolbachia in Drosophila melanogaster Discovery of cifA as the rescue gene and previously one of two CI induction genes establishes a ""Two-by-One"" model that underpins the genetic basis of CI. Results highlight the central role of prophage WO in shaping Wolbachia phenotypes that are significant to arthropod evolution and vector control.",2018,"J Dylan Shropshire, Jungmin On, Emily M Layton, Helen Zhou, Seth R Bordenstein, J Dylan Shropshire, Jungmin On, Emily M Layton, Helen Zhou, Seth R Bordenstein"
Interplay between RNA interference and heat shock response systems in Drosophila melanogaster,27805906,10.1098/rsob.160224,"The genome expression pattern is strongly modified during the heat shock response (HSR) to form an adaptive state. This may be partly achieved by modulating microRNA levels that control the expression of a great number of genes that are embedded within the gene circuitry. Here, we investigated the cross-talk between two highly conserved and universal house-keeping systems, the HSR and microRNA machinery, in Drosophila melanogaster We demonstrated that pronounced interstrain differences in the microRNA levels are alleviated after heat shock (HS) to form a uniform microRNA pattern. However, individual strains exhibit different patterns of microRNA expression during the course of recovery. Importantly, HS-regulated microRNAs may target functionally similar HS-responsive genes involved in the HSR. Despite the observed general downregulation of primary microRNA precursor expression as well as core microRNA pathway genes after HS, the levels of many mature microRNAs are upregulated. This indicates that the regulation of miRNA expression after HS occurs at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. It was also shown that deletion of all hsp70 genes had no significant effect on microRNA biogenesis but might influence the dynamics of microRNA expression during the HSR.",2016,"S Yu Funikov, S S Ryazansky, A A Kanapin, M D Logacheva, A A Penin, A V Snezhkina, V Yu Shilova, D G Garbuz, M B Evgen'ev, O G Zatsepina, S Yu Funikov, S S Ryazansky, A A Kanapin, M D Logacheva, A A Penin, A V Snezhkina, V Yu Shilova, D G Garbuz, M B Evgen'ev, O G Zatsepina"
Cold temperature preference in bacterially infected Drosophila melanogaster improves survival but is remarkably suboptimal,27530304,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2016.08.005,"Altering one's temperature preference (e.g. behavioral fever or behavioral chill) is a common immune defense among ectotherms that is likely to be evolutionarily conserved. However, the temperature chosen by an infected host may not be optimal for pathogen defense, causing preference to be inefficient. Here we examined the efficiency of temperature preference in Drosophila melanogaster infected with an LD50 of the gram negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To this end, we estimated the host's uninfected and infected temperature preferences as well as their optimal survival temperature. We found that flies decreased their preference from 26.3°C to 25.2°C when infected, and this preference was stable over 48h. Furthermore, the decrease in temperature preference was associated with an increased chance of surviving the infection. Nevertheless, the infected temperature preference did not coincide with the optimum temperature for infection survival, which lies at or below 21.4°C. These data suggest that the behavioral response to P. aeruginosa infection is considerably inefficient, and the mechanisms that may account for this pattern are discussed. Future studies of infected temperature preferences should document its efficiency, as this understudied aspect of behavioral immunity can provide important insight into preference evolution.",2016,"Kenneth M Fedorka, Ian C Kutch, Louisa Collins, Edward Musto, Kenneth M Fedorka, Ian C Kutch, Louisa Collins, Edward Musto"
INHIBITION OF FATTY ACID DESATURASES IN Drosophila melanogaster LARVAE BLOCKS FEEDING AND DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRESSION,27037621,10.1002/arch.21329,"Fatty acid desaturases are metabolic setscrews. To study their systemic impact on growth in Drosophila melanogaster, we inhibited fatty acid desaturases using the inhibitor CAY10566. As expected, the amount of desaturated lipids is reduced in larvae fed with CAY10566. These animals cease feeding soon after hatching, and their growth is strongly attenuated. A starvation program is not launched, but the expression of distinct metabolic genes is activated, possibly to mobilize storage material. Without attaining the normal size, inhibitor-fed larvae molt to the next stage indicating that the steroid hormone ecdysone triggers molting correctly. Nevertheless, after molting, expression of ecdysone-dependent regulators is not induced. While control larvae molt a second time, these larvae fail to do so and die after few days of straying. These effects are similar to those observed in experiments using larvae deficient for the fatty acid desaturase1 gene. Based on these data, we propose that the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids adjusts a sensor system that directs feeding behavior. We also hypothesize that loss of fatty acid desaturase activity leads to a block of the genetic program of development progression indirectly by switching on a metabolic compensation program.",2016,"Yiwen Wang, Tina Correia da Cruz, Alicia Pulfemuller, Stéphane Grégoire, Jean-François Ferveur, Bernard Moussian, Yiwen Wang, Tina Correia da Cruz, Alicia Pulfemuller, Stéphane Grégoire, Jean-François Ferveur, Bernard Moussian"
Reconciling Differences in Pool-GWAS Between Populations: A Case Study of Female Abdominal Pigmentation in Drosophila melanogaster,26715669,10.1534/genetics.115.183376,"The degree of concordance between populations in the genetic architecture of a given trait is an important issue in medical and evolutionary genetics. Here, we address this problem, using a replicated pooled genome-wide association study approach (Pool-GWAS) to compare the genetic basis of variation in abdominal pigmentation in female European and South African Drosophila melanogaster. We find that, in both the European and the South African flies, variants near the tan and bric-à-brac 1 (bab1) genes are most strongly associated with pigmentation. However, the relative contribution of these loci differs: in the European populations, tan outranks bab1, while the converse is true for the South African flies. Using simulations, we show that this result can be explained parsimoniously, without invoking different causal variants between the populations, by a combination of frequency differences between the two populations and dominance for the causal alleles at the bab1 locus. Our results demonstrate the power of cost-effective, replicated Pool-GWAS to shed light on differences in the genetic architecture of a given trait between populations.",2016,"Lukas Endler, Andrea J Betancourt, Viola Nolte, Christian Schlötterer, Lukas Endler, Andrea J Betancourt, Viola Nolte, Christian Schlötterer"
The morphogenesis of spermathecae and spermathecal glands in Drosophila melanogaster,23872109,10.1016/j.asd.2013.07.002,"Sperm storage in female insects is important for reproductive success and sperm competition. In Drosophila melanogaster females, sperm viability during storage is dependent upon secretions produced by spermathecae and parovaria. Class III dermal glands are present in both structures. Spermathecal glands are initially comprised of a three-cell unit that is refined to a single secretory cell in the adult. It encapsulates an end-apparatus joining to a cuticular duct passing secretions to the spermathecal lumen. We have examined spermatheca morphogenesis using DIC and fluorescence microscopy. In agreement with a recent study, cell division ceases by 36 h after puparium formation (APF). Immunostaining of the plasma membrane at this stage demonstrates that gland cells wrap around the developing end-apparatus and each other. By 48-60 h APF, the secretory cell exhibits characteristic adult morphology of an enlarged nucleus and extracellular reservoir. A novel finding is the presence of an extracellular reservoir in the basal support cell that is continuous with the secretory cell reservoir. Some indication of early spermathecal gland formation is evident in the division of enlarged cells lying adjacent to the spermathecal lumen at 18 h APF and in cellular processes that bind clusters of cells between 24 and 30 h APF.",2013,"Mark Leonard Mayhew, David John Merritt, Mark Leonard Mayhew, David John Merritt"
Genes required for embryonic muscle development in Drosophila melanogaster A survey of the X chromosome,28306040,10.1007/BF00363217,"We have begun a genetic analysis to dissect the process of myogenesis by surveying the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster for mutations that affect embryonic muscle development. Using polarised light microscopy and antibody staining techniques we analysed embryos hemizygous for a series of 67 deletion mutations that together cover an estimated 85% of the X chromosome, or 16.5% of the genome. Whereas the mature wild type embryo has a regular array of contractile muscles that insert into the epidermis, 31 of the deletion mutants have defects in muscle pattern, contractility or both, that cannot be attributed simply to epidermal defects and identify functions required for wild type muscle development. We have defined mutant pattern phenotypes that can be described in terms of muscle absences, incomplete myoblast fusion, failure of attachment of the muscle to the epidermis or mispositioning of attachment sites. Thus muscle development can be mutationally disrupted in characteristic and interpretable ways. The areas of overlap of the 31 deletions define 19 regions of the X chromosome that include genes whose products are essential for various aspects of myogenesis. We conclude that our screen can usefully identify loci coding for gene products essential in muscle development.",1993,"Rachel Drysdale, Emma Rushton, Michael Bate, Rachel Drysdale, Emma Rushton, Michael Bate"
POLYGENIC MUTATION IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER: ESTIMATES FROM DIVERGENCE AMONG INBRED STRAINS,28564027,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1992.tb02039.x,"A highly inbred line of Drosophila melanogaster was subdivided into 25 replicate sublines, which were independently maintained for 100 generations with 10 pairs of unselected flies per generation. The polygenic mutation rate (VM ) for two quantitative traits, abdominal and sternopleural bristle number, was estimated from divergence among sublines at 10 generation intervals from generations 30-100, and from response of each line to divergent selection after more than 65 generations of mutation accumulation. Estimates of VM averaged over males and females both from divergence among lines and from response to selection within lines were 3.3 × 10-3 VE for abdominal bristles and 1.5 × 10-3 VE for sternopleural bristles, where VE is the environmental variance. The actual rate of production of mutations affecting these traits may be considerably higher if the traits are under stabilizing selection, and if mutations affecting bristle number have deleterious effects on fitness. There was a substantial component of variance for sex × mutant effect interaction and the sublines evolved highly significant mutational variation in sex dimorphism of abdominal bristle number. Pleiotropic effects on sex dimorphism may be a general property of mutations at loci determining bristle number.",1992,"Trudy F C Mackay, Richard F Lyman, Michael S Jackson, Christophe Terzian, William G Hill, Trudy F C Mackay, Richard F Lyman, Michael S Jackson, Christophe Terzian, William G Hill"
Mutagen sensitivity of Drosophila melanogaster. III. X-linked loci governing sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate,189178,10.1007/BF00275962,"Twenty-eight X-linked, recessive mutations of Drosophila melanogaster conferring enhanced sensitivity to the monofunctional alkylating agent, methyl methanesulfonate, have been recoered and assigned to five complementation groups. These groups can be distinguished on the basis of map location and variations in the pattern of mutagen sensitivity. Allelism of members of one complementation group with the previously described meiotic mutant, mei-41, (Baker and Carpenter, 1972) as well as the frequent appearance of female infertility with mutagen sensitivity suggests associated defects in meiotic chromosome behavior or early embryogenesis. Examination of the mutagen sensitivity of double mutants has led to the formulation of a working model of DNA repair for this organism. Studies of a similar nature (Boyd et al., 1976) have identified five additional X chromosome complementation groups, suggesting that the genome of Drosophila melanogaster may contain many loci involved with mutagen sensitivity. The continued isolation and characterization of conditional mutants of this type promises future insights into the mechanisms of DNA replication, DNA repair and recombination in this complex higher eucaryote.",1976,"P D Smith, P D Smith"
Comparisons of yeast florae from natural substrates and larval guts of southwestern Drosophila,28310506,10.1007/BF00363835,"The yeast florae in the natural substrates of four desert and three non-desert Drosophila species were compared both qualitatively and quantatively to the yeast present in the guts of Drosophila larvae living in those substrates.

Larvae of one cactophilic species, D. mojavensis, and larvae of all of the species utilizing oranges (D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, and D. arizonensis) were found to contain non-random samples of the yeasts available in their respective substrates. Larval preference behavior is most likely responsible for these differences. The other cactophilic Drosophila (D. nigrospiracula, D. mettleri, and D. pachea) did not exhibit significant differences when the yeast florae of their larvae and substrates were compared.

However, studies on intraspecific variations of sperm size are very scarce and the number of sperm measured, very limited. This paper investigates within-individual, between-individual and between-population variation of sperm length in the two cosmopolitan species, D. simulans and D. melanogaster. Sperm length distributions are completely discriminated against with these two species, with the mean values equal to 1.121 +/- 0.002 and 1.989 +/- 0.008 mm, respectively. Results of intraspecific variation show a contrasting pattern between the two species. The mode of sperm length distributions is much less variable in D. simulans than in D. melanogaster. The sperm size divergence is unaffected whenever the two species are in sympatry (tested at 'Evolution Canyon', Mount Carmel, Israel) or in allopatry, but the two species react differentially to abiotic local factors. D. melanogaster, in contrast to D. simulans, shows a clinal pattern in sperm size associated with drought.

Modulation of sestrin confers protection to Cr(VI) induced neuronal cell death in Drosophila melanogaster,29045932,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.10.037,"Increased oxidative stress is one of the major causes of hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)], a heavy metal with diverse applications and environmental presence, induced neuronal adversities in exposed organism including Drosophila. Sestrin (sesn), an oxidative stress responsive gene, emerges as a novel player in the management of oxidative stress response. It is reported to be regulated by Target of rapamycin (TOR) and the former regulates autophagy and plays an important role in the prevention of neurodegeneration. Due to limited information regarding the role of sesn in chemical induced cellular adversities, it was hypothesized that modulation of sesn may improve the Cr(VI) induced neuronal adversities in Drosophila. Upon exposure of Cr(VI) (5.0-20.0 μg/ml) to D. melanogaster larvae (w1118; background control), neuronal cell death was observed at 20.0 μg/ml of Cr(VI) concentration which was found to be reversed by targeted sesn overexpression (Elav-GAL4>UAS-sesn) in those cells of exposed organism by the induction of autophagy concomitant with decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, p-Foxo-, p-JNK- and p-Akt-levels with decreased apoptosis. Conversely, after sesn knockdown (Elav-GAL4>UAS-sesnRNAi) in neuronal cells, they become more vulnerable to oxidative stress and apoptosis. Furthermore, knockdown of sesn in neuronal cells of exposed organism resulted in decreased autophagy with increased TOR and p-S6k levels while overexpression of sesn led to their decreased levels suggestive of decreased anabolic and increased catabolic activity in neuronal cells shifting energy towards the augmentation of cellular repair. Taken together, the study suggests therapeutic implications of sesn against chemical induced neuronal adversities in an organism.",2018,"Pallavi Singh, D Kar Chowdhuri, Pallavi Singh, D Kar Chowdhuri"
Sperm-Leucylaminopeptidases are required for male fertility as structural components of mitochondrial paracrystalline material in Drosophila melanogaster sperm,30802236,10.1371/journal.pgen.1007987,"Drosophila melanogaster sperm reach an extraordinary long size, 1.8 mm, by the end of spermatogenesis. The mitochondrial derivatives run along the entire flagellum and provide structural rigidity for flagellar movement, but its precise function and organization is incompletely understood. The two mitochondrial derivatives differentiate and by the end of spermatogenesis the minor one reduces its size and the major one accumulates paracrystalline material inside it. The molecular constituents and precise function of the paracrystalline material have not yet been revealed. Here we purified the paracrystalline material from mature sperm and identified by mass spectrometry Sperm-Leucylaminopeptidase (S-Lap) family members as important constituents of it. To study the function of S-Lap proteins we show the characterization of classical mutants and RNAi lines affecting of the S-Lap genes and the analysis of their mutant phenotypes. We show that the male sterile phenotype of the S-Lap mutants is caused by defects in paracrystalline material accumulation and abnormal structure of the elongated major mitochondrial derivatives. Our work shows that S-Lap proteins localize and accumulate in the paracrystalline material of the major mitochondrial derivative.

"Origin, evolution, and population genetics of the selfish Segregation Distorter gene duplication in European and African populations of Drosophila melanogaster",25828399,10.1111/evo.12658,"Meiotic drive elements are a special class of evolutionarily ""selfish genes"" that subvert Mendelian segregation to gain preferential transmission at the expense of homologous loci. Many drive elements appear to be maintained in populations as stable polymorphisms, their equilibrium frequencies determined by the balance between drive (increasing frequency) and selection (decreasing frequency). Here we show that a classic, seemingly balanced, drive system is instead characterized by frequent evolutionary turnover giving rise to dynamic, rather than stable, equilibrium frequencies. The autosomal Segregation Distorter (SD) system of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a selfish coadapted meiotic drive gene complex in which the major driver corresponds to a partial duplication of the gene Ran-GTPase activating protein (RanGAP). SD chromosomes segregate at similar, low frequencies of 1-5% in natural populations worldwide, consistent with a balanced polymorphism. Surprisingly, our population genetic analyses reveal evidence for parallel, independent selective sweeps of different SD chromosomes in populations on different continents. These findings suggest that, rather than persisting at a single stable equilibrium, SD chromosomes turn over frequently within populations.",2015,"Cara L Brand, Amanda M Larracuente, Daven C Presgraves, Cara L Brand, Amanda M Larracuente, Daven C Presgraves"
Experimental evolution of female traits under different levels of intersexual conflict in Drosophila melanogaster,24117169,10.1111/evo.12271,"A number of studies have documented the evolution of female resistance to mate-harm in response to the alteration of intersexual conflict in the populations. However, the life-history consequence of such evolution is still a subject of debate. In this study, we subjected replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster to different levels of sexual conflict (generated by altering the operational sex ratio) for over 45 generations. Our results suggest that females from populations experiencing higher level of intersexual conflict evolved increased resistance to mate-harm, in terms of both longevity and progeny production. Females from the populations with low conflict were significantly heavier at eclosion and were more susceptible to mate-harm in terms of progeny production under continuous exposure to the males. However, these females produced more progeny upon single mating and had significantly higher longevity in absence of any male exposure-a potential evidence of trade-offs between resistance-related traits and other life-history traits, such as fecundity and longevity. We also report tentative evidence, suggesting an increased male cost of interacting with more resistant females.",2014,"B Nandy, V Gupta, N Udaykumar, M A Samant, S Sen, N G Prasad, B Nandy, V Gupta, N Udaykumar, M A Samant, S Sen, N G Prasad"
Lutein extends the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster,23993264,10.1016/j.archger.2013.07.007,"Lutein is one of the major carotenoids in most fruits and vegetables. The effect of lutein on the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster was investigated. Results revealed that 0.1mg lutein/ml diet could prolong their mean lifespan from 49.0 to 54.6 days. This was consistent with a significant reduction in malonyldialdehyde (MDA) level and increase in antioxidant enzyme activities of the flies fed with lutein-treated diet compared with those fed with basal diet. Paraquat (PQ) and H2O2 treatment tests demonstrated that lutein could prolong the survival time of the flies. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis indicated the gene expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD; SOD1 and SOD2), and catalase (CAT) in the lutein-treated group was up-regulated relative to that of the control group.

Targeting of Painting of fourth to roX1 and roX2 proximal sites suggests evolutionary links between dosage compensation and the regulation of the fourth chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster,23733888,10.1534/g3.113.006866,"In Drosophila melanogaster, two chromosome-specific targeting and regulatory systems have been described. The male-specific lethal (MSL) complex supports dosage compensation by stimulating gene expression from the male X-chromosome, and the protein Painting of fourth (POF) specifically targets and stimulates expression from the heterochromatic 4(th) chromosome. The targeting sites of both systems are well characterized, but the principles underlying the targeting mechanisms have remained elusive. Here we present an original observation, namely that POF specifically targets two loci on the X-chromosome, PoX1 and PoX2 (POF-on-X). PoX1 and PoX2 are located close to the roX1 and roX2 genes, which encode noncoding RNAs important for the correct targeting and spreading of the MSL-complex. We also found that the targeting of POF to PoX1 and PoX2 is largely dependent on roX expression and identified a high-affinity target region that ectopically recruits POF. The results presented support a model linking the MSL-complex to POF and dosage compensation to regulation of heterochromatin.",2013,"Lina E Lundberg, Maria Kim, Anna-Mia Johansson, Marie-Line Faucillion, Rafael Josupeit, Jan Larsson, Lina E Lundberg, Maria Kim, Anna-Mia Johansson, Marie-Line Faucillion, Rafael Josupeit, Jan Larsson"
Identification of a cis-regulatory element required for 20-hydroxyecdysone enhancement of antimicrobial peptide gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster,19754738,10.1111/j.1365-2583.2009.00901.x,"The antimicrobial peptide diptericin plays an important role in defence against microorganisms. Drosophila melanogaster diptericin mRNA levels showed an increase during the late final instar larval stage when the ecdysteroid titres increase to initiate metamorphosis. Deletion analysis in Drosophila melanogaster mbn2 (mbn2) cells identified a cis-regulatory element (AAGAAAGATCCCCTG) necessary for 20-hydroxyecdysone enhancement of peptidoglycan-induced expression of diptericin in the 3 kb diptericin promoter. Proteins extracted from mbn2 cells treated with peptidoglycan plus 20-hydroxyecdysone specifically bound to this element. 20-hydroxyecdysone also enhanced peptidoglycan-induced expression of four other antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes--drosomycin, attacin-A, metchnikowin and cecropin A1. Moreover, in silico promoter analysis using the meme program showed that an eight-nucleotide region of the identified cis-regulatory element is present in the promoters of these four AMP genes.

Virus-like particle formation in Drosophila melanogaster germ cells suggests a complex translational regulation of the retrotransposon cycle and new mechanisms inhibiting transposition,16093726,10.1159/000085675,"Transposition of 1731, a Drosophila melanogaster LTR retrotransposon, was investigated in reproductive organs by RNA, protein and VLP distribution during its life cycle. We detected 1731 transcription in oogonia but not in spermatogonia; in all cells during oogenesis but only in primary spermatocytes; and in ovarian cytoplasm but both in nuclei and cytoplasm of primary spermatocytes. By confocal scanning, we showed that whereas Gag protein appeared in all cytoplasms during oogenesis, in testes Gag detection began in late premeiotic primary spermatocytes and increased in elongating spermatids suggesting distinct mechanisms of 1731 transcription and translation regulation. By electron microscopy, we did not detect 1731 VLPs in ovaries, suggesting a complex post-translational control blocking VLP assembly and transposition. Interestingly, in testes we discovered VLP aggregates in cystic cytoplasm of maturing partially individualized spermatids. In testes, we observed two delays in 1731 product expressions, suggesting a complex temporal control mechanism. Transcriptional/translational delay may be determined by accumulation of 1731 RNAs in primary spermatocyte nuclei. Translational/VLP assembly delay may be determined by post-transductional mechanisms controlling +1 frameshift and Pol-protein degradation. Our results indicated two differential mechanisms inhibiting 1731 transposition in Drosophila melanogaster ovaries and testes.

The results showed that the multi-micronutrient could significantly increase the survival rate of heat-exposed Drosophila melanogaster and prolong the survival time and swimming time of mice under high temperature. The results indicated that the significant influence of multi-micronutrients on heat adaptation could be the result of enhancing the glucocorticoid receptor activity in hepatic cytosol in the heat-exposed rats, inhibiting liver phospholipase A2 activity in the heat-exposed rats, increasing serum SOD activity and decreasing serum MAD content in the heat-exposed rats, as well as increasing level of HSP70 in the heat-exposed Drosophila melanogaster.

RAPID LABORATORY EVOLUTION OF ADULT LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER IN RESPONSE TO TEMPERATURE,28565092,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1995.tb02285.x,"Three replicate lines of Drosophila melanogaster were cultured at each of two temperatures (16.5°C and 25°C) in population cages for 4 yr. The lifespans of both sexes and the fecundity and fertility of the females were then measured at both experimental temperatures. The characters showed evidence of adaptation; flies of both sexes from each selection regime showed higher longevity, and females showed higher fecundity and fertility, than flies from the other selection regime when they were tested at the experimental temperature at which they had evolved. Calculation of intrinsic rates of increase under different assumptions about the rate of population increase showed that the difference between the lines from the two selection regimes became less the higher the rate of population increase, because the lines were more similar in early adulthood than they were later. Despite the increased adaptation of the low-temperature lines to the low temperature, like the high temperature lines they produced progeny at a higher rate at the higher temperature. The lines may have independently evolved adaptations to their respective thermal regimes during the experiment, or there may have been a trade-off between adaptation to the two temperatures, or mutation pressure may have lowered adaptation to the temperature that the flies no longer encountered.",1995,"Linda Partridge, Brian Barrie, Nicholas H Barton, Kevin Fowler, Vernon French, Linda Partridge, Brian Barrie, Nicholas H Barton, Kevin Fowler, Vernon French"

The compound was administered to adult males by oral application.

Procarbazine is highly mutagenic in causing recessive lethal mutations in all stages of spermatogenesis. In sperm a clear-cut concentration-effect relationship is not apparent, but in spermatids such a relationship is obtained for mutation induction at low levels of procarbazine exposure, while at high concentrations the induction of recessive lethals is not a function of concentration. A low induction of total sex-chromosome loss (X,Y) and dominant lethals was observed in metabolically active germ cells (spermatids), but procarbazine failed to produce well-defined breakage events, such as partial sex-chromosome loss (YL,YS) and II-III translocations.

Insulin-Like Signalling Influences the Coordination of Larval Hemocyte Number with Body Size in Drosophila melanogaster,32341056,10.1534/g3.120.401313,"Blood cells, known as hemocytes in invertebrates, play important and conserved roles in immunity, wound healing and tissue remodelling. The control of hemocyte number is therefore critical to ensure these functions are not compromised, and studies using Drosophila melanogaster are proving useful for understanding how this occurs. Recently, the embryonic patterning gene, torso-like (tsl), was identified as being required both for normal hemocyte development and for providing immunity against certain pathogens. Here, we report that Tsl is required specifically during the larval phase of hematopoiesis, and that tsl mutant larvae likely have reduced hemocyte numbers due to a reduced larval growth rate and compromised insulin signaling. Consistent with this, we find that impairing insulin-mediated growth, either by nutrient deprivation or genetically, results in fewer hemocytes. This is likely the result of impaired insulin-like signaling in the hemocytes themselves, since modulation of Insulin-like Receptor (InR) activity specifically in hemocytes causes concomitant changes to their population size in developing larvae. Taken together, our work reveals the strong relationship that exists between body size and hemocyte number, and suggests that insulin-like signaling contributes to, but is not solely responsible for, keeping these tightly aligned during larval development.",2020,"Daniel Bakopoulos, Lauren Forbes Beadle, Katherine M Esposito, Christen K Mirth, Coral G Warr, Travis K Johnson, Daniel Bakopoulos, Lauren Forbes Beadle, Katherine M Esposito, Christen K Mirth, Coral G Warr, Travis K Johnson"
Mating rhythms of Drosophila: rescue of tim01 mutants by D. ananassae timeless,16522214,10.1186/1740-3391-4-4,"Background:
      
    

    
      It is reported that the circadian rhythms of female mating activity differ among Drosophila species and are controlled by an endogenous circadian clock. Here, we found that the mating rhythm of D. ananassae differed from that of D. melanogaster. Moreover, to evaluate the effect of clock gene products on mating activities, we examined the mating activity of D. melanogaster timeless (tim01) transgenic fly harboring heat-shock promotor driven-D. ananassae timeless (tim) gene (hs-AT tim01).
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Flies were maintained under light/dark (LD) cycles for several days and then they were transferred to constant dark (DD) conditions at 25 degrees C. Transformant flies were heat-shocked for 30 min (PZT 10.5-11.0 or PZT 22.5-23.0; PZT means Projected Zeitgeber Time) at 37 degrees C every day. Daily expressions of D. ananassae TIMELESS (TIM) protein in transgenic flies were measured by western blotting. To examine whether the timing of D. ananassae TIM protein induction by heat shock can change the patterns of the behavior activities of D. melanogaster tim01 flies, we measured locomotor and mating activity rhythms under DD at 25 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C except when heat shock was applied.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Heat shock applied at PZT 10.5-11.0 and at PZT 22.5-23.0 induced high TIM levels during subjective night and day, respectively, in hs-AT tim01 flies. The locomotor rhythm of these flies was changed from diurnal to nocturnal by the timing of D. ananassae TIM induction. However, the mating rhythm of these flies could not be entrained by the timing of D. ananassae TIM induction.

The mating activity rhythms of D. melanogaster tim01 flies harboring hs-AT tim appeared after heat-shock but the pattern and phase differed from those of wild-type D. ananassae and D. melanogaster. Moreover, the mating rhythm of these flies could not be entrained by the timing of D. ananassae TIM induction although the locomotor rhythm of hs-AT tim01 was changed from diurnal to nocturnal according to the timing of D. ananassae TIM induction.

Correspondingly, Wolbachia infection also reduced the arousal threshold of their fly hosts. However, neither circadian rhythm nor sleep rebound following deprivation was influenced by Wolbachia infection. Transcriptional analysis of the dopamine biosynthesis pathway revealed that two essential genes, Pale and Ddc, were significantly upregulated in Wolbachia-infected flies. Together, these results indicate that Wolbachia mediates the expression of dopamine related genes, and decreases the sleep quality of their insect hosts. Our findings help better understand the host-endosymbiont interactions and in particular the Wolbachia's impact on behaviors, and thus on ecology and evolution in insect hosts.",2018,"Jie Bi, Amita Sehgal, Julie A Williams, Yu-Feng Wang, Jie Bi, Amita Sehgal, Julie A Williams, Yu-Feng Wang"
Key Odorants Regulate Food Attraction in Drosophila melanogaster,28928642,10.3389/fnbeh.2017.00160,"In insects, the search for food is highly dependent on olfactory sensory input. Here, we investigated whether a single key odorant within an odor blend or the complexity of the odor blend influences the attraction of Drosophila melanogaster to a food source. A key odorant is defined as an odorant that elicits a difference in the behavioral response when two similar complex odor blends are offered. To validate that the observed behavioral responses were elicited by olfactory stimuli, we used olfactory co-receptor Orco mutants. We show that within a food odor blend, ethanol functions as a key odorant. In addition to ethanol other odorants might serve as key odorants at specific concentrations. However, not all odorants are key odorants. The intensity of the odor background influences the attractiveness of the key odorants. Increased complexity is only more attractive in a concentration-dependent range for single compounds in a blend. Orco is necessary to discriminate between two similarly attractive odorants when offered as single odorants and in food odor blends, supporting the importance of single odorant recognition in odor blends. These data strongly indicate that flies use more than one strategy to navigate to a food odor source, depending on the availability of key odorants in the odor blend and the alternative odor offered.",2017,"Thomas Giang, Jianzheng He, Safaa Belaidi, Henrike Scholz, Thomas Giang, Jianzheng He, Safaa Belaidi, Henrike Scholz"
Genome-Wide RNAi Screens for RNA Processing Events in Drosophila melanogaster S2 Cells,28766301,10.1007/978-1-4939-7204-3_17,"Over the past 10 years, the design and application of genome-wide screening (GWS) has improved to the point that it can now be done at level of the individual laboratory. The advantages of GWSs compared to classical genetic screens include: immediate identification of a positive scoring gene, relatively short period of time necessary to conduct the screen (as little as 1 week), cell lines do not present developmental needs for gene expression that an organism normally would, and validation/confirmation of results is straightforward. Here, we describe a general protocol for GWS to be conducted in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. We provide specific details on what type of experiments must be done before initiating a screen, the materials that are required to conduct a screen, and make suggestions on methods to carry out secondary screening and counter-screening once the initial GWS is complete. Multiple considerations are also raised that focus on how to anticipate false positives/negatives and how to minimize their occurrence through intelligent design. Finally, we provide specific examples of data that our group has gathered from published genome-wide screens in order to exemplify how ""hits"" are scored and confirmed.",2017,"Natoya Peart, Eric J Wagner, Natoya Peart, Eric J Wagner"
Selection on Inversion Breakpoints Favors Proximity to Pairing Sensitive Sites in Drosophila melanogaster,27343234,10.1534/genetics.116.190389,"Chromosomal inversions are widespread among taxa, and have been implicated in a number of biological processes including adaptation, sex chromosome evolution, and segregation distortion. Consistent with selection favoring linkage between loci, it is well established that length is a selected trait of inversions. However, the factors that affect the distribution of inversion breakpoints remain poorly understood. ""Sensitive sites"" have been mapped on all euchromatic chromosome arms in Drosophila melanogaster, and may be a source of natural selection on inversion breakpoint positions. Briefly, sensitive sites are genomic regions wherein proximal structural rearrangements result in large reductions in local recombination rates in heterozygotes. Here, I show that breakpoints of common inversions are significantly more likely to lie within a cytological band containing a sensitive site than are breakpoints of rare inversions. Furthermore, common inversions for which neither breakpoint intersects a sensitive site are significantly longer than rare inversions, but common inversions whose breakpoints intersect a sensitive site show no evidence for increased length. I interpret these results to mean that selection favors inversions whose breakpoints disrupt synteny near to sensitive sites, possibly because these inversions suppress recombination in large genomic regions. To my knowledge this is the first evidence consistent with positive selection acting on inversion breakpoint positions.",2016,"Russell B Corbett-Detig, Russell B Corbett-Detig"
Modulating effect of simvastatin on the DNA damage induced by doxorubicin in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,26829615,10.1016/j.fct.2016.01.022,"Simvastatin is an antilipemic drug that promotes inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Simvastatin can also inhibit the formation of other products, such as isoprenoids, conferring additional benefits to this drug, which include antiproliferative, anti-invasive and pro-apoptotic effects. This study was carried out with the aim of evaluating the mutagenic/recombinogenic effect of simvastatin as well as the possible modulatory effects of this statin on the DNA damage induced by doxorubicin (DXR). This analysis was performed using the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster. To study these effects, larvae descendants of both crosses (ST and HB) were chronically treated with five concentrations of simvastatin, separately and in association with DXR. The results revealed no mutagenic/recombinogenic effect of simvastatin for any of the concentrations tested. A modulating effect of simvastatin was also observed on DNA damage induced by DXR. The reduction of total mutant frequency was observed for spots from descendants of both crosses, but the inhibition was more effective in descendants from the standard cross (ST). It is believed that this modulating effect is mainly associated with the antioxidant activity of this class of drugs, although this parameter has not been directly assessed in this study.",2016,"P C Orsolin, R G Silva-Oliveira, J C Nepomuceno, P C Orsolin, R G Silva-Oliveira, J C Nepomuceno"

Since in vivo studies produce relevant information complementing in vitro data, we promote the use of Drosophila melanogaster as a suitable in vivo model to detect toxic and genotoxic effects associated with CdSe QD exposure. Taking into account the potential release of cadmium ions, QD effects were compared with those obtained with CdCl2. Results showed that CdSe QDs penetrate the intestinal barrier of the larvae reaching the hemolymph, interacting with hemocytes, and inducing dose/time dependent significant genotoxic effects, as determined by the comet assay. Elevated ROS production, QD biodegradation, and significant disturbance in the conserved Hsps, antioxidant and p53 genes were also observed. Overall, QD effects were milder than those induced by CdCl2 suggesting the role of Cd released ions in the observed harmful effects of Cd based QDs.

Virulent bacterial infection improves aversive learning performance in Drosophila melanogaster,24863366,10.1016/j.bbi.2014.05.008,"Virulent infections are expected to impair learning ability, either as a direct consequence of stressed physiological state or as an adaptive response that minimizes diversion of energy from immune defense. This prediction has been well supported for mammals and bees. Here, we report an opposite result in Drosophila melanogaster. Using an odor-mechanical shock conditioning paradigm, we found that intestinal infection with bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas entomophila or Erwinia c. carotovora improved flies' learning performance after a 1h retention interval. Infection with P. entomophila (but not E. c. carotovora) also improved learning performance after 5 min retention. No effect on learning performance was detected for intestinal infections with an avirulent GacA mutant of P. entomophila or for virulent systemic (hemocoel) infection with E. c. carotovora. Assays of unconditioned responses to odorants and shock do not support a major role for changes in general responsiveness to stimuli in explaining the changes in learning performance, although differences in their specific salience for learning cannot be excluded. Our results demonstrate that the effects of pathogens on learning performance in insects are less predictable than suggested by previous studies, and support the notion that immune stress can sometimes boost cognitive abilities.",2014,"Aurélie Babin, Sylvain Kolly, Tadeusz J Kawecki, Aurélie Babin, Sylvain Kolly, Tadeusz J Kawecki"
Inbreeding reveals mode of past selection on male reproductive characters in Drosophila melanogaster,23919154,10.1002/ece3.625,"Directional dominance is a prerequisite of inbreeding depression. Directionality arises when selection drives alleles that increase fitness to fixation and eliminates dominant deleterious alleles, while deleterious recessives are hidden from it and maintained at low frequencies. Traits under directional selection (i.e., fitness traits) are expected to show directional dominance and therefore an increased susceptibility to inbreeding depression. In contrast, traits under stabilizing selection or weakly linked to fitness are predicted to exhibit little-to-no inbreeding depression. Here, we quantify the extent of inbreeding depression in a range of male reproductive characters and then infer the mode of past selection on them. The use of transgenic populations of Drosophila melanogaster with red or green fluorescent-tagged sperm heads permitted in vivo discrimination of sperm from competing males and quantification of characteristics of ejaculate composition, performance, and fate. We found that male attractiveness (mating latency) and competitive fertilization success (P2) both show some inbreeding depression, suggesting they may have been under directional selection, whereas sperm length showed no inbreeding depression suggesting a history of stabilizing selection. However, despite having measured several sperm quality and quantity traits, our data did not allow us to discern the mechanism underlying the lowered competitive fertilization success of inbred (f = 0.50) males.",2013,"Outi Ala-Honkola, David J Hosken, Mollie K Manier, Stefan Lüpold, Elizabeth M Droge-Young, Kirstin S Berben, William F Collins, John M Belote, Scott Pitnick, Outi Ala-Honkola, David J Hosken, Mollie K Manier, Stefan Lüpold, Elizabeth M Droge-Young, Kirstin S Berben, William F Collins, John M Belote, Scott Pitnick"

Determination of the shape of the operculum by the bithorax complex in Drosophila melanogaster,28306056,10.1007/BF00376064,"We have studied the course of the operculum line in the larval hypoderm of several bithorax complex mutants of Drosophila melanogaster. The bifurcation of the line, a characteristic of the first abdominal segment in wild-type (A1), can also appear in the metathoracic (T3) and other abdominal segments (A2, A3) depending on mutations within the bithorax complex. Therefore, we concluded that the course of the operculum line and thus the shape of the operculum is not determined by a suprasegmental gradient of positional information but by the functional state of the genes of the bithorax complex in each metamere. The dorsal and ventral branches of the operculum line react differently, the dorsal branch being more sensitive to the effect of loss of function mutations (bxd, iab-2 k), the ventral branch more affected by gain of function mutations (Hab). In some cases the effects of the mutations on the operculum line differed from those in the adult, suggesting a difference in sensitivity of larval hypodermal cells and histoblast cells to the functional gene products of the bithorax complex.",1986,"T E Spreij, D Segal, T E Spreij, D Segal"

Conserved genomic organisation of Group B Sox genes in insects,15943880,10.1186/1471-2156-6-26,"Background:
      
    

    
      Sox domain containing genes are important metazoan transcriptional regulators implicated in a wide rage of developmental processes. The vertebrate B subgroup contains the Sox1, Sox2 and Sox3 genes that have early functions in neural development. Previous studies show that Drosophila Group B genes have been functionally conserved since they play essential roles in early neural specification and mutations in the Drosophila Dichaete and SoxN genes can be rescued with mammalian Sox genes. Despite their importance, the extent and organisation of the Group B family in Drosophila has not been fully characterised, an important step in using Drosophila to examine conserved aspects of Group B Sox gene function.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We have used the directed cDNA sequencing along with the output from the publicly-available genome sequencing projects to examine the structure of Group B Sox domain genes in Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura, Anopheles gambiae and Apis mellifora. All of the insect genomes contain four genes encoding Group B proteins, two of which are intronless, as is the case with vertebrate group B genes. As has been previously reported and unusually for Group B genes, two of the insect group B genes, Sox21a and Sox21b, contain introns within their DNA-binding domains. We find that the highly unusual multi-exon structure of the Sox21b gene is common to the insects. In addition, we find that three of the group B Sox genes are organised in a linked cluster in the insect genomes. By in situ hybridisation we show that the pattern of expression of each of the four group B genes during embryogenesis is conserved between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The DNA-binding domain sequences and genomic organisation of the group B genes have been conserved over 300 My of evolution since the last common ancestor of the Hymenoptera and the Diptera. Our analysis suggests insects have two Group B1 genes, SoxN and Dichaete, and two Group B2 genes. The genomic organisation of Dichaete and another two Group B genes in a cluster, suggests they may be under concerted regulatory control. Our analysis suggests a simple model for the evolution of group B Sox genes in insects that differs from the proposed evolution of vertebrate Group B genes.",2005,"Carol McKimmie, Gertrud Woerfel, Steven Russell, Carol McKimmie, Gertrud Woerfel, Steven Russell"
Microbiome composition shapes rapid genomic adaptation of Drosophila melanogaster,31527278,10.1073/pnas.1907787116,"Population genomic data has revealed patterns of genetic variation associated with adaptation in many taxa. Yet understanding the adaptive process that drives such patterns is challenging; it requires disentangling the ecological agents of selection, determining the relevant timescales over which evolution occurs, and elucidating the genetic architecture of adaptation. Doing so for the adaptation of hosts to their microbiome is of particular interest with growing recognition of the importance and complexity of host-microbe interactions. Here, we track the pace and genomic architecture of adaptation to an experimental microbiome manipulation in replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster in field mesocosms. Shifts in microbiome composition altered population dynamics and led to divergence between treatments in allele frequencies, with regions showing strong divergence found on all chromosomes. Moreover, at divergent loci previously associated with adaptation across natural populations, we found that the more common allele in fly populations experimentally enriched for a certain microbial group was also more common in natural populations with high relative abundance of that microbial group. These results suggest that microbiomes may be an agent of selection that shapes the pattern and process of adaptation and, more broadly, that variation in a single ecological factor within a complex environment can drive rapid, polygenic adaptation over short timescales.",2019,"Seth M Rudman, Sharon Greenblum, Rachel C Hughes, Subhash Rajpurohit, Ozan Kiratli, Dallin B Lowder, Skyler G Lemmon, Dmitri A Petrov, John M Chaston, Paul Schmidt, Seth M Rudman, Sharon Greenblum, Rachel C Hughes, Subhash Rajpurohit, Ozan Kiratli, Dallin B Lowder, Skyler G Lemmon, Dmitri A Petrov, John M Chaston, Paul Schmidt"
A Variable Genetic Architecture of Melanic Evolution in Drosophila melanogaster,27638419,10.1534/genetics.116.192492,"Unraveling the genetic architecture of adaptive phenotypic divergence is a fundamental quest in evolutionary biology. In Drosophila melanogaster, high-altitude melanism has evolved in separate mountain ranges in sub-Saharan Africa, potentially as an adaptation to UV intensity. We investigated the genetic basis of this melanism in three populations using a new bulk segregant analysis mapping method. We identified 19 distinct QTL regions from nine mapping crosses, with several QTL peaks overlapping between two or all populations, and yet different crosses involving the same melanic population commonly yielded distinct QTL. The strongest QTL often overlapped well-known pigmentation genes, but we typically did not find wide signals of genetic differentiation (FST) between lightly and darkly pigmented populations at these genes. Instead, we found small numbers of highly differentiated SNPs at the probable causative genes. A simulation analysis showed that these patterns of polymorphism were consistent with selection on standing genetic variation. Overall, our results suggest that, even for potentially simpler traits like pigmentation, the complexity of adaptive trait evolution poses important challenges for QTL mapping and population genetic analysis.",2016,"Héloïse Bastide, Jeremy D Lange, Justin B Lack, Amir Yassin, John E Pool, Héloïse Bastide, Jeremy D Lange, Justin B Lack, Amir Yassin, John E Pool"
The Pyrexia transient receptor potential channel mediates circadian clock synchronization to low temperature cycles in Drosophila melanogaster,23926145,10.1098/rspb.2013.0959,"Circadian clocks are endogenous approximately 24 h oscillators that temporally regulate many physiological and behavioural processes. In order to be beneficial for the organism, these clocks must be synchronized with the environmental cycles on a daily basis. Both light : dark and the concomitant daily temperature cycles (TCs) function as Zeitgeber ('time giver') and efficiently entrain circadian clocks. The temperature receptors mediating this synchronization have not been identified. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels function as thermo-receptors in animals, and here we show that the Pyrexia (Pyx) TRP channel mediates temperature synchronization in Drosophila melanogaster. Pyx is expressed in peripheral sensory organs (chordotonal organs), which previously have been implicated in temperature synchronization. Flies deficient for Pyx function fail to synchronize their behaviour to TCs in the lower range (16-20°C), and this deficit can be partially rescued by introducing a wild-type copy of the pyx gene. Synchronization to higher TCs is not affected, demonstrating a specific role for Pyx at lower temperatures. In addition, pyx mutants speed up their clock after being exposed to TCs. Our results identify the first TRP channel involved in temperature synchronization of circadian clocks.",2013,"Werner Wolfgang, Alekos Simoni, Carla Gentile, Ralf Stanewsky, Werner Wolfgang, Alekos Simoni, Carla Gentile, Ralf Stanewsky"
Reproductive status alters transcriptomic response to infection in female Drosophila melanogaster,23550122,10.1534/g3.112.005306,"Mating and consequent reproduction significantly reduce the ability of female Drosophila melanogaster to defend against systemic bacterial infection. The goal of the present study was to identify genes likely to inform the mechanism of this post-mating immunosuppression. We used microarrays to contrast genome-wide transcript levels in virgin vs. mated females before and after infection. Because the immunosuppressive effect of mating is contingent on the presence of a germline in females, we repeated the entire experiment by using female mutants that do not form a germline. We found that multiple genes involved in egg production show reduced expression in response to infection, and that this reduction is stronger in virgins than it is in mated females. In germline-less females, expression of egg-production genes was predictably low and not differentially affected by infection. We also identified several immune responsive genes that are differentially induced after infection in virgins vs. mated females. Immune genes affected by mating status and egg production genes altered by infection are candidates to inform the mechanism of the trade-off between mating and immune defense.",2013,"Sarah M Short, Brian P Lazzaro, Sarah M Short, Brian P Lazzaro"

In response to heat stress, Hsp27 is expressed in all cells of the ommatidium including the cone, pigment and photoreceptor cells. However, the heat-induced expression of Hsp23 is restricted to a single cell type of the ommatidium, the cone cells, suggesting that Hsp23 is regulated by specific mechanisms acting to inhibit the expression of this polypeptide in some ommatidial cells. The cell-specific induction of Hsp23 under stress conditions does not seem to be regulated by the Drosophila melanogaster heat shock transcriptional factor (DmHSF). In both unstressed and stressed conditions, DmHSF is detected in all the different types of ommatidial cells where it is found associated with the nucleus.

I factors in Drosophila melanogaster: transposition under control,7813907,10.1007/BF01435243,"I factors are responsible for the I-R system of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. They belong to the LINE class of mobile elements, which transpose via reverse transcription of a full-length RNA intermediate. I factors are active members of the I element family, which also contains defective I elements that are immobilized within peri-centromeric heterochromatin and represent very old components of the genome. Active I factors have recently invaded natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster, giving rise to inducer strains. Reactive strains, devoid of active I factors, derive from old laboratory stocks established before the invasion. Transposition of I factors is activated at very high frequencies in the germline of hybrid females issued from crosses between females from reactive strains and males from inducer strains. It results in the production of high rates of mutations and chromosomal rearrangements as well as in a particular syndrome of sterility. The frequency of transposition of I factors is dependent on the amount of full-length RNA that is synthesized from an internal promoter. This full-length RNA serves both as an intermediate of transposition and presumably as a messenger for protein synthesis. Regulators of transposition apparently affect transcription initiation from the internal promoter. The data presented here lead to the proposal of a tentative model for transposition.",1994,"I Busseau, M C Chaboissier, A Pélisson, A Bucheton, I Busseau, M C Chaboissier, A Pélisson, A Bucheton"

We have previously established an anesthetic-resistant mutant strain, Eth-29, of Drosophila melanogaster. Eth-29 is resistant to diethylether, chloroform and halothane. The anesthetic-resistant strain was found to be radiosensitive when evaluated by survival at the eighth day after irradiation or by dyskinesia (knock-down) at the second day. The results indicate that anesthetic resistance may be related to an increase in orderliness. The findings in reciprocal crosses between Eth-29 and the control strain indicate that the mechanism of survival is different from that of knock-down.

Chitosan/siRNA nanoparticle targeting demonstrates a requirement for single-minded during larval and pupal olfactory system development of the vector mosquito Aedes aegypti,24552425,10.1186/1471-213X-14-9,"Background:
      
    

    
      Essentially nothing is known about the genetic regulation of olfactory system development in vector mosquitoes, which use olfactory cues to detect blood meal hosts. Studies in Drosophila melanogaster have identified a regulatory matrix of transcription factors that controls pupal/adult odorant receptor (OR) gene expression in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). However, it is unclear if transcription factors that function in the D. melanogaster regulatory matrix are required for OR expression in mosquitoes. Furthermore, the regulation of OR expression during development of the larval olfactory system, which is far less complex than that of pupae/adults, is not well understood in any insect, including D. melanogaster. Here, we examine the regulation of OR expression in the developing larval olfactory system of Aedes aegypti, the dengue vector mosquito.

Consensus binding sites for Single-minded (Sim) are located adjacent to over half the A. aegypti OR genes, suggesting that this transcription factor functions as a major regulator of mosquito OR expression. To functionally test this hypothesis, chitosan/siRNA nanoparticles were used to target sim during larval olfactory development. These experiments demonstrated that Sim positively regulates expression of a large subset of OR genes, including orco, the obligate co-receptor in the assembly and function of heteromeric OR/Orco complexes. Decreased innervation of the antennal lobe was also noted in sim knockdown larvae. These OR expression and antennal lobe defects correlated with a larval odorant tracking behavioral defect. OR expression and antennal lobe defects were also observed in sim knockdown pupae.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:

Re-analysis of the larval testis data on meiotic sex chromosome inactivation revealed evidence for tissue-specific gene expression related to the drosophila X chromosome,22691264,10.1186/1741-7007-10-49,"Background:
      
    

    
      Meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) during spermatogenesis has been proposed as one of the evolutionary driving forces behind both the under-representation of male-biased genes on, and the gene movement out of, the X chromosome in Drosophila. However, the relevance of MSCI in shaping sex chromosome evolution is controversial. Here we examine two aspects of a recent study on testis gene expression (Mikhaylova and Nurminsky, BMC Biol 2011, 9:29) that failed to support the MSCI in Drosophila. First, Mikhaylova and Nurminsky found no differences between X-linked and autosomal genes based on the transcriptional profiling of the early testis development, and thus concluded that MSCI does not occur in D. melanogaster. Second, they also analyzed expression data from several D. melanogaster tissues and concluded that under-representation on the X chromosome is not an exclusive property of testis-biased genes, but instead, a general property of tissue-specific genes.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      By re-analyzing the Mikhaylova and Nurminsky's testis data and the expression data on several D. melanogaster tissues, we made two major findings that refuted their original claims. First, the developmental testis data has generally greater experimental error than conventional analyses, which reduced significantly the power to detect chromosomal differences in expression. Nevertheless, our re-analysis observed significantly lower expression of the X chromosome in the genomic transcriptomes of later development stages of the testis, which is consistent with the MSCI hypothesis. Second, tissue-specific genes are also in general enriched with genes more expressed in testes than in ovaries, that is testis-biased genes. By completely excluding from the analyses the testis-biased genes, which are known to be under-represented in the X, we found that all the other tissue-specific genes are randomly distributed between the X chromosome and the autosomes.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our findings negate the original study of Mikhaylova and Nurminsky, which concluded a lack of MSCI and generalized the pattern of paucity in the X chromosome for tissue-specific genes in Drosophila. Therefore, MSCI and other selection-based models such as sexual antagonism, dosage compensation, and meiotic-drive continue to be viable models as driving forces shaping the genomic distribution of male-related genes in Drosophila.",2012,"Maria D Vibranovski, Yong E Zhang, Claus Kemkemer, Hedibert F Lopes, Timothy L Karr, Manyuan Long, Maria D Vibranovski, Yong E Zhang, Claus Kemkemer, Hedibert F Lopes, Timothy L Karr, Manyuan Long"
Roles of histone acetylation modification in basal and inducible expression of hsp26 gene in D. melanogaster,17619947,10.1007/s11010-007-9547-x,"The promoter of the Drosophila hsp26 gene contains two DNase I-hypersensitive (DH) sites and a positioned nucleosome, and this open chromatin structure is required for heat-inducible expression. Histone acetylation modification participates in transcriptional regulation of genes by affecting the status of chromatin remodeling. In this study, we investigated the roles of histone acetylation modification on hsp26 expression in Drosophila. We showed that the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI) treatments of Drosophila larvae induced the histone H3 hyperacetylation at the promoter DH sites, which facilitated the binding of heat shock factor (HSF) to heat shock element (HSE). This resulted in a promoted transcription of hsp26 gene following the heat shock, and further increased the inducible expression of hsp26 gene. On the contrary, the HDI-induced histone H3 hyperacetylation in the middle nucleosome decreased the basal expression of hsp26 gene under the normal growth conditions. In addition, by following up the heat-shock time course, we showed that the histone acetylation level at the DH sites exhibited a drop-raise-drop change, while that at the positioned nucleosome underwent a raise-drop-raise-drop switchover. These results demonstrated the distinct roles played by histone acetylation modification in hsp26 gene basal and inducible expression regulation in D. melanogaster.",2007,"Yanmei Zhao, Jun Lu, Hui Sun, Xia Chen, Baiqu Huang, Yanmei Zhao, Jun Lu, Hui Sun, Xia Chen, Baiqu Huang"
Molecular structure of a gypsy element of Drosophila subobscura (gypsyDs) constituting a degenerate form of insect retroviruses,8600460,10.1093/nar/24.5.914,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of a 7.5 kb full-size gypsy element from Drosophila subobscura strain H-271. Comparative analyses were carried out on the sequence and molecular structure of gypsy elements of D.subobscura (gypsyDs), D.melanogaster (gypsyDm) and D.virilis (gypsyDv). The three elements show a structure that maintains a common mechanism of expression. ORF1 and ORF2 show typical motifs of gag and pol genes respectively in the three gypsy elements and could encode functional proteins necessary for intracellular expansion. In the three ORF1 proteins an arginine-rich region was found which could constitute a RNA binding motif. The main differences among the gypsy elements are found in ORF3 (env-like gene); gypsyDm encodes functional env proteins, whereas gypsyDs and gypsyDv ORF3s lack some motifs essential for functionality of this protein. On the basis of these results, while gypsyDm is the first insect retrovirus described, gypsyDs and gypsyDv could constitute degenerate forms of these retroviruses. In this context, we have found some evidence that gypsyDm could have recently infected some D.subobscura strains. Comparative analyses of divergence and phylogenetic relationships of gypsy elements indicate that the gypsy elements belonging to species of different subgenera (gypsyDs and gypsyDv) are closer than gypsy elements of species belonging to the same subgenus (gypsyDs and gypsyDm). These data are congruent with horizontal transfer of gypsy elements among different Drosophila spp.",1996,"T M Alberola, R de Frutos, T M Alberola, R de Frutos"
Proteomics reveals novel Drosophila seminal fluid proteins transferred at mating,18666829,10.1371/journal.pbio.0060178,"Across diverse taxa, seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) transferred at mating affect the reproductive success of both sexes. Such reproductive proteins often evolve under positive selection between species; because of this rapid divergence, Sfps are hypothesized to play a role in speciation by contributing to reproductive isolation between populations. In Drosophila, individual Sfps have been characterized and are known to alter male sperm competitive ability and female post-mating behavior, but a proteomic-scale view of the transferred Sfps has been missing. Here we describe a novel proteomic method that uses whole-organism isotopic labeling to detect transferred Sfps in mated female D. melanogaster. We identified 63 proteins, which were previously unknown to function in reproduction, and confirmed the transfer of dozens of predicted Sfps. Relative quantification of protein abundance revealed that several of these novel Sfps are abundant in seminal fluid. Positive selection and tandem gene duplication are the prevailing forces of Sfp evolution, and comparative proteomics with additional species revealed lineage-specific changes in seminal fluid content. We also report a proteomic-based gene discovery method that uncovered 19 previously unannotated genes in D. melanogaster. Our results demonstrate an experimental method to identify transferred proteins in any system that is amenable to isotopic labeling, and they underscore the power of combining proteomic and evolutionary analyses to shed light on the complex process of Drosophila reproduction.",2008,"Geoffrey D Findlay, Xianhua Yi, Michael J Maccoss, Willie J Swanson, Geoffrey D Findlay, Xianhua Yi, Michael J Maccoss, Willie J Swanson"
Species-specific effects of single sensillum ablation on mating position in Drosophila,12878676,10.1242/jeb.00522,"Dipteran insects show a wide range of species-specific mating positions. Interspecific transitions from one position to another may reflect sexual or natural selection, or be pleiotropic consequences of other genetic changes. Like many cyclorrhaphan flies, Drosophila species mate with the male on the back of the female, positioned centrally. Mechanosensory sensilla on the male genitalia of three species of the melanogaster species sub-group of Drosophila have species-specific effects on mating position and on courtship success: ablation of a single pair of bristles on the genital claspers of D. melanogaster males halved homotypic mating success, and unilateral ablation produced a contralateral asymmetry in the male's mating posture. Ablation of mechanoreceptors on the male genital lateral plate affected mating posture less radically and had no effect on mating frequency. Surprisingly, ablation of sensilla on the claspers of D. simulans and D. sechellia males showed no effect on homotypic mating. A similar result was found for D. melanogaster x D. simulans hybrid males. The existence of major differences in the sensory bases of mating position and copulation success in closely related species shows how differing mating positions may have evolved and underlines the need for detailed functional studies in studying the evolution of insect genitalia: homologous structures may serve different functions in different species.",2003,"Angel Acebes, Matthew Cobb, Jean-François Ferveur, Angel Acebes, Matthew Cobb, Jean-François Ferveur"
Chromosomal homology and molecular organization of Muller's elements D and E in the Drosophila repleta species group,9071584,,"Thirty-three DNA clones containing protein-coding genes have been used for in situ hybridization to the polytene chromosomes of two Drosophila repleta group species, D. repleta and D. buzzatii. Twenty-six clones gave positive results allowing the precise localization of 26 genes and the tentative identification of another nine. The results were fully consistent with the currently accepted chromosomal homologies and in no case was evidence for reciprocal translocations or pericentric inversions found. Most of the genes mapped to chromosomes 2 and 4 that are homologous, respectively, to chromosome arms 3R and 3L of D. melanogaster (Muller's elements E and D). The comparison of the molecular organization of-these two elements between D. melanogaster and D. repleta (two species that belong to different subgenera and diverged some 62 million years ago) showed an extensive reorganization via paracentric inversions. Using a maximum likelihood procedure, we estimated that 130 paracentric inversions have become fixed in element E after the divergence of the two lineages. Therefore, the evolution rate for element E is approximately one inversion per million years. This value is comparable to previous estimates of the rate of evolution of chromosome X and yields an estimate of 4.5 inversions per million years for the whole Drosophila genome.",1997,"J M Ranz, C Segarra, A Ruiz, J M Ranz, C Segarra, A Ruiz"

Characterization of the effect of Cr(VI) on humoral innate immunity using Drosophila melanogaster,24771359,10.1002/tox.21999,"With the advancement of human race, different anthropogenic activities have heaped the environment with chemicals that can cause alteration in the immune system of exposed organism. As a first line of barrier, the evolutionary conserved innate immunity is crucial for the health of an organism. However, there is paucity of information regarding in vivo assessment of the effect of environmental chemicals on innate immunity. Therefore, we examined the effect of a widely used environmental chemical, Cr(VI), on humoral innate immune response using Drosophila melanogaster. The adverse effect of Cr(VI) on host humoral response was characterized by decreased gene expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the exposed organism. Concurrently, a significantly decreased transcription of humoral pathway receptors (Toll and PGRP) and triglyceride level along with inhibition of antioxidant enzyme activities were observed in exposed organism. This in turn weakened the immune response of exposed organism that was manifested by their reduced resistance against bacterial infection. In addition, overexpression of the components of humoral immunity particularly Diptericin benefits Drosophila from Cr(VI)-induced humoral immune-suppressive effect. To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding negative impact of an environmental chemical on humoral innate immune response of Drosophila along with subsequent protection by AMPs, which may provide novel insight into host-chemical interactions. Also, our data validate the utility and sensitivity of Drosophila as a model that could be used for screening the possible risk of environmental chemicals on innate immunity with minimum ethical concern that can be further extrapolated to higher organisms.",2015,"P Pragya, A K Shukla, R C Murthy, M Z Abdin, D Kar Chowdhuri, P Pragya, A K Shukla, R C Murthy, M Z Abdin, D Kar Chowdhuri"

Affinity binding of non-histone chromatin proteins to the X chromosome of Drosophila by in situ chromatin reconstitution and its significance,3116003,,"Cytophotometric analysis of the in situ binding affinity of non-histone chromosomal protein (NHCP) to the polytenic X chromosome and autosome of Drosophila melanogaster has been carried out using Feulgen-Napthol Yellow S staining technique. The results reveal that the mean transformed absorbance ratio (male:female) with a 547 nm interference band filter for the two specific segments of the X chromosome is close to 0.5, while for a specific segment of an autosome it is close to 1.0, in the two sets of control; namely, the positive control (no treatment) and the negative control (treated with 1 M-urea+2M-NaCl) as well as in the reconstituted chromosomal preparations, which received 1 M-urea+2M-NaCl and the NHCP isolated from D. melanogaster. In contrast, the transformed absorbance ratios (male:female) with a 433 nm interference band filter yielded an interestingly different result. The ratios with a 433 nm filter for the X chromosome segments are significantly greater than 0.5 in all three sets of experiments. This finding by itself suggests that the NHCP binding affinity is dissimilar for the X chromosomes of male and female. When the 433 to 547 nm absorbance ratios were compared among the three sets, the data clearly revealed that in both positive control and NHCP reconstituted samples, the absorbance ratios (i.e. 433:547 nm) are significantly different between X chromosomes from males and those from females, while they are different between autosomes from males and females. The ratios are also not significantly different between male and female, either for the X chromosome or for the autosome in the negative control. These findings, therefore, suggest that there is a stronger binding affinity of NHCP for the male X chromosome of Drosophila, and reinstate the view that the X-chromosomal hyperactivity in male Drosophila is the consequence of a regulated organizational change in the DNA template.",1986,"M Ukil, K Chatterjee, A Dey, S Ghosh, A S Mukherjee, M Ukil, K Chatterjee, A Dey, S Ghosh, A S Mukherjee"

The use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to study immune-nanotoxicity,30451554,10.1080/17435390.2018.1546413,"Nanomaterials (NMs) are widely used in consumer and industrial products, as well as in the field of nanomedicine. Despite their wide array of applications, NMs are regarded as foreign entities by the body and thus induce various immune reactions. In mammals, NMs trigger differential recognition by immune cells such as macrophages, causing perturbation of the immune system. Studies on the pattern recognition of NMs have revealed that the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway plays an essential role in NM-induced innate immunity. However, effects caused by physicochemical properties of NMs on immune response and how NMs are recognized by immune cells are not fully understood. Furthermore, the complexity of the mammalian immune system and interspecies variation are still being debated, and the discordant results warrant the need to address these issues. Drosophila melanogaster has gained popularity as a model to study nanotoxicity. Drosophila innate immunity has extensively been studied, providing insights into our understanding of key signaling cascades involved, and importantly it has conserved immune-related genes and mechanogenetic pathways that represents a useful basis for studying its biological response at molecular level to environmental contaminants such as NMs. Moreover, various genetic tools and reagents enable to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the internalization of NMs by immune cells. Furthermore, numerous forward and reverse genetic approaches can be employed to dissect complex biological processes, such as identifying signal transduction pathways and their core components involved in NM-induced immune responses. This review presents an overview of Drosophila innate immunity, as well as summarizes the impact of NM exposure on immune response in Drosophila.

Novel Wolbachia-transinfected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes possess diverse fitness and vector competence phenotypes,29216317,10.1371/journal.ppat.1006751,"Wolbachia pipientis from Drosophila melanogaster (wMel) is an endosymbiotic bacterium that restricts transmission of human pathogenic flaviviruses and alphaviruses, including dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses, when introduced into the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti.

Despite the success in establishing wMel-infected mosquitoes in wild populations, and the well-characterized antiviral capabilities of wMel, transinfecting different or additional Wolbachia strains into Ae. aegypti may improve disease impact, and perhaps more importantly, could provide a strategy to account for the possible evolution of resistant arboviruses. Here, we report the successful transinfection of Ae. aegypti with the Wolbachia strains wMelCS (D. melanogaster), wRi (D. simulans) and wPip (Culex quinquefasciatus) and assess the effects on Ae. aegypti fitness, cytoplasmic incompatibility, tissue tropism and pathogen blocking in a laboratory setting. The results demonstrate that wMelCS provides a similar degree of protection against dengue virus as wMel following an infectious blood meal, and significantly reduces viral RNA levels beyond that of wMel following a direct challenge with infectious virus in mosquitoes, with no additional fitness cost to the host. The protection provided by wRi is markedly weaker than that of wMelCS, consistent with previous characterisations of these lines in Drosophila, while wPip was found to substantially reduce the fitness of Ae. aegypti.

Developmental plasticity and stability in the tracheal networks supplying Drosophila flight muscle in response to rearing oxygen level,28927826,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.09.006,"While it is clear that the insect tracheal system can respond in a compensatory manner to both hypoxia and hyperoxia, there is substantial variation in how different parts of the system respond. However, the response of tracheal structures, from the tracheoles to the largest tracheal trunks, have not been studied within one species. In this study, we examined the effect of larval/pupal rearing in hypoxia, normoxia, and hyperoxia (10, 21 or 40kPa oxygen) on body size and the tracheal supply to the flight muscles of Drosophila melanogaster, using synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (SR-µCT) to assess flight muscle volumes and the major tracheal trunks, and confocal microscopy to assess the tracheoles. Hypoxic rearing decreased thorax length whereas hyperoxic-rearing decreased flight muscle volumes, suggestive of negative effects of both extremes. Tomography at the broad organismal scale revealed no evidence for enlargement of the major tracheae in response to lower rearing oxygen levels, although tracheal size scaled with muscle volume. However, using confocal imaging, we found a strong inverse relationship between tracheole density within the flight muscles and rearing oxygen level, and shorter tracheolar branch lengths in hypoxic-reared animals. Although prior studies of larger tracheae in other insects indicate that axial diffusing capacity should be constant with sequential generations of branching, this pattern was not found in the fine tracheolar networks, perhaps due to the increasing importance of radial diffusion in this regime.

"Characterization of mature mitochondrial transcripts in Drosophila, and the implications for the tRNA punctuation model in arthropods",19540318,10.1016/j.gene.2009.06.006,"The mitochondrial genome of Drosophila melanogaster is thought to be transcribed in about five polycistronic primary transcripts, which are processed into 11 mRNA, 22 tRNA and two rRNA species required for the genome's function. The tRNA punctuation model has been proposed to predict the cleavage sites used in this process. In this model, tRNAs are removed from the primary transcripts and the fragments that remain become mRNA and rRNA transcripts. Thus the 5' and 3' ends of the major gene transcripts are defined by the endpoints of the intervening tRNA sequences. We used 5' and 3' RACE, and circularization and RT-PCR methods to determine the sequences of both ends of all major gene transcripts of the D. melanogaster mitochondrial genome. In general, the tRNA punctuation model accurately predicts the 3' ends of most mRNA and rRNA molecules, even where there are non-coding residues present. Non-coding residues at the 5' end are evidently removed during RNA processing. The mRNAs begin precisely at the start codon for each gene. In particular, the 5' end of the cox1 gene is the first in-frame sense codon, UCG, implying that this codon serves as the start. In-frame TAA stop codons immediately preceding both the cox1 and cox2 genes may serve to prevent in-frame translation of these genes prior to the completion of processing, and are removed from the mature transcripts. Where multiple tRNA genes are present, as between nad3 and nad5, they are removed sequentially in a 3' to 5' direction.",2009,"James B Stewart, Andrew T Beckenbach, James B Stewart, Andrew T Beckenbach"

The mutant, however, produces <10% of the normal level of wild-type (WT) porin transcripts and 16.5% of WT level of the PORIN protein. The P-element insertion affects only the expression of Class I transcript but not Class II transcript of the porin gene. Unlike in WT, the mutant displays an ERG (electroretinogram) that is not maintained during a prolonged light stimulus.

Molecular and comparative genetics of mental retardation,15020472,10.1534/genetics.166.2.835,"Affecting 1-3% of the population, mental retardation (MR) poses significant challenges for clinicians and scientists.

We estimate that hundreds more MR genes remain to be identified. A novel test, in which we distributed unmapped MR disorders proportionately across the autosomes, failed to eliminate the well-known X-chromosome overrepresentation of MR genes and candidate genes. This evidence argues against ascertainment bias as the main cause of the skewed distribution. On the basis of a synthesis of clinical and laboratory data, we developed a biological functions classification scheme for MR genes. Metabolic pathways, signaling pathways, and transcription are the most common functions, but numerous other aspects of neuronal and glial biology are controlled by MR genes as well. Using protein sequence and domain-organization comparisons, we found a striking conservation of MR genes and genetic pathways across the approximately 700 million years that separate Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster. Eighty-seven percent have one or more fruit fly homologs and 76% have at least one candidate functional ortholog. We propose that D. melanogaster can be used in a systematic manner to study MR and possibly to develop bioassays for therapeutic drug discovery. We selected 42 Drosophila orthologs as most likely to reveal molecular and cellular mechanisms of nervous system development or plasticity relevant to MR.",2004,"Jennifer K Inlow, Linda L Restifo, Jennifer K Inlow, Linda L Restifo"
Dictyostelium nucleoside diphosphate kinase highly homologous to Nm23 and Awd proteins involved in mammalian tumor metastasis and Drosophila development,2163458,10.1093/jnci/82.14.1199,"Two complementary DNAs (cDNAs) previously isolated, one by functional screening and the other by immunological screening of a Dictyostelium discoideum expression library, encode two proteins, Gip17 and Guk7.2, sharing 71% homology. In the present study, we found that the expression of their messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is developmentally regulated, with a sharp decrease during the first hours of differentiation. The Gip17 protein was purified to homogeneity from D. discoideum amoebas and from recombinant Escherichia coli and was conclusively identified as a nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase. NDP kinases play a major role in synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates and, in many systems, are found associated with guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins. We found the Gip17 protein to be 77% homologous to the human Nm23 protein and 75% homologous to the Drosophila melanogaster Awd protein. The levels of murine and human nm23 mRNA and Nm23 protein are significantly reduced in tumor cells of high metastatic potential, suggesting that Nm23 is involved in suppression of mammalian tumor metastasis, and mutants of the awd gene exhibit widespread development abnormalities, suggesting that Awd is involved in D. melanogaster development. The high percentage of homology of the Gip17 and Guk7.2 proteins with the Nm23 and Awd proteins indicates that Nm23 and Awd also have nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity. Possible modulations in the activity of this metabolic enzyme could be related to the altered metabolism of tumor cells and the control of metastatic potential. Our results point to an unexpected role of NDP kinase in development, growth control, and oncogenic transformation.",1990,"V Wallet, R Mutzel, H Troll, O Barzu, B Wurster, M Veron, M L Lacombe, V Wallet, R Mutzel, H Troll, O Barzu, B Wurster, M Veron, M L Lacombe"
A two-step method for permeabilization of Drosophila eggs,2507226,10.1016/0011-2240(89)90069-2,"As a first step in developing a procedure for the cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster embryos, we have established a method for permeabilization of the eggcase and have initiated studies of the hydraulic conductivity of permeabilized embryos and the permeation of selected cryoprotective agents. The eggcase of D. melanogaster embryos has a wax layer that precludes any flux of water. A two-step procedure employing organic solvents was developed to effect removal of the wax layer with minimal deleterious effects on the embryos. Dechorionated embryos (Oregon-R strain P2, 12 to 13 hr old) were rinsed sequentially in isopropanol and hexane. After removal of solvent, embryos were held in a modified cell culture medium for further manipulation. This procedure routinely yielded 80 to 95% of the eggs permeabilized (as determined by osmotic contraction in 1 M sucrose) and 75 to 90% survival (incidence of hatching). Hydraulic conductivity of permeabilized embryos and permeation of cryoprotectants were determined using a microdiffusion chamber and computerized video microscopy. Regression analysis of the volumetric data from individual embryos yielded the Boyle-van't Hoff function FVeq = 0.124 (osm-1) + 0.541 with the standard deviations of slope and intercept (Vb) being 0.010 and 0.040, respectively. Permeabilized embryos exhibited ideal osmotic behavior over the range of 0.265 to 2.00 osm. The mean hydraulic conductivity coefficient (Lp) was 0.722 +/- 0.366 micron/(min.atm) at 20 degrees C, based on observations of contraction following a step change in concentration of Ringer's solution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1989,"D V Lynch, T T Lin, S P Myers, S P Leibo, R J Macintyre, R E Pitt, P L Steponkus, D V Lynch, T T Lin, S P Myers, S P Leibo, R J Macintyre, R E Pitt, P L Steponkus"
The conserved mitochondrial genomes of Drosophila mercatorum (Diptera: Drosophilidae) with different reproductive modes and phylogenetic implications,31362022,10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.07.184,"Fruit flies (Drosophilidae: Drosophila) are commonly found in daily life and have long been used as model organisms in biology researches. Drosophila mercatorum is one important member of the Drosophila genus and has been used to study centrosome assembly of cells. In this study, we sequenced and analyzed the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of D. mercatorum, finding that it contains the typical structure of 37 genes and a control region. The arrangement of mitochondrial genes is in accordance with that in other Drosophila species, which is considered the ancestral organization of insects' mitogenomes. Phylogenetic analyses were performed based on 23 species of Drosophila. Our results supported two monophyletic subgenera, Drosophila and Sophophora, except for D. willistoni which was presented as an early offshoot of Drosophila. The topology ((D. yakuba + D. erecta) + D. melanogaster) was supported. We further compared the mitogenomes of parthenogenesis and sexual reproduction strains of D. mercatorum. However, only one synonymous mutation in COI gene was identified, indicating mitogenomic evolution is not strongly correlated with the different reproductive modes of this species. Taken together, our results demonstrate that mitogenome is an effective molecular marker that can be further used in phylogenetic studies of Drosophila and other organisms.",2019,"Antong Wang, Zhenyong Du, Xi Luo, Fengchao Zhang, Junzheng Zhang, Hu Li, Antong Wang, Zhenyong Du, Xi Luo, Fengchao Zhang, Junzheng Zhang, Hu Li"
Functional traits of the gut microbiome correlated with host lipid content in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster,32097599,10.1098/rsbl.2019.0803,"Most research on the nutritional significance of the gut microbiome is conducted on laboratory animals, and its relevance to wild animals is largely unknown. This study investigated the microbiome correlates of lipid content in individual wild fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster. Lipid content varied 3.6-fold among the flies and was significantly correlated with the abundance of gut-derived bacterial DNA sequences that were assigned to genes contributing to 16 KEGG pathways. These included genes encoding sugar transporters and enzymes in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, potentially promoting sugar consumption by the gut microbiome and, thereby, a lean fly phenotype. Furthermore, the lipid content of wild flies was significantly lower than laboratory flies, indicating that, as for some mammalian models, certain laboratory protocols might be obesogenic for Drosophila. This study demonstrates the value of research on natural populations to identify candidate microbial genes that influence ecologically important host traits.",2020,"David Kang, Angela E Douglas, David Kang, Angela E Douglas"

Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model to resolve the unanswered questions about the blood cell development. This study describes the role of Beadex, a Drosophila homologue of LIM domain only 2 (LMO2), in haematopoiesis. Mutants of Beadex were analysed for blood cell abnormalities. Crystal cells, a subset of haemocytes, were significantly more in Beadex hypermorphic flies. Similarly, Beadex misexpression in prohemocytes altered the crystal cell numbers. Stage-specific misexpression analyses demonstrated that Beadex functions after the prohemocytes enter the crystal cell lineage. We also discovered that Pannier-U-shaped complex is a negative regulator of the crystal cell differentiation and is possibly negatively regulated by Beadex through its interaction with Pannier. We, therefore, suggest the mechanism of two novel regulators of crystal cell specification-Beadex and Pannier-during Drosophila haematopoiesis.",2019,"Arunita Chatterjee, Kumar Aavula, Upendra Nongthomba, Arunita Chatterjee, Kumar Aavula, Upendra Nongthomba"

Here, we have assessed the role of Edin (elevated during infection) in the immune response against the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi in Drosophila melanogaster larvae. The expression of edin was induced within hours after a wasp infection in larval fat bodies. Using tissue-specific RNAi, we show that Edin is an important determinant of the encapsulation response. Although edin expression in the fat body was required for the larvae to mount a normal encapsulation response, it was dispensable in hemocytes. Edin expression in the fat body was not required for lamellocyte differentiation, but it was needed for the increase in plasmatocyte numbers and for the release of sessile hemocytes into the hemolymph. We conclude that edin expression in the fat body affects the outcome of a wasp infection by regulating the increase of plasmatocyte numbers and the mobilization of sessile hemocytes in Drosophila larvae.",2015,"Leena-Maija Vanha-Aho, Ines Anderl, Laura Vesala, Dan Hultmark, Susanna Valanne, Mika Rämet, Leena-Maija Vanha-Aho, Ines Anderl, Laura Vesala, Dan Hultmark, Susanna Valanne, Mika Rämet"
Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for Alzheimer's disease,24267573,10.1186/1750-1326-8-35,"Drosophila melanogaster provides an important resource for in vivo modifier screens of neurodegenerative diseases. To study the underlying pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, fly models that address Tau or amyloid toxicity have been developed. Overexpression of human wild-type or mutant Tau causes age-dependent neurodegeneration, axonal transport defects and early death. Large-scale screens utilizing a neurodegenerative phenotype induced by eye-specific overexpression of human Tau have identified several kinases and phosphatases, apoptotic regulators and cytoskeleton proteins as determinants of Tau toxicity in vivo. The APP ortholog of Drosophila (dAPPl) shares the characteristic domains with vertebrate APP family members, but does not contain the human Aβ42 domain. To circumvent this drawback, researches have developed strategies by either direct secretion of human Aβ42 or triple transgenic flies expressing human APP, β-secretase and Drosophila γ-secretase presenilin (dPsn).

However, by combining these data with results from a well-powered Evolve and Resequence (E&R) study on the same trait, we provide statistical evidence that some power to associate genotype and phenotype is available. Genes that are significant in both analyses are enriched for expression in the nervous system, and affect neural development and synaptic growth when perturbed. Quantitative complementation at one of these loci, Syntrophin-like 1, supports a hypothesis that variation at this locus affects variation in the inter-pulse interval of courtship song.

First, we survey genetic variability in the strength of D. simulans-mediated maternal effect hybrid lethality among 37 geographic and laboratory isolates. We find abundant variability in the strength of maternal effect hybrid lethality, ranging from complete lethality to none. Second, we assess maternal effect hybrid lethality for a subset of wild isolates made heterozygous with two so-called hybrid rescue strains.

Odor and pheromone detection in Drosophila melanogaster,17205355,10.1007/s00424-006-0190-2,"Drosophila melanogaster has proven to be a useful model system to probe the mechanisms underlying the detection, discrimination, and perception of volatile odorants. The relatively small receptor repertoire of 62 odorant receptors makes the goal of understanding odor responses from the total receptor repertoire approachable in this system, and recent work has been directed toward this goal. In addition, new work not only sheds light but also raises more questions about the initial steps in odor perception in this system. Odorant receptor genes in Drosophila are predicted to encode seven transmembrane receptors, but surprising data suggest that these receptors may be inverted in the plasma membrane compared to classical G-protein coupled receptors. Finally, although some Drosophila odorant receptors are activated directly by odorant molecules, detection of a volatile pheromone, 11-cis vaccenyl acetate requires an extracellular adapter protein called LUSH for activation of pheromone sensitive neurons. Because pheromones are used by insects to trigger mating and other behaviors, these insights may herald new approaches to control behavior in pathogenic and agricultural pest insects.",2007,"Dean P Smith, Dean P Smith"

Dominant modifier tests can then be employed to identify genetic enhancers and suppressors. To analyze a gene's role in the pEMT, one can then visualize peripodial cells in vivo at the time of eversion within the pupal case using live markers, and by dissecting, fixing, and immunostaining the prepupae. Alternatively, one can analyze the pEMT ex vivo by dissecting out wing discs and culturing them in the presence of ecdysone to induce eversion.

Comparative genomic analysis of novel conserved peptide upstream open reading frames in Drosophila melanogaster and other dipteran species,18237443,10.1186/1471-2164-9-61,"Background:
      
    

    
      Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are elements found in the 5'-region of an mRNA transcript, capable of regulating protein production of the largest, or major ORF (mORF), and impacting organismal development and growth in fungi, plants, and animals. In Drosophila, approximately 40% of transcripts contain upstream start codons (uAUGs) but there is little evidence that these are translated and affect their associated mORF.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Analyzing 19,389 Drosophila melanogaster transcript annotations and 666,153 dipteran EST sequences we have identified 44 putative conserved peptide uORFs (CPuORFs) in Drosophila melanogaster that show evidence of negative selection, and therefore are likely to be translated. Transcripts with CPuORFs constitute approximately 0.3% of the total number of transcripts, a similar frequency to the Arabidopsis genome, and have a mean length of 70 amino acids, much larger than the mean length of plant CPuORFs (40 amino acids). There is a statistically significant clustering of CPuORFs at cytological band 57 (p = 10-5), a phenomenon that has never been described for uORFs. Based on GO term and Interpro domain analyses, genes in the uORF dataset show a higher frequency of ORFs implicated in mitochondrial import than the genome-wide frequency (p < 0.01) as well as methyltransferases (p < 0.02).
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Based on these data, it is clear that Drosophila contain putative CPuORFs at frequencies similar to those found in plants. They are distinguished, however, by the type of mORF they tend to associate with, Drosophila CPuORFs preferentially occurring in transcripts encoding mitochondrial proteins and methyltransferases. This provides a basis for the study of CPuORFs and their putative regulatory role in mitochondrial function and disease.",2008,"Celine A Hayden, Giovanni Bosco, Celine A Hayden, Giovanni Bosco"

Interestingly, the result shows that acute LC50 of cryolite was much greater in comparison to the chronic one in case of Drosophila larvae. Larvae which were exposed to 65,000 to 70,000 µg/ml cryolite through food showed 50% mortality after 18 hours of acute exposure, whereas only 150 to 160 µg/ml cryolite was sufficient to cause 50% mortality in case of chronic exposure. Thus cryolite in a small amount when applied once cannot produce noticeable changes in Drosophila, whereas the same amount when used continuously can be fatal. The non-feeding pupal stage was also seen to be affected by chemical treatment. This suggests that the test chemical affects the developmental fate and results in failure of adult emergence. Absence of chemical-induced mortality in adults assumes that the toxicity of cryolite might be restricted to the preimaginal stages of the organism. Reduction in body size of larvae after ingestion of cryolite (with food) in acute treatment schedule is another interesting finding of this study. Some individuals consuming cryolite containing food cannot survive whereas the few survivors manifest a significant growth retardation which might be due to a tendency of refusal in feeding. Hence the present findings provide a scope of assessment of risk of other similar non-target groups.",2014,"Sayanti Podder, Sumedha Roy, Sayanti Podder, Sumedha Roy"
Gene regulation in Drosophila spermatogenesis: analysis of protein binding at the translational control element TCE,8111973,10.1002/dvg.1020140606,"We have previously identified a 12 nucleotide long sequence element, the TCE, that was demonstrated to be necessary for translational control of expression in the male germ line of Drosophila melanogaster (Schäfer et al., 1990). It is conserved among all seven members of the Mst(3)CGP gene family, that encode structural proteins of the sperm tail. The TCE is invariably located in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) at position +28 relative to the transcription start site. In this paper we analyse the mode of action of this element. We show that protein binding occurs at the TCE after incubation with testis protein extracts from Drosophila melanogaster. While several proteins are associated with the translational control element in the RNA, only one of these proteins directly crosslinks to the sequence element. The binding activity is exclusively observed with testis protein extracts but can be demonstrated with testis extracts from other Drosophila species as well, indicating that regulatory proteins involved in translational regulation in the male germ line are conserved. Although binding to the TCE can occur independent of its position relative to the transcription start site of the in vitro transcripts, its function in vivo is not exerted when shifted further downstream within the 5' UTR of a fusion gene. In addition to being a translational control element the TCE also functions as a transcriptional regulator. Consequently, a DNA-protein complex is also formed at the TCE. In contrast to the RNA-protein complexes we find DNA-protein complexes with protein extracts of several tissues of Drosophila melanogaster.",1993,"E Kempe, B Muhs, M Schäfer, E Kempe, B Muhs, M Schäfer"
Unconstrained evolution in short introns? - an analysis of genome-wide polymorphism and divergence data from Drosophila,22901008,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02580.x,"An unconstrained reference sequence facilitates the detection of selection. In Drosophila, sequence variation in short introns seems to be least influenced by selection and dominated by mutation and drift. Here, we test this with genome-wide sequences using an African population (Malawi) of D. melanogaster and data from the related outgroup species D. simulans, D. sechellia, D. erecta and D. yakuba. The distribution of mutations deviates from equilibrium, and the content of A and T (AT) nucleotides shows an excess of variance among introns. We explain this by a complex mutational pattern: a shift in mutational bias towards AT, leading to a slight nonequilibrium in base composition and context-dependent mutation rates, with G or C (GC) sites mutating most frequently in AT-rich introns. By comparing the corresponding allele frequency spectra of AT-rich vs. GC-rich introns, we can rule out the influence of directional selection or biased gene conversion on the mutational pattern. Compared with neutral equilibrium expectations, polymorphism spectra show an excess of low frequency and a paucity of intermediate frequency variants, irrespective of the direction of mutation. Combining the information from different outgroups with the polymorphism data and using a generalized linear model, we find evidence for shared ancestral polymorphism between D. melanogaster and D. simulans, D. sechellia, arguing against a bottleneck in D. melanogaster. Generally, we find that short introns can be used as a neutral reference on a genome-wide level, if the spatially and temporally varying mutational pattern is accounted for.",2012,"F Clemente, C Vogl, F Clemente, C Vogl"
A combined molecular and cytogenetic approach to genome evolution in Drosophila using large-fragment DNA cloning,8486077,10.1007/BF00352399,"Methods of genome analysis, including the cloning and manipulation of large fragments of DNA, have opened new strategies for uniting molecular evolutionary genetics with chromosome evolution. We have begun the development of a physical map of the genome of Drosophila virilis based on large DNA fragments cloned in bacteriophage P1. A library of 10,080 P1 clones with average insert sizes of 65.8 kb, containing approximately 3.7 copies of the haploid genome of D. virilis, has been constructed and characterized. Approximately 75% of the clones have inserts exceeding 50 kb, and approximately 25% have inserts exceeding 80 kb. A sample of 186 randomly selected clones was mapped by in situ hybridization with the salivary gland chromosomes. A method for identifying D. virilis clones containing homologs of D. melanogaster genes has also been developed using hybridization with specific probes obtained from D. melanogaster by means of the polymerase chain reaction. This method proved successful for nine of ten genes and resulted in the recovery of 14 clones. The hybridization patterns of a sample of P1 clones containing repetitive DNA were also determined. A significant fraction of these clones hybridizes to multiple euchromatic sites but not to the chromocenter, which is a pattern of hybridization that is very rare among clones derived from D. melanogaster. The materials and methods described will make it possible to carry out a direct study of molecular evolution at the level of chromosome structure and organization as well as at the level of individual genes.",1993,"E R Lozovskaya, D A Petrov, D L Hartl, E R Lozovskaya, D A Petrov, D L Hartl"
"Complexity of the genetic basis of ageing in nature revealed by a clinal study of lifespan and methuselah, a gene for ageing, in Drosophila from eastern Australia",23802551,10.1111/mec.12353,"Clinal studies are a powerful tool for understanding the genetic basis of climatic adaptation. However, while clines in quantitative traits and genetic polymorphisms have been observed within and across continents, few studies have attempted to demonstrate direct links between them. The gene methuselah in Drosophila has been shown to have a major effect on stress response and longevity phenotypes based largely on laboratory studies of induced mutations in the mth gene. Clinal patterns in the most common mth haplotype and for lifespan (both increasing with latitude) have been observed in North American populations of D. melanogaster, implicating climatic selection. While these clinal patterns have led some to suggest that mth influences ageing in natural populations, limited evidence on the association between the two has so far been collected. Here, we describe a significant cline in the mth haplotype in eastern Australian D. melanogaster populations that parallel the cline in North America. We also describe a cline in mth gene expression. These findings further support the idea that mth is itself under selection. In contrast, we show that lifespan has a strong nonlinear clinal pattern, increasing southwards from the tropics, but then decreasing again from mid-latitudes. Furthermore, in association studies, we find no evidence for a direct link between mth haplotype and lifespan. Thus, while our data support a role for mth variation being under natural selection, we found no link to naturally occurring variation in lifespan and ageing in Australian populations of D. melanogaster. Our results indicate that the mth locus likely has genetic background and environment-specific effects.",2013,"Carla M Sgrò, Belinda van Heerwaarden, Vanessa Kellermann, Choon W Wee, Ary A Hoffmann, Siu F Lee, Carla M Sgrò, Belinda van Heerwaarden, Vanessa Kellermann, Choon W Wee, Ary A Hoffmann, Siu F Lee"

Analysis of Drosophila melanogaster testis transcriptome,30249207,10.1186/s12864-018-5085-z,"Background:
      
    

    
      The formation of matured and individual sperm involves a series of molecular and spectacular morphological changes of the developing cysts in Drosophila melanogaster testis. Recent advances in RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology help us to understand the complexity of eukaryotic transcriptomes by dissecting different tissues and developmental stages of organisms. To gain a better understanding of cellular differentiation of spermatogenesis, we applied RNA-Seq to analyse the testis-specific transcriptome, including coding and non-coding genes.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We isolated three different parts of the wild-type testis by dissecting and cutting the different regions: 1.) the apical region, which contains stem cells and developing spermatocytes 2.) the middle region, with enrichment of meiotic cysts 3.) the basal region, which contains elongated post-meiotic cysts with spermatids. Total RNA was isolated from each region and analysed by next-generation sequencing. We collected data from the annotated 17412 Drosophila genes and identified 5381 genes with significant transcript accumulation differences between the regions, representing the main stages of spermatogenesis. We demonstrated for the first time the presence and region specific distribution of 2061 lncRNAs in testis, with 203 significant differences. Using the available modENCODE RNA-Seq data, we determined the tissue specificity indices of Drosophila genes. Combining the indices with our results, we identified genes with region-specific enrichment in testis.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      By multiple analyses of our results and integrating existing knowledge about Drosophila melanogaster spermatogenesis to our dataset, we were able to describe transcript composition of different regions of Drosophila testis, including several stage-specific transcripts.

To understand the effects of gene duplication on transcriptional regulation associated with environmental changes, we focused on the starch hydrolysis pathway, in which amylase enzymes together with maltase enzymes hydrolyze starch into glucose. Drosophila genomes involve ten duplicated Maltase genes. We examined the levels of transcription of the nine of these genes in 36 lines of Drosophila melanogaster collected from a natural population. In the investigated population, the levels of transcription were different between the two dietary carbohydrate sources, glucose and starch. At the transcriptional level, a single Maltase gene, which transcribes the specific Maltase transcripts, worked together with an Amylase gene in the pathway. The three of nine genes responded to carbohydrate changes, and the degree of the response was similar to Amylase gene.

In this study, we used Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism and supplemented a culture medium with 1 M sucrose to create a high sugar condition. Our results indicate that a high sugar diet promoted differentiation of intestinal stem cells through upregulation of the JNK pathway and downregulation of the JAK/STAT pathway.

Measuring and Altering Mating Drive in Male Drosophila melanogaster,28287580,10.3791/55291,"Despite decades of investigation, the neuronal and molecular bases of motivational states remain mysterious. We have recently developed a novel, reductionist, and scalable system for in-depth investigation of motivation using the mating drive of male Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila), the methods for which we detail here. The behavioral paradigm centers on the finding that male mating drive decreases alongside fertility over the course of repeated copulations and recovers over ~3 d. In this system, the powerful neurogenetic tools available in the fly converge with the genetic accessibility and putative wiring diagram available for sexual behavior. This convergence allows rapid isolation and interrogation of small neuronal populations with specific motivational functions. Here we detail the design and execution of the satiety assay that is used to measure and alter courtship motivation in the male fly. Using this assay, we also demonstrate that low male mating drive can be overcome by stimulating dopaminergic neurons. The satiety assay is simple, affordable, and robust to influences of genetic background.

Evidence for a radial SNARE super-complex mediating neurotransmitter release at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction,23687382,10.1242/jcs.123802,"The SNARE proteins VAMP/synaptobrevin, SNAP-25 and syntaxin are core components of the apparatus that mediates neurotransmitter release. They form a heterotrimeric complex, and an undetermined number of SNARE complexes assemble to form a super-complex. Here, we present a radial model of this nanomachine. Experiments performed with botulinum neurotoxins led to the identification of one arginine residue in SNAP-25 and one aspartate residue in syntaxin (R206 and D253 in Drosophila melanogaster). These residues are highly conserved and predicted to play a major role in the protein-protein interactions between SNARE complexes by forming an ionic couple. Accordingly, we generated transgenic Drosophila lines expressing SNAREs mutated in these residues and performed an electrophysiological analysis of their neuromuscular junctions.

Effect of ionic concentration on the higher-order structure of prophenol oxidase in Drosophila melanogaster,11521509,10.1023/a:1010233307490,"Phenol oxidase in Drosophila melanogaster occurs as precursors designated prophenol oxidases A1 and A3.

Prophenol oxidases were partially purified using ammonium sulfate fractionation, phenyl Sepharose, and DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. The preparations were mixed, then dialyzed against buffer containing varying salt concentrations. The resulting prophenol oxidase was analyzed by gel electrophoresis. At 20 mM KCl or NaCl, two bands of phenol oxidase were observed, corresponding to the parental ones as monomer, whereas at 200 mM KCl or NaCl, three bands appeared in the gel, one being a dimer. The monomer-dimer reversibility of the Drosophila prophenol oxidase depends on the salt concentrations. The phenol oxidase activity remained unaffected within the KCl concentrations tested. Considering the ionic concentration of Drosophila hemolymph, these results indicate that prophenol oxidase exists as a dimer in vivo, and the higher-order structure of prophenol oxidase can be altered reversibly by ionic concentrations in vitro.",2001,"H Sezaki, N Kawamoto, N Asada, H Sezaki, N Kawamoto, N Asada"
Expression of a cystine-rich fish antifreeze in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster,8589739,10.1007/BF01979921,We have used Drosophila melanogaster as a model system for the transgenic expression of cystine-rich Type II antifreeze protein (AFP) from sea raven.

Drosophila-produced Type II AFP demonstrated antifreeze activity both in terms of thermal hysteresis (0.13 degree C) and inhibition of ice recrystallization. Recombinant AFP was purified and N-terminal sequencing revealed a 17 aa extension that began at the predicted signal peptide cleavage point.

The morphogenesis and growth of axenic Drosophila melanogaster were assessed from embryo to adult stage when provided with each probiotic strain-supplemented food. The colonization and persistence of probiotic in fly gut were also evaluated. The results indicated that axenic condition caused the lowest adult weight and emergence rate.

Sisters unbound is required for meiotic centromeric cohesion in Drosophila melanogaster,25194162,10.1534/genetics.114.166009,"Regular meiotic chromosome segregation requires sister centromeres to mono-orient (orient to the same pole) during the first meiotic division (meiosis I) when homologous chromosomes segregate, and to bi-orient (orient to opposite poles) during the second meiotic division (meiosis II) when sister chromatids segregate. Both orientation patterns require cohesion between sister centromeres, which is established during meiotic DNA replication and persists until anaphase of meiosis II. Meiotic cohesion is mediated by a conserved four-protein complex called cohesin that includes two structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) subunits (SMC1 and SMC3) and two non-SMC subunits. In Drosophila melanogaster, however, the meiotic cohesion apparatus has not been fully characterized and the non-SMC subunits have not been identified. We have identified a novel Drosophila gene called sisters unbound (sunn), which is required for stable sister chromatid cohesion throughout meiosis. sunn mutations disrupt centromere cohesion during prophase I and cause high frequencies of non-disjunction (NDJ) at both meiotic divisions in both sexes. SUNN co-localizes at centromeres with the cohesion proteins SMC1 and SOLO in both sexes and is necessary for the recruitment of both proteins to centromeres. Although SUNN lacks sequence homology to cohesins, bioinformatic analysis indicates that SUNN may be a structural homolog of the non-SMC cohesin subunit stromalin (SA), suggesting that SUNN may serve as a meiosis-specific cohesin subunit. In conclusion, our data show that SUNN is an essential meiosis-specific Drosophila cohesion protein.",2014,"Badri Krishnan, Sharon E Thomas, Rihui Yan, Hirotsugu Yamada, Igor B Zhulin, Bruce D McKee, Badri Krishnan, Sharon E Thomas, Rihui Yan, Hirotsugu Yamada, Igor B Zhulin, Bruce D McKee"
Biotransformation of xenobiotics in Drosophila melanogaster and its relevance for mutagenicity testing,6783378,10.3109/03602538008994025,"Biotransformation of lipophilic xenobiotics may lead to formation of reactive intermediates which can give rise to irreversible toxic events such as carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, teratogenesis, and tissue necrosis. In recent years considerable attention has been paid to the problem of testing for these effects. Short-term mutagenicity tests have been shown to have value for predicting the occurrence of delayed toxic effects in mammals following administration of indirectly acting harmful xenobiotics. In any test system the capacity to bioactivate the compound under test is a necessary prerequisite, and in most short-term test assays this is provided for by adding a metabolic activation system generally consisting of the 9,000 g supernatant fraction of a rat liver homogenate supplied with cofactors. The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster constitutes an organism well-suited for mutagenicity testing, and it was shown that a number of precarcinogens evoke mutagenic effects in this species. Thus Drosophila is apparently able to metabolize xenobiotics to reactive intermediates, which in turn induce mutagenicity. However, knowledge about the presence and characteristics of the xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes involved is lacking. Since knowledge of these enzymes contributes to the evaluation and interpretation of observed mutagenic events, this paper described studies concerning some important xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes of Drosophila. Files were homogenized and subcellular fractions were investigated with respect to enzymatic activities. It was possible to demonstrate cytochrome P-450 and some related mixed-function oxidase activities. Cytochrome b5, epoxide hydrolase, and glutathione S-transferase are also present, while preliminary experiments suggest the presence of UDP-glucosyltransferase and phosphotransferase activities. The enzymes which have been found are discussed with respect to their similarities with rat liver enzymes and their relevance for mutagenicity testing with Drosophila melanogaster.",1980,"A J Baars, A J Baars"
The imbalance of serotonergic circuitry impairing the crop supercontractile muscle activity and the mitochondrial morphology of PD PINK1 B9 Drosophila melanogaster are rescued by Mucuna pruriens,30393142,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2018.10.007,"Despite its great potentiality, little attention has been paid to modelling gastrointestinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) in Drosophila melanogaster (Dm). Our previous studies on standardized Mucuna pruriens extract (Mpe) have shown usefulness in the Drosophila model of PD. In this communication, we provide new information on the effect of Mpe on basal and serotonin treated contractions in the crop (i.e., an important and essential part of the gut) in Drosophila PD mutant for PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1B9) gene. The effect of Mpe on PINK1B9 supplied with standard diet to larvae and/or adults, were assayed on 10-15 days old flies. Conversely from what we observed in the wild type flies, recordings demonstrated that exogenous applications of serotonin on crop muscles of untreated PINK1B9 affect neither the frequency nor the amplitude of the crop contraction, while the same muscle parameters are enhanced following brain injections of serotonin, thus suggesting that PINK1B9 mutants may likely have an impairment in the serotonergic pathways. Also, the mitochondrial morphology in the crop muscles is strongly compromised, as demonstrated by the transmission electron microscopy analysis. The Mpe treatment rescued the crop muscle parameters and also the mitochondrial morphology when supplied to both larvae and adults.

"Integration of JAK/STAT receptor-ligand trafficking, signalling and gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster cells",32917740,10.1242/jcs.246199,"The JAK/STAT pathway is an essential signalling cascade required for multiple processes during development and for adult homeostasis. A key question in understanding this pathway is how it is regulated in different cell contexts. Here we have examined how endocytic processing contributes to signalling by the single cytokine receptor, Domeless, in Drosophila melanogaster cells. We identify an evolutionarily conserved di-Leu motif that is required for Domeless internalisation and show that endocytosis is required for activation of a subset of Domeless targets. Our data indicate that endocytosis both qualitatively and quantitatively regulates Domeless signalling. STAT92E, the single STAT transcription factor in Drosophila, appears to be the target of endocytic regulation and our studies show that phosphorylation of STAT92E on Tyr704, while necessary, is not always sufficient for target transcription. Finally, we identify a conserved residue, Thr702, which is essential for Tyr704 phosphorylation. Taken together, our findings identify previously unknown aspects of JAK/STAT pathway regulation likely to play key roles in the spatial and temporal regulation of signalling in vivo.",2020,"Rachel Moore, Katja Vogt, Adelina E Acosta Martin, Patrick Shire, Martin Zeidler, Elizabeth Smythe, Rachel Moore, Katja Vogt, Adelina E Acosta Martin, Patrick Shire, Martin Zeidler, Elizabeth Smythe"
A Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Model in Drosophila melanogaster,32524489,10.1007/978-1-0716-0585-1_22,"Peripheral neuropathies are one of the largest categories of neurodegenerative diseases. To investigate their mechanisms, many in vitro and in vivo models can be employed. Here we present a protocol for the induction of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in the Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) model system. Using a clinically relevant degeneration initiator, paclitaxel (taxol), it is possible to model many aspects of axon and dendrite degeneration while in a genetically tractable, in vivo system. In this protocol, we feed larval stage Drosophila neurotoxic chemotherapy drugs during the duration of larval development, followed by dissection and imaging of genetically labeled sensory axons and dendrites. Both axons and dendrites degenerate with taxol exposure. Our protocol should facilitate the adoption and expansion of this model to include other neurotoxic compounds.",2020,"Martha R C Bhattacharya, Martha R C Bhattacharya"
Drosophila melanogaster Responses against Entomopathogenic Nematodes: Focus on Hemolymph Clots,31963772,10.3390/insects11010062,"Several insect innate immune mechanisms are activated in response to infection by entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs). In this review, we focus on the coagulation of hemolymph, which acts to stop bleeding after injury and prevent access of pathogens to the body cavity. After providing a general overview of invertebrate coagulation systems, we discuss recent findings in Drosophila melanogaster which demonstrate that clots protect against EPN infections. Detailed analysis at the cellular level provided insight into the kinetics of the secretion of Drosophila coagulation factors, including non-classical modes of secretion. Roughly, clot formation can be divided into a primary phase in which crosslinking of clot components depends on the activity of Drosophila transglutaminase and a secondary, phenoloxidase (PO)-dependent phase, characterized by further hardening and melanization of the clot matrix. These two phases appear to play distinct roles in two commonly used EPN infection models, namely Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and Steinernema carpocapsae. Finally, we discuss the implications of the coevolution between parasites such as EPNs and their hosts for the dynamics of coagulation factor evolution.",2020,"Alexis Dziedziech, Sai Shivankar, Ulrich Theopold, Alexis Dziedziech, Sai Shivankar, Ulrich Theopold"
JAK/STAT signaling is involved in air sac primordium development of Drosophila melanogaster,30854626,10.1002/1873-3468.13355,"The dorsal thoracic air sacs in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) are functionally and developmentally comparable to human lungs. The progenitors of these structures, air sac primordia (ASPs), invasively propagate into wing imaginal disks, employing mechanisms similar to those that promote metastasis in malignant tumors. We investigated whether Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription JAK/STAT signaling plays a role in the directed morphogenesis of ASPs. We find that JAK/STAT signaling occurs in ASP tip cells and misexpression of core components in the JAK/STAT signaling cascade significantly impedes ASP development. We further identify Upd2 as an activating ligand for JAK/STAT activity in the ASP. Together, these data constitute a considerable step forward in understanding the role of JAK/STAT signaling in ASPs and similar structures in mammalian models.",2019,"Nathan Powers, Ajay Srivastava, Nathan Powers, Ajay Srivastava"
Sequence divergence within transposable element families in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,12869581,10.1101/gr.827603,"The availability of the sequenced Drosophila melanogaster genome provides an opportunity to study sequence variation between copies within transposable element families. In this study,we analyzed the 624 copies of 22 transposable element (TE) families (14 LTR retrotransposons, five non-LTR retrotransposons, and three transposons). LTR and non-LTR retrotransposons possessed far fewer divergent elements than the transposons,suggesting that the difference depends on the transposition mechanism. However,there was not a continuous range of divergence of the copies in each class,which were either very similar to the canonical elements,or very divergent from them. This sequence homogeneity among TE family copies matches the theoretical models of the dynamics of these repeated sequences. The sequenced Drosophila genome thus appears to be composed of a mixture of TEs that are still active and of ancient relics that have degenerated and the distribution of which along the chromosomes results from natural selection. This clearly demonstrates that the TEs are highly active within the genome,suggesting that the genetic variability of the Drosophila genome is still being renewed by the action of TEs.",2003,"Emmanuelle Lerat, Carène Rizzon, Christian Biémont, Emmanuelle Lerat, Carène Rizzon, Christian Biémont"
The DFer gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes two membrane-associated proteins that can both transform vertebrate cells,9038371,10.1038/sj.onc.1200875,"The vertebrate gene FER encodes two protein-tyrosine kinases with molecular weights of 51,000 and 94,000 and distinctive aminotermini. The larger kinase is expressed ubiquitously among vertebrate tissues, whereas expression of the smaller kinase appears to be limited to spermatogenic cells in the testes. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster contains an apparent ortholog of FER (DFer) that also produces two mRNAs by separate initiation of transcription, and two proteins with molecular weights of 45,000 and 92,000. Both proteins are in part loosely associated with cytoplasmic membranes. Both can transform avian and rodent cells with roughly equal potency, when expressed from retroviral vectors. Fusing the myristoylation signal from the SRC protein-tyrosine kinase to the aminoterminus of the DFer protein increased the strength of attachment to membranes but augmented transformation only marginally. The results provide the first demonstration of neoplastic transformation by a protein-tyrosine kinase of Drosophila and by FER from any species.

It is therefore desirable to employ suitable model organisms in order to study glomerular disease and elucidate affected pathways. Due to its diverse ways of genetic manipulation and high genomic conservation, Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model organism for biomedical research. The fly was recently used to assess podocytopathies by exploiting the nephrocyte system. Nephrocytes are spherical cells within the body cavity of the fly responsible for detoxification and clearance of unwanted substances. More importantly, they share many characteristics with mammalian podocytes. Here, we summarize how to use Drosophila as a model organism for podocyte research.

Drosophila melanogaster as a Model for Diabetes Type 2 Progression,29854726,10.1155/2018/1417528,"Drosophila melanogaster has been used as a very versatile and potent model in the past few years for studies in metabolism and metabolic disorders, including diabetes types 1 and 2.

Yet, very few studies have addressed the chronic nature of diabetes, key for understanding the full-blown disease, which most studies normally explore. One of the advantages of having Drosophila mutant viable combinations at different levels of the insulin pathway, with significantly reduced insulin pathway signaling, is that the abnormal metabolic state can be studied from the onset of the life cycle and followed throughout. In this review, we look at the chronic nature of impaired insulin signaling.

Here, we present lifespan data of long-lived Drosophila, lacking three of the eight insulin-like peptides [Drosophila insulin-like peptides 2,3,5 (dilp2-3,5)] on nine different diets that surround the optimum for lifespan. Their nutritional content was varied by manipulating sugar and yeast concentrations independently, and thus incorporated changes in both diet restriction and nutrient balance. The mutants were substantially longer-lived than controls on every diet, but the effects on the lifespan response to sugar and yeast differed.

We found that a variety of arrhythmias are part of the heart spectrum in old flies after a lifetime of physical exercise as evidenced by reducing the incidence of fibrillations and increasing the occurrence of bradycardias. Maintenance of myocardial myosin levels may be an underlying contributor to these exercise-induced improvements in cardiac function at an advanced age.

Loss of SPARC dysregulates basal lamina assembly to disrupt larval fat body homeostasis in Drosophila melanogaster,25529377,10.1002/dvdy.24243,"Background:
      
    

    
      SPARC is a collagen-binding glycoprotein whose functions during early development are unknown. We previously reported that SPARC is expressed in Drosophila by hemocytes and the fat body (FB) and enriched in basal laminae (BL) surrounding tissues, including adipocytes. We sought to explore if SPARC is required for proper BL assembly in the FB.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      SPARC deficiency leads to larval lethality, associated with remodeling of the FB. In the absence of SPARC, FB polygonal adipocytes assume a spherical morphology. Loss-of-function clonal analyses revealed a cell-autonomous accumulation of BL components around mutant cells that include collagen IV (Col lV), Laminin, and Perlecan. Ultrastructural analyses indicate SPARC-deficient adipocytes are surrounded by an aberrant accumulation of a fibrous extracellular matrix.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our data indicate a critical requirement for SPARC for the proper BL assembly in Drosophila FB. Since Col IV within the BL is a prime determinant of cell shape, the rounded appearance of SPARC-deficient adipocytes is due to aberrant assembly of Col IV.",2015,"Jaffer Shahab, Cristina Baratta, Bianca Scuric, Dorothea Godt, Koen J T Venken, Maurice J Ringuette, Jaffer Shahab, Cristina Baratta, Bianca Scuric, Dorothea Godt, Koen J T Venken, Maurice J Ringuette"
Balancing crosstalk between 20-hydroxyecdysone-induced autophagy and caspase activity in the fat body during Drosophila larval-prepupal transition,24036278,10.1016/j.ibmb.2013.09.001,"In the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, autophagy and caspase activity function in parallel in the salivary gland during metamorphosis and in a common regulatory hierarchy during oogenesis. Both autophagy and caspase activity progressively increase in the remodeling fat body, and they are induced by a pulse of the molting hormone (20-hydroxyecdysone, 20E) during the larval-prepupal transition. Inhibition of autophagy and/or caspase activity in the remodeling fat body results in 25-40% pupal lethality, depending on the genotypes. Interestingly, a balancing crosstalk occurs between autophagy and caspase activity in this tissue: the inhibition of autophagy induces caspase activity and the inhibition of caspases induces autophagy. The Drosophila remodeling fat body provides an in vivo model for understanding the molecular mechanism of the balancing crosstalk between autophagy and caspase activity, which oppose with each other and are induced by the common stimulus 20E, and blockage of either path reinforces the other path.",2013,"Hanhan Liu, Qiangqiang Jia, Gianluca Tettamanti, Sheng Li, Hanhan Liu, Qiangqiang Jia, Gianluca Tettamanti, Sheng Li"

After establishing a scale of small proboscis movements necessary to characterize responses to olfactory stimulation, we applied Pavlovian conditioning, with five trials consisting of paired presentation of a banana odour and a sucrose reward. Drosophila showed conditioned proboscis activity to the odour, with a twofold increase of percentage of responses after the first trial. No change occurred in flies experiencing unpaired presentations of the stimuli, confirming an associative basis for this form of olfactory learning. The adenylyl cyclase mutant rutabaga did not exhibit learning in this paradigm.

Consequently, it is important to evaluate their potential biological side-effects before crediting their use. To understand the mechanisms of degradation, internalisation, and interaction with different biological targets, we used the in vivo model Drosophila melanogaster to obtain a systematic and complete study on high aspect ratio Ni nanowires (NiNW), compared with low aspect ratio Ni nanospheres (NiNS), and NiSO4 as a model of agent releasing nickel ions. The distinguished shape of nanowires showed changes in their characteristics after oral administration until they reached the intestinal lumen, where their diameter decreased significantly. For the first time, we confirmed the internalization of needle-shaped materials via perforation of the intestinal barrier. Moreover, the results showed that D. melanogaster is a valid and effective tool in studies related to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Additionally, NiNM induced DNA damage and molecular changes at the gene expression level, in association with increase in oxidative stress levels. Notably, the observed negative effects were related to nickel as a metal rather than to its shape, since the effects induced by the three Ni forms were notably similar. In addition, independent of their form, Ni compounds did not induce toxic or mutagenic impacts.

Effect of Larval Nutrition on Maternal mRNA Contribution to the Drosophila Egg,29666195,10.1534/g3.118.200283,"Embryonic development begins under the control of maternal gene products, mRNAs and proteins that the mother deposits into the egg; the zygotic genome is activated some time later. Maternal control of early development is conserved across metazoans. Gene products contributed by mothers are critical to many early developmental processes, and set up trajectories for the rest of development. Maternal deposition of these factors is an often-overlooked aspect of parental investment. If the mother experiences challenging environmental conditions, such as poor nutrition, previous studies in Drosophila melanogaster have demonstrated a plastic response wherein these mothers may produce larger eggs to buffer the offspring against the same difficult environment. This additional investment can produce offspring that are more fit in the challenging environment. With this study, we ask whether D. melanogaster mothers who experience poor nutrition during their own development change their gene product contribution to the egg. We perform mRNA-Seq on eggs at a stage where all mRNAs are maternally derived, from mothers with different degrees of nutritional limitation. We find that nutritional limitation produces similar transcript changes at all degrees of limitation tested. Genes that have lower transcript abundance in nutritionally limited mothers are those involved in translation, which is likely one of the most energetically costly processes occurring in the early embryo. We find an increase in transcripts for transport and localization of macromolecules, and for the electron transport chain. The eggs produced by nutrition-limited mothers show a plastic response in mRNA deposition, which may better prepare the future embryo for development in a nutrition-limited environment.",2018,"Amanda E Crofton, Emily L Cartwright, Anna A Feitzinger, Susan E Lott, Amanda E Crofton, Emily L Cartwright, Anna A Feitzinger, Susan E Lott"

Specifically, we used this apparatus and associated methodology to examine the effects of sex, geographic origin, and developmental rearing temperature on temperature preferences exhibited by adults in a controlled laboratory environment. The thermal gradient established by the apparatus was stable over diurnal and calendar time. Furthermore, the distribution of adult flies across thermal habitats within the apparatus remained stable following the period of acclimation, as evidenced by the high degree of repeatability across both biological and technical replicates. Our data demonstrate significant and predictable variation in temperature preference for all 3 assayed variables. Behaviorally, females were more sensitive than males to higher temperatures. Flies originating from high latitude, temperate populations exhibited a greater preference for cooler temperatures; conversely, flies originating from low latitude, tropical habitats demonstrated a relative preference for higher temperatures. Similarly, larval rearing temperature was positively associated with adult thermal behavior: low culture temperatures increased the relative adult preference for cooler temperatures, and this response was distinct between the sexes and for flies from the temperate and subtropical geographic regions. Together, these results demonstrate that the temperature chamber apparatus elicits robust, predictable, and quantifiable thermal preference behavior that could readily be applied to other taxa to examine the role of temperature-mediated behavior in a variety of contexts.",2016,"Subhash Rajpurohit, Paul S Schmidt, Subhash Rajpurohit, Paul S Schmidt"
Successive increases in the resistance of Drosophila to viral infection through a transposon insertion followed by a Duplication,22028673,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002337,"To understand the molecular basis of how hosts evolve resistance to their parasites, we have investigated the genes that cause variation in the susceptibility of Drosophila melanogaster to viral infection. Using a host-specific pathogen of D. melanogaster called the sigma virus (Rhabdoviridae), we mapped a major-effect polymorphism to a region containing two paralogous genes called CHKov1 and CHKov2. In a panel of inbred fly lines, we found that a transposable element insertion in the protein coding sequence of CHKov1 is associated with increased resistance to infection. Previous research has shown that this insertion results in a truncated messenger RNA that encodes a far shorter protein than the susceptible allele. This resistant allele has rapidly increased in frequency under directional selection and is now the commonest form of the gene in natural populations. Using genetic mapping and site-specific recombination, we identified a third genotype with considerably greater resistance that is currently rare in the wild. In these flies there have been two duplications, resulting in three copies of both the truncated allele of CHKov1 and CHKov2 (one of which is also truncated). Remarkably, the truncated allele of CHKov1 has previously been found to confer resistance to organophosphate insecticides. As estimates of the age of this allele predate the use of insecticides, it is likely that this allele initially functioned as a defence against viruses and fortuitously ""pre-adapted"" flies to insecticides. These results demonstrate that strong selection by parasites for increased host resistance can result in major genetic changes and rapid shifts in allele frequencies; and, contrary to the prevailing view that resistance to pathogens can be a costly trait to evolve, the pleiotropic effects of these changes can have unexpected benefits.",2011,"Michael M Magwire, Florian Bayer, Claire L Webster, Chuan Cao, Francis M Jiggins, Michael M Magwire, Florian Bayer, Claire L Webster, Chuan Cao, Francis M Jiggins"
Mitochondrial dysfunction associated with a mutation in the Notch3 gene in a CADASIL family,11591842,10.1212/wnl.57.7.1235,"Background:
      
    

    
      Cerebral autosomal arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is characterized by recurrent subcortical ischemic strokes and dementia caused by mutations in the Notch3 gene. In Drosophila melanogaster, Notch signaling has a pleiotropic effect, affecting most tissues of the organism during development.
    

    
  


        Objective:
      
    

    
      To characterize a potential mitochondrial dysfunction associated with mutations in the Notch3 gene.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Biochemical, histochemical, molecular, and genetic analyses were performed on muscle biopsy specimens and fibroblasts obtained from patients of a Spanish family with CADASIL. Additional biochemical and molecular analyses of the N(55e11) mutant of D. melanogaster were performed.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In muscle biopsy specimens, a significant decrease was found in the activity of complex I (NADH [reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide] dehydrogenase), and in one patient, histochemical analysis showed the presence of ragged-red fibers with abnormal cytochrome c oxidase staining. Reduced fibroblast activity of complex V (ATP synthase) was found. Supporting data on patients with CADASIL, it was found that the mutation N(55e11) in Drosophila decreases the activity of mitochondrial respiratory complexes I and V.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Mitochondrial respiratory chain activity responds, directly or indirectly, to the Notch signaling pathway. Mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with CADASIL may be an epiphenomenon, but results of this study suggest that the pathophysiology of the disease could include a defect in oxidative phosphorylation.",2001,"P de la Peña, B Bornstein, P del Hoyo, M A Fernández-Moreno, M A Martín, Y Campos, C Gómez-Escalonilla, J A Molina, A Cabello, J Arenas, R Garesse, P de la Peña, B Bornstein, P del Hoyo, M A Fernández-Moreno, M A Martín, Y Campos, C Gómez-Escalonilla, J A Molina, A Cabello, J Arenas, R Garesse"
Haemocyte changes in resistant and susceptible strains of D. melanogaster caused by virulent and avirulent strains of the parasitic wasp Leptopilina boulardi,11064023,10.1016/s0022-1910(00)00102-5,"Two strains of Drosophila melanogaster (resistant and susceptible) were parasitized by a virulent or avirulent strain of the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi. The success of encapsulation depends on both the genetic status of the host strain and the genetic status of the parasitoid strain: the immune cellular reaction (capsule) is observed only with the resistant strain-avirulent strain combination. The total numbers of host haemocytes increased in all 4 combinations, suggesting that an immune reaction was triggered in all hosts. Resistant host larvae infected with the virulent or avirulent strains of parasitoid wasp had slightly more haemocytes per mm(3) than did susceptible host larvae at the beginning of the reaction (less than 15 h post-parasitization). This difference disappeared later. Only the virulent parasitoid strain caused the production of a high percentage of altered lamellocytes (from a discoid shape to a bipolar shape), half the total number of lamellocytes are altered. This suggests that the alteration of lamellocyte shape alone is not sufficient to explain the lack of capsule formation seen in resistant hosts parasitized by the virulent strain. Lastly, there were very few altered lamellocytes in resistant or susceptible hosts parasitized by the avirulent parasitoid strain, two combinations in which no capsule was formed. As is now established for Drosophila-parasitoid interactions, virus-like particles contained in the long gland of the female wasp affect the morphology of the lamellocytes. The results presented here are further proof of the action (direct or indirect) of virus like particles of the virulent strain on lamellocytes.",2001,"J Russo, M Brehélin, Y Carton, J Russo, M Brehélin, Y Carton"
The heat shock 70 gene family in the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata,9662478,10.1111/j.1365-2583.1998.00073.x,"The cloning and the characterization of the heat shock 70 (hsp70) genes of the medfly C. capitata, a major agricultural pest, are presented. Six genomic clones were isolated by screening a medfly genomic library with an hsp70 genomic fragment of Drosophila melanogaster. They form two 30 kb contigs, both of which map cytogenetically in a single major heat shock puff (3L:24C) of the salivary gland polytene chromosomes. Restriction mapping and blot hybridization indicated the presence of six putative hsp70 genes in these two closely linked regions. The sequence of one of these genes suggests that it is a heat-inducible hsp70 gene. The 638-codon open reading frame shows 84% identity at the amino acid level (73.5% at the nucleotide level), relative to corresponding D. melanogaster sequences. The 5' untranslated leader sequence, approximately 200 bp long, is not interrupted by introns and is very rich (48%) in adenine residues, resembling Drosophila heat-inducible hsp70 genes. Furthermore, the promoter of this gene contains two characteristic heat shock elements close upstream from the TATA box. The levels of the hsp70 transcripts are very low at 25-30 degrees C, increase significantly at 33 degrees C and reach maximum at 39 degrees C.",1998,"E Papadimitriou, D Kritikou, M Mavroidis, A Zacharopoulou, A C Mintzas, E Papadimitriou, D Kritikou, M Mavroidis, A Zacharopoulou, A C Mintzas"
Transcriptionally repressed germ cells lack a subpopulation of phosphorylated RNA polymerase II in early embryos of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster,9187145,,"Early embryonic germ cells in C. elegans and D. melanogaster fail to express many messenger RNAs expressed in somatic cells. In contrast, we find that ribosomal RNAs are expressed in both cell types. We show that this deficiency in mRNA production correlates with the absence of a specific phosphoepitope on the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. In both C. elegans and Drosophila embryos, this phosphoepitope appears in somatic nuclei coincident with the onset of embryonic transcription, but remains absent from germ cells until these cells associate with the gut primordium during gastrulation. In contrast, a second distinct RNA polymerase II phosphoepitope is present continuously in both somatic and germ cells. The germ-line-specific factor PIE-1 is required to block mRNA production in the germ lineage of early C. elegans embryos (Seydoux, G., Mello, C. C., Pettitt, J., Wood, W. B., Priess, J. R. and Fire, A. (1996) Nature 382, 713-716). We show here that PIE-1 is also required for the germ-line-specific pattern of RNA polymerase II phosphorylation. These observations link inhibition of mRNA production in embryonic germ cells to a specific modification in the phosphorylation pattern of RNA polymerase II and suggest that repression of RNA polymerase II activity may be part of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that distinguishes germ line from soma during early embryogenesis. In addition, these studies also suggest that different phosphorylated isoforms of RNA polymerase II perform distinct functions.",1997,"G Seydoux, M A Dunn, G Seydoux, M A Dunn"
Effects of heavy metals on Drosophila larvae and a metallothionein cDNA,3086075,10.1289/ehp.8665107,"Drosophila melanogaster larvae reared on food containing radioactive cadmium retained over 80% of it, mostly in the intestinal epithelium. The majority of this radioactivity was associated with a soluble protein of less than 10,000 molecular weight. Synthesis of this cadmium-binding protein was induced by the metal as demonstrated by incorporation of radioactive cysteine. Most copper ingested by larvae was also found to associate with a low molecular weight, inducible protein, but some of it was found in an insoluble fraction. Zinc was unable to, or very inefficient at, binding or inducing the synthesis of a similar protein. A D. melanogaster cDNA clone was isolated based on its more intense hybridization to copies of RNA sequences from copper-fed larvae than from control larvae. This clone showed strong hybridization to mouse metallothionein-I cDNA at reduced stringency. Its nucleotide sequence includes an open-reading segment which codes for a 40-amino acid protein; this protein was identified as metallothionein based on its similarity to the amino-terminal portion of mammalian and crab metalloproteins. The ten cysteine residues present occur in five pairs of near-vicinal cysteines (Cys-X-Cys). This cDNA sequence hybridized to a 400-nucleotide polyadenylated RNA whose presence in the cells of the alimentary canal of larvae was stimulated by ingestion of cadmium or copper; in other tissues this RNA was present at much lower levels. Mercury, silver, and zinc induced metallothionein to a lesser extent. Whether (any of) the protein(s) discussed above correspond(s) to that coded by this RNA sequence has not yet been determined.",1986,"G Maroni, D Lastowski-Perry, E Otto, D Watson, G Maroni, D Lastowski-Perry, E Otto, D Watson"
Evaluating the effect of low dose rate of gamma rays in germ cells of Drosophila melanogaster,32338555,10.1080/09553002.2020.1761566,"Purpose: Evaluation of genetic risk in germ cells is still matter of research, mainly due to their role in the transmission of genetic information from one generation to another. Although numerous experiments have been carried out in Drosophila in order to study the effect of radiation on germ cells, the role of dose rate (DR) has not been fully explored. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the action of DR on the radioprotection induction on male germ cell of D. melanogaster.Material and method: The productivity and the sex-linked recessive lethal (SLRL) tests were used to evaluate the radio-sensitivity of different states of the germ line of males. Two-day-old males of Canton-S wild type strain were pretreated with 0.2 Gy at 5.4 or 34.3 Gy/h of gamma rays from a 60Co source, three hours later, they were irradiated with 20 Gy at 907.7 Gy/h. Thereafter, each single male was crossed with 3 five-day old Basc virgin females, that were replaced every other day by new females. This procedure was conducted three times, to test the whole germ cell stages.Results: Females crossed with males irradiated with 0.2 Gy at both DR tested, laid a higher number of eggs than control, but egg-viability was reduced. On the other hand, in the group of 0.2 Gy + 20 Gy -combined treatments- the total number of eggs laid decreased only when 0.2 Gy were delivered at 34.3 Gy/h however, the egg-viability increased. The dose of 0.2 Gy at both DR did not modify the baseline frequency of SLRL. A tendency to decrease in the frequency of lethals in brood III was found in combined treatments at both DR.Conclusion: The fact that 0.2 Gy at 5.4 or 34.3 Gy/h induced an increase in the egg-viability and a tendency to decrease the genetic damage in pre-meiotic cells provoked by 20 Gy, might indicate the induction of any mechanism that could be interpreted as radioprotection in male germ cells of D. melanogaster. Results emphasize the need to carry out more studies on the effect of the DR on the induction of genetic damage in germ cells.",2020,"Luz Ma Vidal, Emilio Pimentel, Martha P Cruces, Juan C Sánchez-Meza, Luz Ma Vidal, Emilio Pimentel, Martha P Cruces, Juan C Sánchez-Meza"
A dataset for assessing temporal changes in gene expression during the aging process of adult Drosophila melanogaster,27252981,10.1016/j.dib.2016.04.072,"A Drosophila melanogaster genome-wide transcriptome dataset is available for studies on temporal patterns of gene expression. Gene expression was measured using two-dye color oligonucleotide arrays derived from Version 2 of the Drosophila Genomics Resource Center. A total of 15,158 oligonucleotide probes corresponded to a high proportion of the coding genes in the genome. The source of the flies was a highly genetically heterogeneous population maintained in an overlapping generation population regime. This regime was designed to maintain life history traits so that they were similar to those found in natural populations. Flies collected for the cohorts were obtained in a short period of time in a carefully controlled manner before virgin females and males were allowed to mate. Mated females were introduced into two large population cages in unusually high numbers (approximately 12,000 per cage) for a Drosophila laboratory longevity study. Samples were taken weekly from each cohort for 11 weeks; only a small proportion of surviving flies were present at the last two collection time points and thus they were exceptionally old compared to those collected in early-to-midlife samples. The data set is useful for studies of temporal patterns of gene expression as flies age. The very large size of each cohort, and relatively frequent incidence of temporal samples, allows for a fine-scale study of gene expression from young to very old flies.",2016,"Kimberly A Carlson, Chi Zhang, Lawrence G Harshman, Kimberly A Carlson, Chi Zhang, Lawrence G Harshman"
"The Drosophila melanogaster Muc68E Mucin Gene Influences Adult Size, Starvation Tolerance, and Cold Recovery",27172221,10.1534/g3.116.029934,"Mucins have been implicated in many different biological processes, such as protection from mechanical damage, microorganisms, and toxic molecules, as well as providing a luminal scaffold during development. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that mucins have the potential to modulate food absorption as well, and thus contribute to the definition of several important phenotypic traits. Here we show that the Drosophila melanogaster Muc68E gene is 40- to 60-million-yr old, and is present in Drosophila species of the subgenus Sophophora only. The central repeat region of this gene is fast evolving, and shows evidence for repeated expansions/contractions. This and/or frequent gene conversion events lead to the homogenization of its repeats. The amino acid pattern P[ED][ED][ST][ST][ST] is found in the repeat region of Muc68E proteins from all Drosophila species studied, and can occur multiple times within a single conserved repeat block, and thus may have functional significance. Muc68E is a nonessential gene under laboratory conditions, but Muc68E mutant flies are smaller and lighter than controls at birth. However, at 4 d of age, Muc68E mutants are heavier, recover faster from chill-coma, and are more resistant to starvation than control flies, although they have the same percentage of lipids as controls. Mutant flies have enlarged abdominal size 1 d after chill-coma recovery, which is associated with higher lipid content. These results suggest that Muc68E has a role in metabolism modulation, food absorption, and/or feeding patterns in larvae and adults, and under normal and stress conditions. Such biological function is novel for mucin genes.",2016,"Micael Reis, Ana C Silva, Cristina P Vieira, Jorge Vieira, Micael Reis, Ana C Silva, Cristina P Vieira, Jorge Vieira"
Evolutionary Genomics of Genes Involved in Olfactory Behavior in the Drosophila melanogaster Species Group,22346339,10.4137/EBO.S8484,"Previous comparative genomic studies of genes involved in olfactory behavior in Drosophila focused only on particular gene families such as odorant receptor and/or odorant binding proteins. However, olfactory behavior has a complex genetic architecture that is orchestrated by many interacting genes. In this paper, we present a comparative genomic study of olfactory behavior in Drosophila including an extended set of genes known to affect olfactory behavior. We took advantage of the recent burst of whole genome sequences and the development of powerful statistical tools to analyze genomic data and test evolutionary and functional hypotheses of olfactory genes in the six species of the Drosophila melanogaster species group for which whole genome sequences are available. Our study reveals widespread purifying selection and limited incidence of positive selection on olfactory genes. We show that the pace of evolution of olfactory genes is mostly independent of the life cycle stage, and of the number of life cycle stages, in which they participate in olfaction. However, we detected a relationship between evolutionary rates and the position that the gene products occupy in the olfactory system, genes occupying central positions tend to be more constrained than peripheral genes. Finally, we demonstrate that specialization to one host does not seem to be associated with bursts of adaptive evolution in olfactory genes in D. sechellia and D. erecta, the two specialists species analyzed, but rather different lineages have idiosyncratic evolutionary histories in which both historical and ecological factors have been involved.",2012,"Nicolás Lavagnino, François Serra, Leonardo Arbiza, Hernán Dopazo, Esteban Hasson, Nicolás Lavagnino, François Serra, Leonardo Arbiza, Hernán Dopazo, Esteban Hasson"
The protein phosphatases of Drosophila melanogaster and their inhibitors,3030753,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1987.tb10988.x,"Protein phosphatases-1, 2A and 2B have been identified in membrane and soluble fractions of Drosophila melanogaster heads. Similarities between Drosophila and mammalian protein phosphatase-1 included specificity for the beta subunit of phosphorylase kinase, sensitivity to inhibitor-1 and inhibitor-2, inhibition by protamine, retention by heparin-Sepharose and selective interaction with membranes. In addition, an inactive form of protein phosphatase-1, termed protein phosphatase-1I, was detected in the soluble fraction that could be activated by preincubation with MgATP and mammalian glycogen synthase kinase-3. Inhibitor-2 partially purified from Drosophila had an identical molecular mass to its mammalian counterpart, and recombined with mammalian protein phosphatase-1 to form a hybrid protein phosphatase-1I. Similarities between Drosophila and mammalian protein phosphatase-2A included preferential dephosphorylation of the alpha subunit of phosphorylase kinase, insensitivity to inhibitors-1 and -2, activation by protamine, exclusion from heparin-Sepharose and apparent molecular mass. A Ca2+-dependent calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase (protein phosphatase-2B) that was inhibited by trifluoperazine was identified in the soluble fraction. The remarkable similarities between Drosophila protein phosphatases and their mammalian counterparts are indicative of strict phylogenetic conservation and demonstrate that the procedures used to classify mammalian protein phosphatases have a wider application. Characterisation of the Drosophila phosphatases will facilitate genetic analysis of dephosphorylation systems and their possible roles in neuronal and behavioural plasticity in Drosophila.",1987,"S Orgad, Y Dudai, P Cohen, S Orgad, Y Dudai, P Cohen"
Calcium Imaging in Drosophila melanogaster,31646538,10.1007/978-3-030-12457-1_35,"Drosophila melanogaster, colloquially known as the fruit fly, is one of the most commonly used model organisms in scientific research. Although the final architecture of a fly and a human differs greatly, most of the fundamental biological mechanisms and pathways controlling development and survival are conserved through evolution between the two species. For this reason, Drosophila has been productively used as a model organism for over a century, to study a diverse range of biological processes, including development, learning, behavior and aging. Ca2+ signaling comprises complex pathways that impact on virtually every aspect of cellular physiology. Within such a complex field of study, Drosophila offers the advantages of consolidated molecular and genetic techniques, lack of genetic redundancy and a completely annotated genome since 2000. These and other characteristics provided the basis for the identification of many genes encoding Ca2+ signaling molecules and the disclosure of conserved Ca2+ signaling pathways.

Parallel Genomic Engineering of Two Drosophila Genes Using Orthogonal attB/attP Sites,30065043,10.1534/g3.118.200565,"Precise modification of sequences in the Drosophila melanogaster genome underlies the powerful capacity to study molecular structure-function relationships in this model species. The emergence of CRISPR/Cas9 tools in combination with recombinase systems such as the bacteriophage serine integrase ΦC31 has rendered Drosophila mutagenesis a straightforward enterprise for deleting, inserting and modifying genetic elements to study their functional relevance. However, while combined modifications of non-linked genetic elements can be easily constructed with these tools and classical genetics, the independent manipulation of linked genes through the established ΦC31-mediated transgenesis pipeline has not been feasible due to the limitation to one attB/attP site pair. Here we extend the repertoire of ΦC31 transgenesis by introducing a second pair of attB/attP targeting and transgenesis vectors that operate in parallel and independently of existing tools. We show that two syntenic orthologous genes, CG11318 and CG15556, located within a 25 kb region can be genomically engineered to harbor attPTT and attPCC sites. These landing pads can then independently receive transgenes through ΦC31-assisted integration and facilitate the manipulation and analysis of either gene in the same animal. These results expand the repertoire of site-specific genomic engineering in Drosophila while retaining the well established advantages and utility of the ΦC31 transgenesis system.",2018,"Beatriz Blanco-Redondo, Tobias Langenhan, Beatriz Blanco-Redondo, Tobias Langenhan"
ADAR RNA editing below the backbone,28559490,10.1261/rna.060921.117,"ADAR RNA editing enzymes (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) that convert adenosine bases to inosines were first identified biochemically 30 years ago. Since then, studies on ADARs in genetic model organisms, and evolutionary comparisons between them, continue to reveal a surprising range of pleiotropic biological effects of ADARs. This review focuses on Drosophila melanogaster, which has a single Adar gene encoding a homolog of vertebrate ADAR2 that site-specifically edits hundreds of transcripts to change individual codons in ion channel subunits and membrane and cytoskeletal proteins. Drosophila ADAR is involved in the control of neuronal excitability and neurodegeneration and, intriguingly, in the control of neuronal plasticity and sleep. Drosophila ADAR also interacts strongly with RNA interference, a key antiviral defense mechanism in invertebrates. Recent crystal structures of human ADAR2 deaminase domain-RNA complexes help to interpret available information on Drosophila ADAR isoforms and on the evolution of ADARs from tRNA deaminase ADAT proteins.

Unique transposon landscapes are pervasive across Drosophila melanogaster genomes,26578579,10.1093/nar/gkv1193,"To understand how transposon landscapes (TLs) vary across animal genomes, we describe a new method called the Transposon Insertion and Depletion AnaLyzer (TIDAL) and a database of >300 TLs in Drosophila melanogaster (TIDAL-Fly). Our analysis reveals pervasive TL diversity across cell lines and fly strains, even for identically named sub-strains from different laboratories such as the ISO1 strain used for the reference genome sequence. On average, >500 novel insertions exist in every lab strain, inbred strains of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), and fly isolates in the Drosophila Genome Nexus (DGN). A minority (<25%) of transposon families comprise the majority (>70%) of TL diversity across fly strains. A sharp contrast between insertion and depletion patterns indicates that many transposons are unique to the ISO1 reference genome sequence. Although TL diversity from fly strains reaches asymptotic limits with increasing sequencing depth, rampant TL diversity causes unsaturated detection of TLs in pools of flies. Finally, we show novel transposon insertions negatively correlate with Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) levels for most transposon families, except for the highly-abundant roo retrotransposon.

Both piRNA and siRNA pathways are silencing transcripts of the suffix element in the Drosophila melanogaster germline and somatic cells,21779345,10.1371/journal.pone.0021882,"In the Drosophila melanogaster germline, the piRNA pathway silences retrotransposons as well as other transcribed repetitive elements. Suffix is an unusual short retroelement that was identified both as an actively transcribed repetitive element and also as an element at the 3' ends of the Drosophila non-LTR F element. The copies of suffix that are F element-independent are far more actively transcribed than their counterparts on the F element. We studied the patterns of small RNAs targeting both strands of suffix in Drosophila ovaries using an RNase protection assay and the analysis of the corresponding RNA sequences from the libraries of total small RNAs. Our results indicate that suffix sense and antisense transcripts are targeted mainly by 23-29 nucleotides in length piRNAs and also by 21 nucleotides in length siRNAs. Suffix sense transcripts actively form longer RNA species, corresponding either to partial digestion products of the RNAi and Piwi pathways or to another RNA silencing mechanism. Both sense and antisense suffix transcripts accumulated in the ovaries of homozygous spn-E, piwi and aub mutants.

Here, with the molecular cloning of Painting of fourth (Pof), we describe a previously uncharacterized gene encoding a chromosome-specific protein in Drosophila. Unlike the MSL proteins, POF paints an autosome, the fourth chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster. Chromosome translocation analysis shows that the binding depends on an initiation site in the proximal region of chromosome 4 and spreads in cis to involve the entire chromosome. The spreading depends on sequences or structures specific to chromosome 4 and cannot extend to parts of other chromosomes translocated to the fourth. Spreading can also occur in trans to a paired homologue that lacks the initiation region. In the related species Drosophila busckii, POF paints the entire X chromosome exclusively in males, suggesting relationships between the fourth chromosome and the X and between POF complexes and dosage-compensation complexes.",2001,"J Larsson, J D Chen, V Rasheva, A Rasmuson-Lestander, V Pirrotta, J Larsson, J D Chen, V Rasheva, A Rasmuson-Lestander, V Pirrotta"
An element with palindromic structure is required for the expression of TBP (TATA box-binding protein) gene in Drosophila melanogaster,10672937,,"Previously we showed that the 5'-flanking regions between -261 and -207 of the Drosophila melanogaster TBP (TATA box binding protein) gene is important for its expression.

We found that the 16 bp deletion from -261 to -245 greatly reduces the promoter activity of the Drosophila TBP gene. The 16 bp DNA element contains half of a 11 bp long palindromic sequence, CTTTT-GAAAAG. Disruption of the palindromic sequence by site-directed mutagenesis severely affected promoter activity. In addition, the electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that the oligonucleotide containing the palindromic sequence can make specific DNA/protein complexes when it was mixed with the Drosophila nuclear extract, suggesting that it interacts with nuclear protein(s).

Effect of melatonin and pineal peptide preparation epithalamin on life span and free radical oxidation in Drosophila melanogaster,9226628,10.1016/s0047-6374(97)01897-6,"It was shown previously that epithalamin delays age-related changes in reproductive and immune systems and increases the life span of mice and rats. These effects could be mediated by stimulating influences of epithalamin on synthesis and secretion of melatonin and on free radical processes. A comparative study on the effect of epithalamin and melatonin on both the life span of Drosophila melanogaster (strain HEM) and on the intensity of lipid peroxidation and activity of antioxidative enzymes in their tissues was the main aim of this work. Melatonin and epithalamin was added to the nutrition medium (100 micrograms/ml) during 2-3rd age of larvas. For survival analysis the flies were passed (five coupes per vessel) each 3-7 days. Lipid peroxidation was evaluated as the level of ketodienes (KD) and conjugated hydroperoxides (CHP) in fly tissues at the age of 11 days. Activity of Cu, Zn-superoxide dismuatse (SOD) and catalase was evaluated as well. The mean, median and maximum life span (MLS) were estimated. Mortality rate (MR) was calculated as alpha in the Gompertz equation (R = Ro (exp alpha t) and mortality rate doubling time (MRDT) as in 2/alpha. These parameters in groups of male and female flies exposed to melatonin and in male flies exposed to epithalamin were no different from the parameters for controls. However, exposure to epithalamin was followed in females by a significant increase in mean life span (by 17%, P < 0.02), of median (by 26%), of MLS by 14% and by a 2.12 times decrease of MR (P < 0.01) and MRDT (by 32%) compared with female controls. The level of CHP and KD in the tissues of male control flies was 40 and 49% less than that in females and indirectly correlates with male life span. Exposure to melatonin was followed by a decrease in the level of CHP and KD in females and the deletion of sex differences in them. Exposure to epithalamin significantly decreased the level of CHP and KD in female flies compared to controls (2.3 and 3.4 times, respectively, P < 0.001). Exposure to melatonin failed to influence the activity of catalase in males but increased it in females by 24% (P < 0.02) and failed to influence SOD activity both in males and females. Exposure to epithalamin was followed by a significant increase in activity of catalse, 20% in males and 7% in females and by an increase in SOD activity in males (41%). Thus, it was shown that exposure to epithalamin significantly increases the mean life span and MLS of female D.melanogaster and slowed down their aging rate by 2.12 times. This effect is in good agreement with the inhibiting effect of epithalamin in lipid peroxidation processes in fly tissues.",1997,"V N Anisimov, S V Mylnikov, T I Oparina, V K Khavinson, V N Anisimov, S V Mylnikov, T I Oparina, V K Khavinson"
Oskar controls morphology of polar granules and nuclear bodies in Drosophila,17151014,10.1242/dev.02729,"Germ cell formation in Drosophila relies on polar granules, which are large ribonucleoprotein complexes found at the posterior end of the embryo. The granules undergo characteristic changes in morphology during development, including the assembly of multiple spherical bodies from smaller precursors. Several polar granule components, both protein and RNA, have been identified. One of these, the protein Oskar, acts to initiate granule formation during oogenesis and to recruit other granule components. To investigate whether Oskar has a continuing role in organization of the granules and control of their morphology, we took advantage of species-specific differences in polar granule structure. The polar granules of D. immigrans fuse into a single large oblong aggregate, as opposed to the multiple, distinct, spherical granules of D. melanogaster embryos. D. immigrans oskar rescues the body patterning and pole cell defects of embryos from D. melanogaster oskar(-) mothers, and converts the morphology of the polar granules to that of D. immigrans. The nuclear bodies, which are structures that appear to be closely related to polar granules, are also converted to the D. immigrans type morphology. We conclude that oskar plays a persistent and central role in the polar granules, not only initiating their formation but also controlling their organization and morphology.",2007,"Jennifer R Jones, Paul M Macdonald, Jennifer R Jones, Paul M Macdonald"
Evolution of 5S rRNA gene families in Drosophila,11448042,10.1023/a:1016787602583,"In Drosophila virilis, the three clusters of 5S rRNA genes on chromosome 5 comprise two different gene families (B and C), which differ profoundly in the organization of their spacer sequences. While C-type genes, which are found in two of the clusters, exhibit a true repetitive character, the B-type genes of the third cluster are each embedded in completely different genomic environments. Southern blots of genomic DNA of different D. virilis subspecies, D. hydei and D. melanogaster probed with 5S rRNA gene spacer and coding sequences demonstrate the specificity of C-type sequences for the D. virilis species group. The comparative analysis of flanking sequences of 5S rRNA genes of D. virilis, members of the D. melanogaster species subgroup and of the blowfly Calliphora erythrocephala reveals the existence of conserved sequence motifs both in the 5' upstream and 3' downstream flanking regions.

Oviposition-site preference in Drosophila following interspecific gene transfer of the Alcohol dehydrogenase locus,10547927,10.1023/a:1021648103496,"The preference of Drosophila females to lay eggs on substrates that do or do not contain alcohol is an excellent system to study the evolutionary genetics of behavior, because (1) there is variation in this behavior within and among species, (2) the behavior is amenable to laboratory investigation, and (3) the behavior presumably has a direct relationship to reproductive fitness. Moreover, a key genetic component of the system, the Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) locus, is arguably the most well characterized gene known. However, because the Adh gene and its genetic background are inseparable in reproductively isolated species, it is difficult to establish its role in behavioral divergence. By transgene coplacement, we created pairs of strains of D. melanogaster expressing an Adh allele from either D. melanogaster or D. affinidisjuncta, a Hawaiian species with very low levels of ADH in adults. When raised on ethanol-containing medium, the affinidisjuncta-Adh strains experience high mortality relative to the melanogaster-Adh strains. However, affinidisjuncta-Adh females show the same preference for oviposition on ethanol-containing medium as melanogaster-Adh females. Thus, preference for ethanol in these strains is not determined primarily by Adh genotype.",1999,"M L Siegal, D L Hartl, M L Siegal, D L Hartl"
Cytochrome P450s Cyp4p1 and Cyp4p2 associated with the DDT tolerance in the Drosophila melanogaster strain 91-R,31400775,10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.06.008,"Cytochrome P450s are part of a super-gene family that has undergone gene duplication, divergence, over-expression and, in some cases, loss of function. One such case is the 91-R and 91-C strains of common origin, in Drosophila melanogaster, whereby 91-R (DDT resistant strain) overexpresses Cyp4p1 and Cyp4p2 and both genes are lost in 91-C (DDT susceptible strain). In this study, we used a comparative approach to demonstrate that transcription of Cyp4p1 and Cyp4p2 were constitutively up-regulated in the Drosophila melanogaster strain 91-R as compared to another DDT susceptible strain Canton-S which does not have a loss of function of these genes. Furthermore, significantly increased expression of Cyp4p1 and Cyp4p2 was induced in 91-R in response to sublethal DDT exposure, however, such induction did not occur in the DDT treated Canton-S. Additionally, fixed nucleotide variation within putative transcription factor binding sites of Cyp4p1 and Cyp4p2 promoters were observed between 91-R and Canton-S, however, their impact on transcription remains to be determined. Two GAL4/UAS transgenic strains with integrated heat shock-inducible Cyp4p1- or Cyp4p2-RNAi constructs within wild-type genetic backgrounds were developed. Following heat shock induction of Cyp4p1 and Cyp4p2 knockdown, these transgenic lines showed increased DDT mortality as compared to their corresponding non-heat shock controls. These results provide a functional link of Cyp4p1 and Cyp4p2 in conferring tolerance to DDT exposure.",2019,"Keon Mook Seong, Brad S Coates, Barry R Pittendrigh, Keon Mook Seong, Brad S Coates, Barry R Pittendrigh"
"Molecular typing and phylogeny of Wolbachia: A study from Assam, North-Eastern part of India",28939497,10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.09.005,"Background:
      
    

    
      Wolbachia are maternally inherited endosymbiotic alphaproteobacteria, infecting 40-75% of arthropod species. Knowledge on distribution of native strains infecting mosquito vectors from endemic regions is essential for successful implementation of vector control interventions utilizing potential strains of Wolbachia. Study identified various native strains of Wolbachia inhabiting different mosquito species from field and colonised conditions of Assam. The fly Drosophila melanogaster was also included in our study.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Different mosquito species collected from field viz; Aedes albopictus, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles hyrcanus, Anopheles annularis, Culex vishnui, Toxorhynchites splendens, Armegeries obturbans and fly Drosophila melanogaster were included in the study. Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus were obtained from RMRC, Dibrugarh mosquito colony y for Wolbachia screening. DNA was extracted from these species, amplified using group specific wsp primers followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Aedes albopictus from Dibrugarh, Tinsukia and Sivasagar district showed superinfection with A and B group of Wolbachia but, Aedes albopictus from Tezpur district presented infection with A group only. Our study reports for the first time natural infection of Wolbachia A and B group from colonised Anopheles stephensi mosquito but reported no infection from field collected Anopheles hyrcanus or Anopheles annularis. Similarly Armigeres obturbans and Culex vishnui presented infection with only B group of Wolbachia. Drosophila melanogaster showed superinfection with A and B group. Toxorhynchites splendens, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus reported no infection with Wolbachia.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      To the best of our knowledge this is the first study on Wolbachia screening from Northeast part of India and also first report of natural Wolbachia infection from colonised Anopheles stephensi species. The current understanding on distribution of Wolbachia strains naturally present within insect species from this geographical region should aid future Wolbachia mediated vector control strategies.",2017,"Monika Soni, Chandrakanta Bhattacharya, Jitendra Sharma, Siraj Ahmed Khan, Prafulla Dutta, Monika Soni, Chandrakanta Bhattacharya, Jitendra Sharma, Siraj Ahmed Khan, Prafulla Dutta"
Relationship between benzo(a)pyrene-DNA adducts and somatic mutation and recombination in Drosophila melanogaster,8162890,10.1002/em.2850230304,"The evaluation of the relationship between the dose to DNA of a mutagen/carcinogen and in vivo somatic cell mutagenesis may provide information on the mechanisms leading to induced mutational events. This can be achieved, for example, by coupling test systems that permit the detection of somatic mutation and recombination on the basis of phenotypic changes in cuticular structures of Drosophila melanogaster, with methods for the quantitation of carcinogen-DNA adducts such as the 32P-postlabeling technique. In this article, we evaluate the quantitative relationship between BaP-DNA adduct formation, determined by 32P-postlabeling, and the induction of mutant cells in the wing marker version of the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster. The total single clones in the trans-heterozygous mwh/flr3 flies show a linear relationship with the BaP-DNA adduct levels, suggesting a single hit mechanism for the genetic damage giving rise to this type of clones. In contrast, the twin clones (which are of recombinational origin) display a linear-quadratic relationship with the adduct levels, suggesting that multiple hits may be involved in generating these clones. The total single clones in the mwh/TM3, Ser flies (in which mitotic recombination is suppressed) show a logarithmic relationship with the adduct levels. The discussion of these data in terms of the pathways that may be involved in the repair of the BaP-DNA adducts leads to the suggestion that in Drosophila melanogaster the repair of Bap metabolite-DNA adducts in somatic cells may proceed, in large part, via post-replicative recombinational repair.",1994,"M Zordan, M Osti, S Pavanello, R Costa, A G Levis, M Zordan, M Osti, S Pavanello, R Costa, A G Levis"
The auxin-inducible degradation system enables conditional PERIOD protein depletion in the nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster,30321477,10.1111/febs.14677,"Tools that allow inducible and reversible depletion of target proteins are critical for biological studies. The plant-derived auxin-inducible degradation system (AID) enables the degradation of target proteins tagged with the AID motif. This system has been recently employed in mammalian cells as well as in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila. To test the utility of the AID approach in the nervous system, we used circadian locomotor rhythms as a model and applied the AID method to temporally and spatially degrade PERIOD (PER), a critical pacemaker protein in Drosophila. We found that the period locus can be efficiently tagged with the AID motif by CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing without disrupting PER function. Moreover, we demonstrated that the AID system could be used to induce rapid and efficient protein degradation in the nervous system as shown by effects on circadian and sleep behaviors. Furthermore, the protein degradation by AID was rapidly reversible after auxin removal. Together, our results show that the AID system provides a powerful tool for behavior studies in Drosophila.",2018,"Wenfeng Chen, Michelle Werdann, Yong Zhang, Wenfeng Chen, Michelle Werdann, Yong Zhang"

In order to highlight the potential value of the collection for the characterisation of human synaptic genes we also use two assays, investigating any gain-of-function motor and/or cognitive phenotypes in the strains in this collection. Using these assays we show that among the strains made there are both types of gain-of-function phenotypes investigated. As an example, we focus on the three strains expressing human tyrosine protein kinase Fyn, the small GTPase Rap1a and human Arc, respectively.

Iron absorption in Drosophila melanogaster,23686013,10.3390/nu5051622,"The way in which Drosophila melanogaster acquires iron from the diet remains poorly understood despite iron absorption being of vital significance for larval growth. To describe the process of organismal iron absorption, consideration needs to be given to cellular iron import, storage, export and how intestinal epithelial cells sense and respond to iron availability. Here we review studies on the Divalent Metal Transporter-1 homolog Malvolio (iron import), the recent discovery that Multicopper Oxidase-1 has ferroxidase activity (iron export) and the role of ferritin in the process of iron acquisition (iron storage). We also describe what is known about iron regulation in insect cells. We then draw upon knowledge from mammalian iron homeostasis to identify candidate genes in flies. Questions arise from the lack of conservation in Drosophila for key mammalian players, such as ferroportin, hepcidin and all the components of the hemochromatosis-related pathway. Drosophila and other insects also lack erythropoiesis. Thus, systemic iron regulation is likely to be conveyed by different signaling pathways and tissue requirements.

Genetic approaches to study aging in Drosophila melanogaster,23598651,10.1007/s11357-005-2919-9,"The process of aging can be described as a progressive decline in an organism's function that invariably results in death. This decline results from the activities of intrinsic genetic factors within an organism. The relative contributions of the biological and environmental components to senescence are hard to measure, however different strategies have been devised in Drosophila melanogaster to isolate and identify genetic influences on aging. These strategies include selective breeding, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and single gene mutant analysis. Selective breeding effectively demonstrated a genetic, heritable component to aging while QTL mapping located regions within the Drosophila genome carrying loci that influence the aging process. Within the past decade, single gene mutant analysis has facilitated the identification of specific genes whose activities play a determinative role in Drosophila aging. This review will focus on the application of selective breeding, QTL mapping and single gene mutant analysis used in Drosophila to study aging as well as the results obtained through these strategies to date.",2005,"Luc Poirier, Laurent Seroude, Luc Poirier, Laurent Seroude"
Human SRCAP and Drosophila melanogaster DOM are homologs that function in the notch signaling pathway,16024792,10.1128/MCB.25.15.6559-6569.2005,"The putative ATPase chromatin-remodeling machine SRCAP was identified in a yeast two-hybrid protein screen by interaction with the histone acetylase CBP. SRCAP is implicated in the transcriptional coactivation of cyclic AMP- and steroid-dependent promoters, but no natural chromosomal targets for SRCAP regulation have been identified. DOM is the unique SRCAP homolog in Drosophila melanogaster. The goal of this study was to test whether SRCAP is a functional homolog of DOM and to identify potential activities and targets of SRCAP in vivo. We show that human SRCAP complements recessive domino mutant phenotypes. This rescue depends on an intact ATPase homology domain. SRCAP colocalizes extensively with DOM on Drosophila polytene chromosomes and is recruited to sites of active transcription, such as steroid-regulated loci, but not to activated heat shock loci. We show that SRCAP recruits Drosophila CBP to ectopic chromosomal sites, providing the first evidence to suggest that SRCAP and CBP interact directly or indirectly on chromosomes. We show that DOM is a Notch pathway activator in Drosophila and that wild-type SRCAP-but not an ATPase domain mutant-can substitute for DOM in Notch-dependent wing development. We show that SRCAP potentiates Notch-dependent gene activation in HeLa cells.

Characterization of the short neuropeptide F receptor from Drosophila melanogaster,12372405,10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02351-3,"A seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor has been cloned from Drosophila melanogaster.

In locusts, they accelerate ovarian maturation, and in mosquitoes, they inhibit host-seeking behavior. Expression analysis by RT-PCR shows that the sNPF receptor (Drm-sNPF-R) is present in several tissues (brain, gut, Malpighian tubules and fat body) from Drosophila larvae as well as in ovaries of adult females. All 4 Drosophila sNPFs clearly elicited a calcium response in receptor expressing mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cells. The response is dose-dependent and appeared to be very specific. The short NPF receptor was not activated by any of the other tested arthropod peptides, not even by FMRFamide-related peptides (also ending in RFamide), indicating that the Arg residue at position 4 from the amidated C-terminus appears to be crucial for the response elicited by the sNPFs.",2002,"Inge Mertens, Tom Meeusen, Roger Huybrechts, Arnold De Loof, Liliane Schoofs, Inge Mertens, Tom Meeusen, Roger Huybrechts, Arnold De Loof, Liliane Schoofs"
"Dissociation of photoreceptors from whole heads of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster",7781044,10.1007/BF00307821,"Photoreceptor cells that were mostly free of extracellular material and suitable for most electrophysiological study procedures were dissociated from whole heads of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, by a simple ""smash"" technique employing gentle chopping by a razor blade through Parafilm sheets. A variety of commonly available proteolytic and glycolytic digestion enzymes were tested as additions to the basic dissociation procedure described. With the aid of Nomarski interference contrast optics, periodic acid-Schiff staining, and fluorescent labeling and microscopy methods, it was determined that proteolytic enzymatic digestion does little to enhance the dissociation procedure, and instead, often damages the cells that one is attempting to recover. Unexpectedly, certain glycolytic enzymes, when added to the basic procedure, appear to enhance the recovery of intact viable Drosophila photoreceptors that are stripped of most extracellular material. Based on these results, a hypothesis concerning the biochemical nature of the extracellular matrix of the Drosophila retina is proposed. Drosophila photoreceptors are an interesting model system for the study of invertebrate phototransduction and photoreceptor cell biology because of their many well-characterized mutant strains.

Sepiapterin reductase and the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin in Drosophila melanogaster,7951268,10.1016/0965-1748(94)90019-1,"Ammonium sulfate fractionation and standard column chromatography techniques have been used to purify the enzyme sepiapterin reductase to electrophoretic homogeneity from pupae of Drosophila melanogaster. This purification constitutes a 1000-fold increase in the specific activity of the enzyme. The native molecular weight of the enzyme was determined to be ca 67,000 Da, while the subunit molecular weight is estimated to be 36,000-39,000 Da. The apparent Km for 6-lactoyltetrahydropterin (lactoyl-H4pterin) is 50 microns. The Drosophila enzyme is sensitive to inhibition by the biogenic amine, N-acetyl serotonin, and (to a lesser extent) melatonin, but its activity is not affected by serotonin, epinephrine or norepinephrine. The enzyme was shown to be an integral component of the Drosophila enzyme system which functions in catalyzing the conversion of dihydroneopterin triphosphate (H2NTP) to (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4biopterin).

Synthesis and secretion of salivary gland proteins in Drosophila gibberosa during larval and prepupal development,28305598,10.1007/BF00375929,"The late larvae of Drosophila gibberosa Patterson and Mainland choose different pupariation sites than the larvae of Drosophila melanogaster Meigen. Since the larvae of D. gibberosa do not attach themselves to the substratum, the salivary glands contain only a small amount of the ""glue"" proteins before pupariation. Proteins comprising the salivary gland secretions of late larvae of these two species were compared and found to be qualitatively quite different. Only five polypeptides with the same molecular masses were identified in both species. The rate of protein synthesis in the salivary glands of D. gibberosa continued to increase through the late larval stage and pupariation. As a consequence, the total amount of protein contained in the salivary glands also continued to increase after pupariation. To demonstrate temporal changes in protein synthesis from 48 h before pupariation to 28 h after pupariation, newly synthesized polypeptides were pulse labeled by culturing salivary glands in vitro. The patterns of polypeptide synthesis fell into four major groups depending upon whether the synthesis of a protein stopped shortly after pupariation, stopped during late pupariation, increased at pupariation, or was initiated after pupariation. Changing patterns of protein synthesis are correlated with the known changes in gene puffing during this developmental period.",1988,"Paul David Shirk, Paul Alfred Roberts, Chee Hark Harn, Paul David Shirk, Paul Alfred Roberts, Chee Hark Harn"

For each of the five genes examined--those coding for hsp27, hsp26, hsp23, hsp70, and hsp83--the DNase I-hypersensitive sites in Drosophila melanogaster nuclei mapped to two regions upstream of the coding region. These sites occurred on the average, 115 and 17 base pairs upstream from the start of transcription of the five heat shock genes examined. This latter site corresponded to sequences at or near the TATA consensus sequence. Sites even further upstream of the hsp27, hsp26, and hsp83 genes were also evident. Additionally, for the two genes examined--hsp70 and hsp83--the DNase I-hypersensitive sites were preserved, at least within this level of resolution (+/- 10 base pairs), when the Drosophila genes were integrated into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome.

Drosophila innate immunity: regional and functional specialization of prophenoloxidases,26437768,10.1186/s12915-015-0193-6,"Background:
      
    

    
      The diversification of immune systems during evolution involves the expansion of particular gene families in given phyla. A better understanding of the metazoan immune system requires an analysis of the logic underlying such immune gene amplification. This analysis is now within reach due to the ease with which we can generate multiple mutations in an organism. In this paper, we analyze the contribution of the three Drosophila prophenoloxidases (PPOs) to host defense by generating single, double and triple mutants. PPOs are enzymes that catalyze the production of melanin at the site of infection and around parasites. They are the rate-limiting enzymes that contribute to the melanization reaction, a major immune mechanism of arthropods. The number of PPO-encoding genes is variable among insects, ranging from one in the bee to ten in the mosquito.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      By analyzing mutations alone and in combination, we ascribe a specific function to each of the three PPOs of Drosophila. Our study confirms that two PPOs produced by crystal cells, PPO1 and PPO2, contribute to the bulk of melanization in the hemolymph, upon septic or clean injury. In contrast, PPO3, a PPO restricted to the D. melanogaster group, is expressed in lamellocytes and contributes to melanization during the encapsulation process. Interestingly, another overlapping set of PPOs, PPO2 and PPO3, achieve melanization of the capsule upon parasitoid wasp infection.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The use of single or combined mutations allowed us to show that each PPO mutant has a specific phenotype, and that knocking out two of three genes is required to abolish fully a particular function. Thus, Drosophila PPOs have partially overlapping functions to optimize melanization in at least two conditions: following injury or during encapsulation. Since PPO3 is restricted to the D. melanogaster group, this suggests that production of PPO by lamellocytes emerged as a recent defense mechanism against parasitoid wasps. We conclude that differences in spatial localization, immediate or late availability, and mode of activation underlie the functional diversification of the three Drosophila PPOs, with each of them having non-redundant but overlapping functions.",2015,"Jan P Dudzic, Shu Kondo, Ryu Ueda, Casey M Bergman, Bruno Lemaitre, Jan P Dudzic, Shu Kondo, Ryu Ueda, Casey M Bergman, Bruno Lemaitre"
Dynamics expression of DmFKBP12/Calstabin during embryonic early development of Drosophila melanogaster,30637096,10.1186/s13578-019-0270-6,"Background:
      
    

    
      Calcium signaling are conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates and plays critical roles in many molecular mechanisms of embryogenesis and postnatal development. As a critical component of the signaling pathway, the RyR medicated calcium-induced calcium release signaling system, has been well studied along with their regulator FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12/Calstabin). Lack of FKBP12 is known to result in lethal cardiac dysfunction in mouse. However, precisely how FKBP12 is regulated and effects calcium signaling in Drosophila melanogaster remains largely unknown.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In this study, we identified both temporal and localization changes in expression of DmFKBP12, a translational and transcriptional regulator of Drosophila RyR (DmRyR) and FKBP12, through embryonic development. DmFKBP12 is first expressed at the syncytial blastoderm stage and undergoes increased expression during the cellular blastoderm and early gastrulation stages. At late gastrulation, DmFKBP12 expression begins to decline until it reaches homeostasis, which it then maintains throughout the rest of development. Throughout these described changes in expression, DmFKBP12 mRNA remain stable, which indicates that protein dynamics are attributed to regulation at the mRNA to protein translation level. In addition to temporal changes in expression, dynamic expression profiles during Drosophila development also revealed DmFKBP12 localization. Although DmFKBP12 is distributed evenly between the anterior to posterior poles of the blastoderm egg, the protein is expressed more strongly in the cortex of the early Drosophila gastrula with the highest concentration found in the basement membrane of the cellular blastoderm. Fertilized egg, through the profile as under-membrane cortex distribution concentering onto basement at cellular blastoderm, to the profile as three-gem layer localization in primitive neuronal and digestion architecture of early Drosophila gastrula. By late gastrulation, DmFKBP12 is no longer identified in the yolk or lumen of duct structures and has relocated to the future brain (suboesophageal and supraesophageal ganglions), ventral nervous system, and muscular system. Throughout these changes in distribution, in situ DmFKBP12 mRNA monitoring detected equal distribution of DmFKBP12 mRNA, once again indicating that regulation of DmFKBP12 occurs at the translational level in Drosophila development.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      As a critical regulator of the DmRyR-FKBP complex, DmFKBP12 expression in Drosophila fluctuates temporally and geographically with the formation of organ systems. These finding indicate that DmFKBP12 and RyR associated calcium signaling plays an essential role in the successful development of Drosophila melanogaster.

Drosophila adiponectin receptor in insulin producing cells regulates glucose and lipid metabolism by controlling insulin secretion,23874700,10.1371/journal.pone.0068641,"Adipokines secreted from adipose tissue are key regulators of metabolism in animals. Adiponectin, one of the adipokines, modulates pancreatic beta cell function to maintain energy homeostasis. Recently, significant conservation between Drosophila melanogaster and mammalian metabolism has been discovered. Drosophila insulin like peptides (Dilps) regulate energy metabolism similarly to mammalian insulin. However, in Drosophila, the regulatory mechanism of insulin producing cells (IPCs) by adipokine signaling is largely unknown. Here, we describe the discovery of the Drosophila adiponectin receptor and its function in IPCs. Drosophila adiponectin receptor (dAdipoR) has high homology with the human adiponectin receptor 1. The dAdipoR antibody staining revealed that dAdipoR was expressed in IPCs of larval and adult brains. IPC- specific dAdipoR inhibition (Dilp2>dAdipoR-Ri) showed the increased sugar level in the hemolymph and the elevated triglyceride level in whole body. Dilps mRNA levels in the Dilp2>dAdipoR-Ri flies were similar with those of controls. However, in the Dilp2>dAdipoR-Ri flies, Dilp2 protein was accumulated in IPCs, the level of circulating Dilp2 was decreased, and insulin signaling was reduced in the fat body. In ex vivo fly brain culture with the human adiponectin, Dilp2 was secreted from IPCs. These results indicate that adiponectin receptor in insulin producing cells regulates insulin secretion and controls glucose and lipid metabolism in Drosophila melanogaster. This study demonstrates a new adipokine signaling in Drosophila and provides insights for the mammalian adiponectin receptor function in pancreatic beta cells, which could be useful for therapeutic application.",2013,"Su-Jin Kwak, Seung-Hyun Hong, Rijan Bajracharya, Se-Yeol Yang, Kyu-Sun Lee, Kweon Yu, Su-Jin Kwak, Seung-Hyun Hong, Rijan Bajracharya, Se-Yeol Yang, Kyu-Sun Lee, Kweon Yu"
Selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons by MPP(+) and its rescue by D2 autoreceptors in Drosophila primary culture,23452092,10.1111/jnc.12228,"Drosophila melanogaster is widely used to study genetic factors causing Parkinson's disease (PD) largely because of the use of sophisticated genetic approaches and the presence of a high conservation of gene sequence/function between Drosophila and mammals. However, in Drosophila, little has been done to study the environmental factors which cause over 90% of PD cases. We used Drosophila primary neuronal culture to study degenerative effects of a well-known PD toxin MPP(+) . Dopaminergic (DA) neurons were selectively degenerated by MPP(+) , whereas cholinergic and GABAergic neurons were not affected. This DA neuronal loss was because of post-mitotic degeneration, not by inhibition of DA neuronal differentiation. We also found that MPP(+) -mediated neurodegeneration was rescued by D2 agonists quinpirole and bromocriptine. This rescue was through activation of Drosophila D2 receptor DD2R, as D2 agonists failed to rescue MPP(+) -toxicity in neuronal cultures prepared from both a DD2R deficiency line and a transgenic line pan-neuronally expressing DD2R RNAi. Furthermore, DD2R autoreceptors in DA neurons played a critical role in the rescue. When DD2R RNAi was expressed only in DA neurons, MPP(+) toxicity was not rescued by D2 agonists. Our study also showed that rescue of DA neurodegeneration by Drosophila DD2R activation was mediated through suppression of action potentials in DA neurons.",2013,"Lyle Wiemerslage, Bradley J Schultz, Archan Ganguly, Daewoo Lee, Lyle Wiemerslage, Bradley J Schultz, Archan Ganguly, Daewoo Lee"
"Anchor Away - A Fast, Reliable and Reversible Technique To Inhibit Proteins in Drosophila melanogaster",32217630,10.1534/g3.120.401055,"Several techniques have been developed to study specific gene function in loss-of-function situations. In Drosophila melanoga st er, RNAi and the generation of mutant clones are widely used. However, both techniques have the limitation that there is a significant time lag before gene function is abolished. Given the relatively rapid development of Drosophila, such perdurance is a serious impediment to study gene function. Here we describe the adaptation of the anchor-away technique for use in Drosophila Anchor-away was originally developed in yeast to quickly and efficiently abrogate the function of nuclear proteins by sequestering - anchoring - them away in a different cellular compartment. The required components are present in the cells, and the system is triggered by the addition of rapamycin, resulting in a rapid generation of a loss-of-function situation. We provide here proof of principle for the system by producing loss-of-function situations for two nuclear proteins - Pygopus and Brinker. The system allows to study the requirement of any protein during any time window, and at the same time circumvents difficulties, such as off-target effects or variable phenotypes, which are inherent in other techniques, for example RNAi.",2020,"Pablo Sanchez Bosch, Julia Pepperl, Konrad Basler, Pablo Sanchez Bosch, Julia Pepperl, Konrad Basler"
"Sexually dimorphic effects of dietary sugar on lifespan, feeding and starvation resistance in Drosophila",29207375,10.18632/aging.101335,"Lifespan and health in older age are strongly influenced by diet. Feeding Drosophila melanogaster diets high in sugar has increasingly been used as an experimental model to understand the physiological effects of unhealthy, contemporary human diets. Several metabolic parameters and physiological responses to nutrition are known to be dependent on the sex of the animal. However, sexual dimorphism in the responses to high-sugar diets in fruit flies has not been examined. Here we show that a high-sugar diet in Drosophila melanogaster elicits sexually dimorphic effects on feeding behaviour, starvation resistance and lifespan. Females feed less on such diets, while males feed more, and these feeding responses may have secondary consequences. Females, more than males, gain the ability to resist periods of starvation from high-sugar diets, indicating that the female response to excess sugar may be geared towards surviving food shortages in early life. At the same time, female lifespan is more susceptible to the detrimental effects of high sugar diets. Our study reveals differences between Drosophila sexes in their responses to sugar-rich diets, indicating the fruit fly could be used as a model to understand the sexually dimorphic features of human metabolic health.",2017,"Bhakti Chandegra, Jocelyn Lok Yee Tang, Haoyu Chi, Nazif Alic, Bhakti Chandegra, Jocelyn Lok Yee Tang, Haoyu Chi, Nazif Alic"

A cDNA encoding SSL was cloned into a vector designed to express it as a fusion protein with a hexahistidine tag, under the control of the Drosophila methallothionein promoter. The resulting construct was stably transfected into Drosophila S2 cells. After CdCl2 induction, transfected S2 cells secreted recombinant SSL into the cell culture medium. A cell line derived from stably transformed polyclonal cell populations expressing SSL was used for large-scale expression of SSL. Recombinant SSL was purified from the culture medium using a two-step purification scheme involving affinity binding to yeast cells and metal-affinity chromatography. Although yields of SSL were very low, correct folding and functionality of the recombinant SSL purified in this manner was demonstrated by its ability to bind to Aeromonas salmonicida.

However, the biochemical context of this regulatory system is still poorly characterized in Drosophila. Here, we present the first quantitative study that systematically characterizes the modularity and hormone sensitivity of the interaction proteome underlying growth control by the dInR/TOR pathway. Applying quantitative affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we identified 97 high confidence protein interactions among 58 network components. In all, 22% of the detected interactions were regulated by insulin affecting membrane proximal as well as intracellular signaling complexes. Systematic functional analysis linked a subset of network components to the control of dTORC1 and dTORC2 activity. Furthermore, our data suggest the presence of three distinct dTOR kinase complexes, including the evolutionary conserved dTTT complex (Drosophila TOR, TELO2, TTI1).

Recombination and the frequency spectrum in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,11230530,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003805,"Most ""tests of neutrality"" assess whether particular data sets depart from the predictions of a standard neutral model with no recombination. For Drosophila, where nuclear polymorphism data routinely show evidence of genetic exchange, the assumption of no recombination is often unrealistic. In addition, while conservative, this assumption is made at the cost of a great loss in power. Perhaps as a result, tests of the frequency spectrum based on zero recombination suggest an adequate fit of Drosophila polymorphism data to the predictions of the standard neutral model. Here, we analyze the frequency spectrum of a large number of loci in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans using two summary statistics. We use an estimate of the population recombination rate based on a laboratory estimate of the rate of crossing over per physical length and an estimate of the species' effective population size. In contrast to previous studies, we find that roughly half of the loci depart from the predictions of the standard neutral model. The extent of the departure depends on the exact recombination rate, but the global pattern that emerges is robust. Interestingly, these departures from neutral expectations are not unidirectional. The large variance in outcomes may be due to a complex demographic history and inconsistent sampling, or to the pervasive action of natural selection.",2001,"M Przeworski, J D Wall, P Andolfatto, M Przeworski, J D Wall, P Andolfatto"

During spermatogenesis each primary spermatocyte shows a centriole pair that moves to the cell membrane and organizes an axoneme-based structure, the cilium-like region (CLR). The CLRs persist through the meiotic divisions and are inherited by young spermatids. During spermatid differentiation the ciliary caps elongate giving rise to the sperm axoneme. Mutations in Klp10A, a kinesin-13 of Drosophila, results in defects of centriole/CLR organization in spermatocytes and of ciliary cap assembly in elongating spermatids. Reduced Klp10A expression also results in strong structural defects of sensory type I neurons. We show, here, that this protein displays a peculiar localization during male gametogenesis. The Klp10A signal is first detected at the distal ends of the centrioles when they dock to the plasma membrane of young primary spermatocytes. At the onset of the first meiotic prometaphase, when the CLRs reach their full size, Klp10A is enriched in a distinct narrow area at the distal end of the centrioles and persists in elongating spermatids at the base of the ciliary cap.

Furthermore, we identify YETI as a downstream target of the Drosophila DOM-A.

nAChR-induced octopamine release mediates the effect of nicotine on a startle response in Drosophila melanogaster,23331098,10.1111/jnc.12161,"Biogenic amines (BAs) play a central role in the generation of complex behaviors in vertebrates and invertebrates, including the fly Drosophila melanogaster. The comparative advantages of Drosophila as a genetic model to study the contribution of BAs to behaviors stumble upon the difficulty to access the fly brain to ask relevant physiological questions. For instance, it is not known whether the activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) induces the release of BAs in fly brain, a phenomenon associated to several behaviors in vertebrates. Here, we describe a new preparation to study the efflux of BAs in the adult fly brain by in vitro chronoamperometry. Using this preparation we show that nAChR agonists including nicotine induce a fast, transient, dose-dependent efflux of endogenous BAs, an effect mediated by α-bungarotoxin-sensitive nAChRs. By using different genetic tools we demonstrate that the BA whose efflux is induced by nAChR activation is octopamine (Oct). Furthermore, we show that the impairment of a mechanically induced startle response after nicotine exposure is not observed in flies deficient in Oct transmission. Thus, our data show that the efflux of BAs in Drosophila brain is increased by nAChR activation as in vertebrates, and that then AChR-induced Oct release could have implications in a nicotine-induced behavioral response.",2013,"Nicolás Fuenzalida-Uribe, Rodrigo C Meza, Hernán A Hoffmann, Rodrigo Varas, Jorge M Campusano, Nicolás Fuenzalida-Uribe, Rodrigo C Meza, Hernán A Hoffmann, Rodrigo Varas, Jorge M Campusano"
Functional analysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in Drosophila melanogaster,10331645,,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is conserved in eukaryotes. To analyze the function of PARP, we isolated and characterized the gene for PARP in Drosophila melanogaster. The PARP gene consisted of six translatable exons and spanned more than 50 kb.

Although the consensus cleavage site of CED-3 like protease during apoptosis is conserved from human to Xenopus laevis PARPs, it is neither conserved in the corresponding region of Drosophila nor Sarcophaga peregrina. There are two cDNAs species in Drosophila. One cDNA could encode the full length PARP protein (PARP I), while the other is a truncated cDNA which could encode a partial-length PARP protein (PARP II), which lacks the automodification domain and is possibly produced by alternative splicing. The expression of these two forms of PARP in E. coli demonstrated that while PARP II has the catalytic NAD-binding domain and DNA-binding domain it is enzymatically inactive. On the other hand PARP I is active. A deletion mutant of PARP gene could grow to the end of embryogenesis but did not grow to the adult fly.

Recent alternative promoter usage analyses in Drosophila melanogaster revealed that transposable elements significantly contribute to promote diversity. In this work, we analyzed in detail one of the transposable element insertions, named FBti0019985, that has been co-opted to drive expression of CG18446, a candidate stress response gene. We analyzed strains from different natural populations and we found that besides FBti0019985, there are another eight independent transposable elements inserted in the proximal promoter region of CG18446. All nine insertions are solo-LTRs that belong to the roo family. We analyzed the sequence of the nine roo insertions and we investigated whether the different insertions were functionally equivalent by performing 5'-RACE, gene expression, and cold-stress survival experiments. We found that different insertions have different molecular and functional consequences. The exact position where the transposable elements are inserted matters, as they all showed highly conserved sequences but only two of the analyzed insertions provided alternative transcription start sites, and only the FBti0019985 insertion consistently affects CG18446 expression. The phenotypic consequences of the different insertions also vary: only FBti0019985 was associated with cold-stress tolerance. Interestingly, the only previous report of transposable elements inserting repeatedly and independently in a promoter region in D. melanogaster, were also located upstream of a stress response gene. Our results suggest that functional validation of individual structural variants is needed to resolve the complexity of insertion clusters.",2016,"Miriam Merenciano, Anna Ullastres, M A R de Cara, Maite G Barrón, Josefa González, Miriam Merenciano, Anna Ullastres, M A R de Cara, Maite G Barrón, Josefa González"
Genotoxicity of cobalt nanoparticles and ions in Drosophila,22548285,10.3109/17435390.2012.689882,"Nanogenotoxicology is an emergent area of research, relevant for estimating the potential carcinogenic risk of nanomaterials. Since most of the approaches use in vitro studies, and neglecting the whole organism limits the accuracy of the obtained results, we have used Drosophila melanogaster to study the possible genotoxic potential of cobalt nanoparticles (Co NPs). The wing somatic mutation and recombination test has been the test of choice. This test is based on the principle that the loss of heterozygosis and the corresponding expression of the suitable recessive markers, multiple wing hairs and flare-3 can lead to the formation of mutant clone cells in growing up larvae, which are expressed as mutant spots on the wings of adult flies. Co NPs, as well as the ionic form cobalt chloride, were given to third instar larvae through the food, at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 mM. The results obtained indicate that both cobalt forms are able to induce significant increases in the frequency of mutant clones. Although at low concentrations only Co NPs were genotoxic, the level of genetic damage obtained at the highest dose tested of cobalt chloride (10 mM) showed a significant higher increase in the frequency of total spots than those observed after the treatment with cobalt nanoparticles. As conclusion, our results indicate that Co NPs were able to induce genotoxic activity in the wing-spot assay of D. melanogaster, mainly via the induction of somatic recombination. The differences observed in the behaviour of the two selected cobalt forms may result from differences in the uptake.",2013,"Gerard Vales, Eşref Demir, Bülent Kaya, Amadeu Creus, Ricard Marcos, Gerard Vales, Eşref Demir, Bülent Kaya, Amadeu Creus, Ricard Marcos"
Late replication domains in polytene and non-polytene cells of Drosophila melanogaster,22253867,10.1371/journal.pone.0030035,"In D. melanogaster polytene chromosomes, intercalary heterochromatin (IH) appears as large dense bands scattered in euchromatin and comprises clusters of repressed genes. IH displays distinctly low gene density, indicative of their particular regulation. Genes embedded in IH replicate late in the S phase and become underreplicated. We asked whether localization and organization of these late-replicating domains is conserved in a distinct cell type. Using published comprehensive genome-wide chromatin annotation datasets (modENCODE and others), we compared IH organization in salivary gland cells and in a Kc cell line. We first established the borders of 60 IH regions on a molecular map, these regions containing underreplicated material and encompassing ∼12% of Drosophila genome. We showed that in Kc cells repressed chromatin constituted 97% of the sequences that corresponded to IH bands. This chromatin is depleted for ORC-2 binding and largely replicates late. Differences in replication timing between the cell types analyzed are local and affect only sub-regions but never whole IH bands. As a rule such differentially replicating sub-regions display open chromatin organization, which apparently results from cell-type specific gene expression of underlying genes. We conclude that repressed chromatin organization of IH is generally conserved in polytene and non-polytene cells. Yet, IH domains do not function as transcription- and replication-regulatory units, because differences in transcription and replication between cell types are not domain-wide, rather they are restricted to small ""islands"" embedded in these domains. IH regions can thus be defined as a special class of domains with low gene density, which have narrow temporal expression patterns, and so displaying relatively conserved organization.",2012,"Elena S Belyaeva, Fedor P Goncharov, Olga V Demakova, Tatyana D Kolesnikova, Lidiya V Boldyreva, Valeriy F Semeshin, Igor F Zhimulev, Elena S Belyaeva, Fedor P Goncharov, Olga V Demakova, Tatyana D Kolesnikova, Lidiya V Boldyreva, Valeriy F Semeshin, Igor F Zhimulev"

The longest open reading frame of this cDNA had 690 codons and its deduced amino acid sequence had all five domains typical of a steroid hormone nuclear receptor. The deduced amino acid sequence of this cDNA showed the highest identity with the deduced amino acid sequence of E75A cDNAs cloned from M. sexta, G. melonella, and D. melanogaster, and is therefore named Choristoneura hormone receptor 75A (CHR75A). The CHR75A cDNA probe detected a 2.6 kb mRNA that was abundant at the time of the ecdysteroid peaks during molting in the embryonic, larval and pupal stages. In the sixth instar larvae, CHR75 mRNA was detected in the epidermis, fat body and midgut, and maximum expression was observed during the prepupal peak of ecdysteroids in the hemolymph. CHR75 mRNA was induced in ecdysone treated CF-203 cells and in the midgut, fat body and epidermis of larvae that were fed the non-steroidal ecdysteroid agonist, RH-5992. In vitro transcription and translation of the CHR75A cDNA yielded a 79 kDa protein that bound to the retinoic acid receptor related orphan receptor response element (RORE).",1997,"S R Palli, T R Ladd, A R Ricci, S S Sohi, A Retnakaran, S R Palli, T R Ladd, A R Ricci, S S Sohi, A Retnakaran"
Evolution of ribosomal RNA gene copy number on the sex chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster,1921706,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040664,"A diverse array of cellular and evolutionary forces--including unequal crossing-over, magnification, compensation, and natural selection--is at play modulating the number of copies of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes on the X and Y chromosomes of Drosophila. Accurate estimates of naturally occurring distributions of copy numbers on both the X and Y chromosomes are needed in order to explore the evolutionary end result of these forces. Estimates of relative copy numbers of the ribosomal DNA repeat, as well as of the type I and type II inserts, were obtained for a series of 96 X chromosomes and 144 Y chromosomes by using densitometric measurements of slot blots of genomic DNA from adult D. melanogaster bearing appropriate deficiencies that reveal chromosome-specific copy numbers. Estimates of copy number were put on an absolute scale with slot blots having serial dilutions both of the repeat and of genomic DNA from nonpolytene larval brain and imaginal discs. The distributions of rRNA copy number are decidedly skewed, with a long tail toward higher copy numbers. These distributions were fitted by a population genetic model that posits three different types of exchange events--sister-chromatid exchange, intrachromatid exchange, and interchromosomal crossing-over. In addition, the model incorporates natural selection, because experimental evidence shows that there is a minimum number of functional elements necessary for survival. Adequate fits of the model were found, indicating that either natural selection also eliminates chromosomes with high copy number or that the rate of intrachromatid exchange exceeds the rate of interchromosomal exchange.",1991,"E M Lyckegaard, A G Clark, E M Lyckegaard, A G Clark"

The evolution and development of eye size in flies,32400100,10.1002/wdev.380,"The compound eyes of flies exhibit striking variation in size, which has contributed to the adaptation of these animals to different habitats and their evolution of specialist behaviors. These differences in size are caused by differences in the number and/or size of ommatidia, which are specified during the development of the retinal field in the eye imaginal disc. While the genes and developmental mechanisms that regulate the formation of compound eyes are understood in great detail in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, we know very little about the genetic changes and mechanistic alterations that lead to natural variation in ommatidia number and/or size, and thus overall eye size, within and between fly species. Understanding the genetic and developmental bases for this natural variation in eye size not only has great potential to help us understand adaptations in fly vision but also determine how eye size and organ size more generally are regulated. Here we explore the genetic and developmental mechanisms that could underlie natural differences in compound eye size within and among fly species based on our knowledge of eye development in D. melanogaster and the few cases where the causative genes and mechanisms have already been identified. We suggest that the fly eye provides an evolutionary and developmental framework to better understand the regulation and diversification of this crucial sensory organ globally at a systems level as well as the gene regulatory networks and mechanisms acting at the tissue, cellular and molecular levels.

An Animal Model for Genetic Analysis of Multi-Gene Families: Cloning and Transgenesis of Large Tandemly Repeated Histone Gene Clusters,30073535,10.1007/978-1-4939-8663-7_17,"Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) are thought to participate in a range of essential molecular and cellular processes, including gene expression, replication, and nuclear organization. Importantly, histone PTMs are also thought to be prime candidates for carriers of epigenetic information across cell cycles and generations. However, directly testing the necessity of histone PTMs themselves in these processes by mutagenesis has been extremely difficult to carry out because of the highly repetitive nature of histone genes in animal genomes. We developed a transgenic system to generate Drosophila melanogaster genotypes in which the entire complement of replication-dependent histone genes is mutant at a residue of interest. We built a BAC vector containing a visible marker for lineage tracking along with the capacity to clone large (60-100 kb) inserts that subsequently can be site-specifically integrated into the D. melanogaster genome. We demonstrate that artificial tandem arrays of the core 5 kb replication-dependent histone repeat can be generated with relative ease. This genetic platform represents the first histone replacement system to leverage a single tandem transgenic insertion for facile genetics and analysis of molecular and cellular phenotypes. We demonstrate the utility of our system for directly preventing histone residues from being modified, and studying the consequent phenotypes.

Wolbachia Endosymbionts Modify Drosophila Ovary Protein Levels in a Context-Dependent Manner,27342560,10.1128/AEM.01255-16,"Endosymbiosis is a unique form of interaction between organisms, with one organism dwelling inside the other. One of the most widespread endosymbionts is Wolbachia pipientis, a maternally transmitted bacterium carried by insects, crustaceans, mites, and filarial nematodes. Although candidate proteins that contribute to maternal transmission have been identified, the molecular basis for maternal Wolbachia transmission remains largely unknown. To investigate transmission-related processes in response to Wolbachia infection, ovarian proteomes were analyzed from Wolbachia-infected Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. Endogenous and variant host-strain combinations were investigated. Significant and differentially abundant ovarian proteins were detected, indicating substantial regulatory changes in response to Wolbachia Variant Wolbachia strains were associated with a broader impact on the ovary proteome than endogenous Wolbachia strains. The D. melanogaster ovarian environment also exhibited a higher level of diversity of proteomic responses to Wolbachia than D. simulans. Overall, many Wolbachia-responsive ovarian proteins detected in this study were consistent with expectations from the experimental literature. This suggests that context-specific changes in protein abundance contribute to Wolbachia manipulation of transmission-related mechanisms in oogenesis.
    

    
  


        Importance:
      
    

    
      Millions of insect species naturally carry bacterial endosymbionts called Wolbachia. Wolbachia bacteria are transmitted by females to their offspring through a robust egg-loading mechanism. The molecular basis for Wolbachia transmission remains poorly understood at this time, however. This proteomic study identified specific fruit fly ovarian proteins as being upregulated or downregulated in response to Wolbachia infection. The majority of these protein responses correlated specifically with the type of host and Wolbachia strain involved. This work corroborates previously identified factors and mechanisms while also framing the broader context of ovarian manipulation by Wolbachia.",2016,"Steen Christensen, Ricardo Pérez Dulzaides, Victoria E Hedrick, A J M Zehadee Momtaz, Ernesto S Nakayasu, Lake N Paul, Laura R Serbus, Steen Christensen, Ricardo Pérez Dulzaides, Victoria E Hedrick, A J M Zehadee Momtaz, Ernesto S Nakayasu, Lake N Paul, Laura R Serbus"
Codon usage bias and effective population sizes on the X chromosome versus the autosomes in Drosophila melanogaster,23204387,10.1093/molbev/mss222,"Codon usage bias (CUB) in Drosophila is higher for X-linked genes than for autosomal genes. One possible explanation is that the higher effective recombination rate for genes on the X chromosome compared with the autosomes reduces their susceptibility to Hill-Robertson effects, and thus enhances the efficacy of selection on codon usage. The genome sequence of D. melanogaster was used to test this hypothesis. Contrary to expectation, it was found that, after correcting for the effective recombination rate, CUB remained higher on the X than on the autosomes. In contrast, an analysis of polymorphism data from a Rwandan population showed that mean nucleotide site diversity at 4-fold degenerate sites for genes on the X is approximately three-quarters of the autosomal value after correcting for the effective recombination rate, compared with approximate equality before correction. In addition, these data show that selection for preferred versus unpreferred synonymous variants is stronger on the X than the autosomes, which accounts for the higher CUB of genes on the X chromosome. This difference in the strength of selection does not appear to reflect the effects of dominance of mutations affecting codon usage, differences in gene expression levels between X and autosomes, or differences in mutational bias. Its cause therefore remains unexplained. The stronger selection on CUB on the X chromosome leads to a lower rate of synonymous site divergence compared with the autosomes; this will cause a stronger upward bias for X than A in estimates of the proportion of nonsynonymous mutations fixed by positive selection, for methods based on the McDonald-Kreitman test.",2013,"Jose L Campos, Kai Zeng, Darren J Parker, Brian Charlesworth, Penelope R Haddrill, Jose L Campos, Kai Zeng, Darren J Parker, Brian Charlesworth, Penelope R Haddrill"
Divergent abdominal bristle patterns in two distantly related drosophilids: antero-posterior variations and sexual dimorphism in a modular trait,18038182,10.1007/s10709-007-9227-5,"The number of neurosensory bristles on abdominal sternites of Drosophila is a most investigated trait for quantitative genetic studies. However, the developmental pattern expressed on successive segments in both sexes has remained so far a neglected field. We explored three aspects of this general problem with an isofemale line design: comparing two distantly related species, Drosophila melanogaster and Zaprionus indianus, investigating bristle number variation along the antero-posterior axis, and analysing the sexual dimorphism. Antero-posterior variations could be analysed from segment A2 to A7 in females, and A2-A5 in males. In D. melanogaster, males and females showed parallel changes with a consistently lower number in males. In Z. indianus females the number was quite stable along the abdomen, while in males an important antero-posterior increase was found. The sexual dimorphism was further analysed by considering the female-male correlation and the female/male ratio. The results suggest that sternite bristle number is determined by several developmental genetic systems. One is acting along the antero-posterior axis and may be associated to a gradient, since the genetic correlation decreases when more distant segments are compared. Another is acting in the same way on most segments of both sexes, since the female-male genetic correlation is similar between homologous and non-homologous segments. Finally, genes with specific sex effects are acting on A7 in females of both species, and on A5 in Z. indianus males. The overall architecture of female and male abdomen seems to be constrained by the development of reproductive organs. A large difference between species suggests, however, that the sexual dimorphism of abdominal bristle number is not evolutionarily constrained.",2008,"Luciana O Araripe, Amir Yassin, Louis Bernard Klaczko, Brigitte Moréteau, Jean R David, Luciana O Araripe, Amir Yassin, Louis Bernard Klaczko, Brigitte Moréteau, Jean R David"
Comparisons of eukaryotic genomic sequences,7809130,10.1073/pnas.91.26.12832,"A method for assessing genomic similarity based on relative abundances of short oligonucleotides in large DNA samples is introduced. The method requires neither homologous sequences nor prior sequence alignments. The analysis centers on (i) dinucleotide (and tri- and tetra-) relative abundance extremes in genomic sequences, (ii) distances between sequences based on all dinucleotide relative abundance values, and (iii) a multidimensional partial ordering protocol. The emphasis in this paper is on assessments of general relatedness of genomes as distinguished from phylogenetic reconstructions. Our methods demonstrate that the relative abundance distances almost always differ more for genomic interspecific sequence comparisons than for genomic intraspecific sequence comparisons, indicating congruence over different genome sequence samples. The genomic comparisons are generally concordant with accepted phylogenies among vertebrate and among fungal species sequences. Several unexpected relationships between the major groups of metazoa, fungal, and protist DNA emerge, including the following. (i) Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in dinucleotide relative abundance distances are as similar to each other as human is to bovine. (ii) S. cerevisiae, although substantially far from, is significantly closer to the vertebrates than are the invertebrates (Drosophila melanogaster, Bombyx mori, and Caenorhabditis elegans). This phenomenon may suggest variable evolutionary rates during the metazoan radiations and slower changes in the fungal divergences, and/or a polyphyletic origin of metazoa. (iii) The genomic sequences of D. melanogaster and Trypanosoma brucei are strikingly similar. This DNA similarity might be explained by some molecular adaptation of the parasite to its dipteran (tsetse fly) host, a host-parasite gene transfer hypothesis. Robustness of the methods may be due to a genomic signature of dinucleotide relative abundance values reflecting DNA structures related to dinucleotide stacking energies, constraints of DNA curvature, and mechanisms attendant to replication, repair, and recombination.",1994,"S Karlin, I Ladunga, S Karlin, I Ladunga"
Saccharomyces cerevisiae synthesizes proteins related to the p21 gene product of ras genes found in mammals,6422257,10.1128/mcb.4.1.23,"A family of normal vertebrate genes and oncogenes has been called the ras gene family.

Prior experiments have detected proteins coded for by ras genes in a large number of normal cells, cell lines, and tumors. We report here the detection of ras-related proteins in D. melanogaster, a result predicted by the earlier detection of ras-related genes in the Drosophila genome. We also report for the first time the detection of ras-related proteins in a single-cell eucaryocyte, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins, approximately 30K in size, are recognized by both a monoclonal antibody which binds to the p21 coded for by mammalian ras genes and a polyclonal rat serum made by transplanting a v-Ha-ras-induced tumor in Osborne-Mendel rats. The p21 of v-Ha-ras and the 30K proteins from S. cerevisiae share methionine-labeled peptides as detected by two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps.

Here, we investigate this potential link by examining changes in behavior and longevity in fruit flies with altered pheromone profiles. We demonstrate that oenocyte-specific reduction of desaturase activity is sufficient to dramatically alter the composition of the hydrocarbon mix displayed by the flies. In addition, flies with altered desaturase activity display changes in fecundity and stereotypical mating behavior, and, importantly, extended longevity.

Proteome mapping of the Drosophila melanogaster male reproductive system,19343724,10.1002/pmic.200800795,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model organism for studying insect reproductive biology. Although the gene expression profiles of both male and female reproductive organs have been studied in detail, their proteomic profiles and functional characteristics largely remained to be clarified. In this study, we conducted proteome mapping of the male internal reproductive organs using 2-DE. We identified a total of 440 protein components from gels of the male reproductive organs (testis, seminal vesicle, accessory gland, ejaculatory duct, and ejaculatory bulb). A number of proteins associated with odorant/pheromone-binding, lipid metabolism, proteolysis, and antioxidation were expressed tissue specifically in the male reproductive system. Based on our proteomic data set, we constructed reference proteome maps of the reproductive organs, which will provide valuable information toward a comprehensive understanding of Drosophila reproduction.",2009,"Nobuaki Takemori, Masa-Toshi Yamamoto, Nobuaki Takemori, Masa-Toshi Yamamoto"
[Three-dimensional organization of telomeres in the Drosophila melanogaster salivary glands nuclei],18771173,,"The 3D-FISH was employed to investigate the telomere topology in polytene nuclei of salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster. The majorities of telomeres in polytene nuclei of salivary glands in Drosophila strain y(2-717) are localized in the nuclear central area and have no contacts with nuclear membrane. In females of this strain, ectopic contacts between telomeres occur at 25 % higher frequency than in males. HeT-A DNA in y(2-717alk3-2) strain, which is a derivative of y(2-717) carrying an inversion between 1D and 13C bands, is found in region 13 of X chromosome. The frequency of ectopic contacts of telomeres in y(2-717alk3-2) males is 10 % higher than that in y(2-717) strain. The number of ectopic contacts can be significantly different in independent experiments, possibly indicating the role of random factors in the contact formation.",2008,"L P Zakharenko, M P Perepelkina, S Mai, L P Zakharenko, M P Perepelkina, S Mai"
Influence of developmental environment on male- and female-mediated sperm precedence in Drosophila melanogaster,17210031,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2006.01184.x,"Length of the sperm flagellum and of the female's primary sperm-storage organ, the seminal receptacle (SR), exhibit a pattern of rapid correlated evolution in Drosophila and other lineages. Experimental evolution studies with Drosophila melanogaster indicate that these traits have coevolved through sexual selection, with length of the SR representing the proximal basis of female sire discrimination, biasing paternity according to sperm length. Here, we examine the impact of experimentally varying the developmental environment, including larval density and larval and adult nutrition, on sperm length, SR length and on the pattern of sperm precedence. Expression of SR length was far more sensitive to variation among developmental environments than was sperm length. Nevertheless, there was striking co-variation in sperm and SR length. The developmental environment of both females and second males, but not first males, significantly contributed to variation in male competitive fertilization success.",2007,"E G Amitin, S Pitnick, E G Amitin, S Pitnick"
Neural circuits underlying circadian behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,16414209,10.1016/j.beproc.2005.12.008,"Circadian clocks include control systems for organizing daily behavior. Such a system consists of a time-keeping mechanism (the clock or pacemaker), input pathways for entraining the clock, and output pathways for producing overt rhythms in behavior and physiology. In Drosophila melanogaster, as in mammals, neural circuits play vital roles in all three functional subdivisions of the circadian system. Regarding the pacemaker, multiple clock neurons, each with cell-autonomous pacemaker capability, are coupled to each other in a network. The outputs of different sets of clock neurons in this network combine to produce the normal bimodal pattern of locomotor activity observed in Drosophila. Regarding input, multiple sensory modalities (including light, temperature, and pheromones) use their own circuitry to entrain the clock. Regarding output, distinct circuits are likely involved for controlling the timing of eclosion and for generating the locomotor activity rhythms. This review summarizes work on all of these circadian circuits, and discusses the broader utility of studying the fly's circadian system.",2006,"Dennis C Chang, Dennis C Chang"
Asymmetric exchange is associated with P element induced male recombination in Drosophila melanogaster,12136413,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800108,"Spontaneous meiotic recombination events do not normally occur in the male germ line of Drosophila melanogaster. However, such events are induced in males when a P transposable element or a source of P element encoded transposase protein is present in its genome. This report concerns a molecular analysis of the meiotic exchanges that were induced in the male Drosophila by P elements within a genetically marked region of the third chromosome. The marked region also harbors a single P-element called P(lArB). Fifty-six percent of the P(lArB) region crossovers indicated some alterations in the P element 5' fragment. Such alterations appear to be related to asymmetric or unequal genetic exchanges. Finally, P(lArB) excision was found to be independent of P(lArB) region crossover events.",2002,"A Duttaroy, A Duttaroy"

Irradiated Y;2 translocations served as source material. The insertion selection scheme was based on the emergence of additional progeny classes in the case of independent segregation of the detached fragments of the Y chromosome and autosome. A total of seven insertions of Y-chromosome material into the left arm of chromosome 2, specifically in regions 29F, 34A, and 36B, were obtained. All insertions were lethal in the homozygous state and caused crossing-over suppression in the left arm of chromosome 2. In addition, these mutations induced the formation of loops between the chromocenter and the region of insertion, as well as breaks in one or both homologs, which are frequently observed in preparations of polytene chromosomes. The selection scheme suggested can be used to produce insertions in any region of Drosophila melanogaster chromosomes 2 and 3, for which the Y;2 translocations exist.",2000,"G N Anan'ina, B F Chadov, G N Anan'ina, B F Chadov"

The experiment showed that the resistance of the flies to the studied stresses decreased with age, except in the case of females submitted to starvation which was increased. These variations were explained by the amount of lipid. Variation in desiccation resistance was not explained by the amount of water. As a function of gravity, no or slight differences were observed for the studied stresses. The resistance to heat of young flies increased with the gravity level.

Finally, DFP labelling demonstrated that the specific proteolytic cleavage leading to the formation of 55 and 16 kDa subunits occurred in Sf9 cells. In contrast with the full-length enzyme, C-terminal-truncated forms were highly secreted, confirming the prominent role of the C-terminal hydrophobic peptide for the addition of the glycolipidic residue.

Retroviruses in invertebrates: the gypsy retrotransposon is apparently an infectious retrovirus of Drosophila melanogaster,8108403,10.1073/pnas.91.4.1285,"Retroviruses are commonly considered to be restricted to vertebrates. However, the genome of many eukaryotes contains mobile sequences known as retrotransposons with long terminal repeats (LTR retrotransposons) or viral retrotransposons, showing similarities with integrated proviruses of retroviruses, such as Ty elements in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, copia-like elements in Drosophila, and endogenous proviruses in vertebrates. The gypsy element of Drosophila melanogaster has LTRs and contains three open reading frames, one of which encodes potential products similar to gag-specific protease, reverse transcriptase, and endonuclease. It is more similar to typical retroviruses than to LTR retrotransposons. We report here experiments showing that gypsy can be transmitted by microinjecting egg plasma from embryos of a strain containing actively transposing gypsy elements into embryos of a strain originally devoid of transposing elements. Horizontal transfer is also observed when individuals of the ""empty"" stock are raised on medium containing ground pupae of the stock possessing transposing elements. These results suggest that gypsy is an infectious retrovirus and provide evidence that retroviruses also occur in invertebrates.",1994,"A Kim, C Terzian, P Santamaria, A Pélisson, N Purd'homme, A Bucheton, A Kim, C Terzian, P Santamaria, A Pélisson, N Purd'homme, A Bucheton"
Regulatory signals and signal molecules in early neurogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster,28305606,10.1007/BF00188770,"The ectodermal germ layer of Drosophila melanogaster gives rise to two major cell lineages, the neural and the epidermal. Progenitor cells for each of these lineages arise from groups of cells, whose elements must decide between taking on either fate. Commitment of the progenitor cells to one of the developmental fates implies two factors. One is intrinsic to the ectodermal cells and determines a propensity to take on neural fate; this factor is probably represented by the products of the so-called proneural genes, which are differentially distributed throughout the ectoderm. The other factor in the cells' decision to adopt one of the two alternative fates is intercellular communication, which is mediated by the products of the so-called neurogenic genes. Two types of interactions, one inhibiting and the other stimulating neural development, have been inferred. We discuss here the assumed role of various neurogenic genes, in particular Notch and Delta, in these processes.",1992,"José A Campos-Ortega, Marc Haenlin, José A Campos-Ortega, Marc Haenlin"

"Induced dominant lethal mutations and cytotoxic effects in germ cells of Drosophila melanogaster with Trenimon, PDMT and sodium monofluorophosphate",410699,,"Male and female Drosophila melanogaster with special sex chromosome or special autosome constitutions were fed with the mutagenic chemicals Trenimon (2,3,5-trisethyleneimino-1,4-benzoquinone) and PDMT (1-phenyl-3, 3-dimethyltriazene) and with the toxic substance Na2PO3F (sodium monofluorophosphate). The frequency of dominant lethality was recorded among the progeny. The results clearly show that dominant lethality is dose dependent for Trenimon- or PDMT-treated chromosomes in mature sperm and mature oocytes, and an increased amount of chromosomal material per nucleus yields an enhanced lethality. In contrast, a pure toxic effect of Na2PO3F on mature oocytes was demonstrated with one type of female. --With the stocks of Drosophila used, it is possible to distinguish between mutagenic and toxic effects of chemicals on the germ cells.

Gametic incompatibilities between races of Drosophila melanogaster,11345322,10.1098/rspb.2000.1420,"Reproductive-isolating mechanisms between nascent species may involve sperm-egg recognition and have been best described in externally fertilizing organisms where such recognition is essential in preventing undesirable fertilizations. However, reproductive barriers in internally fertilizing species differ in significant ways, and a direct role for sperm-egg interactions has yet to be demonstrated. Females of many strains of Drosophila melanogaster from Zimbabwe, Africa, do not mate readily with cosmopolitan males. This polymorphism in mate choice is postulated to represent incipient speciation. We now report that, in one direction, crosses between the above populations produce far fewer offspring than reciprocal crosses due to a lower rate of egg hatch. We established that egg inviability in these crosses was due to defects in fertilization. Thus, even in taxa with internal fertilization, gametic incompatibility may be a mechanism relevant to reproductive isolation during incipient speciation.",2001,"J A Alipaz, C I Wu, T L Karr, J A Alipaz, C I Wu, T L Karr"

We test the hypothesis that resistance to environmental stresses is lost under laboratory adaptation. For both traits, there was a rapid loss of resistance over a three-year period. The rapidity of the response suggested that mutation accumulation could not account for it. Rather, resistance to environmental stresses appeared to be lost as a correlated response to selection on another trait, such as early fertility, with which stress resistance is negatively genetically correlated. These results suggest that caution is needed when extrapolating from evolution of stress resistance in long-established laboratory stocks to patterns of responses and correlated responses in natural populations.",2001,"A A Hoffmann, R Hallas, C Sinclair, L Partridge, A A Hoffmann, R Hallas, C Sinclair, L Partridge"
Chromosomal effects of rapid gene evolution in Drosophila melanogaster,11141564,10.1126/science.291.5501.128,"Rapid adaptive fixation of a new favorable mutation is expected to affect neighboring genes along the chromosome. Evolutionary theory predicts that the chromosomal region would show a reduced level of genetic variation and an excess of rare alleles. We have confirmed these predictions in a region of the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster that contains a newly evolved gene for a component of the sperm axoneme. In D. simulans, where the novel gene does not exist, the pattern of genetic variation is consistent with selection against recurrent deleterious mutations. These findings imply that the pattern of genetic variation along a chromosome may be useful for inferring its evolutionary history and for revealing regions in which recent adaptive fixations have taken place.",2001,"D Nurminsky, D D Aguiar, C D Bustamante, D L Hartl, D Nurminsky, D D Aguiar, C D Bustamante, D L Hartl"

These results show that SSa females, although lacking aristae, could distinguish between the two types of males in that they mated more readily with males that sang.

Suppressed recombination lines did not shift selection response to the freely recombining X chromosomes, despite fairly large increased in X chromosome recombination. The results suggest that in populations of moderate size, sex does not accelerate short term response to selection.",1977,"V Thompson, V Thompson"
Age-dependent arginine phosphokinase activity changes in male vestigial and wild-type Drosophila melanogaster,171197,10.1159/000212045,"The activity of arginine phosphokinase, an important muscle enzyme in insects, was investigated with age in vestigial-winged and wild-type Drosophila melanogaster. Identical patterns of age-dependent activity changes were observed in the vestigial-winged flies as in the wild-type, even though vestigial-winged flies exhibit a 50% mortality approximately two thirds that of the wild-type as well as being incapable of flight.

Courtship song rhythms in Drosophila yakuba,10049478,10.1006/anbe.1998.0976,"We studied the courtship songs of males from several strains of Drosophila yakuba. There was clear evidence for two types of pulse songs, generated by the male's wing vibration, which we called 'thud' song and 'clack' song. Clack song was generated by both wings, at distances further from the female than the thud component, which was produced by one-wing displays. The carrier frequency of clack song was considerably higher than that of thud, whereas the interpulse intervals (IPI) of thud song, which usually predominated, were shorter. Furthermore, thud song revealed a cycling of IPIs with a period of about 70 s, significantly longer than that of D. melanogaster or D. simulans.

Replication rates of microbes within arthropod hosts, for example, are correlated with incubation temperature but less is known about the influence of host-symbiont dynamics on environmental preference. Hence, we conducted thermal preference (Tp ) assays and tested if infection status and genetic variation in endosymbiont bacterium Wolbachia affected temperature choice of Drosophila melanogaster. We demonstrate that isogenic flies infected with Wolbachia preferred lower temperatures compared with uninfected Drosophila. Moreover, Tp varied with respect to three investigated Wolbachia variants (wMel, wMelCS, and wMelPop). While uninfected individuals preferred 24.4°C, we found significant shifts of -1.2°C in wMel- and -4°C in flies infected either with wMelCS or wMelPop.

Here, we report Snp requirement for normal Drosophila development, since its perturbation leads to larval arrest and tissue-specific downregulation results in abnormal tissue development. Additionally, Snp directly interacts with histone mRNA, and its depletion results in drastic reduction in histone transcript levels. We propose that Snp protects the 3'-ends of histone mRNAs and upon its absence, histone transcripts are readily degraded.

Among 380 GS strains screened using an assay plate-containing soybean and corn tastants, we identified one mutant, GS1189 that did not show any preference for either of the foods. Further behavioral assays indicated that the GS1189 larvae could have impaired olfactory and gustatory systems.

Our data reveal previously unreported epochs in the reproductive life of females: optimal, vulnerable and declining-terminal. During the optimal period, mating induces females to respond with a surge in egg laying and has a reversible effect on mortality rate. In contrast, during the vulnerable period, mating does not induce females to respond with a surge in egg laying and causes an irreversible increase in mortality rate. The terminal period was always observed several days before death, irrespective of the chronological age, and is marked by sharp reductions in egg laying. The presence of these distinctive biological epochs may reflect increased female sensitivity to mating due to age-related decline.",2007,"Blanka Rogina, Tom Wolverton, Tyson G Bross, Kun Chen, Hans-Georg Müller, James R Carey, Blanka Rogina, Tom Wolverton, Tyson G Bross, Kun Chen, Hans-Georg Müller, James R Carey"

We examined whether the cost of mating exists in mutant females that are unable to produce eggs. Three different mutant alleles of ovarian tumors (otu) and an allele of dunce (dnc(M11)) of Drosophila melanogaster were used to sterilize females. For all the female sterile mutants tested, mating dramatically decreased the life span of homozygous sterile females. Even more extreme shortening of life spans were observed when the sex peptide gene (Acp70A) was expressed in homozygous otu females, though they were virgin, indicating that the shortening in life span is due to seminal factors.

The fate of the dicentric chromosome was evaluated in the mitotic cells of the male germline. We found that dicentric chromosomes break in mitosis, and the broken fragments can be transmitted. Some of these chromosome fragments exhibit dominant semilethality. Nonlethal fragments were broken at many sites along the chromosome, but the semilethal fragments were all broken near the original site of sister-chromatid fusion, and retained P element sequences near their termini.

Analysis of fertility, longevity, viability and resistance to starvation showed that selection for late oviposition resulted in delayed senescence of flies of the experimental populations. Genetic structure of population vg changed considerably with regard to the Adh locus. This was confirmed by parameters of activity, thermostability and electrophoretic mobility of the enzyme isolated from flies after 30 generations of selection. Analysis of frequencies of the Adh alleles showed that in both selected populations, which initially had different genetic composition, accumulated allele AdhS, which encodes the isozyme that is less active but more resistant to inactivation.

Notwithstanding the rapid elimination of the mutation from the population, positive selection for viability was shown, which increased fitness of the mutation carriers in generations. The fitness component viability was estimated in individuals l(2)M167(DTS)/+; relative to that of wild-type individuals, it varied from 0.1 to 1.

Temperature affects the ontogeny of sexually dimorphic cuticular hydrocarbons in Drosophila melanogaster,12235202,,"Hydrocarbons on the cuticle of mature Drosophila melanogaster flies play a crucial role in mate recognition, and protect against dehydration. We measured the effect of temperature on mature cuticular hydrocarbons (CHs) by (i) rearing two control strains at different temperatures, (ii) shifting the temperature after metamorphosis and (iii) inducing a single heat-shock pulse in control and heat-sensitive transgenic strains, over a period of 3 days following adult eclosion. This study describes the time course of the events involved in the production of male- and female-predominant CHs. We also found that 'immature' CHs, sexually monomorphic CHs on younger flies, were not affected by these treatments.",2002,"Fabrice Savarit, Jean-François Ferveur, Fabrice Savarit, Jean-François Ferveur"
The histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A influences the development of Drosophila melanogaster,11706997,10.1007/PL00000809,"We examined the consequences of the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) on the development of Drosophila melanogaster. When fed to flies, TSA caused lethality and delayed development at concentrations as low as 5 microM, had stronger effects on males than females, and acted synergistically with mutations in the gene encoding the RPD3 deacetylase to cause notched wings, but did not appear to affect a SINA signaling pathway that is normally repressed by the SIN3 corepressor. These findings suggest that deacetylated histones play an important role in normal developmental progression and establish parameters for genetic screens to dissect the role of deacetylases in this process.",2001,"L A Pile, F W Lee, D A Wassarman, L A Pile, F W Lee, D A Wassarman"

A directed mutagenesis screen in Drosophila melanogaster reveals new mutants that influence hedgehog signaling,11102373,,"The Hedgehog signaling pathway has been recognized as essential for patterning processes in development of metazoan animal species. The signaling pathway is, however, not entirely understood. To start to address this problem, we set out to isolate new mutations that influence Hedgehog signaling. We performed a mutagenesis screen for mutations that dominantly suppress Hedgehog overexpression phenotypes in the Drosophila melanogaster wing. We isolated four mutations that influence Hedgehog signaling. These were analyzed in the amenable wing system using genetic and molecular techniques. One of these four mutations affects the stability of the Hedgehog expression domain boundary, also known as the organizer in the developing wing. Another mutation affects a possible Hedgehog autoregulation mechanism, which stabilizes the same boundary.",2000,"N Haines, M van den Heuvel, N Haines, M van den Heuvel"
Mutations in the alpha-tubulin 67C gene specifically impair achiasmate segregation in Drosophila melanogaster,10601329,10.1083/jcb.147.6.1137,"Drosophila melanogaster oocytes heterozygous for mutations in the alpha-tubulin 67C gene (alphatub67C) display defects in centromere positioning during prometaphase of meiosis I. The centromeres do not migrate to the poleward edges of the chromatin mass, and the chromatin fails to stretch during spindle lengthening. These results suggest that the poleward forces acting at the kinetochore are compromised in the alphatub67C mutants. Genetic studies demonstrate that these mutations also strongly and specifically decrease the fidelity of achiasmate chromosome segregation. Proper centromere orientation, chromatin elongation, and faithful segregation can all be restored by a decrease in the amount of the Nod chromokinesin. These results suggest that the accurate segregation of achiasmate chromosomes requires the proper balancing of forces acting on the chromosomes during prometaphase.",1999,"H J Matthies, L G Messina, R Namba, K J Greer, M Y Walker, R S Hawley, H J Matthies, L G Messina, R Namba, K J Greer, M Y Walker, R S Hawley"

A mutation in yolk protein 3, YP3S1, has been described in which the leader sequence is not cleaved from the protein. We describe here ultrastructural and molecular studies on the YP3S1 mutant and show that the mutant protein enters the secretory pathway and forms precipitates, often as electron dense material in excessive elaborations of the plasma membrane. Females homozygous for YP3S1 lay fewer eggs than wild type flies and these embryos are less viable.

We tested this hypothesis directly by measuring age-specific variability in gene expression. Analysis of the transcriptional activity of six genes in various inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster unexpectedly failed to show an increase in variability among individuals as they age and die.

Cost of mating in Drosophila melanogaster females is mediated by male accessory gland products,7816137,10.1038/373241a0,"Female Drosophila melanogaster with environmentally or genetically elevated rates of mating die younger than controls. This cost of mating is not attributable to receipt of sperm. We demonstrate here that seminal fluid products from the main cells of the male accessory gland are responsible for the cost of mating in females, and that increasing exposure to these products increases female death rate. Main-cell products are also involved in elevating the rate of female egg-laying, in reducing female receptivity to further matings and in removing or destroying sperm of previous mates. The cost of mating to females may therefore represent a side-effect of evolutionary conflict between males.",1995,"T Chapman, L F Liddle, J M Kalb, M F Wolfner, L Partridge, T Chapman, L F Liddle, J M Kalb, M F Wolfner, L Partridge"

In situ analyses of the RNA suggest that high levels of the transcript are synthesised in the ovaries and deposited uniformly in the egg.

The model demonstrates that, if heterozygosity for an inversion effectively reduces element associated production of detrimental chromosome rearrangements, a differential accumulation of elements is expected, with increased copy number inside the minority inversion. Several-fold differential accumulations are possible with certain parameter values. We present data on P element counts for inversion polymorphisms on all five chromosome arms of 157 haploid genomes from two African populations.

Dissection of recipient flies and genetic analysis of their progeny demonstrated that the donor ovary in fertile flies was capable of normal functioning in the case of connection of the donor ovary in fertile flies with the recipient oviducts. Therefore, female-sterile mutations at the ecs locus are somatic line specific. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis revealed normal level of the yolk proteins in such females.

The results show a strong sexual selection against mutant males when flies have been raised under low larval competition. Under high larval competition, there is a reduction in mating disadvantage of mutant males. In both instances, a frequency-dependent sexual selection exists.

We show here using germline transformation that active P factor alone cannot mimic the effect of this cross, suggesting that MRh12/Cy contains some other activator. In addition, we have observed that ct+ exceptional progeny arise in the F1 as well as the F2 generations. Molecular analysis of X chromosomes from some ct+ progeny indicates that phenotypic reversion of the ct mutation can arise through two unrelated mechanisms.",1989,"A J Brown, S J Ross, L S Alphey, A J Flavell, T I Gerasimova, A J Brown, S J Ross, L S Alphey, A J Flavell, T I Gerasimova"

Immunofluorescence microscopy showed the presence of hsp 23 preferentially in nuclei after heat shock, while on return to 25 degrees C, hsp 23 was reduced in nuclei and increased in the cytoplasm. Thus the immunofluorescence observations reported here unambiguously confirm for hsp 23 earlier reports that heat shock proteins are mainly found in nuclei after heat shock and that upon return to 25 degrees C, they move to the cytoplasm.",1981,"A P Arrigo, C Ahmad-Zadeh, A P Arrigo, C Ahmad-Zadeh"
Restriction analysis of spacers in ribosomal DNA of Drosophila melanogaster,114986,10.1093/nar/7.1.205,"The sequence arrangement of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) spacers in Drosophila melanogaster was analyzed with restriction endonucleases. Spacers, derived from cloned rDNA repeats and from uncloned purified rDNA, are internally repetitive, as demonstrated by the regular 250 base pairs interval between sites recognized by the enzyme Alu I. Length heterogeneity of spacers is due at least in part to varying numbers of repeated sequence elements. All spacers and analyzed, whether derived from X or from Y chromosomal rDNA, have a very similar sequence organization. The distance separating the repeated nontranscribed spacer sequences from the 5' end of the transcribed region is conserved in all ten cloned fragments examined, and is probably less than 150 base pairs, as measured by electron microscopy.",1979,"E O Long, I B Dawid, E O Long, I B Dawid"

Females showing various degrees of sterility arise when reactive strain females are crossed to inducer males. The degree of sterility depends on the particular reactive and inducer strains used in the cross. Quantitative variations in the efficiency of inducer and reactive strains to produce sterile F1 females are studied in the present paper. The results indicate that the order which can be established within a set of reactive strains for this efficiency is largely independent of the inducer strain which is chosen for the cross.",1976,"A Bucheton, J M Lavige, G Picard, P L'Heritier, A Bucheton, J M Lavige, G Picard, P L'Heritier"

"Time, love and species",11524627,,"Physiological and behavioral phenomena of many animals are restricted to certain times of the day. Many organisms show daily rhythms in their mating. The daily fluctuation in mating activity of a few insects is controlled by an endogenous clock. The fruitfly, Drosophila, is the most suitable material to characterize the genetic basis of circadian rhythms of mating because some mutants with defective core oscillator mechanism, feedback loops, have been isolated. D. melanogaster wild-type display a robust circadian rhythm in the mating activity, and the rhythms are abolished in period or timeless null mutant flies (per(01) and tim(01)), the rhythms are generated by females but not males. Disconnected (disco) mutants which have a severe defect in the optic lobe and are missing lateral neurons show arrhythmicity in mating activities. Thus, the lateral neurons seem to be essential for the circadian rhythm in mating activity of Drosophila. Furthermore, an anti-phasic relation in circadian rhythms of the mating activity was detected between D. melanogaster and their sibling species D. simulans. The Queensland fruit flies or wild gypsy moth also show species-specific mating rhythm, suggesting that species-specific circadian rhythms in mating activity of insect appear to cause a reproductive isolation.",2001,"T Sakai, N Ishida, T Sakai, N Ishida"
bicoid mRNA localization signal: phylogenetic conservation of function and RNA secondary structure,2081457,,"Transcripts of the bicoid (bcd) gene are localized to the anterior pole of the Drosophila oocyte, thereby allowing formation in the embryo of an anteroposterior gradient of the bcd protein morphogen. We previously showed that a 630 nucleotide portion of the 3' noncoding region of the bcd mRNA is necessary for this localization, and is sufficient to confer anterior localization on a heterologous transcript. Here I have used a comparative analysis to begin to more precisely define the cis-acting mRNA localization signal. The bcd genes from six additional Drosophila species were cloned, and DNA of the 3' noncoding regions sequenced. Three of these regions were tested interspecifically for mRNA localization in D. melanogaster and each functioned correctly; these regions must therefore contain the cis-acting signal. The primary sequences, which are up to 50% divergent from the D. melanogaster gene, show patchy homology throughout most of the region. Interestingly, all seven species can potentially form a large stereotypic secondary structure. This structure is a likely candidate for the localization signal and can be used for the rational design of mutations to test that possibility.",1990,"P M MacDonald, P M MacDonald"

In the wpch parts of the eye, small and giant unpigmented ""pigment granules"" reside in secondary pigment cells. These white granules are just like the corresponding granules of w mutant D. melanogaster.

Motivational states are determined by physiological parameters whose homeostatic imbalances are signaled to and processed within the brain, often mediated by modulatory peptides. Here, we investigate the regulation of appetitive and feeding behavior in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We report that four neurons in the fly brain that release SIFamide are integral elements of a complex neuropeptide network that regulates feeding. We show that SIFamidergic cells integrate feeding stimulating (orexigenic) and feeding suppressant (anorexigenic) signals to appropriately sensitize sensory circuits, promote appetitive behavior, and enhance food intake.

The aim of this study was to identify the AC that participates in sugar perception. Here, we found that an AC inhibitor, MDL-12330A, depressed the response in GRNs to trehalose as well as sucrose; that an AC gene, AC78C, was expressed in the sugar-sensitive GRNs; that RNAi against AC78C depressed the electrical response in GRNs to sucrose; and that the sugar response in GRNs, as well as sugar intake in a behavioral assay in an AC78C mutant, was depressed at low sugar concentrations.

We did not detect a nonredundant function for Acp62F in modulating the egg laying, fertility, remating frequency, or life span of mated females. However, loss of Acp62F did alter a male's defensive sperm competitive ability, consistent with the localization of Acp62F to sperm storage organs. In addition, the processing of at least one seminal protein, the ovulation hormone ovulin, is slower in the absence of Acp62F.",2008,"Jacob L Mueller, Jon R Linklater, Kristipati Ravi Ram, Tracey Chapman, Mariana F Wolfner, Jacob L Mueller, Jon R Linklater, Kristipati Ravi Ram, Tracey Chapman, Mariana F Wolfner"
The circadian clock in old Drosophila melanogaster,11707931,10.1023/a:1010091829946,"A growing body of evidence indicates that one of the age-associated changes in the central nervous system that affect most old people is the loss of function of the circadian clock system. This loss results in impaired timing and quality of sleep, with consequent cognitive and other behavior problems. Failure of the clock contributes to the difficulties encountered with Alzheimer's disease. It also results in adverse changes in the hormonal regulation of intermediary metabolism, stress resistance and sexual function. Drosophila melanogaster is proposed as a model organism where this age-related change may be studied more readily. Circadian patterns are disrupted in Drosophila, with considerable differences between strains. In addition a fusion gene product of a key gene involved in the clock (per), and Green Fluorescent Protein, shows a 50% fall with age.",2000,"C Driver, C Driver"
Genetics of alpha-amanitin resistance in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster,11012721,10.1046/j.1365-2540.2000.00729.x,"The genetic basis of variation in resistance to natural toxins is of interest for both ecological and evolutionary genetics. The wide variety of larval resources used by Drosophila, both within and between species, makes flies an excellent system for studying causes and consequences of selection resulting from exposure to natural toxins associated with different resources. In this study we carry out a genetic analysis of alpha-amanitin resistance in a population sample of Drosophila melanogaster. Data from mapping crosses of chromosome III support a role for a naturally occurring polymorphism in a multidrug resistance gene (Mdr65A) in alpha-amanitin resistance. However, there are no amino acid differences between resistant and sensitive chromosomes at Mdr65A. Therefore, if Mdr65A mutants contribute to the difference between alpha-amanitin-resistant and alpha-amanitin-sensitive third chromosome lines, the underlying cause is a gene regulatory mutation.",2000,"D J Begun, P Whitley, D J Begun, P Whitley"

Larger flies laid more eggs early in life and lived shorter lives than smaller flies, which not only lived longer but also laid more eggs later in life. This supports the notion of a mortality cost of reproduction in Drosophila. The total number of eggs laid per lifetime did not differ between the two groups. The percentage of offspring hatched started at normal levels (about 50% of eggs laid), then declined rapidly in large flies. In small flies, hatchability started at a lower level early in life (40-65%), but declined less rapidly, and later in life was higher than the hatchability of eggs laid by larger flies.",1992,"Elke Hillesheim, Stephen C Stearns, Elke Hillesheim, Stephen C Stearns"

We show that the number of eggs laid by a female depends upon the number of genes encoding yolk polypeptides present in the genome and furthermore that the probability of an egg hatching into an adult also critically depends upon the number of yolk protein genes present in the mother. This suggests that the three yolk protein-encoding genes in Drosophila melanogaster may have arisen by duplication, then been maintained for quantitative reasons because they increased egg production and fertility, rather than each protein evolving a different function as is the case with most small gene families, such as tubulins and collagen genes.",1991,"M Bownes, K Lineruth, D Mauchline, M Bownes, K Lineruth, D Mauchline"

The cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) has been chosen as a novel energy source to be supplemented in food during larval development. The effects have been assessed at the phenotypic level for larval survival and development time and at the genotypic level for the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpdh) loci. Supplemented NAD was found to increase survival at the lower temperatures and decrease survival at the higher temperatures. Further, for each temperature, NAD decreased development time although this effect diminished as temperature increased. There were no significant effects at the genotypic level. Hence a phenotypic approach studying the effects of environmental stresses and novel energy availability may be useful in understanding fitness variation in Drosophila populations.",1988,"M J Kohane, M J Kohane"

Like an early-emerging strain previously isolated in Drosophila pseudoobscura, the psi strains have slightly lengthened periods for the circadian rhythm in adult emergence. In addition, psi-2 brings about an abnormal synchronization of locomotor activity to light-dark cycles and lengthens periods for the activity rhythm.

A polynomial regression fits the best the results: the speed of acquisition of this kind of learning decreases between the ages of 3 and 35 days, a plateau being observed in flies older than 35 days. Similar results have been previously obtained using associative learning tasks of increasing complexity. These effects of age could be due to a memory impairment, but also to deficits in the process of central inhibition of irrelevant motor responses.",1991,"C Fois, J Médioni, E Le Bourg, C Fois, J Médioni, E Le Bourg"

The origin of postembryonic neuroblasts in the ventral nerve cord of Drosophila melanogaster,1901786,,"Embryonic and postembryonic neuroblasts in the thoracic ventral nerve cord of Drosophila melanogaster have the same origin. We have traced the development of threefold-labelled single precursor cells from the early gastrula stage to late larval stages. The technique allows in the same individual monitoring of progeny cells at embryonic stages (in vivo) and differentially staining embryonic and postembryonic progeny within the resulting neural clone at late postembryonic stages. The analysis reveals that postembryonic cells always appear together with embryonic cells in one clone. Furthermore, BrdU labelling suggests that the embryonic neuroblast itself rather than one of its progeny resumes proliferation as a postembryonic neuroblast. A second type of clone consists of embryonic progeny only.",1991,"A Prokop, G M Technau, A Prokop, G M Technau"
The yellow condition in Drosophila melanogaster. A biological structuralist approach to the study of phenocopies,2128129,,"A phenocopy, as defined by Goldschmidt, is an environmentally induced form which resembles a genetic mutant. They have a site of induction at a number of developmental levels and are not only produced by interfering with gene gene expression. Phenocopies and the corresponding genetic mutant, are also not necessarily generated through equivalent developmental pathways. The yellow phenocopy of Drosophila melanogaster, where both cuticle colour and mating behaviour resembles that of the yellow mutant, serves to illustrate the above points. It is suggested that if the term phenocopy is to be used the term should correspond to the generative processes and hence transformations which mutant and phenocopy share, rather than purely on phenotype. Finally, phenocopies are discussed in relation to structuralist biology, showing how they are instructive in describing generative processes, sensitive periods in development and differing modes of inheritance in such a research programme.",1990,"R D Newcomb, R D Newcomb"

Genetic Differentiation between Geographically Distant Populations of DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,17246085,,"We have studied allozyme variation at 26 gene loci in nine populations of Drosophila melanogaster originating on five different continents. The distant populations show significant genetic differentiation. However, only half of the loci studied have contributed to this differentiation; the other half show identical patterns in all populations. The genetic differentiation in North American, European and African populations is correlated with the major climatic differences between north and south. These differences arise mainly from seven loci that show gene-frequency patterns suggestive of latitudinal clines in allele frequencies. The clinal variation is such that subtropical populations are more heterozygous than temperate populations. These results are discussed in relation to the selectionist and neutralist hypotheses of genetic variation in natural populations.",1982,"R S Singh, D A Hickey, J David, R S Singh, D A Hickey, J David"
Effect of overwintering on the frequency of flies infected by the rhabdovirus sigma in experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster,6794545,10.1007/BF01317340,"Artificial overwintering, assuming that adulthood is the overwintering stage, has been performed on six experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster. In five of them, the frequency of flies infected by the hereditary Rhabdovirus sigma is always in the first spring generation than it was in the last generation of the preceding fall. This result might indicate a higher sensitivity of infected flies to winter conditions, but other interpretations, connected with the genes for resistance to the virus might be considered. In one of the six populations, no effect was detected after any of the three successive winters. It appears therefore that the genetic background of the flies or/and of the propagated virus intervenes in the response to overwintering.",1981,"A Fleuriet, A Fleuriet"

Segmental effects are also a function of the genetical background, which, in this case, constitutes material within the same chromosome.

The increase of the mutation frequency was noted by brood-pattern method after fractionated treatment of spermatocytes and spermatogonia only with EMS.

In addition, it is much reduced in activity in a number of xanthommatin-deficient mutants (v, cn, st, cd, and w).

This cell-autonomous neurodegenerative pathway is initiated following axon injury, and in Drosophila, involves activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase highwire.

Positive geotactic behaviors induced by geomagnetic field in Drosophila,27192976,10.1186/s13041-016-0235-1,"Background:
      
    

    
      Appropriate vertical movement is critical for the survival of flying animals. Although negative geotaxis (moving away from Earth) driven by gravity has been extensively studied, much less is understood concerning a static regulatory mechanism for inducing positive geotaxis (moving toward Earth).
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism, we showed that geomagnetic field (GMF) induces positive geotaxis and antagonizes negative gravitaxis. Remarkably, GMF acts as a sensory cue for an appetite-driven associative learning behavior through the GMF-induced positive geotaxis. This GMF-induced positive geotaxis requires the three geotaxis genes, such as cry, pyx and pdf, and the corresponding neurons residing in Johnston's organ of the fly's antennae.

In the wing-spot assay, an increase in the frequency of mutant spots was observed in the wings of the adults; CuONPs were more effective than was CuSO4. Both agents induced TBARS; again, CuONPs were more active than was CuSO4. The results indicate that CuONPs are genotoxic in Drosophila, and these effects may be mediated by oxidative stress.

However, the sperm and the oocyte modify or lose their centrosomes. Consequently, how the zygote establishes its first centrosome, and in particular, the origin of the second zygotic centriole, is uncertain. Drosophila melanogaster spermatids contain a single centriole called the Giant Centriole (GC) and a Proximal centriole-like (PCL) structure whose function is unknown. We found that, like the centriole, the PCL loses its protein markers at the end of spermiogenesis. After fertilization, the first two centrioles are observed via the recruitment of the zygotic PCM proteins and are seen in asterless mutant embryos that cannot form centrioles. The zygote's centriolar proteins label only the daughter centrioles of the first two centrioles.

Three kinds of RNA editing were detected at 20 sites around the terminal inverted repeats (TIR); 15 A-to-G, four U-to-C, and one C-to-U conversions. A-to-G conversions are suggested to be attributed to A-to-I RNA editing on KP element RNAs, because inosine (I) in RNA is recognized as G by reverse transcriptase.

We found that within populations, different Drosophila genotypes show wide-ranging variation in their ability to survive infection with the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. Furthermore, striking divergence in susceptibility has occurred between genotypes from temperate and tropical African locations. We hypothesize that this may have been driven by adaptation to local differences in pathogen exposure or host ecology. Genetic variation within populations may be maintained by temporal or spatial variation in the costs and benefits of pathogen defence. Insect pathogens are employed widely as biological control agents and entomopathogenic fungi are currently being developed for reducing malaria transmission by mosquitoes.

No substantial increase in female reproductive period in Indyp115/Hk heterozygotes was found. In homozygotes for allele Indyp115, we have previously revealed two phases of embryotic lethality and lethality at the larval and pupa stages.

Maternal transmission of P element transposase activity in Drosophila melanogaster depends on the last P intron,12077325,10.1073/pnas.142304199,"Maternal transmission of RNAs or proteins through the egg cytoplasm plays an important role in eukaryotic development. We show that the transposase activity encoded by the P transposable element of Drosophila melanogaster is transmitted through the oocytes of females heterozygous for this element even when these oocytes do not carry the element itself. However, this maternal transmission is abolished when the last of three introns is removed from the P element. These facts imply that maternal transmission of transposase activity involves the RNA transcribed from the P element rather than the polypeptide it encodes, and that to be transmitted maternally, this RNA must possess the last intron. Examination of the intron's sequence reveals that it contains a motif of nine nucleotides that has been implicated in the maternal transmission of developmentally significant RNAs.

Molecular and pharmacological properties of insect biogenic amine receptors: lessons from Drosophila melanogaster and Apis mellifera,11519073,10.1002/arch.1055,"In the central nervous system (CNS) of both vertebrates and invertebrates, biogenic amines are important neuroactive molecules. Physiologically, they can act as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, or neurohormones. Biogenic amines control and regulate various vital functions including circadian rhythms, endocrine secretion, cardiovascular control, emotions, as well as learning and memory. In insects, amines like dopamine, tyramine, octopamine, serotonin, and histamine exert their effects by binding to specific membrane proteins that primarily belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. Especially in Drosophila melanogaster and Apis mellifera considerable progress has been achieved during the last few years towards the understanding of the functional role of these receptors and their intracellular signaling systems. In this review, the present knowledge on the biochemical, molecular, and pharmacological properties of biogenic amine receptors from Drosophila and Apis will be summarized.

Genetic variation in rates of nondisjunction: association of two naturally occurring polymorphisms in the chromokinesin nod with increased rates of nondisjunction in Drosophila melanogaster,10430586,,"Genetic variation in nondisjunction frequency among X chromosomes from two Drosophila melanogaster natural populations is examined in a sensitized assay. A high level of genetic variation is observed (a range of 0.006-0.241). Two naturally occurring variants at the nod locus, a chromokinesin required for proper achiasmate chromosome segregation, are significantly associated with an increased frequency of nondisjunction. Both of these polymorphisms are found at intermediate frequency in widely distributed natural populations. To account for these observations, we propose a general model incorporating unique opportunities for meiotic drive during female meiosis. The oötid competition model can account for both high mean rates of female-specific nondisjunction in Drosophila and humans as well as the standing genetic variation in this critical fitness character in natural populations.",1999,"M E Zwick, J L Salstrom, C H Langley, M E Zwick, J L Salstrom, C H Langley"
Antisense suppression of the putative ribosomal protein S3A gene disrupts ovarian development in Drosophila melanogaster,9393444,10.1007/s004380050590,"The Drosophila melanogaster homologue of the Anopheles gambiae C3 cDNA has been isolated and characterized by sequence analysis. The encoded protein was localized by immunochemical and immunocytochemical methods. The Drosophila C3 protein is highly similar to homologues of disputed function, which have previously been identified in fungi, plants and animals. The protein is ubiquitous and localized in the cytoplasm. Cell fractionation followed by detection with a specific antibody preparation shows that the protein is associated with the 40S ribosomal subunit. The C3 gene is located in section 101F of chromosome 4. Antisense transgenic analysis shows that this gene is essential for oogenesis. The most prominent phenotype resulting from antisense depletion of C3 RNA is disappearance of the follicular cells of the ovary (where the concentration of C3 protein is normally high) and abnormalities of the associated germline derivatives, leading to failure of egg production.",1997,"E Reynaud, V N Bolshakov, V Barajas, F C Kafatos, M Zurita, E Reynaud, V N Bolshakov, V Barajas, F C Kafatos, M Zurita"

Deuterium oxide lengthens the free-running circadian period. We tested the effects of deuterium on three mutants of the per gene (pers, perL, and per0) and wild-type Drosophila melanogaster (per+) to assess interactions. With increasing concentrations of deuterium, the free-running circadian period of locomotor activity rhythms increased. The dose-response was linear in all genotypes tested. With increasing dosages of deuterium, circadian rhythms became weaker as evidenced by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Genotype and deuterium changed circadian period length independently and additively, showing no interaction. SNRs for all genotypes converged on a low level as deuterium concentration increased.

Ontogeny of a biological clock in Drosophila melanogaster,1741397,10.1073/pnas.89.4.1423,"Drosophila melanogaster born and reared in constant darkness exhibit circadian locomotor activity rhythms as adults. However, the rhythms of the individual flies composing these populations are not synchronized with one another. This lack of synchrony is evident in populations of flies commencing development at the same time, indicating that a biological clock controlling circadian rhythmicity in Drosophila begins to function without a requirement for light and without a developmentally imparted phase. It is possible to synchronize the phases of rhythms produced by dark-reared flies with light treatments ending as early as the developmental transition from embryo to first-instar larva: Light treatments occurring at developmental times preceding hatching of the first-instar larva fail to synchronize adult locomotor activity rhythms, while treatments ending at completion of larval hatching entrain these rhythms. The synchronized rhythmic behavior of adult flies receiving such light treatments suggests that a clock controlling circadian rhythms may function continuously from the time of larval hatching to adulthood.",1992,"A Sehgal, J Price, M W Young, A Sehgal, J Price, M W Young"
Mechanism of action of Drosophila melanogaster alcohol dehydrogenase,1804107,,"Reported kinetic pH dependence data for alcohol dehydrogenase from Drosophila melanogaster are analyzed with regard to differences in rate behaviour between this non-metallo enzyme and the zinc-containing liver alcohol dehydrogenase present in vertebrates.

Such proton release involves an ionizing group with a pKa of about 7.6 in the enzyme.NAD+ complex, tentatively identified as a tyrosyl residue. The ionized form of this group is proposed to participate in the binding of alcohol substrates and to act as a nucleophilic catalyst of the subsequent step of hydride ion transfer from the bound alcohol to NAD+.

No P factors active for potential GD sterility were found in these populations. But search for the M cytotype, which causes susceptibility to the P factors, and for the P cytotype, which causes resistance to the P factors, showed that both populations are polymorphic for the cytotypes. Such a polymorphism seems to be stable in the wild, at least over a 2-year period. Mutator activity (measured by generated mutations at the sn and ras loci) was found to be present.

Also, the oxygen-poisoned flies showed a loss of the cytoplasmic membranes of the sperm cells, an alteration which was previously found in y-irradiated, but not in normal senescent, flies. In our opinion, oxygen poisoning of Drosophila may provide a valid model of accelerated aging, at least in regard to peroxidation injury of cell organelles and ceroid-lipofuscin accumulation.",1975,"J Miquel, P R Lundgren, K G Bensch, J Miquel, P R Lundgren, K G Bensch"

Additionally, in constant and variable climatic scenarios, flies shifted to the right the optimum temperature but the maximum performance decreased only in flies reared on high temperatures and high thermal variability.

This contact-chemosensation is essential for animals to discriminate between nutritious and contaminated foods. In this study, we characterized the function of gustatory receptors that play a dual role in feeding and oviposition using the plant metabolite umbelliferone.

Dorsal closure is a morphogenetic process similar to wound healing, whereby a gap in the epithelium is closed through the coordinated action of different cell types. Surprisingly, this complex process requires microtubule function exclusively in epithelial cells and only for the last step, the zippering, which seals the gap. Preceding zippering, the epithelial microtubules reorganize to attain an unusual spatial distribution, which we describe with subcellular resolution in the intact, living organism. We provide a clearly defined example where cells of a developing organism transiently reorganize their microtubules to fulfill a specialized morphogenetic task.",2006,"Ferenc Jankovics, Damian Brunner, Ferenc Jankovics, Damian Brunner"

These females, whether they have eggs or not, extrude their ovipositors toward courting males as frequently as do fertilized females. However, this rejection behavior was ineffective in suppressing male courtship. Of females with eggs, about half of them could suppress male courtship. Females lacking eggs could not suppress male courtship and continued to elicit vigorous courtship. This difference seems to account for the increased mating frequency in sterilized females. Courtship behavior by mutant males defective in olfaction or learning suggested that females are capable of repelling males by emitting a volatile pheromone(s) with an inhibitory effect on male courtship.",1997,"Y Fuyama, M Ueyama, Y Fuyama, M Ueyama"

Reproduction had a much more marked effect on fertility than survival: males with a history of reproduction showed complete sterility at a time when upwards of 80% of their cohort were still alive. Analyses of survival rates alone gave a misleading measure of the impact of ageing. Sterility appeared to be attributable mainly to a reduction in sperm count. Early reproduction caused permanent, irreversible damage to both survival and fecundity, with risk playing an apparently minor role. Individual differences in frailty appeared to be of little consequence for the interpretation of these reversal experiments, although its possible occurrence made definite detection of risk difficult.",1997,"L Partridge, N Prowse, L Partridge, N Prowse"
pH-dependent actions of THIP and ZAPA on an ionotropic Drosophila melanogaster GABA receptor,8955956,10.1016/s0006-8993(96)00998-5,"The actions of THIP (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol) and ZAPA (Z-3-[(aminoiminomethyl)thio]prop-2-enoic acid) were tested on an ionotropic homo-oligomeric GABA receptor of Drosophila melanogaster. The amplitude of currents activated by THIP and ZAPA declined rapidly during agonist application and a rebound response was observed on washout. By correcting the pH shift induced by these acid salts, responses more typical of GABA agonists were seen. Less striking pH-dependence was observed in the case of GABA responses.",1996,"K Matsuda, A M Hosie, S D Buckingham, M D Squire, H A Baylis, D B Sattelle, K Matsuda, A M Hosie, S D Buckingham, M D Squire, H A Baylis, D B Sattelle"

Between them, these strains formed a representative sample of the genetic variability of a natural population. Period, phase, definition (the degree to which a rhythmic signal was obscured by noise), and rhythm waveform were all found to vary continuously among the strains, although within each strain the rhythm phenotype was remarkably consistent.

The protective effects against knock-down on the 2nd day and lethality on the 8th day after irradiation were not affected by the radiation sensitivity and DNA repair capacity of the strains. Ether (4.2%) in oxygen was more effective than ether in air for both endpoints. The protective effects may be due to damages not involving cell division, since no mitotic cells are observed in adult flies except in gonadal glands. A change in the orderliness of the cell membrane by ether is suggested to be the cause of the protective effects.",1992,"T Megumi, S Gamo, Y Tsujii, T Megumi, S Gamo, Y Tsujii"

Genotype and anesthetic determine mate choice in Drosophila melanogaster,2111987,10.1007/BF01070742,"Genetic differences that influence mating preferences were studied in genetically defined lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Initial results suggested substantial differences between two types of females with respect to the types of male preferred as mates, but further experimentation showed that the mating patterns were conditional on the mode of anesthesia (CO2 versus ether). In a statistical test of independence, the major determinant of mating choice in these experiments was due to an interaction effect between genotypes and mode of anesthesia. The observations might be explained by the differential sensitivity of male genotypes to ether. Etherization at emergence has lasting effects on mating behavior; it alters not only the latency and frequency of mating 4 days later, but also the pattern of matings observed.",1990,"D Joachim, J W Curtsinger, D Joachim, J W Curtsinger"

Results confirm significant differences in olfactory response to ethyl alcohol and acetaldehyde in both populations and to ethyl acetate in the Sandiche population.

Heterosis was more pronounced in the poor nutritional conditions. Two electrophoretic markers used to estimate the level of heterozygosity in F2 and backcrosses revealed an excess of heterozygous genotypes. Quantitative genetic effects (an additive line effect and individual and maternal heterosis) were estimated for both traits in the two environments.

The distribution of measures of density sensitivity of chromosomal homozygotes is different from that of random chromosomal heterozygotes for both location and dispersion. Density sensitivity of the components is about as variable as any of the fitness components themselves at fixed densities. The consequences of the exact nature of this density dependence are discussed with respect to the stage of the life cycle at which density dependence occurs, and the mathematical form that it takes.

Addition of beta-alanine to cuticles from which nonchitinous materials have been removed with alkali converts the loose arrangement of the microfibrils to a compact and sharply delineated arrangement. beta-alanine also accelerates tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidation of N-acetyldopamine by reacting with the oxidized product of the reaction to produce an orange-red complex. Similarly, beta-alanine accelerates oxidation of N-acetyldopamine when these two substances are added to fluids from the hemocoel, to lead to tanning instead of normal blackening. These findings may help explain why beta-alanine induces tanning while inhibiting melanization in insects.",1980,"M E Jacobs, M E Jacobs"

A fine-scale genetic analysis of hybrid incompatibilities in Drosophila,12663535,,"The sterility and inviability of species hybrids is thought to evolve by the accumulation of genes that cause generally recessive, incompatible epistatic interactions between species. Most analyses of the loci involved in such hybrid incompatibilities have suffered from low genetic resolution. Here I present a fine-resolution genetic screen that allows systematic counting, mapping, and characterizing of a large number of hybrid incompatibility loci in a model genetic system. Using small autosomal deletions from D. melanogaster and a hybrid rescue mutation from D. simulans, I measured the viability of hybrid males that are simultaneously hemizygous for a small region of the D. simulans autosomal genome and hemizygous for the D. melanogaster X chromosome. These hybrid males are exposed to the full effects of any recessive-recessive epistatic incompatibilities present in these regions. A screen of approximately 70% of the D. simulans autosomal genome reveals 20 hybrid-lethal and 20 hybrid-semilethal regions that are incompatible with the D. melanogaster X. In further crosses, I confirm the epistatic nature of hybrid lethality by showing that all of the incompatibilities are rescued when the D. melanogaster X is replaced with a D. simulans X. Combined with information from previous studies, these results show that the number of recessive incompatibilities is approximately eightfold larger than the number of dominant ones. Finally, I estimate that a total of approximately 191 hybrid-lethal incompatibilities separate D. melanogaster and D. simulans, indicating extensive functional divergence between these species' genomes.",2003,"Daven C Presgraves, Daven C Presgraves"

Loss-of-function mutations are responsible for a specific infantile or childhood-onset mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy with a chronic clinical course. Patients deficient in COA8 show specific COX deficiency with distinctive neuroimaging features, i.e., cavitating leukodystrophy. In human cells, COA8 is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, but oxidative stress stabilizes the protein, which is then involved in COX assembly, possibly by protecting the complex from oxidative damage. However, its precise function remains unknown. The CG14806 gene (dCOA8) is the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of human COA8 encoding a highly conserved COA8 protein. We report that dCOA8 knockdown (KD) flies show locomotor defects, and other signs of neurological impairment, reduced COX enzymatic activity, and reduced lifespan under oxidative stress conditions.

Tissue-specific transcription of the neuronal gene Lim3 affects Drosophila melanogaster lifespan and locomotion,28466185,10.1007/s10522-017-9704-x,"The identity of neuronal cell types is established and maintained by the expression of neuronal genes coding for ion channels, neurotransmitters, and neuropeptides, among others. Some of these genes have been shown to affect lifespan; however, their role in lifespan control remains largely unclear. The Drosophila melanogaster gene Lim3 encodes a transcription factor involved in complicated motor neuron specification networks. We previously identified Lim3 as a candidate gene affecting lifespan. To obtain direct evidence of the involvement of Lim3 in lifespan control, Lim3 overexpression and RNAi knockdown were induced in the nervous system and muscles of Drosophila using the GAL4-UAS binary system. We demonstrated that Lim3 knockdown in the nervous system increased survival at an early age and that Lim3 knockdown in muscles both increased survival at an early age and extended median lifespan, directly establishing the involvement of Lim3 in lifespan control. Lim3 overexpression in nerves and muscles was deleterious and led to lethality and decreased lifespan, respectively. Lim3 misexpression in both nerves and muscles increased locomotion regardless of changes in lifespan, which indicated that the effects of Lim3 on lifespan and locomotion can be uncoupled. Decreased synaptic activity was observed in the neuromuscular junctions of individuals with Lim3 overexpression in muscles, in association with decreased lifespan. However, no changes in NMJ activity were associated with the positive shift in locomotion observed in all misexpression genotypes. Our data suggested that modifications in the microtubule network may be induced by Lim3 misexpression in muscles and cause an increase in locomotion.",2017,"Olga Y Rybina, Svetlana V Sarantseva, Ekaterina R Veselkina, Olga I Bolschakova, Alexander V Symonenko, Anna V Krementsova, Elena V Ryabova, Natalia V Roshina, Elena G Pasyukova, Olga Y Rybina, Svetlana V Sarantseva, Ekaterina R Veselkina, Olga I Bolschakova, Alexander V Symonenko, Anna V Krementsova, Elena V Ryabova, Natalia V Roshina, Elena G Pasyukova"
X-to-autosome expression and msl-2 transcript abundance correlate among Drosophila melanogaster somatic tissues,25737812,10.7717/peerj.771,"In Drosophila melanogaster, the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex has been studied extensively for its role in upregulating male X-linked genes. Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have improved our understanding of how the MSL complex mediates dosage compensation through chromosome-wide chromatin modifications. Most studies, however, have focused on cell line models that cannot reflect any potential heterogeneity of in vivo dosage compensation. Comparisons between cell line and organismal gene-level dosage compensation upregulation suggest the possibility of variation in MSL complex activity among somatic tissues. We hypothesize the degree, up to but not exceeding 2-fold, to which the MSL complex upregulates male X-linked genes varies quantitatively by tissue type. In this model, MSL complex abundance acts as a rheostat to control the extent of upregulation. Using publicly available expression data, we provide evidence for our model in Drosophila somatic tissues. Specifically, we find X-to-autosome expression correlates with the tissue-specific expression of msl-2 which encodes an essential male-specific component of the MSL complex. This result suggests MSL complex mediated dosage compensation varies quantitatively by tissue type. Furthermore, this result has consequences for models explaining the organismal-scale molecular and evolutionary consequences of MSL-mediated dosage compensation.",2015,"Steven P Vensko Ii, Eric A Stone, Steven P Vensko Ii, Eric A Stone"

Herbs commonly used for this purpose are Zandopa (containing Mucuna pruriens), Withania somnifera, Centella asiatica, Sida cordifolia and Bacopa monnieri. In this study, these herbs were tested for their potential ability to improve climbing ability of a fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) PD model based on loss of function of phosphatase and tensin-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1). Fruit flies were cultured on food containing individual herbs or herbal formulations, a combination of all five herbs, levodopa (positive control) or no treatment (negative control). Tests were performed in both PINK1 mutant flies and healthy wild-type (WT) flies. A significant improvement in climbing ability was observed in flies treated with B. monnieri compared with untreated PINK1 mutant flies. However, a significant decrease in climbing ability was observed in WT flies for the same herb. Centella asiatica also significantly decreased climbing ability in WT flies. No significant effects were observed with any of the other herbs in either PINK1 or WT flies compared with untreated flies.",2014,"R L M Jansen, B Brogan, A J Whitworth, E J Okello, R L M Jansen, B Brogan, A J Whitworth, E J Okello"

Muscle function and homeostasis require cytokine inhibition of AKT activity in Drosophila,31944178,10.7554/eLife.51595,"Unpaired ligands are secreted signals that act via a GP130-like receptor, domeless, to activate JAK/STAT signalling in Drosophila. Like many mammalian cytokines, unpaireds can be activated by infection and other stresses and can promote insulin resistance in target tissues. However, the importance of this effect in non-inflammatory physiology is unknown. Here, we identify a requirement for unpaired-JAK signalling as a metabolic regulator in healthy adult Drosophila muscle. Adult muscles show basal JAK-STAT signalling activity in the absence of any immune challenge. Plasmatocytes (Drosophila macrophages) are an important source of this tonic signal. Loss of the dome receptor on adult muscles significantly reduces lifespan and causes local and systemic metabolic pathology. These pathologies result from hyperactivation of AKT and consequent deregulation of metabolism. Thus, we identify a cytokine signal that must be received in muscle to control AKT activity and metabolic homeostasis.",2020,"Katrin Kierdorf, Fabian Hersperger, Jessica Sharrock, Crystal M Vincent, Pinar Ustaoglu, Jiawen Dou, Attila Gyoergy, Olaf Groß, Daria E Siekhaus, Marc S Dionne, Katrin Kierdorf, Fabian Hersperger, Jessica Sharrock, Crystal M Vincent, Pinar Ustaoglu, Jiawen Dou, Attila Gyoergy, Olaf Groß, Daria E Siekhaus, Marc S Dionne"
The manifold structure of limb coordination in walking Drosophila,31250807,10.7554/eLife.46409,"Terrestrial locomotion requires animals to coordinate their limb movements to efficiently traverse their environment. While previous studies in hexapods have reported that limb coordination patterns can vary substantially, the structure of this variability is not yet well understood. Here, we characterized the symmetric and asymmetric components of variation in walking kinematics in the genetic model organism Drosophila. We found that Drosophila use a single continuum of coordination patterns without evidence for preferred configurations. Spontaneous symmetric variability was associated with modulation of a single control parameter-stance duration-while asymmetric variability consisted of small, limb-specific modulations along multiple dimensions of the underlying symmetric pattern. Commands that modulated walking speed, originating from artificial neural activation or from the visual system, evoked modulations consistent with spontaneous behavior.

Protein Kinase D Is Dispensable for Development and Survival of Drosophila melanogaster,31142547,10.1534/g3.119.400307,"Members of the Protein Kinase D (PKD) family are involved in numerous cellular processes in mammals, including cell survival after oxidative stress, polarized transport of Golgi vesicles, as well as cell migration and invasion. PKD proteins belong to the PKC/CAMK class of serine/threonine kinases, and transmit diacylglycerol-regulated signals. Whereas three PKD isoforms are known in mammals, Drosophila melanogaster contains a single PKD homolog. Previous analyses using overexpression and RNAi studies indicated likewise multi-facetted roles for Drosophila PKD, including the regulation of secretory transport and actin-cytoskeletal dynamics. Recently, involvement in growth regulation has been proposed based on the hypomorphic dPKDH allele. We have generated PKD null alleles that are homozygous viable without apparent phenotype. They largely match control flies regarding fertility, developmental timing and weight. Males, but not females, are slightly shorter lived and starvation sensitive. Furthermore, migration of pole cells in embryos and border cells in oocytes appears normal. PKD mutants tolerate heat, cold and osmotic stress like the control but are sensitive to oxidative stress, conforming to the described role for mammalian PKDs. A candidate screen to identify functionally redundant kinases uncovered genetic interactions of PKD with Pkcδ, sqa and Drak mutants, further supporting the role of PKD in oxidative stress response, and suggesting its involvement in starvation induced autophagy and regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. Overall, PKD appears dispensable for fly development and survival presumably due to redundancy, but influences environmental responses.",2019,"Dieter Maier, Anja C Nagel, Alexandra Kelp, Anette Preiss, Dieter Maier, Anja C Nagel, Alexandra Kelp, Anette Preiss"
Genetic dissection of trophic interactions in the larval optic neuropil of Drosophila melanogaster,16168982,10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.08.030,"The larval visual system of Drosophila melanogaster consists of two bilateral clusters of 12 photoreceptors, which express Rhodopsin 5 and 6 (Rh5 and Rh6) in a non-overlapping manner. These neurons send their axons in a fascicle, the larval optic nerve (LON), which terminates in the larval optic neuropil. The LON is required for the development of a serotonergic arborization originating in the central brain and for the development of the dendritic tree of the circadian pacemakers, the small ventral lateral neurons (LNv) [Malpel, S., Klarsfeld, A., Rouyer, F., 2002.

The experiments described here aimed at determining whether Rh5- or Rh6-expressing fibers, as well as the LNv, influence the development of this serotonergic arborization. We conclude that Rh6-expressing fibers play a unique role in providing a signal required for the outgrowth and branching of the serotonergic arborization. Moreover, the innervation of the larval optic neuropil by the 5-HT arborization depends on intact Rac function. A possible role for these serotonergic processes in modulating the larval circadian rhythmicity and photoreceptor function is discussed.",2005,"Verónica G Rodriguez Moncalvo, Ana Regina Campos, Verónica G Rodriguez Moncalvo, Ana Regina Campos"
DNA polymerase delta from embryos of Drosophila melanogaster,8415662,10.1073/pnas.90.19.9105,"We have purified a DNA polymerase activity from 0- to 2-hr embryos of Drosophila melanogaster to near homogeneity. The purified enzyme consists of a single 120-kDa polypeptide, which contains polymerase and 3'-->5' exonuclease activities. Exonuclease activity is inhibited by deoxynucleoside triphosphates, suggesting that the polymerase and exonuclease activities are coupled. The polymerase is more active with poly(dA-dT) than with activated DNA or poly(dA)/oligo(dT) as template. It shows a low degree of processivity with poly(dA)/oligo(dT). The polymerase is sensitive to aphidicolin and carbonyldiphosphonate but resistant to N2-[p-(n-butyl)phenyl]-2-deoxyguanosine triphosphate, 2-[p-(n-butyl)anilino]-2-deoxyadenosine triphosphate, and dideoxythymidine triphosphate. The 120-kDa polypeptide can be distinguished from the large subunit of Drosophila DNA polymerase alpha on the basis of the peptides generated by partial cleavage with N-chlorosuccinimide and by its failure to react with a monoclonal antibody directed against the large subunit of DNA polymerase alpha. The DNA polymerase is inhibited by 200 mM NaCl and is unable to use poly(rA)/oligo(dT) as a template, thus differentiating it from DNA polymerase gamma.

Effects of a sex ratio gradient on female mate-copying and choosiness in Drosophila melanogaster,30402066,10.1093/cz/zoy014,"In many sexually reproducing species, individuals can gather information about potential mates by observing their mating success. This behavioral pattern, that we call mate-copying, was reported in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster where females choosing between 2 males of contrasting phenotypes can build a preference for males of the phenotype they previously saw being chosen by a demonstrator female. As sex ratio is known to affect mate choice, our goal was to test whether mate-copying is also affected by encountered sex ratios. Thus, we created a gradient of sex ratio during demonstrations of mate-copying experiments by changing the number of females observing from a central arena 6 simultaneous demonstrations unfolding in 6 peripheral compartments of a hexagonal device. We also tested whether the sex ratio experienced by females during demonstrations affected their choosiness (male courtship duration and double courtship rate) in subsequent mate-choice tests. Experimental male:female sex ratio during demonstrations did not affect mate-copying indices, but positively affected the proportion of both males courting the female during mate-choice tests, as well as male courtship duration, the latter potentially explaining the former relationship. As expected, the sex ratio affected female choosiness positively, and Drosophila females seem to have evolved a mate-copying ability independently of sex ratio, and a capacity to adapt their choosiness to male availability. This suggests that, as in many animal species, individuals, especially females, can adapt their mate choice depending on the current sex ratio.",2018,"Magdalena Monier, Sabine Nöbel, Guillaume Isabel, Etienne Danchin, Handling editor: David Bierbach, Magdalena Monier, Sabine Nöbel, Guillaume Isabel, Etienne Danchin, Handling editor: David Bierbach"
Isoform-specific expression of the neuropeptide orcokinin in Drosophila melanogaster,25600008,10.1016/j.peptides.2015.01.002,"Orcokinins are neuropeptides that have been identified in diverse arthropods. In some species, an orcokinin gene encodes two isoforms of mature orcokinin peptide through alternative mRNA splicing. The existence of two orcokinin isoforms was predicted in Drosophila melanogaster as well, but the expression pattern of both isoforms has not been characterized. Here, we use in situ hybridization, antibody staining, and enhancer fusion GAL4 transgenic flies to examine the expression patterns of the A and B forms of orcokinin, and provide evidence that they are expressed differentially in the central nervous system (CNS) and the intestinal enteroendocrine system. The orcokinin A isoform is mainly expressed in the CNS of both larvae and adults. The A form is expressed in 5 pairs of neurons in abdominal neuromeres 1-5 of the larval CNS. In the adult brain, the A form is expressed in one pair of neurons in the posteriorlateral protocerebrum, and an additional four pairs of neurons located near the basement of the accessory medulla. Orcokinin A expression is also observed in two pairs of neurons in the ventral nerve cord (VNC). The orcokinin B form is mainly expressed in intestinal enteroendocrine cells in the larva and adult, with additional expression in one unpaired neuron in the adult abdominal ganglion. Together, our results provide elucidation of the existence and differential expression of the two orcokinin isoforms in the Drosophila brain and gut, setting the stage for future functional studies of orcokinins utilizing the genetically amenable fly model.",2015,"Ji Chen, Min Sung Choi, Akira Mizoguchi, Jan A Veenstra, KyeongJin Kang, Young-Joon Kim, Jae Young Kwon, Ji Chen, Min Sung Choi, Akira Mizoguchi, Jan A Veenstra, KyeongJin Kang, Young-Joon Kim, Jae Young Kwon"
Latent force models for describing transcriptional regulation processes in the embryo development problem for the Drosophila melanogaster,25569966,10.1109/EMBC.2014.6943598,"In the embryo development problem for the Drosophila melanogaster, a set of molecules known as mor-phogens are responsible for the embryo segmentation. These morphogens are encoded by different genes, including the GAP genes, maternal coordination genes and pair-rule genes. One of the maternal coordination genes encodes the Bicoid morphogen, which is the responsible for the development of the Drosophila embryo at the anterior part and for the control and regulation of the GAP genes in segmentation of the early development of the Drosophila melanogaster. The work presented in this document, reports a methodology that tends to integrate mechanistic and data driven based models, aiming at making inference over the mRNA Bicoid from gene expression data at the protein level for the Bicoid morphogen. The fundamental contribution of this work is the description of the concentration gradient of the Bicoid morphogen in the continuous spatio-temporal domain as well as the output regression (gene expression at protein level) using a Gaussian process described by a mechanistically inspired covariance function. Regression results and metrics computed for the Bicoid protein expression both in the temporal and spatial domains, showed outstanding performance with respect to reported experiments from previous studies.

Excitatory and inhibitory switches for courtship in the brain of Drosophila melanogaster,15062094,10.1016/j.cub.2004.03.037,"Background:
      
    

    
      Courtship is the best-studied behavior in Drosophila melanogaster, and work on its anatomical basis has concentrated mainly on the functional identification of sexually dimorphic sites in the brain. Much less is known of the more expansive, nondimorphic, but nonetheless essential, neural elements subserving male courtship behavior.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Sites in the CNS mediating initiation and early steps of male courtship in Drosophila melanogaster were identified by analyzing the behavior of mosaic flies expressing transgenes designed either to suppress neurotransmission or enhance neuronal excitability. Suppression of neurotransmission was accomplished by means of the dominantly acting, temperature-sensitive dynamin mutation shibire(ts1), whereas enhanced neuronal excitability was produced by means of a novel, dominantly acting, truncated eag potassium channel. By using a new, landmark-based procedure for aligning diverse expression patterns among the various mosaic strains, a comparison of courtship performance and affected brain sites in strains expressing the transgenes identified a cluster of cells in the posterior lateral protocerebrum that exerts reciprocal effects on the initiation of courtship, suppressing it when they are inactivated and enhancing it when they are hyperactivated, indicative of cells that normally play an excitatory, triggering role. A separate group of nearby cells, slightly more anterior in the lateral protocerebrum, was found to inhibit courtship when its activity is enhanced, indicative of an inhibitory role in courtship.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      A cluster of cells, some excitatory and some inhibitory, in the lateral protocerebrum regulates courtship initiation in Drosophila. These cells are likely to be an integration center for the multiple sensory inputs that trigger male courtship.",2004,"Susan J Broughton, Toshihiro Kitamoto, Ralph J Greenspan, Susan J Broughton, Toshihiro Kitamoto, Ralph J Greenspan"
Application of a time-delay neural network to promoter annotation in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,11765852,10.1016/s0097-8485(01)00099-7,"Computational methods for automated genome annotation are critical to understanding and interpreting the bewildering mass of genomic sequence data presently being generated and released. A neural network model of the structural and compositional properties of a eukaryotic core promoter region has been developed and its application for analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster genome is presented. The model uses a time-delay architecture, a special case of a feed-forward neural network. The structure of this model allows for variable spacing between functional binding sites, which is known to play a key role in the transcription initiation process. Application of this model to a test set of core promoters not only gave better discrimination of potential promoter sites than previous statistical or neural network models, but also revealed indirectly subtle properties of the transcription initiation signal. When tested in the Adh region of 2.9 Mbases of the Drosophila genome, the neural network for promoter prediction (NNPP) program that incorporates the time-delay neural network model gives a recognition rate of 75% (69/92) with a false positive rate of 1/547 bases. The present work can be regarded as one of the first intensive studies that applies novel gene regulation technologies to the identification of the complex gene regulation sites in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster.",2001,"M G Reese, M G Reese"
Targeted gene disruption by CRISPR/xCas9 system in Drosophila melanogaster,32027059,10.1002/arch.21662,"Although the Cas9 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) is the most widely used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) variant in genome engineering experiments, it does have certain limitations. First, the stringent requirement for the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence limits the target DNA that can be manipulated using this method in insects. Second, its complementarity specifications are not very stringent, meaning that it can sometimes cause off-target effects at the target site. A recent study reported that an evolved SpCas9 variant, xCas9(3.7), with preference for various 5'-NG-3' PAM sequences not only has the broadest PAM compatibility but also has much greater DNA specificity and lower genome-wide off-target activity than SpCas9 in mammalian cells. Here we applied the CRISPR/xCas9 system to target the white gene in Drosophila melanogaster, testing the genome-editing efficiency of xCas9 at different PAM sites. On the GGG PAM site, xCas9 showed less activity than SpCas9. For the non-NGG PAM site TGA, xCas9 could produce DNA cleavage and indel-mediated disruption on the target gene. However, for other non-NGG PAM sites, xCas9 showed no activity. These findings show that the evolved Cas9 variant with broad PAM compatibility is functional in Drosophila to induce heritable gene alterations, increasing the targeting range for the applications of genome editing in insects.",2020,"Xu-Yang Ni, Zhen-Dong Zhou, Jia Huang, Xiaomu Qiao, Xu-Yang Ni, Zhen-Dong Zhou, Jia Huang, Xiaomu Qiao"
Transcriptome Analysis of Male Drosophila melanogaster Exposed to Ethylparaben Using Digital Gene Expression Profiling,28973488,10.1093/jisesa/iex050,"Ethylparaben (EP) has been shown to have estrogenic effects and can affect the normal development, longevity, and reproductive system of some animals. In this study, we investigated the effects of EP in male Drosophila melanogaster using transcriptome analysis or digital gene expression profiling. We then screened differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups (EP-treated and control group) of Drosophila, and performed clustering analysis, gene ontology (GO) function annotation, kyoto encyclopedia of gene and genomes metabolic pathway analysis. We found that EP enriched GO in three processes: cellular component, molecular function, and biological process. Consequently, we detected 13,959 genes and among them, 18 genes were identified to be significantly expressed between the EP-treated and control samples. Of these, seven genes were down-regulated, and eleven genes were up-regulated in EP-treated samples. Furthermore, four DEGs including two down-regulated genes (CG9465, CG9468) and two up-regulated genes (TotA, Sqz) were verified by real-time quantitative PCR.

Knockdown of Dynamitin in testes significantly decreased male fertility in Drosophila melanogaster,27742209,10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.10.007,"Dynamitin (Dmn) is a major component of dynactin, a multiprotein complex playing important roles in a variety of intracellular motile events. We previously found that Wolbachia bacterial infection resulted in a reduction of Dmn protein. As Wolbachia may modify sperm in male hosts, we speculate that Dmn may have a function in male fertility. Here we used nosGal4 to drive Dmn knock down in testes of Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the functions of Dmn in spermatogenesis. We found that knockdown of Dmn in testes dramatically decreased male fertility, overexpression of Dmn in Wolbachia-infected males significantly rescued male fertility, indicating an important role of Dmn in inducing male fertility defects following Wolbachia infection. Some scattered immature sperm with late canoe-shaped head distributed in the end of Dmn knockdown testis and only about half mature sperm were observed in the Dmn knockdown testis relative to those in the control. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) exhibited fused spermatids in cysts and abnormal mitochondrial derivatives. Immunofluorescence staining showed significantly less abundance of tubulin around the nucleus of spermatid and scattered F-actin cones to different extents in the individualization complex (IC) during spermiogenesis in Dmn knockdown testes, which may disrupt the nuclear condensation and sperm individualization. Since dynein-dynactin complex has been shown to mediate transport of many cellular components, including mRNAs and organelles, these results suggest that Dmn may play an important role in Drosophila spermiogenesis by affecting transport of many important cytoplasmic materials.",2016,"Chun-Hong Wu, Qiong Zong, An-Li Du, Wei Zhang, Han-Chao Yao, Xiao-Qiang Yu, Yu-Feng Wang, Chun-Hong Wu, Qiong Zong, An-Li Du, Wei Zhang, Han-Chao Yao, Xiao-Qiang Yu, Yu-Feng Wang"
Epigallocatechin gallate affects glucose metabolism and increases fitness and lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster,26375250,10.18632/oncotarget.5215,"In this study, we tested whether a standardized epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) rich green tea extract (comprising > 90% EGCG) affects fitness and lifespan as well as parameters of glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Following the application of the green tea extract a significant increase in the mean lifespan (+ 3.3 days) and the 50% survival (+ 4.3 days) as well as improved fitness was detected. These effects went along an increased expression of Spargel, the homolog of mammalian PGC1α, which has been reported to affect lifespan in flies. Intriguingly, in flies, treatment with the green tea extract decreased glucose concentrations, which were accompanied by an inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity. Computational docking analysis proved the potential of EGCG to dock into the substrate binding pocket of α-amylase and to a greater extent into α-glucosidase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EGCG downregulates insulin-like peptide 5 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, major regulators of glucose metabolism, as well as the Drosophila homolog of leptin, unpaired 2. We propose that a decrease in glucose metabolism in connection with an upregulated expression of Spargel contribute to the better fitness and the extended lifespan in EGCG-treated flies.",2015,"Anika E Wagner, Stefanie Piegholdt, Doerte Rabe, Nieves Baenas, Anke Schloesser, Manfred Eggersdorfer, Achim Stocker, Gerald Rimbach, Anika E Wagner, Stefanie Piegholdt, Doerte Rabe, Nieves Baenas, Anke Schloesser, Manfred Eggersdorfer, Achim Stocker, Gerald Rimbach"
Dissecting Motor Neuron Disease With Drosophila melanogaster,31031583,10.3389/fnins.2019.00331,"Motor Neuron Disease (MND) typically affects patients during the later stages of life, and thus, MND is having an increasingly devastating impact on diagnosed individuals, their families and society. The umbrella term MND refers to diseases which cause the progressive loss of upper and/or lower motor neurons and a subsequent decrease in motor ability such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The study of these diseases is complex and has recently involved the use of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, in the case of MND, it has been difficult to identify the complex genetics involved in subtypes, and functional investigation of new candidate disease genes is warranted. Drosophila is a powerful model for addressing these complex diseases. The UAS/Gal4/Gal80 system allows for the upregulation of Drosophila genes, the ""knockdown"" of genes and the ectopic expression of human genes or mutations in a tissue-specific manner; often resulting in Drosophila models which exhibit typical MND disease pathologies. These can then be further interrogated to identify disease-modifying genes or mutations and disease pathways. This review will discuss two common MNDs and the current Drosophila models which are being used to research their genetic basis and the different pathologies of MND.",2019,"Rachel Walters, John Manion, G Gregory Neely, Rachel Walters, John Manion, G Gregory Neely"

The ORF VP2 transcription was examined at the imago stage after crossing the obtained transgenic Drosophila with the driver line expressing the inducer protein (GAL4) under control of actin promoter (the ORF VP2 expression is induced in all tissues of the first-generation Drosophila). It was demonstrated that the greater part of transcribed foreign RNA was represented by three spliced variants in which RNA fragments either between nucleotides 137 and 353 or between nucleotides 609 and 1925 were excised; the third spliced variant was represented by RNA lacking both introns. Using the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique, the proportion of unspliced form relative to spliced variants of the analyzed RNA was assessed. It was shown that the ratio of unspliced form to the identified spliced variants of the analyzed RNA was approximately 1:6. It is suggested that splicing of viral RNA foreign to Drosophila can be a sort of defense mechanism preventing the large-scale production of the capsid protein, potentially hazardous to the host organism.",2016,"E N Kozlov, E U Martynova, N V Roshina, M V Karakozova, D V Mukha, E N Kozlov, E U Martynova, N V Roshina, M V Karakozova, D V Mukha"
Conservation of the protein composition and electron microscopy structure of Drosophila melanogaster and human spliceosomal complexes,18981222,10.1128/MCB.01415-08,"Comprehensive proteomics analyses of spliceosomal complexes are currently limited to those in humans, and thus, it is unclear to what extent the spliceosome's highly complex composition and compositional dynamics are conserved among metazoans.

Mass spectrometry revealed that their composition is highly similar to that of human B and C complexes. Nonetheless, a number of Drosophila-specific proteins were identified, suggesting that there may be novel factors contributing specifically to splicing in flies. Protein recruitment and release events during the B-to-C transition were also very similar in both organisms. Electron microscopy of Drosophila B complexes revealed a high degree of structural similarity with human B complexes, indicating that higher-order interactions are also largely conserved. A comparison of Drosophila spliceosomes formed on a short versus long intron revealed only small differences in protein composition but, nonetheless, clear structural differences under the electron microscope. Finally, the characterization of affinity-purified Drosophila mRNPs indicated that exon junction complex proteins are recruited in a splicing-dependent manner during C complex formation.

Sleep and wakefulness in Drosophila melanogaster,18591491,10.1196/annals.1417.017,"Sleep is present and tightly regulated in every vertebrate species in which it has been carefully investigated, but what sleep is for remains a mystery. Sleep is also present in invertebrates, and an extensive analysis in Drosophila melanogaster has shown that sleep in fruit flies shows most of the fundamental features that characterize sleep in mammals. In Drosophila, sleep consists of sustained periods of quiescence associated with an increased arousal threshold. Fly sleep is modulated by several of the same stimulants and hypnotics that affect mammalian sleep. Moreover, like in mammals, fly sleep shows remarkable interindividual variability. The expression of several genes involved in energy metabolism, synaptic plasticity, and the response to cellular stress varies in Drosophila between sleep and wakefulness, and the same occurs in rodents. Brain activity also changes in flies as a function of behavioral state. Furthermore, Drosophila sleep is tightly regulated in a circadian and homeostatic manner, and the homeostatic regulation is largely independent of the circadian regulation. After sleep deprivation, recovery sleep in flies is longer in duration and more consolidated, indicated by an increase in arousal threshold and fewer brief awakenings. Finally, sleep deprivation in flies impairs vigilance and performance. Because of the extensive similarities between flies and mammals, Drosophila is now being used as a promising model system for the genetic dissection of sleep. Over the last few years, mutagenesis screens have isolated several short sleeping mutants, a demonstration that single genes can have a powerful effect on a complex trait like sleep.",2008,"Chaira Cirelli, Daniel Bushey, Chaira Cirelli, Daniel Bushey"

The methods for DNA amplification and microarray manufacture are presented. Academic researchers can obtain the microarray from the Canadian Drosophila Microarray Centre. To evaluate the utility of these arrays, we compared the gene transcription profiles of two commonly used Drosophila cell lines. Analysis revealed that 5412 spot pairs gave signals consistently above the average background in Kc167 cells, whereas 5636 spot pairs met this criterion in SL2 cells. When the expression profiles of the cell lines were compared, 1437 genes displayed at least a 1.5-fold difference, and 170 genes had a threefold or greater difference between the two cell lines. In each case, with respect to Kc167 when compared with SL2 cells, the number of genes that were upregulated was nearly equal to the number of downregulated genes.

The similarity between Drosophila and mammals is not restricted to the manner in which they metabolize ethanol; behaviors elicited by ethanol exposure are also remarkably similar in these organisms. Flies show signs of acute intoxication, which range from locomotor stimulation at low doses to complete sedation at higher doses, they develop tolerance upon intermittent ethanol exposure, and they appear to like ethanol, showing preference for ethanol-containing media. Molecular genetic analysis of ethanol-induced behaviors in Drosophila, while still in its early stages, has already revealed some surprising parallels with mammals.

The maize b1 paramutation control region causes epigenetic silencing in Drosophila melanogaster,22729404,10.1007/s00438-012-0702-z,"Paramutation is an epigenetic process in which a combination of alleles in a heterozygous organism results in a meiotically stable change in expression of one of the alleles. The mechanisms underlying paramutation are being actively investigated, and examples have been described in both plants and mammals, suggesting that it may utilize epigenetic mechanisms that are widespread and evolutionarily conserved. Paramutation at the well-studied maize b1 locus requires a control region consisting of seven 853 bp tandem repeats. To study the conservation of the epigenetic mechanisms underlying seemingly unique epigenetic processes such as paramutation, we created transgenic Drosophila melanogaster carrying the maize b1 control region adjacent to the Drosophila white reporter gene. We show that the b1 tandem repeats cause silencing of the white reporter in Drosophila. A single copy of the tandem repeat sequence is sufficient to cause silencing, and silencing strength increases as the number of tandem repeats increases. Additionally, transgenic lines with the full seven tandem repeats demonstrate evidence of either pairing-sensitive silencing and silencing in trans, or epigenetic activation in trans. These trans-interactions are dependent on repeat number, similar to maize b1 paramutation. Also, as in maize, the tandem repeats are bidirectionally transcribed in Drosophila. These results indicate that the maize b1 tandem repeats function as an epigenetic silencer and mediate trans-interactions in Drosophila, and support the hypothesis that the mechanisms underlying such epigenetic processes are conserved.",2012,"Lori A McEachern, Vett K Lloyd, Lori A McEachern, Vett K Lloyd"
"G×G×E for lifespan in Drosophila: mitochondrial, nuclear, and dietary interactions that modify longevity",24832080,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004354,"Dietary restriction (DR) is the most consistent means of extending longevity in a wide range of organisms. A growing body of literature indicates that mitochondria play an important role in longevity extension by DR, but the impact of mitochondrial genotypes on the DR process have received little attention. Mitochondrial function requires proper integration of gene products from their own genomes (mtDNA) and the nuclear genome as well as the metabolic state of the cell, which is heavily influenced by diet. These three-way mitochondrial-nuclear-dietary interactions influence cellular and organismal functions that affect fitness, aging, and disease in nature. To examine these interactions in the context of longevity, we generated 18 ""mito-nuclear"" genotypes by placing mtDNA from strains of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans onto controlled nuclear backgrounds of D. melanogaster (Oregon-R, w1118, SIR2 overexpression and control) and quantified the lifespan of each mitonuclear genotype on five different sugar:yeast diets spanning a range of caloric and dietary restriction (CR and DR). Using mixed effect models to quantify main and interaction effects, we uncovered strong mitochondrial-diet, mitochondrial-nuclear, and nuclear-diet interaction effects, in addition to three-way interactions. Survival analyses demonstrate that interaction effects can be more important than individual genetic or dietary effects on longevity. Overexpression of SIR2 reduces lifespan variation among different mitochondrial genotypes and further dampens the response of lifespan to CR but not to DR, suggesting that response to these two diets involve different underlying mechanisms. Overall the results reveal that mitochondrial-nuclear genetic interactions play important roles in modulating Drosophila lifespan and these epistatic interactions are further modified by diet. More generally, these findings illustrate that gene-by-gene and gene-by-environment interactions are not simply modifiers of key factors affecting longevity, but these interactions themselves are the very factors that underlie important variation in this trait.",2014,"Chen-Tseh Zhu, Paul Ingelmo, David M Rand, Chen-Tseh Zhu, Paul Ingelmo, David M Rand"

A Defensive Kicking Behavior in Response to Mechanical Stimuli Mediated by Drosophila Wing Margin Bristles,27807168,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1416-16.2016,"Mechanosensation, one of the fastest sensory modalities, mediates diverse behaviors including those pertinent for survival. It is important to understand how mechanical stimuli trigger defensive behaviors. Here, we report that Drosophila melanogaster adult flies exhibit a kicking response against invading parasitic mites over their wing margin with ultrafast speed and high spatial precision. Mechanical stimuli that mimic the mites' movement evoke a similar kicking behavior. Further, we identified a TRPV channel, Nanchung, and a specific Nanchung-expressing neuron under each recurved bristle that forms an array along the wing margin as being essential sensory components for this behavior. Our electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that the mechanosensitivity of recurved bristles requires Nanchung and Nanchung-expressing neurons. Together, our results reveal a novel neural mechanism for innate defensive behavior through mechanosensation.
    

    
  


        Significance statement:
      
    

    
      We discovered a previously unknown function for recurved bristles on the Drosophila melanogaster wing. We found that when a mite (a parasitic pest for Drosophila) touches the wing margin, the fly initiates a swift and accurate kick to remove the mite. The fly head is dispensable for this behavior. Furthermore, we found that a TRPV channel, Nanchung, and a specific Nanchung-expressing neuron under each recurved bristle are essential for its mechanosensitivity and the kicking behavior. In addition, touching different regions of the wing margin elicits kicking directed precisely at the stimulated region. Our experiments suggest that recurved bristles allow the fly to sense the presence of objects by touch to initiate a defensive behavior (perhaps analogous to touch-evoked scratching; Akiyama et al., 2012).",2016,"Jiefu Li, Wei Zhang, Zhenhao Guo, Sophia Wu, Lily Yeh Jan, Yuh-Nung Jan, Jiefu Li, Wei Zhang, Zhenhao Guo, Sophia Wu, Lily Yeh Jan, Yuh-Nung Jan"

Partial DNA sequencing of these cDNAs demonstrated homology with the mammalian transporters, indicating these are ancient, evolutionarily conserved molecules. Although the Drosophila cDNAs had distinct restriction enzyme patterns, they recognized the same locus in Drosophila genomic DNA, suggesting that the multiple isoforms might arise via alternative splicing. Antibodies specific for the mammalian GABA transporters GAT 1, GAT 2 and GAT 3 recognized non-overlapping and developmentally distinct patterns of expression in Drosophila neuronal tissues. Treatment of larval instars with nipecotic acid, a generalized GABA reuptake inhibitor, revealed specific, dose-dependent alterations in behavior consistent with the presence of multiple transporter molecules with differing affinities for this drug. Synaptic current recordings revealed that nipecotic acid treated larvae have an increase in latency jitter of evoked quantal release, resulting in a broader average excitatory junctional current which was manifested in a broader EJP. These results imply that alterations in the development of the CNS occur if GABAergic neurotransmission is potentiated during development.

RNA encoding the polypeptide was detected in embryos only after the onset of muscle differentiation and was also abundant in adult thoracic muscle. The nucleotide sequence of cDNA generated from late embryonic RNA would be translated to yield a protein sequence with multiple regions of homology to vertebrate MLC2. (There are shorter regions of homology to vertebrate MLC1). Like a number of vertebrate muscle proteins, Drosophila MLC2 has an acetylated amino-terminus.",1987,"J Toffenetti, D Mischke, M L Pardue, J Toffenetti, D Mischke, M L Pardue"
Drosophila melanogaster Models of Metal-Related Human Diseases and Metal Toxicity,28684721,10.3390/ijms18071456,"Iron, copper and zinc are transition metals essential for life because they are required in a multitude of biological processes. Organisms have evolved to acquire metals from nutrition and to maintain adequate levels of each metal to avoid damaging effects associated with its deficiency, excess or misplacement. Interestingly, the main components of metal homeostatic pathways are conserved, with many orthologues of the human metal-related genes having been identified and characterized in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila has gained appreciation as a useful model for studying human diseases, including those caused by mutations in pathways controlling cellular metal homeostasis. Flies have many advantages in the laboratory, such as a short life cycle, easy handling and inexpensive maintenance. Furthermore, they can be raised in a large number. In addition, flies are greatly appreciated because they offer a considerable number of genetic tools to address some of the unresolved questions concerning disease pathology, which in turn could contribute to our understanding of the metal metabolism and homeostasis. This review recapitulates the metabolism of the principal transition metals, namely iron, zinc and copper, in Drosophila and the utility of this organism as an experimental model to explore the role of metal dyshomeostasis in different human diseases.

"The NMDA Receptor Promotes Sleep in the Fruit Fly, Drosophila melanogaster",26023770,10.1371/journal.pone.0128101,"Considerable evidence indicates that sleep is essential for learning and memory. Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a novel model for studying sleep. We previously found a short sleeper mutant, fumin (fmn), and identified its mutation in the dopamine transporter gene. We reported similarities in the molecular basis of sleep and arousal regulation between mammals and Drosophila. In aversive olfactory learning tasks, fmn mutants demonstrate defective memory retention, which suggests an association between sleep and memory. In an attempt to discover additional sleep related genes in Drosophila, we carried out a microarray analysis comparing mRNA expression in heads of fmn and control flies and found that 563 genes are differentially expressed. Next, using the pan-neuronal Gal4 driver elav-Gal4 and UAS-RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown individual genes, we performed a functional screen. We found that knockdown of the NMDA type glutamate receptor channel gene (Nmdar1) (also known as dNR1) reduced sleep. The NMDA receptor (NMDAR) plays an important role in learning and memory both in Drosophila and mammals. The application of the NMDAR antagonist, MK-801, reduced sleep in control flies, but not in fmn. These results suggest that NMDAR promotes sleep regulation in Drosophila.",2015,"Jun Tomita, Taro Ueno, Madoka Mitsuyoshi, Shoen Kume, Kazuhiko Kume, Jun Tomita, Taro Ueno, Madoka Mitsuyoshi, Shoen Kume, Kazuhiko Kume"
Proteomics of immune-challenged Drosophila melanogaster larvae hemolymph,15670757,10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.12.135,"In the last decade, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a promising invertebrate model for the investigation of innate immunity, in part because of its well characterised genetics. The information provided by the innumerous reports on Drosophila's immune response indicates that a large number of genes, in addition to the well-known antimicrobial peptide genes, are both up- and down-regulated upon immune challenge. Nevertheless, their contribution to fighting off infection has not been seriously addressed. With the application of recent advances in proteomics, the effects of an immune challenge in the overall modification of Drosophila 2-DE protein patterns were investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate hemolymph proteins differentially expressed between control and immunised larvae sets, which could be related solely to the Drosophila immune response. The list of immune-related protein spots included heat shock proteins and other proteins with chaperone properties, serine proteases, phenol oxidase, and Drosophila antioxidant system components, which accounted for 21% of the total of 70 identified proteins, metabolic enzymes implicated in pathways such as cellular respiration, fatty-acid oxidation, protein biosynthesis, and structural proteins.",2005,"Sofia de Morais Guedes, Rui Vitorino, Rosário Domingues, Kenneth Tomer, A J Ferrer Correia, Francisco Amado, Pedro Domingues, Sofia de Morais Guedes, Rui Vitorino, Rosário Domingues, Kenneth Tomer, A J Ferrer Correia, Francisco Amado, Pedro Domingues"
Isolation of the gene encoding the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GCN2 eIF-2alpha kinase,9649537,,"Genomic and cDNA clones homologous to the yeast GCN2 eIF-2alpha kinase (yGCN2) were isolated from Drosophila melanogaster. The identity of the Drosophila GCN2 (dGCN2) gene is supported by the unique combination of sequence encoding a protein kinase catalytic domain and a domain homologous to histidyl-tRNA synthetase and by the ability of dGCN2 to complement a deletion mutant of the yeast GCN2 gene. Complementation of Deltagcn2 in yeast by dGCN2 depends on the presence of the critical regulatory phosphorylation site (serine 51) of eIF-2alpha. dGCN2 is composed of 10 exons encoding a protein of 1589 amino acids. dGCN2 mRNA is expressed throughout Drosophila development and is particularly abundant at the earliest stages of embryogenesis. The dGCN2 gene was cytogenetically and physically mapped to the right arm of the third chromosome at 100C3 in STS Dm2514. The discovery of GCN2 in higher eukaryotes is somewhat unexpected given the marked differences between the amino acid biosynthetic pathways of yeast vs. Drosophila and other higher eukaryotes. Despite these differences, the presence of GCN2 in Drosophila suggests at least partial conservation from yeast to multicellular organisms of the mechanisms responding to amino acid deprivation.",1998,"D S Olsen, B Jordan, D Chen, R C Wek, D R Cavener, D S Olsen, B Jordan, D Chen, R C Wek, D R Cavener"
Introduction of the transposable element Minos into the germ line of Drosophila melanogaster,7568159,10.1073/pnas.92.21.9485,"A transposon based on the transposable element Minos from Drosophila hydei was introduced into the genome of Drosophila melanogaster using transformation mediated by the Minos transposase. The transposon carries a wild-type version of the white gene (w) of Drosophila inserted into the second exon of Minos. Transformation was obtained by injecting the transposon into preblastoderm embryos that were expressing transposase either from a Hsp70-Minos fusion inserted into the genome via P-element-mediated transformation or from a coinjected plasmid carrying the Hsp70-Minos fusion. Between 1% and 6% of the fertile injected individuals gave transformed progeny. Four of the insertions were cloned and the DNA sequences flanking the transposon ends were determined. The ""empty"" sites corresponding to three of the insertions were amplified from the recipient strain by PCR, cloned, and sequenced. In all cases, the transposon has inserted into a TA dinucleotide and has created the characteristic TA target site duplication. In the absence of transposase, the insertions were stable in the soma and the germ line. However, in the presence of the Hsp70-Minos gene the Minos-w transposon excises, resulting in mosaic eyes and germ-line reversion to the white phenotype. Minos could be utilized as an alternative to existing systems for transposon tagging and enhancer trapping in Drosophila; it might also be of use as a germ-line transformation vector for non-Drosophila insects.",1995,"T G Loukeris, B Arcà, I Livadaras, G Dialektaki, C Savakis, T G Loukeris, B Arcà, I Livadaras, G Dialektaki, C Savakis"

Whole Genome Sequences of 23 Species from the Drosophila montium Species Group (Diptera: Drosophilidae): A Resource for Testing Evolutionary Hypotheses,32220952,10.1534/g3.119.400959,"Large groups of species with well-defined phylogenies are excellent systems for testing evolutionary hypotheses. In this paper, we describe the creation of a comparative genomic resource consisting of 23 genomes from the species-rich Drosophila montium species group, 22 of which are presented here for the first time. The montium group is well-positioned for clade genomics. Within the montium clade, evolutionary distances are such that large numbers of sequences can be accurately aligned while also recovering strong signals of divergence; and the distance between the montium group and D. melanogaster is short enough so that orthologous sequence can be readily identified. All genomes were assembled from a single, small-insert library using MaSuRCA, before going through an extensive post-assembly pipeline. Estimated genome sizes within the montium group range from 155 Mb to 223 Mb (mean = 196 Mb). The absence of long-distance information during the assembly process resulted in fragmented assemblies, with the scaffold NG50s varying widely based on repeat content and sample heterozygosity (min = 18 kb, max = 390 kb, mean = 74 kb). The total scaffold length for most assemblies is also shorter than the estimated genome size, typically by 5-15%. However, subsequent analysis showed that our assemblies are highly complete. Despite large differences in contiguity, all assemblies contain at least 96% of known single-copy Dipteran genes (BUSCOs, n = 2,799). Similarly, by aligning our assemblies to the D. melanogaster genome and remapping coordinates for a large set of transcriptional enhancers (n = 3,457), we showed that each montium assembly contains orthologs for at least 91% of D. melanogaster enhancers. Importantly, the genic and enhancer contents of our assemblies are comparable to that of far more contiguous Drosophila assemblies. The alignment of our own D. serrata assembly to a previously published PacBio D. serrata assembly also showed that our longest scaffolds (up to 1 Mb) are free of large-scale misassemblies. Our genome assemblies are a valuable resource that can be used to further resolve the montium group phylogeny; study the evolution of protein-coding genes and cis-regulatory sequences; and determine the genetic basis of ecological and behavioral adaptations.",2020,"Michael J Bronski, Ciera C Martinez, Holli A Weld, Michael B Eisen, Michael J Bronski, Ciera C Martinez, Holli A Weld, Michael B Eisen"
Identification of fat-cell enhancer regions in Drosophila melanogaster,11841504,10.1046/j.0962-1075.2001.00310.x,"The insect fat body is a dynamic tissue involved in maintaining homeostasis. It functions not only in energy storage and intermediary metabolism but also in detoxification, communication and the immune response. Some of these functions are confined to distinct groups of fat body cells. In Drosophila melanogaster, discrete precursor-cell clusters populate the fat body [Hoshizaki, D.K., Blackburn, T., Price, C., Ghosh, M., Miles, K., Ragucci, M. and Sweis, R.

Whether these clusters populate defined morphological regions or whether they represent the precursors to functionally similar groups of fat-body cells has not been formally demonstrated. We have identified a 2.1 kb enhancer region from serpent (srp), a GATA transcription factor gene that is sufficient to induce fat-cell formation. This enhancer region drives expression in specific groups of precursor-cell clusters, which we show give rise to defined regions of the mature embryonic fat body. We present evidence that srp expression in different precursor fat cells is controlled by independent cis-acting regulatory regions, and we have tested the role of trans-acting factors in the specification of some of these cells. We suggest that the different positional cues regulating srp expression, and therefore general fat-cell specification, might also be involved in the functional specialization of fat cells. This may be a common mechanism in insects to explain the origin of biochemically distinct regions of the larval/adult fat body.",2002,"J M Miller, T Oligino, M Pazdera, A J López, D K Hoshizaki, J M Miller, T Oligino, M Pazdera, A J López, D K Hoshizaki"
Effect of methyl methanesulfonate on hsp70 expression and tissue damage in the third instar larvae of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster (hsp70-lacZ) Bg,22058658,10.2478/v10102-011-0025-7,"Methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) is an anti-carcinogenic drug and its toxicity has been reported in various experimental models. The hsp70s are a family of ubiquitously expressed heat shock proteins. In the recent years, hsp70 has been considered to be one of the candidate genes for predicting cytotoxicity against environmental chemicals. Nowadays emphasis is given to the use of alternatives to mammals in testing, research and education. The European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (EVCAM) has recommended the use of Drosophila as an alternative model for scientific studies. Almost all living organisms possess proteins with a similar structure to that of hsp70s. In the present study, the toxicity of MMS was evaluated by quantifying hsp70 expression and tissue damage in the third instar larvae of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster (hsp70-lacZ) Bg(9), at different doses and hours of exposure. We studied the effect of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0 µl/ml of MMS at 2, 4, 24 and 48 hours of exposure on hsp70 expression by using the soluble O-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) assay and on establishing the tissue damage by the Trypan blue exclusion assay in the third instar larvae of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster (hsp70-lacZ) Bg(9).

Effects of Exposure Time and Biological State on Acquisition and Accumulation of Erwinia amylovora by Drosophila melanogaster,31126937,10.1128/AEM.00726-19,"Fire blight, caused by the bacterium Erwinia amylovora, is a disease devastating the production of rosaceous crops, primarily apple and pear, with worldwide distribution. Fire blight begins in the spring when primary inoculum is produced as ooze, which consists of plant sap, E. amylovora, and exopolysaccharides. Ooze is believed to be transferred to healthy tissues by wind, rain, and insects. However, the mechanisms by which insects locate and transmit ooze are largely undocumented. The goals of this study were to investigate the biological factors affecting acquisition of E. amylovora from ooze by a model dipteran, Drosophila melanogaster, and to determine whether flies are able to mechanically transfer this bacterium after acquisition. We found that the percentage of positive flies increased as exposure time increased, but nutritional state, mating status, and sex did not significantly alter the number of positive individuals. Bacterial abundance was highly variable at all exposure times, suggesting that other biological factors play a role in acquisition. Nutritional state had a significant effect on E. amylovora abundance, and food-deprived flies had higher E. amylovora counts than satiated flies. We also demonstrated that D. melanogaster transmits E. amylovora to a selective medium surface and hypothesize that the same is possible for plant surfaces, where bacteria can persist until an opportunity to colonize the host arises. Collectively, these data suggest a more significant role for flies than previously thought in transmission of fire blight and contribute to a shift in our understanding of the E. amylovora disease cycle.IMPORTANCE A recent hypothesis proposed that dissemination of Erwinia amylovora from ooze by flies to native rosaceous trees was likely key to the life cycle of the bacterium during its evolution. Our study validates an important component of this hypothesis by showing that flies are capable of acquiring and transmitting this bacterium from ooze under various biotic conditions. Understanding how dipterans interact with ooze advances our current knowledge of its epidemiological function and provides strong evidence for an underappreciated role of flies in the disease cycle. These findings may be especially important as they pertain to shoot blight, because this stage of the disease is poorly understood and may involve a significant amount of insect activity. Broadly, this study underscores a need to consider the depth, breadth, and origin of interactions between flies and E. amylovora to better understand its epidemiology.",2019,"Matthew Boucher, Rowan Collins, Kerik Cox, Greg Loeb, Matthew Boucher, Rowan Collins, Kerik Cox, Greg Loeb"

Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility is associated with decreased Hira expression in male Drosophila,21559343,10.1371/journal.pone.0019512,"Background:
      
    

    
      Wolbachia are obligate endosymbiotic bacteria that infect numerous species of arthropods and nematodes. Wolbachia can induce several reproductive phenotypes in their insect hosts including feminization, male-killing, parthenogenesis and cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). CI is the most common phenotype and occurs when Wolbachia-infected males mate with uninfected females resulting in no or very low numbers of viable offspring. However, matings between males and females infected with the same strain of Wolbachia result in viable progeny. Despite substantial scientific effort, the molecular mechanisms underlying CI are currently unknown.
    

    
  


        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      Gene expression studies were undertaken in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans which display differential levels of CI using quantitative RT-PCR. We show that Hira expression is correlated with the induction of CI and occurs in a sex-specific manner. Hira expression is significantly lower in males which induce strong CI when compared to males inducing no CI or Wolbachia-uninfected males. A reduction in Hira expression is also observed in 1-day-old males that induce stronger CI compared to 5-day-old males that induce weak or no CI. In addition, Hira mutated D. melanogaster males mated to uninfected females result in significantly decreased hatch rates comparing with uninfected crosses. Interestingly, wMel-infected females may rescue the hatch rates. An obvious CI phenotype with chromatin bridges are observed in the early embryo resulting from Hira mutant fertilization, which strongly mimics the defects associated with CI.
    

    
  


        Conclusions/significance:
      
    

    
      Our results suggest Wolbachia-induced CI in Drosophila occurs due to a reduction in Hira expression in Wolbachia-infected males leading to detrimental effects on sperm fertility resulting in embryo lethality. These results may help determine the underlying mechanism of CI and provide further insight in to the important role Hira plays in the interaction of Wolbachia and its insect host.",2011,"Ya Zheng, Pan-Pan Ren, Jia-Lin Wang, Yu-Feng Wang, Ya Zheng, Pan-Pan Ren, Jia-Lin Wang, Yu-Feng Wang"
Ageing and genetic background influence anaesthetic effects in a D. melanogaster model of blunt trauma with brain injury †,32466842,10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.029,"Background:
      
    

    
      General anaesthetics interact with the pathophysiological mechanisms of traumatic brain injury (TBI). We used a Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) model to test the hypothesis that ageing and genetic background modulate the effect of anaesthetics and hyperoxia on TBI-induced mortality in the context of blunt trauma.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      We exposed flies to isoflurane or sevoflurane under normoxic or hyperoxic conditions and TBI, and subsequently quantified the effect on mortality 24 h after injury. To determine the effect of age on anaesthetic-induced mortality, we analysed flies at 1-8 and 43-50 days old. To determine the effect of genetic background, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis on a collection of young inbred, fully sequenced lines.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Exposure to anaesthetics and hyperoxia differentially affected mortality in young and old flies. Pre-exposure of young but not old flies to anaesthetics reduced mortality. Post-exposure selectively increased mortality. For old but not young flies, hyperoxia enhanced the effect on mortality of post-exposure to isoflurane but not to sevoflurane. Post-exposure to isoflurane in hyperoxia increased the mortality of young fly lines in the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel collection to different extents. GWAS analysis of these data identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in cell water regulation and oxygen sensing as being associated with the post-exposure effect on mortality.

In Drosophila melanogaster, several hydrocarbons including the male sex pheromone 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) and female-specific 7,11-dienes influence courtship behavior and can function as cues for short-term memory associated with the mating experience. Behavioral and physiological studies suggest that other unidentified chemical communication cues are likely to exist. To more fully characterize the hydrocarbon profile of the D. melanogaster cuticle, we applied direct ultraviolet laser desorption/ionization orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UV-LDI-o-TOF MS) and analyzed the surface of intact fruit flies at a spatial resolution of approximately 200 mum.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We report the chemical and spatial characterization of 28 species of cuticular hydrocarbons, including a new major class of oxygen-containing compounds. Via UV-LDI MS, pheromones previously shown to be expressed exclusively by one sex, e.g., cVA, 7,11-heptacosadiene, and 7,11-nonacosadiene, appear to be found on both male and female flies. In males, cVA colocalizes at the tip of the ejaculatory bulb with a second acetylated hydrocarbon named CH503. We describe the chemical structure of CH503 as 3-O-acetyl-1,3-dihydroxy-octacosa-11,19-diene and demonstrate a behavioral role for this compound as a long-lived inhibitor of male courtship. Like cVA, CH503 is transferred from males to females during mating. Unlike cVA, CH503 remains on the surface of females for at least 10 days.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Oxygenated hydrocarbons comprise a major previously undescribed class of compounds on the Drosophila cuticular surface. A newly discovered long-chain acetate, CH503, serves as a mediator of courtship-related chemical communication.",2009,"Joanne Y Yew, Klaus Dreisewerd, Heinrich Luftmann, Johannes Müthing, Gottfried Pohlentz, Edward A Kravitz, Joanne Y Yew, Klaus Dreisewerd, Heinrich Luftmann, Johannes Müthing, Gottfried Pohlentz, Edward A Kravitz"
A compact gene cluster in Drosophila: the unrelated Cs gene is compressed between duplicated amd and Ddc,10231575,10.1016/s0378-1119(99)00096-7,"Cs, a gene with unknown function, and amd and Ddc, which encode decarboxylases, are among the most closely spaced genes in D. melanogaster. Untranslated 3' ends of the convergently transcribed genes Cs and Ddc are known to overlap by 88bp. A number of questions arise about the organization of this tightly-packed gene region and about the evolution and function of the Cs gene. We have now investigated this three-gene cluster in Scaptodrosophila lebanonensis (which diverged from D. melanogaster 60-65 MYA), as well as in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Gene order and direction of transcription is the same in all three species. The Cs gene codes, in Scaptodrosophila, for a polypeptide of 544 amino acids; in D. melanogaster, it consists of 504 amino acids, which is twice as long as previously suggested, which makes the gene density even more spectacular. The Cs sequences exhibit higher number of non-synonymous substitutions between species, higher ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, and lower codon usage bias than other genes, suggesting that Cs is less functionally constrained than the other genes. This is consistent with the failure of inducing phenotypic mutations in D. melanogaster. The function of Cs remains to be identified, but a high degree of similarity indicates that it is homologous to genes coding for a corticosteroid-binding protein in yeast and a polyamine oxidase in maize.",1999,"A Tatarenkov, A G Sáez, F J Ayala, A Tatarenkov, A G Sáez, F J Ayala"

Dm5-HT 2B: Pharmacological Characterization of the Fifth Serotonin Receptor Subtype of Drosophila melanogaster,28553207,10.3389/fnsys.2017.00028,"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is an important regulator of physiological and behavioral processes in both protostomes (e.g., insects) and deuterostomes (e.g., mammals). In insects, serotonin has been found to modulate the heart rate and to control secretory processes, development, circadian rhythms, aggressive behavior, as well as to contribute to learning and memory. Serotonin exerts its activity by binding to and activating specific membrane receptors. The clear majority of these receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. In Drosophila melanogaster, a total of five genes have been identified coding for 5-HT receptors. From this family of proteins, four have been pharmacologically examined in greater detail, so far. While Dm5-HT1A, Dm5-HT1B, and Dm5-HT7 couple to cAMP signaling cascades, the Dm5-HT2A receptor leads to Ca2+ signaling in an inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent manner. Based on sequence similarity to homologous genes in other insects, a fifth D. melanogaster gene was uncovered coding for a Dm5-HT2B receptor. Knowledge about this receptor's pharmacological properties is very limited. This is quite surprising because Dm5-HT2B has been attributed to distinct physiological functions based on genetic interference with its gene expression. Mutations were described reducing the response of the larval heart to 5-HT, and specific knockdown of Dm5-HT2B mRNA in hemocytes resulted in a higher susceptibility of the flies to bacterial infection. To gain deeper understanding of Dm5-HT2B's pharmacology, we evaluated the receptor's response to a series of established 5-HT receptor agonists and antagonists in a functional cell-based assay. Metoclopramide and mianserin were identified as two potent antagonists that may allow pharmacological interference with Dm5-HT2B signaling in vitro and in vivo.",2017,"Wolfgang Blenau, Stöppler Daniel, Sabine Balfanz, Markus Thamm, Arnd Baumann, Wolfgang Blenau, Stöppler Daniel, Sabine Balfanz, Markus Thamm, Arnd Baumann"
Multiple roles of the Y chromosome in the biology of Drosophila melanogaster,20842320,10.1100/tsw.2010.168,"The X and Y chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster were the first examples of chromosomes associated with genetic information. Thanks to the serendipitous discovery of a male with white eyes in 1910, T.H. Morgan was able to associate the X chromosome of the fruit fly with a phenotypic character (the eye color) for the first time. A few years later, his student, C.B. Bridges, demonstrated that X0 males, although phenotypically normal, are completely sterile. This means that the X chromosome, like the autosomes, harbors genes that control several phenotypic traits, while the Y chromosome is important for male fertility only. Notwithstanding its long history--almost 100 years in terms of genetic studies--most of the features of the Y chromosome are still a mystery. This is due to the intrinsic nature of this genetic element, namely, (1) its molecular composition (mainly transposable elements and satellite DNA), (2) its genetic inertia (lack of recombination due to its heterochromatic nature), (3) the absence of homology with the X (with the only exception of the nucleolar organizer), (4) the lack of visible phenotypes when it is missing (indeed, except for their sterility, X0 flies are normal males), and (5) its low density as for protein-coding sequences (to date, only 13 genes out of approximately 14,000 have been mapped on this chromosome in D. melanogaster, i.e., ~0.1% of the total). Nonetheless, a more accurate analysis reveals that this chromosome can influence several complex phenotypes: (1) it has a role in the fertility of both sexes and viability of males when over-represented; (2) it can unbalance the intracellular nucleotide pool; (3) it can interfere with the gene expression either by recruiting proteins involved in chromatin remodeling (PEV) or, to a higher extent, by influencing the expression of up to 1,000 different genes, probably by changing the availability of transcription factors; (4) it plays a major role (up to 50%) in the resistance to heat-induced male sterility; (5) it affects the behavior; and (6) it plays a role in genetic imprinting. In the present paper, all these Y-related phenotypes are described and a potential similarity with the human Y chromosome is drawn.",2010,"Roberto Piergentili, Roberto Piergentili"
Molecular analysis of an allozyme cline: alcohol dehydrogenase in Drosophila melanogaster on the east coast of North America,8102342,,"Clines may either be selectively maintained or be the by-product of nonadaptive processes related to population structure and history. Drosophila melanogaster populations on the east coast of North America show a latitudinal cline in the frequencies of two common electrophoretically distinguishable alleles at the alcohol dehydrogenase locus (Adh), designated Adh-S and Adh-F. This cline may either be adaptive or an artifact of a possible recent dual founding of North American D. melanogaster populations in which frequencies of Adh alleles differed between founder populations. By means of a high resolution restriction-mapping technique, we studied the distribution of 113 haplotypes derived from 44 polymorphic DNA markers within the Adh region in 1533 individuals from 25 populations throughout the cline. We found significant clinal differentiation at the polymorphism determining the mobility-difference causing amino acid replacement between Adh-F and Adh-S alleles. Hitchhiking was limited, despite extensive linkage disequilibrium, and other sites did not vary clinally. Such a pattern of differentiation implies that selection is responsible for the cline. To investigate whether selection acts only on the Adh-F/S site, we performed a ""selective equivalence"" test under the assumption that all variability within the specified allelic class is selectively neutral. This revealed selective equivalence among Adh-S-bearing haplotypes, whose frequencies showed no differentiation throughout the cline, implying high levels of frequency-homogenizing gene flow. Geographical heterogeneity among Adh-F-bearing haplotypes implied the action of selection on one or more additional variants in linkage disequilibrium with Adh-F. In a further study of a subset of the data (n = 1076 from 18 populations), we found a combined insertion/deletion polymorphism, designated delta 1, located in the 5' adult intron and in linkage disequilibrium with Adh-F, to show more marked clinal variation than Adh-F/S. Although the unequivocal identification of the precise target(s) of selection requires further study, we suggest that clinal selection may be acting epistatically on the Adh-F/S and delta 1 polymorphisms.",1993,"A Berry, M Kreitman, A Berry, M Kreitman"

We demonstrate persistent neuronal activity of aSP13 neurons and show that it transiently potentiates synaptic transmission from MBγ>M6 neurons. M6 neurons in turn provide input to aSP13 neurons, prolonging potentiation of MBγ>M6 synapses over time periods that match short-term memory. These data support a model in which persistent aSP13 activity within a recurrent circuit lays the foundation for a short-term memory.",2018,"Xiaoliang Zhao, Daniela Lenek, Ugur Dag, Barry J Dickson, Krystyna Keleman, Xiaoliang Zhao, Daniela Lenek, Ugur Dag, Barry J Dickson, Krystyna Keleman"

A review of neurohormone GPCRs present in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster and the honey bee Apis mellifera,17070981,10.1016/j.pneurobio.2006.07.005,"G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) genes are large gene families in every animal, sometimes making up to 1-2% of the animal's genome. Of all insect GPCRs, the neurohormone (neuropeptide, protein hormone, biogenic amine) GPCRs are especially important, because they, together with their ligands, occupy a high hierarchic position in the physiology of insects and steer crucial processes such as development, reproduction, and behavior. In this paper, we give a review of our current knowledge on Drosophila melanogaster GPCRs and use this information to annotate the neurohormone GPCR genes present in the recently sequenced genome from the honey bee Apis mellifera. We found 35 neuropeptide receptor genes in the honey bee (44 in Drosophila) and two genes, coding for leucine-rich repeats-containing protein hormone GPCRs (4 in Drosophila). In addition, the honey bee has 19 biogenic amine receptor genes (21 in Drosophila). The larger numbers of neurohormone receptors in Drosophila are probably due to gene duplications that occurred during recent evolution of the fly. Our analyses also yielded the likely ligands for 40 of the 56 honey bee neurohormone GPCRs identified in this study. In addition, we made some interesting observations on neurohormone GPCR evolution and the evolution and co-evolution of their ligands. For neuropeptide and protein hormone GPCRs, there appears to be a general co-evolution between receptors and their ligands. This is in contrast to biogenic amine GPCRs, where evolutionarily unrelated GPCRs often bind to the same biogenic amine, suggesting frequent ligand exchanges (""ligand hops"") during GPCR evolution.",2006,"Frank Hauser, Giuseppe Cazzamali, Michael Williamson, Wolfgang Blenau, Cornelis J P Grimmelikhuijzen, Frank Hauser, Giuseppe Cazzamali, Michael Williamson, Wolfgang Blenau, Cornelis J P Grimmelikhuijzen"
Effects of microbial floras on the distributions of five domestic Drosophila species across fruit resources,28312184,10.1007/BF00378745,"The distributions of five Drosophila species and four components of the microflora have been compared across a total of 48 traps baited with four different fruit and vegetable substrates in two domestic compost heaps in Canberra (Australia). Large and consistent differences are found, both among the Drosophila and among the microbial classes, in their distributions across traps baited with different substrates. Moreover the distribution of each Drosophila species shows a unique set of strong associations with the microbial distributions. Thus the distributions of both D. simulans and D. melanogaster are found to be strongly negatively correlated with the abundance of bacteria while D. simulans is also strongly positively correlated with the titre of fermenter yeasts. D. immigrans is strongly positively correlated both with bacteria and with non-fermenter yeasts. D. hydei is positively correlated with nonfermentery yeasts and D. busckii is negatively correlated with fermenter yeasts. Moulds are the only microbial class not consistently associated with the distribution of any of the Drosophila species. The correlations with the other microbial classes are sufficient to explain the majority of the abundance differences of the Drosophila species among the trap types. It is therefore proposed that the clear partitioning of the fruit resources by the Drosophila is due to their differing primary interactions with the microflora.",1989,"J G Oakeshott, D C Vacek, P R Anderson, J G Oakeshott, D C Vacek, P R Anderson"
Ionotropic Receptor-dependent moist and dry cells control hygrosensation in Drosophila,28621663,10.7554/eLife.26654,"Insects use hygrosensation (humidity sensing) to avoid desiccation and, in vectors such as mosquitoes, to locate vertebrate hosts. Sensory neurons activated by either dry or moist air ('dry cells' and 'moist cells') have been described in many insects, but their behavioral roles and the molecular basis of their hygrosensitivity remain unclear. We recently reported that Drosophila hygrosensation relies on three Ionotropic Receptors (IRs) required for dry cell function: IR25a, IR93a and IR40a (Knecht et al., 2016). Here, we discover Drosophila moist cells and show that they require IR25a and IR93a together with IR68a, a conserved, but orphan IR. Both IR68a- and IR40a-dependent pathways drive hygrosensory behavior: each is important for dry-seeking by hydrated flies and together they underlie moist-seeking by dehydrated flies.

Comparative analysis of Corazonin-encoding genes (Crz's) in Drosophila species and functional insights into Crz-expressing neurons,15669053,10.1002/cne.20419,"To gain insight into regulatory mechanisms of tissue-specific Corazonin (Crz) gene expression and its functions in Drosophila, we cloned the Crz genes from four Drosophila species (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. erecta, and D. virilis) and performed comparative analyses of Crz gene sequences and expression patterns using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Although Crz gene sequences showed a great deal of diversity, its expression patterns in the CNS were highly conserved in the Drosophila species examined here. In D. melanogaster larva, Crz expression was found in four pairs of neurons per cerebral lobe and in eight pairs of bilateral neurons in the ventral nerve cord; in adult, the number of Crz-producing neurons increased to 6-8 in the pars lateralis of each brain lobe, whereas neurons in the ventral nerve cord were no longer detectable. Crz transcripts were also found in the optic lobes; however, these mRNAs do not seem to be translated. Such adult-like Crz expression patterns were established within 48 hours after pupation. Somata of Crz-neurons in the pars lateralis are located in the vicinity of terminals emanating from PDF-containing pacemaking neurons, indicating a functional connection between the two peptidergic nervous systems. A subset of Crz neurons coexpressed the period clock gene; however, normal Crz transcription was unaffected by central clockworks. Two pairs of ectopic Crz cells were detected in the adult brains of behaviorally arrhythmic Clock(Jrk) or cycle(02) mutants, suggesting that CLOCK and CYCLE proteins negatively regulate Crz transcription in a cell-specific manner.",2005,"Youn J Choi, Gyunghee Lee, Jeffrey C Hall, Jae H Park, Youn J Choi, Gyunghee Lee, Jeffrey C Hall, Jae H Park"
Evaluation of the genotoxic properties of nickel oxide nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo,30442345,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2018.06.003,"Nickel-based nanoparticles (NPs) are new products with an increasing number of industrial applications that were developed in recent years. NiO NPs are present in several nanotechnological industrial products, and the characterization of their genotoxic potential is essential. The present study assessed the genotoxicity of NiO NPs in vivo and in vitro using the somatic mutation and recombination test in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster (SMART), the cytokinesis - block micronucleus assay (CBMN), and the comet assay in a V79 cell line. The NiO NPs used in this study were about 30 nm in mean size. Larvae of Drosophila melanogaster were exposed to 5 mL of five different concentrations (1.31, 2.62, 5.25, 10.5, and 21 mg/mL) of NiO NPs. In turn, V79 cells were treated with a concentration range of 15-2000 μg/mL NiO NPs. The SMART showed that all concentrations of NiO NPs are genotoxic to the standart (ST) cross when compared to the negative control. On the other hand, only the highest concentration (21 mg/mL) was genotoxic to the HB cross. Somatic recombination was the preferential mechanism lesions were induced in D. melanogaster. The results show that NiO NPs were mutagenic to V79 cells as assessed by the CBMN assay. Significant differences in the frequencies of micronuclei (MN) were observed using the highest NiO NP concentrations (250 and 500 μg/mL) in the 4- and 24-h treatments, but when 125 μg/mL NiO NPs was used, such difference was observed only in the 4-h exposure time. The comet assay revealed that 62, 125, 250 and 500 μg/mL NiO NPs induced a significant increase in DNA damage.

In addition, VCM and VCD may be found as by-products of VCH oxidation in the environment. Recently, we reported the involvement of oxidative stress in the toxicity of VCH in Drosophila melanogaster. However, it was not possible to determine the individual contributions of VCM and VCD in VCH toxicity. Hence, we investigated the toxicity of VCM and VCD (10-1000 µM) in flies after 5 days of exposure via the diet. Our results indicated impairments in climbing behaviour and disruptions in antioxidant balance and redox status evidenced by an increase in DCFH oxidation, decreases in total thiol content and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity in the flies exposed to VCM and VCD (p<0.05). These effects were accompanied by disruptions in the transcription of the genes encoding the proteins superoxide dismutase (SOD1), kelch-like erythroid-derived cap-n-collar (CNC) homology (ECH)-associated protein 1 (Keap-1), mitogen activated protein kinase 2 (MAPK-2), catalase, Cyp18a1, JAFRAC 1 (thioredoxin peroxidase 1) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR-1) (p<0.05). VCM and VCD inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (δ-ALA D) activities in the flies (p<0.05). Indeed, here, we demonstrated that different target enzymes and genes were modified by the electrophiles VCM and VCD in the flies.

Effect of prolonged coldness on survival and fertility of Drosophila melanogaster,24632815,10.1371/journal.pone.0092228,"The laboratory fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is used widely in biological research, but the requirement to maintain stocks with a roughly biweekly generation time imposes substantial burdens of labor, potential cross-contamination and mutation accumulation. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of prolonged cold stress or milder cooling on survivorship and fertility. The hypothesis was that cold storage would result in postponement of reproduction and a longer generation time. Flies of several genotypes were maintained continuously at 4-11 °C; recovery rates and subsequent yields of adult progeny were recorded. Adults and pupae of a relatively long-lived y w lineage were more resistant to severe cold stress than embryos and larvae. Adults exhibited minimal mortality up to at least 5 d at 4 °C, 20 d at 8 °C and 12 weeks at 11 °C. Reproduction did not occur at these temperatures, but progeny were obtained after recovery at 25 °C. At all temperatures, chilling caused a rapid, severe and progressive decrease in fertility during the first 2 d of recovery. The impact on fertility during the subsequent 2-4 d was much milder and it occurred only after prolonged incubation at low temperatures. The total reproductive output during the first 6 d of recovery was sufficient to replace the parental population after 12 weeks at 11 °C. Food spoilage had an unexpectedly low impact on survivorship and fertility, and the reproductive output of F1 progeny was not affected by storing parental flies at 11 °C for 8-10 weeks. In the case of w1118 flies, replacement of the parents within 6 d of recovery was possible for up to 60 d at 11 °C. Among less fertile genotypes, replacement of the parents was possible within 18 d after 4-10 weeks at 11 °C. These results show that the 2-week maintenance interval of stocks of D. melanogaster can be extended 3-7 fold, at least for 1 generation, by storing adult flies at 11 °C.",2014,"Robin J Mockett, Yuri Matsumoto, Robin J Mockett, Yuri Matsumoto"
"Patterns of naturally occurring restriction map variation, dopa decarboxylase activity variation and linkage disequilibrium in the Ddc gene region of Drosophila melanogaster",1358752,,"Forty-six second-chromosome lines of Drosophila melanogaster isolated from five natural populations were surveyed for restriction map variation in a 65-kb region surrounding the gene (Ddc) encoding dopa decarboxylase (DDC). Sixty-nine restriction sites were scored, 13 of which were polymorphic. Average heterozygosity per nucleotide was estimated to be 0.005. Eight large (0.7-5.0 kb) inserts, two small inserts (100 and 200 bp) and three small deletions (100-300 bp) were also observed across the 65-kb region. We see no evidence for a reduction in either nucleotide heterozygosity or insertion/deletion variation in the central 26-kb segment containing Ddc and a dense cluster of lethal complementation groups and transcripts (greater than or equal to 9 genes) compared to that seen in the adjacent regions (totaling 39 kb) in which only a single gene and transcript has been detected, or to that observed for other gene regions in D. melanogaster. The distribution of restriction site variation shows no significant departure from that expected under an equilibrium neutral model. However insertions and deletions show a significant departure from neutrality in that they are too rare in frequency, consistent with them being deleterious on average. Significant linkage disequilibrium among variants exists across much of the 65-kb region. Lower regional rates of recombination combined with the influence of polymorphic chromosomal inversions, rather than epistatic selection among genes in the dense cluster, probably are sufficient explanations for the creation and/or maintenance of the linkage disequilibrium observed in the Ddc region. We have also assayed adult DDC enzyme activity in these same lines. Twofold variation in activity among lines is observed within our sample. Significant associations are observed between level of DDC enzyme activity and restriction map variants. Surprisingly, one line with a 5.0-kb insert within an intron and one line with a 1.5-kb insert near the 5' end of Ddc each show normal adult DDC activities.",1992,"C F Aquadro, R M Jennings Jr, M M Bland, C C Laurie, C H Langley, C F Aquadro, R M Jennings Jr, M M Bland, C C Laurie, C H Langley"
Characterization of a Drosophila melanogaster gene similar to the mammalian genes encoding the tyrosine/tryptophan hydroxylase activator and protein kinase C inhibitor proteins,1349290,10.1016/0378-1119(92)90394-5,"A cloned 1.3-kb cDNA that hybridizes to genomic clone 549, containing genes predominantly expressed in the head of Drosophila melanogaster, was characterized. DNA sequencing showed that the cDNA-encoded protein is similar to a family of mammalian proteins, called 14-3-3, which activate tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrOHase) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TrpOHase), the two key enzymes regulating biosynthesis of biogenic monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, in the brain. The putative D. melanogaster 14-3-3 protein (D14-3-3) shares 72.4, 74.3 and 78.3% amino acid (aa) sequence identity and 83.5, 87.7 and 85.9% aa sequence similarity with the beta, gamma and eta forms of bovine 14-3-3 protein, respectively. A lower (71%), but significant level of aa sequence identity was also found between D14-3-3 and sheep brain protein kinase C inhibitor protein (KCIP). The D14-3-3 gene expresses 1.0-, 1.9- and 2.9-kb mRNAs which show differential expression patterns. While the 2.9-kb mRNA is expressed only in the head, the other two mRNAs are found both in the head and body. Compared to the 1.9- and 2.9-kb mRNAs, the 1.0-kb mRNA is more abundant in the ovary and is probably maternally inherited. The 1.9-kb mRNA is the most predominant species in the embryos and its level peaks between 6-15 h of embryogenesis. The D14-3-3 gene is predominantly expressed in the ventral nerve cord of the embryo, and in the neural tissues of the head.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1992,"K D Swanson, R Ganguly, K D Swanson, R Ganguly"
The sex-linked recessive lethal test for mutagenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. A report of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Gene-Tox Program,6413857,10.1016/0165-1110(83)90025-8,"The test for sex-linked recessive lethals (SLRL) in Drosophila melanogaster has been used to detect induced mutations since 1927. The advantage of the test for both screening and hazard evaluation is its objectivity in testing for transmissible mutations in the germ cells of a eukaryote. Statistical criteria for both positive and negative mutagenicity at the highest concentration tested under a particular exposure condition were developed by the Work Group, and a recommended protocol for future testing was agreed upon. For 421 compounds there were sufficient data available in the literature for analysis; 198 compounds were found to be positive and 46 negative at the highest concentration tested. Most experiments had been done for objectives of pure research rather than for deliberately screening for mutagenicity, although many of the 421 chemicals were selected for testing because of suspected mutagenicity. Therefore, the statement of 198 positive and 46 negative should not be taken as an example of the proportion of mutagens in the environment. In three sets of experiments with D. melanogaster that were done specifically for screening, one involving 40 compounds for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the others involving 13 for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), only 6 mutagens were discovered. After completion of the classification of compounds according to their response in the SLRL test, the compounds were classified as to their carcinogenic response according to the list of Griesemer and Cueto (1980). There were 62 compounds that could be classified as positive or negative for both carcinogenesis and mutagenesis. Of the 62 compounds, there was agreement between the carcinogenesis and mutagenesis classification in 56 (50 positive and 6 negative), or 90% would have been correctly classified as to carcinogenesis from only the SLRL test. Because of inadequate sample size, 177 compounds could not be classified as positive or negative according to the statistical criteria established by the Work Group. This large number of inadequately tested compounds reflects the fact that many of the experiments were not done for screening. Further work is needed on the compounds with inadequate sample size.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1983,"W R Lee, S Abrahamson, R Valencia, E S von Halle, F E Würgler, S Zimmering, W R Lee, S Abrahamson, R Valencia, E S von Halle, F E Würgler, S Zimmering"
The genetic structure of natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster XIII.

M. Johnson, unpublished; position determined by the present authors to be 2-74.5) were assayed for 617 second chromosomes, and esterase-C (Est-C) and octanol dehydrogenase (Odh) were assayed for 526 third chromosomes. In addition, two polymorphic inversions in the second chromosomes [In(2L)t and In(2R)NS] were examined, and the following findings were obtained: (1) No linkage disequilibrium between isozyme genes was detected. Significant linkage disequilibria were found only between the polymorphic inversions and isozyme genes [In(2L)t vs. Adh, and In(2R)NS vs. Hex-C]. Significant disequilibrium was not detected between In(2L)t and alphaGpdh-1, which is included in the inversion, but a tendency toward disequilibrium was consistently found from 1968 to 1974. The frequency of two-strand double crossovers within inversion In(2L)t involving a single crossover on each side of alphaGpdh-1 was estimated to be 0.00022. Thus, the consistent but not significant linkage disequilibrium between the two factors can be explained by recombination after the inversion occurred. (2) Previously existing linkage disequilibrium between Adh and In(2R)NS (the distance is about 30 cM, but the effective recombination value is about 1.75%) was found to have disappeared. (3) No higher-order linkage disequilibrium was detected. (4) Linkage disequilibrium between Odh and Est-C (the distance of which was estimated to be 0.0058 +/- 0.002) could not be detected (chi(2) (df=1) = 0.9).-From the above results, it was concluded that linkage disequilibria among isozyme genes are very rare in D. melanogaster, so that the Franklin-Lewontin model (Franklin and Lewontin 1970) is not applicable to these genes. The linkage disequilibria between some isozyme genes and polymorphic inversions may be explained by founder effect.",1977,"T Mukai, R A Voelker, T Mukai, R A Voelker"

Natural genetic variation in the gene RNA-binding Fox protein 1 (Rbfox1) correlated with low phagocytic capacity in hemocytes, pointing to Rbfox1 as a candidate regulator of phagocytosis. Loss of Rbfox1 resulted in increased expression of the Ig superfamily member Down syndrome adhesion molecule 4 (Dscam4). Silencing of Dscam4 in Rbfox1-depleted blood cells rescued the fly's cellular immune response to S. aureus, indicating that downregulation of Dscam4 by Rbfox1 is critical for S. aureus phagocytosis in Drosophila To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate a link between Rbfox1, Dscam4, and host defense against S. aureus.",2018,"Ashley E Nazario-Toole, Javier Robalino, Kwame Okrah, Hector Corrada-Bravo, Stephen M Mount, Louisa P Wu, Ashley E Nazario-Toole, Javier Robalino, Kwame Okrah, Hector Corrada-Bravo, Stephen M Mount, Louisa P Wu"
Effect of intracellular Wolbachia on interspecific crosses between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,19731208,10.4238/vol8-3gmr595,"Wolbachia are bacteria that live inside the cells of a large number of invertebrate hosts and are transmitted from infected females to their offspring. Their presence is associated with cytoplasmic incompatibility in several species of Drosophila. Cytoplasmic incompatibility results when the sperm of infected males fertilize eggs of uninfected females, causing more or less intense embryonic mortality (unidirectional incompatibility). This phenomenon also appears in crosses between populations infected with different Wolbachia strains (bidirectional incompatibility). The influence of Wolbachia infection on host populations has attracted attention as a potentially rapid mechanism for development of reproductive isolation and subsequent speciation. We examined the influence of this bacterium on reproductive isolation in interspecific crosses between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. We found that Wolbachia infection negatively affected these two species in homospecific crosses. However, in interspecific crosses, it only influenced sexual isolation, as infected females more frequently hybridized than females free of infection; postzygotic reduction of fitness (bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility) was not detected. This would be explained by the existence of several modes of rescue systems in these two species, reducing cytoplasmic incompatibility between them. Wolbachia does not appear to cause reproductive isolation between these two species.",2009,"I N Gazla, M C Carracedo, I N Gazla, M C Carracedo"
A gene located at 72A in Drosophila melanogaster encodes a novel zinc-finger protein that interacts with protein kinase CK2,11827180,,"Drosophila melanogaster protein kinase CK2 (DmCK2) is a Ser/Thr protein kinase composed of catalytic alpha and regulatory beta subunits associated as an alpha2beta2 heterotetramer.

One of these cDNAs encodes a novel previously undescribed zinc-finger protein, which we call ZFP47. ZFP47 interacts with DmCK2alpha but not with DmCK2beta, indicating that this interaction is specific for the catalytic subunit of CK2. In situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes indicates that the corresponding gene is located at the 72A interval of chromosome III. Sequence analysis indicates that ZFP47 contains a consensus site for phosphorylation by CK2, 4 C1H1-type zinc-fingers, and a bipartite nuclear localization signal. Consistent with the prediction of a site for phosphorylation by CK2, we demonstrate that ZFP47 is phosphorylated by CK2 purified from Drosophila embryos.

Half of these fragments represent single-copy sequences in the genome. Six single-copy fragments were investigated in detail, and each was found to reside near a transcription unit whose expression in the embryo is segmentally modulated as expected for targets of homoeotic genes. Four of these putative target genes are expressed in patterns that suggest roles in the development of regional specializations within mesoderm derivatives; in three cases these expression patterns depend on Ultrabithorax function. Extrapolation from this pilot study indicates that 85-170 candidate target genes can be identified by screening the entire Drosophila genome with UBX isoform Ia.

Therefore, in this study, we have aimed to investigate the possible functioning of DNA methyltransferase in Drosophila. The 14 K oligo microarray slide was incubated with native cell extract from adult Drosophila to check the presence of the methyltransferase activity. After incubation under appropriate conditions, the methylated oligo sequences were identified by the binding of anti 5-methylcytosine monoclonal antibody. The antibody bound to the methylated oligos was detected using Cy3 labeled secondary antibody. Methylation sensitive restriction enzyme mediated PCR was used to assess the methylation at a few selected loci identified on the array. It could be seen that a few of the total oligos got methylated under the assay conditions. Analysis of methylated oligo sequences provides evidence for the presence of de novo methyltransferase activity and allows identification of its sequence specificity in adult Drosophila. With the help of methylation sensitive enzymes we could detect presence of CpC methylation in the selected genomic regions.

      To study the effects of anthocyanins from Xinjiang black mulberry fruit on the lifespan and antioxidant system of Drosophila melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Drosophila were divided into five groups based on the content of anthocyanins in culture medium. The lifespan of drosophila was tested by survival experiments, including median lethal time, average life-span and average maximum life-span. The activity of antioxidant enzymes of drosophila, including glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and the content of maleic diadehyde (MDA), were tested after being fed for 30 days.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The lifespan of drosophila were prolonged with the increase of anthocyanins. Median lethal time, average lifespan and average maximum lifespan of drosophila in the groups fed with anthocyanins at the content of 27.27 mg/kg and 112.5 mg/kg were longer than those in controls, and in a dose-response relationship. The activities of GSH-Px, SOD and CAT increased and MDA content decreased significantly with the increase of anthocyanins in a dose-response relationship. The activity of three antioxidant enzymes was the highest and MDA concentration was the lowest in the group fed with anthocyanins at the content of 11.25 mg/100g when compared with the controls.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The activities of three antioxidant enzymes could be enhanced and the process of lipid peroxidation could be inhibited by anthocyanins, which might be one of the reasons for prolonging the lifetime of Drosophila melanogaster.",2010,"Yan Jiang, Yan Jiang"

We have also compared and contrasted the immune response of the host with respect to two nonenveloped viruses, Drosophila C virus (DCV) and Drosophila X virus (DXV). We determined that SIGMAV infection upregulates expression of the peptidoglycan receptor protein genes PGRP-SB1 and PGRP-SD and the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes Diptericin-A, Attacin-A, Attacin-B, Cecropin-A1, and Drosocin. SIGMAV infection did not induce PGRP-SA and the AMP genes Drosomycin-B, Metchnikowin, and Defensin that are upregulated in DCV and/or DXV infections. Expression levels of the Toll and Imd signaling cascade genes are not significantly altered by SIGMAV infection. These results highlight shared and unique aspects of the Drosophila immune response to the three viruses and may shed light on the nature of the interaction with the host and the evolution of these associations.",2008,"C W Tsai, E A McGraw, E-D Ammar, R G Dietzgen, S A Hogenhout, C W Tsai, E A McGraw, E-D Ammar, R G Dietzgen, S A Hogenhout"

Thus, the analysis on the metabolism of C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in Drosophila was implemented with high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Fatty acid (FA) analysis of the whole body, head, and thorax-abdomen in Drosophila showed C20 PUFA could only be found in Drosophila fed diets supplemented with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and arachidonic acid (ARA), but not in Drosophila fed base diets.

The antigenic material is, however, present in these cells. Moreover, we noticed a certain proportion of acentriolar cells in 4 other 1182 lines.

Identification of Genes Mediating Drosophila Follicle Cell Progenitor Differentiation by Screening for Modifiers of GAL4::UAS Variegation,27866148,10.1534/g3.116.036038,"The Drosophila melanogaster ovarian follicle cell lineage provides a powerful system for investigating how epigenetic changes contribute to differentiation. Downstream from an epithelial stem cell, follicle progenitors undergo nine mitotic cell cycles before transitioning to the endocycle and initiating differentiation. During their proliferative phase, follicle progenitors experience Lsd1-dependent changes in epigenetic stability that can be monitored using GAL4::UAS variegation. Eventually, follicle progenitors acquire competence to respond to Delta, a Notch ligand present in the environment, which signals them to cease division and initiate differentiation. The time required to acquire competence determines the duration of mitotic cycling and hence the final number of follicle cells. We carried out a screen for dominant modifiers of variegation spanning nearly 70% of Drosophila euchromatin to identify new genes influencing follicle progenitor epigenetic maturation. The eight genes found include chromatin modifiers, but also cell cycle regulators and transcription factors. Five of the modifier genes accelerate the acquisition of progenitor competence and reduce follicle cell number, however, the other three genes affect follicle cell number in an unexpected manner.",2017,"Ming-Chia Lee, Andrew D Skora, Allan C Spradling, Ming-Chia Lee, Andrew D Skora, Allan C Spradling"

Spontaneous magnetic orientation in larval Drosophila shares properties with learned magnetic compass responses in adult flies and mice,23239891,10.1242/jeb.077404,"We provide evidence for spontaneous quadramodal magnetic orientation in a larval insect. Second instar Berlin, Canton-S and Oregon-R × Canton-S strains of Drosophila melanogaster exhibited quadramodal orientation with clusters of bearings along the four anti-cardinal compass directions (i.e. 45, 135, 225 and 315 deg). In double-blind experiments, Canton-S Drosophila larvae also exhibited quadramodal orientation in the presence of an earth-strength magnetic field, while this response was abolished when the horizontal component of the magnetic field was cancelled, indicating that the quadramodal behavior is dependent on magnetic cues, and that the spontaneous alignment response may reflect properties of the underlying magnetoreception mechanism. In addition, a re-analysis of data from studies of learned magnetic compass orientation by adult Drosophila melanogaster and C57BL/6 mice revealed patterns of response similar to those exhibited by larval flies, suggesting that a common magnetoreception mechanism may underlie these behaviors. Therefore, characterizing the mechanism(s) of magnetoreception in flies may hold the key to understanding the magnetic sense in a wide array of terrestrial organisms.",2013,"Michael S Painter, David H Dommer, William W Altizer, Rachel Muheim, John B Phillips, Michael S Painter, David H Dommer, William W Altizer, Rachel Muheim, John B Phillips"

In this assay the Drosophila larva apparently modulates its pattern of locomotion when faced with a choice between a dark and lit environment by orienting its movement towards the dark environment. We show that, in this assay, a response to light can be measured as an increase in residence time in the dark versus the lit quadrant. Mutations that disrupt phototransduction in the adult Drosophila abolish the larval response to light, demonstrating that this larval visual function is similar to that of the adult fly. Similarly, no response to light was detected in strains where the larval visual system (photoreceptors and target area) was disrupted by a mutation in the homeobox containing gene sine oculis (so) gene. Ablation of photoreceptors by the targeted expression of the cell death gene hid under the control of the photoreceptor-specific transcription factor glass (gl) abolishes this response entirely.

With both substrate couples the reaction was consistent with an ordered Bi Bi mechanism. The substrates added to the enzyme in a compulsory order, with coenzyme as the leading substrate, to give two interconverting ternary complexes. The second ternary complex broke down with release of products in an obligatory order, with the aldehyde/ketone leaving first. Both the acetaldehyde and acetone products formed binary complexes with the enzyme that affected NAD+ binding. However, only an enzyme-acetone complex seemed to affect NADH binding and hence the reverse reaction. The inhibitory pattern with acetaldehyde as product was also affected by the formation of a ternary enzyme-NAD(+)-acetaldehyde complex, which broke down to acetic acid and NADH. The product-inhibition pattern shown in the present work is different from that published for Drosophila Adh previously and this discrepancy can not be explained by the use of different variants of Drosophila Adh.",1994,"J O Winberg, J S McKinley-McKee, J O Winberg, J S McKinley-McKee"
Quantitative comparison of cis-regulatory element (CRE) activities in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster,22215325,10.3791/3395,"Gene expression patterns are specified by cis-regulatory element (CRE) sequences, which are also called enhancers or cis-regulatory modules. A typical CRE possesses an arrangement of binding sites for several transcription factor proteins that confer a regulatory logic specifying when, where, and at what level the regulated gene(s) is expressed. The full set of CREs within an animal genome encodes the organism's program for development, and empirical as well as theoretical studies indicate that mutations in CREs played a prominent role in morphological evolution. Moreover, human genome wide association studies indicate that genetic variation in CREs contribute substantially to phenotypic variation. Thus, understanding regulatory logic and how mutations affect such logic is a central goal of genetics. Reporter transgenes provide a powerful method to study the in vivo function of CREs. Here a known or suspected CRE sequence is coupled to heterologous promoter and coding sequences for a reporter gene encoding an easily observable protein product. When a reporter transgene is inserted into a host organism, the CRE's activity becomes visible in the form of the encoded reporter protein. P-element mediated transgenesis in the fruit fly species Drosophila (D.) melanogaster has been used for decades to introduce reporter transgenes into this model organism, though the genomic placement of transgenes is random. Hence, reporter gene activity is strongly influenced by the local chromatin and gene environment, limiting CRE comparisons to being qualitative. In recent years, the phiC31 based integration system was adapted for use in D. melanogaster to insert transgenes into specific genome landing sites. This capability has made the quantitative measurement of gene and, relevant here, CRE activity feasible. The production of transgenic fruit flies can be outsourced, including phiC31-based integration, eliminating the need to purchase expensive equipment and/or have proficiency at specialized transgene injection protocols. Here, we present a general protocol to quantitatively evaluate a CRE's activity, and show how this approach can be used to measure the effects of an introduced mutation on a CRE's activity and to compare the activities of orthologous CREs. Although the examples given are for a CRE active during fruit fly metamorphosis, the approach can be applied to other developmental stages, fruit fly species, or model organisms. Ultimately, a more widespread use of this approach to study CREs should advance an understanding of regulatory logic and how logic can vary and evolve.",2011,"William A Rogers, Thomas M Williams, William A Rogers, Thomas M Williams"

The Drosophila OAT has characteristics of leader peptides present in mitochondrial proteins. Immunoblotting experiments using polyclonal antibodies against the partial sequence of the OAT protein revealed that the OAT monomer has a molecular mass of 44 kDa.

Insights from Drosophila melanogaster model of Alzheimer's disease,31585881,,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common chronic neurodegenerative disease that mainly affects the medial temporal lobe and associated neocortical structures. The disease process involves two abnormal structures, plaques and tangles, which damage and destroy nerve cells. Tangles are twisted fibers of tau protein that build up inside cells. Plaques are deposits of a protein fragment called amyloid-beta (Aβ) that accumulate in the spaces between nerve cells. Aβ derives from the amyloid precursor protein and is the main component of amyloid plaques in the AD brain. Although AD has been extensively examined, its pathogenetic mechanisms remain unclear and there are currently no effective drugs for this disorder. Many AD model systems have recently been established using Drosophila melanogaster by expressing the proteins involved in AD in the brain. These systems successfully reflect some of the symptoms associated with AD such as the onset of learning defects, age-dependent short-term memory impairment, increase of wakefulness and consolidated sleep disruption by expressing human Aβ42 or human APP/BACE in Drosophila central nervous system.

Therefore, to elucidate the impact of AgNPs on behavior and metabolism, systematic and detailed dosages study of AgNPs was performed by rearing Drosophila melanogaster on food without and with AgNPs. We found that dietary intake of AgNPs at early larval stage leads to behavioral abnormalities such as poor crawling and climbing ability of larvae and adults respectively. Interestingly, intake of higher dosage of AgNPs at larval stage significantly altered metabolic activity that includes lipid, carbohydrate and protein levels in adult flies. Further, detailed analysis revealed that AgNPs causes remarkable reduction in the number of lipid droplets (LDs) which are lipid storage organelles in Drosophila. We also observed an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AgNPs ingested larval tissues.

We have found that a hypomorphic mutation of Tequila (Teq(f01792)), as well as cell-specific downregulation of Tequila in insulin-producing neurons of the fly, significantly extends life span. Tequila deficiency-induced life-span extension is likely to be associated with reduced insulin-like signaling, because Tequila mutant flies display several common phenotypes of insulin dysregulation, including reduced circulating Drosophila insulin-like peptide 2 (Dilp2), reduced Akt phosphorylation, reduced body size, and altered glucose homeostasis.

The results revealed significant increase in life span of Drosophila flies on exposure to both the plant products, more efficiently by C. Longa than by E. officinalis. In order to understand whether the increase in lifespan was due to high-antioxidant properties of these medicinal plants, we performed enzymatic assays to assess the SOD and catalase activities in case of both treated and control Drosophila flies.

These genes can then be expressed and the functions of the gene products directly evaluated by biochemical assays. In this study, we used this approach to determine the function of a putative Drosophila nucleotide sugar transporter gene. The results showed that this gene encodes a protein that can transport UDP-galactose, but not CMP-sialic acid. Thus, Drosophila encodes at least some of the infrastructure needed to produce glycoproteins with complex glycans, but this particular gene product does not directly support glycoprotein sialylation. These findings are relevant to insect cell biology and to an informed consideration of insect cell expression systems as tools for recombinant glycoprotein production.",2002,"Jared J Aumiller, Donald L Jarvis, Jared J Aumiller, Donald L Jarvis"
Genetic control of cuticle formation during embryonic development of Drosophila melanogaster,12019232,,"The embryonic cuticle of Drosophila melanogaster is deposited by the epidermal epithelium during stage 16 of development. This tough, waterproof layer is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the larval body. We have characterized mutations in a set of genes required for proper deposition and/or morphogenesis of the cuticle. Zygotic disruption of any one of these genes results in embryonic lethality. Mutant embryos are hyperactive within the eggshell, resulting in a high proportion reversed within the eggshell (the ""retroactive"" phenotype), and all show poor cuticle integrity when embryos are mechanically devitellinized. This last property results in embryonic cuticle preparations that appear grossly inflated compared to wild-type cuticles (the ""blimp"" phenotype). We find that one of these genes, krotzkopf verkehrt (kkv), encodes the Drosophila chitin synthase enzyme and that a closely linked gene, knickkopf (knk), encodes a novel protein that shows genetic interaction with the Drosophila E-cadherin, shotgun. We also demonstrate that two other known mutants, grainy head (grh) and retroactive (rtv), show the blimp phenotype when devitellinized, and we describe a new mutation, called zeppelin (zep), that shows the blimp phenotype but does not produce defects in the head cuticle as the other mutations do.",2002,"Stephen Ostrowski, Herman A Dierick, Amy Bejsovec, Stephen Ostrowski, Herman A Dierick, Amy Bejsovec"
"[Analysis of DNA interband regions 3A5/A6, 3C5-6/c7 and 60E8-9/E10 of Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes]",11771302,,"Using electron microscopic (EM) data on the formation of a novel band from the P-element material after its insertion in the interband and the procedure of P-target rescue, DNA interband regions 3A5/A6, and 60E8-9/E10 of Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes were cloned and sequenced. EM analysis of the 3C region have shown that the formation of the full-size 3C5-6/C7 interband requires a 880-bp DNA sequences removed by deletion Df(1)faswb. A comparison of DNA sequences of six bands, two of which were obtained in the present work and four were described earlier, demonstrated the uniqueness of each of them in the Drosophila genome and heterogeneity of their molecular organization. Interband 60E8-9/E10 contains gene rpl19 transcribed throughout the development, in particular in salivary glands. In the other interbands examined 5' and 3' nontranslated gene regions are located. These results suggest that Drosophila interbands may contain both housekeeping genes and regulatory sequences of currently inactive genes from adjacent bands.",2001,"S A Demakov, A A Gorchakov, Iu B Shvarts, V F Semeshin, I F Zhimulev, S A Demakov, A A Gorchakov, Iu B Shvarts, V F Semeshin, I F Zhimulev"
